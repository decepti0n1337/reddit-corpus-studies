Since the 31th of jan update, there is no longer a search option for chem containers when using Pharma Farma.

Pre patch:

The recon scope(on a hunting rifle) sometimes “sticks” after shooting when you ads. So even if you if release the ads button it still somehow looks down the sight.
---
During horde events, the horde boss would sometimes be killed by random enemies just before you fast travel to them. 
---
---
---
You shouldn't blindly buy anything. That's irresponsible and fucking stupid.
---
Sorting by weight has always been my go to; learnables are the only notes that weigh anything. A separate tab would be nice for sure but this works pretty nicely until then.

"Younger"
---
You dont read statistics before you give an opinion do you?
---
72% of online gamers are over 18
---
43% of online gamers are over 36
---
https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players-since-2010/
---
Ah yes, the easy route. go for it my man. 
---
Well after 50 you can move points 1 at a time. Not exactly what your looking for but it does make a difference and let you change up your play style
---
&gt; If everyone of us on this subreddit is level 50 or higher, we represent less than 13% of players. And 93% of players havent killed the SBQ yet. So the people on this sub that cry for PvE content because theyve done everything, represent less than 7% of players. Most people still have a lot of PvE to do.
---
While that's true, you're not considering (at least judging by your post) that a vast majority of those people have quit playing this game. It's not that they're casual, it's that they're totally absent. I have a friend who play this casually and are about lvl 50 now on their first toon. The majority of my friends who started fo76 with me don't play anymore. There were 6 of us, now it's just two.
---
Have a poopy day.
---
Bye bye Felicia 
---
Bethesda said they are aware of the issue and will fix it.   
---
Lol good
---
Serious question and no „hate“ implied: are you serious or is this advanced sarcasm? Bc if you’re serious: what is balance for you? While I totally agree that it shouldn’t be possible to one shot a mirelurk queen, which I could, so is the fact that it shouldn’t be possible that you have to go full melee or else you have to grind for ammo all day long. I literally couldn’t do any serious dmg against a level 10 crafton Monster the other day it nearly killed me. 
---
And people enjoy saying this because it makes them feel superior.
---
I like it uses .308. makes it unique, kinda. but it's definitely an oversight that you can only craft bundles of 12.
---
I can only imagine a two shot mirv
---
Didnt see anything different on Grahm a minute ago
---
Hahahahaha
---
yes, this is old but still an issue.  would love to rep the BoS look but not if it means I lose the stats of the underamor. 
---
So you agree, with an addition that legendary enemies should always drop at least a 1-star item?
---
If they made private servers it would be like fo4 and allow for modding on all 3 consoles. Hopefully they do it soon because at this point it is obvious Bethesda doesn't know what they are doing.
---
Nothing because scrap all doesn't scrap items in your stash. 
---
He has no idea.  Just like he doesn't know the percent of the game population that overlaps this sub Reddit.  Hell, Bethesda doesn't know exactly how much overlap there is either.  Best they could do is look at active account totals and figure out a guess based on this subs population.
---
It's a guess, because your active Beth account is tied to one account that they know plays.  There can be any number of accounts owned by the same person here, and some accounts might not play the game at all.
---
So yeah, his % of the population is less informed than Bethesda's guess.
---
I dunno. I made an alt after the xp nerf and it was quite different.
---
And playing now is quite different too.
---
Sure, those tweets are using hyperbole a bit but why is negative feedback allowed hyperbole and positive isn't?
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I don’t even know what min-maxing _is_.
---
Also the haters are ignoring how absolutely responsive and engaged Beth is being with all of the staff posting here on reddit taking bug reports and releasing a hot fix _the next day_ upon getting reports of the bulk autoscrap and bobby pin weight.
---
The recent posts calling for Beth to “shut down the game” over the weight of an in-game tool are pathetically ridiculous and embarrassing. 
---
It’s just a game ffs
---
I feel the same way, Im level 46 &amp; I only ever see people who are 100+ who want nothing to do with me 
---
Just stop this senseless fanboy crusade and realize when you've been beaten. Ignore us if you must, but stop embarrassing yourself by trying to defend gutter trash and maybe you'll save your reputation as a gamer.
---
Offensive? lol what. I'm pretty sure there is no way I'd ever by offended by a video game. Something that has been around since the dawn of modern MMOs and even in MUDs is considered an exploit? If they have a problem with people crafting too much, maybe they should work on balance instead of banning people for doing what they are naturally going to do.  
---
I was seriously going to buy this game for my gf and I in a couple months, but you have opened my eyes to exactly how inept the developers are. Luckily Skyrim coop is just around the corner.
---
 I don't think there is better armor. Certainly there are Legendary drops, which can be amazing though. ;)
---
53 years old and infantile enough to make the preposterous claim that casuals were mostly running TSE. 
---
I mean I didn't buy it the remastered personally, just pointing out that the idea that its a newer game doesn't make it unique.
---
Same here..
---
I don't think anyone is being toxic. I think a lot of us have been poisoned lol.
---
Oh ok, I misunderstood the word inventory 
---
Melee will be nerfed as well, better scale system after lvl 50 should be applied, new pve content to come. Very happy with feedback and Bethesda listening to community. Sooo, yeah I’m happy with direction game is going. Also f@ck dupers!
---
There is no such thing as a universal industry standard for software development. It all just comes down to companies that are on top of their shit and companies stuck in a shit storm. You’ll be surprised there are still people that operate under a waterfall model.
---
Depends on location I think 
---
Yes
---
Finally some intelligent post. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not because it isn't critical, but because it offers objective analysis and doesn't play a drama queen.
---
Deleting threads? I didn’t realize they controlled Reddit.
---
Melee doesn't need anything on top. If anything its going to get notched down a peg.
---
&gt; Uncommon is when applying an update that requires additional, not planned development
---
This is a Point (or Spot) Release.
---
I don't think I've ever heard of bugfixes unhappening like this before
---
Im camped out in the mire and even before this patch I would get attacked as soon as I spawn in.
---
Need a different acronym:
---
D.U.M.P.
---
or
---
T.R.A.S.H.
---
Calling the game a pile of shit and telling Bethesda that they're incompetent does not help the game get fixed. If you don't like the game, quit playing it and quit crying about it. Plenty of other games out there...
---
Yes. They can. What fucking world are you living in?  They can ban you from one or every game with zero reason. Do you live under a rock?
---
I wouldn't say least effective, at least the materials that sell for exactly 10 or 20 caps bulked are actually a great way to empty out a vendor easily. Apart from aluminium and lead, I don't stash anything bulked, and I actually use bulking to keep the mats in my stash at bay (50 of each and 200 of screws, springs, etc in my case).
---
I appreciate the info. I agree that the well rested bonus increase is notable and worth knowing.
---
Well I’m lvl 175, a bit hard to go from demolition expert to stealth build.
---
Lol I'm down. XB1 
---
Maybe, but it happens all the same, which is why I fucking brought it up. 
---
Sure: I’ll show my build later this week. I would do  it sooner but my xbox isn’t connecting to the net for some reason.
---
your optimism is amassing  cause Bathesda has been dropping the ball since day one and they appear to not care one bit if you want to see how to deal with a community and fix a broken game look at Owlcat and Pathfinder Kingmaker's history they put out a decent game that was broken but now it is very good and already has DLC and it was launched a few months before FO76 and Owlcat is nowhere as big as Bathesda 
---
The owner is the same, so you would expect some synergies 
---
OMG Me too!
---
My poor friend is still playing and constantly texting me complaints...
---
I'm open to suggestions haha
---
Oh man, really? I seriously hope that they at least raised ledge chances overall everywhere. More nerfs with no positive changes will _not_ go down well with the community
---
Buddy
---
That age group that’s “already older than 18” is a generation younger than those of us who’ve played fallout since it was called wasteland. 
---
I didn’t mean younger *than you*. I meant younger than the fallout franchise’s crowd that’s accrued over the ages. It has **lots** of older people. The fallout sandwich (everything you love about America on top, everything you hate about it down below, you, a big gun and no law or morality restrictions in the middle) has sunk its emotional teeth into many, many people over the eons. 
---
Often (but not always) there’s a cost-driven glass wall between them, because younger people (my kids for example) have more access to $200 appliances and less access to $1000+ PC game rigs. And they gravitate to where the rest of their friends are, which is.. the $200 appliances. Older people have better access to disposable income, and the % they make up of the PC crowd is higher. 
---
People not looking at the bigger picture and basing their impressions on who they meet in-game might often conclude that everyone on PS4 (or worse, “in the game”) is young because they’re on PS4, and people on PC might conclude the opposite. Reality is somewhere in between.
---
Do you want a tissue, and maybe a hug?
---
I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. I tried to say zenimax rushed the game out when it wasnt ready, that bethesda wasnt used to online games so wasnt communicating their ideas with their community, that their design choices were for the long term health of the game. In the end now I can see that its all just horrible design or plain laziness. 
---
Ill still come back to the game and i still enjoy it. Ive gotten almost 400 hours of gameplay out of it. But i have to wait until bethesda gets their shit together before i come back to playing it everyday.
---
Yeah, I've noticed the damage lag as well lately.
---
Not recently, but I once encountered an invincible bloodbug that kicked my ass due to their poison effect from repeated stings.
---
While you're doing that I'll agro a scorchbeast to you and jump servers. 🤣
---
That's fair. Maybe toxic is the wrong word. It just feels like everyone is actively ignoring the other side of things, or twisting stuff to justify their feelings 
---
As someone who doesn't even know what TSE stands for, I'm just going to assume I fall under the "casual" category lol. I just got my first set of Power Armor at 40 ; the idea of launching a nuke and fighting the scorch queen hasn't even passed my mind yet.
---
Mostly I liked this post but something that bothered me.
---
&gt;But that self-awareness is lost, again as evidenced by a simple reading of the current top ranking post about not defending Bethesda. It includes the line "The vast majority of us..."
---
&gt;STOP. FULL STOP. nope. you and this sub ARE NOT THE VAST MAJORITY OF FO76 players. you ain't! I'm sorry.
---
Either you're being a dick on purpose here or you're missing the context of the word us. Us as in the people here... on this subreddit.
---
Why what?   I guess I don’t really understand what your saying.    
---
They wanted to balance in a manor that would cause people to try other perks is kinda what they said.   But they nerfed the demo perk to the point where people are going from 3pts in to 5pts in to gain back a bit of the damage we lost.   
---
If youre on xbox, add me. Well figure this thing out. lol
---
Well I mean pretty much any top tier weapon can 1 shot a ghoul, but for instance, I can’t 1 shot a level 30 assaultron with a headshot. 
---
It’s a board so... I’m gonna say that’s ridiculous numbers for a board
---
Despite what you may have been taught, work is not an exercise in frustration and masochism. If you can do the same thing easier somewhere else you would be silly not to. So if someone wants to say that's taking the easy way I would say 'Yes it is, and if you don't take the easy way then more fool you'
---
I'm not going to say you don't have valid points, heck I agree in principle with some of it.   
---
  
---
But...   
---
As much as we have a culture addicted to outrage, this time (I'll admit a bias) I think people have a point.   
---
Best example is my own, after the patch last week I've been seeing 9+ CTD's an hour, I'd call that an issue worth getting frustrated and outraged over, the majority of the games content I've not been able to interact with, because I've not been able to finish any quest that lasts more than 10'ish minutes.  
---
I also think there is justification regarding the "balance" anger, what was done to "fix" the TSE issue was short sighted and has created far more problems than it solved. Maybe that sounds arrogant, but I've summarized some of the points others made that would have been considerably better in another post on this thread.  
---
As to it being a crisis.. Allot of that really depends on numbers Bethesda isn't going to show us. Some of the data people have lined indicates a massive drop in players since launch, and based on the general feedback the last few weeks I'd have to believe they've had another major group of players leave the "world".   Loosing massive amounts of customers on a game based around a long term microtranaction platform IS a Crisis.
---
 I bought Heavy Combat Legs from him an hour ago. Have never seen them before. I thought Heavy Combat plans were a myth. ;) 
---
 I could hear him, searched frantically, and finally found him under the bridge at Camden park. ;)
---
Yep. It was like a 840 mb update
---
Same to you 
---
Jump. If you want to avoid the damages from the SBQ, just jump. All scorchbeasts aim at your feet, if you run and jump, you minimize the damage a lot.
---
It also creates a power imbalance between the people who bought them at the cheaper price and those who didn't.
---
OP, while you are correct that this is the *original* definition of the term, it has not strictly been the only definition for quite some time. There is over a decade of precedent where software vendors used it to make a distinction between normal patches and quick fixes outside of normal development. The definition Bethesda used may not be the original, but it is accepted and understood.
---
Language evolves as the words are used. If a word is used outside of it's original definition, but the intent is still understood then the definitions gradually change. After all, if someone were to say the bugs in the latest patch were "awful" would you demand to know what part of it was "worthy of awe"? This post just comes off as unnecessarily nitpicky, like complaining when someone says "literally" to draw emphasis on something that was not literally true.
---
It would be nice if it was easier to see the total weight of a given stack of Bulked materials, yes.
---
None of the daily quests are offered daily
---
No, bit this post was written by an ignorant person who doesn't understand how reddit operates 
---
The game is screwed no one responds back to anyone from Bethesda so it seems like they don’t care. 
---
Yeah, I think it's just something up with my client.
---
I’m reading about this wondering when people said bulk items were auto scrapping, i was curious if you got the plastic back :(
---
I’m sorry for your loss!
---
Loving this suggestions.
---
Also I'd add the blast zone not appearing in everyone's map. Just a "can't fast travel" warning if you try to get in, so you can roughly figure out where is the nuked zone.
---
Another good thing would be the bombarded mobs getting nuke counters every minute or so, until killed, and for each counter they hit with more radiation, maybe get more health,  but get some more percentage (not much, like .05) to give an additional item or an item from a higher loot table.
---
👍🏽
---
If skyrim is your “top favorite game” you really need to expand your pallet 
---
[removed]
---
You modding your game is not Bethesda accepting mods into official code. 
---
Also, the fact is, the most passionate players of the fanbase **will** find their way to either this subreddit or the bethesda forums. The two largest outlets for people who care to have a discussion about FO76.
---
Rad arches cure mutations in my experience I lost two that way but regained them later.
---
+37% melee damage is pretty sweet. Looks like I gotta keep huggin ghouls
---
How I feel about the world irl.
---
When voicing that you enjoy the game results with downvotes, insults, and having my comment history raided, yeah, it’s fucking toxic. 
---
And if a bad game can “poison” you, then you were a shit human being to begin with. 
---
Why buff it back up when its aligned with other methods of increasing damage?
---
"This is fine" -N3utro sitting in the room of fire that is Fallout 76.
---
I don't think even if I was paid to stay on and play this game, i would. Its just that bad right now. 
---
Oh, a hidden luck perk. Does it work on SAMs as well? Or on broken terminals in transmission towers? I think I have 7 points in luck, so I have never seen this dialogue.
---
There's a perception check somewhere
---
Well I got em outside of bleeding Kate's on xbox if anyone wants to see for themselves. Join me subsidingcross2 
---
You can also kill scorchbeasts. Easier said than done, I know. But if you found Fort Defiance you can get the help of some turrets and artillery.
---
Yeah. Unfortunately that is just how it is. It sucks because I'm always hyped for them, and then this. 🤷‍♂️
---
The registry cleaner itself is fine, it only shows you items no longer used by installed programs. 
---
It's when you start to dig and allow permissions it didnt originaly ask for where you can start mucking things up.
---
I've been a CCleaner user and recommended for years, it's great for mom and dad who still have no real computer knowledge because they are too afraid to monkey around in setting.
---
Dunno I do fine with doing 230ish damage with a normal powerfist, not sure what people want
---
Well said, Todd. Thank you for posting. 
---
You have to make everyone take rad x so unstable isotope, electrically charged and talons don't skew the fights.
---
Theres another event where you can sink barrels into a lake if you have agility of 5
---
This is the case in almost every game.
---
Yeah I saw a video of 8 guys with TSE and it took them more than 20 minutes to kill her. I wonder if Bethesda even tests these patches.
---
 [r/noteveryoneisrich](https://youtu.be/9oRAbFwxLsA) 
---
So this has been happening... not sure if it was related to the patch or had always been there.
---
I landed at whitesprings in the parking lot near the club house. I shit you not, as soon as it finished fully loading I was mear death and a grounded scorchbeastAND deathclaw were  tag teaming me.
---
You know that if you post something and then delete it it still shows up in my inbox right?
---
&gt; Have you read your edit alot about circle jerk why they left fallout reddit soon so forth.. It was definitely bitching about the game this reddit and the filthy reddit. I was pointing out a pointless bitch session. I was not inherently calling you immature and left it impersonal....but believe I don't have to. Then I even agreed with you on some points and you turned on me like I'm the bad guy. Also if you don't like the game,probably came over just to troll this sub, and generally like to be negative what is keeping you here. I mean I see you are a moderator so you understand why people should remain civil. Or am I reading your history incorrectly.
---
So much for not being worth it.
---
And my point was that you keep telling me I'm "bitching". While claiming the highroad.
---
Aww, I liked that my PA was marked with the atom shop icon randomly so I didn't have to play PA roulette 
---
Yep its a shit go and a rude awakening 
---
kill other players. Not griefing though. I never attacked anyone's base. Golden rule for me and the fact that I hate being wanted. No map sucks.
---
You joke but that would still be better than the majority of the base game. So please, bring it on! 
---
Even though I have enjoyed 76 from my start with it, I have no problem admitting that it has problems, some affecting me more then others. At the same time I am not one of these people that are "out for blood" over the situation. Either it will get better and I'll end up playing for years to come, or one day I'll lose interest and move onto a different game. It happens with all games eventually even "perfect" ones, one day when you log off/save and quit it will be for the last time.
---
Like i said, i only used it once in pvp. I use it in pve to clear silos and fissure sites for lower level players who want to launch nukes
---
I thought that this was the end game?! 
---
MMOs use it this way.
---
FFXIV frequently has "hotfixes" as impromptu maintenances that need the servers to go offline short notice.
---
Where did I say that negative hyperbole feedback is „allowed“? I clearly made my point in saying that it was as stupid. But now Iam tending to simply can’t take any positive feedback serious. You see, Iam getting downvoted and the generic positive counter comment getting upvotes. I simply don’t see it why people WANT to like this mess so hard. As I said, the expectations towards new games simply dropped in the last years and this is not a good tendency. This isn’t even the fault of the developers imo, this game shouldn’t have launched that early... honesty, Iam sorry for the developers, bc I think it wasn’t their choice to push this release 
---
I still don't understand why white knight was nerfed? I get trying to make things even, but regular armor and PA aren't even close to being the same thing. Power armor has more defense, and is useable in nuke zones where as non PA builds have to resort to the hazmat suit. It's got its strengths and uses, why should non PA builds suffer because the PA perk isn't as good? I don't even use power patcher and my power armor rarely breaks, my regular armor however breaks twice per session. 
---
If you want my opinion of the game overall, it's a fun game with lots of small but annoying problems.  If you hate inventory management, you will hate this game once you start hitting the stash limits.  I guess I saved you some money. :)
---
I agree on GTA Online. Which, I'll also add, had issues at launch and is still having issues today (less bugs, moreso people seem to be unhappy with changes that I haven't read up on - only read headlines.)
---
Red Eyed Mothman is a regular at my place, if when I spawn in my one and only turret is twatting away at something, I know it's him....look just do one mate, you perv.....
---
Report them
---
What?! Isn’t this the end game?! 
---
+1 bug with [Danger] when no enemies directly around. They'll be like on the other side of a city inside of a different building.
---
Yeah no kidding. That’s exactly what I was thinking. You really can’t even go by numbers without playing the game and see how it really does work out. I mean I believe that’s how guns got destroyed in the first place. Going by the numbers and not by the gameplay, if he had our own test server to try out these game breaking updates before they hit system wide. I really don’t think we would have half the problems in the game we currently do 
---
Nah. Fix the damn 21:9.
---
That's exactly what you're doing, buddy. "criticism bad, accepting shit good lol"
---
None with SAMs with a Luck of 8, can't speak for those that have a greater value though
---
Sounds like I haven't found THE game then. 
---
Yeah, I've been playing since the beta, and I just hit level 35 the other day. Yes, there have been bugs that have been extremely frustrating for me. I was unable to proceed on the Brotherhood storyline because of a bugged quest. What did I do? I looked online to see if there were any fixes, and when I came up short I took a break from the game. Checked in with this latest patch, and even though it wasn't in the patch notes, the quest was suddenly fixed for me.
---
Am I frustrated? Yeah! But I'm having fun with the game. I also work long hours and still have some semblance of a social life. If I take a couple weeks off from the game, chances are that would have been the next time I would have had an opportunity to play.
---
I can't fathom having 750 hours into the game only after two months. I barely scratch 300 on games that I feel I have played obsessively for years like Civilization, Crusader Kings and Stellaris.
---
All of those middle fingers bundled in the last patch was the real debbie downer though.
---
Watch the next one it says the ash pile was his friend 
---
Commonly, but I've been doing hotfixes for about a decade and it's always just meant work that was fairly immediate but unplanned, but not so bad that a full rollback is needed.
---
I listen to Spotify too but I'll add there's way more than ten songs on the radio. Someone made a Spotify playlist of every song on the radio and it's lengthy
---
No worries. Whenever you get a chance. 
---
Lmao
---
This.  I was so angry when people kept posting about fusion cores recharging if you logged out while in power armor.  
---
Explain to me how a hammer does more damage then a gun that shoots 2 bullets at a time?
---
I. DONT. WANT. TO. PLAY. AS. A. MELEE BUILD. I'm a midrange player I worked very very hard for my 2 TSE guns and built my character around that. Now Im being killed near immediately by level 35 robots as a level 101 in X01. This is beyond infuriating

Thats the datamined model and their promotional material for it so yes, that is it. ~enjoy!

Them mfn scorhbeast are way too intense man. They are way too hard to kill
---
Cool. I’m on XB1X myself. gamer tag: m1nd p0w3r
---
I agree with you, I like being in a state of denial! It's so much better than admitting I fucked up by buying this game and hoping it wouldn't be a buggy mess. Preach it, buddy!
---
Well I can give you at least one price to consider.
---
Calibrated shocks in the notes changed to 3000.
---
In game on a char with 4 Charisma and without Hard Bargain the cost is 6900.
---
Yeah they really need to fix dailies. Have they even addressed the issue?
---
just keep going to different ones. 
---
for me flatwoods, berkley and giant teapot and sutton didnt work. 
---
i enjoy my time and i feel its getting better with the patches. i hated the tse nerf, but I got around it and adapted to the meta shift. 
---
He does have those, I see them now
---
That’s a good point. I forgot about mutations. 
---
Yes plz. Id like to know what time I can come and sell and not feel rushed to do it all at once...
---
https://youtu.be/fwDO3zghYjY
---
I know lol, I was just exaggerating. I probably play more than I should so I hear the same songs on repeat far too often lol
---
... your analogy is better for character slots, not holding items.
---
Anyway, done arguing this with you. Holding items has never been an exploit, because trying to read intent is impossible. They could be holding gear for any number of reasons, and it's a really, REALLY loose (to the point of useless) definition of exploit to call mules exploits.
---
Oh trust me I have and a ton lot. I remember my first Fallout 3 run (my first fo game) oh how in love was I never played such a game with so much stuff to do. NV was a jew played it alot too . Fo4 well my PC was trash at the time of release so now that I have a better PC I can play it. 100+ hours still going. Fo 76 well we all know what happened.

Danny DeVito's Holy Trash Chute
---
Either I'm misunderstanding your post, or you misunderstood what he said. The way you say this, it sounds like you're saying 70k is how many people are on this subreddit and that they're not the majority (especially the posters), but that's not what u/steve_nice was saying. He was making a guess that there are only around 70k active players on any given platform, which totals up to around 210k players. 
---
That seems fairly shallow to me considering there are 171k subs to this subreddit. I'd guess there's closer to 500k total or 167k per platform if we assume the player base breakdown is relatively even per platform.
---
They should be hard for you.  You have no power armor on, no rad suit.  Idk, to me that just sounds like a bad idea stepping into a literal nuclear blast with some leather and pads on, and expecting it to be a viable build option.  Maybe the game shouldn't cater to every possible build.  It's part of why strong weapons are nerfed and shit weapons are boosted far beyond what they should be.
---
I mean is this whole post just trolling? Are you making this post to try and hop on the circle jerk and get some karma? What exactly is different now than the past 212 levels you played that makes everything so bad and terrible right now?
---
I'll pour some tea for my British homies. 
---
Probably get the blue arrows for this, but that’s the way it’s done.  As an old gamer who played EQ, WoW, DAoC,  and others, nerfs are always severe.  They are done to see how builds shift and where balance measures can be applied.  
---
And as always happens when they nerf the OP build Du Jour, outrage ensues.  Any developer worth their salt ignores the wailing and gnashing of teeth and concentrates on the numbers.  The numbers build a longer lasting game where their are more choices for end game builds and play styles.  
---
Also, nerfs are rarely permanent.  They will usually buff them up again once they figure out how to balance them against other factors.  
---
I’ve had many OP builds over the years go to crap for 6 months to a year before a few point respec made them very viable again.  With the rate that Bethesda is patching, I don’t believe I’ll sell my TSE’s any time soon.
---
Fallout 76 was hot garbage and fallout 4 was trash too imo. Bethesda is on thin ice for me. Skyrim is my favorite game ever and I loved Fallout 3 and New Vegas
---
The type of mistake an amateur modder would make, and never make again... but yet... here we are..
---
Seriously? Where exactly are they doing their hotfix tests? With a D20 dice on the damned coffee table?
---
Eh...
---
Nope been on reddit for a couple weeks and at that point wasn't searching for the high road didn't want to go through the motions of caring anymore 
---
Bye 
---
Translated:  I hate the game and you should too.  You are an idiot if you are enjoying Fallout 76...don’t be an idiot.  
---
Played a heavy in almost every game in the franchise as well as almost any game I play and I agree 100%
---
Annoying creatures indeed!
---
Well that needs to happen for sure anyways.  At least they need to lower the build cost of turrets and defensive structures.
---
Again, can’t tell if this sarcasm with your last sentence lol. Don’t get me wrong, it would be good if duplication glitches being patched, but unfortunately that isn’t the case... the old duping glitch from the early days is back apparently, since they just patched the game with an older version. If this game one day will bring some endgame content and is finally balanced, Iam happily coming back, bc i love fallout. 
---
It’s the Nocturnal effect. It’s not night so the damage is reduced. 
---
Can you not just drop it in a bag?
---
Skinner box man. Rather they did stuff like actually make an end to the overseer's quest...
---
Wow. Thank you. And this works for 76?
---
I like the game still
---
The most important point you made was the fact that this sub does not represent the majority of 76 players. 
---
People in this sub dismiss this notion regularly. Especially when complaining about thing being nerfed, not nerfed or not changed. 
---
TSEs? Every post, for or against always mentioned how everyone or no one wanted it based on this sub's opinion of the issue. 
---
Stash space? Same thing. "Everyone" knows it should be bigger and wants it to be bigger. 
---
As if BGS is tailoring updates solely to this sub. 
---
To be honest, BGS should largely ignore this sub and their opinions. QoL suggestions are usually OK, but mechanics and balancing? This sub's opinion isn't worth jack. 
---
That's how the ps4 updates.
---
You need 2x the space of the entire game to update it
---
yeah same thing offline where u are alone no other players. + all the mods
---
&gt; Team chat setting and a server browser
---
So you want the two things Bethesda have no intentions of adding? 
---
"you'll never even see a server!" - Todd Howard
---
'Text speak removes people from the immersion and world, so this is why were keeping with Voice Chat'.
---
Soz buddy.
---
Just curious are you high.
---
Looks like you’ve definitely put in your time! Great pictures
---
Cleveland Steamer Fix! 
---
Hotfixed already 
---
If you want a budget melee build (non-PA)
---
Spec fists. One card, 3 stars
---
You **cannot** use fists in power armor though
---
I can agree that it gets a monotonous through longer playthroughs. Lol Have you considered adding "Gold Dust Woman" by Fleetwood Mac to your playlist? May not be from the same period but it fits the feel.
---
Sorry I have never played a elder scrolls game so
---
You're absolutely right. They keep talking and talking, but in the end they don't amount to nothing.
---
And yet they're still putting out regressive patches.
---
Ok Karen
---
It's a God-tier roll and should be treated as such. And what does balanced PVP mean if no one does it anyway? You don't think that if people weren't doing it before patch they just magically would now?
---
I typically use it as a small update that was developed on the spot; typically something developed in a new branch split off of the release branch and it doesn't go through the normal branches as they may already have code changes against them that were not in that build. 
---
Sounds like the start of a class action lawsuit 
---
Thank you, yeah huge downside for me is I’m pure powerarmour, never spent any perks on non-powerarmour stuff, I’m not the smartest fo76 player to say the least
---
I have a 150 character, put a lot of time in the game, I do or did enjoy it, hard to say, i have the winter off up here in canada, so I have had time on my hands to play. I explored, crafted, killed, leveled, killed, been killed, been griefed etc etc. The game is still fun to me, I'm at the point though where I find myself hopping to find magazines to finish my atoms challenges, I noticed new ones added, but old ones still glitched. I understand both sides of the coin, as i was fluently trying to be positive, but upset that after 3 or 4 patches I'm still blue screening while I  walking, literally walking down a quiet road in my armor. Poor blue screen. That's what annoys me, i get fo always had bugs etc and this game, i knew when i bought it,, bugs. So I'm ok with them taking time to fix things for the whole player base. But when I blue screen when I'm standing looking at challenges, that can get annoying. I love fallout, I love the idea of it. But I just want to go for a walk and not blue screen 3 times. I play other games, overwatch, spiderman, dbx2. I just hope bethesda can actually get this running smoothly. Or at least as smooth as one can hope for haha. 
---
Just remember folks, were here for a good time, not a long time. 
---
https://m.facebook.com/groups/700425366803562?group_view_referrer=profile_browser
---
I have been one shot many times without firing a single shot so this is obviously a lie. Pacifist mode is a joke. I can't even play the game because griefers feel the need to kill low level players.
---
We only want a game that works properly, and is fun. We aren't making demands for Todd Howards first born. Just a decent game that 'just works'.  
---
Unfortunately, talking on the subreddit (while providing some remediation) hasn't gotten the message to BSG and Zenimax studios that the players are fed up.  So we move to the next step:
---
\-Uninstall Game
---
\-Continue to shine the light on the shoddy work and disrespect BGS and Zenimax have shown their fans. 
---
Eventually, F76 will be a 'good game', or it will fail. Either way, we will have made an effort. 
---
Tim is marketing. He's prepping for the next project in the works
---
DESTROYED!
---
(happy cake day btw) 
---
Belching betty?
---
&gt; wasn't searching for the high road
---
.
---
&gt; Lied about writing a long response to appear not bothered.
---
Kaaaaaay.
---
And I was here at launch too. I rented 76 at launch so I could see what all the fuss was about.
---
I'm glad I did because my game crashed while I was leaving the vault and I *still* don't have the achievement for leaving the vault. It's sort of a testament to the state of the game.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qrriKcwvlY
---
Yeah the amount shot up and not just legendary ghouls we’re dropping legendaries, diseased were as well
---
I ended up scrapping my jukebox because its tiny selection of music drove me crazy.
---
If this is accurate that is b.s. This is not something that happens with any other game I play.
---
Add an uninstall path.
---
Posts like this don’t help the Fallout community.
---
Too many “Bethesda haters” are telling other people how they need to enjoy the game, and what they are and aren’t allowed to do in the subreddit.
---
You’re saying “if you love the game, you’re not allowed to say anything because my opinion criticizing it is more important, for the good of the game”.
---
And that, is why this community is now trash.
---
I'm sure the investors would feel much better if no one is playing the game as long as they haven't bothered to uninstall because...uhh...umm...sorry but it's really hard here to come up with a joke reason that's more than just investors being really fucking stupid.
---
It happened to me all the time, but it would never allow me to place the items.
---
And I ask ‘what other methods’ because maybe there is a perk or ‘method’ I have overlooked that I could use to gain back some of my lost damage.  
---
I'm always open to suggestions and I did consider adding some Fleetwood Mac, but they just sound too clean and just missed the cut
---
Are we sure it's every 24-hours. I actually feel like it's slightly less than that. I feel like the vendors reset after around 20-22 hours after cap depletion.
---
I keep a list, and often times the vendors are definitely refreshed before that 24-hour mark. I'll try to find an exact figure, but was wondering if anyone else can confirm?
---
Heh, yeah, I tried that once in fo4.  ONCE!
---
Cheers
---
That’s OPs point, anyone persons Subjective experience doesn’t paint an accurate picture / neither does the collective subjective experience of the 1% of most invested fans on reddit. 
---
The point is rather then thinking “the devs must be useless/ignorant to make this decision that personally effected me” it’s more “What does this decision tell us about the larger picture the devs can see that we don’t” 
---
Good point. I guess I’ll have to at least sneak a few more levels in there just for the upgraded armor. Thanks. 
---
We need more than tea to get us out of this mess 😂
---
For real though. My newest base I told myself I wasn't going to put it no matter how badly I like the look of it, but I caved anyways lol
---
Oh my god could you guys circlejerk this bullshit any harder?
---
I'm guessing because you are a shotgunner, you have alot invested in strength which should make it easier to change to melee. I'm not sure if you're a casual gamer, but if you are, just go with what's fun for you. They've said that will buff other range abilities in the future (hopefully they'll actually do what they say) and I imagine melee might get a nerd because it's also incredibly overpowered in some ways
---
EXACTLY!! Nothing is different, that is my point! Iam simply lacking the motivation to oversee the new old bugs which are appearing again and again. And this whole „they’re listening to the community“ argument, I call bs... and no, i don’t give a damn about karma, Iam only on reddit for the fallout trading subs and don’t use it for anything else really. And since you can only get karma there when you have a conversation under a post, I don’t get any, bc I simply pm everyone. 
---
I tried a junkie shotgun build on FO76. Complete honesty here, I took every single chem I found, no perks to lower ability to get addicted or whatever....in 58 lvls I did not once get addicted to any chem.
---
I was bummed, but just changed it around to a critical shotgun build and it still works wonders
---
Yup 
---
Level 95
---
Agility 15 (17 w/ +2 from Resistant Raider Leathers)
---
Sneak level 3
---
Escape Artist
---
5pc chameleon armor set. 
---
Was able to be cloaked and enemies would walk right by me. Neber went into danger unless I was not sneaking and running into a mob of something. Now  post-patch they see me like Im standing there waving my hand and get hits off with their weapons when I'm on a rooftop cloaked in sneak when I should be in [hidden]. 
---
I've seriously never heard it used specifically the way you describe it, over probably the last 15 years in the tech industry. In any case there's obviously not such a clear distinction that one usage is right and another is wrong.
---
It's already been months since release. How much more time do they need? I'm not sure how anyone can be complacent that the game shipped as hot garbage and is no better off in that time.
---
In the IT world, true. Not always the case for software vendors.
---
But it's not their first time with a multiplayer game though. They just did a bad job...
---
I would like persistent servers over private... you end up building a server community.
---
Today? I meet a couple ppl... and then I may never see them again.
---
you won't though. TES6 comes out and you'll be there with your pre-order. 
---
Ok, thank you very much for the info! 
---
My favorite part is how you might have a Carrot sitting on the table in the wild, and presumably it's been there for the last 25 years and is still completely edible, but the minute you take it, it goes rotten in a half-hour.
---
Love that American flag one, where was that
---
His name is wooby
---
Was able to be cloaked and enemies would walk right by me. Neber went into danger unless I was not sneaking and running into a mob of something. 
---
Now  post-patch they see me like Im standing there waving my hand and get hits off with their weapons when I'm on a rooftop cloaked in sneak when I should be in [hidden]. 
---
You're doing something wrong, or not doing something right. I bounce off max caps a lot and I dont cheat, buy, sell and hit the vendors with spare weapons, junk and chems....the caps come rolling in....
---
Yeah I was sure that was happening, I was searching every enemy as I usually do and legendaries were popping up 
---
Le sigh.
---
I hope so... but that’s one thing out of numerous things which should be fixed. 
---
That's what I told myself to justify my shitty purchase. Hopefully you'll snap out of the denial just as I did.
---
"damn I deleted my 3* weapon by accident pls haaaalp" "we cannot restore in game items"
---
Lol dammit. Oh well. 
---
I very much doubt this, having a sneak build myself killing anything major (scorchbeasts etc) is taking ages. And since the patch hiding is mostly ineffective. Also, if I take out my sledgehammer I can kill mobs even easier without even any perks for it.
---
Yeah, haha. I only bring it up because a few years ago at my work place, we hired this new dude and he started installing/using it to "clean" registry on client computers and he was breaking all kinds of crap. A tool, like any other. Most useful when used correctly :)
---
I strongly agree.  A buddy of mine I work with said this exactly.   They always hit OP builds super hard, watch builds shift and numbers change, and continue to adjust accordingly.   And yes, I’ll be keeping my tse’s.   
---
Although I see allot of your points I think you're selling the community short, both in the size and impact.  
---
Based on some of the sales numbers that have been reported, (they vary quite a bit) this sub represents between 5% and 9% of the total sales for Console and PC combined.  
---
Even if it was 4%, that represents a statistically significant minority, and a large enough group to consider as a valid sample size.  
---
  M
---
Add in the fact the community keeps add members who are finding the sub JUST to try and work out the problems with '76 I think the voices here represent enough of the total active users of '76 to listen to.  
---
But then again, I'm very biased, I've got a post up right now arguing Bethesda should be working with Mod Authors who have been trying to help fix the game, now if you want to call them a minority, I won't disagree in the least. ;)
---
You look like the kind of person that hasn't read the latest Inside the Vault post.
---
Here, let me help you out:
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/7DVp0EfSlQgspUWrcMzI1O/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-31-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/7DVp0EfSlQgspUWrcMzI1O/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-31-2019)
---
Uh, don't really know what to tell you. The only explosive weapon I have is a level 35 double barrel not even two shot and even after the nerf and not even close to fully specced into it, it is still very strong. I don't really understand what problem you may be having with what you describe, are you basically looking for a build to switch too to continue one-shotting every enemy in the game? Because I think they are making it pretty clear that isn't an intended gameplay mechanic and whatever you possibly do switch too will probably be nerfed soon as well. 
---
5k for all 4 of them. I think I spend around 7k buying them before the known tag lol
---
Thank you. 
---
Giving out a free upgrade to a game is hardly bad business practices.  Hell releasing remastered games isn't even a bad business practice considering there is always the choice of \*not buying it\*.  My point is that they were \*above\* the industry standard.
---
Actually you *didn't* delete that long retort you claimed you didn't write. It's still there. Which is extra funny.
---
This has messed the game up completely!
---
Hey, the Browns won a game earlier in the season, the fans actually have a reason to hope they might win a game again.
---
From what I read it sounded like they plan to buff explosive weapons and leave the legendary effect and perk alone
---
Gotta update that terminology.
---
Places use it now as the "hot" being the work is being done quickly and sent out asap.
---
What bothers me is that you guys are more concerned about the weight and the crafting who cares you guys screwed the game when you adjusted perk cards and two shot damage. Why would you do that I can understand if you cut it in half but by 75% is insane. Go shoot a shot gun without the explosive rounds and tell me what kind of damage it did. 
---
I'm enjoying it. However, I knew nothing of the game until I it came bundled with my Xbox one x. I had no expectations, that's what I suggest.
---
It doesn't really matter what you want to call it, industry standard, 'the bar', 'gold standard', whatever, there is zero excuse to be making a AAA always-online game which expects and experiences regular fixes and content patches and not have a robust version control and QA system in place. MMOs have been doing it for decade(s) now. 
---
For being always online, costing 60$, and expecting microtransactions the bare minimum to expect is to have version control, code audits, and playtesting/QA processes.
---
Burn it down
---
How would one check if they really have no perk cards on though?
---
It's even worse than that. They're not persistent within multiple logins on the same day. So if you get disconnected or log in several times e.g. 2 smaller play session, bye-bye quest.
---
A D20 is not enough sides of crazy.
---
Yea i didn’t really follow that inside the vault too well
---
Not trying to one shot. Just think that there is a better build, and a lot of people have been suggesting good ideas. 
---
havent logged in in a few weeks, to let them sort out some bugs that were bothering me, maybe a couple patches.
---
but holy shit im done with this game now. i would rather go mod FO4 and start a new run. this is pathetic from a AAA developer
---
i never thought i would not be excited for TESVI or a new Fallout. TESV, FO3, FONV are some of my most cherished memories and favorite games, ever. very sad
---
I thought both were reserved for FO76 as a whole.
---
I believe it when I'm spewing hot 5mm from my triple barrel minigun.
---
I guess it counts for  something that you are aware that you are part of the reason why companies can get away with this. Sucker born every minute and all that.
---
But why?
---
Well I'm more of a story guy so I can't be bothered to start my own business in this game where i sell stuff to vendors all day everyday. I just want a better " End game " to this game.
---
Tbh It's a good thing that people still enjoy this game, although I don't really like how things turned out to be It's still a great game besides all the stupid things that the developers do. maybe one day things will be okay idk. 
---
Seriously?
---
Please, the "issue" they're aware of is the fact that we noticed what was happening before they were ready.
---
That’s true. Hoping they balance out all builds soon so that each has an advantage but not one big enough to overpower the others. 
---
Because all of these things don't work.
---
Obviously, you’ve made the choice to not hold out hope for the game to improve with time. That’s your prerogative. I, on the other, don’t see the purpose of never playing the game again after changes and additions have been made due to a bad first impression.
---
no dude damage bug 100% impacted ranged.  
---
I read a theory it's only the sneak damage bonus, or other bonus damage so it might be true that some ranged wasn't impacted but I had the bug on my stealth sniper before, and now it's back.
---
I called that guy out as a liar and this was his response:
---
&gt;Not sure how that qualifies as lying. Read the Bethesda forum, literally any thread. 
---
&gt;You will see more hostile threads remaining open. And being cynical and snarky is not the same thing as "hostile". Sorry you got that mixed up.
---
I don't know if he's a troll or if he's so used to being an asshole that he genuinely thinks his post was civil. And it's irritating seeing r/Fallout just blindly believe him because of their Bethesda hate jerk. There's absolutely issues with the game and with Bethesda itself but spreading false rumors accomplishes nothing.
---
I'm someone else, but in one comment OP said:
---
&gt;[How can I deserve to get banned]... IF IM NOT A DUPER AND NEVER HAVE DONE IT TO KNOW HOW TO NOT REPLICATE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO IT https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alko1s/crafted_a_few_gamma_guns_to_learn_mods_got_banned/efesyzk/
---
but then he says... 
---
&gt;[I] have not duped since someone asked me to do the artillery one long ago and i didnt know what i was doing when they told me to stay in the inventory screen and grab it when they say to. i have picked up bags from raiding dupers but that hasnt happened in about a month, so its unlikely to suspend my account now. familiar with the modus method but i havent done it. https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alko1s/crafted_a_few_gamma_guns_to_learn_mods_got_banned/effbjio/
---
He seems like he's only being half honest. He clearly knows two methods of duping, and has done one of them. How can he also say he has never done it and not know how to do it? 
---
Is is possible he's being banned erroneously? Maybe. Is he being totally honest? No.
---
Like i said there is a difference between *willing to* and actually *achieving it*.
---
Am i *willing to* to build a spaceship ? Absolutely. Will i *achieve it*? Highly doubtful, especially if i don't start looking into how to do it correctly.
---
Joke aside, so far they have given the impression that they want things to get better yes, whether its a genuine sentiment on their part or not, is still always completely eclipsed by the fact that keep breaking something else making the situation worse than before.
---
I hate using this term because it seems to be the go to word for unargumented criticism nowadays for something bad, but they need to stop being *lazy* and half assing their fixing methodology.
---
Spend the time and ressources needed (i don't care what it requires it is not my job to think about it) to **thoroughly** fix bugs. 
---
I have no technical knowledge in the matter when it comes to how to programming but whatever they are doing is obviously wrong.  As we stated in all updates so far. It is wrong in their decision making (nerfing the wrong things) and also in execution ( resurgence of older bugs or new ones). And to top it off, now if i uderstood correctly, removing Equipment previously available in the game to resell them separately? Have they lost their mind?
---
I can only be upset and utterly disappointed at something for so long before im calling quits, and i don't want to but, damn Bethesda or whoever is making calls you are really not helping. 
---
If im still here today is because i want this game to change, to become something it should have been from the get go. I want to forget all the drama this game has been through… I want BGS to prove everyone who has been trash talking 76 for months that you will get the last laught will get the last by making 76 a great game and redeem themselves. Some things can't be excused and shouldn't ever be but for the most part you can if you are acting right.
---
Absolutely **no one** i'm friend with wants to touch this game even with a 10ft pole, i was for a while being constantly made fun of (to put nicely) by a bunch of them just for playing it. Is this the mark the people who have spent time working on this wants to leave in their career resume ? 
---
They still have a chance to fix things but it's been 3months already with no substantial progress, and i dont think we can hold hope for another 3. I certainly can't. If 6months after release the game is still in majority in the same state as it is now ? I will just give up for good. 
---
Sure, on my own I do not matter. But think, when more and more people will start doing the same thing either sooner or after i do, it will be the point of non return for the game and you wont have anyone left to say "Bye felicia" to and Fallout 76 would forever be a remembered as one of the biggest failures in gaming history.
---
Look at no man sky i've never played this game but the game is apparently leagues better than it used to be.
---
Look at FF14 a game i play daily. The 1.0 version was a **total** Failure but guess what? They did the right thing. They did not want the game to be remembered as a Failure, they shut down the game entirely and fully rebuilt it from the ground up. And it is nowadays one of the Top MMOs on the market going in its 3rd expansion this year. 
---
I can't fathom that Bethesda, Zenimax, whoever it is, i do not care, doesn't wan't to be willing to spend maybe a it more now to rebuild the game to earn even more later. It's a win win situation really.
---
Not agreeing with you that Fo76 is game of the year and seeing it for what it is = I’m a troll. Lol what must it be like honestly believing that your opinion trumps all?
---
look into mutations. Adrenal reaction, speed demon, marsupial and twisted muscles are really good in my opinion. Adrenal will up your weapon damage the lower your health. 
---
Btw, this senior AAA dev [thoroughly agrees with you](http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/149466049419/80-20-5)
---
"I’ve often mentioned the general breakdown of games player bases as 80%, 20%, and 5%. 80% of players will never engage with anything beyond the game itself. 20% will actually bother to go online and read something about the game, and **a mere 5% will be engaged so much as to actually bother to post and communicate with other players.**"
---
He goes into it more [here](http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/128047058096/the-masses-the-myth-the-metrics) and also [here](http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/178922081656/youve-mentioned-the-80205-rule-and-i-have-to)
---
How about no. I can hate this game, or any other as much as I want.
---
You're missing an arm, did Bethesda scrap that too?
---
You have been banned from Fallout 76 Fight Club for breaking Rule #1 &amp; #2
---
I'm leaving it installed for the survival mode and if that dissapoints me, then they've finally lost me on this game.
---
Obviously, you’ve made the choice to not hold out hope for the game to improve with time. That’s your prerogative. I, on the other hand, don’t see the purpose of never playing the game again after changes and additions have been made due to a bad first impression.
---
It's in the Whitesprings Resort somewhere, don't recall the specific spot.
---
What are your specs? You may have too many applications flooding your ram and making Fallout 76 harder to run 
---
They are not taking the whole thing offline because 0.0001% of the playerbase is screaming through their monitors for it. They're going to keep chugging along just like they have been, and in a few more months you'll end up with a game close to what you feel like you paid for. If not longer. 
---
At some point you just gotta take stock of a situation. We arent paying a subscription, and there is no DLC on the horizon for them to charge for. They bit off more than they could chew and right now they're hunkering down and licking their wounds. Either deal with the situation rationally and stick through it by positively encouraging the improvement of this game, or just save yourself the damn headache. 
---
How is $60 worth getting this upset over? It's not, its the time you've put into the game expecting it to improve? That's on you, you took the risk of spending all that time in a game knowing it could possibly not improve at the rate you expected it to. All the issues from beta on are just a testament to that, you could not ask for more red flags with a game. I get your frustration, but the time for these words and conviction was 3 months ago, not now. Its just not impressive at this point. The ship has sailed, and it's not going back to port. Get in a life boat, or start plugging holes and get used to having wet feet.

First let me say i never play online. I want to do my own thing and not deal with other players. Was really pissed at first that it was online only. So not only did i buy 76 first day out. But then found out that i had to buy online for my ps4. Let me tell you i was pissed. But let me just say i bought a head set today and i love this freaking game. Yeah its got some issue but the fact that you can put in. As one guy said 760 hrs and your still playing. Thats some bang for your buck. So shut the hell up. Quit playing or enjoy up to you!
---
My apologies for that. Wasn't my intent to mislead. It didn't catch everything I was typing in the title. If no-one has started this it's something I was thinking about starting to do.
---
Some people can't just let go of the fact that Fallout 76 isn't an offline single player RPG.
---
Ah yeah, I was trying to get the info out quick and  didn't notice my phone autocorrecting.  As a former editor I'll leave it up as a badge of shame.
---
Yep I got all the mutations recently. Love them all, thank you 👍🏻
---
Do you do happy endings?
---
What about serendipity? Have they fixed it?
---
Remember when this sub was just 'To the guy who X'd while I was Y'ing'?
---
Yeah, dunno why they had to make those posts either.
---
Baltimore Orioles fan?
---
I wish they would also change as fast as the other balances, the durability and dmg of energy guns.
---
Responder Bot had the two clock plans, clean ranger outfit and a yellow hat (can’t remember name) last night. 
---
See, I appreciate your attitude and thoughtfulness.  It doesn't impact you but you can see how it would annoy others and aren't acting like an asshole.  Good job being you!
---
-_-
---
Of course, a day after posting I was stuck at 9 for months, last night I ran through the gold clubhouse with a friend and *EVERY SINGLE GHOUL* that spawned in was a golfer. He finished the quest in one visit to the club house. 
---
Well better late than never I guess.
---
The fact that they acknowledge that there is still a problem is half the battle. Let's hope the solution is adequately balanced.
---
Or that they don't vet at all.
---
Am I a sucker because I choose to throw some extra money towards my hobby? Why? If it brings me enjoyment then what is the problem? Does it make people that don’t agree with you more palatable if you insult them like this? Seems pretty childish. 
---
Completely the same problem
---
The workshop on the far right of the map in the bog has 3 concrete extractors. Concrete is one of the few things they actually make a decent amount of. You will have 100+ in under an hour and you can do whatever else you want in the meantime. 
---
Your limiting yourself again by thinking you  can’t use this work ethic at Bethesda.
---
Get hired AND work smarter not harder.
---
yup was happening to me yesterday. not sure why. 
---
You'd be dead wrong about them not tracking player data. Every AAA studio has been for the past 10 years at least in incredible depth.
---
Not to mention, the entire point behind FO76 is upgrading the engine for wider and stronger telemetry alongside content services and payments. We're guinea pigs for the framework of all further Bethesda published games.
---
The issue with me is once a game has pissed me off enough to quit I rarely give enough of a fuck to ever start playing again. 
---
They could fix all the bullshit and after I'm fed up I'll congratulate them for fixing things but it's too little too late almost always.
---
If you uninstall the game the only change you will see is Bethesda giving up on this game. I personally don’t want them to despite the problems it has. I still think if can recover. 
---
Y'ALL PAID $60 FOR THIS LMAO
---
Thanks for checking.
---
The PA requirement for the accuracy bonus (that is absolutely a requirement if you wanna use a 50 cal or minigun or any analog) pisses me off a bit, I built around a no power armor tank build and now I've got to choose whether I wanna be a heavy or a tank in any session.
---
I automatically drop any energy weapons I find.  Useless extra weight
---
Yep. Lost a few SB and a whole pack of glowies to that already.
---
That's rich? You can afford a console but not a little extra? Not even eventually? Bro, get real lol.
---
Ok, well yeah melee would probably be stronger and a select few other gun builds under the right conditions. I just imagine you are already one shotting everything with your current build considering I am myself still except for the stronger high level enemies with my build. I am actually an auto rifle build with a +30% shotgun damage, 2 points enforcer and 3 points demolition and my explosive double barrel still wrecks everything. When it comes to scorchbeasts I use my auto combat rifle and handmade and take them down fairly quick.
---
I could use it somewhere else, be less stressed, and achieve the same results.
---
Another 50 year old besides me plays Fallout76?  
---
I bet I can kick your ass in Atari Tanks. 
---
I tried changing it from ultra to low and it didn't make a difference.
---
I wrote it I had bad service I discarded post your douche ass keeps bringing it up. Oh it's so funny lol. I like trying to get under people's skin. I'm a internet edge lord. Everyone look at me I'm important. Hehe I love Mario Kart hehe. Awe... Bless your heart... 
---
Is that enough explanation 
---
I like to troll other subs hehe. am I getting all this right? I feign giving a crap  I like some of the stories. And try to find new stuff to do.  But truthfully and deeply I don't give a shit in my heart of hearts... 
---
So is that a better response?  Or should I stick to Yup... 
---
No don't you get it? Bethesda killed your dog, poisoned Flint's water supply, caused Brexit, and bombed Pearl Harbor. They're clearly the evilest company on the planet.
---
I kept trying to get my friends to get it, even up until a couple of weeks ago because they were tired of all their games. I still enjoyed it up until patch 5, but I rage quit this morning because the game kept freezing and I couldn't do anything. Pull up the pipboy, freeze. Pull up the map, freeze. Reload my gun, freeze. Try to join a world, freeze. I never experienced any of the game breaking bugs everybody was bitching about until patch 5. My best friend finally got the game thanks to game share on Xbox, but I now feel like he paid too much
---
Isn’t he the one in Grafton past the train station around the bus on the left 
---
Super strange, mine doesn't go down at all. I have wood and steel on me that weighs .05, instead of .01.
---
Read through this thread.  There are a couple saying this was "what we wanted".  That's Bethesda level mental gymnastics.
---
Unfortunately you are only one person. Thanks I guess? Lol. My point still stands. Most probably don’t care.
---
Yeah but what decent damage I see people crying that their 1300 damage tse now only does 600
---
Since when did giving away stimpacks ruin anybodies fun?
---
Bro my mom bought my Xbox and i spent my 2k yearly allowance already on fortnite
---
Whining about people whining I’m against that let’s just be decent and express our disdain together 
---
hahahahaha Kick to Fix - Trademark Bethesda =)
---
Or more likely they wanted to try maximise profits for the remaster. They're not the only devs to limit access to a game that gets remastered but it still feels very shitty to hold out on back compatible approval to try and milk the audience further.
---
I asked mom to help when I broke both my arms.
---
Not gonna speak for the guy you replied to, but I don't give a shit about the outfit when I've got a very good set of armor. Multiple pieces with AGI or PER, a chameleon piece, a cloaking piece, two +stealth pieces, two food and chem weight reduction pieces, two junk weight reduction pieces and a weapon weight reduction piece. Not to mention the two sleek mods, two deep pocketed mods and a shadowed mod.
---
All of those add up to a very well balanced stealth sniper build, having to use a rad suit or power armor and lose all of those buffs in a nuke zone really, really sucks. I mean, just the inventory mods alone make it so much less frustrating to play, in a rad suit, I'll become over encumbered just by looting the queen and like two other scorched mobs, with my armor on I can clear all of West-tec and have space leftover. And as a stealth character I've built my build around the chameleon effect, I have the mutation also, but the hazmat suit counts as armor for the mutation so I'm screwed there as well.
---
So until Bethesda does something about it, I'll be staying clear of nuke zones unless I need to bite the bullet to go on a flux farming run, especially since they nerf/fixed the diluted rad-x stacking.
---
Oh and yeah, I agree with the hunter's longcoat, looks badass, of course anything looks better than the godawful hazmat suit (though the yellow prototype one is better) or a suit of power armor. In closing, I'll echo the poster above: Bethesda pls.
---
I wish I could upvote this a million times.
---
Is this just fantasy?
---
You spend any time playing MMORPGs and it’s the law of the land.  They’ll still be making adjustments two years down the road and we’ll see the same reaction then as now.  You can rage quit or learn that the next big MMO is going to pop you a few times before things are decently there, and even then there will still be complaints about X is OP!  I’ve long ago learned to ignore it.  
---
I’ve stopped being a min/max builder and just do what I want.  Which is really what 80% or more of players do anyway.  They Forest Gump through the game hoping to be super heroes.   God love ‘em.
---
this makes me feel a bit better about it
---
I have to give it to their community team here on reddit.  They do try to respond regularly and I've rarely seen a company as active as they are on here regarding this game.
---
However, their development team obviously just watches porn all day.  Would you want to go interrupt that over this bug?
---
“ if people have been hoarding mininukes to trade, then that scarcity is gone...”
---
No, I’m not forgetting. You said hoarding. They ARE rare in the world; people who don’t use them and are hoarding them have been collecting for a long time. If they suddenly get powerful and in demand, that hoarded stash will be run through pretty quickly and the collection rate from the world drop would not replenish them very fast. People would move to crafting them, and would have to charge appropriately if they were crafting to sell. 
---
Basic economics. 
---
Shame your getting down voted, we need to cull some of these people
---
I'm glad I avoided this completely. 
---
I would have loved to just see a standard Fallout game with co-op. He'll, release DLC for FO4 with co-op.
---
But FO76 is just something I never wanted and I doubt the majority did either.
---
That all may be true. But unlike most people on this sub who say they're quitting because Bethesda pissed them off too bad, ill be sticking to my guns and not supporting the company that butchered my favorite game  to prop up a different one. Anthem is the game that killed mass effect andromeda. Mass effect 3 was my favorite game. Andromeda flopped. I dont forgive that easily and my wallet is my voice.
---
Thank you. Whenever I look at the top posts on this sub, I dont understand them. I've been playing since the beta, taking my time, and I just hit level 45 yesterday and am still having a blast. I cant understand how people have sunk so many hours into this game in such a sort time and expect to still like it the same. Getting burnt out is a real thing and it seems that a lot of people forget about that.
---
well that's a start.  Good to know I'm not the only one
---
Caught in a landslide. No escape from Bethesda Game Studios.
---
Great, now I'm constantly in \[CAUTION\] while sneaking, and I think my fusion cores are depleting faster (could be wrong on this point, as it's much more subjective).
---
How dare you, I don't have a heart.
---
Lmao best joke post in this thread, thanks for the laugh
---
Drop a pin on grafton just above the top of the icon for the city, right there-ish!
---
I had a problem like this all of a sudden too man. I can try and help you out with what I did to fix it. Can you tell me do you have an nvidia graphics card?
---
OP just wants that counter-circle jerk, white knight karma
---
Fair point but, it was not intended or they would have said that in the notes.  Also, some people hold their hulks because of the perks lowering their weight and not affecting stash boxes.  I can hold my bulk and store more actual items in my stash than if I did it the other way around.
---
Try turning down render distance, or open task manager and close some background processes 
---
&gt; Or more likely they wanted to try maximise profits for the remaster. '
---
Then why was it given away free for PC users?
---
Great game ? Best fallout game ? Fuck are your standards low 
---
You’re like those creatures at the bottom of the sea that will just eat shit and more shit without a thought.  
---
This is what’s wrong with the industry there has to be less of you people and more people with standards so gaming can be great as it once was. 
---
Btw fallout new Vegas , fallout 3 , even fuckin fallout 4. And u chose this as the best fallout game you ever played ? 
---
There’s always that one dude lol. 
---
i am new here and hope to farm some karma here. please give me +1.
---
i will save a kitten for each +1from my local rescue center
---
Why do people bulk all their junk when most of it just gets heavier anyway?  I don't understand this part.
---
Thank you for the advice. Everyone is also saying that other builds will probably be nerfed or balanced as well, so you’re right saying my best bet would probably be sticking with shotguns. 
---
9 year old too high 
---
is this a bug or intended?
---
[I bet it’s Allan. ](https://i.imgur.com/ivEt0Ec.jpg) 
---
Good catch.  Yeah, character inventory only.
---
Dude you’re so wrong lmao 
---
I'm not sure, how do you check?
---
You're right, i've changed the receiver and now the guerrilla perk works. 
---
Thank you 
---
Nothings open in the background, so it's not that.
---
Yes. This and 7/10 named legendaries I killed today dropped no legendary at all. Waiting til health regened did not help. One was even glowing with 3 stars and it dropped one piece of chalk. 
---
Hindsight *is* 20/20
---
Also anyone who created a character in beta and continued using it after release doesn't get the trophies for things they did in beta. Bethesda tweeted about it at launch. 
---
That would further skew the ps4 numbers. 
---
Id also be careful about generalizing for the entire population based on ps4 numbers only. PC gamers tend to play games in a substantially different way to console gamers. 
---
it may have something to do with rad worms. If I find more info ill def let you know
---
What’s crazy to me is that it’s viable to be more tanky in legendary armor than PA. 
---
I loved playing this game but come on dude lol. This current state of the game and the constant messes are really a joke from one of the biggest gaming names out there, satellite studio or not. I get being tired of the people whining about it but where else are they supposed to go. I also think you're really lying to yourself if you think the people talking here aren't likely the most active people in the game. 
---
The true endgame of course; All the photomode \^\^ 
---
Yeah well the halo engin can keep up with current requirements it seems... 
---
I understand you like the game and sure some people will like it... But objectively it's bad. Even if some of the game concepts have potential the execution is just not there.
---
Destiny 2 might be a polished turd but F76 is just a turd.
---
Doesnt matter, sometimes there is background processes running without you knowing 
---
No problem. You should still be putting out some pretty damn good damage. Can you maybe elaborate more on what exactly you want the build to be good at? Like what specific enemies you are trying to kill?
---
600 would be decent damage. More like 300 is about the cap for almost all the tse guns now. But that’s only the top tier guns being the tse. Those are the only ones that do any damage at all. Regular legendary guns are left in the dark doing little to comparable at all. Guns are guns. They should do heavy damage compared to melee. Definitely when it comes to the tse ones. Specially when they require so much more time and upkeep than any melee weapon.  I’m not crying about the reasons they nerfed all ranged guns but they obviously way over did it. It’s just redundant. 
---
That would break my tradition of trying the game once every patch to see how long it takes to disconnect me.  Last patch I got 30 minutes! 
---
Force of habit for me, I think. Mainly so I can keep a general idea of how much I'll have available to sell, but also so I don't have to try and remember which non bulked items you can actually sell :p
---
Replying to myself to confirm as of right now, they are refreshing faster than 24-hours. I have a Responder vendor that refreshed after 21 hours right now. I'll expand here further if I see an earlier time.
---
Yeah, good to see there is still people out there that have really low standards of quality. Keep up the good work supporting a development team so incompetent, they can't even manage to check their own version of the game before they patch it!
---
Browns?
---
While I agree that the ban is justified on a support review of the circumstances at the very least, I disagree with the lack of response within the self-imposed time period and the disabling of other purchased games. This ban should have been limited solely to the 76 license on the account, if he were to have gotten out of hand with support then I could see a total account ban but based on the email, I don't see that at least as presented.
---
I realize they have a lot going wrong with 76 and duplication is a major factor in that due to the effect on the economy but it shouldn't lead to an overzealousness to deploy the account ban across the platform unless evidence indicates the behavior is percolating through other properties or, they can tie the obtaining of those properties directly to duplication abuse in 76. An example I can think of offhand is a sting operation in which the subject directly transferred duplicated items upon completion of a real world transaction which isn't as far-fetched as it may sound given the pittance the items go for by their very nature.
---
Yeap maybe u are right, maybe numbers would be a way of showing how bad some weapons are.. someone today posted about the LMG. At first I didn’t even know what gun it was. That weapon is so bad it made me forget about it. 
---
I’m glad I could help.  It’s a good game with a good community.  It will be having growing pains for awhile, but be patient and just play.  There was so much good in this last patch, it by far outweighs a nerf and a few pins...the latter they’ve already fixed.
---
I guess easiest way would be too right click on your desktop and see if you have options for an nvidia control panel or AMD radeon.
---
IMO, there shouldn't be a difference between Boiled and Purified, especially when recipes are currently incompatible with the latter.
---
Well that's why I want the no PA build at all, because with the right perks for natural armor you can get PA level defense AND have all those bonuses.  
---
Well since you said that I bought em, dont even want em but someone might lol
---
Yeah man, just can't enjoy a game as long as someone else dislikes it
---
Lmao spot on.
---
I assumed it would be creation club only. 
---
It’s isn’t just hard, it impossible right now. For anyone.
---
I guess at least give us the option to make clean soup that didn't cause rads
---
I have the same issue on PS4, most common with Scorched at close range with ranged weapons (95%)
---
Scaling isn't the solution - scaling is the problem.
---
Hypothetical: energy weapons scale off INT. Person A is fully spec'd for energy weapons. Person B is spec'd for melee and has 1 INT. Both have a laser rifle.
---
Person A and B both have a laser rifle. Person A decides 'this is my main weapon', whereas Person B decides 'this is the weapon I will use to damage enemies as they close'.
---
Which person do you balance around?
---
Balance around Person A and you have laser rifles being totally useless unless you dump a humongous number of points into them. Balance around Person B and you have energy weapons being OP as balls for a spec'd build, to the point where - why should you use anything else? Balancing it to the midway point is smart - but that falls apart because the gap between A and B is so large that it's still either OP or underpowered.
---
The state of melee atm is that it's balanced around Person B, so that any schmuck can do decent damage with a melee weapon. But because Person A does _so much more damage_ than Person A, it's OP in the hands of person A.
---
STR scaling should be removed from melee, and all melee weapons should deal as much base damage as a current character with 15 STR.
---
Energy weapons should not be made to scale off INT - they should be buffed, plain and simple.
---

There were at least inklings of it that I loved a ton in oblivion. Running into Quill-Weave in Chorrol randomly because she heads there every month for a book club. Or one of the sleeper agents for the Mythic Dawn in the Imperial City taking a trip every month to visit another Sleeper in Chorrol pub to meet.
---
Best part is that if you visit the house of the Chorrol dude, you find bodies in the basement.
---
I have different opinions than you. Big fuckin deal.
---
Whats more important: nerfing a few trolls who can also be killed with explosive weapons? Or screwing everyone over that worked very hard to get tse weapons only for them to be useless. 
---
how about a fizzle fix, since every time they do it they break more things, sometimes the very things they were trying to fix.
---
469 hours, level 127.
---
I just want them to not reimplement a shitton of bugs that they already fixed 
---
The ugly yellow bucket looking hat?
---
No idea what you are talking about but I recommend a therapist.
---
Detroiter logging in, this is our mentality for the last xx years. Yup.. good stuff
---
Yep
---
Sometimes you gotta try multiple times at completely different spots to make it work. 
---
You can get better than PA defenses and stat bonuses and that pisses me off. PvE its fine and dandy but PA in PvP is garbage. 
---
I don’t want to be impressive or anything, I just want to understand why such people I described still exist. And you are totally right, Iam actually impressed by the rationality of your comment... bc, again, you’re right. The thing is: I just trusted them. I didn’t want to see all the red flags, bc I wanted it to be a good game from start on and I mean, not everything was/is bad, of course not. With one thing I disagree though: it is quite the majority of the playerbase „screaming“, definitely not the minority. And too late? The opposite for me. I gave them time, even in the beginning, I defended the game, had trust in them even when the same if not more glitches appeared with every patch... but yeah, I just wanted to let some anger out finally. And every time I complain about it online is wasted time, with that you’re right... oh and another thing which I find a bit concerning: 60$ for that is fine for you? And I shouldn’t be bothered? Well, Iam not that rich and don’t buy a new game every month. Last thing I bought before 76 was cod wwll, before that the Witcher wild hunt. With fallout 4 and 76 I purchased 4 games the last 4 years, rest I loaned. So it is a big deal for me and for many other too. 
---
What in the actual fuck...
---
Your experience disregards anyone who has played more than you, who disagrees with you, the companies that get paid to review games for a living, and the majority of Reddit posters.
---
Liking a game doesn’t make it a good game, and it doesn’t mean the company did a good job. 
---
I like fallout76, because I’m a fan of prior fallout games and the world built in those games.  The only objective reason I can believe that I enjoy it is because of nostalgia and hope that they will do a better job in the future.
---
Read the reviews.  Open YouTube.  Watch twitch streamers.  Check their social media.  Read the forums.
---
The truth is: this game is not good, and it is not great.  It could be, but this game is a revenue bridge until a future release of TES, Fallout 5 and Starfield. 
---
[Objective Reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76) 
---
The wiki was edited after 76's release. Prior to that there was no indication of BoS anywhere else than around lost hills so soon after the war. 
---
PC audience is notoriously hard to shovel shit into and PC could get a better experience with mods anyway so the remaster wouldn't benefit much so they'd have to delist the original to drive sales and how do you imagine that'd fly? Also is there any remaster sharing a digital storefront with the original?
---
You seem like the perfect person to answer your question . do some testing
---
Melee have to run into damage....range can keep their distance, I think people are forgetting that like I said I use a 200ish damage weapon
---
outdated perk card manager, and show damage will also result in a CTD.
---
Damn, I so want in on this! I'm level 56 and have never once run in to Grahm.  
---
Every update they nerf things and still havent fixed basic perks, so I would safely say no. Stay away for a few more months, honestly.
---
Just wait a bit same happens to me i just wait 
---
Honestly, the community was pretty mixed, leaning towards the negative as of the past month from what I could tell. Yet I still saw plenty of top rated gilded posts that swung in both directions. 
---
My concern was for the people who *were* able to formulate a decent argument for why they like the game, even while acknowledging its flaws, who still got absurd amounts of abuse just because their opinion leaned positive. 
---
By all means - don't let up on developers if there's something wrong with the product you purchased. But when we start making it so that "rage" is the *sole* opinion anyone is allowed to have when it comes to a game.....that's a little disturbing from a social perspective. 
---
I definitely see the bad decisions. And am actually pretty baffled by them, especially from a company who's been at least okay until now. But I simply can't sit on the side of the people who just want to sit there and froth and nothing else.
---
Hmm, if you could get an anti-armor explosive shotgun I bet that would work really good for you, especially against scorchbeasts. Not even positive those two modifiers can be found together though haha.
---
You've been a programmer 15 years and have never heard of gitflow?

Bruh RDR2 is the only game I’ve ever seen on Xbox be over 100GB with our DLC. You can fit more than 5 games on 500GB and an external hard drive is not really expensive
---
I'VE BEEN PLAYING SINCE ARENA
---
It’s posts like this that do nothing for the argument. You don’t need to post “numbers” when you have page after page after page on the reddit complaining about this. It’s fairly obvious people are upset, we’d like you to contribute something. 
---
As much as I hate EA and Activision, I at least know I'm not getting a completely broken game for $60. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahvtb0/you_dont_need_any_good_weapons_to_kill_everything/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Still doubt?
---
I honestly think that the nerf was necessary, but not as much as it was. The current nerf really screwed everyone over who built up their character for tse weapons only for it to be reduced to nothing. And i really feel bad for the people that paid money, REAL MONEY, on these and i see it as a scam to rop people of what they have workes so hard for.
---
I shall do tonight.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable.
---
Make better choices next time.
---
Same here...... ugh! 
---
I mean, a lot of the negativity from youtubers are a bit overblown. If you just try to enjoy FO76 as a MMO-lite using the Fallout brand, then the game isn't that awful. It's just about as buggy as other Bethesda games (which I feel that most BSW fans already accept). The game still has its merits as a fun exploration-based game. 
---
But after a while, the charm of the game really wears off. I pretty much quit when I crashed out of 10 sessions over a period of a couple hours due to bugs. Came here and posted the issues that made me finally give up on this game and the fanboys pretty much attacked me over it. 
---
Browns beat the Bengals both times this year and badly at that. You know Hue Jackson has the distinction of coaching two different teams into the AFC North Division into last place in the same season. 
---
weirdest skeleton is at Charleston train station in the trash can by the bathroom
---
I agree, and don’t think devs are testing what they are balancing, neither they are going by numbers. If they do it would show even better how bad some weapons currently are.
---
Interesting... Thank you for clarifying
---
I think i got the same one as you ;)
---
Is that rare? Swear I've seen it somewhere else?
---
But anyway grahm only had heavy combat legs everything else was regular old crap every vendor is selling now. Wasnt sure if they still had unique items since the patch. I posted on r/fo76, marketplace and bazaar and held him for 15 mins and noone showed so I figured maybe nothing unique anymore
---
Not sure either, regardless I really appreciate your help man, been kinda clueless on what to do since the patch. 
---
&gt;  Hours of my life wasted on trying to get that powerful gun so I can finally be able to kill high level enemies.  
---
Except that you don't need a TSE to kill high level enemies.   You need them to one shot kill high level enemies.  There's a difference.
---
Good post, accurate, nothing to add to it.
---
76 was not unplayable at launch lol. I've played since beta and played 8 hours straight on launch day. 
---
Yeah, it's not best route. But No Mans sky did turn out to be a good game after some time. I'd definitely like to see some real new content in the next month or so. 
---
Melee seems to be the only viable build lately
---
Lol, how about a 40 year old?
---
Known bug, I'm sure they'll fix it in the next patch.
---
I joke. Just click on the sub.
---
I am caught in the middle.  I didn’t join the game at launch but did so later and have grinded my way to close to 100lvl.  I love the franchise and was so jazzed for this latest installment, bugs and all. 
---
What I don’t care for are the arrogant a-holes that preach and talk down to others because of their level or status.  Guess what - I paid $60 just like tbe level 200 or the newbies so who are we or you to judge?  
---
I just want a decent game experience.  Not much to ask.  
---
Is that the one where two don't have clothes and two do?
---
On point.
---
How do you get 91 dmg?
---
My two shot 50 cal. barely reaches 75.
---
Yeah I play with 3 rl friends 2 or 3 nights a weeks, outside of the occasional bug we've had alot of fun, all lvl 70-100 now.
---
I mean our biggest complaint was always the half rendered team mate bug that looks to be fixed :)
---
With Anthem coming out we'll be splitting time, but hopefully some DLC and vault openings will pull us between games some.

Coolio

The building in Grafton has a sign outside with the responder (heart) logo and "Trading Post"; Greg hangs out usually on the ground floor, through the open archways. Not to be confused with the vendor in the Grafton train station.
---
I know some of those words.
---
I also know that Browns fans get super butthurt if other people even imply that their team isn't great.
---
Some of these bulk items, they don’t exist in game(yet) correct? Like bulk circuits and crystal? 
---
Keep coming out of sneak mode with a legendary level 25 chameleon right arm piece only to still be invisible.
---
I like upstream of the mutant behemoth pond. It’s pretty and you knee cap the behemoth once he is in range of your bases turrets for easy xp and loot.
---
Ammo is expensive in this game and when i have to spend so mutch just to take down 1 enemy it gets frustrating 
---
I just imagine all the bosses leave the game to B.Austin for 3 months and when they come back to check up and see the state of the game they'll just be like "HOLY F\*CK WHAT DID YOU DO?!" 
---
Lol cant recall if they were dressed
---
whats with all the voting places anyway?  theyre like obsessed with voting. seems to be in every location lol.

South of the savage above the bear on the map

There's plenty of lakes and rivers south east of the top of the world.

Down by the twin lakes west of huntersville isn't bad either

Man this FO76 sub is losing its collective mind. It's like watching The Joker stream gameplays from Arkham. Hell that might be highly entertaining. 
---
Quick cosplay as The Joker and stream us a FO76 play session. I'll watch it for sure!
---
10 years? Nah man I just can’t see it happening unless they start adding better content than a PvP mode. They need to add more PvE content for sure.
---
Camp mclintock for fatigues, grab the voucher out of the bunk barracks and go to the main building to the uniform dispenser. Itll also prompt a quest. Make sure you pick up the 30 something battered clipboards there also to scrap for springs
---
Fix how?
---
If you mean nerfed then no.
---
Fatigues are at Camp McClintock. Combat armor is level 25 minimum, I believe. The helmet should be available there, as well. 
---
I stopped playing mass effect after the second one for no reason I can remember. Life just got in the way. I look forward to playing the new content that comes out in fallout 76, and I still think it’s a great game. I just haven’t been a part of a successful scorchbeast Queen battle in a couple weeks so I’m frustrated and taking a break. 
---
Perfectly understandable for you to be upset and you’re obviously free to make your own choices for your own reasons. However, are you not curious to see what all that talent went and worked on for so long and put so much effort into? 
---
I got you
---
Sometimes I wander around looking for a cool place to put a camp. There’s so many cool places off the beaten path with all kinds of Easter eggs. 
---
I also have a circuit that I run looking for legendaries and collecting weapons for vendor trash while I wait for my favorite events to pop. Or hit my farming places for lead/steel/springs
---
When my friends are on we mindlessly slaughter places while hanging out. 
---
This game is how I de-stress. I have two 100+ characters and an 80. I don’t need Bethesda to tell me how to have fun in their sandbox, I make my own castles. 
---
I mean, their head isn't their weak point, so yeah.
---
Here's a hint. It's called a water purifier. Instead of giving purified water straight out we should be able to use it to convert other types 
---
It’s a pretty far stretch to think that all of the subs to this subreddit each represent a member of the fo76 population.  I doubt even a tenth of the subs to this subreddit are even semi-active in the game.
---
I tested it on some watogan lvl 50 bots but the results were kinda weird. 
---
The number of bullets required to kill a bot (without adrenaline, tenderizer and psycho buff):
---
Two shot: 10 8 13 9
---
AA: 14 10 8 9
---
I don't believe they do almost exactly the same damage
---
Yes melee does have to run in to the fight and should do decent damage. I get that but it just logically doesn’t make any since. They take the damage output away from the only guns that could compare to the damage output a melee weapon does, and most of the game while exploring is indoors so when it comes down to it you can’t even defend yourself with a machine gun anymore when a whole group of them Attack you. That’s nuts. Especially with how fast the guns break now that you have to pump 60 rounds into a super mutant to drop them. Guns are dead for anyone who uses them as a full time build and doesn’t run many melee weapons. Your absolutely screwed when you enter a building to scavenge now. Especially since players have to do twice the amount of grinding for the supplies to make ammo 
---
Just keep on trucking on. Your build/weapons are still very strong. Give it a little time and people will figure out the new meta, if it isn't still TSE that is. Melee is the most damage for now but with how likely it is to be nerfed it is a dangerous game if you want to waste time switching, plus you will be using melee which for me at least isn't worth it no matter how strong it is.
---
i didnt say skyrim was bad practice, quite the opposite i thought it was one of the best business practices bethesda have done (until you realise they only gave it for free to adjust the backlash from paid mods once again but thats a different conversation)
---
IMO the last of us is an example of not necessarily a bad business practice but just not consumer friendly. i say this because im sure a ton of people did want it remastered strictly for ps4, so the market was there for it.
---
If your opinion is that since you have the choice of not buying something nothing can be a bad business practice then we're done talking here.
---
Lolz
---
bethesda never changes
---
Military fatigues yes a military camp above the fox pic on the map camp something you need to be at least 25 to use combat armor 
---
I’d suggest heading to camp Mcclintok east of flatwoods.  It’s not too dangerous of a trip if you stay on the roadways, and once there it is a safe place to hang out and search.
---
Again, it’s been less than 3 months. If you expected there to already be more content added, then you set yourself up to be disappointed and obviously have very little experience with these types of games. 
---
And I personally just haven’t experienced nearly the amount of “game-breaking” bugs that are out there, so it just all seems a little overblown. It’s got your standard Bethesda crashing problems and weird glitches, but no more than normal IMO. 
---
I wholeheartedly agree that Bethesda shit the bed with their response to all the preorder and launch problems, but I don’t think the game itself is in some shitty spot like a lot of folks on the sub. The experience of the tiny, tiny minority that plowed through all the content and more than likely have more than one character (and a big portion of these cheated to get there) that are now stuck at the end and getting the much-deserved nerd bat just doesn’t concern me at all. 
---
The trajectory Bethesda has taken from 3 to 4 to 76 just shows wall to wall hubris without a true understanding of what makes Fallout so appealing in the first place. It's fine if people are enjoying 76, but they surely can see that what they have would have been so much greater in more caring hands.
---
God that’s funny lol. 
---
It's really not though.  Getting a tank build requires you to stack strength and agility, and while there's lot of good perks in those categories you are going to sacrifice something somewhere else to get that many points in those stats.  
---
Power armor requires no investment.  Find a suit and go to town.
---
Too difficult to Bethesda. They just learned version control yesterday.
---
Here you go

---
I gave up hope too... you simply can’t get behind this. It’s insane 
---
I guarantee that it has nothing to do with the patch.  It has been there from day 1.
---
You can't compare Ultima online with fo76 though.
---
Ultima online was made in 1998 and had a huge persistant world filled with hundreds of players, with player housing where you could customize your house, drop or stack items all over, quest for NPC's, fight different bosses, form factions etc etc
---
It's not a fair comparison.
---
Details are scant, from the way I understood the information, the Atom shop team is just separate. I don't there ever were any transfers or anything that might have denigrated the effectiveness of the main dev team. I think there were just two separate teams with different jobs from inception. 
---
aa is slightly better.
---
I dont want text chat (unless its with Terminals for everyone in same server). I want Area VOIP + Team VOIP. 
---
Either way, you play a game you didn't pay for, on purpose. It's stealing. 
---
I believe I said everything you did by telling everyone to stop whining.  But good job anyway.
---
Anyone else tired of vendors cap amount being too low?
---
Yeah I don’t believe they are testing what they are balancing at least not to the point your average daily player would if they were setup for the task. It’s just a job for them. But for most of there supporting community we don’t stop playing a game until we are bored with it or they release a new sequel to the game everyone’s been waiting for. I still stand by the fact the community needs it’s own test server so our feedback can’t be heard before they just throw updates out to all systems and versions of the game 
---
If you do it too fast, maybe.
---
Hi! Just wondering if the issue with grouping is a known issue? I can't group with friends after being logged in for a few minutes. We have to both log out completely, and then either group from the main menu or group immediately after logging in. Otherwise we just never get the group invites. 
---
How Bethesda has fallen. 
---
Sorry! Complaining is always allowed though. ;) The secret is to just complain for the sake of it regardless of justification. That's how legends are born. 
---
maybe I should do like 5 an hour then
---
Boiled water is MUCH easier to get. Spam collect on any water source and then spam "cook" it into boiled. Sure it costs some wood, but its not like that shit is rare either.

Came from Google
---
&gt; New content needs to come out, for sure. But to be screaming for it after 2.5 months 
---
Had to stop right here. It seems like you didn't pay attention to any discussion on here at all.
---
Come back here in a few months when you've seen the glaring technical and game design issues the people ahead of you have seen already.
---
It's not about new content at all, it's about a working product.
---
&gt; EDIT: Just googled this, Fallout 4 came out Nov 10th, 2015. First DLC  was March 2016 (Automatron) the first REAL game expansion, Far Harbor,  was in May. FO76 is in no way behind schedule for content update  compared to the previous game. 
---
By treating an online game like previous offline sandboxes you're repeating one of the core mistakes bethesda does currently.
---
What this shows is a lack of foresight at best, and a lack of proper documentation on the code at worst.
---
&gt; As a convenience the crafting system will even auto-scrap your bulked items
---
* We don't want to auto-scrap components
---
&gt; We have re-worked the crafting system so it no longer auto-scraps you components for ingredients
---
* Now it won't auto-scrap out bulk items
---
&gt; We have reworked the auto-scraping routine to auto-scrap your bulk items once again
---
* Now it scraps our bulk items when we select "scrap all"
---
Want to know the easy way to fix this? Instead of Bathsheda setting rules for what what will scrap or not (or be fed into the food processor, or sold to the trader, or traded to another player), let us "lock" items in our inventory so they don't scrap - like every other RPG does....
---
heh, thanx!
---
it is just game of give and take.  as some one said above, have to watch the turrets as they take soooooo much budget.  the only reason i have those 2 is because when i am gone, super mutants, scorched and occasionally robots, attack my base.  you can not see them, but i got 4 corn / tato / mutfruit growing.  had a lot more, but building budget limited me.
---
last night i picked up the metal building set and spent several hours rebuilding my camp.....
---
[https://ibb.co/f87F1QH](https://ibb.co/f87F1QH)
---
the problem i am having is now i have no budget left.  not even 1 pixel of empty budget is available!!  ha ha!  so the interior is a bit bare.  just the essentials.  crafting stations, bed, standup bass, a few floor decorations.  this is why we need a budget increase.  i do not need to expand my CAMP, but i sure could use some more budget to decorate the interior.
---
soooooo many ideas.........no budget to implement them.  
---
since the PvP'ers are getting their own servers, us CAMP builders should get some thing similar.  like a sort of dev room that lets us build a complete CAMP, unhindered, blue print it, THEN build it in the world. 
---
another thing that needs fixing in fo76 is the ability to demolish my own CAMP.  i have tried blueprinting the CAMP, then scrapping the blueprint, but that does not always work.  even more tedious is disassembling it piece by piece.  there has GOT to be a better way!! lmao
---
I believe it's one of those things like the pronunciation of GIF. It started as Jif, as in Jiffy Peanut Butter, but after many years of people not in the know reading the word it has changed to officially be hard G GIF.
---
Hotfix, hot swap, the hot means the system is up. However, the meaning has changed to mean something different, and that is the currently accepted meaning.
---
Language evolves, and while I agree with you that strictly speaking, a hotdix should not require downtime, the current understanding has nothing to do with downtime but with the nature of the patch and the speed with which it is implemented. 
---
Never said they should've given out the remaster for free just said they should've allowed back compatibility.
---
Don't think it's greedy to charge for a remaster.
---
Dark Souls is a good shout
---
What a load of nonsense.  Not being able to one-shot kill everything doesn't make it useless. 
---
The crybabies wailing about the TSE nerf are just not being honest. 
---
It now  takes 2-3 shots whereas it used to take just one.   They're sill way more powerful than regular weapons against high level enemies. 
---
This video shows what it's like after the nerf.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpY7EoJQp6c&amp;t=723s
---
It's based on where you are standing and looking. Stand next to gas price sign, and look at red rocket sign. Once I did this, ones that weren't counting before worked. 
---
Even as a player who, on an OCD-like basis, sells all junk items over a quantity of 150 absolute max, I find myself having to clear my stash and sell everything I don't need or won't need later in game on a daily basis (in-game, I don't play every day). I use that 1400 cap limit at least every other play day.
---
The stash limit is too small. Save a few higher-level items you know you'll need down the road, combined with junk mats that you know you need, and you're maxed fairly quickly.
---
but two shot screwed accuracy. 
---
Uh tse was abused not the perks.
---
I ran with just 5pts of demo and my damage went up 300%. 
---
That's wrong.
---
Ever if 5pts gave 100% its wrong as 9pts only give 60%
---
Just downloaded the new patch but I have a new glitch with ghouls (so far I have only encountered scorched and ghouls since the patch) in the allegheney asylum. When I kill them the bodies disappear and reappear at their original spawn position and I can't search them.  
---
I've also had a problem  for a while when I log in or if I change servers (which happens automaticall if you 'join' a friend who is online) it unequipps one of my fast equp weapons so when I press left on the D-Pad it equips fists and not the weapon I' would normally have equipped.  
---
Thirs problem is related to missing items in camp. If I move my camp some of the items I have built are gone. They are not in my storage. They can't have been destoyed because I always have my doors and shutters locked and I'm pretty sure creqtures can't unlock doors, and none of my walls or doors are gone, but items inside my shack are missing.  
---
Lastly, a question regarding budget. Are there any plans to increse camp budget??  It would be nice to be able to build a nicer place with some of the cool decorations AND be able to have a decnt amount of turrets and food growing. There just isn't enough budget to make use of enough of the options available for building. Why have so many options if you can only use a small portion of them at once??
---
On PS4

It is definitely rad worms causing it.  The fix for it introduced a new glitch.  Instead of increasing incoming rad damage by 50%, rad worms increases Everything under effects and aid by 50%.  Hunger and thirst meter restoring, mutation effects, positive and negative, all aid, passive buffs from food and chems, healing from food and chems.  Magazine boosts, bobble head boosts.
---
So stealth isnt fixed? When will it be fixed? One month from now??
---
Bethesda are in too deep to give up now.
---
me too love ps3
---
Not every vendor has a stash box right next to it. And if you run the vendor route in the best possible way, aka the cheapest in terms of fast travelling, there's no stash box in Harpers Ferry and none in the Enclave bunker.
---
The bobby pins weight the correct amount, they just didnt have it set to display the correct number of decimal places. It was like that when they fixed it the first time
---
I feel like they will.  It's only been a few months, and if they did it right now what are the chances it would be perfect?  And then they would be lit up for not fixing what they had already put out before adding more issues right?  But, agree 100% with you, if they don't add content it will die.
---
I wish they would do backwards compatibility, but I don't think its greedy that they don't do it.
---
Vats, adrenaline, gunfu, chems, bobbleheads, magazines.
---
i had shotgunner expert shotgunner both maxed demolition expert maxed and still only got 700 dmg out of my tse combat shotgun...i got it up to 900 when i used psychobuff/tats one of them. now im getting 220 dmg with my tse..still the most powerful weapon iv owned in the game..im lvl 135
---
They/we are still here checking each time its patched lul
---
good lookin out
---
God I hope so. I am fearful because that cleanprincegaming guy just released a video saying they are giving up on them and then accused Bethesda of doing illegal stuff. It’s like what the freak is going on?
---
I've had others working since posting but bog town didnt. I'm sorry if it appears I was annoyed, but the plant one still doesnt work. That's 80. Haha. 
---
Why would you even do that though. You scrap all before you do any crafting. And you shouldn't keep bulk on you for any reason other than to sell. It works from stash for crafting 
---
Yeah ammo is what turned me off to ranged... but tse is explosive which is also an aoe can aoe melee? I agree they should probably up the vanilla damage and armor penetration of ranged weapons 
---
Your post is a bunch of preachy nonsense that accomplishes nothing. I have friended a ton of random people I've met playing the game and virtually all of them agree with the same topics I see posted here. Know your audience...
---
IT guy here. It dosn't always mean up/on/active. It can also mean quick and/or unplanned.
---
If you have any tables in your house that are slightly wobbly, that might be a better use of it.
---
I’ve spent thousands of hours on destiny/ division.   Even though they aren’t mmorpg they’re good examples lol.  
---
Maybe because a 50% increase to a low base damage gun is a bad idea. Maybe furious is the better prefix for a minigun. In FO4, it seemed to increase your base damage by 15% per consecutive shot. Your damage would double after 7 shots. How much more damage would you be doing after 50 shots? 100?  That's where the damage is for a minigun. TSE isn't the end all answer for every gun anymore.
---
Do the math for me. You know your base damage. I can only speculate. What is a minigun? 10 damage per shot? With furious, that increases to 75 damage after 50 shots. 150 damage after 100 shots.

The amount of “stress” you claim to assume about at bethesda is probably dismissible lol. I worked in the most stressful job taken by a consensus in I think 2014/15 in the U.S. and it was hard. Working as a programmer at Bethesda is as likely as easy as it sounds. You sit and fix bugs fast, wow. What a fucking joke. Try being a MARINE CORPS communications operator in Afghanistan and then tell me how “stressful”  it is. 
---
I think the modders are severely under appreciated. FO4 the mods kept me playing the game and gave me so many options to play with.
---
FO76 has ignored all of this. It's a shame that modders are solving the fucking problems and doing far more than Bethesda is with the issues the players want fixed.
---
Bethesda should be double ashamed they can't even let others solve the problems they won't and then implement the fix.
---
Yeah I've pretty much always used it to mean a small corrective update to fix regressions from a major update...
---
Yeah lost 2 legendary mole miners during uranium fever earlier
---
You're still taking rads and if you're making soup that's 2 wood, which is easy to get but annoying when the semi useless purified water is unlimited once it gets going. 
---
Also I get so much purified water from events I'm constantly dumping 20-30 bottles
---
It seems like I have lost some weight though. Maybe I just didn’t notice and now on my game they read as weighting nothing.
---
&gt;physical media
---
Disgusting. 
---
You been missing out. Game has always been awesome!
---
It’s a big and will most likely be fixed tonight with the hotfix.
---
That’s odd my tse shotguns did 570-600 with only one shotgunner perk maxed out and no explosive perks
---
Ignore YouTubers. They chat a lot of rubbish like saying it's going free to play. It's just warmongers that were probably banned for duping 
---
So stealth isnt fixed???
---
Duper your days are numbered 
---
Yup. Much like "Hot off the press". The patches are made quickly and still "hot" when being applied.
---
We sound like twinsies. Old enough to know how to power game it but not enough time to actually do it...
---
I’m not good at math I guess but 1.2 is twenty percent of 5.2 so I still don’t understand the numbers you’re putting out there. 
---
Tried them on some molemen.
---
TS: 9, 7, 8, 8
---
AA: 7, 9, 6, 7
---
I guess the AA is really slightly better and as chbchb59 said TS screws with accuracy so I guess I will keep using the AA
---
Uh...after this train wreck patch I’d give it a couple more weeks until they finish hotfixing the issues their merging mistakes caused.
---
It's hard to say because the PVP system is so lacking. I'm only judging by taking bounties. I run a bloodied/unyielding build. I one shot most people on a bounty. Sometimes I get  quick one who tries to stim pack but I power through it and out swing their healing. Honestly, I think the Nerf removed any counter to my build.  
---
The worst part is that I've never made it to low health. I've been one shot before but in a fight, it's always near full health and I one or two shot them anyway. Now there is no counter my build... Melee will rule the world.
---
Power armor gets none of the benefits of regular armor.  No percs, no invisibility, no extra damage boosts vs whatever.
---
I think he's right, but I see what you're saying lol he's definitely talking shit
---
Honestly this was a problem before the hotfix, will continue to be a problem.  
---
I believe the issue is that once dead they clip through the ground and are unlootable from player perspective. Since we can't clip through the ground.  
---
I saw this a few times at Whitespring resort, where I'd look and see Ghouls I just killed sitting under the porch, just out of my reach to loot.   
---
Same issue also causes some workshops to be unconquerable as they spawn under ground where you can't kill them.
---
Congrats! You found an Easter egg that represents how Bethesda maintains and updates Fo76! Good work!
---
Yea maybe they can work something out so it does the original dmg to npcs but not players
---
&gt; Ammo is expensive in this game
---
Expensive? You actually pay for ammo? 
---
That was a lot of words to say you like giving your money to corporations for broken games and that they should be applauded for releasing such lol.
---
It's an amazing game, despite all the bugs and server disconnects, until you are reaching end game and then blah. I look forward to it's development though, I'm not giving up on Bethesda.
---
So we're on a down swing now? :( 
---
Try bulking the game with others 
---
All of these bugs reek of offshore development. It's the only reasonable explanation. 
---
Hahaha sorry that's good right there 
---
Fair enough I'm sorry for saying such a thing is near slander for myself too. I stepped over the line.
---
Never heard of a plan to fix it (at least on PS4), you just have to make a new character and run outside if you want the achievement
---
I completely disagree. The new player experience now is loads better than it was when the game first came out. Serious game breaking bugs like getting permanently stuck in power armor and having to drain it to get out are gone. Yeah they fudged the last patch a little bit but it contained many things specifically requested by the community. 
---
I hope you gave that thing a good kicking ....
---
Me too, under the S
---
I'll add that elder scrolls online was an absolute shit show for like a year and a half before it got decent and now a few years and like 15 dlcs later it's still going strong. 
---
See, was that so hard? Now, to analyze things:
---
...
---
So this is *partially* valid. Bethesda has said before that too many items affect the server, so having a character with an excessive amount of items can presumably cause "unreasonable or disproportionate load on the infrastructure".
---
That said, this *doesn't* say that mule/bank characters are illegal; it only concerns the number of items stored, not why the character is storing them. As long as your mule isn't overloaded and/or you use a number of different mule characters, there's no violation under that section.
---
So, using your source, we can conclude that, while having a lot of items is enough for Bethesda to whip out the banhammer, mule accounts themselves are not.
---
&gt; To play your silly game, the second sentence kicks in, SHOW ME WHERE ZENIMAX authorized your use of a mule?
---
Why? I'm not claiming they did. *You're* the one saying that they're banned, which is why I asked for proof. 
---
Generally speaking, though, everything that's not forbidden is permitted. If Bethesda doesn't ban mule/bank characters - either implicitly or explicitly - then they are assumed to be allowed.
---
&gt; So you can't? next time come prepared. Your in denial about your actions, its okay.
---
Ooh, spicy. Just so you know, complaining when people ask you to back up your claims is not a good look.
---
it sure is a strange set of affairs when we can not even use normal game mechanics with out the fear of the ban hammer.
---
never in my 35 years of gaming have encountered a more toxic playing environment!!  it is not only the players, BUT THE GAME MAKER TOO!!
---
Yea I know. I just logged in now to see what’s going on because that videos worried me. I want Bethesda to succeed on this game because I do enjoy it and I do believe they have released some good patches. I will admit that the last one wasn’t the best but I wasn’t going to quit over it like it seemed so many were. 
---
Do you know any more specifics than that by. Hence? I’m looking for them and can’t find them.
---
Well they had to fix that you couldn't use bulk scrap somehow
---
Shit! 
---
When you first pick one up on a session it should create a quest showing you where to go, there's more than one but the only one I know of is following the bridge up the hill from Flatwoods.
---
On my Xbox I only have enough memory for like 4 games at a time 
---
Again, I have no idea. How do I check?
---
I’m not saying they haven’t fixed problems. I’m saying that this game has had much more negative feedback than positive feedback. Also the business practices of bethesda up to this point have not exactly been great.
---
My dude, these guys just want to be mad for the sake of it. No amount of logic is going to help. 
---
The only thing grahm had different from anywhere else was heavy combat legs when I found him earlier
---
I'm pretty sure what you are describing is a repeatable encounter. I've run into the four of them standing around supply drops, around the Mr. Messenger quest spawn points, etc
---
Yup did it multiple times before noticing smh
---
Lol its not saying much when the prices for vendors go up. The vendor prices are already extremely gay.
---
It’s good for game developers to take chances on game. If they don’t then we never get innovation and having played games as long as I have I am pretty sick of the same old thing being made over and over again.
---
Why not?  3 months in and we have player housing you can customize.  The quests issued by NPCs in Ultima were on par with any Rose sends you on.  There are fights with bosses... Good chance factions could come (in the Ultima sense for those familiar). The persistent world piece I agree with you is a HUGE difference and one I miss... But that said, I think there are plenty of things Ultima had that 76 does or could have to draw the comparison.
---
"You're the one saying that they're banned"
---
never said that, I said it was an exploit, which it still is.
---
System bog man?
---
I like this idea, doubt it'll get implemented but I really like this idea.
---
https://youtu.be/yetwdpsiM8Q
---
Remember the teaser where it literally said that you'd want power armour to do nuke zones and that nothing was lethal and only using a radsuit was dangerous?
---
Yeah, we were told that at the start 
---
...You literally called what both Bethesda and Sony did with Skyrim and Last of Us respectively bad business practices.  Further, bad business practices are exploitative.  Releasing a game on a new console is not exploitative.  You can choose not to buy it if you already own it.  I don't think the way your strawman portrayed, I think that remasters specifically become excused from being bad business due to the option of purchasing as it inherently employs no exploitative tactics.
---
Yeah but if we delete it they're going to assume we abandoned for good and not want to spend resources to fix it
---
Let me give you some tips.
---
* If you start to get heated just walk away.
---
* Not everyone dissenting is trolling.
---
* NEVER say you're gonna walk away and then stay.
---
Agreed I think they did a bad merge
---
What? Not even close to what I said. I never said that. All I said is that just because one country does it doesn't mean all the other ones are. It's a big deal when multiple countries do it, not just one.
---
I enjoy aspects of it, but over all they dropped the ball. The last man on earth thing could have worked very well under other circumstances, but the mmorpg thing doesn't dove tail with it. Bethesda fucked up plain and simple.  i just wish they'd release the Appalachia map for Fallout 4 as a DLC.
---
Their timely fix that actually managed to find a new way to break one of the 3 things they specifically said they were fixing?
---
Let me get the base numbers.
---
Totally quit reading this when I scanned below it and it said Stop. Full stop. No idea what is being said here but it seems like the common guy taking up for the common player. Zzzzz. Something about how ppl who spend over 200 hours into this already blah blah.. 
---
End result. It sucks. No perspective will change that until they patch my perspective.
---
lmao. I read a very helpful comment about how crafting min level leather limb pieces (1-2 of them specifically had the particularly low mat requirements) costed so little you can craft an insane amount of them with little resource cost and learn all of the leather mods including Studded (I had scrapped so many pieces already I thought it was just un-learnable) so I then proceeded to craft several hundreds if not breaking the thousand mark. Actually cost so little to craft I gained more mats than I spent with all the crafting/scrapping perks equipped including Super Duper. Apparently, Bethesda's little crafting tracker thing is as lax as their learn rates are draconian.
---
I'm with you on this one - as a "thing to report on", install/uninstall would tell them very little. Connections are much more informative.
---
Watch out, you might getting banned bc they detect you as a duper boi! This would be a good joke but unfortunately it could be true...
---
Build a camp at the derelict house near the fire station and put a Paper Street Soap Company sign out front
---
Here here.  I think i have like 30 hours or so in the game.  I have other life priorities in life which limited me to maybe 5 to 7 hours per week of console time.  I havent played in 3 or 4 weeks due to other commitments, but ive had a time slot ope ning and with the latest patch install i decided to come back to the game.  I probably wont notice any difference in the game since i am lvl 32 or something like that and dont have to deal with all these issues the full time gamers are whinning about.
---
Where do you get prime receivers?
---
Yup, Im done too.  You think circumventing in game mechanics isn't exploiting, I think it is.  We can agree on that yes?
---
So I've been getting this since the hotfix maintenance today. I'm on Xbox. I was on when there servers went down.
---
Anyone else?
---
I have something called GeForce Experience, is that it? And yea, NVIDIA settings is in the dropdown in the bottom right of the screen.
---
Sorting power armor separate from regular armor would be great too.
---
Even better though, would be if they split AID into FOOD/WATER/CHEMS so you could actually find whatever one you are looking for without scrolling through a huge list.
---
Lol... try doing it over and over in that order. See if the value continues to increase. Please post results. 
---
If it does, it could be the same database issue they faced with the zero carry weight
---
PC. It’s a work in progress at the moment as the cool beer signs aren’t out yet
---
There is. They say they went to dupers camps and picked up their stuff. So he had duped items, which he admits to knowing we're duped, and he got banned for it
---
That's not true for me. Before it took 50-60 shots for a level 50 SB. Now I can't kill one. It doesn't even recognize I'm doing damage. Not everyone who had these weapons are dupers or crybaby's. Well see how you react when they screw you over. Then everyone will call you a duper and a cry baby. Honestly I paid fill retail for the game. I'm not any less deserving of having a good time as you are.
---
2 Star i believe, it has 40% faster swing speed and deals more damage with each consecutive hit on the same opponent
---
I am sure they have crazy dependencies that require the game to be running on production like environment to test things and no Dependency Injection setup so they can swap out mocks and do the tests. \*facepalm\*
---
If you are bored and want to play then play. Game is a lot more stable (though still not great) and many glaring bugs have been worked on. As you already have the game you have nothing to lose other than a few hours of your time.
---
Understood, that mutation is a must
---
**The river on the western edge of the map:**
---
Positives: newbie area  so weak mobs, few visitors, peaceful
---
Negatives: far from shops, more expensive fast travel
---
**The ponds and river south of Rosie's Top of the World**:
---
Positives: Walk to the raider vendor. Cheap fast travel or short journeys to whitesprings and other stations
---
Negatives: higher level mobs, more popular so often can't "place in world"
---
Snip snap snip snap snip snap
---
This is not Bethesdas first time making a multiplayer game. With all the hate ESO got I am surprised they didnt even try on this game, I thought theyd try to redeem themselves a little bit.
---
Afaik you can't bulk any of the junk that can be sold individually. There isn't any purpose to doing so. 
---
go back to when you get unlimited XP disarming nade trap
---
IMO, the fact that a major dev company managed to revert to a previous build by accident is certainly worthy of awe.
---
Everything they fixed is good on my end.
---
How about instead of punishing players for turbo-bulking, throttle it down so we couldn't do so? It's not a duper issue. I've had up to 700 steel after x hours of gameplay, yeah I'm gonna bulk &amp; sell.
---
What are rads? I don't know of these "rads" you speak of. Care to elaborate?
---
You can clear any rads you get for free at the enclave bunker back entrance. So that is a moot issue.
---
I wonder what happens if you previously had it installed?
---
If he had money he wouldn’t be playing on console, lol. 
---
Judging by that definition...sounds like it was indeed a hotfix. Just several pieces of code instead. 
---
We won 7 👍
---
Shout out to the Doctor who cut my arm off on accident but reattached it the next day.
---
None. Just like a 10mm and the cookoo clock plan I already have. I wanted to get another long coat for a buddy. 
---
With a bit of patience he’s easy to get though. Fast travel, run down past the telephone pole, turn around. Not there just log out and look again. 
---
I also read he’ll only spawn like once every 2 hours or something so I usually only try once then move on. 
---
Even the usage of "its" is weird. It's very dehumanising. Its is what you use for animals. The word should their "their". #pedantoff
---
I'd wait until the new PvP mode drops and try that. That's what I'm looking forward to.
---
Pretty sure it is to left on map from quarry x3, saw it on my way to get the albino at the power station
---
And we’d have to have someone assigned to cooking only “clean” food. 
---
Well, I can't say I have much hope. I have been fairly critical of the game and the dev team from the start. From the game being released out of beta with no changes to basically an entire month with no patches from december to january a month after the game comes out in such a state it was pretty clear there isn't much priority for fallout 76. I still like the game, I don't play it as much anymore but shit I got over 100 hours into it and still do log in from time which says a lot. There are many great games I have put much less time into and paid just as much or more as fallout 76, fallout 4 for example for me, but people don't bitch and whine about them because they are single player games and as long as it was fun and relatively polished from start to finish that's that. People seem to have this idea that fallout 76 should give them endless gameplay from the day it releases until the day they decide to stop playing, which shit yeah that would be great but come on, like you said lets get a little perspective. All these people on here who have already put hundreds of hours into the game in such a short time acting like they are entitled to so much more or something NOW. The funny part is there will be more, they are just too impatient and think because there are a few people they can circle jerk with and join in on the echo chamber on reddit that the game is doomed/dead/destroyed/etc and that these posts here represent the actual majority of normal players, which is far from the truth.
---
A month? Boy, you're optimistic!
---
great idea, but when beth can not even fix simple problems with out re-introducing old problems, new content is in the DISTANT future.  :-(......
---
This method could cut both ways, on one hand it could drive the team into overdrive to address issues and make the game play properly but, it could also kill whatever momentum remains inside the company to do so equally well.
---
The longer a person goes without playing a game, the less likely they are to return to play it and this can be seen in many games, a notable example being World of Warcraft. While the spirit may be there in the beginning, it does wane and over time, a person can grow accustomed to the idea they wasted money and just use that as justification to avoid purchasing the next title or installment from the developer.
---
It's my hope that those who do uninstall make a return or at least maintain activity on the relevant forums and monitored areas of communication (like Twitter or Reddit for example) to demonstrate continued interest  but, if they don't, I fear that development will simply cease and the game will be relegated to maintenance-mode.
---
Casual gamers shouldn't be the target market, they're not the ones spending all their money. You're literally making excuses for them and shunning those who enjoy spending vast amounts of time on them. Basically, you're an asshole defending other assholes.
---
But cool perspective, nonetheless.
---
I enjoy seeing how assholes think.
---
 It is a bit of an issue early game, though radaway is not exactly scarce either.
---
I mean it is _kind of_ how the economy works, it's a monopoly so they charge what ever they want for them...
---
It’s Radworms. With Radworms I am at 640, without 530. I think it relates to Marsupial and the armor itself 
---
Gathering water from a pump 🙄
---
Crafting guns isn't bannable, scrapping guns isn't bannable, crafting anything as quick as you can isn't bannable. That's all bullshit excuses from the cheaters than got caught....
---
Bug finding is actually the end game. And they actually manage to gives out this kind of end game content every update. I said they do much better than any other game in the world. No one can push new content like this this quick and follow the tradition every updates. 
---
Would love some feedback on the Mirror Ball as well..
---
About your edit: The difference is Bethesda didn't expect people to be playing Fallout 4 every single day the way people do with fully online games. I agree that their DLC release schedule is basically fine as is, BUT they launched the game with a woefully low amount of content. I'm reasonably sure I've done every non-repeatable quest (and *almost* every repeatable one) simply because there's such a small number of them.
---
I bet you have no friends and wonder why.
---
You probably wouldnt notice, 0.001 is practically nothing. Not sure if this will show any differently, but try examining the bobby pins (right stick click?) 
---
I say that bc got a behemoth slam attack item put into my inventory (dont ask lol). In the pip boy it showed value of -1, at the vendor menu it showed 0, and in the inspect screen it showed -2million something.
---
Appeal to authority? It is a bizarre effect, thanks for pointing it out, now I will never be able to unsee it.
---
Maybe ask again next patch.
---
It was a lot of words to say several things.
---
I value things, just like you. I just value **different** things. 
---
I value being invited to participate in a product before its design phase closed down for good. 
---
Nobody invited me to do that with Fallput 4, or with Call of Duty. 
---
Bethesda invited me to do that with F76. 
---
I value polish, but not as an absolute measure of worth. I can forgive lack of it in exchange for other stuff. Like being invited to weigh in while the devs are still shaping the game’s 
---
And working in software myself (and having business school training in modern software entrepreneurship) I understand both sides of the “ship early” versus “ship polished” debate. 
---
Yes, in many cases you **have** to ship perfect. You can’t continue developing a dialysis machine after handing it over to the client. 
---
And sometimes the competitive environment is such that you can’t. If CoD didn’t ship pixel perfect polish, Battlefield would eat their lunch. 
---
But sometimes you can, and the trade off and benefits makes sense. The benefits to BGS in this case are death avoidance. 
---
They’re not afraid of shipping bugs. That never killed them and won’t today 
---
They’re afraid of shipping something that even in pixel-perfect form has no appeal to anyone at all, and the way to avoid that is to ship early, put our feedback in the room early in the design phase, and aggressively iterate on that feedback. Which is what they’re doing. 
---
lol, this is something they have reported as 'fixed' in the hotfix patch note.
---
Great work guys. 
---
Yes. I currently have them unlocked in standard and heavy.
---
You're toxic. Lol
---
Yeah, who needs hard facts when mob mentality rules, right?
---
I've been playing since launch, ESO is fun, tons of content, and it's a beautiful game.
---
FO76 was a curiosity for me since I loved FO4.
---
Whoops! 
---
No I didn’t see that.
---
It's not a question of absolute stress, it's a question of relative stress. But I suppose that doesn't fit into the manual they make you read while shouting Semper Fi.
---
I love that we're being downvoted for a small joke :D
---
You're like me and the word glitch. Glitches aren't a thing. They are called bugs. 
---
It's been reported that after fixing the issue with bulk items not being usable in crafting that now when you use the "scrap all junk" option it now also scraps all bulk items as well.
---
So basically their hotfix broke one of the few things it was suppose to be fixing. It's seriously as if absolutely no one on their dev team even tests the hotfix before sending it out.
---
Im sure they can tell by the server volume?
---
I knew it, glad to help.
---
You also cannot sell bulk to vendors either.
---
Yea it’s still weights 0. That’s fine with me lol. 
---
Lol sea of thieves is still bad.
---
Ok sweet. Downloading the hot fix rn! 
---
You literally quoted a section of the rules that indicated actions that are not allowed (i.e., banned), then claimed that said rules apply to mule accounts (i.e., making them a thing that is banned).
---
But yeah, you didn't say those words. You just used other words to mean the same thing. Totally different.
---
Sort by weight or value is pretty easy way to find em quick
---
Let it burn. See if you can write it off in taxes. They killed it, Jim
---
This is what happens when you hire a ton of new devs to build something brand new (multiplayer). But then tell them they have to use a 20 year old engine to do it.
---
Appreciated! But can you also just give us something regarding the future content Inside the Vault has been hinting at for weeks now? Perhaps a bonus article this for week discussing whatever Inside the Vault was going to be about before all of the patch mayhem?
---
Head north from the Geafton station. Super mutants and scorched are what I generally run into.
---
Just *imagine* if you could not only sell ammo, but do the old barter/swap system. We could all buy anything, and Bethesda definitely don't want that
---
I forgot about writing books!  And agree on the placing items.  And being able to display stuff and "lock down" items would be cool.  But that's part of my point.  It's only 3 months in.  Bookmark this.... By next year you'll be able to display bobbleheads....
---
Unpopular opinion here, but I like a lot of Bethesda titles because of how unbalanced they are. “
---
Instead of nerfing some stuff, buff everything else!” -wise guy
---
Happy crafting!
---
i have been on I64 for about 2 weeks now.  gone thru 2 iterations of my camp as i collect plans.  river too far for large water purifiers, but i got 3 or 4 small ones that serve my purposes just fine.  i set up there because i get lots of traffic.  i got a rest area for other players.  a stash box for them to use, and i leave the water purifiers unlocked.  help yourself to some fresh, clean, purified water.  :-)
---
i have a great time sitting in my home window, with my sniper rifle, picking off super mutants that come lumbering down I64. 
---
Looks like this sub is now showing up all over YouTube again. Apparently mods are removing criticism of the game. I’m surprised this one is still standing lol
---
I mean it's going to be boiled when you make soup. I agree. I'm guessing that devs didn't want to allow for 2 different ingredient types to make 1 item(boiled or purified).
---
It's funny you say this because in 1997 no one had broadband.  We had dial-up BBS services and AOL.  There was a day 1 patch for Fallout 1 that removed the timer for the water chip and I didn't know until ten years later.  Patches weren't common back then.  Even if they were released very few people actually implemented them.  It was a different time.
---
No most things you bulk end up lighter from what ive seen. Like .038 per bulk stack vs .01 individually, whenever i bulk all junk i save like 3-4 lbs. Maybe its just me though
---
that guys cadence is unlistenable
---
Read my comment below.
---
I totally agree with you on this 
---
It was working for me post-patch. You can test it out yourself, contracting rad warms isn't that hard to do anyway lol
---
Thanks! 
---
All I can think of is that their beta/live team is tiny and are desperately working their asses off to get up to speed with what should have been in at launch.
---
I'm honestly more disappointed by the rampant toxicity of the FO76 sub right now than I am in any of the specific changes introduced in the last patch. Thank you for being a voice of reason and speaking up for the fact that these changes, in the long run, will benefit the game as a whole.
---
They made mistakes, the QA was sloppy (I'm surprised that anyone's surprised) but by and large I think these are changes the game needed.
---
The spreadsheets tell a bigger story than the  tiny percent of players trying to build the perfect OP end game.  That level 20 guy gives zero craps that something he’s never seen was changed.   
---
And the fact that Bethesda bothers to spend five minutes in Reddit says quite a bit.  I don’t believe they are ignoring anyone, but the reality is that they have to make this game better for a larger percent of players than just us.  
---
Life sucks sometimes as do nerfs, but it tends to get better with time.  Every single OP build I’ve ever done has been hit with a hammer, but it really never changed the playability of the game.  I had to change my attitude to understand it.  
---
Now I just play.
---
Bulking items doesn't lower their weight anyway. 
---
Far cry was a masterpiece 
---
"hours of my life wasted" on playing a video game.   
---
Hm. If you think actively playing a hobby is time wasted, you're doing something wrong here. 
---
They need to undo the TSE nerf. That ruined the game for a lot of people. Myself, and i assume others as well, enjoy getting to a point in a game where they feel the grind is over and they are mostly untouchable in most PVE situations. Now that the damage has been nerfed its not quite that way anymore. I feel like i did at level 35, not quite as prepared for nuclear fallout as i could be. Ive defended the game up until this point. The nerfs went too far. Now i feel like bethesda is in pool of baby oil slipping all over unable to get up.
---
&gt; I dont really get the point in this post, 
---
It's basically OP trying to defend Bethesda and be a contrarian because people are justly criticising his favourite thing.
---
Go back to FA4 or Vegas and stopping whining about offline. Seriously GTFO. 
---
Yeah I thought I had one, thx for the advice.
---
That's from using up plastic. There's a post here somewhere with a spreadsheet on the weights. 
---
Lol..
---
I am. It kills me that the game looks good. But there's no repercussions for companies that screw their fans over. Other than boycotts. 
---
Maybe not all of them, but maybe one. The experiment being how people adapt to a constantly rearranging environment. 
---
Stealth sniper here, too. With a tse lever action. You having any issues with a damage bug where tanky enemies hp regens in chunks, making it hard to overwhelm their regen to kill them?
---
Wondering if that old damage cap is back, seems to only occur with sneak/covert op 3/Mr Sandman 2 multipliers and all riflemans 3 star. 
---
Well the sales speak for themselves. It did worse than Battlefield 5 in sales. Couldn’t even make the Top 10 selling games of 2018. Even though all the fanboys are crying about how it couldn’t possibly be true, that Bethesda is not giving any shits for this game or knows how to do damage control lol
---
Beside some bugs that cause disconnections at pretty crucial times (silo, after defeating SBQ) its been alright overall. 
---
Gregggggggggggggggg
---
If someone buys the game, plays it for 2 hours and then never touches it again their stats still count but they're not part of the existing community. It doesn't take into account how many casual players aren't actually players anymore, and the rarer the achievement the smaller that drop off is because it's the hard-core players only that get the hardest achievements. 
---
So no, PS4 trophies don't really work as an indicator. 
---
I respectfully disagree. Sea of thieves is awesome now. They’ve added so much. I always have stuff to do and the seas feel dangerous. I love it.
---
I want private servers anyway lol
---
That's nothing special; every other time I run into a couple of Super Mutants I learn that there's already been someone who surpassed the last strongest SM and became the new one. They're clearly improving as a species so rapidly that it's only a matter of time before not even Bethesda's weapon balancing will be enough to stop them one shotting the SBQ.
---
Could not have said it better myself. These people on here are delusional sometimes and I am sure they get themselves worked up a bit too much since it is so easy to see the posts that make it to the top of the subreddit and how they have a few thousand upvotes and in their head they think, "Wow, lots of points and number one on the fallout 76 subreddit, this is now reality". 
---
For the vast majority of players this past patch and now hotfix will have been nothing but great changes.
---
This is just demoralising. Like they just cannot get anything right.
---
I use to think that management was clearly incompetent but I was unsure if the devs were equally incompentent or they're just doing their best given their terrible management. 
---
This issue clears it up for me - the devs are equally incompetent.
---
Or at least give the vendor distribution some rhyme or reason. 7 different factions but until you get to the mire and bog you are limited to 3 factions max
---
Remember, if you got banned and lost all Bethesda access and you cheated. YOU ARE NOT going to admit it when you are trying to socially manipulate the internet train to create a PR mess where Bethesda unbans them. We need substantial proof that the person is innocent before we go ahead and attack Bethesda on this. 
---
But the above post gave no identifying information? 
---
Beth should use modders as works for hires to implement their mods. Give them named credit in the game as well.
---
Hotswap, is live hardware changes, drives or cards etc. Hotfix is not the same but often confused.....
---
Mutation effects turning off randomly after hotfix didnt happen yesterday
---
Very good point actually, I'm running Fallout 76 on a Win 10 install with no other 3rd party programs installed, many Win services turned off, no other games. I just log onto my main OS for other stuff, this SSD is only for 1 game, so stability is fine, game bugs etc I just put up with, but it is playable, like it fine, gtx 750 ti and an oldish I guess i5-4670, works OK.
---
I'm still having a good time. Only level 16 though. Have been kicked from servers a few times, glitched into rocks once or twice, but overall I like it! I understand it's not in its final form, and I'm interested to see what it will end up like!
---
I don’t think it’s that big a deal. Like all previous fallout games there’s bugs and glitches. 
---
The majority of which eventually got worked out in previous games. As I’m sure Bethesda will do to fallout 76.
---
I realize a lot of people had high hopes, I did too. And yes I thought they would have had the game more finished upon full release. 
---
But I can also see they used the best game testers they have to hand, us.
---
All we can do is keep pointing bugs out to them.
---
There’s no point in getting mad about it, life is too short. 
---
And if they don’t fix it? Then you are probably looking at the last fallout game. 
---
Because I know the majority of people will walk away.
---
Bless our Mums and Moms :)
---
Ppl buying from dupers are good ppl? Fuck em
---
Every new patch update is like ordering Denny’s when you’re drunk. You think you’re gonna be satisfied but you end up with disappointment but dig through it anyways, only later, to find out you’re now dealing with diarrhea.
---
It may not be for everyone but for those who it is for they made it pretty darn good. Bethesda needs to do the same thing with fallout 76. It might not be for everyone either but if they work at it they can please the players they have now and who knows maybe it will blow up like SOT is now. 
---
The game keepa getting more and more shittier and im starting to hate it
---
 That is the root of much of the angst.  It is not the game they wanted.  Hell, it is not what I wanted, but I am enjoying it warts and all.
---
I have not seen a fix to the game that solves the myriad of issues that have plagued this game from launch. Small minor fixes here and there do not change the fact that this is a preemie game that should have spent some more time in the oven. And some of the improvements reintroduced old problems that were solved before. Its one step back... and a hobble forward with this game. I also think the balance change stealth nerfs were just ways to even out the grind, that way no other form of grinding feels inferior. 
---
Uhm ps4 has updated that way since launch.
---
Yepperz.
---
Hahaha this is like super basic stuff that should have been from day 1.
---
Like very very bare bones. I doubt it will ever be added since Bethesda claims our one stash box already pushes their servers to the absolute limits.
---
Welcome to the wasteland fellow redditor!
---
There are voting machines everywhere, they should let us use them already
---
It's almost as if they put next to no thought into what players want from these systems or how they impact one another.
---
Yay for lighter stashes! Yasssssss!
---
Who cares? If they want to spend money to get good stuff, let em lol doesnt affect you 
---
The last real remnant of this that I can remember is in Skyrim.
---
You know Faendal and whatsername that he and . . . other dude were fighting over.
---
If you marry her and take her to your home - sometimes you'll find him there.

I picked up a 1TB ssd for $180 on boxing day, I wonder if I could use that for my PS4. The horrifyingly bad loadtimes on console due to the HDD are the main reason why I rarely use it except to play with my friends who only use console.
---
If I can use an SSD with my PS4 to improve load times that would open up so many possibilities.
---
It’s free in Germany if you buy a new controller
---
&gt; But the regressions in patch 5 just should have been caught, bottom line.
---
Testing is the industry's red-headed stepchild.
---
I’ve actually always had that issue, even after the explosive fix back in the day I was still occasionally having that issue where half their hp would regenerate immediately after a shot. Especially with scorchbeasts. My assumption always was that:
---
A) the second bullet and it’s explosion was bugging and healing because of the anticheat like previously
---
B) the grey hp was bugging and just making all of the hp grey
---
Because every time it happened it would be a shot that  would have killed them but rather only took away half the hp the grey hp showed. If that makes sense or sounds similar to your problem 
---
They nerfed the most duped and op legendary affixes.
---
They also did a bunch of big fixes and created a couple new ones.
---
was wondering why my carry weight went up to 550
---
I think explosive definitely needed a nerf but “two-shot” is basically one &amp; 1/4 shot now... makes no sense
---
Are you giving vats time to settle?  Just compared a ts handmade with my normal hunting rifle (roughly same acc/range) and other then bit bigger grouping didn't see issue ADS.  The ts handmade didn't have issue hitting molerat's point blank or at med range in vats.  
---
I don't have a ts and normal of same type to how much ts throws accuracy exactly.
---
ok so I dug this up and its exactly what is happening to me. I am also getting perk card notifications I dont have. The thread is a month old. I only noticed it after the recent patch. Looks like it never went away or came back. 
---

---
I'm still failing to see why a nerf to already mildly unusable explosives weapons was ever a good move. Kind of just sounds like the studio was scrambling to put TSE weapons in their graves and tore down an already acceptable class of weapons.
---
How many people did you see actually whip out a fat man or missile launcher every now and then before the patch?
---
How many people do you think will do that now that it's both extremely resource intensive and straining on your inventory space *and then also doesn't do jack shit for damage*. May as well throw the explosive damage out of the game at this point tbh, especially those rubberized grenades.
---
Tbh, I'm thinking about uninstalling it from my consoles. Went into updates and wouldn't you know it, another 50gb update......
---
How are they in denial?
---
Fallout and Sea of thieves both hit me where it hurt, I been with SoT with alpha and Fallout with beta, and both have progressively gotten worse for me as I’ve reached the end and done all I can do.
---
Definitely a lions fan
---
:((
---
I have unistalled a while ago after reaching lv50
---
I did that 50 years ago thanks, once is enough.
---
I think that plan is bugged, if youre looking for the one with the blue vault tech sheets, its “simple modern bed”
---
I dont use power armor, that's why I'm upset.  White Knight is for non power armor users, which is already a smaller crowd.  And a naturally weaker one.  And all they did was make it even weaker to play without power armor.  And the fact that it is oddly specific, as you pointed out, makes it even more frustrating to me why it was nerfed.  It feels like they targeted a very small playstyle and just got rid of it.  I understand nerfing two shots, they were unfair to go up against.   I do not understand nerfing explosives as a whole and bringing fat mans down beneath a two shot musket.  
---
Don't wake up Hermaeus Mora, it won't go well.
---
Having to cope with life by breaking down stress is sad. People already have everything else breaking down around them. 2 genders to 7 in school, autism to spectrum autism and now you want to start a discussion on the different type of stressors? Get the fuck outta hear. 
---
The only reason you get to speak your mind like you are doing now is because of Marines and others that have died to keep us from speaking Farsi, German and Japanese.
---
Your welcome.
---
&gt;Bethesda said that the atom shop is "just cosmetic stuff.
---
That's a funny overspecific dementi if you look at the current "event".
---
Wut? Dude you in the FO76 subreddit. This sub is known for being a fanboy sub and removing most post that criticizes the game lol
---
I see, so besides selling unwanted junk i basically have 0 need to waste plastic bulkin shit? Level 35 and fairly new. Played all fallouts before and picked up everything new in 76 pretty quick. But its a different creature lol 
---
Was about to post the definition as well.  Glad someone already has.
---
I paid for it, tried to get a refund. Bethesda refused it because I downloaded the game. I looked it up and with my local laws, refusing a refund of a product this way is illegal, especially if it wasn't as advertised or defective. I told Bethesda this multiple times and got no response. So in my eyes, as the movies say, 'the Jedi are evil'.
---
Hi, I am a high level player who chose to go the explosive build route on day one! I play all my Fallout games with this build cause it is what I find fun. I didn't choose these weapons cause they were "broken." I didn't go "exploit" some area of the map, instead I went and completed every mission I could. After finishing said missions I just went out killing anything and everything. Your assumptions are poorly construed and not encompassing of high level players, just a small portion. 
---
I’ve killed it too it’s not a big achievement 
---
All scorched seem to drop tons of radaway.
---
If they can track it, it’s probably tracked
---
I’ll play tomorrow send me a friend request, GT SamsterMac
---
hub = queen
---
Not at all. A hotfix is typically one that is performed outside normal development updates. IE - if developers are using scrum then a patch is typically done during a sprint/iteration which has different parts:
---
- planning
---
- dev cycle where code changes happen
---
- automated tested and/or manual testing
---
- review
---
- release
---
yeah there are tons of streams and small lakes in that area, mostly south of the monorail elevator. In general the whole eastern edge of the divide cliffs have a surprising amount of water.
---
 I only use PA(X-01) for nuke zones and the Excavator for scrap runs.
---
Duper. You are so getting banned. ;)  
---
Kidding. I couldn't help myself. 
---
I wish they'd open a vault that would let us create a new character and come out of the vault as a ghoul or super mutant, or any other creature that might result from a vault experiment (GARY). Even if they're limited to the survival server or something. Hell, why couldn't we play as a Deathclaw or other creatures too? 
---
And they need to rebuild on a modern engine, and should have NPCs and TSEs weren't bad. Why limit yourself to just one impossible fantasy? 
---
Yeah. I've accepted it for what it is and I'm fine with it. 
---
It's also ok for people to not accept it for what it is and not play the game at all. A lot of people have done that too.
---
It bothers me a little that people can't just accept that 76 was never intended to be nor never will be an offline single player spin-off like Fallout: New Vegas.
---
The sooner they accept that, the better it'll be for all parties.
---
If I log in PA my carry weight is higher than if I enter it after being in the game. This has been a known bug for awhile and I am not complaining about having the extra weight. But I can't get out to craft or repair with out the risk of getting stuck somewhere and not being able to fast travel. 
---
Correct, bulk is only for selling, except for aluminum and lead. They weigh half as much as usual bulked for some reason. Likely a bug 
---
Agreed. Anyone stupid enough to pay money for gear deserves it imo
---
Had a few crashes and the grind/play balance is still way off, but overall I'm loving it. I paid full price for it to play during BETA and I'm happy to have done, I've definitely gotten my money's worth.  Experiences with other players have been almost unanimously positive, too. 
---
Did this today, deleted files and all.  Got so sick of returning when I had time to play after work, and seeing either new bugs or old ones resurface altogether after patches.  It’s gotten to the point where after defending the game and Bethesda for months and seeing things like threads getting deleted or people posting bug roundups for the devs, I can’t in good conscience continue to play it. Absolutely not trying to dev bash, but I’m really starting to wonder if the Austin studio lost a game of Rock Paper Scissors.  I get it; they are trying and doing work, but they’re NOT LISTENING TO US.  I feel awful giving up on it, but like... after this last patch, it’s like they’re not learning anything
---
That’s a lot of rounds fuck me
---
&gt;This issue occurred when a merge of our development builds failed to execute properly
---
Uhh, Where i work, we fire Dev or Dev Ops people for this kind of shit getting into production...
---
... we don't even wait until the end of the week or day.
---
Just give us your ID Card and leave.
---
The idea it was duped is what makes me unwilling to do anything with it
---
They nerfed explosive and two shot weapons which many people heavily relied on as they were extremely strong. They also reintroduced some bugs they had previously fixed in patch 4, but they re fixed these in a hot fix today so that is mostly resolved.
---
Hmm odd lol. Well thanks for the info! What do you play on? Pc, ps4, xbox?
---
 hubs have to be accessible to all and free of combat
---
tse is still good. two bullets =  explosive twice. 
---
Me too thanks.
---
my bulk didnt autoscrap last night...guess im lucky..and i did sell some to vendors..
---
Ps4
---
it does 24 dmg for me. with some perks for increased heavyweapon dmg.
---
yeh vault tec beds arent what they say and the simple modern bed isnt simple its the vault tec bed.
---
they put different cosmetics under different names dont ask me why its so annoying
---
Regression testing is a fad.
---
I realized it was laziness when they claimed to fixed the 21:9 wide screen support but in reality they used a cheap .ini file adjustment to just stretch the picture to the screen instead of a true aspect ratio fix that modders have been using for years to fix it for FO4. 
---
Fucking lulz is all i gotta say about that
---
Hit the button with two rectangles when pipboy works it’s a simpler screen that always works may not show up at first but will when logging in
---
I hate to say it but that’s just nuts if you think SOT has got worse. That doesn’t even make sense. How does adding more things to do and collect make the game worse? How does adding more sea monsters, a new boat, an entire new area of the map with freaking volcanos make it worse? I don’t get that at all and the game has as many viewers on twitch as Fortnite does sometimes. It’s definitely blown up the past few weeks and deservingly so. Rare got to work and improved what was a fairly boring game with little to do into something that’s pretty dynamic and has a bright future as it continues to expand.
---
The far west edge has a lot of good build spots and a fair amount of resource points too that are close to the water.
---
there is a stream due East of Top of the World as well. Probably won't be too bad if you aren't on/near one of the ore deposits as those can be popular. Good to get as far from the road as you can too. That's a bit too high traffic for me.
---
Hub = white spring golf course =) 
---
Bulk autoscrap is post-hotfix.  They broke it fixing something else
---
Keeping your head buried in spreadsheets leads to stupid ideas. For example the idea that to "fix" PvP you should nerf something that is primarily used in PvE. As someone that does not use explosive legendaries and is using 10 perk slots to support my throwables build, explain why Demolitions Expert being nerfed is balanced. It looks to me like they looked at the spreadsheet and forgot there's supposed to be a game at the end of it.
---
 Absolutely, not every game is a fit for everybody.
---
Fair enough, I'll strike the comment, point taken, I was getting all hot under the collar. Just getting fed up with all the negativity.
---
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, maybe it only does if you experience that problem, lol. It's hard to describe to folk who haven't experienced it. A shame you've been experiencing it all this time, I'm just now being hit hard by it after this patch. 
---
Didn't mind the tse nerf so much, still stings, but not being able to kill something without busting out an automatic to overwhelm that regen has me sitting on the bench. Costs too much to kill simple super mutants now. :/
---
Wow. Speechless. 
---
My Polished Metal Right Arm and both legs are each ~50 DR, Chest piece is 120. And the only legendary armor i have is one vanguard arm which if im at full health is 65 br, 75 ER.
---
Best armor right now for me is metal, followed by legendaries
---
So when I say headshot I mean “weak spot” just like a sentry’s fusion core, protections chest, etc. either way it’s not even a dominator just a normal ass assultron with what is supposed to be the best tier sniper in the game pre-hunting rifle addition I guess, haven’t seen the numbers on a hunting rifle yet. 
---
Deus Ex!
---
What was your favorite build?
---
Damnit... there goes a shitload of my plastic
---
That’s why I repair/craft/bulk at my base. Hopefully this can be fixed eventually.
---
ROCK THE FUCKING VOTE
---
yeah, that is the one.  god this game is getting annoying.  so "simple modern bed" is the plan for the vault tech bed?  mmmkay.
---
Yep.  I end up selling a fair amount.
---
I can be wrong but wasn't the point of Inside the Vault to inform us about upcoming changes, new content and whatnot else instead of being a patch note?
---
Thanks I understood but it helps me little now. and unless they make it mandatory to watch every piece of media I don’t think this works in reality. There will always be people like you, who see it and people like me, who don’t.
---
Water PURIFIER should totally make boiled water
---
I have a phone; but I don't have a canvas bag to lug around all these heavy ass bobby pins.
---
Bethesda should stay away from online gaming for awhile. It's clearly not their strength. 
---
Yep this bug is so annoying wasting ppl time and effort 
---
Cuz dupers do it to give the shit away.
---
Two shot isn't down 25% it's town to 25% overall it's had 75% reduction and is therefore not two shot anymore it'sa1.25 shot and it's the same story for explosive it's not down 20% it's down to 20%.
---
We're all in the same boat. One trick I tried today was to take the Bandolier perk (level 2 giving 90% ammo weight reduction), then just carry all of your ammo with you. Dump fusion cores unless you actually use power armour regularly, dump explosive ammo unless you use it, etc. 100 pounds of ammo in your stash translates to only 10 pounds in your inventory, and that's equivalent to 1 PA chassis
---
And the minute they start talking shit in a completely unrelated forum all of that respect for the uniform goes completely out the window. You aren't a soldier here bucko, you are just another gamer talking out of your ass.
---
I have 4,000 Atoms from playing and I've never spent a single one.
---
Give up on the game if you want because it sounds like maybe you’re not going to be satisfied no matter what happens but it will be amazing if Bethesda does for fallout 76 what rare has done for SOT.
---
It doesn't require expert game designers to realize that publishing a patch that *undoes the previous patch* by accident is a really bad idea.
---
&gt; many times can you say I'm sorry?
---
I aim for zero: when I don't shit the bed, I don't have to apologise for shitting the bed 
---
This kind of comment they never reply to 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
The game already has coding to handling that - things marked as quest items are impossible to modify. We'd just need a mark item button in the pipboy interface. 
---
let him back in his glory buzzkillington
---
I quit posts
---
It probably spied some poor fuck on the opposite side of the map and decided to grief him till he had to log off
---
Ohh shit lol same. I have no mic atm, i threw my old headset and broke it a month or so ago, gonna be gettin a new one soon here just been puttin it off. If u ever wanna team up or anything add me: Complecks99

Chaoscythe
---
Sbq did that to me I was pissed

---
This. Modders are well aware of how lazy the devs are at Bethesda and always had to fix all their messes
---
Truthfully, I can’t recall when or where I bought. If I had to guess I’d say it was from Greg in Grafton or Phoenix in Watoga Shopping Plaza. Hope this helps 
---
The point is they were US marines, and it totally fits.
---
They all died out in Appalachia, so they didn't go on to spread anywhere else.
---
It doesn't break the lore, it fits fucking perfectly.  And the whole satellite communications angle works even better (because they have regular coms, them the satellites run out of stationkeeping fuel and fall out of the sky - it all makes perfect sense and fits 100% with the lore.
---
It is not a valid complaint; because the whole thing fits in with pre-existing lore (and the fact they got wiped out fits great with the "they weren't anywhere else")
---
How is a low level person supposed to chill at the golf course when it's getting nuked?  Hubs are towns where people go when they're not farming. 
---
hmm.maybe mine is only lvl 45 not 50..would that make that much difference?
---
Scrap for black titanium xD
---
My favorite was the skeleton catapults at the edge of the map. Found those yesterday after 270+ hours in.
---
My ears are sad, one of the cool things about Fallout are the audio FX.
---
Probably not but idk
---
Yeah you can only invest 15 Points into strength. There are perks/armor that increase your strength tho. Radicool alone can give you a Total of 20 strength. 
---
Once in awhile you attract some horrifying beast of the deep instead and have to fight it.
---
Excellent description.
---
How would a developer move forward in terms of upgrading or replacing an engine like that?
---
Does an entirely new one have to be coded? Or could a new fandangle Unreal engine be used to develop with?
---
Dude, I have no idea why you're being downvoted. You don't deserve it, especially not on your cake day. Its just the try-hards and rage babies unleashing their rage upon the innocent. 
---
I called what last of us did bad business practice specifically because little work was put into the remaster and was still released as a full release, only a year later. Skyrim on the other hand, it adds mods for consoles (and ingame mods for pc for thsoe that dont like to go outside of their game for mods) and better graphics.
---
No not ALL remasters are bad business practices, however I think the majority of them are strictly because they dont put in enough time and effort to make them worth rereleasing, especially at full price. 
---
I dont understand your reasoning behind remasters being excluded from bad business practice because you have an option to buy them, You can say this about ANY bad business practice. Lootboxes? oh they are cosmetic only and dont affect the game therefore optional. okay then.
---
Did not have it when I encountered him. I went back for a 2nd look
---
&gt;few years
---
&gt;long period of time
---
_But it's our money and they want it NOW!_
---
Cool cool, i added you. Idk what level u are im sure higher than me lol
---
RIP explosive vent. 
---
It's exactly what I wanted because the only time I'm carrying bulked items is either to sell them, or when I buy bulked lead. But I also realize this isn't a good change if the vast majority of people don't manage their inventory that way and it's costing them precious time and plastic.
---
when did we get hotfix? is that like a patch?..but we dont have to download it?
---
I don't even know anyone that uses that perk. I might if legendary Pipe Revolver existed.
---
They aren’t bad at all. Most of the ones I’ve done, I’ve experienced solo (both by will and coincidence). 
---
111, 22, 2 lol
---
Do the BoS quest chain mate
---
Iirc it starts at Abbies bunker?
---
I agree completely with your statement and thank you for making it. This sub seems to have a lot of people who believe that if they bitch the loudest everybody will listen to them. Seriously if you do not enjoy a game, uninstall it. Same thing goes for the rest of life if you do not enjoy one thing then do something or figure out what makes you happy, find a new fucking job, get a divorce, make a new friend. Just stop bitching about it and make a change. 
---
This budget/stored camp duplication glitch, intentional or otherwise, is still very much in the game. I experienced it just yesterday when seeking a new place for my forever camp. By about the fourth time I moved my camp, I had 86 walls, 30some floors, 6 fusion generators, 20some water purifiers, and a whole mess more than should be allowable by budget.
---
I said 25% down from for a reason
---
Maybe I can sell you mine ;) 
---
Is this why they had to reuse Fallout 4 models?
---
ah ok..
---
I see lmao, 35 ish i believe, just the 1 character atm. I held off on buying it with the hope Bethesda would have most of the bugs fixed. Boy i was surprised! Hahaha 
---
They really screwed the pooch with vault 76. Mr handy are cleaning and reorganizing, at level 10 misc objective to check out the vault renovations 🤷
---
Endurance perk that gives more strength depending on how much rads you have. Max is 5.
---
Or as we were trained to say at an old job, "unscheduled maintenance"
---
Are you new to PC gaming? I'm surprised you don't know much about the parts of your computer, that should always be information you have on hand when troubleshooting performance online, but that's fine.  
---
Assuming you're using Windows 10, while you're on your desktop and not in-game. Press the Windows keys + R. Hopefully you know what that key is, if not, looking it up will show you pictures. Again, assuming you're using Windows.
---
After pressing the Windows key + R, a 'run' window with a text space will pop up. Type in "dxdiag" , without the quotes. 
---
This will open the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, and it'll start scanning information about the PC. The window has multiple tabs at the top, the first tab you start on "system", which lists what your processor is, how much RAM, among others. 
---
We want your GPU though, so at the very top, click the tab labeled "Display", and it'll tell you the device name you're using, and the manufacturer.
---
Sure the result can be considered "minor" but the underlying issue, which is the devs being absolutely incompetent (patching with an old version? Really?) is a big one that deserves attention
---
Haha I just read it with a comma and I get it my bad sorry
---
Ok then I want a blurry photo of someone holding today's newspaper in front of a raster image of text
---
Checkmate atheists
---
i had a similar experience last night.  went to morgantown train yard.  went to USA box car where a PA suit is.  pulled off the t51b helmet, torso, and left arm.  when they went in to my inventory, i had 2 of each.  unintentional dupe?  i guess this is how the diehard dupers discover this shit, by pure "axe-ident"  lol
---
i have met 3 other pipe builds on xbox since launch, and 1 other redditor. (i run rank3 of it)
---
Yeah, I gotta agree with you. Part of me gets some of the frustration, like you said, there's no reason the game should've launched in the state its in, but, like you also said, they have been doing a lot of work fixing many of the bugs, glitches, and stability issues. 
---
It would be nice for their to be new content now, but, I'd rather wait and have good, bug-free, new content, than rushed out the door and barely playable new content.
---
Most of the people here are the hardcore players, they want to play everyday for hours each day, me personally, I already have a game like that, when I log into 76, I'm looking to sit back, relax, and play a fun exploration game with my gf, and nothing else. If I took the game more seriously, I'd probably be pissed, but I don't.
---
And one last thing from someone who's played a lot of online games, nerfs suck, they always do, but a lot of the times it's justified.
---
Did you have to build a standard?
---
What a great suggestion. I work in IT.  Merits, my friend, metrics.
---
Long story short: some business applications include a "take survey/post suggestion" with their launcher/landing page, which then launches a website. There, each account holder can either create or up-vote a suggestion/fix - up to X (and no more than X) - so you have to choose, for example, which top 3 "fixes" you will upvote.
---
It's democratic, and it kills the never-ending "my idea is the one everyone needs" bullshit.
---
You'd better believe the top 5 nearly always make it to the next incremental upgrade... and it filters out the noise.
---
Good, more vaulters! Though I guess they won't speak English. Hrm. Well the wave emote works in any language.
---
They just nerfed explosives for being too effective and didn't take into account the resources and weights and perks needed to bother trying to use them, and then considering that they seldom are used by the people who do bother lugging around missiles and shit. I could imagine a nerf headed towards heavy guns because the .50 can fire for too long without reloading based on Bethesda's thought processes for balance.
---
Just waiting to see one more mindless nerf before I shelf this game.
---
You gotta do the BoS mission to get in.
---
You're not wrong, but you're missing a key factor.  The 80/20 rule says that 80% of a companies income comes from 20% of their customers.  
---
The people in this sub are the 20%.  Were the ones who have spent hundreds of dollars on bethesda's games and merchandise.
---
They released a broken game before it was ready.  The problems we've had will already effect the game for it's whole life cycle.  The greifers and cheaters already have the most OP weapons, and I don't know if there's anything that can be done aside from resetting everyone's characters back to level 1 and starting over.
---
Bethesda abused their loyal customers trust, and it's on them to fix it.  This weeks patch may have somewhat fixed a few of the problems that should've been fixed before release, but overall it was a big step in the wrong direction.
---
Do you not have access to a PC?  It runs on a shitbox from ten years ago.  It runs full speed with mods on my laptop and it's not that great of a laptop...
---
Not shocked. Physical sales of 76 were low.
---
Shelf space is worth more now
---
Hop server should spawn on same place 
---
Have you considered that it's possible that players have quit playing the game and therefore never hit certain levels? This would skew the percentages greatly.
---
That’s not what he’s talking about. People are getting banned in this sub for criticizing the game. This sub is popping up on YouTube again today from a bunch of different channels and other video game forums talking about the shady shit mods are doing in this sub. 
---
Maybe....
---
And mexico should pay for that, too!
---
They probably meant perks for other guns or damage types.
---
They need to expand on that storyline. You see the liberators everywhere, the stars on the houses, yet very little backstory to how they got there. 
---
this is really cute, you went history diving on me to prove your point, except that the purpose of this thread is called ***uninstalling*** so your quotes of me on another sub are completely irrelevant and do nothing but illustrate your lack of comprehension
---
now what happens when i look at your history?  
---
on the first page i count about 60 posts (in about 10 days) all pathetically and blindly defending bethesda while talking about dupers and exploiters
---
whats even more hilarious is that out of all those posts this one has  the most upvotes at 5
---
I’d be down... hopefully your on Xbox?
---
If they do it make them pick; trade the card for 5 repicks or even a card pack, or move 5 special points. You only get 1 or the other if they go that far. It doesn't take long to level 5 more levels anyways...
---
All of the people I've met in game don't care about anything other than having fun on the game. They all agree the try hards are annoying when we're trying to take down the scorch beast queen without some headasses coming in with their OP weapons and trying to initiate combat with us, or when some rage baby on this sub complains about minor things that Bethesda is working on fixing. 
---
We just wanna play the game, man
---
I can definitely take the extra armor off your hands if you want some fusion cores for it :D
---
Idk, but they dont deserve to be ripped off.
---
Wow. I mean, I do fall into the category of enjoying it, if only in limited circumstances, but that’s just toxic. I’ve never heard anyone say that but that’s not right. Bethesda has fucked up and they need to fix it and do it right. If Starfield screws up too, we’re really gonna need a new company to step up.
---
I know. But where's the fun in that?
---
I think he's saying it's a bit harsh to assume someone is a moron for making a simple mistake with a counter-intuitive power armor mechanic. I check mine religiously, but you have to agree it's kind of silly we have to take out all of our PA chassis to check what armor is equipped. It's well known *now,* but it's an easy enough mistake to make.
---
A certain popular vendor is close enough to bait scorch beasts over.... 
---
Heavy, explosive and energy weapons are all set to get buffs to damage and durability within the next couple patches.

Did you know that when World of Warcraft first launched hunters (ranged DPS with bows and a pet) were broken so bad that they had to run as melee DPS for a very long time? Point being... MMOs have a lot more things to be taken under consideration. Should've waited longer, but since you're here, have fun with it anyway :)
---
The only thing that even talks about their origin is on the loading screen haha
---
&gt; 4k upvotes compared to the tens of thousands playing is my point to the big picture 
---
We haven't gotten any concrete numbers on who's playing and who isn't. I want to say that last number that was given, was a straight up lie by Bethesda followed by actual numbers being less than a million. So I mean sure, a good portion of people aren't a part of the subreddit, but unless you're going to stand outfront of Vault 76 with one of those picket signs- No one is really reaching all the players.   
---
And on top of that, Bethesda recently has deleted posts on their own forums that heavily criticize the game. And on top of that, this subreddit is more active than their forums for the game.   
---
&gt; Accusng me of stupidity rather than taking the time to realize 4k of you upset compared to the thousands of active users on the servers that marginalize the 4k you speak of suggests you are on the wrong platform. 
---
And as I said before, tell us what Platform we should be complaining/commiserating on? You apparently have such a good grasp of how to actually reach the devs and the studio, so share that knowledge bro. 
---
&gt; Unfortunately your failure to identify that this is a way to "hurt Bethesda" or "giving to the man" is just wasted time. Again,. Boycotting on a large scale sends a message. 
---
I mean man, you either have to be stupid or new. There are plenty of things written daily  that show people want to boycott the game or speak out against it's poor management, but then there are people like you who just need to "nay say" the criticisms other people have about the game.   
---
Before you, it was plebs saying, "bugs aren't a problem for me!"  
---
Before you, it was plebs saying, "I don't have any server problems!"
---
Before you it was plebs saying, "I haven't encountered any dupers!"  
---
Before you, it was plebs saying, "This game is only going to get better!"  
---
Essentially you don't have a stance, because having a stance on the game would actually require you to form an opinion. And doing that would obviously be too hard for someone who thinks the best idea to show Bethesda we mean business is by uninstalling the game and not saying *more* needs to be done.   
---
So I mean, yeah- Have a good day you miserable piece of fucking horse shit. Go play in traffic. 
---
Conveniently, Bethesda seems to ignore 3 of the 5 items on that list.  Let me edit that for ya.

It was actually a fairly respectful reply, read it again and you’ll see that I didn’t insult you out at all. I questioned your conversation path because I think you are stalling and then I quoted old tv shows and said “get the fuck outta here” like Fonzi or whatever. Sorry if it stressed you out to hear to “get out”. Then I stated why marines where valuable in response of you trying to take value from them by insinuating that they “read manuals and yell Semper Fi” as if they were just brainwashed grunts. And for the record, there are no soldiers in the Marines so no, I am no soldier here or ever. maybe if you read a war book every once in a while you might learn the easy to spot differences between branches. Good attempt at an insult though.
---
Game is more balanced now. The ppl with duped op guns got knocked down a peg.
---
As you can see alot of commentors traded for duped gear and are now nerfed.
---
If you're starting fresh then its a good time to get into it.  Griefers aren't as powerful anymore
---
I don't remember, sorry. But I do remember seeing multiple options when hovering over the receiver category, after priming it. 
---
I definitely understand that man. Even when gta online came out it was a nightmare, now its... "Good" lol i def think 76 will get 100× better like with all things, with time. 
---
I agree, that should not be end game content... But the SBQ is the only end game content... And now there's no reason to kill her.
---
Lol you believe those people huh?
---
Funny
---
Than he should reword his post, because many other people have gotten the wrong idea too. 
---
I'm pretty much right there with you. The only time I ever bulk stuff os if my stash is getting full and I realize I have way more of something than I need. It gets bulked and I head straight to the vendors to unload it.
---
I'm honestly not sure why people would run around with bulk junk in their inventory anyway, but I can see how it would be annoying.
---
Just gotta find anything to complain about don't you. 
---
they may not be using scrum/agile at all. when you have millions of lines of code, it is almost impossible to have automated testing prevent regressions. only thing that can be done is writing better test cases
---
Depends what part they update.
---
Rockstar games are split into 2 parts.  Online and sp are patched independently
---
Should have been titled "Fallout 76: Survive This You Gullible Mother*******".
---
That happens when you have next to no end game.
---
rofl BF4...
---
So the games still terrible and the absolute worst game of 2018? Got ya. Too bad, because fo76 has its moments of real fun hidden under layers of constant farming, inventory juggling, repairing/eating/drinking what feels like every 10 minutes, and its lack of real purpose thanks to no real endgame orbit fights.
---
You were supposed to realise that smiley meant I was being ironic.. 
---
10x? It feels like Knuckles and Vents each have a 49% drop chance, leaving the last 2% for all the rest of the mods.
---
Same. I still had the beta installed by the time game launched. And now that it's a full product, I can't find an uninstalled button. Just a "purchase/buy" button.
---
No build is going to last 10 second in a fight with a tse shotgun.  Got to admit I haven't been fighting anyone like that, or for that matter engaging in PVP at all.  
---
But I was mostly suggesting that there's no investment to getting power armor.  It's a one time repair fee and then days of playing without worrying about repair.  I run the no PA tank build and I'm constantly struggling to keep my gear intact, particularly since they just made every level 50 armor cost ballistic fiber. I keep armorer and lucky break on all the time, and my armor is still constantly broken. 
---
Wow I hadn't heard of Atomic Heart yet.  Thanks for the heads up!
---
Since they intended bulk to be used to sell items, I can see why they would do this. It's different than it was, but it may not be by accident. It's far from game breaking and I don't believe it really effects many players. I only tend to carry bulk items when travelling to vendors, so this only matters if I stop part way for an event or something. 
---
Two shot didn't need to be nerfed at all. The accuracy penalty is bad enough, now it is a completely useless effect. My two shot plasma rifle went from 66 to 33 damage. I mean 66 hardly hurt any big creatures, but 33? I can hurt them more screaming "Fus Ro Dah"! at the screen. And it shouldn't be called two shot anymore. It should be called "One and a Quarter Shot."
---
There are two vault tec bed plans marked 1 and 2, both are available at one of the whitesprings vendors.
---
1 is a basic mattress on the vault tec frame and 2 has the sheets.
---
Agreed. Been blowing through food/drink since patch. They are really turning every single aspect of this game into a grind.
---
Excuse me.  I forgot this did not have anything to do with pvp "balance" so it will be a long time.
---
west tek.
---
spawn in kill the mutants always 1 leg at the back kill him get leg loot server hop and repeat can get a few legs in 10 mins this way
---
I can understand carrying it because it weighs less on you that it does in your stash, but given that it's the only thing you lose on death it seems like a risky strategy. Especially given the broken state of PvP and the fact that people can still 1 shot you.
---
Ps4 but I was just being cheeky =) 
---
Just got a chance to play. Two hour "update". Cant play until done.
---
This is my last online game I think. Only other one I have had was the Division and while I loved the game I hated these mandatory updates. Fuck...
---
No he isn't missing the point. He just turns a blind eye and ignores the point. 
---
You might actually be on to something!
---
Better yet, DON'T waste your money on Anthem or ANY cosmetics!
---
This!!! I was so stoked when I found the ramp next to sugarmaple i think, with the bike and skeleton over the wall and in the next parking lot.  
---
It’s almost like they don’t fucking test anything before they release it
---
Hanging on a tree, with a lot of wind chimes hanging there also, it felt eerie.
---
Valid point. 
---
Aww
---
The newest patch pretty much gave you the opposite of that, so at least they're listening.
---
It's "Should have"
---
Full disclosure, I picked up this game on sale and I do enjoy the fallout universe so I’m slightly bias. I’ve had the game crash on me once and probably had about 10 of the usual Bethesda bugs happen to me over around 100 hours of enjoyable gameplay. So it’s not ignorance when I say fallout 76 Is no where near as broken as people say it is, that’s my opinion and experience with the game.
---
There is a lot of inappropriate dev bashing going around, we don’t know what the circumstances are for a lot of the devs decisions (like time frames ect) and the poorer decisions most likely come from higher ups. 
---
There’s also two sides to the type of people your complaining about, people that actively hate the game and are vocal about it just because it what’s cool I guess?? “Hey guys look at my thread about fallout 76 sucking, give me that karma.” This also does not help the community 
---
Try our r/fo76FilthyCasuals I heard it’s a sub dedicated to just normal casual discussion of the game. 
---
"The only reason people hate the changes because you are the 1% and dont deserve to be catered to."
---
What a fucking pathetic joke if a post, honestly. How did this garbage get gold?
---
i would have thought by now you would be used to doing things a second time after the first failure
---
I have spent 500+ hours on the game. I have been doing quests, doing a lot of exploring, played with my friends, made new friends, roleplayed, lots of base building, leveling different characters and builds, done more exploring, killed hundreds of scorgebeasts, launched nukes, farmed whitesprings, killed the queen (which is even more fun now that all TSE noobs are crying about the game being too hard), done some more exploring and quests, joined a brotherhood of steel community, grinded my ass of to find good weapons (still looking for my dream weapon unlike alot of cheaters out there), helped new players, talked with random people about random stuff, stalked noobs sniping their enemies from afar if they got in over their heads, got scared when a bear suprised me and lots of other things.
---
Alot of the things i do in the game is more social interaction and less playing a game.
---
Even though the game is unpolished it is MUCH better than all other survival games i have played.
---
A fallout MMO has near infinite potential. Even in the state it is in now, it has great potential. Sure there are a some very loud people crying, but there are plenty of us still playing and enjoying 76 and eventually we'll see what it's to become. 
---
Reasons like this are why I've stopped bothering with anything tied to besthesda. Glad to know, after a few years, that my decision is still waranted.
---
Yeah, I wanna use my sentinel armours!
---
Cool. Never been there, but I'll keep that in mind
---
Thanks for admitting you don’t know what the hell you’re talking about in PvP. Thanks for chiming in.  
---
Not even subbed to this reddit and i shit you not i’ve seen more posts talking about “stop telling us you’re quitting.”
---
I had this problem too with scorchbeast disappearing. I have a feeling it's related to bloody mess as it was only happening to one character and stopped soon as I switched that perk out.
---
Please tell me if there are any plans to introduce firstly the barbed wire poles and next be able to blend the concrete blocks like in fallout 4? When this was missing from 76 it was a real blow as that ability in game made the structures far more interesting, creative and functional.
---
I'm not so worried about build limits as I am the noob version of the building concept which was far superior in fallout 4.sorry but I hate it when they devs go backwards
---
Pretty sure you jinxed it. Either way, that's 7 teams that are never going to live down the shame of losing to the Cleveland Browns.
---
I thought I was imagining it. Yes, I am as well.

Do you wanna catch Mirelurks? Because that’s how you catch Mirelurks!

Here are a list of fails Bethesda has pulled up so far with FO76: 
---
- The first, major red flag was, besides the "exclusive launcher deal", the ridiculous amount of bugs in such a short time between BETA schedule and release day (literally 1 - 2 weeks away). 
---
- Second major red flag: the canvas bag for the preorders of Collector's Edition. 
---
- Third major red flag: The "cardbox CD" in the "physical" versions. 
---
- Fourth flag: $5 slap in the face for the "no canvas in canvas bag" deal. 
---
- Fifth flag: Plethora of bugs. One bug fixed, 250 more appear to wreck the game. Remember duping? Remember "ultra wide" fix? Remember Dev room? Yeah. 
---
- Sixth flag: Microtransactions worth more than what grinded for at in-game activities
---
- Seventh flag: Suspension/Ban policies. 
---
- EIGHT (still at it) flag: Customer service at refunds and restitution of canvas bag for collector's edition (GG fourth months in wait)
---
- NINTH (we're getting there): "Nuka" Dark "Rum" (barely qualifies as a rum) with a novelty slap-in-the-face price tag of $70 for a bottle that isn't even as advertised (plastic rocket-like casing instead of rocket-like glass bottle). 
---
And, here we are, at the TENTH red flag: Unstable servers with backrolled status of previous bugs that were either a) nonexistant and/or b) supposed to be fixed. 
---
I don't want to blame the people who believed in this game (as I did) and bought it shamelessly (which I didn't). But it doesn't take that much with the reviews, the clips and the list of bugs this incomplete mess of a "game" has (the irony of being a product made by a supposed "triple A" studios) to really see the full picture of what is going on. On top of that, there is a clear lack of support to the modders of this community that are fixing what Bethesda has messed up since day one *with little to no compensation* in these matters. 
---
The developers that are rushing in and fixing this clearly deserve more than just and an applause (the level of commitment into this is...wow). Regardless, it is clear how abysmal and misguided the director of this project has managed to concieve a poor product with no clear direction of projection toward the general player population, much less able to concieve a game that is using a heavily-modified engine that is dated to almost 2 decades ago.  
---
I've got 2mbps download, so no.
---
There is nothing better. The Sims comes close though.
---
Fuck gamers who are so fragile they need to believe their $60 is the right choice in life. Reminds me of.a certain political party who only thinks about themselves winning despite the big picture 
---
They actually haven't committed to it being released in 2019.  They said it will come out _when it's finished_.  What a concept...
---
Their silence is deafening.  If it was intended they would have said so.
---
Literally whats so bad about the update? Stop bitching for easy karma
---
How is being spoonfed Bioshock-esque tape recordings that result in whatever you do not amounting to anything a "cool original story?" I'll admit there was some promise of at least things picking up in the beginning, but it felt like being on a museum tour guide over something that already happened by the end.
---
Go level up

This isn't true. They are on record saying that they had people from every office, every studio subsidiary working on Fallout 76.
---
Truth. I was kinda worried when i saw online only but i love it vs what i thought id think of it! The only problems ive had are disconnections, invisible players, and sadly the worst of them all disappearing camp items.
---
This subreddit flip flops everyday on which side to circle jerk to though
---
thanx for the heads up!  +1
---
Of the 7 vendors I typically hit, those 2 and Phoenix are the only ones that don't have stash boxes, but it's easy enough to work around that. Load up until you're almost overencumbered, travel to HF and sell shit. Travel to Watoga station, clean him out, grab more stuff, and walk up the street to Phoenix. Fast travel to Whitesprings Station, load up again, clean him out, and walk down to the bunker. Fast travel to Sutton Station, load up one more time, clean them out, and then travel to Flatwoods to finish the run
---
The whole loop only costs me ~50-60 caps depending on where I'm currently camped.
---
Seriously. He even posted on that shithole subreddit asking people to brigade this post. Tell me how that isn't against reddit rules?
---
There are really a surprising amount of water spots, even in areas you wouldn't expect. Explore everywhere. Forest probably has the most, but also much more likely someone will also be on a good spot. Scout an area for a while before you spend time building. A lot of spots annoyingly will have mob spawns close enough that will just plague you constantly.  If you're going to camp on resource spots I highly recommend getting way off the beaten path and especially staying out of really busy areas like the forest. Some of the ones close to top of the world are pretty contended as well. Lake Reynolds near Lewisburg looks nice, but I guess there are regular scorchbeast spawns there so probably won't work out.
---
Some nice areas on the river south of Morgantown, and the other fork west of that. One of the first camps I ever saw was a really nice over-the-river cabin north of flatwoods. 
---
There's a small canyon with a stream, roughly between Helvetica area and Greg's Mining supply, though you'll get lots of Scorched if you are too close to the town there. 
---
Poke around in the far NW of the map. There's at least one small lake complete with a dock that's more or less on a mountain top, but I don't recall exactly where. That whole area is great in general, though honestly not that much water around.
---
I've never been 1 shot until I engage the asshat trying to one shot me.  And if you travel in a team it generally wards off the asshats.  Do not stay grouped up so close that they can attack you all, they see this, and know they will lose.
---
I hope not, I have about 3000 .50 cal ammo stockpiled and now the plans are available for purchase all the time.  I was disappointed with the .50 cal the first time I used it, because I had no perks for it and it's inaccurate as fuck at any range.
---
Yes, that's the intent. The PA arms are your weapon. Almost as bad as truly unarmed. All arm mods are garbage :)
---
The difference between a remaster and a lootbox is a pretty big one.  One is predatory gambling to obtain new items.  The other is purchasing something you already have.  Remasters don't prey on addiction, one could argue that they prey on nostalgia, but if you already own the game purchasing the remaster is purely out of convenience to not play your currently owned copy.
---
They need it desperately. 
---
I think the sub is more representative than you think, and if you think a 171,000 is a tiny portion of players after all these issues, you'd probably be surprised.  Just because not all players are vocal doesn't mean they can't use those who are.  You are right in that they have to choose what they consider the best direction, but only through feedback can they do that.  Statistical data can only give part of the story (quantitative).  Video games rely on qualitative success as well.
---
Also, they did not take huge steps because the steps forward were again negated by the steps backward.  I get what you're trying to do.  The reddit is full of people who desperately want to believe that this will all just go away, but it won't.  
---
Are they working in the right direction...  not yet.  They have a few good ideas, but the execution is abysmal.  As unhelpful as you think it is when people panic, I also don't think it's helpful to be hopping around rainbows.  You have to be realistic.  Posts like this that are more about fan behavior than the game are just not helpful.
---
Also, one glaring issue in your arguement...  If the people willing to play a game in this condition for as many hours as makes them "grinders" as you say are upset, then BSD should listen.  If the extreme loyalists are ready to walk away, your casuals have for sure moved on.
---
Hm. Not sure how that would go down. Lol 
---
This is the part I don't get.  How can you compare it directly when it takes up 2 more perk slots?  
---
I thought about that but I wanted to keep it on the up and up.
---
Not sure how you can say that with a straight face considering everyone has offered 12 metric tons of advice only to have it ignored. You know who deals with criticism well and will fix things? Modders.
---
The dehumanization was intended.  Don't try to make me nicer than I want to be!
---
You said there were more downs than ups. Yet the game has only improved. Reddit is a tiny, tiny fraction of the players and I would not in any way consider the people here to be an indicator of the average player of this game. I prefer to make my own opinions rather than gauge a game on the opinions of others. So far my opinion is that it's a really fun game that still needs work.
---
Okkkkk.....if they cant keep their players coming back, why waste the money and time to add such a feature?? No one will be around to enjoy it...wishing thinking.
---
That’s not what private servers means 
---
Yeah i am level 27 but so far only two server crashes on my first day of playing. Otherwise smooth sailing. Fiber optic internet might be helping. 
---
They don’t have to. Not that maybe people got it apparently. Actually it did worse in sales than Battlefield 5 and we all know how bad that went. Neither Battlefield 5 nor Fallout 76 could even break the Top 10 list for best selling games of 2018 and now Fallout 76 is being given away for free in Germany with the purchase of a PS4 or Xbox controller... This game is dead as fuck. 
---
I’m just here for the dumpster fire lol
---
I’d like to point out that most of the criticism has nothing to do with player level but somehow you’ve rallied part of this subreddit to generalize a large portion of players criticism into “you’re too high level to have any perspective “ and that’s prove to be wrong in nearly every video game.
---
Yah, but that's you. The majority of the people will move on and not come back. That's the cost of not striking while the irons hot.
---
Especially important if they plan to add pvp
---
&gt;LOOK AT ME!!! I HAVE DONE WITH THIS GAME! YOU SEE?
---
If you start pulling down your pants I'm calling the cops. Don't show me that you sick, twisted lunatic.
---
Uninstalled 2 days ago.
---
I appreciate your understanding of my perspective. I have only launched one nuke myself and I came to the Whitesprings cheese about 5 times early on to see what all the buzz was about. It’s kinda boring for me although I can appreciate why people grind it. Most of my time has been spent capping workshops to get resources and plans because camp building brings the most satisfaction for me in this game just as it did in Fo4. The SBQ fight can be fun with a decent group and I have enjoyed that fight more than any other quest in the game. It’s good content. 
---
With that said, I think it’s unreasonable to expect players to server hop elsewhere to avoid conflicting interest in a nuke zone. It’s the pinnacle event in the game and you must understand that many people will show up. It is especially unreasonable to expect everyone to stay away if you are just going to hop on another server and launch another nuke and consequently expect everyone to stay away from that one as well. From that perspective, you see the core issue with this endgame design. 
---
Without additional content the most grand thing a player can do is grind nukes to build a god mode character and Bethesda has made the
---
choice to pull back much of the power that players have acquired. We must now either start the grind process over or bail out until additional content is added. I’m opting for the latter. I will come back when the vaults are opened up and I look forward to seeing improvements in the game. 
---
I uninstalled several weeks ago. Before all of this. I saw there was nothing coming to this game. It’ll be a year until content drops. That’s what these live service games do. They release a couple patches then go dark for a year. It happens with all of them. Plus this game is a mess on top of it with no real end game incentive. 
---
I can't wait for Outer Worlds. Someone on here showed it to me, it looks slick! 2019 release, though.
---
Just found Calibrated Shocks mod (1) at R&amp;G but haven't found anything else for Excavator PA.
---
fireproof perk plus dense armor allows u take 0 damage from the ranged attacks of scortched beasts and the queen. Just saying.
---
Fellas fellas fellas..... Take this as your lesson to never pre ordering a new game on a AAA company. Pre orders do everyone in the long  run a disservice. It doesn't matter how "their" track record is , or whether it's your absolute favorite type of game / lore . Please no more pre ordering. There's no rush to get a game . I will admit it took me a few years to learn this of getting burnt . But it has been maybe 2 years since I've pre ordered anything , / paid full price. They need to be made to go back to the basics. In which I mean , people only buying he game after launch if it is good.. Not the masses pre ordering a game because they showed you some videos of finely tuned game play that suckered you in. Every AAA company will do this now days. So please I ask , no I beg , don't pre order another game by a AAA company, they certainly do no need it , nor deserve. FYI , got the game from a mate who payed 14$aud. for the keys. For 14$ . I have no complaints. It is what it is. 
---
Which is compounded by the fact that weapon plans are only useful for low levels since higher levels will be using legendaries instead...
---
YOUR MOMS HOUSE!!!!!!
---
GOT EM
---
Ya you're exactly right. 
---
"Honey beasts are giant mutated bees, they are venerable to fire and cryo attacks."
---
132 physical resistance, 150 energy resistance
---
Riiight, if an enemy specifically said to be venerable to energy weapons is more resistant to energy weapons than normal weapons at a base level, ignoring the fact armor piercing doesn't effect energy damage, and the fact that damage resistance is based on the ratio of damage to defence, and that energy weapons have a lower damage than their physical counterparts making resistance effect them more, sure.
---
It feels like nobody at Bethesda knows how armor works in their game, the way it implicitly effects weapon balance, and why just loading every enemy with resistances like a second health bar is a terrible idea.
---
That few days old post with a lvl 1 guy who loved this game was gold.
---
Nice! How often does it get rekd?
---
What about games that came out in 2018? Are there any you would recommend as better video games?
---
At least let us move a point AND pick a card at each level.  After playing a while one of the fun things to do is try weapons you'd never normally use. But it's a 30 level journey to respect and get the cards to do that.. 
---
Great...
---
I've run into some bad crashing from targeting HUD and had a quest container eat a few thousand bullets and 2 pieces of power armor. I found some TSE weapons prenerf but sold them because I knew they'd be nearly worthless now. Lol I see people asking 2.5k for tse today .... Hahaha. 
---
Perk cards are not and should not be at fault in any balance issues. Perk cards are what we use to build any build. If someone finds a way to increase/ decrease damage via items in conjunction with perk cards then those items need to be addressed not the cards. If in the near future a new item is introduced and again it enhances the perk cards what then? Nerf the card or nerf the item? Why should the building blocks of our builds change to suit balances of the game?
---
This is exactly like listening to an anti-vaxxer's logic train on why their unvaccinated child isn't hurting anyone else's. Doesn't have the maturity to even bother trying to see the bigger picture of their actions.
---
Man I know youre right but I keep thinking I'm gonna play it again at some point and do not want to go through that first update again. 
---
Tbf some people actually stream for a living
---
I mean you could just play another game.
---
I haven't looked in about 2 weeks roughly, got all the outfits exc from him...though now that I think about it I probably should see if he has any plans worth picking up

Did you... Did you pacify her? 
---
New Vegas, Baby!!
---
I’m just going to ruin your whole entire post right here and now. I’m casual. I’ve played maybe 100 hours total.... the game is ass. It’s trash. I uninstalled weeks ago and I’ve been following this sub to watch the ship sink. It’s not just the try hardship. It’s the casuals too. Think again. 
---
I just still amazed that they literally admitted that they couldn't get their shit together correctly.
---
ya, that's the main reason I'm eager to see how Outerworld is. These are the guys who brought up the best Fallout to date!
---
Lol.  See my man.  I'm allowed to share an opinion.  Just like you.  And you are literally ruining your day because you think I need to have answers.
---
So let's stick to facts versus creative Made untrue remarks.
---
Concrete numbers around playing.  The point of the matter is if Bethesda was being hurt that badly they would be in damage control.  They're not. This suggests your argument on 4k is crap.  Don't bring up them deleting comments it's not about that.  Simple answer.  Walk away and boycot.
---
You want me to tell you what platform to use.  Guess what?  As I said before.  Maybe it is, but clearly establishing a way to "rally the troops"  to reach out to a more widespread audience should be your goal.  I don't have to tell you that.  That's what people due when a small sample size of people offer for ideas 
---
Ultimately you thinking boycotting a company has zero affect but the last I checked if you can organize a big enough boycott the company responds.  In your description it doesn't work at all and I should play in traffic.
---
I feel sorry for individuals whom feel like they must bully and offend users who simply disagree it's a problem.  Holding on to that last thread that everything is going to be okay and we should all be sheep and follow suit.
---
Unfortunately the reality is that I'm not a sheep and you're the diseased animal struggling to hang onto life because I don't get herded.
---
I'm also allowed an opinion and I'm also allowed to defend it.   I'm also going to identify for the final time you can ignore and move on.  
---
It's unfortunate that even a discussion can it be civil because you charactisically acted like a immature and angry child.  For that I feel bad.
---
Honestly and with all due respect.. Fuck knows.  If they merged the right code streams then dozens of things, but the patch notes mention two feeble things only. 
---
Not a game per se, but shitposting on reddit is quite fun. 
---
There's a subreddit for camps if that's what your talking about
---
I'm hella late, but the community discussions about the state of the game and how shit they are never get addressed by the community manager it seems. Every other post is thanks, we will look into it, or great idea wait till you see what we have planned. But anything like this is just crickets. 
---
You forgot the most important step:
---
Unsubscribe and stop bitching on this sub.
---
No one cares.
---
It’s why they’re not releasing numbers. Meanwhile games with healthy active player numbers like Fortnite or *fill-in-the-blank* will proudly shout about how many people are playing their game... But not a peep from EA or Bethesda
---
That's likely. Maybe they'll throw in a holotape. Or a dead raider that's only good if you're farming tin cans or radroach meat.
---
That's 55lbs of explosive vent plans ...
---
3 things.  
---
bobby pin wt.
---
bulk items scrap from inventory
---
and ??????ugh! i forget already.  go look it up.
---
I see your point but this post contributes to all the trash posts 
---
Anti armor is a great affix for shotties because they lack a perk for it.
---
I'm sure you could add vats to shotgun too. I ran one for a bit because it has crit bar fills faster but it melted all the same albeit at short range
---
Also, we recognize that this caused a problem. Enjoy the nerf while we take a month or two to balance the added cost out.
---
Please fire the dipshits working for you and get someone who knows what the hell they are doing Bethesda! Who cares about longevity this sort of thing will put you under.
---
I guess you never experienced the stuck in power armor forever bug. That was game breaking, and fixed. One fix isn't going to solve the "myriad of problems". A lot of fixes are. What a silly way to word that to try it make it look like they haven't fixed anything. 
---
Obviously the game was released too early. Still, to try to say it hasn't been improved is being extremely dishonest. They haven't taken any "steps back" as far as bugs go. They've consistently fixed them. They borked one patch, yeah, and it's already fixed/being fixed.
---
Not preposterous. Play the game and you’ll see the loads of people running Explosive guns . It’s funny they when you trade with them, it’s a Two Shot Hardened Pump Action......
---
Ask for patience or ask for money not both 
---
Great idea, not sure why I even still had it installed.
---
No sarcasm, sadly... there are still people like this. Not that much anymore, but still... exaggerated positivity towards a company who is screwing their player base. But here we are, getting called „hater“ and „crybaby“ for stating the obvious. 
---
Thank you for heads up
---
Well has anyone checked whether the hacking/robotics expert perk works like the taming/animal friend
---
Until someone decides to blow it up with an TSE shotty. (That happened to me)
---
Looks great though!
---
Yes!!!  Really Really Annoying.  Drains AP and Prevents fast travel.
---
We really going to compare fallout 5 and fallout 76 as if mtiplayer games should have the same level of content or dlc cycles? 
---
I know that. But they also said that they acquired Bethesda Austin for the primary purpose of building FO76.
---
I think what really happened is that Bethesda's main studio built the game world, then gave it to the new studio to build the online gameplay. That's why the game world is really detailed and well done, while the rest of the game is so buggy.
---
Wow thanks, I never tried that on my mobile till now, never realised how well it works! 
---
lol. had a similar encounter today at pheonix in watoga. i did the watoga run and he was still shopping. i literally server hopped cuz i came to the assumption that he was afk.
---
Loads are better video games. But depending on what part of Fallout 76 you enjoy the recommendation will be different. If you're just asking for a game identical in content to Fallout 76 but better then you're out of luck, same as if you wanted a better but the same recommendation for any game.
---
They already did that since day 1... that’s why it’s been nothing but shit since launch
---
Thankfully hasn’t yet! Albeit only a few days old haha 
---
I had something similar happen to me when I purchased T51b calibrated shocks plans. They actually ended up being at the end of my notes, not with the ones that are "known". Double check your notes again. It's probably there, just hard to spot.
---
what jrpg is that? dragon quest? or any other you know?
---
This game has less than 400,000 active players left on all platforms so no, actually, you are full of bullshit. 171,000 people is a really big deal. 42.75% of the playerbase kind of a big deal.
---
Better is subjective.
---
RE2 is looking amazing but if 300 hours here is bad then 6-8 hour playthroughs on RE2 are the devil.
---
As for survival lite games most others are shit

The game has only improved? What about the nerfs to TSE and multiple perks that have caused many people to change their entire play style? What about people getting banned for duping after this patch whose only offense was crafting weapons to scrap for mods? And let’s assume for a moment that what you said about Reddit being a tiny fraction of the playerbase is true(it isn’t). Why would bethesda devote time and people(community managers) to provide input on r/fo76? If it is truly insignificant, they would not even bother using this website at all, they would stick to their own forums.
---
Honestly? Farming the queen is turning into my primary source of caps now that half of all cap stashes aren't even searchable.
---
Junk types that cannot be bulked can be sold unbulked. For example gold, screws, silver, circuitry abd fibre optics. There are more I just can't Renner them off the top of my head
---
You need pyrotechnics and lights! Fireworks and lasers! I recommend autogrenade launcher Gatling plasma and lots of grenades.
---
What about the 3-effect legendary weapons and armor it drops? A lot of people need new weapons now that explosive and two-shot guns no longer get the job done. Most people can only carry a select few weapons because of weight limitations, and now they need to find replacements. What about new players just starting to break in to high-level play, or people who made new characters? People weren't fighting it for ultracite plans anyway. It was also a good way to make caps, what with currency scarcity being what it is in 76...
---
?
---
It was specific to the job we were talking about Rubble, keep up man. Working at Bethesda will never be that stressful (if your in sound mind aka no social anxiety etc) 
---
I didn’t want to start any discussion about being a marine so I don’t know where you got that from, I was forming a point of view of the range of stress from Bethesda to war. As much as you would like for me to be so closed minded and “decided civvie stress is immaterial” you got me all wrong bud. Please take a step back with me, look at the spectrum of stress and tell me that when looking from Bethesda programming  to war that it’s easy to see how easy it is to over play the amount of stress you will actually be in while working there.
---
On the $60, i don't consider it insignificant in terms of money. I appreciate your response and just felt like I needed to clarify here. I literally meant "this upset over", the level of your characters and the fact that you're even still playing the game means you've put some time and effort into this game. I'm not rich either, but it's the idea that $60 could affect your life that much. Maybe i'm just at the acceptance stage, I know I hyped this game up way too much in my head, that's why i'm still here. I honestly couldn't see myself giving many other games this much benefit of the doubt. 
---
Maybe the zealots just really need it to be a good game, and they're willing accept it for what it is and want to try and give it positive place to grow from. 
---
Always been a thing
---
Sort by value
---
Anything in junk with a value above zero can be vendored loose
---
I with you on this. I have no issues with the atom shop or any game selling cosmetic items. That being said I haven't bought anything from there as skins and such is not really my thing. But anyone that likes that to each their own. 
---
It's when games start selling random loot  boxes with a chance to get items/rewards or extra bonus that annoy me. Its basically gambling and can be easy to get people hooked. Just have a look at any of the ultimate team modes in the EA sports games, people spend hundreds/thousands of dollars in packs to try and get lucky. They release better cards each week to try and get people to buy more for the next best card.
---
I'm happy bethesda said they are not going that route and hope they stand by it. If they change their mind I'd be done in a second. (But I guess it wouldn't matter cause they have my money and I have no plans on spending more.)
---
I was saying it was shite after the first xbox 2 hour beta session. I didn't have one negative experience yet, I just felt like they were hiding something.

Just some ideas. Ill add more if people comment or I remember some more
---
It’s only auto scrap if you scrap all and your carrying bulk on your character 
---
Why would you carry bulk items on your character? 
---
That's always been the case. Screws, solver, gold, antiseptic, and a few others are sold loose, and don't actually have a bulk option. 
---
Well I'm overencumbered, can't sprint, but can fast travel! On xbox... 
---
how about when you are in an area and everything just drops dead out of no where. last time i was in the military wing in the bunker and it happened. next thing you hear is new mr gutsys entering rooms and seeing the others dead and saying “what the hell happened here!”  jave had it happen with other enemys too.
---
Mine fixed after re-installing, but I only use that as a last-ditch effort since download times. I don’t know if there any possible fixes besides that.
---
West Virginia football. They're close to being good, but... no

Lmao. How is me buying the lamp with a fish in it hurting you exactly? Wow, you're actually comparing cosmetic micro-transactions, the most benign form of micro-transactions by the way, to people that actively and ignorantly endanger *the lives* of their children and other children around them. I'm sorry but that is just a flat-out stupid comparison. 
---
its like $27

i build HUGE structures.  then have no budget left to decorate the interior.

please give me more budget!!

Fallout 4. Started a new game and it was a breath of fresh air.
---
I recently dumped all my known plans to someone. It was a couple of hours ago.
---
My bad, I read it as you saying BGS Austin was acquired to build FO76 (alone), not as you saying BGS Austin was acquired to build FO76 alongside existing resource.
---
Just to be clear, I wasn't arguing the nerf or the balance. I'm arguing for my points back. I spent 5 into demo and I'd like to get them back because it was nerfed and now I'm not playing playing demo because of that nerf.  If I want to put 5 points right back into the nerfed perk, that should be up to me. 
---
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
I still love fallout but I’m waiting for Anthem to come out. That’s when I’ll be switching. 
---
you speak as if most people who buy remasters can play their previous copies. I buy remasters because i cant play my old copies of games without purchasing new game systems. 
---
Also yes the difference is big but the same logic is still there. I dont understand excusing one business practice just for being optional when the other one is too. I think there is a lot more that goes into remasters being bad business practices (when not done respectfully) than them being optional.
---
In terms of online games, Eve online, if you like the gameplay.  They have gone through over a decade of learning curve and made all the mistakes and learnt from them. They constantly engage with their player base, give thorough details about the game, and it's been ages since they last produced a patch that overwrites boot.ini and kills Windows. (Am not joking) 
---
I laughed so hard. Thank you for blessing us with this. Nice to see a little humor floating around in this subreddit.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
They were by far the most powerful build and was in need of a nerf when I played
---
While I don't work for ZeniMax/Bethesda, I do work in the MMO LiveOps space (*well, used to -- looking for a new job now!*).
---
Some people have come close to describing the alternative methods of the word "hot" here -- and I bet some components on the server are updated while live without much public fanfare -- but I believe an alternative use of the terminology *might* be due to the method the "new" patch is created. Again, while I can't be 100% sure in FO76's case nor do I claim to say anything on their behalf, we used the term at my last job when we bypassed the traditional build creation pipeline. Often, creating a new game build requires a several hour process were the new changes are pulled from source control, collocated, and re-complied into new executables. And that's before QA even get's their hands on it for several hours. Although when time is of the essence, and when technology allows (based on the type of change, the engine and tools available, etc.), a "mini-build" can be created by re-building only the affected files such as data tables, UI, or scripting instead of actual C++ code (you'd be surprised by how much of the game is actually just data and scripting). Once this is created, it then has to go through QA testing for regressions (which can take time) and then staged to the live servers and CDN (which can take time, as well). On top of deployment, Bethesda might also do live testing before opening the servers to ensure the promised changes took affect. 
---
So again, while hot doesn't mean zero downtime, it can be an extremely abbreviated process compared to a normal patch that might be "in development" for several days before players see it.
---
But with game development you can hire people with experience so you don't make a bunch of obvious mistakes. Many jobs require experienced people from the start, and sometimes that's for good reason. Bethesda really was not prepared to make an online game, and it's kind of odd they didn't realize neither their usual game design or the engine they use would work well with it.
---
The only way I'd buy Fallout76 is if it became offline and it was at a deep discount, since personally I don't care about quests in Bethesda games so I'd be fine grinding and settlement building which I guess you can do in 76 but I'm not interested in the online aspect and would want mods to fix the usual Bethesda failures regarding user interface, optimization, basic aesthetic stuff like decent looking lighting and so on. 
---
Thought it was going to be a "stop complaining" thread.
---
Ended up being really helpful, so thank you dude, I'll do it as soon as I can, I'm disappointed with this game too
---
That is duped stuff
---
Maybe wait more than a couple hours after the hotfix? They aren't really known for instant communication. 
---
7 Days to Die... which is like+ years old and still in alpha state...but...it's pretty fun...but I'm still holding out for 76
---
ANY NPC would be nice.
---
My level 12 character that I've only put 10-12 hours into could buy them (I think she's sitting on ~1,200 caps), but I don't see any reason to. Low level scorched all carry hunting rifles, 10mm, and pump shotguns, and I've scrapped so many just to stay underweight that I've probably learned 90% of the mods for those guns already.
---
It would be cool if the had hub servers for trading only. Maybe hold 100 people instead of 20. Basically just a walled in town you cant leave so there would be minimal stress on the server? Idk
---
You can always have a full team of people wearing mistress of mystery outfits j/s. 
---
Explain why I should give a shit
---
&gt; I was forming a point of view of the range of stress from Bethesda to war.
---
Why? If someone offered you a choice between a slap in the face and a punch in the gut would you say 'Well compared to being shot in the leg they are the same so who cares'?
---
As I said, relative stress. Why would I get a job at Bethesda that causes more stress for the same reward than at another company? Because some army guy told me that neither is as bad as getting deployed to a dusty hellhole?
---
lol, if ya like it that much, up vote me!!  (wink, wink!)
---
It's a feature!  *Snipes op*  Bethesda can never know!
---
Fallout 3, 4 or New Vegas.
---
I'm *really* attached to Bethesda's style of video games, so it's hard for me to find games that I would say are "better" than 76 that have come out recently. I haven't openly proclaimed my dissastisfaction with the state of the game right now, but I have pretty much stopped playing for the time being. I've been playing some Far Cry 5, Dying Light, and a few others...but honestly, I can't get that into them. This patch was *kind of* the last straw for me, but at lvl 110 and pretty much geared out with what I want, there isn't much left for me to play. Grind some stuff to sell daily cap limit, farm Watoga for legendaries. I need new content, but I realize they have to fix the core game first. I think I just played too much and burnt out. Geez, I got a bit sidetracked there! :P
---
Also what about an indicator telling the player which power armor suit you are looking at in storage.its annoying and time consuming figuring out which suit you are trying to use.FIX THIS why do I even have to ask?
---
K bye.
---
You said something intelligent and get downvoted by trolls lovely
---
I've had my entire workshop prevent me from building any new items. I moved camps multiple times but the only thing I can place is my already stored items. The bug also dupes some of my stored items at random but I couldn't run wire. I'm still not sure if this bug is fixed, because it this bug was the final straw. https://imgur.com/a/PTbMl84
---
My friend convinced me to get the game on launch aswell. Played until i hit lvl 85, then got bored. He only played until lvl 22 or so then gave up. 
---
Womp womp
---
Feels bad but I saw this coming from a mile away. Personally I feel like enemies are too spongey but I know it’ll be fixed down the road. 
---
How did america make jetpacks before nuked flora?  We will never know....
---
Which were?
---
lol, that's how I felt up until this last patch
---
I believe you about the damage being all f**ed up and have the same mutations issues, but I doubt you are being killed by level 10 Scorched. If you need to exaggerate you should at least make it believeable. I have a One and a Quarter shot automatic plasma rifle that does 33 damage and can fairly easily kill a level 10 Scorched, so... yeah.
---
Underwater vault. I want a use for the "breathe under water" affix.
---
Great feature, but can i get back the \~200 plastic i wasted  (refunding plastic, why not?!) on this bug in Harpers (got a horde of Mutants in front as usual, so i scrapped their loot ack at the Alchemy desk before meeting the vendor. Found at out in that shamed moment i have barely anything left to sell anymore. Except some awesomely weightless Bobby pins (thanks fro that Bethesda - no pun intended). Neither plastic to bulk it again.
---
I propose to get back the plastic \*too\* when unscapping bulk - and simply for the entertainment...
---
Would like to see what comes out the not announced hotfix the quickly released hotfix of the patch. I'd also propose to let the community add version numbers - Im' sure they are better increasin/decreasing the major version numbers, so Bethesda can also focus on the Build numbres. Win-Win.
---
Man, I'm full off "great" ideas..
---
More a practical question, how to process if i do junk runs often and bulk them to be able to sell whenever around one? Don't bulk, only strictly before the vendor? Or dump them temporary?
---
If not sellable, at least allow ammo to be scrapable so we can convert that .38 into some usable lead and gunpowder.
---
Get Resident Evil 2. It’s as great as everyone is saying it is. 
---
This is good for Bethesdacoin
---
Same happened to me. I ended up giving to a low level. 
---
Fo76 is the first fo game to have it.
---
I'm happy we got anything

Resident evil 2
---
This could be something new, I havent played the game much at all the the past two weeks and after this patch I decided to uninstall the game.
---
What is this sorcery? I need to know about this sub
---
You don’t just give your newborn to a toddler for babysitting! 
---
Real flash and razzle-dazzle stuff then. Great suggestion! Going explosive and perhaps melee takes me away from my current character's science-based weaponry (Gauss Rifle + Tesla Shotgun) and into anew, interesting direction.
---
Also, you've gotten me imagining a central C.A.M.P. component being the artillery piece, just waiting to launch someone!
---
Fallout fanboy here. Still waiting... creeping the the subreddit hoping this year they clean it up. I remember ESO being a bit rocky at first. Praying this is the same deal and they iron shit out. Until then I'll wait but I will remain optimistic.
---
But... what if I just want the controller? Can they trade the game in after buying the controller &amp; technically get a discount on the controller?
---
Still a nice fortress! No one needs to know it’s empty haha 
---
The armor system in this game dramatically favors burst damage to an almost comical degree.
---
The ratio of damage to armor determines final damage, and as all enemies have a ton of armor any weapon dealing less than 200 damage per shot is going to be heavily gimped in terms of damage, not 20, TWO HUNDRED is the critical mass where a weapon's damage starts taking a heavy drop against enemy armor, weapons like the minigun are straight terrible, having their damage reduced by a factor of around 7, while a super sledge in it's base form is dealing around a third of it's damage, but with perks can easily reach the point where it does the majority of the actual damage listed while the minigun almost crawls to 1/4.
---
I did the math, against 100 armor a gatling gun needs only 25 bullets to out-damage a minigun's full 500, that is how big a difference 79 damage makes against 14, a factor of 20 rounds to one for a damage difference of 7.5.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
There is a handy chart at the side that shows how shafted a low damage weapon gets, with a 25 damage weapon suffering a 70% loss of damage against a target where a 250 damage weapon only loses 30%, meaning the 25 damage weapon has to hit &gt;23 times to do the same damage, and a 10 damage weapon has to hit 80 times, dealing a theoretical 800 damage to match 250.
---
ALPHA is king
---
Edit, food for though, a high level super mutant has 178 armor, so when I say 100 armor, I'm talking mid game trash here or assuming you have decent armor piercing.
---
Armor needs a rework in this game, badly, or at the very least the devs need to understand what armor means for weapon balance. They give higher level enemies more and more armor like a second health bar, making them exponentially stronger and demanding higher and higher alpha strike damage to overcome these higher and higher resistances, if all guns did the same damage per shot this wouldn't matter, but there are weapons like the minigun that struggle against the armor of level 10 enemies but can't be acquired before level 35, as if it is supposed to scratch even lightly armored end game threats, lightly armored in this context being 100 or so armor on the shirtless scorched who are the lowest armor enemies at any particular level, super mutants approach 200 armor, and some of the top end enemies can close in on 300 armor at the top end. Remember, 14 armor is all that is needed to cut a minigun's damage in half.
---
My reply got auto deleted because I had not been on this site 24 hrs yet.
---
So I will repost: Fallout76 on a PS4
---
after several days of sever hopping, I had most of the X-01 mods worth having. They included the jet pack, stealth boy, and calibrated shocks. After finally getting the calibrations shocks, I decided to install the mods the next day when I was fresh. In the mean time I was making ammo and I ran out of steel. Guess what, fallout76 ate by mods. Not sure why. I am guessing it had something to do with running out of steel.
---
Anyway, I made a ticket asking for my mods to be replaced. I haven’t heard back yet, and probably never will.
---
A word of advice, don’t do any thing until you’re mods are installed.
---
Wait I'll just get it for you
---
I really appreciated when I was near some low level guy's workshop, and came over to help him defend the waves. Then at one point, I started getting a bounty for every time one of the attacking bots shot one if his turrets. That was awesome.
---
Ahhh a sight to be seen!
---
&gt; Why would you carry bulk items on your character?
---
Don't you trundle your excess materials off to the nearest train station to exchange for ... (say it with me in the protectron voice now) ***CAPS***?
---
&gt;Obviously, you've made the choice to not hold out hope for this ship to stop sinking. That's your prerogative. I, on the other hand, don't see the purpose of abandoning the ship as it takes continues to take on water that have been made due to a bad first collision with an iceburg.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
I'm going to bail to play Resident Evil 2, Kingdom Hearts 3, and Smash Bros Ultimate. You know, games that were released polished. Oh, and Monster Hunter World that actually continues to add awesome stuff instead of reintroducing bugs.
---
Now that I spell it out for you, I feel less animosity and a lot more sympathy. I now honestly hope you get out of it while you still can. Don't wait to drown.
---
That's 10hrs per day for 76 straight days. What big streamers that actually the pull the necessary subs and donations for make that a feasible living play fo76? That's not including post production time if you were also uploading to YT. 
---
Keep the tears flowing
---
Been using this for a while, quite handy.

&gt; Lol. See my man. I'm allowed to share an opinion. Just like you. And you are literally ruining your day because you think I need to have answers.

I work a super boring job until 11PM, I'm not ruining my day by waiting for your answers, I'm just bored af. You have the power to stop replying, but apparently you're just as bored as I am.   
---
&gt; Concrete numbers around playing. The point of the matter is if Bethesda was being hurt that badly they would be in damage control. They're not. This suggests your argument on 4k is crap. Don't bring up them deleting comments it's not about that. Simple answer. Walk away and boycot. 
---
I've already walked away and boycotted them. I uninstalled the game, maybe two months ago? This post came up on my Reddit as "Currently Trending", so I came to check it out and saw you spewing that shit out of your mouth. Don't bring up negative things they've done though? Whut? There are plenty of reasons for every "True" Bethesda fan to walk away from this game, actually surprised more of you haven't.   
---
&gt; You want me to tell you what platform to use. Guess what? As I said before. Maybe it is, but clearly establishing a way to "rally the troops" to reach out to a more widespread audience should be your goal. I don't have to tell you that. That's what people due when a small sample size of people offer for ideas 
---
You do know that Reddit themselves call themselves the, "Front Page of the Internet". And dozens of stories and posts about Fallout 76 have straight up been plagiarized by news companies or picked up by them. Kotaku has done it along with other Video Game "News" Sites. So yet again, you just prove your more stupid than you are new.   
---
&gt; Ultimately you thinking boycotting a company has zero affect but the last I checked if you can organize a big enough boycott the company responds. In your description it doesn't work at all and I should play in traffic. 
---
We would totally be able to, if it weren't for idiots like you and the other 1/4 of players who downvote and post shit like, "I'm still having fun!" It's not about ***THEIR*** fun. It's about everyone's **FUN.**  
---
&gt; I feel sorry for individuals whom feel like they must bully and offend users who simply disagree it's a problem. Holding on to that last thread that everything is going to be okay and we should all be sheep and follow suit. 
---
I'm just an abrasive asshole, I don't care if people want to play Fallout 76 anymore. The game has literally been uninstalled on my XB1 for almost a month, I just like watching the sinking ship burn. And since I don't follow this subreddit anymore, I have even less of a reason to be nice and accepting.   
---
&gt; I'm also allowed an opinion and I'm also allowed to defend it. I'm also going to identify for the final time you can ignore and move on. 
---
I would I ignore a troll that brings nothing to the table and continues to respond like he has the answer from the pedestal he's on top of? You could have just as easily ignored this thread, but you didn't. So why should I ignore your comments?   
---
&gt; It's unfortunate that even a discussion can it be civil because you charactisically acted like a immature and angry child. For that I feel bad. 
---
I asked you twice before, what would be a better way to "gripe", yet you gave no answers of any kind. You actually said, "I don't know." So I mean it can't be civil, because you're a fucking idiot that doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about- And instead of coming to that understanding and not saying anything, you opened your mouth- Presumably because you thought you could get Karma out of it- And went for some, "Well if you don't like it don't play it" type responses.   
---
You're the type of person who makes these games and discussions like these absolute fucking shit.   
---
You and people like you are the bane of the gaming community. 
---
I bet he was playing you: waiting for you to slap him so he could kill you.  No coincidence he suddenly saw the mutie.
---
Woah that's a big conclusion to jump to! But nah he just needs a push imo. He's done similar with me for other games and usually he's right that I'll like it
---
I remember that patch, I escaped it being on Windows Vista for ever.
---
Seeing how they put out patch notes before they would have certainly but it in there.
---
I’m willing to bet an obscene amount of money that neither of us probably have, that it’s either gonna get worse or not fix anything really... you down?
---
Ok deleting
---
To sell them at vendors if/when they have caps available. This is the first time they’ve been included in autoscrap. 
---
No shit right? But not just me. Uninstall metrics are useless to the Xbox because im not the only person with this low of a hard drive. The OP is assuming ununstall metrics matter when i presented a scenario that it doesn't matter. Instead of debating the point i got a bunch of shopping lists. Thanks for kind of getting the point 
---
I spent a total of 370$ on 2 copies of the game pre-release one for me and 1 for my wife and neither of us can stand it. I definitely felt betrayed... and I tried to get into it. 25 hours grinding away on a game that can't draw me in.... I don't see myself ever preordering bethesda again.
---
Oh, also for the C.A.M.P., lightboxes, tents, musical instruments, a stage...
---
Thank you!
---
I got it for $5 on Craigslist. 
---
If they had resources to fix it then they’d be making use of those right now, before the game reaches an irreversible tipping point. All Bethesda’s resources are going to the next Elder Scrolls and Starfield; what FO76 has is an inexperienced skeleton crew doing whatever they can. 
---
Bethesda made it clear that they’re never gonna do take-backsies lol
---
Ahh I see makes some kind of sense. Most vendors have stashes close to them tho? Just don’t pull them out till you are ready to sell 
---
Understandably this is Reddit so i don't expect you to believe me when i say i never duped nor do i really care if you do, the truth is every update that comes out ups the amount of grinding in-game. If you don't mind that more power to you but personally that's just not fun to me, most of us grind every day in real life and i play video games for a small break from that. Ultimately all gamers enjoy different things, and small pretty comments like yours add nothing to the conversation.
---
How about substantial evidence that the person is guilty instead. *Especially* when you consider how incompetent Bethesda has been about every aspect of this production - the game, the patches, the community, the merch, the $20 skins.
---
Bethesda doesn't get the benefit of the doubt, *the consumers do*
---
This should be required reading for this subreddit. 
---
Cool story 
---
Come see the show! It's to die for
---
Crap opinion take it back pls
---
Yeah.  We care a whole lot. 
---
Woohoo! Another point and shoot game... how innovative!...
---
That's a relief. I was worried things had gotten totally out of hand with filtering. Cheers.
---
They're still worth it if you do it right. Build your camp on an acid node (there's dozens) or else capture the Hemlock Holes workshop and have 3 acid accumulators running. 
---
Wait until at least the first DLC comes out.
---
Why do you ask why?
---
This is the post I’ve been waiting for.
---
The point is that the default console hard drive is so small that the metric is useless. Don't let me interrupt the self righteous upvote party over my ad hominem finance conversation though 
---
I see now, You not only want to take the easy route because of a difference of maybe having to work a little harder and get a tiny bit more stress, but you also would rather stay inside your box and claim that because you didn’t experience certain things, they don’t exist for you to compare to. You know what, you stay there my dude. Do nothing and be nothing. I’m out.
---
I concur

Just a heads up, I posted this bug (cannot get character to successfully hide, HUD display always shows [caution] at best) after the patch Tuesday.  I am still experiencing it after the “hotfix” today and switching servers did not fix it this time. I just had the bug two logins in a row. 
---
How infuriate are you really?
---
“Big dick swinging one shot shorty badass” LMFAO I love it. It’s way too true.
---
*excuse me,* but didn't we all build our smithing in Skyrim by crafting a million iron daggers???
---
Bethesda fucking *taught* us to play this way.
---
well all I can remember being screwed out of yet is my T-51B left arm I was using it, it broke and disappeared 
---
👎😑👎
---
The issue your having is systemic. Capitalist democratic america thinks this is OK. That is why it
---
Ironically, me too.  I've never finished the game, I get to the point to decide which faction and I just can't lol.  I think it's time to make a master save and just do all three at once.
---
I really am sorry for you. That is alot of money and I would be pissed. 
---
This is the best answer. I never have an issue finding stuff to sell to vendors, so I don't need the money. What I do need is a way to convert all the .38, .45, and fusion cells into something useful rather than just dropping them in a paper bag.
---
Your circle jerking is boring "bro."
---
Lol you guys are so dramatic.  I mean... I get it the game isn't great but , holy crap.
---
Out of 171k how many are the big dick swinging level 200 minority.....
---
About a 5% chance in my experience.  I won’t grind, but i always swing by when i am in the neighborhood.
---
You can also see the pied piper and the dogwalker, plus two un-useful respoderbots.
---
And the point was never missed, don’t let our massive HDD space interrupt your sulking. /s
---
I am still hung up on you selling screws.
---
Not true for me. I have an AA lever action and a TS, 33% VATS accuracy, 15%crit lever action and I just did a queen earlier. Close up enemies I was hitting 95% shots reliably with the TS. Things at long range, even if if was 95% (and I run 3/3 concentrated fire), I wasn’t hitting nearly as reliably. My AA had no issue. 
---
Yeah I have a double barrel with faster crit meter fill and crit heals I might test out again, thanks again 
---
I think they took it down cause the guy had to pop like 7 chems to get his damage above 50.
---
Maybe they wanted to make another Fallout game using the same engine and thought the only way to make it different enough from FO4 was to make it multi-player. 
---
Damn, I kind of expected this to at least generate some discussion, but just downvotes and silence huh? Okay. 
---
You got me wondering now. I'll have to double check. If its the one I'm thinking of it has a male and female mannequin unclothed facing each other from opposite ends of a circle formed by 4 of them and the other two are kinda on the side as if they're watching and waiting? I jokingly call it the intro to naked and afraid
---
I just play it like a normal fallout game. I’ve found that a lot of criticisms about the game are blown out of proportion, especially on Reddit. The game definitely has problems, just like any other Bethesda game, but it hasn’t affected how much fun I’ve had with it.
---

Sadness 💔
---
Minecraft obviously 
---
they only delete shit posts, try to make yours seem more sincere and maybe yours won't be.
---
There is rumored to be one in QA....
---
Uninstalled game and launcher. I'm doing my part!
---
I don't remember him mentioning anything about the buffout syringe that's written on the blackboard, I might be wrong tho.
---
Sadly I think players make up their own game, it's like, cmon Bethesda this would be cool, please make it so ..err...no. like nuking a behemoth, people are desperately looking for hidden game content that doesn't exist.
---
The same logic is not there at all.  You don't have your copy available.  You would have the content if you kept track of the game.  You don't have to purchase any game more than once to enjoy it (otherwise it is a bad business practice), you have to purchase lootboxes to enjoy what's inside them (generally) though.  Those are leagues apart from one another.  Bad business practices are practices that intend to prey on the consumer and make money from it, not just from making money.  Remasters aren't, in my opinion, bad because you either already own (or owned) the game and can continue playing (provided you kept track of your copy) if you so choose or you never owned the game in the first place.  If, however, a company designed the original copy to degrade to the point where the only way to continue using your original purchase was through a remaster, that would be a bad business practice.  A remaster is just as bad as making you repurchase a game that you broke or lost.  It isn't bad business practice because replacing your current copy is completely optional.
---
It's not like they don't have the tools to actually test their own products, that is part of the reason the dev rooms exist.  All they have to do is USE them.   
---
I would rather wait a week or two more for an update, if it allows me to be assured that it will actually help, not break more crap.
---
It’s work as intended. Don’t you see ? They just want you to grind. It’s in every updates. More food/water needed, more repair frequency and materials, lower damage to use more ammo, prices of vendors and caps cap limit. 
---
Bulk items and mods probably had the same tag on them already and they just changed how the tag interacts with auto-scrap mechanics.
---
Lazy and shortsighted are the two best descriptions for their method of fixing things if you look at the battle against duping.
---
Thanks for the lesson on the specifics, it's good to know the actual numbers.  I have used the gatling gun and it's frankly the only reason to have 5mm right now.  I often wish I had some mods for it.  
---
When it comes to heavy weapons I'm always looking out for armor piercing legendary.  I think it's the thing that could potentially make the high fire rate heavy weapons useful, at least in their current form.  
---
Patch notes do indeed say heavy weapons are getting a rework, too.  Sounds like they are going to make them more accessible instead of more effective though.
---
&gt; **it is freedom of speech** 
---
It's not tho.
---
True, could do that (and that’s my workaround now) but it’s an extra tedious step.  Some vendors don’t have the stash right next to them, which means I’ll have to remember to not hit up the autoscrap while making sell runs which is a big ask after a few beers....
---
Paint overrides the VISUAL of the mod. I’m not sure if adding a mod after paint removes the paint, but adding paint after the mod will show the paint visual and damn well should leave the mod alone (that’s how it works in FO4)
---
You are gatekeeping work-related stress behind being in an active warzone. Well guess what, some people actually die in war so don't tell me not dying is stressful. You're here aren't you? So why are you staying inside your box, how stressful can being alive really be? We all know the only real way to be anything is to die a hero.
---
How are you identifying where camps are, just out of curiosity?
---
Oh there is, cause one you finish the main quest line and the small amount of side quests, it gets boring 
---
I used to be.... Now I just see it as they burned their bridge. My wife wanted the power armor edition so we got that... Tricentennial for me but yeah lesson learned. Had Bethesda tried to make it right in any way for all of us.... Which they didn't I might not be so jaded about it. But then we wouldn't be here would we.
---
Freedom of speech does not apply here, that and the mods (AFAIK) are not Bethesda employees
---
if your post violates the rules of the subreddit it can be deleted
---
Or at least let us have a like...load out for one type of build and then if you need to switch, you can go into your inv under “misc’ and it should be like a key or file or something that lets you switch it without having to go and fuck around with the cards.
---
Maybe he forgot the emphasis. It's probably "it *just* works" as in it works, but barely.
---
Yeah I’d actually be pretty annoyed if they went with rng boxes. I hate that shit. 
---
&gt;Either way, that's 7 teams that are never going to live down the shame of losing to the Cleveland Browns.
---
The Detroit Lions are at least happy that the Browns couldn't shame anyone the previous year and got another friend to help celebrate their 10^th anniversary at the "managed to lose every single game in a season we're not even joking" table.
---
I can’t believe people still play this game after everything that’s happened and the state of its release. I mean I haven’t played it so maybe I’m missing something, but it looks like the shittiest game ever. 
---
Casual. People who play the game casually don't go through the effort of looking the game's sub up and participating in bullshit like duping. They mind their own business pacing through the game leisurely while playing a few hours maximum daily. People who have inventories filled with TES are far from casual. 
---
BRAVE
---
... to apply a hotfix.
---
Not next to the Charleston station. People server hop there to get the traveling vendor and it won’t spawn if there’s a camp there. 
---
Personally I think it's a Prometheus/alien Easter egg, especially with those stone heads.
---
ahahah, they already know, its a bug )))
---
I've thought about this and I think it would be great.  When I first did it in WoW I had a lot of fun trying to fish up the rare stuff.
---
I mean, I’ve got mutations but since the update or whatever I’ve been needing water every few minutes. Before the update I could go about a half hour or so without worrying about my food and water. Now I can’t even go 10 min without having to fill both of them up.
---
Fanboys gonna fanboy lol
---
something "GAMERS ARE WAY BETTER THAN THE DESIGN STAFF, WE COULD MAKE THIS GAME IN A NIGHT YOU LAZY ASSHOLES"
---
How about fixing the dupe glitch instead of banning people suspected of abusing it? ...... Wait that would require Bethesda to give a fuck...... Never mind 
---
Yeah, that's a little much. But OP is probably off on that night, not to mention it's an outlier and statistically should be thrown out.
---
Then there all the hours "in game" accumulated just sitting at the login screen which also adds to your total.
---
You just need to prioritise ammo a bit more. Hardcore was tough, but if you make every bullet count (and make good use of combining the gunpowders) then you don’t need to do too much dodging and running. Wait for the aiming reticule to zero in and not only do you get a more accurate shot but (apparently) you also stand a higher chance of a critical hit. You can also sneak past Lickers if you walk very slowly and keep your nerve. 
---
Still dodge and run from Mr X, though, that dude will use you as a toothpick. 
---
This guy may be on to something
---
Good, now carry on!
---
This was more about the other pedant than you, but sure :)
---
It’s just gnarly, man.
---
I just hope Fallout doesn't lose lifetime fans because of problems with FO76. I hate hearing stories like yours. Best of luck fellow vault dweller!

Nothing can stop us.
---
Lol, I have a 2TB HDD and have had storage issues for over a year.
---
This ain't murica lol
---
Would kill to have a pool table that would let you hustle for caps, and do skill checks on each shot. ... Ya dropped a ball there Bethesda... (Pun totally intended) 
---
LPT: Duping will get you banned.
---
Not that this is a complete solution, but if you get a paint job from the atom shop and apply it that suit will have the atom icon next to it. At least that way you know which is which if you carry 2 at once. 
---
Granted though, I do agree with the suggestion. I think they're considering that actually, so hopefully in some future update soon.
---
Then why did you click on this post and reply to him? 
---
CONSULT THE COUNCIL OF HIGH REDDITORS BEFORE YOU CHANGE THE GAME. WE ARE THE SENATE.
---
For the neon letters, if you want to line them up, I have heard that putting one letter, then an X and then a letter overlapping that one and you remove the X theyll be aligned, kinda tricky but in case you want to put the neon letters more tidy
---
"I'll be sure to pass the message along..."
---
Yes I am. Played last night after patch and water just runs out extremely fast now.
---
:/ can’t. Wife plays it. Totally would though.
---
Lol. What's next?
---
They'll fix bulk scrapping and then reloading your weapon will be flagged as illegal modding.
---
I'm an incredibly casual player. I spend most of my time over encumbered and walk everywhere at a fairly slow pace.  
---
I've been playing for over a month and I'm still level 19.  
---
I've figured out how to set down my C.A.M.P. and build a stash but I've no idea how to build some of the sprawling player mansions that I occasionally find.  
---
I've no idea what I'm supposed to do with the workshops I run across and can take over.  
---
I don't really know how to make lots of caps, or even what I should be spending them on.  
---
I've got a few simple weapons that I've modified and enjoy using.  
---
Most of the time I'm just exploring with no real idea what the hell I should be doing.  
---
And I'm loving this game.
---
And to you
---
Yikes.
---
Holy shit move on with you life
---
Ad victorium!
---
Ok thanks! Best answer so far!
---
Even if it worked, nothing. Stash would go over weight and you'd be unable to deposit anything until getting it under weight. I mean look at anyone who had bobby pins stashed when they reverted the weight.
---
Yeah but those instanced enemies. You can only tame animals from a random encounter and they need to be alone. So it needs to be tested under the same parameters. Find a lone robot through a random encounter.
---
THAT'S AN AVAILABLE MOD??
---
That makes sense, looking back on it Bog Town only worked once I had the red rocket sign in the photo
---
The accuracy numbers remain the same, the bullets themselves miss even when the accuracy says it shouldn't. As I said, my TS at 95% chance to hit often misses one or both bullets.
---
I remember getting a free copy of ME 2 with my video card a long time ago.
---
People actually bought this game
---
Oof
---
I have one of those 
---
It does for acid and lead, unless this patch changed that (been playing RE2 so no real desire to load this up the past week).
---
Just wait until the Detroit Lions have to play against the Cleveland Browns. Unless that already happened. You really want to make people's brains hurt? Tell them to imagine a Super Bowl where it's Detroit Lions vs Cleveland Browns.
---
Abandoned bog town workshop has several extractors; also one floor inside the office building was under construction. Has a bunch of paint cans (lead and steel) and concrete bags.
---
Yes .
---
You can just pick them up in a certain order and they are in that order
---
I've been wanting community servers since day 1. This game has a ton of modding potential and the ability to share your customizable world with friends would be amazing.
---
I do agree the modding community can fix up the game, but I believe that should be Bethesda's job, not ours. They are paying a whole dev team to work on this game, they should be able to fix bugs; if not, why are they still hired?
---
A lot of these issues seems to be management related instead of developer. The software has a ton of issues, but it seems management actively ignores them to focus on shiny bells and whistles. Instead of spending a lot of time to restructure PVP, they are instead focused on short term fixes and knee-jerk patches.
---
Developers don't choose to release an Alpha software as a Beta then call it a Release, management does.
---
Yup this sub is dead. Let it die. 
---
lol at you assuming i dont keep track of my copy, as i told you in my comment, no I would have to buy a new system, because guess what? systems break over time and unlike what you said in your comment, no stuff breaking over time isnt inherently bad business practice its just life. 
---
Using your definition, a lot of remasters are bad business practices in the sense that they prey on nostalgia to get people to purchase the games without having put in any work to actually remaster it. It's just a rereleased copy cash grabbing. This is bad business practice.
---
You can argue that consumers should be smarter and you can avoid these business practices pretty easily, it doesnt change the fact that there are a lot of bad business practices in the remaster market.
---
people been asking for that for eons
---
Im all for free speech, but this is there platform to work with. For example you walk into a clothing store and start telling other customers that all their clothing is made in a sweat shop, you sure is hell are getting booted out. Pick you protests and where.
---
This hit me right where it hurt 😥 
---
Yeah me and my friend group were all hyped for a multiplayer fallout and we all enjoyed it a lot at launch, after a while we all just slowly became more and more disappointed with the game, none of us play it rn but I still keep an eye out for any good news around this game (so far I’ve been let down)
---
Hmm hopefully it works then. It'd be nice to have a Mr gutsy.
---
Unequip all weight reduction armor and log out and log back in
---
It's staggering the number of people who claim entitlement to a right they don't understand
---
huh?  can i have some of that green smoke?
---
I wish my internet was fast enough just to reinstall games on a daily basis lol 
---
imagine thinking anyone wanted a nerf to those perk cards though.
---
the casual guy playing the game? you think he wanted his armor to break faster for seemingly no reason?
---
that guy who really loves explosions, he wanted his explosions to suck even more?
---
why would you ever think the nerfs to the perk cards are okay?
---
I've hopped about 25 times since the patch and still not seeing the event anymore. It's been more than a full day since I've done monster mash. Wonder if it's bugged or time gaited? 
---
They don't always list everything. Also, if you think it's a mistake they overlooked, it's just as plausible that it is intended and they overlooked accuracy in the notes. There have been plenty of things changes with patches that are not specifically in the notes.
---
What about your 20 alts/mules?  
---
That’s not accurate. The dragon doesn’t have any legendary effect inherently. it’s like the Tesla rifle or the Shishkabob.
---
Someone probably posted the tooltip for an actual legendary dragon they found.
---
Well to be fair. They don't have much experience with this since modders usually have fixed their games for them in the past. It's a steep learning curve and they're trying their best
---
What games did you work on if you don’t mind me asking 
---
I just roleplay as wasteland Santa.
---
You're a cunt mate
---
And introduce scrap all scrapping all bulk items bug. 
---
I play with other players, hangout with vendors, build, explore, focus on gathering caps, focus on getting junk or otherwise play the game. 
---
I befriended a married couple who invited me to their group whenever they got on. I kind of adopted them and gave them my extra plans and helped on quests / tried to push them in the right direction. Once I got a few TSE I carried them through a bunch of stuff.
---
I second the abundance of sellable goods but with new prices , vendors cap pool should be greater.
---
I’m having a slow cap flow to reach 24 k for one mutation serum , where’s about 12 ? 
---
But most of us have been saying this for months now. Why all of sudden the fanboys realize it’s dogshit? An epiphany?
---
some thing, some thing, darkside!
---
yeah, yeah.  the darkside came to me and ask me to join.  said, "we have cookies!!"  so i went.  guess what....surprise!!  NO COOKIES!!!
---
I have had it stay zoomed when I let go of the mouse button and then I have to click it again to go back to normal. Was wondering if it was a feature but it doesn't always do that.
---
I am seeing something similar. Was leveling with a friend, I would tag stuff (like can't miss, dead center body mass tagging) and my friend would polish them off. Seems like 25% of the time I wouldn't get XP or loot for kill (assuming my shot didn't register) I suppose it could be lag, but I didn't notice any other normal signs I see when the servers are lagging. Platform:  PC
---
Are you quitting the game?
---
Answer wisely.
---
I didn't say it was a single scorched just their level. I was killed by a level one feral with one hit yesterday. My point is they screwed up everything.
---
The word should what their? Irony. 😀
---
The thing is that both those builds subvert the armor system entirely.
---
The first uses flat damage reduction, meaning having 0 armor makes no difference, the latter uses pure damage to render your armor insignificant to protect your tiny health bar.
---
to survive a 1000 damage hit with 300 health requires approximately 3000 armor, that no build in the game can effectively hit, to survive a 3000 hit needs about, and my math may be a bit off here, around 50K armor, because armor is exponentially related to per hit damage, which is why the minigun is trash and melee is King, per hit damage.
---
Not arguing but yes they moderate here
---
While it would be nice...  Bethesda is ignoring the modders, we have a few here on the forums trying to give bethesda fixes, but bethesda is turning a blind eye.  Just like they've refused to implement community patches into their core game code over the years, despite mod authors giving them free licence to do so.
---
Instead of working things out with the mod authors, they just ignore them, and we the customers suffer for it.
---
I bought a system for it
---
At least if you apply paint job you see an Atom on them 
---
Wow, that's a bit of stretch don't you think? You going to compare someone to a murderer next cause they pay for cable?
---
Man, I keep hearing about Subnautica this and Subnautica that... but underwater games scare the shit out of me for some reason. I'll watch the most gory, violent, jump scary horror movies and it doesn't phase me one bit, but seeing that blue water fading into darkness is just too terrifying.
---
did any of these solutions help?
---
That’s unfortunate. If they fix this I’d probably deal with the rest. Ark didn’t upset me unlike most of their fan base.
---
How does that process require scrapping all junk?
---
Spot on. This doesn’t excuse them though.  But those post are getting annoying. 
---
Well it looks like the rubber band is on the other claw!
---
it was the bulk glitch then.  
---
Level 98.

Since the patch every time I step into Fort Defiance I get \[caution\] immediately.  If there are ghouls present most times 5-7 will make their way down to me at the door if I don't immediately move away.  I go into the fort twice a day to farm so I have intimate knowledge of the mechanics in there.  This evening I went in and got \[caution\] immediately, but someone else had cleared all mobs except for 2 cockroaches and about 4(?) sleeping ghouls on a level some people will miss clearing.  Interestingly, I cleared the caution eventually and when I got to the sleeping ghouls I could walk right up to them without going into caution.  Why did I get \[caution\] when I entered if that was the case.
---
The above is how I notice the sneak issues more than anything, but it does seem like mobs are noticing me faster and from further away.  Sometimes I'll except a building and get \[caution\] immediately even if there's nothing nearby.  This happened over the past couple days when I exited Lucky Hole Mine and Watoga Emergency Services among others.

I've been bulking as I reach stash limit to get my junk packaged to sell at the next vendor refresh. Guess I'm going to have to put a lot more thought into inventory management now. :(

Inviting critique from the faceless masses on the Internet... wow.

For what it's worth, I like it. Shows that you put thought and effort into it.

This is the bleeding edge right here.

I lost interest with fallout 4 never bought this game but I watch you guys everyday about how bad the game itself is and how belligerent  bethesda seems to be with its player base , how on earth can ANYONE after this massive nuke continue to even stand with them as a company :s I for one will never buy one of their games just on this note alone. Sorry you guys get put thru this shit 
---
&gt; Tell them to imagine a Super Bowl where it's Detroit Lions vs Cleveland Browns.

Do you want people start looting and rioting? Because I'm pretty sure that exact situation is spelled out in every religious text as the sign of the apocalypse.
---
Fast and vampiric make everything better.
---
Sorry. over my head. 
---
I take back my comment and apologise, you make good points. I do see that the amount of grinding to progress in the game is increasing, the duplication debacle has really got people on edge, me included, I do believe you when you say you never duped, I've never been involved in duping either, just really, what's the point, they are cheating themselves out of important aspects of the game.
---
Having limited time to play would make these patches irksome I can see that, the WhiteNight nerf was my hated part of the patch, I'd only just maxed out the card for my melee build to have grinding for Ballistic Fibre shoved down my throat.
---
Bethesda have made some bad decisions, I can only hope that they take note of the Fallout community (if such a thing really exists) and roll back the worst changes and work fast at balancing  and bug squashing. Peace.
---
I wasnt following development that close when the game was released, but how many patches have regressed the game?
---
Great to hear! Consider putting the items in the overseer box at the overseer camp. Most new players end up there fairly early on and the items should stick around longer than if dropped on the ground.
---
What was eye opening to me was the posts getting angry about Ultracite PA plans being easily accessible now and the realisation that these posts are from players that are farming SBQ without even playing the main quest.
---
Problem is when you have so many problems to begin with its hard to make a quick fix instantly to make everything happen. I uninstalled, but I hope that this series and multiplayer mode can stay alive and evolve into something someday. 
---
What 
---
they are some what lenient here.  at least i can say shit, fuck, piss, all the george carlin words!!
---
got banned from the forums for that.  lmfao!!  so i switched to another computer! ha ha!!
---
shhhh,  do not tell bethesda!!  
---
Too bad by the time they get it to where it should be people will have moved on to a game that was ready when it launched instead of a year after.
---
Final Fantasy 15 had an in-game survey, that asked the player what kind of DLC they would like to play. It was quite wonderful. They should do something akin to that, in my opinion.
---
That’s balancing, and your opinion of that is entirely subjective. Balancing changes are *always* gonna piss someone off. 
---
I’m sure those people will have their band lifted if that’s actually all they were doing. 
---
I didn’t say it was insignificant. I said it’s not an accurate reflection of the entire player base. If you think it is then you’re deluded. Millions of people play this game. This sub is a fraction of that. Previously someone said a stat on PS4 showed a whopping 5% of players had reached level 50. Think about that. The vast majority of players aren’t even level 50 yet. Considering that the average commenter here is over level 50 (it’s either obvious based on their feedback, they openly state it, or they state their hours which are usually quite a lot more than it’d take to hit 50), it’s illogical to assume that this sub is an accurate representation of all players of this game. 
---
That doesn’t mean Bethesda isn’t going to capitalize on getting feedback from what is still a fairly large community for their game. Of course they are. Of course they’ll have a PR presence in one of the most whiny communities. This sub comes up in search results. It only makes sense to have someone that works there showing their presence and receptivity to feedback. 
---
I’ve only found a couple stashes since the patch, and cap collector hasn’t even been available on any of them (neither of the two Whitesprings bunker stashes gave me the option to search)
---
I saw a legendary ghoul, hit him once, he disappeared into thin air.

---
lmfao!!  i KNEW some one was going to acknowledge my grungy socks!!  as soon as i took the pic, i thought, goddamn it!  the socks!
---
This is the hill you'll die on? You stuck with the game for months only to crumble over something most players would have to go out of their way to do? In the list of screw-ups so far, this is pretty insignificant IMO.
---
Ah geez, it's just been one step forward, two steps back throughout the game's lifespan
---
There were three changes.  It is a big leap to think they overlooked listing 1 of 3 fixed as a feature change.
---
They are also on record saying they are trying to list everything.
---
Not very plausible.
---
I too was a Toronto Maple Leafs fan.
---
The funniest part is. Bethesda's reputation has been tarnishes so badly lately. Who do you believe? I still play old Bethesda games but I'm really disappointed in the company and their direction
---
I would also like to fully endorse this product and/or service.
---
Thanks!!
---
What issues? You mean their terms of service? That they themselves hold, and can change? This makes zero sense.
---
There are plenty of trades that make their money by taking on one time contracs. Take software designers, they make their money off one time deals to provide a company with a new image. And then they are done. Its literally that simple. Hell most pf the time they dont get recognized for it either. Yea they can add it to their portfolios, but  you dont see companies flounting around there name saying "they did this for us".
---
Its an afully simple thing, sell mod tools for $200-300, an up front cost to make sure modders are serious about helping. 
---
Make a new page for posted "contracts"
---
Pay per contract a specific amount based on time it would have taken them to fix, bonus if done faster. 
---
Place a new catagory in credits screen to show them off.
---
The only thing that becomes the real issue here os, what if you have too many modders, well you can open it up to a free for all contract, anyone can submit their patch for a bug or issue, but only one gets chosen, this would be determined by who coded the best. 
---
Yes not everyone would make profit, again not the point, not everyone becomes famous for being second best, not every youtiber makes profit. Lots of places are like this. 
---
In the end this can only help the developers, in two ways specifically, this helps free up time to continue adding content and balancing the game. It also allows for them to review and lern from the modders on how to address issues/bugs/glitches ect. The literal best way to learn something is from someone else, you did this for more than 18 years of your life, except you had yours handed to you from a teacher. Yea it would be harder to lern, but quicker and easier than working it out yourself tirelessly and needlessly when option are available to do so better and more efficiently.
---
You got tought in school how to do math by hand, and unless your exceptionally talented and are capable of doing so in your head at break neck speeds, your employer would vastly disapprove of any one doing this. On top of that there are several better opotunities at think tanks that could utilize those skills.
---
So no, there really arent legal or monitery restriction only a lack of motivation and humility that again have stifled what could be great.
---
The way armor and DR/ER work needs totally reworked also.
---
Are you ok?
---
There must be some technical reason for them not changing it that is buried deep, deep in the code. I can't imagine that they are just choosing to ignore it for all this time.
---
A lot of people want something similar to this. Compelling factions that are mutually exclusive help with identity. One of the reasons Harry Potter is so successful is because of the houses. 
---
Which of the mods are Bethesda employees?
---
Stop complaining about every little thing. They released a fox. Be happy about it, you self-entitled boob
---
Holy shit I just found a solution that fixed this problem for me. Maybe it'll help you, too.
---
In the Bethesda launcher, on the Fallout 76 page, in the top right, there's a gear dropdown for options and settings. One of the options is "scan and repair"; click that and let the launcher do its thing. This basically checks all the files in the installation and fixes any that have become corrupted.
---
After doing that, I could once again fast travel as normal.
---
Such is life duh! Jesus!
---
I say jump in, the water is fine.
---
I dont play Fallout 76 but do wish they had made Fallout 5 instead. Offline, the lone wonderer and all that jazz.
---
I don’t have any objective proof of before vs after but I would have to say it seems to be significantly higher thirst rate.
---
Don't mind me just mining some salt
---
It took awhile for the image to load (slow internet) so I saw the socks before the cat. Cat is spooky though!
---
Shouldn't we do as we always do, upvote the posts that we should support and downvote the unhelpful ones?
---
As for the last paragraph, we really need actual devs with some authority to frequent and comment on the sub. CMs can only do so much so they end up with the impotent "we hear you" and "pass it along" comments because that's all they can do.
---
yes to all of this. I tried to make a fallout 76 post in which i defended the update and i was accused of being a top level exec @ bethesda. reddit is full of what i like to call "assholes".
---
welcome to my world.  go Raiders!!
---
Sorry, wasn't trying to be a snarky ass. I really thought it was an exaggeration. I agree. It's all sorts of messed up. That's why I call it a One and a Quarter shot now. 😆
---
There's no way the Suns are as disappointing. 
---
For a good month I couldn't play with the voip on or the audio would cut out entirely so I didn't get bothered by kiddies to much. Then again I'm always crouched so people don't see me that often ether. Since I had to start playing with a headset in order to hear audio since last patch, not many squeakers. Met some really cool folks. One dude gave me a decent gun for a later build. 
---
Lol this guy thinks they’re gonna fix the issues
---
Cap prices have been set relatively high to allow for a market to still exist where players can mod other’s equipment for a cheaper price?  What the what?  Please explain.  If it’s supply and demand that’s effed up logic.  Paying 2,500 caps for a Cryolator that’s junk and isn’t all that rare is asinine. 
---
But why do that when someone is willing to do it for free during their private time? How is Bethesda going to save money paying people to make a game if they can't just rely on free labor?
---
I have heavy doubts on your story. 
---
I wish that Bethesda would do the ole Guild Wars 2 method of calling these liars out with the actual stats/# of items these banned players have on their account.
---
This would eliminate the banned players from being able to lie and start these stupid mobs of sheep shouting about how the game sucks. 
---
Im not a stalker. Ive seen moderated posts relating to how they would like feedback to change the game, so..
---
r/cringe
---
I've played near 200 hours and loved the game, I just want an option to fix the game myself since I've lost faith in Bethesda for the time being unfortunately :(
---
I don't care that the game is online either, just online only will never be moddable 
---
Shit, which answer gives me internet points?
---
Yep, same here. Im only level 22 because I can’t play the game for more than an hour at a time since i have to stop everything im doing to get rid of stuff from my inventory. Absolutely kills the fun of exploring an open world and there’s no excuse since carry weight should be one of the easiest things to fix.
---
Not to mention most of the cool guns i find that should entice me to keep playing don’t matter at all...because i know I’ll never play the game enough to be high enough level to use them.
---
I agree that this is definitely a change of pace for them. But at the same time this was a problem of their own making, and I have to disagree that they’re trying their best. They put the development of this game on Bethesda Austin’s shoulders, and it’s clear that they were not ready for this kind of a workload. 
---
The repair option is in a lot of games an yes I've tried it an no it doesn't work.
---
One look at the PA HUD for 21:9 proves that.
---
Dont have the will to complete dmv ugghhh
---
No, you are not entitled to anything. If you are in America, you have the right of freedom of speech. That freedom does not give you carte blanche to say whatever you want, whenever you want. You are not entitled to a fair trial, you have the right to be tried in a courtroom and judged by a jury of your peers. The only thing you are entitled to do is breathe, urinate, defecate, and if you make enough money pay taxes. The way certain government programs have been named is a problem in and of itself. You do not have the right to any kind of special treatment, no matter what your mommy told you.

It's the same deal with the bobby pin issue. It's not the specific issue that is the problem but the underlying trend it represents.
---
In both the bobby pin case and this one too it's about a lack of quality control.
---
Dang,I guess the jet pack is worth it at least on one set! Too bad it’s on my X-01
---
Neat.
---
I guess you were a more advanced subject than myself.
---
My Xbox has like 8TB storage so I never uninstall because I haven't ran out of space yet, but I will if it tracks it tbh.
---
It was my original complaint, that there is nothing here to really keep people playing.  I got bored at level 15.  I can't imagine grinding to 100.
---
I guess with friends, sure, but even then all I do is raid some shitty village or something, drag everything that isn't nailed down to a workbench to break down, and repair my gear and see if I have anything I can upgrade, then deal with storage being full, and end up just throwing so much shit away.  All while staving off hunger/thirst.
---
It feels like a boring &amp; tedious job.
---
Even free to play &amp; making perk cards something to pay for, still wouldn't save the ultimate problem is that a world devoid of NPC's is boring as hell.
---
I don't care about any of the terminal quests, or any random notes, I've already figured it out on my own.
---
Everyone's dead, Dave.  Yes, everyone. Everyone is dead.  YES, DAVE EVERYONE'S DEAD, EVERYONE'S DEAD DAVE, EVERYONE'S DEAD!

---
You’re right, holy crap it’s a dumpster fire lol
---
&gt; Vendor plans now cost more Caps. Vendor prices were originally based on rarity. Guaranteeing their appearance in a Vendor’s inventory significantly increased the availability of most plans and recipes, and we’ve increased their cap prices as a result. Cap prices have been set relatively high to allow for a market to still exist where players can steal your shit.
---
Fixed it
---
that's why i said "some" of course it depends on what you have downloaded and its size. i currently have 40 games and 60% of my external still free. 
---
Oh
---
how much would a T-51B left arm cost?
---
I just don't buy that excuse. If its a good game peoppe always come back even when they say they wont.
---
This game has a metric ton of problems and still thousands of players with 100+ hours proving even if they dont think its great there is something about it that keeps calling them back. Its what makes these annpying posts crying for more and more and more no matter what they do.
---
If you read the patches they have fixed over 100 issues in 78 days. Thats pretty damn impressive. 
---
The content will come.
---
The players will come back.
---
The shitstorm posts will come with them.
---
The people who like it anyone will stay in r/fo76filthycasuals.
---
I think I've spent more time reloading the game from disconnects than actually playing lol 
---
Same it's a glitch any beta players don't have it I believe
---
I uninstalled FO76 and the launcher after a buddy of mine told me he saw me "online" in FO76 a couple times when I hadn't even booted up the launcher or game.  
---
The problem isn't just that this is their first attempt at doing online fallout. It's that they're doing online exclusively for the profits.
---
Nothing wrong with wanting to make money, but what we are seeing is companies putting profit so  far above everything else that the product is suffering.  We have been on a downward slope for some time now, and it isn't going to get better.
---
All we can hope for is the few good companies that are left to keep putting out quality products, and hope they don't get bought by EA.
---
Fuck Bethesda, they jumped the shark years ago.  They're going to milk their shitty shit game engine for another decade.  Fuck them.
---
That's weird considering the Browns are one of the worst franchises in sports and had a recent stretch of time where they won 1 out of 32 games.
---
Shit, youngster...I'm 57. Fallout is my jam, although I did start my gaming life on text-based games and MUDs.
---
I so desperately wanted this game to be good since my dad's side of my family is from West Virginia, but as soon as I read it was multiplayer only, I gave up. Bethesda games are buggy, very fucking buggy. They depend on the modders to fix their games, and since it's multiplayer, nobody can fix that. This game is a mess, and it needs to be cleaned up. They need to put all their effort into FIXING this game. Fuck, rewrite it if they have to.
---
Make sure all of your junk is in your stash. That glitch happened to me but putting my junk in my stash fixed it
---
Yes, that should be the basis of difficulty for high lvl enemies not a shit ton of hit points. 
---
From what I have seen them do for the last few months no, it's not a leap at all. You can think they are incompetent, which they seem to be, but you can' tell me they are sloppy in one area and not at all in another.
---
No, I just didn't skip over the second holotape hidden in the Overseers office from Todd.
---
It is an early post misinterpreting the understandably strange weapon.  It seemed like a unique BPR, But is in fact a weapon in its own right.  I have a nocturnal dragon, which is witchy :)
---
True. We got a lot of young talent. Devin Booker, DA, TJ Warren, etc
---
Nobody cares if you care or not. Don’t be a piece of shit. 
---
So much yes, what about strength and all the carry weight perks.  A lot of those appear to be fairly mandatory.  Are we going to lower their effectiveness while boosting everything's weight slightly?
---
The lone wanderer is dead!! All the old gods died with him! YES MAN RULES FOR ETERNITY

One of the dialog options in New Vegas lets your character ask an NPC what a fish is, so I'd imagine they aren't common. 
---
I mean in an ideal sense, definitely agree. What i've seen is plenty of people (recently) just upvoting the meanest or most outrageous thing to aggressively send anger. I get where it's coming from but we need to harness it into a either healthier or more productive way than most are right now.   
---
Comprehensive addressing vs. Selective; I'll take either but neither seems to be the way this is flowing at the moment.
---
At least you always beat the Steelers.
---
People don't stand outside restaurants. They go online and leave a negative review, similar to what people are doing here. 
---
Damn!! Looks great!
---
2f in Columbus here, colder in hilliard. 
---
It's two different mods. You just put them both on. I've got lots of photos and video of it. It's fantastic. Also terrifying!
---
Wait.... You searched the Overseer's office? They are going to send you out into the wastes.
---
Maybe an extractor like the Brahmin pen but near water
---
Maybe my set of Browns fans I've met is very small and my in-laws just don't want me making fun of their team.
---
Or it could be some other reason.
---
Nah, casuals typically have 1 TSE gun. You typically build that collection as you go on, or move on to an Instigating, Furious, Anti Armor, or simply a better weapon with TSE on it. Giveaways to low leveled players are quite common. Every friend that I played with got a crack at my level 5 TSE Pump Action, until they were properly leveled, and had the capital to trade for another, higher leveled TSE. Most of them are full time students or have full time jobs. I consider a casual a person who plays 2-4 hours a night, which is a healthy amount of play. You can certainly exceed level 50 in about a month of gameplay, and get your own TSE by setting up a LFG or joining a connected discord earlier than that. I always point noobs in the direction of the Bazaar and the Trading subreddits. 
---
Some players I’ve encountered like to go it alone and avoid most player interaction, and there’s methods for them as well. If I can talk to these people, or put them in teams, I usually point them in the direction of horde events (where I got my level 5 TSE Pump shotty) in the forest, which spawn a for sure 3 star item, and that’s an easy way to grab a low level explosive gun, for those looking to get good gear over exploration in the early game, but do keep in mind that RNG is simply RNG, and a guy who’s logged about 2 hours in the game could have some OP ass level 20 shotgun he just can’t use cause he isn’t a high enough level.
---
Had this with a weapon. Just make sure you unbulk the materials that are bulked that don't have any loose parts.

Positive experience &gt; Negative experience.

On Xbox I was level 50 before being out of beta and so we're many others. None of us are counted as even leaving the vault, etc.

chicom.  have not heard that word in a long time.

"when up on the ridge line, there arose such a clatter,

a chicom machine gun had started to chatter.

up nelson, up hicks, up johnston and jones!
---
get outta that rack and rustle your bones.
---
get up on that ridge and don't you come back,
---
till you knock off that slope, and bring his gun back!"
---
lol
---
Something something gold
---
Are you happy now?
---
Mmm nah. I like being able to know when the game has become less stagnant
---
If you use the Super Duper perk, the word Super will negate the fact that you're a Duper and you won't have to worry about it. 😆
---
This is Reddit. Maybe I just read into it as if it were an attack because that's what I expect. Been called a duper, but I don't even know how, been called a cry baby for complaining that it would be easier to start over than Respec my character. I own every fallout. I have always loved the franchise. I bought this one after hearing all the bad stuff, and I loved it too. But now that my character can't solo stuff that's just near my level it really pisses me off. Watching someone on YouTube talk about the Nerf then show their shotgun went from 1200 dmg to 550 dmg also pass me off. Because I never had that high to begin with. I just don't understand why they wouldn't just make it so that two shot explosive no longer drop. Not nerf both two shot and explosive. My backup gun was a two shot 44 revolver that was about 200 damage now it's 110. I have no perks for it like I do the shotgun. If I can no longer solo a 50 SB then how can I solo like they said? I don't like grouping. I prefer solo.
---
Do you have rad worms, It has been causing all kinds of screwy effects, notably multiplying mutations, on my character the 50% more 50% more hunger and thirst while moving with speed demon caused visible depletion of my water and food, even better was the 50% more parasite food drain keeping me in a semi perminant starved state. Fun times.

Why are you posting this shit if you don't even know simple facts any nfl fan would know? You're not witty or interesting or really anything. I don't even watch football lately. Your comments are disingenuous. Trolling is stupid as fuck and people are realizing it. Go find something useful to do.
---
This is correct. You can delete a game, reinstall it and still have your saved game files on PS4.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals

The Casuals sub has less dramatic reactions to things. It's probably better to hang out there until the new patch rolls out. 
---
Yeah, this entirely.  Espeically if you have any automatic rifles, nothing like shooting something down to 5% then it magically going back to 100% a few times.
---
Now I'm out of lead, and using a machete, which apparently I should have been using all along as it lasts longer, and deals far more damage.  Armor is fucking useless, I wonder if it's just holding me back I should just put it in a paper bag along with all my ammo and guns and just run around naked with a knife.
---
Not being able to scrap ammo hurts, but the world is so empty, so boring, everyone and everything is dead.  And like groundhog day it'll reset to the same day over and over so I can basically do the same thing over and over.

I don't mind the price of Gold. When my year of gold is up, I go to the store and pay 59.99 for a 12 month gold card. I figure I get enough in free games each month that $60 a year is worth it, even if I only play two or three of those games. I keep them, especially the 360 games for when younger children come to my house. My nieces and nephews love it. I just don't let them on my xbox one. 
---
Yes and thats how YOU felt, everyone doesnt think like you
---
Defending a company does not help the industry
---
Defending a company as a consumer is the most idiotic thing you can do 
---
&gt;  it's impossible to hide from a scourge beast us making the entire build completely useless 
---
um.. what? thats all I do, I dont even dare try to take them on, I sneak on by. Infact Ive spent entire times in towns with a scorchbeast overhead without him even noticing. So yeah something wrong with your build there.
---
These threads are important. Bethesda needs to see that this is not okay even if some of you seem to be happy with a subpar product that does not mean we all are.  
---
This has been happening for a while 
---
Which has been the case all along. There have been plenty of other more impactful issues. I could see quitting when enemies were invincible or when disconnects were worse, but bobby pin weight and auto-scrapping bulk? You run a fine line, my friend.
---
Straight ticket R voter?
---
But then they could choose to ignore them, delete all of them in a fit of rage!  Just like they do in real life!
---
do ya feel me?  BRING BACK THE MADDEN DAYS!!
---
funny you mention steelers.  i now live an hour north of pittsburgh.  when the raiders come to town, i make a day of it and go bash steeler fans! lmfao
---
If you're suggesting that PC players need to check out nightly-build graphics drivers, operating system compatibility modes and port forwarding/network optimisation to get this game to run then that isn't a 'lol PC players dumb' statement, it's a 'holy shit why are these requirements not listed' statement.
---
No, but you can play the xbox version on your pc through their streaming setup. I don't remember the name. 
---
Well, the air does get turned off, so not like I could hang out in the vault.  Todd is a little bitchboy like that.
---
Like kingdom hearts 3?
---
I'm going to be clear here.
---
You have literally said it's not about your fun it's everyone's fun.
---
So this is why I said you can stop replying anytime.  Everyone's fun isn't my responsibility to care about.  It's my money, my time, and my way to play the game how I wish.
---
People like you who feel like it's your job to tell me what I should care about is the problem today.  I don't care what you do.  You keep replying like I should.  For everyone.
---
Do you listen to yourself?  Do you proof read?
---
Come on man.  I never once said you were wrong.  I never once said anyone was wrong.  I said wrong platform but that's a maybe.  
---
Do you shop at men's wearhouse and like the way you look?
---
Do you shop at walmart and like the way you look?  Do you see how arbitrary a catchy phrase is for a business?  This argument has just lost it's value.  
---
The lastly what's REALLY weird is that you say I don't care if people play fallout 76.  Yet here you are literally caring about me and my enjoyment with a game.
---
Then you focus on a I don't know answer how a better platform can be used.  Which is weird because I don't care about the gripes you and others share.  I provides constructive ideas.  However it's not my job to tell you how to find those things.
---
Put it this way a consultant at a company is going to tell you have they think you can save x amount t of money by doing Y.  They don't have to give you Z.  Because the consultant is there to provide solution to save money.  Now to execute that plan another consultant will provided that plan and employ a project manager.  
---
So by asking me what's a better platform when I don't have the expertise in rallying a large group of people when I don't have the practice or experience behind it just makes another weak argument to hate on me.
---
I seriously think you need to take a hard look at what you're saying.  It's ridiculous and personal attacks.  
---
I'm the type of person who makes these games and discussion like this absolutely shit?  You made it shit.  By chosing me to continuing to argue.  It's embarrassing that your logic is this broken.  
---
Nope. No diseases or mutations.
---
Go suck a bag of of dicks you clown. 
---
Can't compare FO76 to FO4, they're not even near the same game. Sure, they share an engine, but one is a multiplayer game and one is a single player rpgs with very different scripts, balancing, you name it, it's different in 76. \*full stop\* it seems like you're upset that people wanna make this game their main hobby. I side with you on the part where you are happy it caters to the casual moreso in this new patch. It made weapon diversity a thing, I can actually pvp without using explosive weapons now. But I have news for you, the new TSE is called Bloodied/Explosive with a full set of unyielding/sentinel gear. You're still gonna get one shot by someone you can't see or maybe can't put the full amount of dmg into. It's not on the exact same level as TSE, but you're still gonna have your 300+ hour people like me who this is what we do. We play the shit out of videogames, because it's what we love to do. I did it in WoW as well and it was a great time. I'll talk to other people, look up youtube stuff, test things in game, etc to find out what is the best possible method to go about the game. I don't see the outrage of the small percentage of us you seem to see complaining. While you are typing out wordy reddit posts about a small percentage of people who obsess over this game, we (well besides me) are out there trying to find the next best thing. I heard TSE was getting nerfed 3 weeks ago, that is ample time to start preparing and theorizing what will be the next big come up. Your logic doesn't even make sense if you think about it, the 5% of people no-lifing it are the ones complaining? No, it's not. It's the people who get frustrated after a few things didn't go there way, be it PvP or the goddamn SBQ not dropping loot for the 50th time. \*you don't have to and were never obligated to keep playing\*
---
It’s incredibly easy. I love finding peoples camps and looking at them, for ideas. Or just out of curiosity. What I do is look at my map and find someone who isn’t moving and away from any icon (whatever it’s called. Places like vendors, camp venture, white springs etc). Plus I noticed people tend to build in the same spots.
---
There's dozens of us!
---
This is actually a near requirement if we are supposed to have a player "market" for selling goods from expensive plans that have been purchased. 
---
Without server wide text chat the best we would be able to do is continually fast travel to people asking in voice chat if they are interested in buying anything. That would cost a ton of caps and make the whole idea moot. Yeah you could try to party invite for the free fast travel but most people don't accept random invites

If you pay money for a product and are not happy with it which he is in total rights of not being, its a subpar product priced at a premium price. Some of us want value for our money or at least a working product.  
---
Take your average is good enough attitude elsewhere friend.  
---
&gt;What i've seen is plenty of people (recently) just upvoting the meanest or most outrageous thing to aggressively send anger. I get where it's coming from but we need to harness it into a either healthier or more productive way than most are right now. 
---
Then it's incumbent  on cooler heads to find and upvote the constructive messages (not just the positive ones) and downvote the unhelpful and overly negative ones.
---
At the end of the day up and down votes aren't an indicator of quality but of popularity. If anger and negativity are popular, especially now,  I personally don't blame them.
---
I never really cared about weekly challenges, do they not work?
---
This post is spot on. But we all must agree to the fact that energy weapons are beyond useless. Next update will be telling on which way this game will swing

I got bored @15.  I might logon for 20-30 minutes.  Long enough to feel isolated and bored.

I think I'm going to try to find some more Med-X or something and see if I can overdose.
---
FYI, the best reason to play New Vegas on a computer is so you can enjoy all the mods that make it look less dated.
---
Agreed, in all aspects. 
---
While I was looking forward to that 1200 damage tse shotgun. I was also ok with the nerf, due to it being far to strong. 
---
Found my first 2 shot just last night. Ofcourse it had to be a flamer.... lol 
---
And my first explosive projectile today in a decent 3 star gattling.
---
While it's been a disappointment in execution, I've truly enjoyed 76. I will continue playing and go for a ride until I'm bored with it. Which could be years down the road.
---
Keep up the hard work Bethesda.. Thank you

all armor pieces are 100 caps, ur resources

I have 500 in my inventory.

ditto.  i hide in buildings, and eventually it goes away.

It's an every patch thing, don't worry too much.

Well jc I learn something nee everyday.
---
RDR2 is about 100gb, and a lot of games are close to that if you don't have the physical version. Last ten games like GTA push 60 and God Forbid that you record hd clips for social media, you'll eat 50 ti 100 on recent clips alone. 
---
I’m sorry that you’re frustrated, FloppyGrandmaTitties.
---
Lol 😂 not the way to achieve if I had it I would give it only if I was able to take it away from your ass lol 
---
23 and rain over here in pittsburgh pa
---
Thanks bruh
---
Your poor reasoning and non-arguments are much less entertaining, believe me.
---
What I said
---
&gt; designed the original copy to degrade 
---
is very different than
---
&gt; systems break over time 
---
One is called "normal wear and tear" the other is the deliberate degradation of a product to force you to purchase a new one for continued use.
---
Next part, nostalgia is not a recognized mental illness or addiction.  It is not unhealthy.  They are not preying on your nostalgia in the same way that a restaurant doesn't prey on your hunger.  They are providing a product for a completely healthy behavior.  Lootboxes prey on customers with a propensity for gambling *addiction.*  That's the important word.  If you buy and play a remaster instead of the new game that came out some day you aren't being preyed on.  You are choosing to play a game.  It isn't ruining your life, save having a video game addiction (in which case marketing *any* game, not just remasters, to the addict in question would be a poor practice).  Remasters are not an inherently bad business practice.
---
I cry BS on "casuals use TSE." Maybe a casual that bought one from a duper, but a casual who got one naturally? Vidz or it didn't happen.
---
I have a few hundred hours in the game. I've played since beta. I have NEVER gotten a TSE. Not once. Same for my wife, who has about the same play time. I've gotten several TS guns, and I once got a level 15 explosive gatling, and that's it. Ninety percent of my legendary weapon drops the ironic variety, like a machine gun that does double damage to undamaged enemies (wow, so that first bullet does 80 dmg to the zillion hp monster) or a rolling pin that does extra damage to mirelurks. Real useful stuff. I've gotten that exact effing rolling pin three times. 
---
Obviously, I've got significant bias here, my entire legendary arsenal (all TS) has been reduced to junk. That said, I don't think TS should have been nerfed, it should've been the explosive. Just nerf the one, leave the other one be. 
---
The gift that keeps on giving.
---
This whole ordeal with **all** the fuck ups is unprecedented. You can't make something like this up, it's just too unbelievable.
---
Amazing (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
That's really good to know, and explains the strange numbers for those and other qchievements.
---
That means:
---
The number for those that reached 25 is more like 60%.
---
~38-40% of players are beta players, ~60-62% are not (some margin of error for people who purchased and haven't played yet, I'm sure there are a number).
---
Sorry r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Yeah pretty much... The recent patch drove a lot of diehards away. sad. 🙁
---
Well fucking said.
---
I’m not mad thats fucking funny
---
Where do you get oil lamps
---
If you didn't buy it. Then GTFO. Nobody gives a shit what you say, think, or that you even continue to breathe. 
---
because gatekeeping has worked so well for Dr Who, Star Trek, Star Wars, Comics.... (rolls eyes)
---
What’s worse is they could’ve bought a better game like Red Dead 2
---
Are you referring to the last patch?
---
Grab a 2h weapon, slowly pick up perks to go full melee. You're in PA so at the very least you have 11 str, pick up 1 rank of each slugger and work on incisor as you can. While your guns are nerfed and no longer 1 hit kills it should still be useable for gaining the levels to switch, just will take a little longer than usual lol
---
Young lady, I am an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it, and say "bzz bzz bzz"
---
I'm just about done with game. Uninstalled
---
seems there are a bunch of challenges that do not work.  like on one character, i have discovered all the locations, yet no atoms for it.  challenge says i have only discovered 7 areas?  really?
---
&gt; entitled
---
You mean paying customers.
---
I believe the mods are still loot. And fuck if I get another explosive vents mod I could build a base out of them. But the main pieces (arms legs helmet) should be available to craft freely after completing the required quest to gain them. Not be locked to an enemy. And I don’t know if you made the comment about Bethesda assuming everyone plays a certain way, but I believe it should be a safe assumption that the main plot line is followed. I did not follow it, I wanted x-01 sooner. 
---
I hear ya. I have played all but Fallout Brotherhood (which doesn't count really) and was also hoping for this to be better, but they just nerf everything. I took two weeks off during Christmas and have 300 hours in. I've never gotten a two shot explosive, but did manage to get a two shot plasma rifle. Unfortunately, since they still haven't addressed energy weapons at all, its damage has always been weak and it breaks super fast. But then they go and nerf two shot. So it went from 66 ballistic and energy to 33. I do more damage to scorchbeasts with my tesla rifle. I might as well toss the plasma rifle now. What they should have done all along was make it so the explosive legendary effect was not affected by perks and just gives a flat damage increase to the weapon like it did in Fallout 4. I mean, you can make separate effects for things in the Creation Kit and they can actually adjust the code of the game in a way that the Creation Kit can't. But instead we get what we always have from the beginning... nerf. I'm ready to start shouting "Fus Ro Dah" at the screen and see if I can kill the Scorchbeasts faster, since they are just bat dragons after all.
---
But don’t be afraid, just try to slow things down a bit take your time, there’s a lot to find out and learn
---
What is the acid good for?
---
Really? What exactly did they fix? Lol

No, he just said the air gets turned off. He's in there partying with codsworth.
---
This guy ketos....still downvoted you though for the stick in your ass 
---
Ok.  That was clever.
---
huh?  interesting.
---
God you just really don't wanna admit what a failure this game was do you
---
It’s great fun finding a friendly scorchbeast and leading a mirelurk queen to it to slaughter
---
I can't possibly second this enough I've done all those things I've done all those things a lot and not band it's not a thing it's an excuse.
---
How many times do people have to see SOB stories in Steam forums for example and then developer comes in and tells the true story and even though that person was really convincing they were full of s***.
---
I have no doubt that they were for false positives on the 1st ban run but if they were really that dumb and building their algorithm there would be a lot more people banned and complaining then there are.
---
While it's a display, it's fruitless.  You already paid for the product.  From a business standpoint, they already have their revenue.  As well, disinterest only shows that they should invest less in development support for the already released product.  One thing it will help them decide is to do less in the online market space.  It will have the exact opposite effect you want.  
---
This worries me.
---
Ahhh dang haha no worries. Really need the marine legs and torso badly lol. Tryin to switch my character over to Melee/firearms instead of just the latter. No one told le how good they are vs ballistic firearms in 76 till i found out on my own lol
---
OMG MUDs!!! Used to play them with my buddies in the campus computer lab late at night lol! 
---
Look left
---
.... 
---
Look North

you see a road that travels North and South...

Move north

......

Walk North

You Walk North along the road...

OMG just brought me back!

I think that there is a guaranteed spawn at the newspaper office in Charleston.

That’s only true on weapons that don’t have other receiver options (50cal being one)

On PC, it's the following:

CHALLENGES &gt; CHARACTER &gt; Explore Appalachia for 7600 Hours (20 atoms)
---
Hey, that works out to $0.01 worth of atoms for every 380 hours played!
---
I am up to 349 hours.
---
What a waste of time
---
Hotfix by definition is  a small piece of code developed to correct a major software bug or fault and released as quickly as possible. 
---
So good job making your definition up.
---
And anyone can join reddit, there is no exclusivity or hierarchy.  If that is not representative, then certainly nothing else is.  And if nothing is representative, then what do you have for Bethesda to look at?  Reddit and their own forums, which is exactly what they do.
---
Agree, game polling would be superior.  If it existed. 
---
So this is the worst source of feedback, except for all the other ones.... 
---
You have been eaten by a grue!

DON’T FUCKING DO IT, REDDIT.
---
DON’T GO THERE

Oh lol, it was small bobble heads when it could stack. Sorry bout that mistake.
---
Uniform voucher is for the outfit not for the under armor. The under armor spawns in one of the half circle buildings commonly known as barracks. There will be an APC sitting there.
---
The main building can spawn one as well as well as the containers might spawn one. The tower may also spawn one. Ammo bags are there as well. I think i found 2 or 3 the first time i went there. Check all vehicles, containers or anywhere loot can spawn. Im sure you can upgrade the fatigues but i have not been able to yet. 
---
I have seen them at Grafton but not sure if they are static spawns
---
^this 
---
The way armor works 125 ER cuts the damage of a single 125 damage hit in half, if you are dealing less damage per hit reistance is more effective, against 25 damage hits it's cutting your damage by around 75%, meaning you need to deal about 10 shots, 250 damage to deal 62.5
---
also, armor piercing doesn't effect energy weapons.
---
And most enemies have more energy resist than armor, super mutants get up to around 178 armor and 300 energy resist.
---
Once again, it's neither of those things. It's the ongoing trend of a lack of quality control. If the trend was that things were improving, this would be a non-issue. It's the opposite. THAT is the issue, not the specifics regarding bobby pins or junk.
---
I don't mind not 1 shotting lvl 62 ferals, but when it takes me 3 shots for a lvl 5 and I am mostly specced for sniper that is a little crazy. 
---
It's true though.
---
I've literally never had a friend buy me anything in my life. Where can I get friends like you? People are selfish at heart.
---
Maybe they could give us the option of naming them would help. 
---
Not just the official forums, they did it on here too the night the patch was released and there was an explosion of backlash. A mod made a post about it claiming it was due to them being "low-effort complaint threads", after being called out for deleting numerous lengthy well thought out posts, and having every comment, including their snarky remarks downvoted to -100 plus and the post having a 1% upvote rating, he quietly deleted the post in the middle of the night and continued along.
---
Would be cool if it were more fun, but it isn’t.  Having no budget for turrets, and turrets not firing on enemies even right in front of them, make defending (and inevitably repairing) CAMP pretty tedious
---
Return of an old bug.  Sigh.
---
Hence "mostly" resolved
---
No those are his wings he torn them off as intimidation 
---
Any nuked flora goes bad relatively quickly and weighs a ton as inert flux. 
---
I hope not. I finished the Belly Of The Beast quest. Got the ultracitr Armor. Decided I didn’t really need the raider Armor so decided to sell the parts to a vendor. Of course you can’t figure out which Armor is which unless you take it out. But the raider Armor wouldn’t materialize. Kept trying over and over and it just wouldn’t. After 15 minutes trying to make it materialize, it came out identical to the x01. Right down to the paint job. Tried to reset and jump servers and it stayed that way. Now I’m afraid to scrap it in case it fixes itself and I scrap the wrong one. 
---
Keep dreaming.
---
Preach it's sad that you had to actually explain it to them. 
---
Yes, but I experienced this several times last night, on Xbox, before the Hotfix.
---
I have a 3 star legendary Pipe Rifle that does 30% damage to Mirelurks, Explosive and +1 Perception. 
---
I also have a 2 star Legendary Pipe Rifle that does 30% damage to Scortched and has a 10% damage increase when looking down the scope.
---
It's a circlejerk at this point and everyone knows it, even OP. If you're not repeating their tired rhetoric expect to be shunned. 
---
Me yelling... Where the heck did that come from?!?!?!

Yup, poseidon fusion core processor is not starting up after poseidon PP is fixed and restarted, missions not playing out as supposed to, i left right after that shit im on a new game until they get their shit together otherwise ill leave for good if i keep putting up with it.
---
It didn't work last week and now it's up again as the challenge for this week. It's worth the most points. People that want atom shop items and don't spend real money on atoms care very much. 
---
Ikr sure makes me glad I wasted $60 on a game thats still getting BUG FIXES months after release. Loving the continued support with 0 content being added 
---
Perk cards matter tho like the other day I crafted 80 mininukes but no big deal with ordnance express without it I was like 400 lbs overweight lol
---
I say this all the time. Thumbs up to you!
---
Here we go Brownies here we go WOOF WOOF
---
Wait until youve spent a ton of time and resources and ammo on taking a new sweet workshop, then get disconnected from a server so someone else can spend a few caps for a fully operational workshop.
---
I guess we need to report it to Bethesda cause that's a bit important.
---
I just use rad away a lot so I can’t tell you
---
Thanks I'll check that out.
---
I kind of felt this was going to be a shit show but picked it up on the first price drop.
---
It's crazy just how much this game missed the mark.
---
There is a couple of stores here that have the $200 helmet thing on display, and it's such shoddy work I'd be embarrassed to have bought it.  Not that I have space for such useless tat anyways.
---
Maybe it’s a new and improved feature. 🙄
---
I'm there Jan 10 patch notes, one of the changes was to lower repair costs for mid and high level armor, by as much as 20%. In today's In the Vault blog post they also talk about lowering these costs further in a future patch.
---
I've put probably about 30 hours into it. Maybe closer to 40. And I've only had the server disconnect maybe five times in the whole time.
---
Me and the two friends I play with are actually having a a really good time. We love building up our bases and being neighbors and whatnot. Then once we're done building, go out and be wastelanders.
---
Me and a buddy played uninterrupted yesterday for about six to seven hours. And we had a blast.

PRAISE GERALDO!
---
If you have more than one character, the vendor correctly identifies if you know a plan. Before it didn't differentiate between characters.
---
Not the vendor's there right? Grafton vendors are the only ones I've checked after the patch so they definitely don't sell them.
---
I've never had "stop errors" in windows 10 before today's hotfix.
---
Huzzah?
---
Even EA gives you the option to move games. Bethesda not so much. Like really, how hard can it be program in a "Move my install" button to link and copy the game to another folder. 
---
Which Lickers?  Because aside from 1 in the area by the safe deposit room, every licker ha either been a scripted unavoidable event or in a hallway so small that there is no space to walk by them, and so much as nudging them sets them off.  I can use flashbangs, but I need to save them for Mr. X and getting the zombies off me.  But that isn't sneaking so much as making them look the other way and hope they don't catch me as I run.  At least Lickers don't follow you through rooms.  
---
the view of a kitty cat lol. to be serious, that is a horrible bug.
---
40 points. The biggest atom challenge. Looks like it's broken for everyone on all platforms for two consecutive weeks. 
---
What game doesn’t have bug fixes? Yeah it’s a great idea to add all the content three months into release!! Wow Reddit knows everything. Fucking ape
---
Apparently there is
---
&gt;The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don’t fire bullets, so we’ve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod
---
Literally right there; removal for realism. If it was for balance, they would have just cut it for the highest damage weapons, rather than including the flamer or plasma pistol.
---
I'll be waiting for the next patch to come out as well.
---
In the meantime I'm going to jump back into my childhood and play some kingdom hearts 3.
---
Bobby berfed in the bin again?
---
I actually had that happen to me once. I hadn't spent too much time, nor that many resources. Still, I know the frustration
---
I love this sooo much!
---
Oh yes, paid reviewers and twitch whores are the epitomy of objectivity LMAO . BTW in case you haven't noticed journalism isn't exactly about honesty these days. Doubt its hard to buy off a YouTuber either.
---
I feel ya. I tried to solo "Belly of the Beast" which I should be able to do with enough strategy and stim packs. I didn't even make it to the SB. A level 40 mirelurk King got me with one hit. We need some slightly OP weapons for end game because the SB just spam their Sonic attack over and over and no armor in the game is an effective defense. Taking cover in buildings doesn't work it just comes through the walls and roof. I would be okay if they did what you suggest and lowered it to where it is during pvp. But it will take me roughly 40 levels to respect all of my shotgun perks. That's going to take a long time.
---
They didn’t make much money on it. Fallout 76 did worse in sales than Battlefield 5 and that game did really bad. Neither of those games even broke the Top 10 selling games of 2018 list that was released last week. 
---
They’re not gonna fix the game or do DLC simply because the game did dogshit in sales. It’s really that simple and the report proves that. Why would they give much support to a game that barely brought them enough money as they hoped?
---
Bulked junk is auto-scrapping again :(
---
I bought a Xbox One for the division.
---
I think I played it for 2 hours.
---
Oh well, it makes a great YouTube machine.
---
Yes?
---
what so we are getting what they envisioned all along i  dont think so.
---
So what we are all meant to love Melee Weapons that do thousands upon thousands of damage and people complained oh 2se are too powerful they do like 1000 damage lol.
---
compared to melee 2se was like using a commie whacker..
---
I would love the multiplayer aspect if it was well done.
---
It is not.
---
This is how language develops, when word meanings are changed.  Get over it

Don’t ever take from Ark lol. Is a garbage buggy game that just continues to get buggier.
---
Good luck finding somewhere to hide in a nuke zone 
---
&gt; Secondly nobody is saying TSE didn’t some what a nerf.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I’m also 53 years old mature adult. That worked in the Game Industry as a Developer. Downvote all you want. I’m 53 retired and Invisible Internet points don’t stop me from speaking my opinion.
---
Dude, I down voted you because you are incoherent and your arguments don't hold water.  
---
Claiming the people here are an immeasurably small portion of the playerbase while admittedly having no idea how large the player base is would be the funniest part of this thread if it wasn't overshadowed by the sheer irony that while you insist the upset players are the definite minority, there's a post saying "Stop Defending Bethesda" that has literally 5 times the upvotes this one does.
---
Safe to say the complacent "suck it up" crowd is the minority at this point, sorry.
---
I should mention, I love this game. I love the franchise and most all of Bethesda games. I am just curious about the behavior of employees with the behind the scenes stuff. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Bethesda should take notes from Bungie. The way they handle communication in Destiny 2 nowadays is fantastic. 
---
hasnt changed still misses 94% of 95% vats shots...
---
Jesus Christ this game lmao this happened to me also but reloading fixed it for me
---
&gt;What exactly are the improvements? 
---
I guess you be never played the game? The game has vastly improved since the launch
---
Would be nice wouldn't it? But they are ignoring the patches that modders are sending them. 
---
This only happens to me if I pull out the Pip-Boy before everything is finished loading. So what you want to do is just try to pull out a weapon or switch weapons or reload weapon until that works don't open your Pip-Boy.
---
It's a work around till they fix it but haven't had that problem since I started following that process.
---
is that implying it wont be in the vendor afterwards?
---
"In the meantime, you can still purchase the loose mod for this headlamp from the Enclave Vendor."
---
U got slightly a few hours played more than me..but tbh I kind of lost the desire to play :(
---
On PC? I wanna visit.
---
Berf? Who had a kid?
---
I'm really chuffed man, thanks for the Silver, all the best :)
---
You’re calling this community “whiny” but in your statistics I think you overlooked a pretty crucial detail.  You yourself stated that on PS4, less than 5% of players have reached lvl 50.  F76 has around 1.3 million total sales on PS4, and the number of actual players is less when you factor in the people who have uninstalled/stopped playing the game.  5% of 1.3 mil is 65,000 players. This sub has over 170k people. So if this sub is not an accurate representation of the playerbase, those PS4 players are an even less accurate representation.

This patch had some berfs but had some nuffs too.
---
I agree with the legendaries, but bobby pins should stay as they are. They are cheap and easy to find, but they break quickly. If they contribute to your weight, you have to continuously micromanage keeping enough to last you a bit but not enough to weigh you down. Then you have to constantly be scrounging for more. For something that affects such a minor part of the game, it's not worth the stress and tedium. Maybe if they rework lockpicking to not require shuffling perks around, then we could talk about challenge related to bobby pins
---
I had my Nuka Cola T-51 duplicate itself over a set of Raider armor. It was all modded up, too! I sold it for 2500 caps, it was awhile ago and I'm fine.
---
It is funny as fuck, that it took a gun nerf for the fanboys to finally snap out of their bubble and realize how bad things are going lol
---
Ah right. I never needed to farm acid (though every time I say that about any freaking thing, I end up running out so I suspect I'll be scouting acid soon lol). 
---
everyone's dead. everyone's dead dave.  Dave, everyone's dead.  Dead. They are all dead.  They are all dead DAVE.
---
Ps4:(
---
What did I just read
---
Did they do anything with the damage output for the explosive weapons 
---
dude, you think the devs don't run the numbers?  A few whiners didn't get the weapons nerfed, basic fucking math did, and if not for duping, it would have taken a bit longer is all.
---
It was pointed out last week. 
---
Haha thanks bro. I did
---
im at almost 90hrs.
---
i do work unlike the players who play hundreds of hours as they just sit at home all day. :)
---
im loving the slow grind and farming for stuff. I have come from destiny so we know a thing or 2 about RNG haha :).
---
F u Man everyone makes mistakes this is a small one.
---
Fair enough 
---
The first Stalker with Autumn Aurora mod was my first Stalker experience. Loved that game.
---
&gt; I'm going to be clear here.  
---
&gt;You have literally said it's not about your fun it's everyone's fun.  
---
&gt;So this is why I said you can stop replying anytime. Everyone's fun isn't my responsibility to care about. It's my money, my time, and my way to play the game how I wish.  
---
&gt;People like you who feel like it's your job to tell me what I should care about is the problem today. I don't care what you do. You keep replying like I should. For everyone.
---
I literally don't care about your opinion or practically anyone's on this subreddit, unless their opinion is everyone should uninstall the game. As I said before, I'm just bored and you're replying.   
---
&gt;Come on man. I never once said you were wrong. I never once said anyone was wrong. I said wrong platform but that's a maybe. 
---
You started with, "maybe this isn't the best platform"... And even after I told you, what I've told you- You still reply like you have some reason to. 
---
 
---
&gt;Do you shop at men's wearhouse and like the way you look?  
---
&gt;Do you shop at walmart and like the way you look? Do you see how arbitrary a catchy phrase is for a business? This argument has just lost it's value.  
---
&gt;The lastly what's REALLY weird is that you say I don't care if people play fallout 76. Yet here you are literally caring about me and my enjoyment with a game.
---
I showed you that you're new and you don't understand what other people are doing about bitching about the game. Even though the people bitching are clearly the ones making waves and getting things fixed. I don't care if people play Fallout 76, I care about the state of the game and the money that I spent on it- Just like you do.   
---
The point being in all of this, the people who have been saying, "I'm still having fun!" Are the people that keep the game the laggy, buggy, server problem ridden mess that it is. If we all cried out in one voice and started upvoting the people pointing out problems with the game, more things would be done faster and Bethesda would \*have\* to be more transparent with it's fans. Since they've gone from: ***Beta&gt;Not Transparent&gt;Release&gt;Not Transparent&gt;Fan Complaints&gt;Not Transparent&gt;Baggegeddon&gt;Some Transparency&gt;Patches&gt;Some Transparency&gt;Patches&gt;Now***.   
---
Yet the people who have the most downvotes in this subreddit are most likely the people who complained about various problems- After *trying*  to bring light to certain topics and *after* reaching their breaking point with the game.   
---
Trust me, I'd rather be one of the mindless plebs at level 200 right now, rather than someone who's going to play catch up- If they ever fix this fucking game.   
---
Do you think people like me and other fans that have been criticising this game wanted it to turn out so badly? Do you think we want out $60-100+ of our money went to waste by a company being as shitty as Bethesda is now to it's fans? (I have a tendency to ramble and go on random rants)
---
&gt; Then you focus on a I don't know answer how a better platform can be used. Which is weird because I don't care about the gripes you and others share. I provides constructive ideas. However it's not my job to tell you how to find those things. 
---
Uhhh you mean when I clearly asked you, after your stupid post, "What better platform is there?" To which you responded, "Durrr I don't know, I'm just a mindless pleb."
---
&gt; Put it this way a consultant at a company is going to tell you have they think you can save x amount t of money by doing Y. They don't have to give you Z. Because the consultant is there to provide solution to save money. Now to execute that plan another consultant will provided that plan and employ a project manager. 
---
So are you saying that if I pay you, then we'll start a Fallout 76 boycott the likes of which have never been seen in the gaming industry?   
---
&gt; So by asking me what's a better platform when I don't have the expertise in rallying a large group of people when I don't have the practice or experience behind it just makes another weak argument to hate on me. 
---
.... Oh. So what you're saying, is you have no idea and don't have something better to offer than the mindless post you made, right?   
---
My Dad when I was young told me a saying to live by, maybe you've heard it- But it's doubtful, but he used to say: "It's better for people to *think* you're stupid, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt." 
---
You've clearly stated, this being like the 3rd time- That you have no idea what better platform to use and generally haven't brought something even generally constructive to the thread rather than, "Maybe you guys should just uninstall if you don't like it and boycott that way". Which was *only* your point, after your first point was proven to just be... Stupid... 
---
&gt; I seriously think you need to take a hard look at what you're saying. It's ridiculous and personal attacks. 
---
What have I been saying that I need to look at, that you deem, ridiculous? I get my personal attacks can probably bother someone, but that's the joy of not giving a single solitary fuck about your feelings. Just like with you and money, I don't have to worry about plebs feelings.  
---
&gt; I'm the type of person who makes these games and discussion like this absolutely shit? You made it shit. By chosing me to continuing to argue. It's embarrassing that your logic is this broken. 
---
Man, I really hope that you're a secret poster for Bethesda and you're actually one of their devs, because this would be so fucking satisfying. Can you tell me what games you've helped make or ones that you're working on, so I can boycott them? Since from your rhetoric, I don't ever want to support anything you're remotely a part of. 
---
Especially if you're this. fucking. stupid. 
---
I'm not a big or well known person, just a simple fan. And all I have to say to the community is that I'm heartbroken over how much a shit show this has become. I play duos with my real life best friend. For years we have played every fallout game side by side laughing, insulting and commenting on each others builds, playstyles and how we approached situations in a genre which there are so many choices to be made. All we ever wanted was to play together and when we finally get too it gets taken away.
---
Few days ago my best friend was banned after he shot another player with his OP af black powder rifle build. He hit over 10k dammage in a single shot. He was reported for cheating even though he wasn't. Hes now unable to access his Bethesda account at all.
---
Like I said, as a simple person all I wanted was to enjoy a fallout universe with my life long friend and now I cant. Please Bethesda developers fix your game, fix your content, fix your banning system, realize your mistakes. Learn from them and move on so that one day we can all hope to enjoy the product you've created that myself and many others have been waiting for so many years. Thanks you.
---
man people in the comments have not played any good games... wonder why they can still deal with fallout 76 for so long now.

God I love Australian lingo. Although I usually say Aussiestralian, but that goes back to when my neighbor's family had a foreign exchange student from Australia and I always had to pick on her.
---
Hoping now that they  made stashes Container's and only allow you to collect each stash every 24 hour they will bring back some of the WS stashe's
---
&gt;Yeah it’s a great idea to add all the content three months into release!! 
---
Yeah because wanting new content is the same as saying release EVERYTHING NOW. You cant even compare 76's bug fixes to any other game because fallout can hardly run with all the bugs it has. keep sucking off bethesda while other games start getting actual endgame content because they release in working condition. Geez you're so smart why can't everyone think like you?? There are no words to describe someone as dumb as you 
---
While the term has seen a lot of changes, it originally did mean fixing an issue while on. The definition changed because so many developers misused it.
---
Just look at any thing dealing with the word "hot"
---
Like hot swapping an xbox game to mod it. Hot swapping literally means "taking out a disc while its running"
---
Electricians use the term "hot" to signify that a power source is live.
---
A hot boot in computer terms refers to a reboot while the system is on, versus a cold boot when its off.
---
Just because the majority of people misuse a term doesnt make it correct, and just because the first google result that comes up means its correct either. Remember a person is the one writing those definitions. Not an all seeing always correct AI that some people seem to think the internet is.
---
I wonder this as well.  I could only imagine the gossip between departments. I doubt anyone’s been fired but there is definitely a “dead man walking” employee around. 
---
You see I have a fundamental desire to play properly so I am struggling with the decision of what to do with the armor
---
Lol, I’d save it’s alive and well, but it’s just kind of alive. Still servers for conquest large on Xbox at least. 
---
Vault Tech Bed 2 is the one with the OD green wool blanket on it. Simple Modern Bed is the one with a wood head/footboard, white sheets, pillows, and blue Vault Tech blanket on it.
---
This is why I unsubscribe
---
I'm just kidding. It's much better than my dump.
---
As I see this you have 666 upvotes. You are indeed the devil for recommending this game and the punishment you have wrought upon yourself will be to continue in this barren wasteland for all of eternity!
---
I love all the people making posts complaining about the complaint posts.  I'd say it is 50/50 at this point.
---
You deserve it, it's so rare for anyone on Reddit to listen to someone else's point of view and at the very least try to understand it, its the Reddit users like you that keep my faith in the platform amongst all the "my way or no way" users.
---
It would be interesting to see. I really can't imagine there being very many people working on the game, I would love to know exactly how things are being handled. Maybe someone will make a documentary some day :p
---
I’ve gotten some helmet mod on my main, yeah, pretty sure that’s the only other one though.
---
They can't even hotfix properly atm. 
---
Level 150 and I'm loving the update(despite the bugs obviously but they haven't personally hurt me, oh no 3 pounds of bobby pins) the pvp actually last more than one shot and it's forcing people off that high horse when they actually have to test skill against skill. 
---
Got rid of an explosive SMG as it was level 30 and no use to me anymore post-patch, the amount of excitement I saw in that level 35 when I showed up at his camp and asked if he wanted it is what keeps me playing. Hope he's getting the same use out of it as I did.
---
Unit testing is hard, la!
---
It's the same reason why there is a 'dev room' in the production servers.
---
Or how they can have massive regressions to an update as nobody even looks at the diffs/merges.
---
The failure to use source control, unit testing, and separate servers, maps for dev is insane!
---
I crashed fighting a wendigo when I was so close to killing it after 3 attempts. I am not clearing the cave from all the mirelirks again today
---
No I’m mad as hell because after this last patch I’m randomly overencumbered and can’t fast travel even when under my carry weight, the game constantly crashes, I have yet to successfully launch a nuke because every time I get close it crashes and I have to start all over, and each patch seems to make shit worse instead of better. Along with a laundry list of other more minor problems.
---
I wanted this game to be good, and as others have said if it was offered as a DLC for Fallout 4 with the understanding that it was incomplete then it’d be fine. But instead they marketed this bullshit as a complete stand alone game and it’s broken as fuck. 
---
I’ve put a ton of hours into this game and my frustration has been growing. Never cheated or done any duping. I’m still playing here and there when I can, but I’m gonna be really hesitant to give this company any more of my money unless I see some meaningful strides being made towards improving this hot mess that they released as a completed title. 
---
From where I’m sitting it seems like they just reskinned Skyrim as a cash grab. I get it that they probably needed a cash infusion to complete the next Elder Scrolls. Or if this was a test to work out kinks before the actual game they’re working on. That’s fine...but fucking say that then. I think we’d all be on board if it was reasonably priced and at least playable. But to pawn this off as a whole, fully functional game is just misleading consumers. And they’ve done a pretty thorough job of pissing off loyal customers. At least this one. 
---
Haven't noticed any of those. Anyone seen the white locker plan, the metal picnic table plan, or the park bench plan that is the very last of the bench variants?? Have checked every vender except the traveling robot. 
---
“It just works”
---
I only know that I have seen youtubers making videos about how much harder it is now and in their footage, they are STILL killing enemies faster than I am with TSE weapons. 
---
One guy actually complained that his gatling gun no longer does 1000 damage per shot. 
---
In other words, he's having to play like the rest of us now... except he isn't because his guns STILL do more damage. 
---
You also lose the photos when you delete the data/save file for 76. The game will still work, but the photos will be gone.
---
See that makes a lot of sense, except not for me.  I’m trying to be out and about. I go to the city on weekends because I live in a rural area that is really boring. No nieces, no nephews, lots of disposable income though.  I think I’m moving post gaming now, so only my most beloved franchises get me excited. 
---
As a Cincinnati sports fan, I am into toy familiar with this feeling.
---
&gt; Did it compile?!
---
yes
---
&gt; Did it link?

&gt; Can you launch the EXE?
---
&gt; Can it connect to a server?
---
&gt; ...
---
PROFIT!!!!!!!!!!!
---
SHIP IT!

-15 C in Ontario

What I find interesting is that they already stated that the hotfix would come either today or tomorrow, they could have easily taken a bit more time to test it.
---
You need acid + ore to smelt into usable scrap at the chemistry bench. For example, 2 acid and 2 iron ore gives you 5 steel scrap, or 2 acid and 5 uranium to create 3 nuclear material. Also, acid + cloth makes gunpowder, which is faster than farming it and cheaper than buying it. 
---
 I like to claim Poseidon for the fusion cores and lead processor (the concrete, aluminum, and uranium are nice too), and I'm camped on an acid node near Arktos Pharma. Every 30 minutes or so I get 3 cores and enough lead ore to make 15 lead scrap. Oh, and you can also squeeze 3 industrial water purifiers into the puddle and get 30 purified water per hour without using your own resources to build them. 
---
I would say it's a kneejerk reaction to all of the dupers and the sheer power of TSE weapons, but they took so long to even begin addressing the issues of the two combined. Not only that, but the nerfs affect everyone badly, so explosive builds are kind of ruined now. I hope they undo at least a fraction of what they did. :(
---
Do I have to do that every time I become over encumbered or is it more random than that?
---
Great. So you understand that "No one is forcing you to play" is an incredibly stupid argument when we're talking about a product that people already spent their hard-earned money on?
---
You understand that they want the game to be better, to work properly, and for Bethesda to stop royally screwing everything up so that they can play and enjoy the product that they paid for and get their money's worth?
---
no no they dont.  Nothing this sub says matters to me regarding what I do in game.
---
A lot of the time I just sit in game for literally a minute before doing anything...so I don't lock up.
---
Naw.
---
Todd bailed to some kind of VIP vault, or maybe an oil rig.  Nobody has seen that dirtbag since launch.
---
Sticking it to em I guess duper’s that is 
---
I play plenty of other games, it’s just my favorite. Mainly because dragons. And you get to craft/build/hoard stuff. That’s my jam. 
---
No. Vault Tech where actually competent at their jobs. 
---
The asshat who raged at me about stats will be in here to demand your proof!
---
Great post.  My wife's on hour 4, unbroken on PS4, with her "nerfed" TSE Handmade shooting and killing SB and MQ solo.  Cry me a river 1%.
---
because he, like many others whining here, are idiots and clearly dont know they are idiots and seem to need the education.
---
I've noticed it too, big time.
---
I didn't know there was a witches dress.  I've had one of my characters in the civil war dress and witches hat forever.
---
Will do.  I’ll start splitting the drops up
---
as an outsider, they broke the branch they were patching so badly they had to go back to a much older branch and try to fix something back there, that of course lost all the other fixes, so all the bugs have regressed.
---
I just can't believe they shipped a regression build.
---
On a side note, I love having to get out of PA to use things. Prevents me from accidentally taking naps or cooking breakfast while mid-combat. Yes I'm an idiot, and yes this would probably get me killed otherwise.
---
Holy shit guess I wont be buying any Bethesda games from now on, don't want to accidentally craft a gun or something and not be able to play Doom 2
---
Oh, give it a rest already. Yes, this sub is mostly populated by the most dedicated/hardcore fans. No, the general public "casual gamer" demographic does not, by and large, have a better opinion of the game than the hardcore do. The game has a 2.6 user rating on Metacritic, 2.5 stars across the board on Amazon, and similar from virtually every member of the gaming press. This pompous "you're only upset because you have no life" schtick is as delusional as it is obnoxious. No, the "casual gamers" aren't spamming Reddit with their complaints every day, but that doesn't mean they're just grinning through all of the objective problems that have earned this game historically terrible reviews, low sales and a meme-level reputation for being a cash-grabby garbage fire. I honestly don't know what you think you're accomplishing by plugging your ears and pretending this isn't the reality, besides patting yourself on the back for being a sycophant.
---
And your entire premise about "Oh the game is being tailored for the casuals because that's who really matters" is nonsense too. Everyone who's ever run any kind of business knows that [the most dedicated, hardcore fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) are where the vast majority of revenue comes from — these are the people pre-ordering on blind faith; the people buying the expensive limited-edition versions with all the fancy extras; the people spending money on microtransactions; the people keeping the servers alive by being active all the time; the people helping out the noobs by answering their questions or lending a hand in the game; the people creating content on social media, Twitch, and YouTube; and most importantly, the people begging their friends to take the chance and buy the game even though it got shitty reviews and has a terrible reputation. If *these people* aren't happy, your business is in trouble. No game studio cares about the people who buy one game every three months and play it for 5 hours a week, except to the extent that those people can be converted into dedicated fans by having a great experience. "Filthy casuals" are not the ones bringing in the big bucks.
---
Nooooo! Not my invisipoints!
---
More importantly, what did it break? 
---
Yeah my Xbox one x is now a souped up roku...
---
Just about everything they have done so far has had unforseen consequences. If you didn't expect more of the same, you haven't been paying attention.
---
despite my outrage at my account getting erroneously banned, i still love the fallout franchise so much that I desperately hope this can turn around. i agree with your sentiment and i hope that hopefully the higher ups realize what a problem they have and move their best talent off of starfield/ES and focus on fixing this game+releasing an acceptable amount of content
---
Mine never did that much damage. I thought my gun was OP when fighting groups of lower or equal level enemies. But when I fought a SB I realized that it wasn't as bad ass as I thought. Also I blew myself up nearly as much as I did the enemy. It had its drawbacks. I'm just frustrated because I'm obviously not doing something right and I can't figure out what because me three star legendary is no better than a not legendary that I can build.
---
Loving this idea, and your additions.
---
I solo'd Belly of the Beast and just barely got through, but I did do it, so yeah, that's just screwed. And the whole respec when you gain a level is a joke too. They don't want anyone to respec at all. They want you to create new characters and replay the game over and over with different builds. It's obvious because most of the challenges require different builds. Well guess what, I don't want to start over and I like using energy weapons. Always have. I shouldn't have to play any way I don't want to just for Atoms. Besides even though they don't consider it an MMO, it really is. Well good MMOs have higher tiered gear that is gotten through tough events. But really only the SBQ comes to mind. And then they just weakened the most powerful weapons. The only real issue was that TSE was useable in PVP and that people could duplicate it. I am no expert on what's required to rebalance, but if you just weaken the best weapons, then nobody has end game gear. It's all just average. They probably should have just made it so PVP just deactivates legendary effects and actually fixed the duplication exploits all along.
---
Random but it fixed it? Always works for me
---
Lol!  We've got an insider here!
---
Obivious rage post but i have to add that my 200% repaired TSE Dragon broke after 3 shots today
---
I always found them at the train stations. I also spent 4 weeks daily running the train stations from R+G, Lewisburg, Walsh to Grafton etc looking for the heavy variations of all the armors. So I could be confused by all the traveling.
---
Bethesda is not a small indie game studio. It is actually one of the older studios around. 
---
https://www.zenimax.com/about
---
Definitions of words change a lot in history, holding Bethesda to an outdated definition just to throw a hissy fit is stupid, I don't care what it meant before, it doesn't mean that anymore so this entire post is pointless.
---
Pfff don't agree. My heavy Gunner is a pile of shit right no. Every fucking super mutant eats up like 100 rounds of cal. 50
---
Commando build also. I will have to farm for ammo the whole day just to take out a couple of enemies^^
---
Yeah fuck this guy. Every video he posts he's gushing how a couple of bug fixes are "THE BEST UPDATE EVER!". He's a shill through and through. 
---
Yep, lots of us are. Let the game chill out and fully load before doing anything... unfortunate, but that's what I've taken to doing lately. It's smooth after that initial first load/login.
---
Weapon artisan in the int tree
---
Lol yep
---
No.  But they claim to be looking at them and claim to be increasing it soon.
---
Just playing devil's advocate here, but:
---
From where are you pulling your percentages? They smell as much like ass as the ones you complain about.
---
We will all log in and all the quitters can drop items at Sutton station and we can have an Easter egg hunt lol
---
I’m level 10, I play maybe an hour here and there when I’m not playing other games. I like to put on my noob gear and build my base like a happy camper who occasionally gets my little cabin set on fire. I haven’t seen some of the complaints people of had about weapons and drops because I haven’t gotten to that point yet. 
---
Weapon Artisan - Intelligence
---
Bump! 
---
And thanks for sharing.
---
They fix so much because every patch comes with new problems to be fixed. It's a never-ending cycle. I'm moving on to other highly anticipated games. Save this conversation and in 78 more days come tell me it's all fixed and I'll concede. I played it through the bugs and exploits and still managed to do everything it had to offer. I can't say I didn't get my money worth, but you can only be patient for so long. I'm just more impatient than you.
---
All these positive comments but I guess somebody had to come along to shit on OP’s opinion eventually
---
Doesn’t apply to my melees
---
Same
---
If you want to get it repaired for free sometimes, try using that one weapon repair luck card, can’t remember the name. I believe if you use both weapon artisan and this it’ll repair it to 130 percent for free.
---
You where making your money using cap stashes? 
---
Well said. DAMN well said. This deserves to be top billing on this sub for a while. It gets so annoying that the same handful people who live to shit all over this game seem to think they are the voice of the people. Most everyone I’ve talked to who plays were frustrated with this last patch (myself included), but the general reaction to it has been “meh, it’s annoying but it’ll get fixed. Anyways, want to team up tonight?”. 
---
Got a message on youtube the other day about one of my tutorial videos. The video was a tutorial on how to hack terminals in 76, nothing big or super detailed, but the message I got was “how much does Bethesda pay you to act like you have fun playing this trash?”. Yeah, sure, I have 42 subscribers on YouTube and my tutorial series gets maybe less than a hundred views per video, but I’m totally sponsored by Bethesda, you can obviously see it in my numbers... 
---
Can confirm, accidentally unbulked  7 steel. Now I gotta go back and farm more plastic... 
---
Hey buddy do you still have this ===&gt;  **Level 45** 3\* Weightless Assault Marine Armor Chest Piece reduces damage while sprinting by 15% +1 agility--- ?? :)
---
I think shuffling perks is the issue not micromanaging bobbypins. Since pins have no weight and u can sell them to vendors which makes them kinda brokeish item imo.
---
Bring it. Let's play ricochet shots only.
---
Man this Vault-Tec experiment is getting out of hand.
---
Basically Carl+R and you can replace anything with one string to another. Must be hard to do. 
---
I remember last time I tried with my keyboard I just kept missing the letter and finally took me three days straight before I can get to that. 
---
I can’t team up fuck
---
especially those screws.  
---
I looted the stash inside Whitespring bunker on patch day and it has not refilled since
---
Loved them zork games for sure.
---
We've got to go deeper. You need to make a post complaining about the posts that are complaining about the complaint posts
---
Depends on which side is currently on.  Say it one way if you get down votes change it to the other way.  Balanced.
---
Need to combine with Makeshift Warrior. 
---
Maybe be more accurate so u dont waste so much ammo?
---
For one you can easily peruse someone's profile and post history. Secondly employees are not allowed to do that. Companies can and will have their staff banned for pulling stunts like that. It's not a sub issue, it's a reddit rule.
---
The numbskulls above just want to try and troll a good post because it doesn't join in on their little hate boner circlejerk. 
---
Sorry were you on the other side ? Lol
---
Ewww. The fishing process itself would be interesting, but would your character really want to eat one of those three-eyed fish like Blinky (from the effluent river next to the Springfield power plant in The Simpson’s? )
---
They could have just required higher levels to equip it. Level 50 is the highest level of seen as a requirement. They wouldn't even need to nerf it for pvp. If your health increased with every level gain by so many points per endurance instead of just being what it is based on your current endurance then you couldn't one shot other high level players. A level 400 should be able to one shot a level 10 in pvp. But only on pvp servers. There shouldn't be pvp in adventure mode and open pvp in survival. Problem solved.
---
You were right from the start, are you happy now ?
---
Cool any other recommendations?
---
To be fair, I've seen quite a few multiplayer game launches that were worse than this. 
---
I mean, we could at least play the game during the first week, which is better than Anarchy Online or the Aion launch. 
---
And the game's first  quest to interact with a node that could only be used by one player at a time, thus causing a massive stack up of thousands of new players trying to all click it at once.... like Tabula Rasa did.
---
Fo76 isn't good... but it for sure is not the worst.
---
I would say a majority of developers disagree with you. Thats like taking locking pliers and telling a mechanic "no they're called vice grips"
---
Do the majority of people who dont know any better call them vice grips? Yes. Does that mean its correct? No. Vice grips are a brand, not the tool themselves. 
---
You can misuse the terms all you want, its just going to make people who know the difference think you're an idiot who doesnt know whst they're talking about.
---
This a great website to play with different builds. 
---
the first serum gives you the mutation....the second will only suppress the negative effects for 1 hr i believe.
---
Unless you have hundreds of extra serum it a waste IMO.
---
I think the gameplay experience improves with each character. My main has no real defined build, and it shows.
---
My alt is a stealth sniper and kicks butt. And less then 1/2 the level size! 
---
At some point I’ve got revisit my main and figure out what it wants to be, but like you and others under no rush.
---
Oh no, not another unacceptable thing from Bethesda that fanboys won't ultimately ignore because it never directly impacted them!
---
Dude I know the pain every morning I wake up that I put my socks on and they aren’t crusty and stuff I know it’ll be a good day
---
*EDIT: Just googled this, Fallout 4 came out Nov 10th, 2015. First DLC was March 2016 (Automatron) the first REAL game expansion, Far Harbor, was in May. FO76 is in no way behind schedule for content update compared to the previous game.*
---
It is when what we got was a broken mess unworthy of being called a "release build", game is still a broken beta build. 
---
Fallout 4 is a singleplayer game, 76 is a live-service multiplayer game. Your comparison is like saying it would be okay for each iteration of Destiny to have no DLC because Halo didn't have any (barring map packs). It's the industry standard for this type of game to have a steady stream of new content and this is exactly around the time the first DLC should be dropping - instead the game has actually been rolled backwards. 
---
I agree that making a huge fuss about that alone is going over the top but it's important to remember it's not *just* the lack of new content, it's that ontop of *everything* else, bearing in mind not only all the in-game shit but also that the nerds in this sub are the ones who bought misadvertised rum bottles and duffle bags and probably had their personal info shown to strangers. 
---
I also think it's misguided to think Bethesda prioritise casual players over the hard-core ones. The only thing Bethesda cares about is money. It's the hard-core players that provide the revenue at this stage, not the casual ones. They're the ones that'll be pissing away their money on shit microtransactions for potentially years to come. At this point new players aren't likely to buy the game full price, or even first hand, and the existing casuals already bought the game. 
---
Big rigs over the road racing.
---
It's a more complete and finished game. 
---
My grenades are such shit now.
---
No, also i think there was a shadow nerf to getting mods from scrapping armor. 
---
I've been scrapping a metric fuckton for the last few days and unlocked all but 2 mods for marine. I was making 35lvl arms and scrapping them. This would also give me mods for other pieces. So far I would get a mod every 12 pieces or so, so 8% chance. Today I made \~35 pieces and scrapped them. No mods. 
---
So something's up. Either they nerfed the chance to get mods even further or now you can get mods for a part only from scrapping that specific part. 
---
TL;DR I scrapped 35 marine arms, looking for a chest mod, got nada. Possible nerf. 
---
All of the time. Even way back before the most recent patches. 
---
Yes! We need more complaint layers. An infinite amount of complaint posts, each complaining about the previous one. I like the way you think.
---
Lmao!
---
This happened to me but I stood there waiting for a few minutes, it eventually gave me loot but it’s clearly fucked. 
---
I usually have this issue when I just teleported or joined server.
---
I can’t even team up at the moment at all on PS4
---
Noone cares about your feelings or if you uninstall. They already have your money and statistics say you WILL play it again. Because the DLC is free and at some point you will come back.
---
Want to make a change? Leave constructive feedback, use the bug tracker created by us the player base and send well thought out facts and examples.. not blah blah you're dumb I'm out posts. 
---
Look at what WE have done as a community, we have a trade hub, public launch codes site, a food calculator, and so much more. Show support and interest, take the reigns and lead by example... Or sit in a corner throwing fecal matter at all passerby. 
---
Starting to think it's all interns maybe. 
---
tou·ché I think you may have just convince me just for that. Right before I got too far, I’m lvl 69 so I’ve got some room to change.
---
It says what it says
---
Yeah it does. 
---
I bought FO76 on release.   I bought KH3 on release.  I've already almost sank as many or more hours into the latter, and it just proves to me how much more I would've enjoyed literally any of the other games of 2018 more.
---
Mind you, I put at least 30 hours in 76 hoping for the best.  Bethesda's lack of polish has always been overwhelmed by a superior amount of content and things to do, but when you see another company easily obliterate all expectations for return on time invested...
---
P.s., if you're a fan and on the fence about KH3...  buy it!!!
---
You're in for a big surprise if you think the actual developers use that "dev" room. The majority of the time they are used by other employees, such as community team members to check on reports from users (ie - verify something is functioning in the way it is being reported).
---
Thank you for this
---
I just very clearly repaired my axe with it equipped. Can you confirm it on your game?
---
No, Democracy over Totalitarianism and the tyranny of the minority.
---
VIP vault 76. Cleared out all those annoying residents on a fool's errand while he lives out his days in luxury. Even shelled out for some experimental rad treatment for life extension.
---
bro it does trust me i use it all the time to fix my knife and hammers
---
I has to.
---
Move the cursor of the item and then back. Usually it does not show the percentage correctly right after you repair.
---
Makes me laugh every time. 
---
Heat wave in Southeast Ohio at 16
---
I agree. This was a combination test and cash grab. I don’t think anyone would be bitching if this was a DLC for Fallout 4, with the understanding that it’s basically a BETA. But to market this game as a complete, fully functional stand alone game with the price tag to prove it is absolute bullshit. 
---
I can’t bitch too much because I’ve gotten my (albeit frustratingly) money’s worth out of the game. Probably at least 100 hours or so in, level 70 now. And for the most part I’ve enjoyed playing it, but I’ve also nearly thrown my controller into my TV on numerous occasions. I stuck by it because I know Bethesda games are notoriously glitchy, and I assumed they would fix most of the issues, but each patch seems to just make matters worse. And they have people running their own testing and stuff and flat out telling Bethesda what the problems are with their code but things still aren’t getting fixed. I’m to the point now where I feel like they need a message sent to them by the loyal customers they’ve pissed off. Companies only give a shit about their bottom line. You have to hit them in the pocket book if you want anything to change. If we allow them to release another broken title and we all immediately gobble it up and give them our money, why would they bother to do things differently? Same with the micro transactions. If we refuse to buy things at the price they have them at, they’ll at least lower the prices. As long as people are buying overpriced armor skins though, what incentive do they have to change anything? 
---
I saw this too today.
---
I hated TSE so idk about others but I actually agree with the specific nerfs. Is more about a "gameplay desing" critic where the game just looses some or it's best parts due to balance issue, specially regarding the unrealistic bullet-sponginess of the end game enemies.
---
I’d come back if they did this ontop of a new content drop
---
This reminds me of the holo tape where the kid asks the robot to get his cat out of the tree. It did not end well for the cat.
---
I most definitely confirm that weapon artisan repairs it all the way .. look at the weapon again. Does it have a double bar of health now maybe? 
---
I pre-ordered this one as I have the other fallout/skyrim games that were able to be pre-ordered.  The one effect this shitshow has on me, is that when the next fallout/skyrim comes out, I will not be pre-ordering, but rather waiting a month after release to see the reviews and then decide from there.  That's a huge shift for me.
---
This has happened to me since I bought the game in November. I just swing around and hope for the best. It usually works
---
No. I know what it looks like being beyond the repair bar, it doesn’t apply to my Grognaks axe at the least
---
Dude you could literally buy TSE shotguns on the Xbox looking for group thing for 500 caps, so your claim is bullshit. There are plenty of weapons I’ve seen sold here in the 2000 range too, and if you think that’s out of the range of the casual player then your very mistaken
---
On it's second sale point, sure.  Maybe 3rd.  Pre order? LMFAO, no way.  Retail? not going to happen.
---
My hole heavy Gunner Build is a piece of shit right now.
---
It was the two shot and explosion damage what made heavy guns viable. Without this they just suck. Every fucking super mutant eats up like 100 rounds 
---
Yeah and words can’t describe apes like you either, I mean all other fallouts/elder scrolls were perfect right? You didn’t have to download an unofficial patch to make it “playable”
---
If ya can't put the fire out with your hands, Why spend the money on a bucket of water?
---
lol we used to say that in Eve Online too
---
only weapon that cant be over repaied is grognaks axe. they say they are aware
---
Lol that have this it's called a play timer and it's the only thing a company cares about so OP is right.
---
Source?
---
More than 150 dmg after the 100th shot. There might be a cap to it. I am not sure. Like most things in this game, it needs to be tested.
---
Request: stop being toxic 
---
Not a new issue. I’ve had it happen a lot on PS4. My guess is they’ve already loaded on the server side, but not client side.
---
I’ve also had enemies that were just a long stretched out line with an impossible to tag hitbox.
---
Need incisor and martial artist in Strength. 
---
I’d honestly say 6 is a good idea
---
Why are you guys still playing? Cut your losses. Let it die.
---
Quote which part of the holotapes you believe says he was turned immediately. Burden of proof is on the one making the claim.
---
Love it !
---
Reasons I consider this a shit post, there's a number of people who didn't take part in the duping, XP exploiting the spawns at white springs (that ALL of the people on this sub just seemed to love despite it being a clear cheap shortcut), cap glitches, dev exploits, or any of the others, who are just as upset as the rest because now our ability to progress through the game at a legitimate rate, and the rewards we'll receive, have been fucked into the ground.
---
I highly doubt it's dupers with every legendary combination they wanted who are unhappy about SBQ loot still being broken, I doubt it's cap exploiters who are upset about the ridiculous price spikes on plans, I doubt it's bobblehead glitchers who feel like the build they worked hard on has been screwed by perk card adjustments to stop the community from whoring out a weapon that was obviously going to be nerfed (TSE was never gonna last and anyone who could see what it was doing to the game's economy knew that), and so on and so on.
---
If anything the people who didn't exploit the game and these shortcuts are the ones most stifled by the changes as now, you'll never get a TSE if you don't already have one (basically anyone who wasn't purposely farming legendaries), you'll have to invest weeks of playtime to buy plans people who cap glitched and server hopped bought from vendors already, and days more legitimately leveling up to readjust your build (whereas people who boosted XP have a number of respec points just sitting on standby to move around as they please after getting to Level 150+).
---
Contrary to the picture this thread attempts to paint, there's a number of people pissed about Demo Expert's nerf because it was done to curb the dominating power of TSE, yet completely screwed over any other explosive build in the process a post by a guy who just played with his wife and did crowd control via his missile launcher comes to mind. Grenades aren't even worth the weight it takes to carry them. In the process of nerfing both explosives and rifles, melee builds weren't retuned at all, making them ridiculously god tier at this point (people are killing Scorchbeasts and Queens in 3-6 Sledgehammer swings vs hundreds of explosives and thousands of bullets).
---
Which is why there's such uproar this time, it's like trying to clean a stain and instead just smearing it and making a bigger mess. The ripple effects are getting bigger and bigger.
---
Oh, I had that
---
Didn’t realise it was a bug, as it was the first time I’d used it
---
Promptly removed it because I couldn’t see enemies through it unless I was hip firing...
---
Grognaks axe is messed up u cannot over repair it with weapon artesian at the moment
---
Does it need to be repaired? Are you on PC?
---
I have friends who duped and they are waiting until they add vending machines to offload their stuff. Most dupers had a mule so this doesn’t really affect them to bad, although it does kind of screw up player vending for the rest of us who didn’t do anything 
---
We eat 2-headed Brahmin and Radstags, Mirelurks and their eggs. Some of us have even taken to cannibalism. Is a 3-eyed fish really that much worse? 
---
you are not alon in the struggle . hope it gets resolved soon
---
You are about the only person that has played this game with no issues. Maybe you can accept multiple disconnects a day, having monsters disappear or change completely mid fight. Kill legendary or rare mobs only to have their corpses disappear within half a second? Sorry, either you play with your head in the sand or you are a paid Bethesda troll. 
---
It really does... lol
---
... I don’t get it 
---
It's an alternate perspective, but it's a shit perspective.  Really, you are either trolling, or you just love to be abused and disrespected by a company that you pay money to.
---
Your ilk is why the games industry continuously feel comfortable abusing their customers, and I think you likely are a low intelligence gamer. 
---
Yup... it’s pretty obvious this was a cash grab for something. I was willing to let that slide if it was for another Elder Scrolls game, hell if they had come out and said they needed a cash infusion to make it I probably would have donated the damn money, but I feel deceived now. This was marketed as a fully functional stand alone game and it’s just not. It’s a BETA, at best...and it should have been a $20-30 DLC for Fallout 4. 
---
We do, because the TSE is STILL far better than any normal weapon
---
Todd bailed with Maxson and Codsworth to Vault 69, located in Microtransactionia, Hawaii
---
Sorry to hear my man you sound like a great bloke.
---
i hope all works out for you and you get what you deserve which is respect and admiration for having to go though this and still being a strong individual. :) :)
---
Don’t shoot mirelurks in their back. Their shell is thick. 
---
Yeah. Maybe they'll stumble on this post. You're 100% correct. That is probably the best way to balance it. And they could introduce better gear with new content; it would feel organic if they followed what you said. Unfortunately, this will likely not happen. 😔
---
&gt;This sub is not normal. you are not the "average" player of this game. The fact is, the 171,000 people on this subreddit are not a representative sample of FO76 players. This sub is a tiny, a teeny-tiny percent of everybody that plays the game. You all should know it. This sub has repeatedly posted stats showing how small of a fraction of players have killed a SBQ, or even have hit level 50...  
---
&gt;But that self-awareness is lost, again as evidenced by a simple reading of the current top ranking post about not defending Bethesda. It includes the line "The vast majority of us..."  
---
Heres the problem I have with this. It is a very simple one. Show me the community of FO76 players that is filled with people that are happy, etc etc. Show me that this is the vast majority. Show me that they arent just begrudgingly playing. Show me that there isnt an even larger group that owns the game that isnt even involved in the community right now because of how big a mess it is. I have a friend who bought it around thanksgiving time. HE played it a couple times, and stopped. He is waiting for the game to be fixed before playing again. He doesnt want to deal with the growing pains that the game is going through. You are talking about a mythical group that we have no proof of existing, much less that they are some sort of silent majority.

Every 4 weeks: 1 minute, multiple choice/slide indicators of how players feel about 2 or 3 quick subjects. The data can be extrapolated at the end of the 1st week, implement over the next 3, rinse repeat.

Anyone who provides 3x reviews in a row will receive 100 atoms for their input.

*Bam, world peace*
---
It's understandable, and thankfully our right as consumers.  
---
Many players feel let down.
---
I submitted a service ticket for missing a quest item for order of mysteries.  Didnt get the Holotape after returning from Lewisburg. Got a response back next day asking if I can confirm the problem still exists.
---
Went back to ingame and it was there waiting for me.
---
I’m on pc.
---
Confirm it. On your game. I’m very clearly repairing a grognaks axe without it working
---
*Then
---
"I don't know you and I don't care to know you."
---
I've literally never downloaded an unofficial patch. Just because a company keeps lowering your expectations doesnt mean its suddenly okay for them to stop trying. Your logic is so bad its laughable

Yes on xbox the photos are saved in the games temp cache 
---
So getting hit once by a sledge hammer killing you in one hit at level 75 by a level 56 is better for you? 
---
Shit game with shit management.
---
You can hit +6 from alcohol with the charisma perk. 
---
It’s lack of control. What quality you are talking about?
---
You got some pretty good ideas. Agree with everything except the buffs back to two-shot and explosive haha
---
This isn’t that. But it’s still funny. The simple reason is they’re trying to get rid of the games. I honestly doubt that Bethesda is willing to buy back unused stock and they could throw it away or use it to sell other items to still make profit
---
Unyielding / Cavalier
---
new melee weapon, junk fishing rod. low damage. slow swing speed. allows for fishing in deep water. 
---
comes with bladed, heavy, rocketed, spiked, and flaming mods that increase damage, but make it harder to fish. 
---
I don't get it. I crafted and scrapped hundreds of items for mods in one sitting and I'm not banned yet. Just how many do you have to craft to get banned? Thousands? How do you come up with all those mats without duping?
---
Oh you shouldn't uninstall!  It exciting to see what bugs are cooked up each time!
---
Well shit.
---
Atom shop sales is how they’re making a bit of money.
---
Yes, you can. I just got rid of about 300 extra oil by selling. 
---
\&gt; If you think TSE was over powered. You need to educate your self. Bobble Exploits and Sneak builds made TSE seem OP. When reality since Beta Melee builds can hit 10,000k dps builds and can still now isn’t overpowered?
---
Getting tired of this argument. Just b/c melee didn't get nerfed yet doesn't mean it's not also OP. 
---
Why nerf TS and E first? What if it's a much smaller and straightforward change to tweak the numbers for two legendary prefixes that are clearly problematic and would only affect level 50+ players compared to rebalancing melee damage which could affect everyone from level 1 to 50+ depending on how you did it? 
---
Also I thought they did in fact patched away bobblehead stacking so the "exploit" doesn't exist anymore? 
---
Either way it doesn't affect my point. Even if nothing else was nerfed up until now except TS and E it doesn't mean everything else is just fine. This is broken logic.
---
Bethesda just got their plans for fallout 5: Newaii! Mother and child must work together to stop an eruption with a nuke!
---
Maybe nukes shouldn't only cater to high level players in PA. I can solo silos at 35 with a non-PA shotgun VATS build but once I do, I can't benefit at all from the zone.
---
You're entire suggestion is to fuck over non-PA players and low level players alike. People already don't clean up glowing ones that get left over from nukes right now and they shit all over low level characters with very little they can do.
---
No. Not happy. We would rather be wrong from the start. 
---
I may end up buying TES6 if I see them actually make some meaningful strides towards fixing this game, but I’m sure as fuck not pre-ordering this time. Fool me once...well, you know the saying. 
---
I just think as a community we need to send them a message that this is not acceptable, and the only way they’re going to get that message is if we hit them in the pocket book where it counts. 
---
this game sucks im not really sure how anyone defends it, complete failure. How anyone defends this im not sure
---
Sadly, Bethesda actually took requests for changes directly off this reddit. I been reading this everyday so I have an idea what will be in these patches before they come out.
---
It just became popular on here to act like the angriest, foul mouthed, pouting child so Bethesda will make the changes that that person wants. 
---
I personally hope the developers ignore this reddit and just make the big future patches that the game needs. No game was perfect in the first 6 months 
---
Can I get a link? Would love to read future plans for the game.
---
Yeah, the group was bigger on handmade though it didn't look too bad.  Handmade has a huge hip fire, and i think recoil, compared to hunting rifle though.  Curious how much the pattern difference is for same gun with same mods.  
---
At least you didn't convince them to install Brink.
---
Whatever good this patch was supposed to bring got implemented badly.
---
\- We get a (known) tag next to plans that we know. Good thing.
---
  Unfortunately it somehow got mixed up with mods and if you have a mod in your inv/stash the game will show at the vendor that you also know the plan for the mod. The tag itself isn't really a tag but a name change so now you got your plans all mixed up. The tag is... well.. big, so if the plans name is long you can't see the whole name without inspecting. a PITA when trading plans with other people.
---
\- Cap stashes and cap collector got a serious nerf.
---
\- Most of the plans cost 3-3.5 times of what they used to
---
\- Minor mix up with junkand bulking. Hopefully fixed by now. 
---
Show me where they touched you on this doll
---
Point is, bulk it and take it off and sell it. You don’t need to scrap anything during that process. 
---
What majority of developers?
---
He isn’t being toxic. What’s wrong with you?
---
I don't believe you.
---
I always assumed that it was because fishing wasn't a huge enterprise in the desert. Fish seemed fairly plentiful in Far Harbor, though.
---
Yea all these people saying you shouldn't be able to one shot stuff ,I am lvl 250 why shouldn't I be able to one shot a creature 1/3 my lvl
---
I never said remasters were inherently bad business practices, i explicitly stated that i believe that remasters can and have been done right, however the way most remasters have been done are in my opinion bad business practice.
---
 I think you have a narrow definition of bad business practice. IMO if a game does nothing to improve upon what it has already created and still charges full price, that is bad business practice. A game that tosses in MTX into a remaster is bad business practice. there are many ways for a remaster to be have bad business practices in them and a lot of them do.
---
I sure did.
---
Yo I can't believe people thought pgh would win that game. It was the LAST EVER OAKLAND RAIDERS HOME GAME against their storied rivals. The lnfks rigged and I'm sure when Heinz Field is finally gone one day either the Bengals browns Ravens or Pat's are gonna take an ass beating in the final home game too
---
why would anyone buy from that store in the first place. overpriced garbage
---
God, I wish I checked the sub-Reddit before I just un-bulked everything in my inventory.
---
Correct. Has a few different meanings, but similar idea. In our company, a hotfix is just something that's deployed to live rather than going through staging -&gt; live.
---
Yeah this bug has been around since it’s release.
---
Look at how many people refunded the game, Bethesda has to get some elder scrolls 6 money from somewhere lmao.
---
... and you had to be the first reply, care to elaborate or do you just wanted to track some? For anyone who's been grinding solo, this feature will be a real eye-opener., any time I've mentioned it. Someone said thank you I didn't know about it. Is there anything else you would like to add?
---
#billsmafia
---
Ive been building dozens of limbs looking for buttressed, hundreds of pieces and thousands of materials. still haven’t gotten buttressed 
---
Boom 
---
At some point in the past yeah. Today I just made a few runs to see how it changed. 
---
I was sexually abused as a child too. It's OK, and it wasn't our fault. We don't HAVE to accept things like this as normal.
---
This is what I do. I rarely scrap anything between the stash box and the vendor bot. 
---
Wikipedia, so its obviously legitimate. Its not like anyone who wants to can exit those pages /s
---
You didn't "need" to make it
---
What did it have on it?
---
I just checked the LFG. The point is what am I supposed to be so awe struck by? People looking to trade items? People looking to buy? How about nuke drops? What was so unbelievable?
---
something something "Edit" something something Thanks kind stranger
---
It was zenimax, a studio founded by zenimax at least, it’s now Bethesda Austin team 
---
To us it is. Some people will spend their money on dog shit.
---
OP is gonna pretend you don't exist because you don't fit his narrative when in all actuality, people who have played this game for hundreds of hours, and taken part in all the exploits, are literally the least affected and likely least upset by these changes because they have access to any weapon/perk/amount of caps they want already due to having cheated the system for months.
---
Yeah, exactly why I’m annoyed. They knew the game was hot garbage but they released it anyway under false pretenses. This is not a standalone title, and it should not have been marketed as such, at least not in the state that it’s in. This should have been a DLC for Fallout 4, with the understanding that it’s a BETA and priced accordingly. 
---
If it's in beta why does it cost $60 and why did the "beta" have a beta? (Plus all the microtransactions). 
---
I'm a Steeler fan in pgh area. No way the NFL was gonna have the raiders lose their last ever home game in Oakland to their storied rival. Saw that loss a mile away.
---
You buy a second copy of the game for this? 
---
Run any mods?
---
Only if I have lots of butter made from the irradiated milk of a Brahmin...or I could just grab a few bottles of 25-year old cream from the Cow Spots Creamery.
---
Haha dude you are doing so much right now
---
Glad to see the king of fallout 4 settlements back.
---
Think about all the people who said this about ESO, ya'll
---
So if you lose an item you have to farm for it again, duh! :)
---
What?
---
2 months after another patch. How’re you guys doing?
---
Max your strength and get full unyielding armor for 30 strength. Use radicool. Get a bloodied super sledge.
---
Yeah, there’s so many other useful perks in Agility that a pistol build is heavily hampered, because you have to choose between pistol specific damage perks (and there’s no armor piercing...) and other perks like Adrenaline, Stealthy, etc. 
---
I’ve got a 15per 15agi 15luck stealth vats sniper I would like to use pistols on.... but they’re so much worse than rifles when I start looking at perks that I just forget it. 
---
I for one appreciate this alternative take on the miss steps on FO76. I'm frustrated as well and understand a game like FO76 is challenging to bring to market in the state it's in. I'll take a break until the next update. I enjoyed the game, will again. 
---
"Sometimes there just aren't enough rocks" -Forrest Gump
---
Um... All of the other damage perks, the 3 point ones, only give +20%. It takes ***9 points*** to get to +60. Demo expert was 100 for 5 points. Now it's 60 for 5 points. 5 points in any of the other damage perk lines gets you, at most, +40%.
---
That was gross.
---
From what I can see it would be Microsoft giving them small change 
---
Luck of the Draw repairs your weapon while using, but it doesn’t go over 100%
---
If you’re trying to bring attention to the LFG then technically you did but this entire post screams that there should be something worth seeing. You could’ve also simply made a post saying. Xbox has an LFG section
---
Mine is fine other than the occasional crash. I believe that most of these whiney babies are just over reacting. People are sissies nowadays.

Goddamn, that's a crappy bug. :( Thanks for posting about it here, definitely saved my hoarding butt from losing plastic and time.
---
To sell to vendors. 
---
No source other than the 10 other posts I've seen about it in the past
---
The Long Dark as well. If you love survival games, that is a must play!
---
Most of them don't even let us know why. They just say "I've been a supporter of this game, but I can't defend them anymore!"
---
I am, i literally just made a post about this too.
---
That's 5x more than its worth, according to this article. 
---
Lol thanks bro
---
no
---
Todd keeps making me "Lick The Wrinkly Hot Dog". He says it's part of the main quest, but unfortunately I just got some shitty title, and this weird "Adoring Fan" guy keeps following me around asking if he can fondle my buttocks.
---
Why there are such better ways 
---
There's a terminal in shelby's shack that lists cryptids as being things like grafton monster, snallygaster, and mothman, and another monster, but not mirelurks. I don't know if they were missed off that list for some reason but as far as I know, mirelurks aren't under the cryptid category. Strange that it would work with one though, maybe it only counts a particular type of mirelurk (say, killclaw or strangler mirelurks)?
---
Haha I said source to someone. I just want proof because  he very clearly said it was confirmed by someone
---
There was a huge marketing push around mods coming to the console versions of the special editions. 
---
Those mods are made by the most enthusiastic of PC gamers and if not enough of the PC playerbase switched to the special edition (because they could already mod it to be better for free) then there would be no mods to drive up console sales.
---
Logged off for the night. I’ll let her marinate for a little while

Someone get this dick weasel out of here. You're fucking through in this town, do you hear me? Buddy, you're done. I may not be a SoundCloud rapper, but this is a wrap. You're toast, with jam, my man. I'm literally and figuratively serving that ass on a plate with corn beef hash and grits. Guess what, there's extra butter in them because the kid is so gatdurn smooth with these disses. Your Reddit career is over. Anything more to say?

Yeah, didn't think so, pally.

Holy shit someone post this to r/jesuschristreddit or r/drama, I fucking snapped.

Definitely a valid point.

You didn't lose anything. It's just not bulked anymore.

Not to mention playing the game every single day since it came out. 
---
Microsoft: "here bethesda, heres all the money in my pocket, its only a couple thousand but maybe it will help"
---
Bethesda: "SWEET! thanks dude, now we can afford to add an arbitrary and asinine microtransaction system to TES 6, I hope the playerbase likes $10 ingame dragon plushies"
---
Microsoft: *facepalm*
---
Theres also plenty of positivity from a lot of the players. Not everyone posting is angry and burning flags, many are just frustrated.
---
I have not had any breaking issues with this game thus far.... but when you literally cant even hit play that's a problem lol
---
I already had, someone must have -ve you
---
Yeah I actually haven't bothered to play the game since late December, not because of the state of the game but I guess it wasn't what I expected it to be. Its still installed just haven't touched it. Maybe if we all uninstalled the game they would just shut the servers down instead. 
---
An idea but,
---
immagine the triple size nuke in a game that crashes just too much even now. 
---
And they should because they are Legendaries. Why farm a gun that perform like the normal guns?
---
First off; developers as in the individuals actually creating the patch, as i said in my previous post many people, including community managers misuse the terms. 
---
I can say that eveey developer i met, and all my teachers who taught software development knew the difference between a patch and a hotfix.
---
What most people call a hotfix is known as an interim patch in development. But interim patch is a lot less catchy than "hot fix" so normies use that instead, incorrectly.
---
"a little grindy" "months of the same raid"=??
---
I’m still enjoying it, go outside and have some fun man lol
---
Hey man, fair. Do you. It brought me enjoyment. Can't say I don't get it. This game makes you chase down ever changing info from increasingly obscure or inaccurate sources, so really, I get it.
---
I thought this was another hate BGS/FO76 post but I was wrong.  I enjoyed reading this and this game.  And I'm playing this game after work.  What a mystery this is.
---
I’ve got over 100 hours in the game. Stuck by it initially, assuming they would fix the issues. They haven’t, and as unstable as the game is I’m not confident the engine is even fixable. They fix one thing and break two others in the process. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’ve mostly enjoyed playing the game, it’s fun if you have the patience to do shit over every time the server or game crashes, which is often. But this last patch has rendered the game basically unplayable, and at this point I just feel like they can’t be arsed with putting a lot of time/resources into fixing it. They got our money already, what do they care? Only way they’re gonna get the memo is if we refuse to preorder their next release at the very least. Companies only understand numbers, so hitting their bottom line is the only way they’re really going to hear us. 
---
I can see it already
---
I liked to farm stashes because at the same run I could farm magazines, bubble heads, .45 ammo, steel and lead.
---
Best thing to do is don't open the Pip-boy until your weapons can switch and be reloaded until it gets fixed.
---
Amen.
---
Pretty sure he's one of the millions of fans who love the Oakland Raiders.
---
i had a similar issue with my flamer, sledge hammer, and minigun, where ghouls where self healing once they hit 1 health remaining, none of them where legendary and i had to switch weapons to kill them each time
---
MoSt people except apologies in cash. If you feel as bad as you say reimburse them the cost of the game 
---
171k is not a representative of the player base? It’s only a teeny tiny percentage of the player base? I’ve heard that there are only like 400k players even playing this game and it’s dropping. And we are the most passionate ones. So I’m not sure how right you are. The reason only a tiny percent have gotten the trophy for killing a SBQ is not because they’re casual players and don’t play in that game style, it’s because they quit the game long before they ever got to that’s end game portion. So I’d say out of the people STILL playing we ARE the majority. 
---
Could not agree more, [I mean look at Bethesda the Mod Author community has been try to provide fixes to you since the BETA. You are still ignoring us and not using them..](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aljowa/bethesda_the_mod_author_community_has_been_try_to/)
---
Personally I wouldn’t mind fishing if only to see just how bad the food would be considering our knowledge of how this words big companies got into the practice of dumping waste into the water along with any chemicals and failed experiments they didn’t want to dispose of properly. Would be fun to find a fish only to find out it’s toxic as fuck. 
---
I said most Casuals probably spent real money on TSE versus hardcore Grinders. Who could grind to get the caps to buy those guns from traders.
---
It doesn't, but it involves carrying bulked product on you, which was the question (why do it).
---
I guarantee if they do this, it will somehow make it weigh the full amount
---
Or quite possibly, it was only funny in my head :)
---
low 200s. Will be back for more later.
---
The worst part is it's there twice lol
---
That's right.
---
They also should make weapons scale to player level 1:1.
---
We fight level 65 and above enemies with level 45 and 50 weapons 
---
But I still want to find Todd and publicly burn him at the stake. Anyone able to doxx him yet?
---
Ah
---
From someone who convinced their last 5 gaming friends to take the plunge and has been banned from recommending games for the foreseeable future, I feel your pain.
---
Took me an hour just to get one of them to try the Jump Force Beta and it was free, the first thing they said was "I still haven't forgotten that Fallout bullshit you had me pay $60 for".
---
All 5 of them have made it clear they'll never buy a game on my word again and frankly I don't blame them.
---
Gave me a chuckle, Beth deserves this right now. This team the got working on the game is novice, they need some vets to step on in and take over. 
---
That would be my first question.
---
Second would be did you reboot after the update ? 
---
Third do you clean your temp folders regularly? 
---
Level 20.
---
20.
---
Btw, wich other method you use? How many caps can you make in an hour?
---
I only put 70ish hours into this game. I keep tabs on it, because obviously, I want it to get good. The guessed it would take 6 months for it to get "good" but with the fumbling I've been seeing, I'm starting to even wonder if that is possible. 
---
I originally joined this sub to find out cool secrets and stories from other players about this game but got the exact opposite. Now i skip through all the posts that repeat the same thing over and over and over... or check out the other subs related to fallout
---
The ones that spawn from Scorchbeast fight will teleport around but not flee from the battle.
---
My main is great but will start an alt tonight. My main is good at everything (one handed melee, two handed, rifles, shotgun and pistol). I want to specialise a build into only one thing now.
---
That's a bummer. Jeez. How many other games could you have gotten for $150?
---
Really.... really tired of all the work of launching a nuke, getting to the rifts...   
---
Dealing with the increased difficulty because all the level 5 - 30's come to "tag" her....   
---
Finally kill her only to get 1\* Nocturnal wood armor.. and of course explosive vents... Can't forget them.
---
!
---
Probably not lol but it is what it is, there’s other games that are good out there too
---
We are the majority, a few you tubers did the numbers and there are only like 400k players total still playing this game. The percentage of people that killed the SBQ is so low because most people that bought the game quit long before the end game 
---
In science a theory stands until it’s disproven. You don’t have burden of proof when it comes to a theory, that’s a legal thing. They may care a little but this was obviously a cash grab, in my opinion. They marketed and priced this game as a fully functional stand alone title, and it’s a BETA at best. Should have been a DLC for Fallout 4. And it’s fairly obvious at this point that they’re not going to invest a ton of time and resources into fixing it. They got our money already, there’s no financial incentive for them to dump a ton of money into fixing the game. 
---
Sorry, worded it really badly, I was fighting a scorched queen while writing it. What I meant was if I took two twisted muscles serums, would I get +50 melee instead of +25?
---
..use those posts as a source
---
Found the legs and helmet!
---
I actually dont know
---
So to summarize, they made items protected from “scrap all” unable to be auto-scrapped. This unfortunately included bulk packs so  they fixed the bulk issue by making bulk packs affected by “scrap all”?  That just seems lazy AF, but not unexpected. 
---
Yeah but they also heavily nerfed people who play using grenade builds which wasn't necessarily a strong build to begin with but now it doesn't seem to be viable whatsoever 
---
That is, well a little damning..   
---
It's ironic as this sub was originally mocked by the other Fallout sub's for being too forgiving.
---
Remove mods, try again, if it works, then mod is outdated
---
The hyperbole is reaching epic levels for sure. My non two shot explosive shotty is fine with no shotgun perks...ohnooesss 3 shots to kill a 68 instead of 1! 
---
"I don't care about your opinion"
---
Continues to reply to entire comment.
---
You sir are the perfect example of ignorance.
---
Keep grasping for those straws bruh. Lol.
---
Ill try that. Thanks. 
---
I’m not bitter over. Caps are easy to get if you know where to Farm for them. I’m also not talking about Cap Stashes either.
---
They done already did that!
---
IF this post remains two weeks from now, I will give TOPEKEGO $5 via PayPal. Note: I will be leaving for Belgium on the 12th, and don't often check Reddit. If some time passes after February 14th, 2019 and I have not replied then DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED! I will hold up my end of the deal, unlike the asshats who put out this game. As for TOPOKEGO, please PM me your info so we can link up in 2 weeks for your $5 reward.
---
100%, we are the core group of players still left.
---
Can’t have both 
---
RIP plastic :(
---
TS is still one of the best prefixes. Flat +25% bonus. Most of the other prefixes either give smaller bonuses, or bonuses only under certain conditions (against certain enemy types, when very low health, when enemy is full health, when enemy is almost dead, etc).
---
Explosive is still one of the best major affixes (secondary star effect). 20% bonus damage, with aoe, and let's you double dip damage perks.
---
See if it has an update available or uninstall.
---
It might be causing problems.
---
The last patch (not the hotfix today) forced alot of mods to be updated to not cause crashes
---
OP is a fucking tool. anyone who defends this game at this point must have so much time sunk in they cant let go. seriously this game is hot garbage im surprised anyone is still playing it. how about the fact its basically fucking bundled for free EVERYWHERE because they cant even sell it for $10 lmaoo when people paid $60 two months ago. 
---
&gt;FO76 is in no way behind schedule for content update compared to the previous game. 
---
I'd say that issue is less that they're behind schedule as much as it is that this style of game - multiplayer so no mods, etc. - has no real replay value and nothing to do after 'beating' it the first time, on top of having grind-based mechanics.
---
End of the day, people are able to play through all of the content in like a month or two, but they could at least start over, install mods, or replay the game in a whole new way. They kinda can't do that in 76. Sure, you could replay the game and make a different build... but why do that when you can just swap out cards and stats? The quests, story, and game-interaction in general wasn't really the draw. There's no alternative routes to take quests... because they're all basically just the same with no interaction.
---
The game is mostly just suffering from being an MMO-Lite style of game, and thus the content can't possibly keep up with player consumption.
---
Of course, all of this is before we start talking about the valid criticisms of the game and devs from a design and execution stand point.
---

---
Preach! 
---
 than they have already? 
---
Wat?
---
Apparently on U4GM, they sell like 100 Salisbury steaks for a dollar or two. I just thought it was hilarious.
---
He's old enough to realize this outrage culture is bullshit and he's above it all.
---
 That is fair, but I doubt it will happen.  What mods becomes officially supported will probably be much less than past games and only through Bethesda for obvious concerns.  Maybe private servers will allow more involved modding, but who knows.
---
People who own the game but stopped playing are still invested in it, look at no mans sky. Leaving a game until it's patched a few times is a fairly common practice anymore, especially when there's release issues as bad as 76's. By only catering to active users they're only going to retain users, but to make more mtx income they need more players in general. 
---
Is there a way to know how many hours I've played on the XBox?
---
I saw this Monday night for the first time 
---
It's also not NOT a game so there's that 
---
5 x 0 = 0      
---
Dunno about that. reddit is for english speakers, mostly NA. fo76 subreddit representing NA players? sure. But does  it represent millions of other players out there? I don't think so
---
No
---
It's killing me that (at this time) nearly half the comments are debating the definition and usage of hotfix...
---
Waaaaaaaaa. Now you have to fight.   In a survival game. 
---
No… it happens after patch, not after hotfix.
---
Can’t, used all perk spaces with slugger and strong back. Took as much I can from the other SPECIALs with putting any REAL negative effects on my character
---
I come from ESO when it was in Beta. I've seen worse. And by worse I mean when the game was virtually unplayable for 2 months and hella unbalanced for near 8 months, with numerous bugs. 
---
Now it's one of the best MMOs to date, with constant updates and expansions, and it's wonderful. 
---
Yes, Fo76 isn't an MMO with only 24/server, but it's still not the worst launch I'd seen. I've become pretty complacent, because the more I expect from someone, the angrier I'll be, and I like being chill so if the game freezes or crashes, I hop onto Minecraft and fuck up some zombies until I feel like coming back to Fo76. I know it'll get much better. 
---
The biggest bug I noticed was the Bulk scrap, but I didn't mind. I just said "....ok. I'll just scrap the bulk, plenty of plastic in the game". The prices are great, makes me want to find caps for once and save up for all the new plans I can buy now, hence making me play longer. 
---
Yeah I'm a filthy casual, but in very competitive in other games. I like survival games for the ability to fuck around, have fun, and interact with others. I like having multiple characters to act in different ways. (Wish the in game name was the player name and not your username). 
---
My biggest gripe was the min/max one shot kills people did on the Scorchbeast Queen and other players. It was silly, and it'd be fine if it was single player, but it's not. It's multiplayer, and things have to be balanced, for the benefit of all and loss for very few. Honestly, all I can say is "nerf me harder daddy", bring me some hardcore shit that makes me feel like I'm trying to survive, because the only things that currently scare me are feral Ghoul hordes, Scorchbeasts, and those goddamn teleporting molerats that scare the shit out of me. 
---
Love the update. Don't like some of the old bugs, but I can live. Hell, played with them for months already, doesn't mean a lot to me to play a few more days with them again till they get patched up
---
I’ll be on in a bit I’ll hit u up
---
Witcher 3 was okay. I like more crafting and building and stuff though, and Skyrim scratches my hoarding itch. Fallout does too for the same reason. Probably why I stuck with FO76 as long as I have, I like scrounging and building new camps. Just a nerd like that I guess. Same reason why when I used to play The Sims all I did was build and decorate houses. 
---
Bethesda is clearly not an organization to be taken seriously. Like... at all. They made a few good games, 1 stand-out game (Skyrim) and that’s about it. Their dev team is not a place that has aspiring video game devs fighting tooth and nail to get their resumes in the door somehow lol
---
Nighttime? You mean when you load in and your screen is all black except for your HUD? No that’s a glitch
---
Much appreciated :)
---
I am a super casual gamer, but I completely disagree. 
---
This game is almost unplayable. 
---
Tldr : you guys are so into masochism that this sub should be nsfw

Things like this are what get the imagination and curiosity going. You wonder WTH Skelton catapults are for and start looking for other situational clues... and if you can’t find any obvious implications, you create an explanation for yourself. 
---
You are exactly right. People have gotten spoiled with Explosive weapons and Duping that they forgot how to play the game regularly

I'm going to go by the usage of all the software and AAA developers. Not what your personal circle of peers thinks.

Would've been 1000x better if they just released a FO4 xpac with coop.
---
Serious question, but why do you guys think anything will change when you keep supporting Bethesda?
---
I need not repeat it, but it's common knowledge (ie google search) all the shady practices and overall disgusting behaviour exhibited by Bethesda. I totally get loving Fallout, I sure fucking do but they are robbing you all and getting away with it.
---
You'd get better results from actually talking with your wallet these days. Haven't y'all seen how little speaking facts matters to bigwigs?
---
I ask genuinely as a gamer because I feel you all have been abused the worst yet.

---
I hate uninstalling stuff.  I've bought so many hard drives over the years to expand my various platforms' capacity - just so that I can play a game I feel like playing on a whim instead of having to wait til the next day after I get that whim and the install files/patches have finished downloading. 
---
Stores giving away games with purchases is not the same as free to play.
---
Damn, that would’ve been amazing, guess I should listen to u/CUBUFF92
---
My water purifiers are fine  :(
---
There are not millions of Fo76 players. There’s like 400k left, even less. Millions of people bought the game but all those people are long gone
---
send me the mod modified, thanks

Yea, game stop is the worst. Oh you meant the atom store? Either way, point stands.
---
I like how you started solely with “Detract it is” then moved to acting like I’m a bad guy once you started getting downvoted. If you wanna see how I play or what I prioritize maybe check some of my posts. Maybe take a gleaning into who I am before making assumptions. Enjoy the rest of your post
---
a-are you scared?
---
Actually, the average player said fuck this shit and quit a month after launch. Now Bethesda is going to have a class action lawsuit filed against them in 24 days if they do not allow refunds.
---
Like I've said from day one: I'll get it when the private servers are out and modders have added all my required features that Bethesda clearly thinks are unreasonable.
---
So the way that purifiers work is really weird, each type of purifier generates water at a set rate, getting multiple of one type doesn't increase the speed at which they generate water, it just makes it so that you can hold more waters, so what you want to do it get multiple of each type of purifier and even then it still seems a little buggy and doesn't seem to work like it should

The early vault trophies are bugged. They don't always show. One of mine does,  one doesn't.

1.4k selling straight jackets and more just killing stuff 
---
Heh.  Or you pay a monthly subscription to rent them. ;)
---
please re-read my comment, with the sarcasm/snark set to about 7.5, it should make more sense that way.  I was saying they don't use the tools they have to check their 'patches' actually do what they're supposed to. 
---
I’m just here for the entertainment and dumpster fire. At least the devs are making something of this shitshow lol
---
Lol this was good
---
Update your mods/remove the known plans .dll file
---
No, I mean when the sun isn't out. The screen isn't black, it's just much darker than it was yesterday. And only at night. The daytime looks fine still.
---
for a controller purchase???? I don't think any of my stores have that kind of deal
---
well, if that is your logic, how many of 171k still play this game? 30k? 20? maybe even less?
---
17% of Skyrim players didn't finish Helgen.  Shit. That's depressing. 
---
How many own and never loaded it? 
---
You don't get the mods. You learn to make mods.
---
Yeah I know I was just joking, there was a new bug that blacks out the screen
---
Not far from cap stash farming with rank 3 cap collector.

Path of Exile (PC version)
---
Then all the items will be lost forever and the dupeing problem will be solved! :P
---
*Laughs in Mariners*
---
Are your thoughts always in poem form?
---
Atom challenges are all wonky.  Too many of them are broken to list. 
---
Better yet, get some popcorn, Bethesda has 24 days remaining before the class action lawsuit starts if they don't provide people the right to a refund.
---
Bethesda should separate PvP and adventure mode. But they shouldn't balance anything. What they should do is increase your hit points, by a specific number that is determined by ones endurance, every level. Then there would be no one shot kills for those who do PvP in similar levels. It's not unexpected for a level 10 to be one shot by a level 100. That's how it should be. So you split the game into adventure mode, with no PvP, and survival mode with unrestricted PvP. You can still use the wanted system. If a player that is more than twice the level of another player initiates combat then they become wanted. If the lower level, by at least 20 levels, initiates combat then no one is wanted. They could tier the weapons into higher level restrictions. 1 stars can be equipped by anyone, 2 stars those about level 40, 3 stars by those about level 80, 4 stars by those about level 120. Look at the weapons and armor, nothing tiered for players above level 50. This would increase end game rewards. They could also do quests in instanced zones with enemies based on the level of the person who initiated the quest. The weight restriction is a great plan to reduce duping. They also need perks that allows vendors to have more caps looked the hacker or lockpick cards. They could stage them at levels. This would help restrict expensive items to appropriate level players. This, I think, would fix the game. It would make it soloable for those who wish, it would also help with spawns and quests for groups.
---
Lemme guess..
---
You saw it on the internet so it must be true....
---
Lovely. I haven't experienced that one yet...
---
uninstalled... 
---
i have no tse, but... in any mmorpg the trash mobs 1shot.
---
Never said they didn't need to be scaled down but the whiners accelerated the process. Instead of say, doing a balance patch and finding a happy medium with the gun, they brought it down to dogshit levels. I might as well use a pipe rifle... ammo in more common ...it still takes 3 clips to down a single ghoul. An end game weapon SHOULD be effective.
---
Let me log on my PS4 and look at it. Gimme a few.
---
I would just cry when I start reminiscing about the good ol' days of KotOR.
---
That’s where it’s coming from eh?
---
That’s true but we are still not a teeny tiny portion of the player base, we are the most active and passionate. Say only half of 171k still play, that’s 85k and almost 1/4th of the entire playerbase 
---
Someone lost their junk...
---
Same here. I think my fusion cores are draining faster, too. Increased tick rate, maybe?
---
yeah you like this game? where every weapon is busted and melee is the only thing people use anymore because of it? you feel good for not duping when they cant even fix it after two months? cool
---
So what you're saying is you've played for hundreds of hours and aren't affected by the changes which is exactly what I said?
---
Agree with OP all you want, doesn't change the fact you're agreeing with abunch of made up nonsense. There's literally NO evidence suggesting the only people upset are TSE super-grinders with thousands of hours, but a post right on the front page with hundreds of people talking about how everyone they convinced to play the game with them stopped after a week/month of casual play. Dozens of reviews stating "this game was nigh impossible to play for a long term" BEFORE the patches and much more.
---
Like I said in another post, if you like the game that's great, I'm glad you enjoy your purchase, but making up stories about the people who don't to try and discredit them because it makes you feel better or something is pure asshattery.
---
That has been there since day 1 for me on PS4 and has never gone away.
---
It definitely is. I play a sneak strength character and things keep coming back to life like crazy!!! 
---
And search this sub for your question.
---
Not interested in you or your critique. I attempted to promote a little awareness in you attempted to stifle it.
---
Still have to buff base gun damage. Enemies over level 50 are super bullet sponges. Unless you run sneak Sniper build or bloodied gun build. Melee can One Shot those Enemies.
---
Over all I agree with you. I think if they did that they would see only about 20-25% would play PVP. That might be a high estimation honestly.
---
btw this 20$ price show two things:
---
1. they think we r idots
---
2. they don't know how this busines work.
---
they lost ther reputation in the gamer community for ever.
---
Exactly! It was such a fun balance of serious and goofy. It was my first Far Cry game and my boyfriend got me to try it out. It made me want to go back and play the other ones.
---
This was happening to me until I removed my mods
---
I can’t understand why they would nerf it 75% I’m amazed how stupid u can be I can see them nerfing the bobble heads but the perk cards I’m amazed how stupid these devs r. 
---
The government is not representative. 
---
I had a few in the 100+ hours but nothing to lose my mind about.
---
Maybe I am just used to bugs. I remember losing progress on my PS3 games regularly due to games just freezing randomly so a glitch every now and again in FO76 does not affect me.
---
Hell, I'd settle for a purely cosmetic one; I've got an ice machine in my kitchen currently, acting as a stand-in.
---
I wanted this too, but the military fatigues under combat armor looks like shit because the combat armor model "puffs up" and makes your character look rather silly.
---
I was very disappointed.
---
Afaik, the timer is server sided, your game never knows when it starts or stops.
---
Any idea where to get them post patch? I've been trying to find them and can't seem to find a location anywhere.
---
lol yeah I realize that. The entire thing is stupid that they made it that way in the first place is more the issue....
---
Just hit level 50, always looking for people to play with, send me your ign and I’ll add. 
---
lmao when you cant even uninstall. It Just Works!
---
Had my first invisible ghoul tonight.  Obnoxious.  No red crosshair either.
---
Yea, I think thats what I used to use to find my specs. I've had this PC for a few years now so i'm not new to it, I just haven't gotten around to memorising all the oddly named parts in it. And yea, windows 10.
---
Yeah that’s a big, when you join, DO NOT go into your pip boy right away until everything loads into the world or your game will freeze completely. Wait a bit
---
Yeah, I get how they work. What I'm saying is that six purifiers that generate 60/hour should each be putting out 1/minute. Each holds a max of five, so if I go away for half an hour they should all be full when I get back, for a total of 30 water. When I come back 3 or 4 are empty (I lock them) and the rest have 1 or 2 each in them. 
---
If I stick around camp (and am therefore sure that it's not being taken by another player), the same thing happens. They're not producing at the rate they're supposed to - most of them are not producing at all.
---
Fc2 is free on Xbox but oh it’s god awful 
---
I would do this. Except a lot of time I spawn around enemies and get murdered. 
---
That'd be so awesome and add a ton of replayability with little added work, comparatively. 
---
No one wants to hear from a reasonable man who enjoys the game. 
---
Except me. And OP. And lots of others. 
---
its worse than fanboying. im not even sure there is a name for how far they have fallen down the Todd hole
---
I had a 3 star drop nothing legendary as well. Just normal look for that type of enemy. Really annoying. 
---
Take that, you Zetan bastard! 
---
But did Bethesda actually officially say that Fallout 76 wouldn't be going free to play?
---
Well I don't know about that.
---
"Hot" usually means it's done whilst the system is running, like "hot swapping" computer components - like you can do with USB devices. PS/2 mice used to crash the system if you unplugged them.
---
[Also this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTHNpusq654)
---
Maybe put it in the cash register at the station. Less chance of losing it then.
---
Whoa chill bro. Subs to this subreddit has been constantly increasing ever since launch, even with playerbase of fo76 dwindling as you say. 171k is super inflated. I'd say about 10\~20% of 171k is still active. With 20% being extremley generous
---
Fuck this game. Not buying it. Ever.
---
They also made unique weapons *unique* not slap a fancy name on and a legendary affect no they would make a brand new texture model, slap a fancy name on, and make the legendary affect it got unique
---
I'll take caps or plans.  Can't find Basketball Hoop 2 for the life of me.
---
And a 0.1lb bobby-pin 👍🏻
---
Time to buy that shotgun.
---
That’s assuming you even get to kill her, because your game crashes. Or when you do kill her. The loot isn’t there, because it’s loading infinite.
---
These hotfixes, they just work!
---
This has more to do with with GameStop going out of business then anything with FO76 
---
I enjoyed the game for about 100 hours and I preordered PA Ed because I knew (thought I knew) that my most beloved video game company would be releasing another game from my most beloved franchise. Upon playing, chatting to others in game, persevering with a barrage of bugs/basic missing features and watching the Atom shop fill with oddly familiar items and defending Beth. I finally realised that I had been completely mislead and blatantly ripped off. 
---
It seems as though people aren’t “butt hurt”, or “shouldn’t be playing if they don’t like it” but are actually expressing their sheer disappointment and frustration with this huge corporation who insulted its loyal customers with a shameless money grab. 
---
I twice payed Bethesda for the time they spent making fo4 (Xbox, PC). Then I payed them for fo76 and forgave/ignored that 76 is a literal copy paste of fo4. NOW I’m being asked, yet again, to pay for items that I have already payed for 3 years prior, through their Atom shop?!  I don’t care how much you love this game. Would you ever let any other company selling ANYTHING do this to you? No. Because it’s a fucking rip off. 
---
This isn’t a matter people getting upset because they don’t like a game. This is a case of shitloads of people getting pissed with a big time company who mislead them into purchasing a product that was falsely advertised and was not at an acceptable standard when it was released.  I don’t care if it’s a game, a car or a fucking microwave. ANY. ANY COMPANY that’s treats a customer (that’s also you btw) in this way deserves to pay compensation and/or amend the issues with their product. 
---
Are they trying to fix things? Somewhat, but it’s half arsed at best and they still manage to find plenty of time to replenish the Atom shop. Hell, the Atom shop seems to be the only thing in game that was polished and ready for release at launch. 
---
I stopped playing just over 3 weeks ago because I can’t take the frustration of gameplay any longer. I have no probs with anyone who is still enjoying it, I’m glad it brings them joy. What I’m saying is as a consumer of a product, I won’t sit here and defend a company that tried to pull the wool over my eyes and screw me over and neither should you. 
---
I am chill lol, you chill. I’m really not angry I just think OP is way underselling the percentage we represent 
---
lmao. I've been full time streaming it since the beta so it's really not.
---
I just quite two or so weeks ago, about a week before the ban.
---
Just have the actual item name underneath in the details screen. Like a subtitle.
---
Also, let us see the details screen in trades.
---
The level of the guns could continue to increase infinitely just like player levels, and every five levels the gun gets stronger. They are worried about balancing combat between lore level players and high level players but they shouldn't. High level players should be able to simply kill low levels. I said no PvP on adventure but agreed on PvP would be fine. You could do no damage to other players unless challenged to a duel and the other player accepted. Then a timer appears and initiates combat. On the PvP server they could make it so that if you were more than 20 levels different and the higher level initiated combat then dieing would have no negative for the lower level and no rewards for the higher level. But the higher would become wanted and then appear on the map to everyone else, but otherwise you can't see anyone in the map unless you are grouped.

Do you use mods? Have you updated Perk Loadout Manager, Better Inventory, and uninstalled Known Plans and Save My Stuff?  
---
After Tuesday's Patch, Perk Loadout Manager was causing the crash on load for me. Better Inventory and Save My Stuff were keeping me from buying or selling to vendors. Known Plans is now included by Bethesda, and Save My Stuff hasn't been updated.
---
The 'explosive' effect was by no means nerfed too hard. In fact, it's _still_ more potent than most other legendary effects.
---
Another major effect increases ranged damage by 10% while aiming. Another increases RoF by 25%. +25% as an AoE is in-line with the other effects. +100% was absolutely unbalanced.
---
Funny. Have an up
---
I'm sorry I can only give this asinine BS only one downvote. 
---
Kill your self
---
i'm good , i'm not the one asking about it they should look those up themselves 
---
I played fallout4 at launch. I've stopped playing 76. thats a big difference for me
---
That started happening to me in the the patch before the hotfix. What I found is their corpses were moving back to where the enemy originally spawned (so if you don't know where they spawned, just look around).
---
Can't guarantee this will work every time though, bc I've only seen this issue a few times so far.
---
That's not a hotfix. Some games can make on the fly changes to the code live, yeah, but that's just a bonus. A hotfix is just a quickly made fix rolled out ASAP
---
We’ll send you Trump!! 
---
I love you dude. You are a god damn super hero of fo76. I've been fighting in these sidelines saying the same shit and getting so much hate, but to see this post succeed gives me such hope.
---
Keep up the fight! Check my comment history, we will get some damn positivity to this sub!
---
Emergency patch! What was the update?
---
This subreddit is very vocal and loud. I give it that. But being loud doesn't mean that it represents something
---
Thank you folks - that'll just be a mere 800 atoms for the Cold Fusion 2076 refrigerator...
---
I just hopped the Watoga vendor bot for 20min and got the whole heavy combat plan set
---
I'm one of the filthy casuals. I'm just now reaching level 30. Never killed a scortch beast. Never fired an explosive anything. Most of the changes don't affect me in anyway, at least not in a way I understand.  I've had the game since launch and play it a couple hours every couple of nights. I'm enjoying myself. I'm sorry if you aren't but I see it in every game community. Ark, crossout, fortnite (pve), borderlands, gtav, even Terraria and Don't starve.I know there are hardcore people, but again the vast majority of any game don't visit the official forums let alone a subreddit. That's not to say your complaints aren't valid to your experience, but understand that isn't everyone's experience. And, if anyone played ark you'd really know the pain of a Dev not listening to their player group, try hards and casuals are both screwed by Wildcard constantly. My main gripe with fo76 is how they butchered the lore, but after getting over that I'm enjoying a flawed, but fun game.
---
i can confirm, luckily i only had a few bulked items but they were all gone.  bulked one more to confirm and yes bug is real.  this sucks
---
Yeah he just called me yesterday, he said everything is copacetic.😉

It seems like this issue comes and goes for me. As well. Have you tried logging out and back in?

Someone did point out of you run around you need water more frequently, are you maybe doing a ton of running.

---
I need to find some people who want to trade kills and revives for my last two achievements 
---
This is exactly what I’ve been saying the whole time. The ones complaining are the ones who rushed the game.
---
People are beating the game before the first update or patch comes out then complaining how bad the game is.
---
I understand it should be presentable on release but then again, every game has bugs at release

Much appreciated.

I don't really know the distinction between AAA and lower studios, but none of those other companies looked like a AAA company like Bethesda

yeah as an individual copy but not with bundles with a freakin controller ffs this game is sht

Yep, I noticed that, too.

Please no.

I like being able to avoid a nuke zone, and tripling the area would make life for low level players hell. 
---
We aren't all level 190 with end game shit

That’s exactly what it means. That’s why they are here communicating with us directly through community managers. That’s why there have been several fixes that this subreddit specifically requested like Bobby pins. This subreddit is literary the most influential community for fallout 76...
---
What platform are you on? Tested mine in Xbox and it’s working fine.
---
Oh wow. I didn't realize it had infected this sub too. I wonder how long it's been going on. It won't help the perception of this sub.
---
What an absolute bummer it is so diminished from Fallout 4.
---
Wow!!!! Fallout 76 is my favorite game!! Don't hate on it like that, that's MEAN! ;(
---
For 60$ you are ok being beta testing? Fucking christ

Thanks everyone for the responses. Much appreciated!👍

                        I’m going a camp upgrade so this helps!

But you still play right?

That’s why you’re here supporting your duper buddy..

Cuz if you can swing public opinion then things may go easier on you.

I mean you may have stopped duping but your sitting on duped products  hoping the attention shifts and you can sell on ebay or CL..

Your feigned indignation and overly dramatic outrage lack...

Authenticity!

You talk smack about how the program sucks but..it doesn’t stop you from playing.

Gotta keep those YouTube cameras rolling..no ad money means a real job! 
---
You can aggregate this whole post into 2 statements
---
1) tell me who your friends are...
---
2) thick as thieves...
---
If it helps, IF Bethesda really is on a witch hunt for dupers. You can argue and debate and yell
---
About the injustice. But, if you’re as tight w/your friend as you claim, you’re dirty too..
---
It’s not a matter of why,  only a question of when..
---
You have the concept of a theory entirely backwards.  A theory is only as strong as the evidence behind it. If I say I have a theory unicorns exist everyone will think I'm a moron, but if I start showing piles of rainbow goo, horns who's dust heals wounds, etc. suddenly I know have sufficient evidence for it to be considered.  The burden of proof is *always* on the theory, that's why we have so many studies to attempt to verify theories.  Don't spread misinformation about science; there is already enough.
---
PC, XBOX, or PS4?
---
It's easier now. 
---
Oh shit man, it’s a meme over on r/2007scape, thought you played still
---
Who carries bulk scrap, anyway? 
---
Talked to Todd about the patch 2 days ago, he said “ it just works” maybe that’s why everything is so backwards 
---
Yeah, OP has to do a chargeback for each individual game he can no longer play. How fucking shitty of this worthless company.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
He said there were other posts about it, maybe run the search yourself?
---
Better yet, if they're leaving can we get a bot to change any future posts to "I quit xx days ago, but I still seem to want to be active in the community and bitch about how mad I am."
---
This is the definition form Google.
---
I was thinking today, what if the SBQ was really challenging... with mechanics that would make you have to hit her wings to make it land... after some time in the ground and that scream attack, lots of scorched would spawn and run to the SBQ direction. The more scorched reach her, more her health would regenerate, to the point she recovers her ability to fly... maybe another round of that, or some other mechanic involving some legendary creatures (to help with the event loot)...
---
Then I realized they took 24 hours of development and testing to release a change on the bobby pin weight.

I didnt waste my money if I spent 270 hours playing the game. obviously that money was well spent. But ok. 
---
Can't believe how true this is, I've played for 2 months and I'm level 23 and I'm pretty much unaffected by any nerfs or changes. I enjoy building my camp and taking my time playing the game.
---
Who cares what those assholes have say?
---
Well then you arent going by any developers information then considering very few if any developers actually talk to the public. I took 3 years if software development courses in college. By no means am i an expert, but i know the termobology and gave you the correct definitions, you can feel free to look them up and research (which doesnt include pulling definitions from wikipedia btw) them yourself.

The OP didn't request negative feedback be deleted.

Considering the big deal for PC was the upgrade to 64-bit opening up the possibility of far more PC modding, I doubt that a significant portion would've stayed on the far inferior 1 GB of RAM.

By the same context I got banned just by having them on my account-- without even playing the game for a week. So... you might get banned anyway?

Amazing work!

I find more and more people being impatient... I no sooner get to vendor to start selling my wears before someone starts hopping around like I have to let them go...to those people, know this...I take longer. Try server hopping like I do if I'm patiently waiting for you to sell your things.

Side note, it would be nice to communicate "1 min" while in the vendor screen, so that people know I'm not afk.

experiencing a "mass" on the right side of my screen when in sneak and have a weapon drawn. It goes away if I aim down sight. Also if in sneak and unarmed it moves to the center and is shaped like a triangle. Also teammates will become invisible and stay that way until restarting the game.
---
Wait I thought they fixed that 
---
Agreed. They did fix the bobblehead stacking though.  Melee still needs to be toned down.
---
Update got me. This will take a little time. Sorry.
---
No.  Scrap all used ti leave bulk intact.
---
&gt;Personally, I need the hard drive space for the next game.
---
What did Bethesda think they had to gain trying to court this audience of locusts over its core fanbase? The mind boggles.

I was wondering how long it would take before I saw one of your videos pop up for Fallout 76. Nice tutorial per the usual. Cheers.

I live in the middle of corn and soybean country, so I understand rural. There really isn't squat to do when it is -23F outside, or a high of -2F that we had today. So daya like the last 2 or 3, I just go with the flow. I live about an hour south of Chicago, and I think we were colder than Chicago. 
---
No this is why we need to stop preordering games. And stop buying games on launch. Just buy the game after its been out a year is what we have to do. Im getting sick and tired of the back and forth and im just gonna take a break. 
---
In game surveys might do something but the deva just need time to fix everything.

They need to get an engine developed for multi player, a huge limitation I have been told, so second hand info, is that it can only handle a limited amount of NPC's making it hard to do multiplayer. This is probably why the servers are limited to 24, unlike most that can do well over that player count. I tested this NPC limit sort of in FO4 by spawning in a ton of em and yes it crashed but could have just been that game, haven't tried it multiple times to do a real test.
---
Is there solid evidence that people have moved from the fallout subreddit to this one?
---
If you look at the post history of some of the quitting posts, they were defending the game in this subreddit a week ago.

waited this long to get a refund THIS GAMER IS RISING UUUUP
---
This is a "hot" button issue for you I see.
---
You better hope the last items you aren't getting are a million (nylon) bags
---
Oh *man* you came through. I was a bit skeptical I won't lie. Welp, I guess this sub's served its purpose and is done. Thanks.
---
No worries. It's past my bedtime, so I'll hear about it tomorrow :)
---
Same it comes and goes

https://youtu.be/vSPEOm4Bnvw at 9:00 he talks about. After that, we went and tried shooting it with the Vox Syringer and a regular Syringer while using buffout on it. You are correct though, he did not mention that we tried that in the video. I think someone in the comments suggested we try it, so we went ahead and did that and got no results. Probably should’ve had a follow-up video or at least a comment to bust the myth. 
---
Everyone until about 10 years ago. The guy that made the format called it Jiff. That's what it always was, but as more and more people encountered the word without having knowledge of the pronunciation, they started calling it Giff. 
---
I thought this was pretty obvious. I was able to double the durability of my shotgun by changing the mods around
---
I was going to add a list of games like that and thought that would just garner a ton of troll comments.
---
Works for every game. You won't have to buy two of anything. This works for DLC too. 
---
Amen brotha - played in beta and still only level 49. Only so much time to play.
---
As a modder, I'd prefer us to focus our efforts on something that isn't a capsizing, on-fire trash barge
---
This is not what free to play means and Bethesda themselves said it’s not happening. Stop spreading fake news
---
Why would they listen to us if we don’t represent the playerbase? What do we represent then? The playerbase for call of duty? This subreddit is the largest representation of the playerbase they have. 
---
to put it mildly, you sir are a master of understatement. :)
---
Ah, well it's an inside joke with my family.  I use to say jiff in like..2006? And my family had never heard of that before. But i said gif like 5 years ago and everyone understood.  I honestly thought it was a joke about the jiff pronunciation. Thanks for that tidbit!
---
You mean you send it to your CC company when Bethesda challenges your chargeback, right?
---
I've spent over 300 hours in this game and I still play. What else can you get that much use out of for $60? I'd probably be a lot less ok with it if it was buggy AND it wasn't fun. As it is, I've more than got my money's worth. What should I do? Me miserable and try to make everyone else miserable? I think this sub has that covered. I'll just keep basing my enjoyment of the game on my own experiences. 
---
This is what you signed up for

That's not entitlement by definition. You seem confused. I see your point but be consistant in your writing and use of the english language to make the point you are trying to make. I feel a lot of your upvotes are just people siding with you because they don't agree with him.
---
He is correct gamers feel entitled to a certain level of product and their reaction is unjust. Not completely but this is by comparison on the same scale of , you go to the restraunt for dinner and they get 3 out of 5 meals wrong.  They apologize and bring the correct meals but now the other 2 who waiteds food is cold and want a fresh dish and complain about it. They heat up the food and now there is a hair in it. It could be the customers hair but regardless they want the food replaced. In the end everyone has their meal but they are upset the desert they ordered isn't ready even though their food just arrived. Some people start screaming and throwing their food on the floor while demanding to still be served but they aren't even at that table, their food was fine, but their evening ruined by others misfortune demanding free deserts for everyone and now.
---
I feel thats as close you can get analogy wise.
---
Yeah it's probably been more than 10 years. I'm older than I like to think sometimes. But that's a great point. It's changed so much that Jiff has lost all meaning. I like Jiff better, but what are you going to do? 
---
Their in Thailand spending our money.

Obey the reddit game designer council or get out of our way, RISE UP BRUTHERS

How did you get benches into the tent?  I thought it was pretty much impossible to do!  The only thing it will allow me to place is sleeping bags.
---
lmao
---
Had the same issue with my gauss rifle.
---
This for sure.  Been running through fusion cores extremely fast lately.
---
The only time I caused crashes ruining other peoples experiences is when I launched nukes and nukes crash the server... but wait... that ruins my experience too. Got plenty of stream footage of that.
---
I know, but i thought they removed that. 
---
ive done soundtracks off spotify too! bladerunner is a no brainer. dark synthwave, retro wave and outrun are great playlist searches too if you want more of the 80s b movie theme i find fits real well with this game.
---
I try 😄
---
*too
---
Dammit, that sucks. Sorry dude.

Thanks for checking!
---
Just look up "10 game breaking bugs that ruin your save".
---
GTA San Andreas, Luigi's mansion and other classics, the list is quite significant
---
Back in the dayYou could potentially f**K your game beyond all repair and basically lose (potentially) dozens of hours of progress.
---
I think having the ability and technology to fix everyone's copy of a game after launch is a godsend. I also think that same ability has led to a market where developers are pushed by publisher's to just release as many games as possible.
---
"Don't worry, you can just fix it later. People will still buy it".
---
It's just a cruddy system that needs to change
---
I'm almost afraid to ask - is Hardened Scrap getting auto scrapped again too?
---
I don't do Credit cards.... So I would have to see what my Banks policy is on that, but until then I have joined the class action lawsuit against Bethesda namely fallout 76.
---
I am level 320 and have stopped playing at all for the time being.  More than gotten my money's worth, but this recent patch is just too much for me to enjoy the game anymore.  Explosives were nerfed way too hard for something that had counterplay if you had the dedication to farm/trade up a proper set with the right perks.  Melee PVP is boring and buggy and PVP is the only piece of end game I had left to entertain me.  This combined with all the bugs lowering the overall quality of life leave me not wanting to log in.  
---
I have no idea why they are listening to us. By the looks of toxicity and negativity of this subreddit, that could end very soon. This place is turning into a trainwreck
---
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alaer0/to_the_loweffort_im_leaving_posts_k/

Now that would be fun!!!  
---
Yep!
---
haven't experienced that but have nearly 3 hours of bugs in video after editing. The weekly challenges aren't working, my ranged weapons seem to be regenerating mobs, I never get a fist shot to hit even right in front of the mob using a Tesla and the list is growing.
---
You forget that only maybe 10% of this sub pop is actively involved and only 30-70% of them post or comment.
---
Just keep all your bulk in your Stash until you wanna sell it
---
Mele is where it's at and always has been. IMO
---
No worries, I saw the posts vanishing in real time and still couldn’t believe it until I saw that get posted.
---
Hopefully one day months from now it’ll be a different story and all of this will be a hard to believe tale we tell to the new players.
---
&gt; I think you have a narrow definition of bad business practice.
---
Right I think they are unfair, malicious, or unethical practices rather than whatever I feel upset about from time to time.
---
&gt; if a game does nothing to improve upon what it has already created and still charges full price, that is bad business practice.
---
Define improve in this context.  Also, does this mean console ports are flawed?  It'd be pretty easy to argue that a remaster is just a port to a new console with bonus features.  Ports don't even need new content, so in that light a remaster is better than neutral.
---
&gt; A game that tosses in MTX into a remaster is bad business practice. 
---
The remaster isn't the problem in this situation, the microtransactions are.
---
Tongue in cheek comment 🤪
---
I keep it updated. Don't need the room yet.
---
Nerfing weapons makes everything more of a bullet sponge. I guess they think we wanted that.

Multiple people in this thread have pulled modern definitions out and everyone on this thread can look to games they own and see developers from studios of all different sizes using the same definition of a hotifx.

Feel free to cling to your horrendous idea that anyone cares what the people you know personally think. The world doesn't agree with them or you.
---
Its exploitable - a griefer can target one or two expensive items in a camp like a fusion generator/rad shower, not destroy everything, and walk away with a very small bounty.  Just say no.
---
Ultracite plans should be made sellable. People are dumping them at watoga station. You don't need to kill SBQ to get a full set.
---
Thanks for that info, definitely gotta check em out now!
---
You seem to be misunderstanding who was being the asshole in this scenario...
---
Either that or you just saw the opportunity to rant, which is understandable.
---
ima shoot ya
---
I have no doubt about that, but I learned by picking up less you can do more.
---
I haven’t even begun to play...is it that bad?
---
I log in every now and then but I don’t have the time to grind my stats too often 
---
Three weeks worth of BETA was short and deceptive?  If you bought this game after they warned you that not all the bugs would be fixed and the general status of the game was shown and you still bought it thinking that everything was going to be fixed day 1, you’re a damned fool.   
---
Micro transactions have little to no impact on the actual gameplay, are cosmetic, and while agreeably are more expensive than I’d prefer no one is required to purchase them all let alone a single one.
---
Did you know that Fallout: New Vegas reused a lot of the assets from Fallout 3?  Did you also know that it was released only two years after the release of Fallout 3?  There were three years between Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.  Your argument is shaky at best.
---
Well since its now almost three months past release yeah, definitely impossible, especially if you were denied on the literal launch day.
---
On PC and exactly the same problem, full stealth build lvl 128 and being seen through buildings and even hit through walls after today's "hotfix". I even had the danger up as I climbed into bed at my camp with nothing but frogs in sight.
---
That's why my main can run unarmed, shotguns, or heavies. Will be tough for them to ruin all three at the same time.
---
I’m actually pretty mad at myself for not thinking of doing this sooner. I’ve been running around for the last hour or so with your playlist playing in the app on my ps4, and it’s been awesome! With all the shit that’s been going on with the game the past couple of days, coupled with my interest overall starting to wane for the game, this has honestly kind of invigorated me with the game. Like I’ve just been sitting here with a big dumb grin on my face haha, sometimes it’s just the little things. Thank you my friend!
---
There are radio towers all over. There is one just north of the big digger, just south of Charleston junk yard, and another in the south of savage divide west of the cliffs to the cranberry bog. From my experience higher level loot dropped from requests sent in higher level regions. 
---
Did they release the game a year early or why are there so many bugs?
---
I uninstalled the same day. Not played since I was denied.
---
Robobrains are not supposed to drop fusion cores anyway. 
---
Thanks make me incredibly happy to hear friend lol. Glad to help create another spark for ya 😁
---
If you're asking what I'm wearing? The Wildman outfit. My armor is of various Weightless pieces, mostly for +Sneak, +AP Regen, +Agi/Str and +Defense of course. I did want a full "3 Star Weightless Trapper set with +Rad Resist Affix" to make a pseudo Rad Suit with actual stats and doesn't break in 2 hits but after immense search effort and a vast many WTB request in discord/reddit/in-game I've uncovered 0 and just got whatever Weightless 3 Stars I could find. Equipment RNG makes finding a specific full set literally impossible. So Bethesda telling me to take off my equipment more rare than anything in this world to enter Radiation zones is pretty annoying. 
---
Melee is overrated, let's start doing armor piercing rifle mains
---
Ugh. First line of this is total Propaganda Style BS. Why do I even play this game. I spend more time fighting the bugs than actually playing it.
---
Thank you! It'll be you and me, but it'll catch on! 
---
That's not an excuse that will warrant a refund. 
---
I agree
---
Melee mains are overrated, let's do armor piercing rifle mains
---
LFG is good for that, too
---
I also joke.
---
i hate that feature, when it 1st came out people on friends list didn't know it sends a message to all friends. they were pretty much spamming me every 20 min and popping it on my tv. until i messaged them all and told them if they continue to spam it i'll unfriend. 
---
I'm not even that optimistic.  The way it's worded, it looks to me like only heavy weapons effected by the Demolitions Expert nerf are looking to be buffed.  I'd be profoundly estatic to be wrong.
---
Yeah the sentry bots are the guys that drop the fusion core, not the robobrains.
---
It doesn’t really matter because most is not constructive. I much preferred the folks giving useful information than the ones who are finally at 400 hours and throwing a fit because there is not enough content.
---
Ah yes, I forgot about the great resource that is webcache snapshots. Thanks mostlylurker!
---
It's like the Monkey's Paw.
---
...do you think?
---
Maybe.... no....
---
There's  no way. 
---
Maybe...
---
Maybe he has run away!
---
I'd be happy if they allowed us to combine partially charged cores.
---
If  you think that  nerfing a  Gatling gun  to where it   STILL DOES twice  the damage that my Gatling gun does is ruining the game... I am truly at a loss for words.
---
Yeah you can I have both and you can eat anything that isn’t canned basically 
---
It will pass like hiv! From one person to the next loose person!
---
Take a power plant workshop. They can produce eight 100/100 fusion cores an hour.
---
All that dicking around when all you needed to do was repair Poseidon. 
---
Then you’ve discovered a new bug. You can’t have both.
---
So what is? From the message it seems the act of installing invalidates any chance of a refund. Even though we know they can see when it's been uninstalled and is no longer playable.
---
I haven't played tonight due to being at work. But I'll try tomorrow I'm a stealth build too for xb1
---
Todd is currently in Vault 69, with Codsworth and  told me that this game “just works”.
---
I can see nothing gets past you Banana.
---
Same, mine is near the houses just touching the pond and I've never had an issue with him being missing.
---
You use it for the power counter, switches, etc etc
---
Yeah, you pretty much have no choice. We are cold here, but no snow. I just get enough home time, I need more social time. Which is funny because when I live in the city I need more me time. Haha
---
Yeah, the notifications can get excessive, and it needs a way to let you block them from games and people of your choosing. Worst case scenario, you can turn off notifications if you're watching a movie or something.
---
Control things in your camp
---
 I do not think it means what you think it means. 
---
the problem is that may still oversample the "try hard" population unless very carefully controlled.
---
No problem 
---
Why should they listen to a community where posts about quitting the game or banned dupers karma farming get thousands of upvotes? OP mentioned about this community not being normal and he's completely right. I've never seen anything like this. Not gonna say fo76 is of a normal quality of a game, but that don't mean we have to act like raiders
---
I think the game was worth every penny. But after launching my first nuke and killing brood mother twice.(Which was so epic for spoilers i don't want to give.) I have nothing left to do but grind ghouls for crappy loot and spend countless days/hours refilling ammo and armor to go after the same few mobs over and over. Have they even nerfed/fixed broodmother? Ive explored the enite map in the time it took me to get to lvl 56. I got to 120 in a few days of ghoul fighting before they nerfed exp/when i quit .  
---
 Ive never liked power armor and at best i liked vegas's ranger medium.  Forcing me in the power suit i understand for this game. But making me farm as much as they do for repairing armor i didn't want to wear sucks  any joy out of it.  On the other hand White knight nerf hurts only because camp myclintock can only be cleared every so often and fort defiance is a chore. Other places that give little ballistic fiber are barely worth the trek. So if they would make the farming a more reasonable i wouldn't care much. It's just that finding the material at the rate a non power armor player needs repairs sucks doo doo butt.
---
MY buddy list has about 20 people give or take  and only one name lights up when i log in to check the atom store every few days. Before i quit it was 3....17 people i befriended/knew quit in the first month. . Ill tell you every last one of them complained about the armor repairs/ammo and how much of chore it was. Another huge complaint was  the card system. Its amazingly fun until you realize your gonna be swapping those cards over and over again.  EVERY SINGLE TIME you go back to your base is its own chore. Need to swap it for building,gun making/repair,armor making/repair this that the other thing. Just to kill broodmother id have to swap a bunch since all my defense/radiation cards were useless in power armor. 
---
I agree  the majority isn't here bitching. But from my buddy list statistic 90% quit entirely 5% is somehow playing and the other 5% is me praying they stop acting like a cat with a plastic bag stuck on their leg.
---
Yes but from what I understand it’s because the latest patch was more of a rollback version which this was an issue earlier.
---
Friends list?! I have literally never been able to place or receive a friend request. They don’t get out or in. Hilarious bug for a co-op game. 
---
welcome! also groove music is an xbox app that will stream from your microsoft onedrive. Anything you dump in there it will play, i will rip some of my fav djs off of mixcloud, drop them in one drive and stream in background at 5% vol. If you have never used mixcloud and can be tricky at firstto find great content, but what you can find is usually rare, curated, 2hr plus mixes with no commercials.
---
Duuuude i was just wondering this!! I had radworms and i was hoping around suuuppah high. Probably gonna get 'hotfixed' so enjoy it while it lasts.
---
Thay would be pretty awesome. Better yet, the DMV database. 
---
Doesn't help refund though. I bought full price on day 1. Uninstalled on day 1. Still denied.

Why am I a skill 4 pick lock now?
---
No. If you are high level you can like destroy anybody below you then.
---
unfortuniatly shutting off notifications, shuts them off acrost everything, even party invites and game invites. i messaged xbox to have a way to only shut off that notification and not all. they just replied and said what you said lol. not helpful.
---
And believe me, if we are ones representing fallout fanbase, then there is no hope for this franchise
---
While I agree that the rage over the TSE nerf is ridiculous, I do think guns could use a buff across the board.
---
You know what I really hate? Picnic tables. 
---
For once in my life I would like to farm plastic WITHOUT SITTING 
---
Maybe someone passed by?
---
Wouldnt work, i say this because experience glitching exploits were heavily abused before current patch.  That would essentially reward the cheaters by making them practically gods. Disarming turrets to reach high levels of 200+.  
---
X-x that dmg who cares one star
---
A brief glimpse through your post history shows you attempting to troll all over this sub with these kinds of shit posts, in one post you even state “type all you want there’s nothing you can say to change my behavior”, so I won’t entertain you.
---
Shit post away little fella.
---
I used to put my cute little brick camp there... until people started destroying it 😢
---
Yes I encountered this. 
---
Cores are easy as heck to get
---
If only they somehow reversed that fusion core glitch it was helpful to say the least
---
Shit fix?
---
Because this community accurately represents the current feeling that the playerbase has of the game. What good would it do for them to only listen to the  positive ones out there that dont accurately represent how the majority feel about this game. They’re here to hear the negative shit so they can fix it. How else would they go about doing that?
---
This sub is super toxic and whiny. Just play it and form your own opinion. Some people make valid criticism but a lot are just super dramatic about everything. 
---
As a more casual player only having reached level 42 currently, I generally disagree. My friends that don't play as much as me dislike the same issues that are complained about on here, especially disconnects, crashes, framerate issues on console, and other QoL issues that would not be present in any other game, and if anything, the largest issue for all of my friends has always been build limit.
---
I just happen to like reddit and keep up to date on multiple subs, but even the people that are very low levels believe that issues are rampant throughout the game and believe that it needs fixed. Even my friends that don't play the game think it's a joke, and they're putting 0 hours in, or in some cases an hour or two on someone else's account to try it out, which shows they're definitely not the 'diehard fans'. 
---
Literally anyone informed about the patch doesn't like it, and if anything this update has only hurt more casual players because they aren't informing themselves on the patch, and aren't noticing why they're overweight, and why their game is crashing more than the last patch.
---
Please Bethesda just roll back this update.
---
I feel like I'm going to get a lot on hate from white knights, but it's true. Most players don't like the patch and that's it. 
---
Wow, that has got to be the best glitch I've ever seen, a lootable living mob. BGS = Buggy Game Syndicate.
---
Also what’s max strength and is unyielding armor a perk because I can’t find it
---
I get what you're saying, but the problem is that the game isn't in a good state. Nerfs are always controversial - even with polished games like Overwatch - and it's an extremely silly move when the multiplayer game is still garbage. Right now, they have a glorified co-op game. I don't see what the big deal of overpowered weapons in that state. 
---
Their goal needs involve improving the combat and making a more enjoyable co-op experience. Nerfing White Knight and explosive weapons just makes the game more annoying.
---
There is hope for the franchise. Fallout is a huge massively popular franchise. But I don’t think there’s any hope for Fallout 76 unless they completely rework the game from the ground up which I have no evidence of them planning to do. New content won’t save a broken game
---
I mean the point wasn't to show off a rather common loot drop.. the point is 'hey at least there are still common alternatives that have good damage post patch'
---
Get on my server! 
---
Cant speak on the explosive perk (no exp either way) - but I'll tell you what I experienced in Watoga.  I was just running around stealth sniping lvl 50 prot's - it takes me 3 shots (2 if its nighttime and I get the crits) from my furious CR.  Saw another guy in PA running around with an explosive (not sure if it was TS) rifle (not sure what kind - looked like another CR) doing the same (non stealth though, just RnG) so I thought I'd see just how much weaker they made EX weapons.  It was taking him one more shot then me to take them out.  That seems pretty balanced to me when you take into account sneak attack v/s non-sneak attacks, stealth v/s non-stealth, etc...
---
TLDR - I just dont see the problem with people who think TSE's being next to worthless now - they just look balanced to me.  But thats just MHO.
---
A lot of trial and error with the weapons workbench and the tent lol. really only seemed to fit that back wall. the other two slide nicely on to the sides in pretty much any place I’ve had a tent. 
---
With a jetpack and vats? That headshot one shot hmmm? 
---
Where do you find the witches dress?
---
I haven't had any of those things happen except occasional disconnected, which I haven't had once since two updates ago. Unfortunately no one's paying me, my friends have the same experience. We're burnt out from playing so much.
---
How you get it to be 2k? Mine only says 145 ;(
---
Yes I agree with that too. 
---
It's just infuriating to hear someone complain about how their weapon only does 300 damage after the nerf, when my version of the same weapon only does 132. 
---
But guns absolutely need a buff. Heavy guns in particular, especially Gatling lasers. The Ultracite Gatling laser is something that takes grinding to get, and when you finally do, it's a complete joke that breaks really fast. 
---
But that is only one example that I have experience with as a heavy guns build.  I have no doubt that there are countless other people with other builds that are frustrated with other weapons.
---
I seen a YouTube vid where the guy was going around punching  with that steal fist and one shot lvl 68 super mutants but that’s ok unrealistic right there 
---
Its to stop duping ridiculous amounts of items. This is a great feature on their part as it basically annihalated mass duping large items such as plastics
---
With how stingy they are with stash size, because they're worried about straining the server with data entries, I imagine being able to name our weapons would overstress the servers they're running off of 2008 Dell PCs that they bought secondhand from a local Highschool.
---
&gt;Patches. Patches never change.
---
I wouldn't mind if they had the same cap limit but every individual vendor had their own caps.

perks, unyielding gear, &amp; bloodied affix

---
Love the idea of map invisibility. So how about if you select a location within the blast zone, it won’t take you there, instead it’ll put you right outside of it. As if your character went “oh hell no” before continuing.
---
Wow I really suck at doing my perks only been able to get my 2* bloodied deathclaw to 500
---
Given that it's almost impossible to run out of ammo with the hunting rifle anyway, there's not much reason to constrain .308 crafting. They'd just need to give the .50 receivers a new purpose.

There won't be a new content if players constantly whine about everything and keep demanding fixes. They have their limits 
---
No I was thinking of sneaky sneaky chameleon one shot body shot
---
Lol. Solution. Someone else said this. Put the stash size back to 400 (maybe even 300) and make junk weightless in your stash box. Then we can name things
---
If you think games haven’t been worse than this you haven’t played many games. Especially online games. Hell one nuked itself and made that part of the story upon relaunch.
---
It is also to stop strain on servers for having to deal with so many items being moved at once.. imagine the strain of 90000 items being moved at once on one person on the server. They changed it, and it is a great change imo.
---
very weird for me too. i would sneak fine but as soon as i equipped my rifle (still hidddn, sneak perk maxed) went straight to danger and they are shooting.
---
The loud majority was never here to begin with. Everything you've seen inside FO76 was the silent majority from launch in October. The majority was the rest of the internet minus this subreddit, who was the loud minority from the get go, now they are a loud minor minority. Or loud minority^2 or maybe its now now loud minority^4.
---
Then why are we all bulking stuff other than aluminum and lead? If we can just sell without bulking, why do it? 
---
You're not far off the mark there u/ONEMANCLAN530   
---
Vendor prices were originally based on rarity. Guaranteeing their appearance in a Vendor’s inventory significantly increased the availability of most plans and recipes, and we’ve increased their cap prices as a result. Cap prices have been set relatively high to allow for a market to still exist where players can mod others’ equipment for a cheaper price. 
---
Exactly. The game can be good or even great and still need fixing. 
---
Go to Poseidon and activate the fusion core generator and let it build cores for you while you do your homework or clean or something 
---
PS4
---
After today’s update, if I have bulked junk in my inventory, it will scrap when I “scrap all junk”
---
Just wasted a ton of plastic. 
---
How is posts about quitting a game and dupers playing innocent supposed to help fix the game?
---
It was poorly written but on point, worth the effort to take extra time reading.

Ps4?

A multiplayer fallout experience. It may not always work or be balanced but grab a buddy and kill some super mutants. If you already own it I think it's worth the experience.
---
Yeah, when I lived in Dallas and Phoenix, I spent all of my spare time hitting the lakes or hunting, fishing, etc. Now, especially in the winter, I am stuck inside too often. I need to finish putting insulation in my garage so at least I can be using it as the wood shop like I do from April until December. 
---
You forgot grenadier :p
---
All of those could be issues, they're things worth checking. You could have a PC held together by bubblegum for all I know.. people that aren't tech savvy usually have a hot mess for a computer- and you know that shit is true.
---
The reason I suggested all that is because from what I've seen, PC players are all bitching about a wider variety of issues, but most have their own unique issues as well.. which seems likely to me to be because their computer has unique issues.
---
I'm just glad I don't work for Bethesda, you people are all toxic as fuck the last few days.
---
I use a Gatling Plasma, and it breaks in under four cores, and that's with gunsmith 5 and having it repaired to 200%. So yeah, I feel your pain.
---
Except it's a great source of information as long as you aren't citing it as a source in something like an academic paper, and no, not anyone can edit it and have it there forever. 
---
Read and listen to the lore that can be found on terminals, holotapes and notes. That's one of the places Bethesda is still capable of shining. The stories, while all tragic (no human npc's after all) are rich with depth, emotion and, many times, loss. Gives a rich backstory to a game where most detractors fail to see past the lack of npc's for their handfed plotlines
---
Y’all best then stick to the forest son, this ain’t no place for a level 15.
---
Working fine for me on PS4 - even stayed in caution when a SB landed right next to me (scared the crap out of me though because I'd lost track of him. XD)
---
They SHOULDNT be making new content right now anyway. They should be fixing the inane amount of issues this game has. And btw “demanding” fixes by whining is the only way to get fixes. That’s why we got all the small fixes we got so far
---
Concur, seems like every time I turn around I'm parched or dehydrated. They definitely mucked something up.
---
Reminds me of Dr. Brian Vigil from Fallout 4 honestly..
---
I regret that I have but one downvote to give for this shitpost.
---
So I have a theory. If you place multiple purifiers next to each other, and hook all of them up, but only hook ONE of them up to the main power source, there ends up being a bit of a lag in power moving from the first purifier to the others. 
---
r/fallout76filthycasuals
---
I'm not here for upvotes, and I was giving you your own advice- which you really should take.
---
I viewed it more as a hot take like with political talk shows or whatever.  It's a quick reaction, i.e. like a quick update to fix something. 
---
I think people Quitting the game is the strongest motivational factor they have right now. 
---
Some trapper mod plans (ultralight, dense, deep pocketed etc) show up as world spawns, usually next to an armor workbench. 
---
You can also get plans to construct trapper armor the same way, and craft your own for scrapping. Otherwise trapper armor shows up fairly often in safes or dropped by enemies.
---
The sockman cometh! #makethishappen #newcryptid I'd fight a diseased sockman, maybe this cryptid is a boss with cat "lackies" or satilite enemies... attracted to the socks but also frenzied
---
Try making a difficult build or what is keeping me entertained PvP. I would advise doing the main story plus all the other storylines intill you get high enough level then go on the hunter-hunted radio it makes for some good times
---
thanks!
---
Or eight 200lb dumbbells.
---
Imagine the server trying to calculate 200lb items. Better have a fire extinguisher on hand.
---
Active players now are 500k, across all platforms around the world. 2 months ago it was 1 million. The game is bleeding players. Eventually is gonna stabilize at 100k-200k and is gonna be an slow downhill, like every online game.
---
MMOs in average lose 60%-70% of their players after 3 months. Is normal. 
---
Hardcore players have so much power in MMO games because they make the builds, do the damage formulas, crack rotations, new players that want to optimize look up to these guys and copy them.
---
Fallout76 has an unnusual amount of casual players because is a Fallout game. If this was any other ordinary MMO by this point the only people left would be the hardcore and try hard players.
---
A hot fix is an unscheduled quick fix, like today's. They don't always have to have a download, but depending on their setup they may have to bring the servers down, even if it is just for a reboot. A hotfix is still a patch. 
---
Anyone else looking to quench their post apocalyptic void left by this game with FC: Zero Dawn? I've already droped FO76 to go back to finish FC5 in preparation for FC:ZDs release. I get it'll have non of the lore of FO, but it will have a post apocalyptic world full of NPCs and an engaging story line I'm sure. And vehicles! Pretty stoked for it at the moment.
---
There is one just left to the cranberry bog that has no enemy spawn locations and has a large pool of water but I can't remember an exact pinpoint location 
---
Preach...
---
Thanks for posting some reason amongst the howling of the prima donnas
---
My man.
---
Why, because I haven't had any problems playing my game for over a month? Because I haven't had a single game crash in two weeks? 😂 That doesn't make me a fanboy, I've played the shit out of this game and got my money out of it as far as I'm concerned.. now I'm just burnt out and eating popcorn watching you all try to validate each other.
---
Exact same thing happened 20 minutes ago on PS4. That and the Super Mutant boss that had a seemingly infinite amount of stimpacks during a super mutant horde event in ash heap...
---
Wow didnt knew you were on Reddit. Im a big fan of your fo4 build videos. Very cool to see a fo76 camp. Hope to see more from you!
---
Sometimes you just dont have a chance to scrap. I've done white spring runs and been about 1200lb over carry weight just from mainly weapons and armor. Just didnt want to stop and take time to sell, drop or scrap because I'd miss out on killing/xp
---
No multiplayer experience? Doesn't the studio own ESO?  Or does Bethesda have no part in that?
---
Starched Gene's perk 
---
I agree. I am going to make a new character anyways so there’s no point 
---
Build into a semi shallow lake. The foundations can handle a little depth before they error as floating, gives you a great watery home you can roleplay with as having a dock. I've got one backed up against some cliffs and on a lake just west of Johnson's Acre, south east of the vault in the bottom of the savage divide and the only things that visit my camp are dogs, wolves, rats and the rare ghoul
---
I didn't say it's ruining the game. You may just be looking to pick a fight. Have a nice day.
---
mirelurk queen I believe is on that list, theirs a challenge under combat that lists the cryptids as well. On PC I am also unable to get any flowers to show as being picked and have taken multiple pics at all the Red Rocket's without a single one registering, and don't even get me started on all the other career ones that "just DON'T work".
---
They are both working on TES6 and Starlight and writing up their next hype lines for E3 ... and how to avoid ever talking about Fallout 76 ever again 
---
Getting the starched genes perk which reduces the chance of removing that mutation, I believe there two tiers on thst perk
---
I've suspected that as well. I never chain them - if one gets broken then they all lose power. So I have one central pylon, and wires to each purifier. Might try moving my generator closer and hooking some straight up to the source tho.
---
Controversy often fuels the fires...it's a given.
---
PC? I can toss them your way. 
---
The neigh sayers are not end gamers. They are half ass newbs.
---
Not everyone with high levels cheated to get there. It is ignorant to think some people that blanket statement
---
The game has so much potential based on available content but endgame is so stale that players have started to pretend to be NPCs.  Factions would have helped with making endgame more interesting by having players wage massive event based battles but thats not going to happen with the games current direction.   Players who are traders have lost virtually all ability to trade at reasonable prices , massive in game price inflation for plans has made caps literally useless, too many bugs/ glitches make game unplayable, pipboy unusable, missions unable to be completed die to bugs. Fusion core processors glitched, invisible enemies, enemy movement glitchd, melee weapons are literally stringer than nukes and missiles and grenades, players can become practically invincible with sentinel armor.  Repair costs have grown, guns and armor break so often  youll practically break 5 weapons in your inventory fighting the queen while overencumbered.  VATS is still horrendous to navigate to the actual body part youre targeting and by the time you find it your AP is gone.  Scorchbeast queen drops are so terrible nobody wants to receive an ultracite explosive vent for the seventh time in a row.  Legendary enemies arent dropping legendary armor or weapons.  Players are only contesting your owned workshops just to find your camp and legally destroy it without bounties, Fallout 76 is currently a failed abortion at best. 
---
Random drop on a trick-or-treater's body near Crevasse Dam.
---
You do realize that the reason 3\* god-roll legendaries are 300-400 caps is that they're duped, right?
---
yawn,  TLDR;  next!
---
So 10% of 9%? ;)
---
God that is annoying AF!
---
Thank ya thank ya!
---
The random encounter event that spawns south of Crevasse Dam sometimes has a tent that has trapper plans in it.
---
First of all you understand getting 1500lb + max carry weight will literally mean you move at one inch per second
---
I’m all modded out these days but it’s nice to see the community is still pushing on even now. Cheers to you and the rest of the fellow freecoders out there. May the syntax parse in your favor, friend.
---
At some point, the fanboys in this sub must realize that these community managers are just saying anything to appease people, right? 
---
They'll just say one thing, the thing turns out to be a lie, they apologize, and people eat it up. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Exactly, extremely cucumbered people should be banned immediately.
---
My mother was a saint!
---
I wish I had a shop. I like my geeky projects but don’t have the space. I like building movie props.
---
Gotta upgrade that perk one more time for it to actually be handy. I have it so when equipped it never cures mutations with aid.
---
Not as much as a turret i'd say probably somewhere between 2-4 percent of the budget, I'm in the middle of another patch at the moment or i'd hop on and tell you exactly how much space it takes up.
---
i firmly believe the main complainers are ones who rely to heavily on explosive weapons and power armor. It seems to be that their idea of "fun" is "easy".
---
The freaks come out at night

Im having the same issue in harpers ferry. Already lost a dozen loots because of that. Luckly no legendaries.
---
I was at my camp when two players showed up and started talking to each other on vc like they first met right then and there. Then they started wrecking my fusion gen while still casually talking. I am not even on hunter hunted radio
---
you could call it a ten bit, if anyone even remembers what 2 bits means.
---
I dont know about that, I think it should do a search of inventory to seek repeating items vs a lot of scrap and guns 
---
Sweet baby Jesus 
---
I really liked the lake next to top of the world rail station but it got too busy with other campers. 
---
There’s a perception check for getting the key off the raider boss on Rose’s missions, and the daily for the waste barrels has an agi check. Those are the only ones I’ve seen. 
---
And no, higher luck doesn’t help elsewhere. This is quest specific coding
---
I was thinking about picking it up. So, you’re liking it so far? I heard it’s a lot different from the original (obviously) but I’m cool with a fresh take. 
---
I will give you my pipe pistol
---
Oh and cap stashes have been reduced exponentially, have 3 points in cap collector? Congrats the cap stash you just searched has only one cap in it, even though its a stash it makes total sense because bethesda.  
---
I've experienced bugs and other issues with the game, but I would say that overall I've had a good experience and I'm continuing to have a lot of fun with it. I hope that Bethesda continues to improve upon the game.
---
...cap collector doesn’t even work half the time. For me, so far, it hasn’t worked AT ALL. I get no search option.
---
Isn't bulking for the purposes of selling? 
---
Agreed.
---
Level 87 and 48 characters.  Casualness level: all the main quests, did nuke zones once or twice.
---
There are bugs that sometimes cost extra time (disconnects), rituals I have to follow, but nothing game breaking.  Even the regression fuckups just mean a few more rituals (sell excess bobby pins, don’t scrap all when holding bulk).
---
I’m still actively playing, solo, because I feel like there’s nothing else quite like the good parts of this game.
---
I bought the game for a friend, but haven’t pushed him to play it with me, since when working as designed it’s already on the edge of what he would enjoy (all this inventory management?  all these unintuitive systems to learn?).  We enjoyed Destiny 2.  We’ll probably get and enjoy Anthem.  When we’re done with that, maybe this game will be stabilized for us to do together.
---
I kinda like it, I’m trying to see if I can get combat armor to look good with it right now. Sturdy looks okay but all the waist belt pockets look a bit much, light combat might wor
---
Beautiful. Love the video mate. 
---
I'm thinking they are abandoning ship. There's no fix to this game and fanbase. Whatever they do is gonna result in an uproar and that's very demotivating. TSE nerf was a change in right direction and people start whining and talk about quitting the game. And watching those whining threads getting thousands of upvotes was just ridiculous
---
\&gt; So maybe legitimate players are sometimes getting banned when super duper proc's   
---
Imagine that
---
..did you get your chunky water from my porta pottie by chance..? Cause boy, do I have some news for you..
---
My new mission is to find every dog bowl and plastic plate in west virginia. 
---
That's easily the best camp I've seen.
---
I am beginning to feel the same, unfortunately I am Canadian and don't think the class action suits being filed may not apply to me. I want at least half my money back and to keep the game, should have been free to play anyway considering the state it's in.
---
That’s because running around with OP TSE guns made you feel powerful and feeling powerful was the only source of enjoyment left in this game
---
Tripling the area, not the diameter or radius, if that makes you feel better.  It's actually not much wider due to how circles work.
---
Better suggestion 
---
Covers whole map
---
Deletes everyone above ground's game 
---
Really? Since when?
---
Challenge accepted
---
-Todd Howard
---
Yeah, that was the point, to make it a mainstream game to sell more. Capitalism my friend.
---
who am i trying to validate? you’re like the 10% of people who still like this game. so have fun i guess. itll be dead soon anyway when they actually fix the damn launcher so people can uninstall it
---
I think they should make it so the stash automatically breaks down any junk item (that isn't used in other recipes) down to their base materials so the stash only has to keep track of each junk type which is just the data entry of that junk type being in your stash and how many there are.
---
Yes. Quite possible. 
---
Bethesda, using the 20+ year old engine that couldn't
---
That's perfect. How long do you live at 2hp though?
---
You can control the colors on the light boxes.
---
Old meets new! (Or the inverse..?).  
---
We are trying, and hoping, but the run around is, well fairly epic still. 
---
also play hologames :)
---
TSE legendaries are currently being hurled away. A lot have been duped for sure but there isn’t much value in a gun that just got nerfed so hard that if you weren’t specced into it from the ground up you’d feel like you just threw a teddy bear at a Deathclaw 
---
Nuke completely deleted game off of your platform. End game!
---
Things in your stash don't unbulk.  
---
is there a video on where it is and how to make it spawn?
---
No just have it break all their gear.  Now get studying!!
---
So they nerfed TSEs and we are now demanding buffs. See where this is going? in normal games, devs would just say fuk off and go on to nerfing melee builds and making a balanced game and all will be fine. But with fo76, devs just have to make those little fixes so that community wouldn't flip. Very productive
---
I take it receiving an email is out of the question
---
It'll be great for when there's actual group content with empath serum.
---
Did they ever fix this?
---
Its an example buddy, its not ignorant because the fact that people disarmed turrets over and over nonstop actually happened and is something ignorant to leave out of the conversation.  Heres another example,  practically 75% of the entire playerbase had a tse, but not everyone duped theirs to get it, however since most were duped it was nerfed because those weapons had a damage output that was godly and they were so common, many people took advantage of the xp exploits and should not be rewarded with godly power for doing so even though the common players who grinded to get to that level should rightfully be more powerful.  Even though OP’s idea makes sense the fact of the matter is that the previous exploits ruin it for everyone just like duping ruined the TSE. 
---
Xbox, sadly.
---
Try the dry lake bed north east of Charleston, it's flat and has water, or build on/slightly over the creek anywhere south of the Mothman museum.
---
Cool, if you're on ps4, can I have your caps and ammo then?
---
Bye
---
Thats awesome there is so much detail in this game
---
All too much, and sadly, I think it follows that casuals are that much more hopeless if they don't tap into this Market
---
Are we really trying to grill bethesda over terminology?
---
Fuck this sub
---
Nah, every game community I’ve been a part of like Destiny and The Division, the devs have made fixes according to what the player base was bitching about the most. We are what keeps their game profitable 
---
Yes I see your point, but those damage perks affect an entire class of weapons.  Explosives are pretty useless as it stands now with the exception of the (now slightly less glorious) TSE weapons.  They should have just made Demolition Expert not enhance the legendary explosive effect.
---
I only started experiencing after the update before the last.  Really bugs me when the double doors are closed at the club and I'm getting chased by a horde of GG'S
---
I don't know. If you spawn there it's just a little to the south. You can change server to get another random encounter. Each time it's something different. You can get the Witches and Skeleton costume plans also there.
---
As a coaster for the controller..
---
End game content shouldn't be survivable by a non end game player.  Its whybtheres a ton of lvl nothings hopping into one hit the queen and run for shelter,  making it hard for everyone else.  Raising the difficulty of the zone would fix things.
---
Depends on what the temperature is outside weather the water in the porta pottie would be chunky or not. 
---
LOL
---
Your lagging and desynced
---
"You are not the majority" is a very bad argument, but I would still like to see you prove that statement.
---
That's what a hardcore gamer with multi hundreds of hours of time invested would say. As the OP mentioned, you should look from casual's point of view as well. 
---
Ah. Right right. See you again in 2077? I here that's when the live action game is coming out. 
---
Well, at roughly 100hp with blocker, suppressor, serendipity, dodgy, barbarian, evasive, nerd rage, decent modded armor and the ability to 1 shot everything that's not a scorched queen.... quite a while actually
---
&gt;orbital strikes for 1 cap
---
First off all it takes to craft them are 5 gears, 5 fiber optics, 2 raw yellowcake and 10 steal. For someone who doesn’t do much crafting but hoards materials you can make a literal boatload of these especially with super duper at level 3 as it has closer to a 40-50% chance to craft 2 items. They aren’t really the most resource heavy items to make. Also I’m not seeing these insanely low prices you’re talking about. The prices are a tad low but then again the world just got nerfed to kingdom come. Anything shy of furious or bloodied or melee has very little value as you need an entire set of perks just to do decent damage with it
---
nope you get the +25 and you would have a 30 min period of negative effect suppression. The second serum would just extend that negative effect suppression by another 30 mins IIRC.
---
serums do not stack.
---
This answers my question. Is the game any better than last year?
---
If you're bulking items and not selling them like it's intended to why are you holding them
---
You can't post sarcasm I suppose. 
---
Great Idea, wish I had gold to give, but have my upvote at least.
---
Well, if you actually use them and make a bunch of stuff, you get banned as a duper, so I think OP made the right choice.
---
I wasn't being serious. 
---
Since the update bulking is only useable for selling resources. Don’t waste your plastic bulking unless you’re gonna immediately put it in your stash
---
I had this problem too.. I just completely unequipped my cards are reequipped them and it fixed it for me. It also fixed another long standing issue I had with not having certain perk cards, most notably Ammosmith. After I reequipped I finally had that card.
---
:Blink:  
---
SON OF A B..
---
But... But look what have they done with TSE! Let me show you... \*unzips his fly\*
---
The best part is you only have to have the perk active when you’re curing rads. The worst part is I believe you have to be level 30 and it’s kind of rng unless I’m wrong.
---
Honestly, I can’t wait for elder scroll 6.
---
Just created 8 radium rifles and ran out of screws. I should have waited and just lugged them around. Instead I scrapped them, one at a time and got 1 mod for the effort. 
---
I *think* the cutoff to scrap a bunch at the same time is ten. 
---
Almost every german gamer speaks english. If you don‘t mind tze acczent. 
---
also is it armor plans or mod plans?
---
Delicious 
---
Yeah, that should never be the case. Hopefully they right this ship and rethink weapon design.
---
pretty sure it has to do with all of the pieces of your power armor being included in the 10 lb weight if your power armor chassis, when you are wearing it all armor pieces go back to their normal individual weight 
---
im pc and I could use some items XD
---
legendary armor effect.  + ? to all stats except END when low on health i believe.
---
Right?  Like with that many hours in such a short amount of time... they'd have to be playing at least 7 hours a day everyday since release.  
---
Like goddamn. I like the game but jeez, go outside every now and then.
---
The armor plans.
---
I haven’t seen him in a long while. I read a thread about his rarity and the rarity of the hunters longcoat, and decided to try server-hopping for the vendor. Found the vendor bit on the first try, and bought the hunters longcoat b/c I didn’t want to skip it and miss out. Sure enough, I haven’t seen the vendor bot since. 
---
(I think I saw him a couple times before when I was low-level and either didn’t have enough caps to buy much or didn’t have need for what he was selling yet)
---
I was having all sorts of strange stuff happening to corpses while going through the Asylum 
---
That's unfortunate. Guess I've been lucky with my mass murder; nothing has disappeared on me. 
---
Are you sure you have all the materials?
---
I’d actually be really interested in the breakdown because I have a feeling the hardcore players are the only ones still sticking around. 
---
This is the equivalent of being told to work at a restaurant because you got punched in the neck by a waiter for getting upset that almost every dish is shit and a chore to eat except those two that everyone always goes for or sneaks in leftovers of from previous visits.
---
aw okay I already got them, and sorry to annoy you. but anywhere I can find out all the trapper mods that I can get from scrapping?
---
Yes. I made sure. 
---
Screw the modders.
---
I don’t want them to touch this game.
---
I would agree with this if this was the way it always was. This is a bug, and it was introduced today.
---
Any mods?
---
no I am not this happens even when I am not in the area there are random meat piles appearing with no other players in the area with random loot on them
---
Dont know then I'm not having any trouble 
---
Good luck on getting a hotfix for this.. nobody at Bethesda seems to listen. I run a stealth build as well. Probably months before they even bother to notice it.
---
What level are you?
---
Good for you then. 
---
These posts are just annoying. Nobody cares that you’re leaving and posting about it is pointless. I’m glad someone like you is leaving the game, please never come back. 
---
Well, if someone wants to flex over being a game developer.
---
Probably looks like video surveillance in an insane asylum. 
---
PC- seems fixed for me now but definitely an issue earlier.
---
I agree as I've saved some items for my husband once we have separate xbox's.. and I'm getting a bit nervous as to what is right and wrong in their eyes exactly 
---
Oh my god... he duped in a fallout game? Jesus christ, what a monster. What is this world even coming to where people dupe in an rpg? Holy shit now I live terrified that one day some random guy on a server is going to dupe items in for himself, how can I continue playing this bug-riddled, incompetent game when monsters are doing crimes as heinous as duping? Bethesda, please ban me so I never have to live in fear again.
---
You will have to be disciplined in weight management. Dump strong back if you want a strong melee. Need to use all 15 points in strength. 
---
Those games you mentioned... Can't say they are in a good state. You see, listening to player base doesn't always end up with good results. I hope bethesda learns that and try to sculpt the game to a right direction. Rather than listening to whining players
---
Yes this is the perfect example. Hopefully in a new patch they will implement some system like this! 
---
our armor that is deep ocked isnt counting when we get in the power armor. that's not right and needs fixed. always been like that.
---
Power plants are still a thing. You can even build a fusion generator if you don’t want to power up the plant first 
---
Maybe it's just a small problem, try server hopping, and also what platform are you on?

I heard outdated mods are crashing folks on pc. Cannot confirm as I’m on console.  Hope that helps.
---
I just thought about that. I guess I’ve just never paid enough attention until now.

oh ya the chat mod actually
---
That's the point. Their policy clearly states that installing a game purchased through their launcher makes it impossible to get a refund. 
---
Check your state's/country's laws surrounding digital purchases and see if those laws trump this policy. Regardless though, again, this is asking for a refund on something you bought three months ago. Literally no place that sells anything is going to refund you for a purchase made that long ago.
---
How can you tell about spawn locations?
---
Er... You don't have all 9 points of slugger, do you?
---
Because incisor and Martial artist are much more important.
---
A jiff!
---
If you are in an area and never see enemies most likely there arnt any spawn locations near 
---
I think it’s more likely they would stop supporting FO. If the game was installed but their records of active users seemed to be less, then I think they’d feel more inclined to make improvements to get those people playing again as that’s basically market share they can claim easier
---
Sure it will. And this subreddit will be a good town too then right? Or do you all just stick around to whine and complain? 😂
---
I started a new post, but want to know if this hypothetical could happen.
---
If I have two characters, both legit levelling and resource collecting, and I trade with a friend for a resource, then swap characters and trade back for the same resource. 
---
Is that against the terms of conditions for the game?
---
Earning resources and trading vrs. muling. What's the law?
---
My Gt: CRAZY I AM NOT. maybe not today but i will have u on my friends list so i  will hit u up next time if i launch nukes
---
You're definitely right. For me on PS4 at least. I took an old level 100 out of mothballs and stored every thing in his camp except the fusion generator. Plopped 3 industrial ones right in the river and just watched them produce. It's nowhere near 60 an hour even if that was evenly split between the 3 of them. That's a damned issue. I'm gonna check the one at the junkyard.
---
Agree, the whole way the handled the balance issue proved they don't understand the root of the balance issue in the first place, and took the harder of the roots to solve the problem.   
---
Editing the original legendary effect so it didn't benefit from the Demo based perks alone would have resolved the issue in its entirety, reverting it to a flat 25 point DMG buff.  
---
Cloning the legendary effect, and moving it to the Prefix (primary) legendary slot, would have allowed it to still exist, benefit from perks and tweaking it so it benefited at let's say 50% to start, would have avoided the whole gutting of the demo build.  
---
And for the love of all things (un)&amp;holy please don't start the "two shot is OP also!".. It's not, especially compared to bloodied. 
---
Actually Destiny and Division both made a complete transformation and improved their games tenfold. Both games were trash in release and after years of work they both did a complete turnaround. By then end the division was an awesome game with tons of content and so was Destiny 1. Can’t speak about Destiny 2 because I quit only a few months in
---
I was playing daily for 2-3 hours. Now my build is totally shit and worthless so I’m taking a break, maybe permanent. Level 150 just gone to shit. 
---
Shame as I really enjoyed it up until the last patch. 
---
Hey sounds good to me. I don't have many people i actually play with on here. Just acquaintances. 
---
 It is ok?  Have you looked at the damage a Balck Powder or a TDragon can do it is kind of meh, nad lets not even get into legendaries.  
---
Yeah I’ve known about that for awhile. I actually lose carry weight if I’m in anything but Excavator. 
---
[https://i.ibb.co/5WvGhVk/armor-mods.png](https://i.ibb.co/5WvGhVk/armor-mods.png)
---
thank you so much!
---
Dude. This games buggy af. 
---
Of course I served hopoed, restarted, removed/reapplies perks, etc etc.   
---
I even patted my head and sang the ding national anthem.  
---
I still can’t repair my ranged weapons. 
---
If your not having the issue yet, be glad as it’ll probably get you sooner or later. 
---
It’s a multiplayer game.
---
Go play fallout 4 if that’s what you truly desire.
---
Then don’t walk into the fallout of a nuclear explosion. Nobody is forcing you to go in. If you do however, put on the power armor designed to handle that environment
---
I agree with him.
---
There most recent patch nuked the reddit. Almost literally. It was and kinda still is quite the show
---
Yeah I've seen it and I'm not very impressed with its lack of armor piercing 
---
Cool, you should make a video so we can all watch :)
---
I've tried the build but it takes sooooo much to get right and then it takes a lot of preparation to get in a situation where it's useful.
---
I've watched hours of video of cheeseburgercake refining it.
---
Thank you!!
---
Thank you. It seems another survivor of a new plague called hypocrites. The community got nuked by An update called nerfing TSE which people raged at despite begging for it.
---
Yep. Is earning and trading against the TOS?
---
It's a legitimate question and if it's going to get me banned from the game and my Bethesda account, I want an official response.
---
dang but I dont understand it
---
I'm not sure. I've never used mods with 76.
---
But there was an update with the chat mod that fixed the issue after patch 5. Not sure if it works after hotfix, though. 
---
"you already bought our shit, so why should we continue to care about you moron?"
---
Yeah and it’s +3. Good for bloodied builds.
---
Is there any fix for this currently other than restarting the game? It sucks. 
---
Did you take the mats out of your stash though?
---
Well I don't want to game with 420rocksxoxo either but it is what it is.
---
Store all your materials in your stash then try again.  
---
PS4. New patch can’t repair ranged weapons. Says don’t have requirements which I did/do at rank 3.    Have all the items on me not in bulk too. And it’s amazing losing my main weapon. 
---
Guess I’ll just punch everything like you seem to want us to do. 
---
I don't think being tired of dealing with bugs is the same as lack of content.
---
Agree.  
---
The way they handled the "balance" proved they don't understand the core mechanics of the game, balance issues as a whole, or how the perks interact.  
---
There were dozens of good suggestions on how to better handle it, example.  
---
    
---
   
---
 "Two shot was never a problem, and didn't need a rebalance, especially compared to bloodied. 
---
I get that the game can’t handle leaving objects in world so they can despawn after hitting an object, but it would be an amazingly fun way to throw out our leftover scraps. 
---
All I'm seeing here is devoted hardcore players rage quitting after tse nerfs lul. But I do agree hardcore games are and will be the most loyal despite all the bitching they throw on bethesda
---
Well I hope you figure things out, sounds really bad to have that happen 
---
It’s a legendary effect. I’ve got a full set of mismatched armor. Personally I’d go for full marine armor but realistically you’ll be one shorting most things so unless you’re doing pvp you can just use whatever armor with the right legendary effects.
---
The scene from Ghostbusters 2, "Lets see what happens when we remove the puppy."
---
It fails its players.
---
Maybe two budgets? One under ground one above? 
---
Could simply be an instances apartment like most MMO’s do with player housing.
---
Just create a cellar door or something and it will take you to the instance.
---
No extra wear for anyone on the map!
---
lol you guys care a lot about this game. this game sucks and y’all should move on, that’s free advice right there
---
You're being downvoted, but you're not really wrong. They're not quite at the toxic levels, not most of them anyway, but they are whiny. And they're totally dramatic to boot. The top few posts of the last couple of days were "I'm quitting" over and over again.
---
E: And if you don't think they're using harvested data (aka telemetry) read this: [obtaining feedback from gamers, how we do it](http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/96195270406/obtaining-feedback-from-gamers-how-we-do-it)
---
I might never bother to install it again...
---
Ok, enough with all this horseshit. Here’s the thing guys....
---
Point#1: You don’t have to like every Fallout game, they don’t all have to be home runs. So, all of you....that hate 76, it’s ok. You can be mad at Bethesda, you can cry and scream and demand your refunds...hold them accountable to it. But please, for the love of God, stop harassing those of us that actually are enjoying it. Why would we, the ones that enjoy it and are having a fine time, bugs and all...why would we hold them accountable when we’re getting our moneys worth. 
---
Point #2: this is brand new ground for Bethesda, if you’re not emotionally capable of waiting for them to work out their issues, as they’ve been trying to do (in a very timely manner, through patches and hot patches) then you should be mad at yourselves, not them. We’re talking about a $35-65 one time purchase game (depending on when you bought it). I’ve personally gotten hundreds of hours of fun already for my $65 purchase. 
---
Point #3: No matter how important all of you guys think you are, you’re really not. Quit taking this as personal slight to your own personal loyalty to Fallout. You don’t have to throw the Baby out with the Bathwater. I know all of you love to slobber all over Obsidian and just how much better they made a Fallout game compared to the company that owns Fallout, but I’d be willing to bet there’s not a single one of you, no matter how much “it sucked” still to this day plays Fallout 4. 
---
So, to sum things up....let’s just let people like what they like, there are plenty of people that are enjoying 76. If you don’t like it, don’t play it. You’ve all made your point, the literal apocalypse happens when the make believe apocalypse doesn’t live up to your standards. I’m sure all of you Basement...oops sorry,  Vault Dwellers could’ve done a MUCH better job developing their first multiplayer Fallout. 
---
Well, if you liked Fallout 1 and 2 best, I'd recommend Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2 and Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. If you liked Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4 best, You could try the Witcher games, or maybe Assassin's Creed Origins/Odyssey.
---
I don't think it's so much as like throwing a teddy bear it's that you're not used to having lower damage 
---
Still haven't started AC: Odyssey...  Its looking more appealing by the day 
---
When you bulk the weight goes down alittle. It's also for organizing and selling.
---
Head west from Alpine River Cabins (North west of Flatwoods) cause that area next to it has a small lake that becomes a river, that leads into the main river on the western side of the map. The area is flat and there aren't as much bushes from what I remember. There is the possibility of mole rats or scorched spawning nearby but they're low level. 
---
What a nonsence i have read? TSE for casuals? What?! Where the hell casual player can take TSE?
---
and here is where the exploding gun people start to say nerf melee but they forget melee has no AOE we literally have to hit every target to kill it .
---
Used all my perks to up demo stats, then to realize making grenades is annoying as hell, and now they're not even worth it. Cool
---
I'm in Japan, they do allow a refund. I have asked many times since release up until now. They just send the same copy paste message.
---
You can also trigger a second event by heading back North and crossing the bridges up that way. Can confirm that the vendor but also can spawn on this trigger. Actually, the only time I got it to spawn was using that trigger.
---
I dont think the weight goes down cause it's all the same weight, I think it's the lack of plastic that makes it feel lighter 
---
Keep it all in your stash until you're ready to sell.
---
**Reddit Views**
---
Reddit is always going to have posts from people taking extreme opinions, but to say they are all the extreme is inaccurate.  There are many people who have posted on reddit their experiences in Fallout 76 in a faithful manner and with the purpose of communicating with Bethesda the issues they have faced.  Bethesda in the past have been very poor in regards to communication. It was feedback received by fans of the game (reddit users) which has helped Bethesda address many issues with Fallout 76.  
---
**Balanced Game**
---
Fallout 76 is the same engine from Fallout 4 which has been retrofitted for online multiplayer.  The "In-balances" were already in the Fallout 4 however it was a single player game so it didn't really matter and those that wanted a more balanced game play could then use a mod of their choice.  When Bethesda decided to get into the online gaming market they should of realised that balance is something that has to be addressed.  They didn't want to balance the game, there was no balancing.  They just wanted to get the game out of the door to take advantage of the huge customer base who purchased Fallout 4.  The retrofitted it an pushed it out the door.
---
**New Content**
---
One of the major statements when the game was announced was "We will be constantly adding new content to the game".  If people knew what they mean't was "We will be constantly adding new content to the Atom Shop" or "We will be releasing the game in an alpha state and patching it over the next 3 months"  I doubt as many people would have purchased the game.  Fallout 4 and previous titles on PC also had the modding community provide heaps of extra content for these games.  I've never seen the player base crying for more content or expansions in the past.  People are asking for more content because to be honest after doing the story missions and side quests there's not much else to the game other than being able to play with friends, which I think is the greatest draw card until your friends stop playing because the games content is not enjoyable anymore.
---
**Min-Maxing**
---
This is a big part of the Fallout universe as well as online competitive games so it's natural to expect a lot of people to do this to some extent.  Crafting and upgrading better items, finding new plans/recipes, improving talent builds, working out efficient farming routes, etc.  Youtube and reddit has a lot of content about min-maxing and helping people understand how the game works.  I doubt this is something the "average" player has no interest in and I'm sure many people have looked at reddit/youtube to get help on things in the game without actually posting about it.
---
**Functional Game**
---
Fallout 76 was released in an alpha state. Experienced Fallout players know there was going to be bugs even if Todd doesn't think so.  The modding community has always maintained "Unofficial patches" for both Fallout and Skyrim while Bethesda saved money moving their developers onto the next project and letting the community fix their games for them.  With Fallout 76 being online and the modding community having less effect on how the game functions they should have realised pushing out the game with very little changes to the game play mechanics was always going to be a problem.  The marketing "beta" for players was a PR stunt in order to get people to pre-purchase as that is all.  I doubt they spent much time internally testing this game.
---
**Engaging Players**
---
The story content can be completed very quickly, once that is done there is not much else to do in game other than farming for gear.  PvP is not enjoyable in any way and encourages griefing, the Nuke Zones if they work (server crashes and un-killable queens) are un-rewarding, event's are boring and repetitive,  scorch beasts become annoying very quickly and workshops have been nerfed into the ground there is no point using them.  If you do engage in some of this content you spend the rest of your time farming for resources to repair/re-equip yourself.  Since release Bethesda have reduced the rewards from this content making the game more and more of a grind.
---
**OP Weapons**
---
As I said above these items where already in Fallout 4 to the point people had made mods to reduce them for a more balance game play and that's single player.  So the lack of vision shown by Bethesda that these items would not cause an issue in a world which encourages PvP is poor.  The bug that allowed players to duplicate items in game created a market to then sell these items on ebay etc. for real money.  This is Bethesda's fault and the player base should not be to blame.  Bethesda could of easily addressed these before release but it looks like they just didn't want to spend money on it to maximise profit.
---
I was never specced for TSE. Or E. Or TS. I built myself like a pack Brahmin. Hand me a TSE Handmade, 1,500 rounds, and I might have that Deathclaw to the ground in about 5 minutes. Explosives never did much damage from me
---
Fan of trump, no wonder he posts this shit 
---
How much they paying you?
---
I chuckled. My gf and I call it cucumbered.
---
Theres still people playing it. I think the people that hung out in the subreddit are giving themselves to much credit and over reacting like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Jesus Christ it’s like the freaking world ended over a weapons nerf. If that’s all it takes for someone to get this upset then maybe you shouldn’t play online games at all. Can we not just continue to fix the game and maybe give Bethesda a little bit of credit for releasing patches in a timely manner? I imagine I would be extremely frustrated if I worked for them because they think they are doing what needs to be done to balance it for it’s upcoming FREE dlc and then I get post after post with so much drama that it could be in a Shakespeare play about how people are quitting. 
---
You can still get great dam out of your tse weapons, you just have to respec your points a bit and streamline. Drop all the fluffer/ quality of life perks and get serious about your build. Most people are just upset that they now have to actually rely on there perk set ups instead of using an OP weapon as a crutch for the lack of dam coming from there builds. 
---
Heard they improved but seems players didn't stick around to see that. Not gonna say those games became amazing cause i got back to playing division several months ago and i decided to switch to fo76. Thats telling a lot
---
Nope, I've put in several tickets to try and get this addressed, but it doesn't seem to be on the list of priorities at the moment.  
---
I can try and tag our good friend.  [/u/lonevaultwanderer](https://www.reddit.com/u/lonevaultwanderer) to come and hopefully take a look, because if my hunch is right, this should be a relatively simple fix.
---
How many caps can you make per hour with your "better way?"
---
Past the initial 1400 to merchants, obviously.
---
The game is broken in more ways than you know. There will be a point where you see it, but I truly hope you don't and keep enjoying it. 
---
You’d probably be surprised. Imagine if you weren’t on this reddit or didn’t have friends to play with and logged on to find you did a minimal fraction of the damage as before. You’re weak and a respec is expensive as hell. After the bumpy road to even get that far, to feel like you might need to reset would end it for me
---
How many hours have you played 76? Just curious, be honest 
---
That doesnt seem right but to be fair never handled one myself 
---
Out of all the issues this trashfire excuse of a download has (notice I didn’t say game, because it’s not even a game at this point) you are worried about  renaming items???
---
Ive been off work with an arm injury since August. Before 76 I heavily played WoW. Im talking artifact power level 30 2 months ahead of anyone else. Its all I could play really.
---
Im at 760 hours in 76. Its all I've played since its launch. I get a full time weekly wage still and do physio daily. I just don't really have much of a life other than work, gaming and my dogs.
---
same. I did drop 5 bucks to top up on a limited time offer and then was ready to shoot myself when it just became a regular item for about 100 atoms more. but after putting over 200 into the game at the start I certainly won't be propping up the atom store with hard currency again. Really suck's that a lot of the career challenges won't complete though.
---
I agree. Most of us have jobs, school, a life where we don’t even have enough time to farm these kinds of guns in the first place.
---
Ladies and gentlemen we got em

I mean I’ve played quite a few hours. I’m level 110 but I’m still pretty casual and I play more than one game. I’ve just been playing it since the beta.
---
game state that you save space even though it's false.

I found Heavy Combat Armor Legs at Watoga Station the first day.  But haven’t seen Arms or Torso yet and legs are now gone. 
---
I saw Sturdy Combat Torso there first day too but didn’t buy it cause I’m holding out for Heavy. 
---
Went everywhere today and didn’t see any Heavy or Sturdy Combat plans.
---
Seems they missed something or it is still a “hop” item,...
---
Wait, if what you say is true...then how did it get upvoted?   Also I feel like many of the top posts are not by dudes with hundreds of hours.   Most seem ignorant of basic things like bloodied ranged weapons killing sbq quickest, where to even get ballistic fiber, how to cripple a scorchbeast and make it land and dense armor mods.   I'd say it's mostly casuals posting and getting upvoted.  
---
Anyway I don't see how any of this justifies the nerf to explosive non legendary things like the missile launcher when they are already so bad.  Only a casual would be trying to use one lol.
---
call me where there is a communitylarger than this for fo76 ? Not saying I'm disagreeing with you but I do think this is there best chance at open discussion.
---
It’s not LITERALLY like throwing a teddy bear and I’m not LITERALLY going to take 5 minutes. I simply stated TSE because it was a great way to justify hurling a radbear at Deathclaws
---
Here's something else.

Unless they've changed it the weight only goes down on aluminum and let everything else you're just poking because it makes you feel better.

Because that’s not how levels work in this game, duh

Oh my god

For the record happened upon him again on different server still no mirror ball

In every MMO I've ever played, I always maintained max level fishing.  Is very important for MMO gaming, fishing.

That's just lame

What you have is whitepsrings. Don't waste your time people. Just another boring whitesprings drop. Yawwwwn.
---
Oh it's one of you people. Look, I'm tired of the "this game sucks" bs. I'm just going to play the game and the very few who still have sanity in the trash fire excuse(notice I didn't say subreddit because it's not a super Reddit at this point) because I'm tired of hypocrites with TSEs and complaints.
---
Wish i could upvote this more. Don't get me wrong, Bethesda deserves all the criticism that goes with releasing a buggy game in the first place, and the lack of clear communication from the start. But. I do see them putting out updates trying to meet the demands and seem to trying. I'm pretty much a casual player myself. I have been on it from the beginning, i got it on release day myself. But from having a life outside gaming that includes both work and other activities,i have only just reached level 12 and explored a small part of the map. It amazes me that people say they are level 200 with hundreds of hours under their belts. You must have enjoyed the game enough, and got your money's worth, this far in to have made it worth your while. Legitimate concerns with the game, bring it up to the devs. But don't ruin it by over thinking. 
---
This is why ubisoft are winning there fans. If a game has issue they communicate with the players ask for feedback and try to make the game better than before. 
---
that would too much fun but they wouldn't do it because it would require real work. 
---
Found the shill.
---
Rad bears? Isn't that a little bearist, there's other bears ya know
---
A junk jet just in general would be fun. Hurl Deathclaw hands at Deathclaws, Assaultron heads at robots and scorched bones at the flying bats
---
I've been able to consistently trigger one of the events per day. Basically I've found if I'm east of Lewisburg and then fast travel to the Lewisburg Station, it will trigger one of Camden Park dailies.
---
Also, remember that you can trade the tokens, so you can consolidate all your tokens into a single character if you like.
---
But it’s all the same gripes. I’m gonna quite cause this sucks. Great, no need to announce it, just uninstall you rebel and calm it a day.
---
Why does anybody care how much money they made? Honestly, does it affect your personal enjoyment of the game? If so, go play Fortnite or CoD. I’m not trying to be a dick, I just honestly don’t understand how the success of a game (through sales revenue) can change someone’s personal enjoyment of it. Who cares if they put it on sales twice? You like it...or you don’t. I personally love it. If you don’t, that’s ok too. But the sale price has zero to do with anything other than people like you trying to influence the rest of us as to a reason to decide that this game isn’t good. Get over yourself. Let people like or dislike what they will, but let them do it on their own. 
---
No one got destroyed. 
---
Bethesda has their issues, every game comapny has their issues. This sub is just about Bethesda. Go look at one for RDR2, D2, or COD, many similar issues are discussed between all of them. 
---
How real definition have less upvotes than bullshit definiton from OP?  Oh yeah this sub is cancer.   
---
If you'll just never go to that restaurant again they will never know that/what they did wrong. 
---
If you talk about the problem though they might fix it. And hey! Maybe someday you see they improved and give it another try.
---
And maybe sone future restaurant owners will take these infos in consideration. And we'll all eventually have a better future gastronomic industry for everyone. 
---
Voting with our wallets is as important as discussing about the problems, and letting the community know what's up to avoid ppl having unpleasant surprises, and for others to build a better future.
---
I genuinely couldn’t remember them all. They added so many. I just wish we could still decorate with them. They’d line my camp walls as defense
---
exactly and thats a problem being my point it should be like how diablo 3 does it or something where we get something for leveling up instead of just cards
---
Wonder what the untested hot fix will break. &gt;Sad laughter&lt;
---
I feel like you've opted to not actually think about what I wrote, opting instead to just disagree right out the gate
---
Ah yes stacking 2000 deathclaw hands to stop am albino death claw 
---
Did you say you can buy the ultracite Gatling laser plans in the enclave bunker?
---
Bullshit. I’ve been running a HW build since day one, never had an explosive weapon, only 2-shot I have is a level 40 Gatling plasma I only use as a last resort weapon (accuracy and durability are too shitty to use as a primary) and I wreck shit. Learn to build, learn to play. 
---
I feel like you are all missing the big picture. We could hide in the fridges whenever a nuke drops. Duh. 
---
Honestly it’s just luck. I ended up with a single  lvl 50 TSE Gatling laser by lvl 100, but a ton of TS weapons and a lvl 25 TSE combat rifle that never worked because of the bug that caused ranged weapons to stop dealing damage.   
---
I did farm whitesprings nukes with a group maybe half a dozen to a dozen times mostly got crappy armor and worthless weapons. 
---
Got a source for your definiton? Lol
---
TEXT CHAT!!
---
Among other things, I want it for /roll !! 
---
I turned my camp into a quest with a little horror themed mystery puzzle to solve. I have clues around the camp and whatnot. Eventually they have to track me down as part of it. So im now the npc if someone walks up to me and mentions the quest.
---
Text chat with a dice roll sim (/roll) would let me expand on what im doing with player choices so much. I could DM the thing a bit better. Allowing the people doing my goofy quest alot more choice. 
---
I also want a journal i write in. That i can place in CAMP for someone to pickup and read.
---
Working with the small letters takes up alot of space and budget.  The neons are a bit too much for what im doing. Its hard to put a whole quest together with them. 
---
Lots of us want lots of stuff lol. 
---
On PC you go into Programs and Features and uninstall from the programs list, cleans it out quite well, what is left can be deleted in the folder itself.
---
Bethesda - Hot Fix = Code change not tested.
---
Yup. Same here. 
---
Whats ur gt
---
Love your points just don't like how we got a reroll on a recent update.
---
Youre perspective sucks
---
You have Rad Worms. Boosts all "spell" type effects by 50%.
---
I like to spend them on plans (maybe learn every single plan), and occasionally at Watoga and Whitesprings random good legendaries people sell either by mistake or because they didn't know what they had.
---
Orbital's might be a weak example, but I can't imagine I can't imagine the set of materials in that recipe being worth 1 cap, let alone profitable to sell at that rate. I have to presume a lot of what is for sale was duped, but that's ancillary to what I tried to say and old news. 
---
At the risk of sounding presumptuous, and if I'm being honest, yourself and the first replier sound to me like you've tapped deep into the black market to the point of boredom. It seems like you think god-level equipment is the only kind worth. If that's true, and others think that way, I'm alarmed.
---
I wish everyone who nukes would too. My goodness. I have seen 100 whitesprings nukes in the last week and one SBQ. 
---
VaultJoy
---
West Tek. You don't get the legendary drops like at Whitesprings, but you get way better loot from the Mutants. Also you can nuke Vault Tec. Again less legendaries but way more Glowing Ones.
---
The most annoying there is there will be 5 posts on the front page of the subreddit complaining about the same issue.
---
We don’t need 5 threads about the same issue within hours of each other.
---
I don’t think I would care this much. I’m level 110 so it’s not like I didn’t play at all. It’s crazy and not productive at all. If you really want the game to improve then quitting and plotting some sort of protest by deleting the game off your Computers is going to have the opposite effect. It’s Bethesda scraps this game I’m going to be pissed because it’s a missed opportunity. Sure it’s definitely been a rough start but the game has improve quit a bit and to pretend like it hasn’t is lie. 
---
Actually auto scrapping bulk items is something no player would want. Plastic can be hard enough to maintain if you make shotgun shells and have to do bulk items to make more cap space. This is a pretty big item and no your opinion don't mean jack when you don't know wtf you are trying to opine on. 
---
This dude thinks he’s hurting Bethesda by signing off, peace out l, ya toxic son of a snallygaster ✌️
---
It's funny, because I'm _pretty_ sure that people were complaining (before the hotfix) that you couldn't auto-scrap bulked items.
---
Lvl 200+ with multiple characters reporting in. 
---
If you're looking for the "typical" fallout experience you can have that up to "end game." It sounds like you ran into a 1 off person in your early travels. For the most part my early game (lvls 1-50) were mostly spent solo or with one other friend. There is plenty to discover and accomplish up to completion of exploring the whole map and exhausting the main story line. After that, its grinding legendary items and completing armor sets, etc.
---
The  latest rounds of nerfing turned the game back into constantly grinding for resources for me. I was having fun being what you would expect a lvl 200 character to be, an indestructible killing machine. Now, I'm just an indestructible guy who is constantly low on ammo. There is no content left for me to explore and I don't feel like spending half my time playing doing chores (grinding resources, repairing equipment, making ammo, collecting food, etc.) 
---
Bottom line, there is plenty of content until there is none left and all you have to do is grind resources.
---
Lol this subreddit, this game, and Bethesda are such a burning dumpster fire it's amazing to watch from afar. Posts like this keep me coming back here for the laughs. What a shitshow.
---
Worst gaming disaster ever!  By a long shot, bought this game with such excitement. Since about hour 2 I was suspicious about what exactly I was playing. I was playing a game that was half finished... if that. 
---
Love it or hate it, it obvious what everyone hates/loves about it. 
---
Much more hate.
---
When I spend $80 on a game i expect something playable. This wasn’t and hasn’t been playable since then. It’s been a huge let down that I can’t even trade away. 
---
#classactionlawsuit if I’ve ever saw one. 
---
#fuckbethesda
---
Fuck. Someone gets it. I easily drop 40~60 on a date w the wife for a few hours of leisure time. I've got +100 hours out of this game already. Worth.  
---
That was undone today
---
Well said. I’m pretty casual, I have enjoyed the game from the start, the server crashes suck but everything else has been good. Odd douche here and there but for the most part it’s been pretty rad 
---
I accidentally threw my best gun away but didn’t have a melt down over it. Jesus Christ.
---
You're the Bob Ross of FO. I could watch your videos all day
---
Bout to shelf my broken dragon gun and act like it's actually a rare legendary 
---
Oh shit, you are him
---
Im eating so much soup its replaced all the organs in my body.
---
Never owned a TSE, but I do own a double barrel explosive four shot. It was a god send before the updates. Sure it didnt mow down a sorchbeast in a couple of hits, but it did give me a fair fight. Now, i can't even solo one with its screechs at 1000 intervals a second. Honestly, this patch wasnt thought out well. More time should have put in to the process. 
---
&gt;within minutes
---
Well, I mean, I'm at 300 hours. If it completely broke tomorrow I'd still have more than received my money's worth. 
---
This way items aren’t simply dropped and rearranged, they’re saved directly in the camps budget. So other players can’t pick them up or take them either. The owner can though if they wanted to get them back by moving them to storage. We can finally put all those teddy bears on the bed
---
Oh, I saw that. I thought some had came in aND killed them.
---
Yeah, a family member was finding Heavy Combat Legs, but nothing else. Heavy Combat Armor plans have been my white whale.
---
Besides leather armor, I've not found a single other plan for a heavy armor with the exception of the torso I picked up today.
---
Was expecting some variation on 'Can I have your stuff?'. Was not disappointed.
---
I know you're probably exaggerating with "100" but I never see anyone nuke anything anymore! Seen about 5 max over the past week.
---
Where would you put them?
---
What's the process you're going through to change it? 
---
Are you sure the headlamp you have is compatible with the helmet?
---
Noticed a couple things since last 2 patchs. corpses disappear also instantly often. The turn to meat pile or disappear completely. 
---
Today clear 8 lvl 62+ SMutants at Herper ferry to go see the Vendor and only 3 created meat pile and only 1 corpse stuck around for more that 10 seconds.
---
Also I used to never get more that 1 or 2 diseases, not the second I am hit my a mob I instantly get 4. I guarantee that a few ninja nerfs happened the last couple weeks.
---
He can't find enough junk to fund his camp wall so he's quitting the game 
---
Not when I need the crap I am carrying, or when I have no caps left to get from vendors. 
---
You people? You mean the overwhelming majority of people who don’t like to get screwed over repeatedly by game developers?? 
---
It’s people like you that allow Todd howard to make millions by selling trash with the fallout label on it. 
---
You can suck Howard’s balls all you want but that doesn’t change the fact that the game you support can hardly be called a game at this point. 
---
The real reassurance is that people like you who allow yourselves to be cucked and have money taken out of your hand for an inferior product and thank them for it is a dying breed. 
---
Out of all of the great games available made by developers who actually care why choose a developer who clearly doesn’t give a shit about you? 
---
Fallout 76 has officially tanked. Stupidity is the only thing keeping it going, YOUR stupidity. 
---
Jesus Christ it's Jason Bourne 
---
 Holy shit, it is a survival game, there should be limits to how much a player can carry.  It may not be hardcore survival, but FFS.
---
It’s beeb reported multiple time, yet nothing
---
Yea a little bit, but geez where is the variety. I'm a high level, so I like fighting the queen and getting gear from her. I literally don't even participate in the nuked whitesprings anymore. I'm so burnt out of the trash loot there. 
---
Are you trying to install one of the bugged ATOM Shop lamps? Because they can't be installed unless you've bought them, which obviously you can't.
---
Robobrains _do_ drop them tho, unless beth patched that.
---
I got Buttressed arms, legs, and torso from scrapping before the patch. It's hard to unlock, scrapped hundreds of parts to get it.
---
Why wont they just buy it themself, you can prob geti it pretty cheap
---
Why? What did your friend do to you?
---
This thread makes me loss all hope for Bethesda. I refuse to buy their game from this point onward.
---
Plus you get the best experince when you grow your character yourself
---
I got BOS arms and legs from Grafton over two days. then for the whole week before the patch no BOS chest. And after the patch no BOS but I did find Heavy Combat Chest at Grafton- which has almost identical stats to BOS in it’s lowest level.
---
Yeah something like that 
---
Watoga government bots.  Make a loop, kill them all, lvl 50's give 84 xp.  1 out of 10 or so will be legendary, 1 of 10 of those might be a 3 star.  Check the vendors in Watoga for legendaries other people sold.  Also very repetitive, but an easy way to farm legendaries, some xp and the vendors.  You can also grab stimpacks from the mayors office if you're in need, they reset every new server.
---
&gt; Can we not just continue to fix the game and maybe give Bethesda a little bit of credit for releasing patches in a timely manner?
---
I mean they literally just released a patch riddled with bugs, then a hotfix for those bugs containing another bug.  And you're praising them for this service?  Ignoring the complaints about nerfs, people have reason to complain bgs isn't exactly giving their best.
---
Still love the game
---
I want my clearly 8 bed house to sleep more than 4 people
---
You spelled "technological terror" incorrectly.
---
Not at vendors. Only worlds spawns and Patrol Duty.
---
Truer words have never been spoken!
---
this works! I just wish they organized the armor like the weapons haha
---
Lmfao. You were out like a fucking rabbit. Those of us who don't jump that high use our points in stealth ranged and aaarrrmmmooooorrrrrr!!!! Whiteknight for the win 
---
Damn, I understand how his posts could be annoying but you guys are kind of harsh 😂
---
Microsoft and Sony do not give out that information. Game companies can only see what happens on the server end. Microsoft and Sony are super tight about their client data. 
---
Almost all those quitting post to say "I used to defend the game". That means the person making that post was emotionally invested in the game in a positive way. 
---
Once you alienate someone enough where they flip from being emotionally invested in a positive way, I very rarely have seen it into neutral manner. As I've seen, Normally a person develops a very negative attitude towards something once they flip from being positively invested into it to being frustrated enough with it.
---
It doesn't help that Bethedsa won't even make an open letter to the community, or even apologize for any mistakes they've made.
---
You got upvoted by Hollywood Regisseur Michael Bay 
---
If there is more than one person offering them, please let me know as I would also love to buy them. Either as a mod or the plans. Many thanks
---
Wow! That is awesome.  I take it. That it can only be done on near flat lands I take it 
---
I wish they would just make that item a regular outfit so I could wear it without losing my underarmor.  As it is, you have to nerf yourself to enjoy it.
---
Hey I nuked Lewistown. Shitload of gouls and decent drops as well as the irradiated flora 
---
I mean I don’t agree at all. I think people are acting pretty childish to pretend like the game hasn’t been improving and that the patches haven’t been coming out at an epic pace. Bethesda did fuck up though. They should have waited to release it or released it in as early access but what’s done is done. I certainly don’t want them to stop trying to improve the game. I like the concept and I think it can be an amazing game if people are patient and don’t throw temper tantrums.
---
Bought 3 things from the store: duster, rustic stash, black pop boy. All with atoms earned in-game. Not much else appeals to me, most of it’s too flashy. Wish they’d add more options in the vein of the duster.
---
And I want to be top bunk but the game has forsaken me with no joy 
---
Yeah wow my bad I thought they weighed less in the beganing at least, but I guess not, it adds .08 with bulk steel wtf will either way bulk shouldn't be auto scrapped lol
---
We must band together to make that top bunk usable 
---
I mean... I haven't done that either... 😅
---
A dissertation, that's the good stuff 
---
I've got it on Xbox if youd like, gt: problemchildscc
---
Thanks for the tip brothair loops to you. 
---
I had no idea that was a thing. I wonder if that is intentional. Thanks for the info.
---
Man, seriously my eyes lit up when I saw the your username! I watched all your videos back then and recreated your structures the best I could. You’re just THE settlement building genius! There’s norespawns or cordless, which are also great builder, but your innovative way of finding such things like in the video, it’s simply amazing! Your video are also very calming, like asmr videos haha. Anyways, keep it up, nice seeing you again! 
---
There are fish in the streams.   I've seen them during Submarine powerarmor strolls.
---
And always have extra beds cause everyone wants top bunk!
---
That is good to read, I already felt abnormal by being only lvl 38 since launch. Of all games I am playing, Fo76 I actually played exceptionally much. I already have around 80 hours and my most played game on steam has 120 hours but that I play for 2 years.
---
I don't get it, why I should rush things, I rather enjoy it and have some lasting fun with the game.
---
Regarding bugs, I don't really encountered many. The A.I. is bugged from times, I sometimes had server disconnects. And the game crashes if I detonate 10 cars in front of Sugar Grove, but that could be me running the game on Linux. 
---
I respect this, and at the knowledge that I will be downvoted for posting my opinion in a post against it, if people let up in Bethesda then that’s when they stop listening. We don’t really have any way to show how we feel about the game aside from this reddit. There is no way to review bomb it or it would’ve been done by now. This is the community’s way of saying they’re mad and they won’t stop until they’ve worn themselves out. If Bethesda makes another slip up in that time the entire community will start from scratch again. It’s a shit show yes but it’ll blow over eventually. It’s life. It’s outside of our control
---
I can say the same thing about this specific response...instead you choose to support the “do anything anywhere with any build without sacrificing anything” type of play style 
---
 Learn to play without Power Armor?  
---
I know for sure dirty greaser jacket and jeans can be found in game, location: top floor of building at end of alley with Harper's ferry vendor
---
I haven't even been to look at the SBQ. Fucking hate scorchbeasts so much I can't be arsed going to fight the end boss haha saving that for the very last thing I have to do. I'd rather collect lead haha
---
Oh god youre a hybrid. You are also the kind to write an essay on how a person (you've never seen before) is wrong. Jesus Christ man, where's your dignity. You even privately messaged me to send a pic of myself. Get a grip. It's a game. Let people who enjoy it continue to enjoy it 
---
yeah, this has been the same for me. My Fortune finder keeps finding all these empty cap stashes and when I do find some that has caps, it is a hit or miss if my Cap Collector perk kicks in to get the extra.  First off it is misleading that my fortune finder goes off on empty stashes, and according to the Cap Collector Card, I find extra in ALL stashes.  I guess they just Nerfed the hell out of it.
---
Seems really similar to what the bfv subreddit needs to understand
---
I like that look
---
Funny, I manage to find people to PvP with everyday. Plenty of us out PvPing. Its pretty rare that i enter a server and no one has a workshop claimed. Takes 2 minutes to locate a PvP eligable player and engage. 
---
See Owned workshop&gt; Find Owner on map&gt; tag workshop&gt; fast travel to Owner&gt; kill him. Then a pvp back and forth begins.  Or ill see someone on a bench they own. Or ill grab a bounty and go to wherever people are - whitesprings station or watoga. Or ill spot player at camps, go smash 1 wall at their camp. Taunt. Repeat. Taunt.
---
Or just orbital strike some fool whose sitting in their base. That usually start a good fight. 
---
PvP is all over this game. I dont know what your talking about. 
---
Ah yes top bunk, the true holy interpretation of bed heaven 
---
Dude, the main stuff was about balancing the damage of the TSE, nothing to do with realism, they also removed explosive bullets from the weapons that don't fire bullets, but that's actually a bug fix.
---
Fucken traveling. It's so god damn expensive for me to do a daily scavenge run I have taken to moving to the south west side of the map just to reap the benefits of being somewhat near difficult spawns
---
if the items are obtained legally without duping or glitches and you are NOT using any 3rd party programs to automate(bot) the process and you are only using in game intended mechanics to obtain those mats you are perfectly in the clear to trade those items to others.
---
Provided you are not exchanging them for RL currency, items, ~~sex~~ etc.
---
Until the dupe situation is finally done with for safety reasons I would keep the stockpile reasonable.  most mats and ammo under 1000 with more heavy weapon ammo being ok.
---
If you suddenly have 100k of every mat, ammo type and aids...you may get looked at.
---
What platform?
---
Xbox one, GT is Evora xL
---
Fallout 76 is fucking hot trash at this point Bethesda plox fix your shit I actually used to like you and thought you were semi competent as a developer. 
---
Top bunk for all!
---
Dude shut up
---
Im on playstation
---
✊
---
Hotfix and made new bugs? I’m not experiencing this shit. I think it’s 100% about the god damn weapons and has nothing to do with any new bugs that probably don’t effect 99% of the people who play it. I think they are using that as an excuse to fucking bitch. Quit whatever though fuck it but it’s not going to stop me from giving credit where credit is due and pray that whatever hardcore players quit because of this BS aren’t enough to really effect the development of the god damn game that i want Bethesda to build. 
---
How did you reach INT 51?
---
Let’s assume you chose to have 15 natural INT, and then it’s +15 for the 5 unyielding armors, right?, then +6 for egg head mutation, then +4 for drugs, +2 for food, and +2 for shielded vault suit, but that only goes up to 44.  I guess possibly add a few +1s from seconary legendary armor effects.
---
It’s gotta be the hat...
---
BTW, when hacking terminals do you only get one word to choose from? :)
---
They did a bit ago. 
---
Was incorrectly using the  sentry bot drop table.
---
And just to let you know, I have barely any problems with the game, I've barely crashed, barely glitched and haven't run into toxic people. This game seems just as good as any other game to me because I'm just lucky. So don't tell me I'm wrong for liking a game ( your basically saying an opinion is wrong and I'm not sure if you sent to school but you can't call an opinion wrong)
---
Damn so close
---
I’m interested in the plans as well, if anyone has duplicates.
---
This is the most in-Toxic vent I’ve ever seen on here, keep up the good fight...I know Its frustrating sometimes, thanks for not being a total Dbag about it 
---
Thank you for your patronage resident.
---
If they removed bottom bunk function for top bunk function while working on dual function I'd be content.
---
Did you find the plans for the Heavy Combat Chest or a mod for it?
---
Wait there are people still playijg? With the number of I quit posts figured no one was on anymore 
---
Oh, didn't know that. Haven't really gone out of my way to kill any robos in a while.
---
The people in this sub are nowhere near the majority of the player base btw. 
---
It doesn't and just relized cuz I'm looking at it right now but most weight more, around .03 to at least .08 wow this whole time I thought all the bulk Weight less smh lol
---
Well... Considering I have loaded thousands of hours into most of the fallout titles, I am a bit dissappointed in this one. And chances are, when they release the ability to mod on your own game instance, I will be playing again
---
It’s not the lack of DLC to keep this post simple, Bethesda is out of touch with their game.
---
The don’t know how to please the masses (nerfing the wrong things like white knight  and not buffing things like energy weapons)
---
The patch that just happened was some amateur hour mess. Nobody cares about Bobby pin weight, they care that something as simple as Bobby pin weight keeps getting fucked up. If I can’t trust someone to make a sandwich I sure don’t expect them to make me a good steak.
---
Beth messes up simple things and people are tired of it.
---
Beth has teased new content, but there’s no follow up on any of it. No road map or anything no one expects new content, but we would like an idea of when to expect it.
---
Lastly Beth focusing on bugs is great but if they want to get the game 100% bug free before adding content, we won’t get content. People are just fed up honestly. It’s not 1 or 2 issues is a culmination.  
---
Hope that answers your question and I hope I explained it accurately 
---
You do realize 171,000 is about 10% of total sales before you even look at how many people still play right? That’s a substantial chunk. 
---
It's pretty fun. She is 3 times the size as the others. Plus you have to kill all her minions and they can be all varieties of creatures attacking you. Whitesprings has one type, and it's the ghouls. The rewards from the queen and vicinity are much better than what you get at whitesprings too.
---
The coals of virginity are burning hot tonight boys. 
---
Did I trigger you? 
---
Opinions are wrong everyday and yours happens to be one. 
---
Not only is it wrong, but you saying such profoundly stupid things on the internet really shows why gaming in 2018-19 is in a dark place. 
---
Nah man it's for vendor selling purposes and that's really it 
---
Because everybody loves bullet sponges. That's why people make  FO4 mods to  make enemies even *more* spongier, obviously.
---
Is the lmg a heavy weapon?
---
Sorry but you took a massive L on this one my dude 
---
Yep same. Then I got a disease which increased hunger and couldn't keep up with it!

With some of the horror stories that have been circulating the last few days, I wouldn't risk it.

ESO actually had a storyline. It wasn't an asset flip. Stop comparing 76 to ESO.

May be an unintentional side-effect of a fix intended to make rad worms actually give +50% radiation damage. Instead it gives +50% to all effects instead if just radiation damage. Enjoy it while it lasts. We'll all be diseased until it is fixed... Rad Worm epidemic! Call the Responders!
---
I thought I was proud of my box but.. nah I wanna live here.

3 times the size! OK I have to see that, just thought it would be the same as all the others. Probably shit myself and run away but I'll definitely go take a look.
---
Has anyone seen the bathtub plan?

You think we'll ever find a "normal" vault or we'll be stuck in this horrible experiment forever?

Lol the balls of this guy suggesting BS games to pile more shit on top of the mound. Dude, it's only going to cause more server crashes. 
---
I'll say it again, where is your dignity? Lost in all your life's failures?
---
This needs more upvotes
---
Doesn’t mean squat. I’ve had totally flat clear areas and I can’t build my structure. Either it’s floating or “nothing is selected”. Haven’t been able to place my camp structure for at least 2 weeks. Getting sick of this.
---
On XB1
---
And reformats your hard drive.
---
You aren't experiencing it so every one must be mad about tse nerf? The game is a buggy mess and you ate delusional.
---
&gt; This sub is super toxic and whiny. 
---
And the people on this sub are the only ones who seemed to give it a fair shake too. I mean Bethesda has kind of really messed up if they're pissing off the only group that doesn't automatically downvote people saying "sure it's buggy but it's still fun".
---
‘People who care about Fallout franchise care about how Fallout franchise is handled’
---
OH MY STARS AND GARTERS
---
Yeah ive enjoyed the game and maybe the next guy probably has not but in my defense, when people say certain bugs were added back into the game that actually were not and slandering the game, others see the comment and take it as fact. The recent patch did introduce a few old bugs but there's no proof whatsoever that some of the game breaking bugs from before has made it back. I do understand where you come from, but I will defend the game if untruthful comments are made or if not proven theories are being told. :)
---
I am a casual. I am level 39 and have put about 50 hours into this game, despite having played it since BETA. With that said, I don't need to have found a TSE gun or reached the end game to be offended by the lack of effort or planning Bethesda has put into this game.
---
I doubt your theory about a "broad audience." I suspect that this game has very few casual players, as the game for the most part lacks the content or functionality to draw in players. I believe that it has drawn in players as a result of brand loyalty and connection to the previous Fallout games, not the merits of the game itself, and so a very significant amount of players are serious gamers. I can tell you that I am only an exception to that rule because of changing life circumstances that coincided with the game (new job and new girlfriend) and because the game has been so uninspiring that I have not had the motivation to return to it frequently.
---
I think the extent to which your theory is true is that they sought a broad audience at launch, for the purpose of turning a dollar, but it's silly to defend their updates since launch as simply favoring a broad audience over a narrow hardcore audience. This conceptualization simply cloaks the fact that they have done a shitty job tailoring this game to any audience.
---
I've had amazing experiences with PS4. Amazing community I've had barely any glitches ( though it could be just luck)
---
Omg tots coming over soon.
---
Todd's in white springs. Notice all those bodies in dumpsters, those were the BGS employees who had a conscience. 
---
I'm nowhere near that, but I'd rather wait for the official word, or better yet, set the boundaries within the fucking game so we don't have to worry/guess at this shit.
---
Seems to be a recon scope issue in general, or at least the short scope. My .44 revolver recon scope has the same behavior
---
For a more pleasant fallout community, I would highly suggest r/fo76filthycasuals. They are the ones enjoying the game and understand that not every single problem will be fixed by next patch. It’s a good place to see the love the game gets.
---
The difference is Bethesda is a *massive* company in terms of reputation. Their launches shouldn't look like this game's.
---
That is almost every post on this /r so the question is, if it upsets you why come here?
---
THANK YOU
---
50.55 GB
---
they are both similar in that you're putting the responsibility of upholding jus cogens toward the vendor and not yourself. it's a very low bar to set for yourself where you make others responsible.
---
also, we're specifically talking about exploits - a part of glitches - which is abusing glitches knowingly. the knowingly part is important. to say "no one saw me do it, so i did it, which means its ok" is an obvious logical fallacy. you are not allowed to exploit. you are not allowed to dupe. similarly, you are not allowed to steal things from a store. just because you can doesn't mean it's lawful.
---
ergo, saying "it's their fault" is a petty show of character. no offense. you shouldn't murder people because someone said you shouldn't, or because there's a law that would punish you; you don't murder people because it's not right.
---
saying "well, if i could, i don't see why i shouldn't. the onus doesn't lie on me" really speaks more to your sense of justice than it does about anything else. i mean, can't you think for yourself? or are you a psychopath that will enjoy any number of liberties, despite how it's harmful to others, if no one is going to catch you?
---
I’m using ultracite so I don’t I’ll be picking that up
---
Then they should allow us to build polawksi preservation shelters that work.
---
In this game more damage effectively IS armor piercing. 
---
I'm level 79 as of now and honestly I'm just completely void of all bugs, it will have to literally be 100% chance for me to see it since I'm just never around to experience it, which sucks cause I also miss out on the fun bugs 
---
Yep.  Honestly, I'm not even trying to prove a point to Bethesda by not spending my free Atoms.  Now if there were some Excavator PA paint in there...
---
Yup. Lost the plastic.
---
Toddus you mean?
---
2 molded plastic .01 each 10 raw rubber at .01 each bulk weights .013...... It adds .01 wtf where does the extra .01 come from??
---
But I'm feeling entitled and want to complain. I'm not sure if I've complained enough about everything, so I was complaining about complaining when I realised that they haven't released all new content in 76 days. I mean what do Bethesda workers do all day?
---
Unless it can obliterate a sentry bot with ease I'm not touching it 
---
Haha! Yes now I will def be looking for a few ghoul smacks to start my day. Rad worms here I come! Haha, I have never seen anyone post about this before. Had no clue.
---
I’m using it only to collect a ton of trash to give to vendors for caps. Then what will I fill those with once I’m done?
---
Lazy boring post - play the game.  Move on if you don’t like it. 
---
It was a modest visual improvement, but they also got to play it at a better framerate and resolution. PS3 users had the save bugs and both consoles played skyrim piss poor. Also they got mods now too.  
---
So, to try and answer your question from the dark side, XBox checking in...aside from the server boots (which were awful at first, not gonna lie) every single patch and hot fix since then has gotten better and better. I think this is definitely a console game. I even listen to podcasts out there, and the majority play computer, with issue I’ve never seen or even heard of
---
Wait what? 
---
You can google her or watch youtube videos if you want to spoil it.
---
modders would honestly have the game fixed by now
---
just saying
---
Bethesda has stuck with trying to improve the game, they have spent money to try to right the ship. They gave every player regardless if they purchased the game access to the classic fallout collection, they put out patches, big fucking patches at a lightning pace which have dramatically improve the game, they have free DLCs coming out this month, not only pvp servers but also team activities in the vaults and they’ve done all of this to a chorus of boos while assholes like Forbes predicted they wouldn’t do shit and would just trash it making it free to play. Then they have to read post accusing them of having interns developing the game and how they don’t give a shit about the community.  I mean fuck what the fuck do you expect to be the fucking outcome by acting like poisonous entitled babies over a fucking weapons nerf. Fucking hate me, everyone can fucking hate me, I don’t get a fucking shit but it’s going to fucking suck if they don’t finish the fucking game because of a god damn mother fucking weapons nerf.
---
Dont ask me man I still wonder myself 
---
Yes I do, in all it gives me +60% melee damage, or with my All Rise at 200%, about the same power of a lvl 30 fat man
---
On PS4 haven't had any issue sence the power armor bug. Love this game. I don't get why people hate on a game so much. 
---
This is untrue, the forums that were deleted were not deleted by bethesda staff and those that were deleted were deleted because they had slanderous messages and extreme foul language. The slanderous messages was the patron spouting false claims about certain bugs that were tested and not actually added back into the game and the patron was infact trying to get publicity. If there are flaws I would point out all of the bugs that are proven to be in the game, but if slanderous comments about bugs being introduced that are untrue and proven to be untrue and harassing staff I will stand up for staff. It just annoys me when people see a comment and take it as fact when in reality you haven't encountered the bug yourself. I hope you can see where im coming from. :)
---
If they’re just clipping, you should still be able to hear flies once they decompose, right?
---
omgosh, I thought I was crazy. I lost of ton of bulk things today and I am not amused. Steel and acid.
---
While I agree with most of your points, I think the reason fallout 76 is still alive is because of hardcore fallout fans that loves at least some (if not more)  aspects of the fallout 76. So, you are selling them a little short. Valuable feedback provided by hardcore players (be it in form of rage sometimes for better or worse) has potential to bring many more casual players back who have left because of poor launch.  
---
Welcome to Reddit
---
It is. I’ve had reasonable, but not good, luck with the glitches. SBQ becomes invincible occasionally, a frequent teammate disconnects almost constantly, delayed loading of textures or enemies, etc.  I’ve had several crashes too, a few shortly after launching a nuke solo. 
---
That.   
---
Take my upvote.  
---
By the way, there are those of us here who are not casuals, do the crazy shit, are not whining, and still totally agree with everything you said. [I definitely do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aljcj6/good_stuff_that_happened_in_this_patch/)  
---
SBQ poofed with spinning circle.  Probably ultracite vents anyway...
---
Thanks i fixed it i was just being stupid. I should have know better, thanks! :)
---
Sweet, a post bitching about posts bitching about posts.
---
Thanks Bethesda.
---
I don't stream myself but happily watch others play games, and I can still get into the craze I just get to take a backseat to playing it myself. 
---
Lol it's like when Becky says she's leaving Facebook because she's HAD ENOUGH then posts the vegan meatballs she makes for dinner. 
---
Oh, I’m doing a power armored two handed melee build so i don’t think that’ll be good for me, although now that I think about it, and though it’ll take a lot of time, unyielding marine armor does sound good.
---
That's been happening to me for a while now, I don't think the hotfix caused this
---
I am a huge fallout fan but I’m so glad I didn’t buy this game. I waited to see the reviews and from day one they have never gotten better. I have been burned enough times pre ordering so now at $80+ a game I just wait, I wait for good reviews and then I wait for the game to go on sale a few months later.
---
Not everyone should buy a plan. Only them who run crafting service
---
I have no clue what you're talking about I've seen a dude walk up to an SBQ and one shot it like nothing and I swear it was the fastest run ive done, might have been a glitch but it sure was great 
---
Dear Bethesda, your game needs a full reboot. 
---
I did the same but found no solution for the Problem... I think we both wasted a Level 
---
How is anyone still trying to play this dumpster fire game?
---
You'll find a two shot gun and think "Sweet."
---
You'll find an explosive gun and think "Sweet."
---
(And then you'll blow yourself up a lot.)
---
But then, you'll come across a two-shot explosive gun and think "Sweeeet." And you'll be happy because it is more powerful than your other two guns, most likely.
---
(And you'll blow yourself up a lot.) 
---
Same I smelled this turd from a mile away before launch. Just knew their shitty engine couldn’t do multiplayer since it’s been struggling to do singleplayer since oblivion, literally 10+ years. 
---
I come by here everytime I hear how horrible Bethesda is treating the player base. It’s amazing to me I’ve made like 4 trips here because they keep fucking up so bad it reaches someone like me who isn’t even looking for this stuff. Like so bad I already decided to never buy one of their games again like 3 disasters ago. At this point the banning is a hilarious culling of their most die hard supporters. The people who are really grinding, amazing Bethesda is fucking their whales over. That’s unprecedented in modern gaming
---
You guys are all masochists. There is no way this game is that good to keep playing. But I do get a lot of schadenfreude reading these threads so god bless you boys. 
---
Have been playing on Xbox since beta with no big issues except a couple of disconnects . Really enjoy this game .. so your not alone.
---
Damn that sucks 
---
T-51b Red Headlamp mod, trying to install on the power armor station. Ive done it for all my other power armor
---
damn wish that guy was on my server would have been less painful
---
a what?
---
nope, when it hapoened to me in the bunker one was behind the gate with the vendor modus in the military wing. When it happened somewhere when i had scorced i got paranoid thinking someone was following me around with some sort of constant stealth exploit or something.
---
I pressed play and got onto refit to browse for a min..... 25 mins later, still on load screen
---
I encountered it tonight,  all enemies began to regenerate all their health and were invincible to everything except grenades and melee. Wasn't related to an explosive weapon in my case, just a bog standard automatic assault rifle. I started playing 76 after this was ostensibly fixed, first time encountering it tonight, so it might be back?
---
What, Captain Hollister?
---
Agree! Im on original Ps4 and had hardly any trouble. Only real problem is framerate issues when fighting SBQ with multiple players. Only had 2 griefing problems since beta. Everyone i meet in game has been great.
---
I really don't sell my bulk with the 200 cap limit with each vendor by selling all of the drugs and weapons I don't use or need, the caps are gone and I end up spending more money because I buy whatever I need it or want sometimes just to empty out my inventory
---
&gt; I like scrounging and building new camps.
---
Once you're done with Fo76, grab a few friends and check out 7D2D. When it comes to building and scrounging it's the best survival sandbox I know. Should be 5 bucks or something like that.
---
Well I hope you find him because running two SBQ in a single day is probably the most satisfying thing 
---
REALLY. See, when I asked for a refund, I got [this email in response](https://i.imgur.com/H7MakKj.png)
---
Fucking outstanding.
---
I thought the carry weight/stash limit was boosted to 1500 lbs. My stash is still 600 lbs.  Wtf?
---
It has plenty of faults but I enjoy it more than not. Most probably wouldn't agree but I feel I've gotten moneys worth.
---
Lol 
---
Nah, as you say it will spoil the surprise.
---
agree 
---
smaller, more constant updates 
---
test bigger fixes first please
---
You've got a clog. Gonna be around 800 caps just gettin' 'er looked at.
---
This sounds amazing, will definitely try. Thanks! 
---
How did he fit so much tho 
---
Unique bosses at different nuke sites would make the game much more interesting. Imagine a 15 ft irradiated mothman 
---
Hey I'm not here to argue the morality of duping. But if you're gonna break the TOS don't be a little bitch about it and come whining about how the ban stick isn't fair.  
---
Also as you're clearly in fear of every activity in this game as you suggest you might want to write a letter to BGS and thank them for a successful survival game. 
---
You know, I was carrying too much hand projectiles. 
---
There ARE NO "beta" or "pre-release" concepts in a game that continues core development post-launch.   
---
Quit the "but I want the square to be a triangle" yammering. It isn't a triangle, and this isn't a waterfall-release game. It ships early, and it lets **us** inform and steer the core game design as it goes along.   
---
Remember, **nobody** invited you to contribute to Fallout 4's design before it was closed off and cast in stone.   
---
Fallout 76 offers us this. Pull your head out and value it.  
---
They made items protected from “scrap all” unable to be auto-scrapped. This unfortunately included bulk packs so  they fixed the bulk issue by making bulk packs affected by “scrap all”.  That just seems lazy AF, but not unexpected.
---
I've heard about west tek, I should give this a try too. Thinks! 
---
That’s what she said 
---
Why are you like this 
---
What the game could have been without a stupid budget.
---
TSE shotguns pre-patch dealt an absurd amount of damage. The Queen is heavily armored and the double shotgun doesn't come with armor piercing options so it's not optimal to begin with. Try a .50 cal ... prime it if you can be bothered with the violet flux.
---
Let me get your Weapons whenever your done crying 
---
So that means you'll be back complaining on Friday after work?
---
How the hell do they have so much budget? I add a light in and it takes up a third of my budget. 
---
I agree.  I too would like to clean up my PERK cards that are duplicate.  
---
Hell, while we are at it can we also clean up the Misc tab under the pip-boy?  I mean seriously do I need to keep the 3 sets of keys for Morgantown High School principle’s office at level 100 anymore? 
---
damn any proof? like a link or a pic? 
---
I knew this had to be a one-liner if it made it to front page among the downvote brigade
---
I do the same. The only chems I ever really use are stimpaks and radaways. I don't even really use rad-xbut I keep em in case a friend needs. Everything else, sold. I don't keep much extraneous junk either so bulking is useful for me
---
When she becomes "invincible" I've noticed it's just a lag issue.. the last two patches really cleared that up for me. If you need someone to play with let me know! Most of my friends have been feeling burnt out, but this game is a social thing for me.. I would love to fuck her up since the last patch!
---
Pre Patch C.A.M.P glitch
---
Can I have your account?
---
Same for for me with a long recon scope.
---
hmm ill try it!
---
&gt; FO76 is in no way behind schedule for content update compared to the previous game. 
---
You can't compare FO4 with FO76. FO4 has much more content than FO76. When FO76 was released, it already was lacking in terms of endgame content. FO76 was planned to play on and on.
---
171.000 people are not a minority. There are probably less than 1 mil people actively playing the game, by right now.
---
I just got FO76 and have been enjoying it over the last two weeks, coming upto 24 hours in game time and I'm level 17. 
---
I'm subbed here because I like to be subbed to games that interest me and if I don't know something I can google/Reddit it. 
---
Also my two friends have the game after seeing me play (level 6 and level 14 friends now) and one of them is also subbed here. :) 
---
A big change to the story to make it single-player-ish is too much to ask.  But is “offline” mode too much to ask or incompatible with Bethesda’s vision?
---
I guess the big question is whether “offline mode” is the same as “private server with mods”.  OP wants to be able to set the difficulty level or be able to make bobby pins weigh 5 pounds, so maybe close enough.
---
&gt;	https://www.vgr.com/private-servers-mod-support-fallout/ As Pete Hines reiterates, modding is certainly a priority for Bethesda. However, to prevent mods from intruding into the servers of other players, mod support will only be available in private servers; “Mod support is going to be tied to work that we’re also doing on private servers,” says Hines; “and letting people do private servers. Mods will be a thing that run on private servers.”
---
So, what I see is asking Bethesda to do something that already was their eventual vision, but please actually make it happen and make it a priority.
---
...and rage quit publicly only to lurk for half a minute, to repeat the cycle again.
---
I feel your comparison to fallout 4 regarding new content is unfair. You are comparing a fully singleplayer game with tons of quests, interesting locations and npcs (who actually tell stories) to a multiplayer game that lacks some if not a lot of these aspects. Multiplayer games live and die by their content, if there is nothing to do people will stop playing. Because of this the schedule for new content should be much accelerated compared to F4, in my opinion
---
Have you not seen the front page of this sub laitly? I've seen more "I got banned for crafting" posts in the past 24 hours in this sub alone than I think I've collectively seen in every other game thread I sub too
---
Don't cheat.
---
Wjmc89, I've been playing since launch and still loving it. It's just about the only game I play now, that being ever since launch. If there's a bug, meh, move around it and carry on. Like someone here said, just play it. And if you enjoy it, then that's that. Don't let anyone else tell you whether you will or can enjoy a game that they don't. 
---
That attitude will make sure we get more games artificially extended by adding grind.
---
That's what I kinda figured too.. didn't see xbox people talking about how "broken the game is"..
---
I'm glad to see that consoles were the better option for once! PC "master race" would usually try to make us feel inferior!
---
I mean, I'm a computer guy, I just don't like issues unless I'm getting paid to fix them 😋
---
The dark side can stand together with.. us. Lol. Moments like this I wish cross play was a thing.
---
It’s a game. I get that there are fond memories, but the same thing happened with new Vegas.  No company can make a better IP when the emotional attachment to something is stronger than the actual thing. I see this same thing happening to Star Wars. The emotional attachment when someone was younger is far more intrinsic to the IP than the actual quality. I think folks need to go outside once in awhile.
---
Problem with online game audiences is that lots of them are kids, and not only are they not statistically trained, they actually think that the youtubosphere \*\*is actually everyone\*\*.   
---
Had several pointless arguments with such people recently, who were absolutely hell bent convinced that media = everybody. 
---
Lol I forgot that
---
Yeah lol so realisticly as dumb as it sounds unless less than 2000 people play we are l not the majority. I would say we are the loudest, clearest source of response, useful or not. (Mostly not)
---
Can You be my lover?
---
That whole intro bit had me thinking this was satire while I was reading it
---
You said it, I wish Sony would stop being dicks on all of this...after I’m done with 76, I think I’m switching to Sony...they win lol 
---
Or, just remove bulk entirely and let us sell everything to the merchant.  Mult to one if needed to equalize value.
---
There was a glitch where camp items duped while in storage after a move. Do it enough times and they keep adding up. Because they’re in storage, already made, they could be placed but nothing else could until you were under 100% budget. 
---
It would be great, if they actually did depart. But it's a public post and they need to see people crying over the 'loss to the community' that they deem themselves to be.
---
I found that for the second time today (xbox) and dropped it a train station. If I had waited...hell, 10 more minutes, I'd have seen your message.
---
I think i got for the mistress of mystery quest line
---
It started with the January 29th patch only. 
---
This new patch added from what i could tell only 3 bugs and fixed about 40 and i haven't had a crash or dc yet.
---
If I have two characters and grind for resources with both, is it against the terms of service to trade loot between the characters?
---
Both characters are levelling up, playing the game within the boundaries and have a mutual friend they trade with.
---
This is a hypothetical, but also a clarification regarding the terms and conditions of playing the game.
---
&gt; My two shot plasma rifle went from 66 to 33 damage.
---
No it didn't. 
---
I'm a casual (Lv. 84). The house I'd just finished building over the three days leading up to the patch disappeared after server crash. I don't have time or desire to do it again right now, especially if it could just happen again. Additionally, they made significant downgrades to things I spent weeks working toward.  Altering my build means more weeks of moving SPECIALs around and picking up new perks. I'm pissed, and i have a right to be. 
---
The law is don't attempt to exploit, don't co-star in YouTube videos with people who exploit, don't get caught paying real money for items, don't have a character who is ridiculously overweight (like 50k pounds, not really an issue anymore), and don't craft shit absurdly fast.  No one cares about where you get resources or how many mule alts you have.  Shit's on fire right now man they ain't got time to worry about you passing screws to your second character, not that they would care anyway.
---
You must be paid by Bethesda, that's at least what I've been told today. This game is hopelessly "broken". Glad I'm not the only one who feels this isn't true!
---
Ohhhh I had this. But I just scrapped all of the items I didn't need. 
---
You mean, the unplayable monstrosity that they played for 2000 hrs?
---
&gt;free
---
Yeah. ;)
---
that's a good shill
---
Just make mods completely unscrappable.  You can only use or sell.
---
Definitely. With all of the changes to perks they need to give the option to respec. 
---
I understand why people are upset. I'm just tired of reading these self righteous monuments to entitlement that you all write about the same damn thing ad nauseam.
---
I get it. You don't want to have to put any work into the game, or any effort into a proper spec. You want to equip an OP weapon, and win in ezmode. Everything else you said is just fluff that basically boils down to this. 
---
I can't afford to take the chance. We need an official statement, not conjecture.
---
OMG!
---
As long as they are not duped items then this is perfectly safe. I honestly don't believe any of these false ban posts. Just people trying to get karma and create drama or get unbanned even though they really did cheat.
---
Aren't you an angry elf?
---
Never suggested we were the majority, I'm saying we are a statistically significant minority, large enough to not just be brushed off.
---
No clue, all we've really seen is people who are crafting items repeatedly for necessary parts are getting banned for 'duping' even for legitimate crafting and nobody has any idea what the crafting limits are set at 
---
Right because duping is totally an actual crime... I don't play fo76 because it's a trainwreck with economy crippling glitches. If Bethesda wants me to pay for their game I expect it to not be hopelessly broken.
---
I’ll watch the video, but when Insta points when they used the best Vault Girl of all time 👌😍
---
Set the computer in overdrive and melt the processors 
---
Instigating is a terrible roll for a Gatling gun.
---
I feel bad for you.
---
And agree, except I don't think they are listening 
---
Im loving it. Go to R/fo76filthycasuals for a completely different view.
---
What attitude? Enjoying a game? Should I not do something that I enjoy because some random person that means nothing to me doesn't like it? What kind of logic is that exactly?
---
I also use Gatling plasma from time-to-time, and it is the fastest breaking weapon in the game, in my experience. 
---
It's good to hear that it's not just PlayStation. I think it's a lot easier to design for an architecture that is predictable- Xbox and Sony only have a few different models out there.
---
Now how do we get paid to talk shill about the game? Because the PC people seem to think it's impossible to play this game.. you know, master race and all..
---
Probably bobble stacking. It was most common with explosive bobbles but apparently worked (and may still work) with others that don’t boost SPECIAL. 
---
The default response to "I'm leaving!!!!!" should be "Can I have your stuff?"
---
This was already making the game lag, I can't imagine if everyones camp was like this.
---
Hahaha you got me lol
---
I’ve been rocking that for a while now. It’s pretty nice 👌
---
All the positive people left and went to filthy casuals to get away from -56vote for saying something positive or defending them. At 1 point i had -106 for saying i enjoyed the game and my ps4 classic isn't crashing.
---
Goodbye. Please give me your caps. Also your post history is shit.
---
And there are a bunch of people saying don't worry, it's all good. I can't afford to have my account banned, especially with all the Bethesda games I have.
---
I need to know the boundaries. I'm working my arse off to earn real money to pay to play these games. If I can be banned for trading between characters, I want to know about it. What are the rules. OFFICIALLY?
---
switch out the iron fist rank 3 for one rank of each iron : regular, expert and master. this will give you a bigger bang for your perk points 30 percent instead of 20 percent for 3 pp
---
My biggest issue was how many levels it took to get my character where it needed to be.. my second character that is. If you ever want someone to play with let me know! Even with the latest patch/Nerf I see ways to make good damage.
---
But they wouldn't get as much attention and admiration for their hours spent on the game
---
Haha as if anyone uses mics anyway. They'll speak [the language](https://i.imgur.com/xtvoOGF.png) most of us do. 
---
This. So much this. I have people who say that games don’t have any content.... after they put hundreds of hours, finishing all the content not even three months after launch. I’m only level 12 cause I thought “hey I’m going to give this game some time to bake” and ended up going back and finally playing Fallout 4! Or you know other stuff too. This is not a traditional Bethesda RPG, it’s a live game that evolved over time. 
---
The keyword being “time”, give it some and you’ll be surprised. Destiny didn’t get good till about a year after launch. I’m using that time-scale. 
---
Fallout 76 is the best game I have never played.
---
The online drama alone created by this game is entertaining as all hell.
---
This is about the hundredth post just like this. You are just as bad honestly 
---
I don't know why fortnight of all games is the one they want to test cross play with.. but we have some really awesome exclusives if you do take the plunge! And if you do hit me with your gamertag!
---
The inside was even more crammed with stuff, like why do you need 3 of each crafting station per floor.
---
What a joke Bethesda is
---
What platform? I can craft variants of most and know several guaranteed spawn locations for fatigues
---
SHE JERKED ME OFF
---
BECAUSE MY ARMS WERE BROKEN AND I COULDNT JERK MYSELF OFF
---
&gt;Instigating is a terrible roll for a Gatling gun.
---
And I kill scorched beasts solo with it just fine.  Yet people are bitching about how their nerfed  two- shot explosive Gatling gun makes it harder to take out scorch beasts- even though their two- shot does more than twice the damage as mine. 
---
You’re not wrong and I’m glad you’re speaking your mind 
---
Will do man, all my buddies are on PS4, so it just makes sense....waiting on that big Sony announcement if it ever comes this year 
---
Hey! I spent 650 hours on complaining about these complaints and you've done nothing to fix it. FIX IT NOW OR I'M QUITTING!!!!....
---
It's a bandaid fix to stop duping. They don't know how to stop duping, despite being a massive videogame company, so they have to do this instead
---
jesus
---
That's an easy profit and is impressive you got that many serums. One thing you spelt serum wrong on your shop.
---
Surem 
---
I get perks that I have maxed out still in the perk pack a lot lol I have a bunch of extras that I don't need, some max out twice!!
---
I'd be cool with Player Vending being in Vault 76 :)
---
No you're not. You're totally gloating. Which is fine I guess, if it makes you feel better about yourself. I have hundreds of hours in the game and have enjoyed it quite a bit. To each their own. 
---
Same thing. Walking a place I had not been, I can loot someone else’s meat pile. It’s weird. 
---
There is no "code" involved in this change.
---
Hey, you liar, you don't hate to be a downer.
---
9 hours a day every day since launch, it is clearly doable if you really Center your life around the game, personally I'm not a super busy person so I have allot of free time to play and I'm pretty close to 400 hours while working a full time job and I've been playing it less and less lately, I could play it more but I don't have the desire to.
---
What's crazy to me is there are people with 760 played and have spent more time on the game than the developers that are paid to work on it
---
Whoops, lol not sure how I missed that. 
---
115 on PC very few issues just minor annoyances. Nothing game breaking. Never got TSE either lol. 
---
Now give me your downvotes. 
---
Lol oops 
---
I have a fix for the low levels getting in. Center prime in the nuke zone. Being higher level and even better a team the rads are nothing but a low level running in would melt pretty fast.
---
are you in power armor? because that may be the case. 
---
People can still play a mess regardless how many hours they put in. I'm fact, b those who do put in lots of hours can provide meaningful feedback to Bethesda. 
---
My previous point was the fact that known bugs of previous games continue to be a problem here, and the latest batch reverting back to a previous build. 
---
They're not responding to people whose games are bugged and can't play, or to people who have been permanently banned and are trying to appeal...  And you want them to state they officially approve you using a friend to hand your other character some resources?  That ain't gonna happen.  And at any rate, they can ban you for anything they want or for nothing at all.  I don't understand really why you'd even think this was against the rules...
---
I might buy healing Factor from you very soon though
---
welcome to playing the game like the rest of us have (again)
---
Big if true. YouTuber did get some things wrong and kind of helped spread fake news with commenting on certain bugs and dupes being back when that was all just hearsay. Bobby pin weight was definitely true though!
---
when beta testers tell you the game is trash, and you knowingly still release it despite the shitstorm you knew was coming, when you release it directly because you know steam offers refunds and will review bomb the ever living fuck outta you.......... 3 months these nuts........
---
I’m in a similar situation having been out of work since early December due to injury and I’ve logged up about 200 hours total. I can see how someone could rack a lot of time up if it’s all they’ve got to pass the time during the healing process. 
---
Hopefully your PT is coming along and you get back to health sooner than later!
---
Maybe try server hopping more than two times?
---
I’ll always be selling!
---
JUST KILL ALL THE TURRETS you might lose the caps but at least know you did the right thing
---
You remind me of Bob Ross and it's awesome!
---
Next time be sure to incorporate happy little trees!
---
Nuka grape to take care of rads. 
---
Good to know! I'll save this post for whenever I need mutations.
---
I’ve played since the beta, over 250 hours now. The first 100 or so were on the original Xbox One, then I switched to a One X.
---
I didn’t have extreme issues on either console, but the X definitely performs better. With a 4K HDR TV it also looks dramatically better. I get the occasional crash, though no more frequently than I did with Fallout 4. Server disconnects happen, but not all that often, and that happens with any online game.
---
I’m not discounting anyone else’s experience—obviously some people are having a time of it with this game—but in mine, the good has far outweighed the bad. 
---
Ooh and talons is good too
---
we're not talking about crimes. we're talking about morality and how it's based in harm. it's no wonder abstract ideas of right and wrong fly by you completely since you seem to revert to the literal details all the time.
---
also, if we're going to be pedantic and specific, yes it is a crime. not in any court of law, but against their terms of service. but really, let's not delve into a semantic debate of what constitutes a crime - it's completely irrelevant.
---
&gt;I don't play fo76 because it's a trainwreck with economy crippling glitches. 
---
not really relevant whether you play the game or not. but if you were, and you duped because "it's their fault", then that would be akin to moving to a crime-ridden neighborhood, do crimes, and then complain about "the crippling and rampant crime". i don't need to tell you how ridiculous that is, do i?
---
I am getting tired of all the same post in here lately and clicked on the r/fo76filthycasuals sub just then to see something different as suggested and literally the first post I see is a "I am sick of this game and I'm quitting" post.
---
My biggest issue that only happened twice, is she would fly off the map.. we would scope in on her in the extreme distance.. she was just frozen. But the framerate issue seemed to be mostly fixed around the same time.
---
Pro tip if you're launching the nuke, miss the prime site by a little and most of the fight is outside of the nuke zone.. yes, you'll have less/no other legendaries, but the fight is so smooth!
---
I also think this last patch which will force people to stop using other characters as mules (or dupers, whatever).. I think this will only help server stability.
---
Its the poltryghiest - the evil spirit of the skyrim chickens that you killed coming back to haunt you in other Bethesda games. 
---
But seriously, I have this problem all the time in white spring golf club. Drives me nuts.
---
Bethesda takes one step forward and one step back
---
Do you not think that way more people would be banned if only crafting bullets would result in a ban? Come on man use some common sense. 
---
Okey maybe it's more like they want to one-shot everything but they don't realize it will become boring pretty fast.
---
Not making shit up. The biggest flame is the nerf on the explosive and two shot, either you haven't been around here enough or you are in denial.
---
i have uninstalled this game for now.  thank you for the motivation.
---
Is farming bleached dogwood on trees for just 1 purrified water a piece really more efficient then just having a water purifier at your base?
---
There's a great idea 
---
After mutations and unyielding you should be doing around 3k
---
Hey they need to increase length of play without adding new content. This is how they do it
---
Isn't it 8€ or something? Come on dude.
---
welp i guess all those black market guns on youtube can disappear now................
---
I cringed when i read «vast majority»... everyone posting on Reddit is a vocal minority
---
If you loose it I will sell the serum for 300 caps 🧢 
---
Nah they’ll never do it. They want to increase the grind not decrease it
---
Yes, rules. I know what you're saying, but when there's a threat of an account being banned, it'd be nice to know the rules behind it. 
---
Real life too, but real life says ignorance of the law is not an excuse.
---
Do you have Speed Demon mutation? Are you active drug user?
---
Umm... 
---
Foreseeable consequences:
---
* Tiny window for beta means few problems fixed
---
* Quick hacky solution for ultra-wide support by stretching the screen make people unhappy
---
* Back lash over replacing canvas bag with a nylon one
---
* Sizable discount during Black Friday 2 weeks after launch would lead to very unhappy pre-order customers
---
* Making quiet little changes would get noticed by the community
---
* Making the game slower and grindier would make people unhappy
---
* Including loot boxes would cause a backlash in the community, particularly given the current climate on loot boxes.
---
* Unstoppables event would make people concerned about pay-to-win mechanics
---
* Nerfing explosives perk would affect already weak explosives heavy weapons to making something that wasn't already viable even less so
---
I could go on all day.
---
&gt; you haven't been paying attention. 
---
Sounds like your projection is showing.
---
&gt;big fucking patches at a lightning pace which have dramatically improve the game
---
Thanks dude, I'm in tears.
---
Really.....this is just becoming sad.  Issues with the game aside.....take some ownership of it instead of treating it like its somehow the players fault....why can people write 3 word posts about "goodpatch" but "bad patch" gets deleted by the mods.
---
Maybe people want to search keywords with bad patch in it......stop deleting crap based on obvious bias.
---
Could you imagine the bugs that would occur if Bethesda tried to do such a thing, it would be absolute madness
---
Well it did JUST get patched like 2 days ago. Not THAT many people are actually buying items for irl money contrary to the belief around here so those mules are gonna sit around with stock to sell for awhile unless they catch a ban. Seriously the MODUS patch was the REAL dupe method. Random people would invite me on Xbox asking to do it with me and most people on here don’t even know how to do it.
---
Idk, I broke my last ps4, got a new one for about 200 bucks at Christmas.. not a heavy entry price for the exclusives you have access to. If and when Microsoft really creates a next gen console that beats the living shit out of ps4 pro, I'll jump ship, or at least buy a buoy..
---
In the end, the sad idea- I think it's us on console versus the PC people that want to try to stay relevant.. This game isn't doing them and favors 😋 master race my ass 😂🤣
---
SHE USED HER MOUTH TO JERK EM OFF BECAUSE THEIR ARMS WERE BROKENS
---
Overseer: Be a cunt. That is all.
---
Damn straight. I have one too without the perks and i'm fine as well.
---
I'm sure there is a lawsuit in here somewhere...
---
I've walked around with 40 fire axes in my inventory and currently have two legendaries that are exactly the same I picked up from trading. They're 2 star anti-armor fire axes with power attack damage
---
Agreed, I don’t care what anyone says...being able to sit on my couch in comfort is worth the trade. They can keep their desk chair and mouse 💁🏻‍♂️
---
Where do I get that check? I've been working probono far too long 🤔
---
Maybe they should try better programming and optimization.
---

I think he was saying if people judge good off of time spent playing then games may become grindier to create longer playtimes instead of entertaining ones.

Sometimes ho fix just means a rapid unscheduled update.

This is a rapid, unscheduled update. 
---
Between marketing and developers...
---
You care enough to reply; to waste your time,
---
To scream into an unforgiving, blackened void. 
---
Why would I play a game for over 300 hours if I didn't find it entertaining?
---
Food and water doesn’t need the separation cause some food decrease thirst.
---
Lmao, Bethesda, what are you fucking doing m8?
---
INCONCEIVABLE! 
---
So if only 10% of the sub is really active, then the rest would be considered casual members right? 
---
I have no diseases or mutations.
---
Take a shot everytime Bethesda fucks up something
---
I love you OP!!!
---
Or is it the semantics…?
---
No thanks. Lag or not I want nothing to do with the travesty that is that camp anywhere near me. 
---
No it's a pretty accurate way of describing removing posts based on what you think is effortless regardless of what everyone else thinks.
---
Power trip is exactly what this all is.
---
I really wanted to but I also really didn't want to lose all the caps. And even if I destroyed them, he probably has a hundred more stashed.
---
Thank you for this. They all needed to hear that and it's important it got traction on this sub!
---
Oh I'm not arguing, it's doable. I can binge video games with the best of them, but 9hrs a day for 79 straight days.. hell no, I'd grow to hate every game out there I feel like. 
---
I choose to not play fo76 as much because it's a broken beta game that was released as a finished product with more controversy surrounding it and it's gimmicky trash bag and cheap liquor charades. I want it to be a good AAA title like it should be, that's what the player base needs to be upset about (especially preorders), this game is nothing like it was advertised and plays like hot garbage. But dont worry you can buy a super ugly coat for $276 which I'm sure is only using the absolute best materials money can buy... 
---
I'm really hoping Bethesda doesn't abandon this game but unless they kick out fixes way faster than they are this game will have a very small player base if any. 
---
Lol I guess so
---
R/choosingbeggers
---
i'd like to know how there isn't even a non-functional fridge we can put in our camps, they're all over the world so why can't I have one? and don't even get me started on the fact there isn't a sink. 
---
Mostly travel. Currently trying to get all camp and recipe plans as well. 
---
"everyone in the Scorched Earth event already should have access to the Ultracite Power Armor"...half the people who show up can't wear anything but an empty frame &gt;;(
---
You should stop playing the game for your own sanity. A person can only take so many kicks to the nuts before they flip out. Just stop and come back later when the vaults open up. 
---
We took out a scorch beast queen tonight in ten minutes.  The TSE nerf cause no problems whatsoever. 
---
The amount of butt hurt over it is getting ridiculous. 
---
I've run into that squad of people doing their own griefing, lol... They just go about it differently. They game the system.
---
I could go for an ice cold nuka cola. 
---
No cause just like all the other complaining people they will inevitably go back and play. 
---
*I* enjoy playing the game. That doesn't mean I post love letters to Bethesda on Reddit.
---
Game sucks lol
---
Then why not just say that? Except they call it 'unplayble' and argue from an emotional point.
---
People proudly stating they've spent hundreds of hours playing something they absolutely hated every second of the way, is interesting. But they're leaving now, so there's no use in talking them out of it. They've made up they're minds. So, it's "goodbye cruel world!" 
---
The bugs are frustrating; Bethesda made mistakes. Calling for them to shut down the servers is ridiculous. The moment Bethesda does that it will be an even bigger outcry, law suits and lots of therapy. Besides, then they can't do the whole " I'm quitting!" act for attention.
---
There should have been 20 different bosses to spawn via nukes scattered across all over the map. Each one with unique patterns, weaknesses, strengths, loot tables and environmental interactions and effects depending on the area.
---
That would not only increase build diversity greatly, it would also make for a varied endgame.
---
I should stop posting on reddit and just install MHW again. ;)
---
That's my point, the good outweighed the bad. I forgot about how bad the scorch queen beast was the first few times I tried her.. that was definitely my biggest issue. But I forgot about it because after some updates it simply isn't an issue.
---
250 huh? I feel like I would be there if I just moved points around.. I went with 4 pieces of unyielding, so every though I only have 7 strength it sits at 25.. But that's why I left my melee build character there. In case I wanted to go that way again.
---
Let me know if you want someone new to play with, I'll pm you my gamer tag. Even at 168 I'm constantly looking at different ways to spend my points.. especially with the latest update/Nerf. I have a few guns that make it work.. but it's hard on 75% of the weapons I keep on me.
---
Lol right? Nobody needs an announcement but the cry babies that cant have it their way always gotta let everyone know that their butt is hurting.
---
Saying reddit has no statistical significance is a display of ignorance in the science.
---
Go to any other social platform Bethesda at and see the same results.
---
Casual players like us don't represent majority.
---
Open PVP.
---
People may very well still have a secret way to dupe but all I’m saying is that by saying “duping is back” or “they reintroduced duping” that I’ve seen many times, people are implying that the old dupe method that was fixed is no longer fixed. All I’m saying is that’s not true since I haven’t seen one person present evidence and I actually have. Same thing happened with people talking about the fusion cores recharge rate and other bugs that turned out to not be true. Just wish people would do a little research first is all.
---
It's an emotional release for the anger and frustration they feel, like telling someone what you think of them to burn a bridge.
---
Enjoyment of a game doesn't usually provoke epistles.
---
have you not see the front page for the last few days? why would you go doing it after knowing people got supposedly banned for crafting?
---
&gt; But is “offline” mode too much to ask or incompatible with Bethesda’s vision? 
---
Of course. Bethesda has to basically give you all of the server code.
---
You have to understand what that entails. 
---
Can you run the server and client together on the same device? Do you have enough raw power for it? Do you have enough hard drive space? Bear in mind not everyone is on PC so there are console-specific implications for this plus code is likely different between platforms so you'd have to write server code for all of these platforms.
---
You're giving over server code. Further implications include reverse engineering. Once people can do that, what's stopping them from either being even better able to find exploits and hacks to use on the main online server, or even worse, be able to run their own private pirate servers and potentially take away future revenue from the company because the game can actually be meaningfully pirated.
---
On top of all of this is the extra man power required to do it. Do you think Bethesda is going to do all this work for free?
---
If anything, the offline component is the most unrealistic thing to happen. You'd more likely see proper RPG elements brought into the game before the offline thing happens because at least then the effort to do so would be financially worth it for them (if it's worth it at all).
---
I don't see connection to thread. I havent done that, that's it.
---
Not saying I agree, explaining what he meant. Some grind to get over a hump in hopes of the "fun starting" then 
---
Tldr
---
Confirmed. Game broken on PS4
---
You should setup game share with your son. Gf and I do it and save so much money
---
This has been on and off for a while now, both before the hotfix and before patch 5. 
---
Some worlds whitespring fives legendaries on as high as &gt;50% of ghouls. 
---
Some have a single legendary beater per mob. 
---
Some are in between. 
---
What this seems to be is consistent to the world, so if you stick around, the next mob has the same ratio as the last one. 
---
Hop worlds and you get a different drop rate. 
---
What I’ve started doing is finding a rich world before nuking WS. 
---
Yaw'll hit the others, so I'll raise you one,

*Sim-antha*
---
 She plays the Sims like her name implies but she has got deep i to Fallout 76 and offers a fresh perspective to the wasteland, mostly plays solo and keeps the commentary going while making a genuine effort to get better at the game, check her out, (she loves killing Super mutants)
---
You really must be upset if you forgot half the reasons why...sheesh
---
As of now, my game and launcher is uninstalled and i am proud of it !
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer any team take on this idea?  Has the idea of a basement for shelter from a blast been thrown around at all?
---
Arrows sitting and spinning upon scorch queen quest, not just the queen, but every creature.
---
A perfect use for the orbital strikes I keep crafting 
---
LOL. Only slightly less bad than the people asking for people's game :)
---
Let me use one of your own quotes back at you.
---
"Should I not do something that I enjoy because some random person that means nothing to me doesn't like it? What kind of logic is that exactly?"
---
Short version: Is there a little atom icon next to the headlamp?
---
Holy fuck, I swear I'm the only person that tried to make a really really big TV and my PC work from my couch.. it was far too much work, damn.
---
And I have a 4k tv. Sure, it's kind of pretty sometimes, but the amount of expense to make that worthwhile on PC.. fuck that. 
---
Almost every YongYea video on Fallout 76.
---
No, I'm just saying nuke zones shouldn't be PA required. I think it would be nifty if there were a perk tree for it. We're wasteland survivors, not Space Marines
---
Okay you are *way* too eager on your trigger finger here so calm down alright? I used sales figures as a reference to how it seems like this game hasn't been doing so well due to word-of-mouth from a lot of the player base.
---
If people enjoy this game then I am thrilled for them, I have not once attacked a person because they said they enjoyed Fallout 76 and I have not tried to change their mind about liking it because *that's incredibly stupid.*
---
So I'm gonna need you to, ahem, *get over yourself* first and realise that I was simply using the sales figures as a point of argument that its a strong part of the player base that has disliked this game to the point it's gone on sale. *Twice*.
---
I’ve been a casual fallout player for ages. I absolutely agree with this post
---
I'm literally level 66 as of tonight been playing since beta, yeah, it's annoying the glitches and bugs, but it's a online game, that's to be expected, it's the first online fallout game. So I'm really happy with the game, and I know they'll fix bugs as they come up, but a test server would not be a bad things to test patches before they go live.
---
Quote a fuckwit who can't die...
---
I don't think Bethesda has given us official rules regarding mule characters and inter-account trading. 
---
PC
---
How about you don't fix items that aren't broken, like all basic guns are now worthless, don't unfix errors - Bobby pins back to original weight, and fix the huge amount of bugs. Killed a scortched officer, no nuke code but light blinking. Enemies walking through closed doors etc. Game is now unplayable.
---
Troubleshoot it remove some walls 
---
Lmao. You comment creeper. If you had to go digging you already lost the argument. 
---
Really? Cuz the top post on there right now that’s not sticky says something to the effect of ‘I’m sorry it’s come to this, but I am NOT quitting’
---
I play on PS4 and I have had my share of issues.  I would never say that this has been a smooth ride. 
---
As for PC gamers, I will say that they seem to complain a lot more about... well everything. 
---
I think it’s just the server input cause it doesn’t always happen in the same spots
---
I see where you're coming from, it's where I feel like I'm going, I want to enjoy it but it's just not enjoyable really, like I have some friends I play with on it and just screwing around I'm game joking with them is really the only way it's fun but we're all playing less and less and not on at the same times and I just try to get on and do the daily/weekly challenges to get atoms in the event they suprise us and add something cool to the atom shop
---
With an attitude like that I'm not surprised. I know it's tough to see context on the interwebs but you come off as a prick with saying shit that way.
---
I can confirm. My TSE black powder rifle does about 25% what it used to do. Does it slow me down? Yep. Can I still kill 2 Scorchbeasts at the same time? Yep. It really does get easier as you level higher. At level 50 there was no way I could solo a Scorchbeast with what I had. Now that I'm 100+ it's not so bad even when I'm being chased around by 5-6 Scorched. If Scorchbeasts are endgame, they should be hard. I think the balance is working. No one likes to get nerfed especially when they were seriously overpowered. Meh. It doesn't bother me all that much. I like rifles too much. I like watching mobs heads pop off their bodies. It entertains me.
---
There's been a lot. No reason to pad it out by mentioning rum bottles, canvas bags, or jackets. Because they don't actually have anything to do with the game 
---
Ah yes here's variant 206 of the "Bethesda is actually Vault-Tec running an experiment" post
---
Ohhh. That's why I don't like reading most of this vitriol now.
---
Thanks!
---
Its probalby so you can use a stock but keep as a pistol
---
&gt;and the ability to 1 shot everything that's not a scorched queen....
---
Is that even necessary? My power fist sits at 370 and even a scorchbeast is dead after 10 hits or something and I'm still able to facetank SQB and all her adds. Usually when she dies I realize 10 mobs have been hitting me all the time. ;)

This moment when your controller is so broken that the triggers get stuck but you already own Fo76...
---
My god can they not make one patch without a major glitch popping up.
---
Explosive Vents? 
---
LUXURY! 
---
All I got was 91 rusty knuckles plans! 
---
Like; why Is there even rusty knuckles in the game? Is there a single player who put them on anything, ever? 
---
10600+ comments but the games fine?
---
Its always a pleasant surprise to be plinked off by mid air to fall and die, it's true. I like more an OX-01 &amp; All Rise * combo. 
---
If you’re duping explosive vents, well I’ve got an oceanfront CAMP to sell you in Clarksburg. 
---
Live-service cash grab while the main studio works on Starfield.
---
My friend and I were traveling through the woods when we got attacked by one that did NOT want to leave us alone. She was a lower level and didn't want to fight it.
---
We killed it and it didn't have anything exciting on it.
---
It's pretty cool to get a chance to get a closer look at it though. And I'd love to have that purple color effect on my laser weapons.
---
No you did, by your own words.
---
Nerfing the TSE send a lot of people into a blind rage.  They are infuriating that they now have to play the game as the rest of us do have been for several months now.
---
The cute little penguins that use to huddle together for safety and comfort from the bitter winds of criticism have now turned feral with all the constant failures that Bethesda has brought onto the game. A lot of faith and trust has been betrayed.
---
Ahem, So by simply stating it went on sale “twice”...that you’ve proven some kind of point? It’s a fact that that didn’t sell like Fallout 4, 3, or NV .... BUT, Bethesda already predicted that it wouldn’t. Do you assume, in your obviously superior business acumen, that you have pointed something out that they didn’t see themselves? By pointing out that it didn’t sell, you’re trying to diminish the game. We’re not stupid, that was exactly what you were trying to say...so just say it. Get over yourself.
---
It's ok. I know it's hard when you have to take other people's words and shoehorn them into something that doesn't really fit. Someday you'll think for yourself!
---
I was casually walking trough the mire when this sucker appeared. It scared me to death, funnily enough it was one shot. Ive only seen 1 of them so far. 
---
I really don't think it's too much to ask a AAA studio to make a game without critical bugs
---
Your logic is flawed.....yes the members of this sub are not the majority of people who have played at least 1 second of FO76.......but I'm willing to guess they are the majority of people still playing.   They are also the ones with the most experience with the game and its various issues and are much more suited to determine what is broken or not from the latest patch.
---
The people who haven't beat the questline likely never will.  Those majority of people who never killed the SQB are the same people who are unlikely to buy stuff from the ATOM store.  So yes Bethesda does care about the small fraction of players here far more then the casual players......the casual players are not making them any more money and let's be real that's what they care about.
---
It's hard to say. While there have been a lot of legitimate screw-ups (this last patch is a doozy) there have been just as many overblown, if not outright made up, scandals and disasters. Hell, I'm half expecting people to start blaming their hair loss or loosing their car keys on 76.
---
It didn't seem to last long, I imagine that guy got booted off there really quick by the looks of it. They actually have rules posted up to avoid those kinds of posts by the looks of it (and yes i saw the i am not quitting one furthur down).
---
I have been going through the rest of the posts since then and these guys are more at my kind of pace.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I didn't know about this one!
---
Sandy vag city in nerdville 
---
I'll be building my CAMP at Whitespring just for you.
---
They're frustrated and angry and posting about it on Reddit is an emotional release.  Enjoying something rarely provokes the same intensity of reaction.
---
I say this as someone who enjoys the game. I play daily. The bugs irritate me, and some of these fuck-ups are really beyond the pale, but I'm still mostly having fun.  I can't imagine a game that I could enjoy enough to post love letters to the company on Reddit, though.
---
Thanks for the reply. I appreciate you giving me an answer, that really isn't an answer but more of a reason to not play this game. In the spirit of trying to do right by this company, I won't purchase anymore games. 
---
I'm on ps4 right now would like to get some psn:Chakrachaos99
---
Yes x1000

Yea I must be popping a tin of dog food and 2 purified waters every 15minutes. 
---
&gt; Not on when customers using an international service have to wait for 1 guy to wake up is it really ;)
---
Well, OP is going outside of normal support channels, so it's not exactly a normal situation. 
---
It would be neat to have different laser "crystals" that changed the color of energy weapons. Yeah, mine didn't have anything good on it either. Just felt satisfying killing something I hadn't seen.
---
Addiction......
---
Not saying that's the case but there are reasons people do things they no longer find entertaining. 
---
Upvoting because you’re essentially correct. I’ve known that a shift has been coming for awhile now, realistically has been here.
---
I’ve long been on the relatively high end of the ‘casual vs hard-core’ scale. While I don’t go all-in on min-maxing, or 100% completion, ultra-max difficulties, or any number of other standard behaviors, I put thousands of hours a year into gaming because I’m seriously disabled and it helps keep me sane.
---
And I hate, hate, *hate* the trend so many companies have taken towards ‘bite-sized’ mobile gaming and the psychological hooks they use with them.
---
Stamina limits, clicker games, daily dungeons, daily quests, seasonal achievements, etc etc etc. Most of the genres I grew up with are either totally gone or radically changed. Now things are designed for the player without a lot of time but also to keep them coming back every day. Things are designed to encourage a player to pick up a game and keep playing it for months on end if they want everything.
---
I hate it because... I *do* have the time. I don’t have a normal job, so I can afford to sit and play 12 hours a day. I enjoy shitty gacha games from time to time, but for 95% of them I basically would have to play 4 at once to full my time.
---
And you know what? I’ve learned that I’ve just got to deal. I’m getting up there in age. The world moves on, moves faster, I’m not the main target demographic as much as I used to be. I grew up in an era where videogame nerds were rare. Nowadays, if news is to be believed, at my highschool I’d be in the company of 300 students playing Fortnite instead of just 10-15.
---
And guess what? Companies have metrics on this sort of thing. They know who’s playing their games, and if the market is any judge, its not people with my preferences. Casual are targeted more and more and more, with companies wanting to be the next big viral hit - The next L4D, the next Minecraft, the next PuBG, the next Fortnite. That means targeting broad audiences, which also means targeting the people who have school and work and lives, not the cultural minority who sits in their rooms and plays for 10 hours a day.
---
So while there is something to be said for demanding game devs not fuck up their game with untested or poorly tested patches and features that cause game-breaking bugs or things that cause players to lose their hard work, people need to stop using weasel words to imply that ‘everyone’ shares the same opinion as them, when we’re at best a vocal minority. People should express their opinions in better terms - calm discussion of ‘I hate this’ and ‘this upset me’ - not raging against the stars as if the heavens themselves opposed you and everyone else.
---
So yeah. Have an upvote.
---
hmm i get your point and yeah its getting a little overboard im trying to stay away from the overly crazy posts like im "quiting this game " or my favorite "im never buying from bethesda again " type of posts. im not upset and wanting to quit the game forever since im planing to lauch some nukes sat and sunday but i am however frustrated over it and at the same time i think what the f*** its a game dont be so dramatic but just to get the player base some what on board buff the weapons and nerf the enimes or not at all but still have alot of players but just not the cry babies i guess.
---
The only people being paid are the shills.
---
A quick google search just turns up posts similar to this one, so I'd guess it's either remnant code from a cut quest, or partial code for a future quest.
---
Which are those though?
---
I'm trying to explain to you how probability works because you keep making statements and arguments that demonstrate that you don't fully understand. You're speaking to a math professor. Most people have the same intuition about probability that you do, and I always have some students who really struggle to understand why it's wrong. None of them have ever been this rude, though.
---
Definitely a few in that thread you posted.
---
Nope. I'll come back in a couple of months
---
"..Vent our frustration..", "...complaining about.."
---
how does that not translate to whining?
---
"...so we have the right to vent our frustration.."
---
Sure you've got the right to whine, just like everyone has the right to call such people 'big babies'. And you've got the right to get upset about that and rage post about that too. It's just not going to achieve anything except making you look like a whiner.
---
Publicly announcing you're leaving, will just seem like attention seeking behaviour. 
---
Oh, you mean console players like the ones in the only link I provided?
---
See it’s funny because you could be talking about Harpers Ferry and I’d have no idea
---
One of my online buddies was describing my hometown of Lewisburg and his time there, and until he mentioned Fallout I thought he actually came here. To name a little of what he had to say: “toxic zombies”, “communism spewing robots” and that raiders note that mentions everyone here having their head up their ass thinking they’re better than they are
---
If I had to guess I'd bet the nuke crashes the server when it forces thousands of items into a bag when people in the blast zone die.  Maybe drop multiple bags over a few seconds, and stagger character deaths of those in blast zones.
---
But tbh I got no idea.
---
&gt;My TSE black powder rifle does about 25% 
---
Based on what I saw in the video posted, 25 percent of what it was is still A SHIT LOAD OF DAMAGE compared to nearly all other legendary effects. 
---
I don't think the problem is the nerf. I think the problem is that Bethesda ever put this weapon in its former state to begin with. 
---
Do they even test their own games?   
---
I keep going back to the Gatling laser. This weapon takes considerable grinding to get the plans, and more grinding to get materials to build it with. 
---
This weapon is billed as an "end game weapon" for heavy weapons characters in particular. 
---
And the damn thing is weak as hell and breaks easy.  I wonder: what they hell was Bethesda thinking? Did they actually play their own game?
---
I lost it at dissertation and I totally agree with you.
---
Avid FO4 junkie here. 
---
Too avid. I’m the nut that wrote this: https://steamcommunity.com/app/377160/discussions/0/1486613649675217071/
---
Junkie builds would need more than perm addictions to make sense.
---
Junkie adds 15% damage per addiction. 
---
F4 has 13 (including the dark craving sort-of addiction), making junkie weapons a non-situational x2.95 damage weapon. In a world with non-situational x1.1-x1.4 damage effects, or situational ones (nocturnal, instigating etc) that cap at about x2, a non-situational x2.95 weapon was something to work for. 
---
It was well balanced too. You had to make many significant compromises to make it work. 
---
Fallout 76 has 8 chem addictions (read it somewhere on the internet, so it must be true). If all of them were perma-on, you’re looking at a  on-situational x2.2 damage weapon. 
---
A bloodied weapon on a rad build is a non-situational x1.9 weapon. 
---
(I’m not counting other low-health multipliers like adrenal reaction and nerd rage because they can be applied equally to a rad+junkie and a rad+bloodied)
---
So you’re not that far off already if you’re into high-compromise, high-damage builds. 
---
Well, since some of those "bugs" he's talking about are unconfirmed at best, he did violate rule 7, and lord knows a lot of people have been violating rule 10 the last couple of days. 
---
Lady Bug or Zaxxon?
---
Killed 3 SBQ, never launched a nuke. Why wasting time when someone else can.
---
Tbf i really enjoy the SBQ fight, working together to get her down. The only downside is that seemingly none of my weapons do more to her then a scratch. I feel kinda useless sometimes (lvl63) 
---
I'm on console and I've had just as many issues as everyone else. Maybe even more blue screen crashes at times.
---
That logic when applied to white knight is what annoys me. "This perk is mandatory to armor builds because shit durability." "Let's nerf it so people don't feel so compelled to take it."
---
What about those of us who aren't in the united states?
---
All I know is that I like the game a lot and I'm having a lot of fun, so....
---
I'm assuming their metrics showed that lots of players (probably lowbies) were using that perk. It's like saying one of the starters on warframe is used too much and nerfing it based on that.
---
Communist mods? Do they make sure the playing class gets answers from bethesda?
---
Been having a bug from before the patch that removes all positive aspects of mutations, but it’s visible in status
---
I'm definitely more than a little drunk right now.. where do us totally not related people get our paychecks? Because I can barely see your name.. something about a Jedi.. where do I get my money please sir?
---
I dislike not being able to know where the blast radius is, maybe make the circle (on the map) smaller? Radiation is fine the way it is. I would pay for building underground (but dont tell the gremlins in the atom shop that) or making working pulowski shelters. Tripling the blast radius sounds cool but i'm not sure how much it'll actually affect gameplay.
---
Also, if the initial blast had some consequence for standing directly outside the blast radius, that would be cool. While it looks awesome to be standing half a kilometre away from a giant mushroom cloud, I feel like it isn't the greatest idea, especially with all the debris flying afterwards and doing no(?!??!) damage.
---
Did anyone ever get that fish in their ear?  I spent hours trying to figure that out. 
---
I know it makes a bigger number on your screen, but incisor will actually result in you doing more damage to things than 15% damage from 2 stars of slugger perks.
---
Lol it's a video game
---
I don't know about anyone else but I've never met a person who said, boy I can't afford that mod, can you do it for me instead got cheaper? Running a few days off vendor rounds will get enough caps. Increasing cap costs only forces people into this undesirable behavior, and effectively not fun gameplay. Why play the game for caps, just do a laborious chore for a week, then server hop for a few hours to find the server that still has the plans. 
---
Not buying this explanation.
---
I'll never progress in the game again if this is added. Stardew Valley, Terraria, Minecraft; any game that has fishing, I will waste time doing nothing but camping in front of a lake for hours.
---
Agree - my camp has never been attacked other two or three times by  the occasional very low level ghoul
---
Yes.
---
Had rad worms recently?
---
Did you equip (or did a teammate share) Strange in Numbers before either you left the team or the person who shared it left?
---
Please do explain, as the only person to say something contrary. I mean that literally, explain.
---
Fucking hell. I know 76's code is... "unoptimized", but I think that thing would lag damn near any game.
---
I do not know the laws of other countries. I do know that the EU is way ahead of the US when it comes to the internet and law. Just reference what is happening to Facebook. If you want to look into it for your country, just Google it.
---
must be doupers downvoting, this is fact.
---
Oh noooo
---
The banning is the fix, clearly.
---
If I was truly trying to diminish the game and tell everyone they shouldn't like it, I'd be on every single topic posting the ever growing list of problems to every single positive comment that was ever posted here. But I don't, I stick to making replies to the topic and jumping in where my opinion is relevant, because I'm not going to dictate who gets to enjoy what and shove my opinions down their throat.
---
If Bethesda predicted this game wouldn't sell well (and they overpredicted hard), then why not sell this game at $40 standard? By pointing out that the game didn't sell well and stating it went on sale twice (Should I mention the recent stories of stores trying to give their Fallout copies away or does that damage the narrative?) I'm illustrating that there must have been a significant user backlash over the gameplay or business practices, thus making the users who pushed back more than a "Vocal Minority" as I wrongly assumed the original reply was detailing.
---
And yes I know what the next argument is. "You're just a FO76 hater no better than those YouTubers" so people can skip over that because it's wrong.
---
Don't mention the war.  I did once, but I think I got away with it..
---
People want to use their guns.
---
I swear I saw a scorched Dogmeat in a SBQ fight. A German shepherd wearing a dog helmet.
---
Absolutely! It’s a small community right now, but hopefully a growing one. I found it myself from a link on a r/fo76 post, so it’s possible a troll escaped and started running amuck. Anyhow, glad you found a sub that’s more enjoyable!
---
I couldn’t imagine a AAA software house having such poor version control and internal controls that old, patched code could be reintroduced, and not caught before release ... yet here we are
---
They said they were leaving to protect the other Bethesda games they own, so I'm going to say "No".
---
fo3 dogmeat best dogmeat
---
That's the Curse of Oak Island effect. 
---
Let’s buy Tim a holiday present.
---
Kinda hoping they get sued now. Imagine the YouTube videos that will be uploaded.
---
There are pistol grips to use tho, and my character holds it like a rifle...
---
Ok, I will google Bethesda secret police.
---
1) Xbox One X
---
2) sfryman
---
3)  can't screenshot
---
4) Pulling up my pipboy soon after logging in results in a game freeze pretty much every time.  I have to wait a couple minutes or the game locks up.   I just have to force quit and then wait
---
5) No ticket, 
---
Set up by the former secretary of agriculture so he could be elected president so he could continue the war on commies, before MODUS killed him and his staff.

It's pretty funny that the hate train never stops. It's like people didn't learn from ESO. Nobody remembers the "boycott and resist" melodramatic posts when ESO came out?
---
Thank you.
---
Me and my friend bought it shortly after release and had some joy out of it, but after the resent patch me and my 2 other friends went on a 1 and half hour rant complaining about the game over the mic with each other while we were playing Nioh. 
---
I decided to take a break and deleted the game. I pray that they will fix it and give me a good reason to reinstall it again.
---
.....It's a game.
---
The only "issues" I had was transferring worlds, that and I had too many legendaries in my stash. After my ps4 update, I just closed my game instead of switching worlds.. that was 99% of my issues.
---
The problems in this game stack so high they are suffocating.
---
I just want my black three piece suit and lobster trap helmet.
---
no one thinks that. but you said this:
---
&gt;If the code lets you dupe thats their problem.
---
you're just shifting responsibility away from yourself to others. saying "if the game lets you do that, then i see no problem" is similar to saying "well if there's no law that stops me from killing, why shouldn't i kill?"; you have a responsibility to maintain yourself. no one else should have to watch you to make sure you're not being unlawful or immoral: it's up to you.
---
alternatively, if you really do think it's OK being unlawful or immoral, at the very least don't go around telling people brazenly and openly. if you're going to be a psychopath, be smart about it.
---
Can I ask where in the game you found your marine tactical helmet (which you presumably scrapped to get the plan?)
---
Thought I'd be a tad different in posting my thoughts.
---
Not sure if I’m up or down voting :/ 
---
Lmao give them away....now I know you’re full of shit man, wow 
---
Not sure what the cringe link is about sorry. Good / bad?
---
Another reason everyone should UNINSTALL!!!!
---
All the "I was banned for crafting" threads I've seen so far have some sort of caveat, be it "I was using this character as a mule" or "I had picked up some duped items I found" or "I was 10000 lb over-encumbered", so I'm not sure if things are quite this bleak. 
---
That said, taking away all of the Bethesda games that person owns, online AND off, is inexcusable.
---
I'm disabled. I don't work. I live in an apartment with my sister. I don't have a car. I use her car sometimes but it's kind of a junker, I can't go far in it. I can only use it for doctor's appointments and such. I'm on a very small fixed income. Half of which goes to rent. Over half actually. 
---
I am learning Spanish, and guitar, and go walking when it's not freezing out. I just got a bike for when it warms up a little. I can't ride it far. but I will ride it around the block a few times. I don't have much to look forward to. So, I was really looking forward to this game.
---
I built a computer for this game. I saved up for months, for a year, to buy this game and build a PC for it. I played the BETA. I was there when the game files got eaten and I didn't get to play that first night, it was horrible lol. And a harbinger of things to come.
---
I have about 500 or so hours in now. I have 3 characters. One was my first from the BETA and he got glitched out so I had to abandon him. Second character is now level 232. (I wrote earlier it was 212 but I was wrong, it's 232 lol). Anyhow, I spent a lot of time playing this game. I'm not a try hard. I'm not a person who can even figure out how to use armor other than PA, I am horrible with perk card loadouts. I just plod through the map doing this and that and I'm rarely bored. Not yet. I like to help people. I'm hosting a community event this weekend. I do my part. I leave mats and legendaries in containers all over the map for noobs. I give away full sets of PA. I give away plans. I come to the aid of noobs and I fight griefers at every chance. 
---
All that said, I have plowed through the worst glithces/bugs/disconnects/freezes/ YOU NAME IT, it's constant with my game. I've uninstalled and reinstalled so many times. Repaired the game, tried different settings, tried everything. I run it in administrative mode. I do everything Bethesda suggest and it still is fucking insanely broken HALF the time. The other half the time, I have a blast. I've met some great people. I imagine lower level people are afraid when they see someoen over level 200 coming at them but I usually help or offer stuff. I try to spread goodwill through out the map. And I deserve a game that doesn't freeze every half hour or when I get out of my PA. I had so many glitches at one point today I wrote them all down in discord as they were happening
---
*********
---
Second freeze
---
Now it says that my weight is 360/400 BUT I can't run and vats not working
---
Restarted. Got the 'fusion core empty' beeping and had to exit PA but the core is not empty
---
Oh and it shows I have 0 cores
---
I had 10 when I restarted
---
Holy shit the game just ate 10 fcs
---
... And now I can't get out of my PA, no hud either
---
restarting
---
So I click quit to desktop but the launcher says that the game is running
---
T60 helmet off when I reloaded but my fcs are back thank goodness
---
Ok working so far
---
That was a nightmare
---
I also had an invisible super mutant firing a mini gun at me from under the map PLUS I was fighting a behemoth with vats not working
---
Oh yeah and I need to take targeting hud off my t60
---
It is apparently causing crashes
---
My teammate sees me out of my PA but I'm in it
---
So we're restarting Poseiden but one of my teammates can't see either of us, we're having to lead her through the building while we're invisbile to her, great. She even tried going outside and coming back in and restarting the game
---
So my teammates left and I'm trying to do some quests but they're ALL bugged. there's an event on the map but i get there and nothing is happening and if I click on the event it says "fast travel to event for 33 caps?" jesus christ I'm standing right in it 
---
this other event won't trigger either. (both in c. bog)
---
Camden park quest still bugged, gives you credit even if you don't finish it, yay for that
---
*******
---
I stopped writing them down after that, just went around collecting mats
---
I enjoy it, game is fun! fucking toxic community around gaming these days. I do not enjoy. They are not fun.
---
I have one if u wanna buy
---
Normally no, however my ancestor tree does go back to being related to Shakespeare's wife.
---
Okay I'll admit give them away is an exaggeration when the truth of the matter is they were giving copies of Fallout 76 alongside Xbox Ones with Fallout 76 preloaded so you ended up with 2. And another user linked to a story regarding giving FO76 with purchased controllers. I can admit when I stretch the truth, but the rest holds up.
---
Interesting
---
This is a very clear statement of priorities.
---
Try a weapon with anti-armor mod options, the anti-armor legendary effect, and some armor piercing perks. You'll get results close to pre-nerf TSEs.
---
I will be adding you this weekend!
---
We are all Dogmeat.
---
But muh micro-transactions
---
It's the final boss; it's *supposed* to be painful. The lag and freezing are real issues, true, but this is the Big Bad of the game. It should take some real effort to kill it.
---
I've avoided modding on 76
---
Why dramatize this much ? There was a beta before the release. Ppl had their chance to try it out. Game provided at least 50 hours of fine gameplay, about enough for its price, but unfortunately the replayability factor is just tragic for an online game. Its good that they are trying to patch things out. Too bad they aren't serving anything new to the table. I'll wait till the release of survival mode, the only thing that could improve it drastically, if it turns out bad then I'm going to uninstall it. What bothers me is why they havent released the survival mode at the start ? Because that what I was expecting from an online Fallout game. Still having doubts about the planned balance in it where high level gear wont mean a thing and low level players will be able to beat the vets easily. 
---
Just release the server version so we can host our own servers. Have a required set of settings if you want characters to sync with official servers properly. I just want to be able to play on a server with &lt;20ms ping. I'm always connected to North American servers with 300ms ping, I'm in Australia...
---
okay thank you for the adivce ill have to test it out!
---
" The fact is, the 171,000 people on this subreddit are not a representative sample of FO76 players. This sub is a tiny, a teeny-tiny percent of everybody that plays the game. "
---
... Then do not post crap like this here.  Duh.
---
Yes ive had radworms (whitespring) does that suppress mutations?
---
And i play solo so no strange in numbers.
---
And mutation status does have positive and negative effects + i have class freak rank3 
---
Why go that far? 
---
The first thing I did with my kids at around level
---
7 in F76, once we had a few hundred leather and steel, was to craft a shit ton of leather left arms, scrap them (gives nearly all mats back), repeat, until we all knew the leather mods. 
---
Challenges to do that shit are one of the few things to keep you busy in the game. 
---
I’m 100% certain that if the OP just hit some anti duping flag, they’ll unblock him and apologize. 
---
What the fuck are so many people doing carrying around bulk scrap all the time in the first place? The carry weight difference is still laughable. If you're bulking scrap it should be because you're selling it immediately afterward. 
---
MHW :: MH3 as FO4 :: FO3
---
"Capcom care about MH fans" vs "Bethesda have ruined Fallout".
---
You arent a programmer then
---
Then its probably a bug but thats nothing new and i doubt it will be fixed in the near future or even possibly ever
---
Hotfix it? Are you insane?! It was a "hotfix" that broke it in the first place!
---
More than likely this, with creation club style "vetted" mods.
---
I've started to build a second toon for this build, only have a few of the perk cards done and got the eagle eyes mutation and it's looking good. 
---
At lvl 35 in vats with a severe combat rifle (51 damage) I can take down a lvl 68 super mutant brute in 8-10 shots, with the severe combat shotgun it takes 4 shots. This is with no buffs from food or bobble heads and no gun perks.
---
So with all the perks and buffs available it looks like a very viable build for guns, just getting used to the vats play.
---
They are bugged as fuck for me 
---
Confirmed he’s on 76 ....
---
As stew 
---
I have the tools and levels to respec..I shouldn’t have to. I’m level 203. If I want op easy mode I would just build a Bloodied melee build I have the weapons and armor to run that build. I have 3 star Heavy BOS Unyielding Assassin Armor whole matching set.
---
See you proving you don’t understand what the underlying issue is. You assumed it was about entitlement. You are being closed minded and part of the issue.
---
Why the fuck are you even trying to excuse this incompetence? 
---
It was the best pick this generation from the beginning. I had a 360 last gen, but I'll probably be staying with Sony from here out. I have a Nvidia shield for all my steam games so even a pc is unnecessary these days. Get a used ps4 pro, two more years and the ps5 will be here. 
---
You don't sound so sweet yourself. Telling people that some systems are running fine is meant to do just that. Anything else is someone being bitter towards a stranger for having more success than them no fault of their own.

LOL! I honestly did it for them. Not as a threat but as education. Most hackers don't think what they are doing is breaking the law. IMO, dupers no it is wrong but think it is just a game. What is the worst that could happen? Nothing like providing video evidence of your crime. Don't want some 14 year old to loose internet privileges for life for cheating.
---
I’ve playing the game since beta and I’m level... 9 (almost 10 though, weeeee!) 
---
Needless to say 95% of the discussions in this sub fly largely above my head.
---
I mean, that doesn't match the people that aren't actually paid to complain about the game.. our experience, it seems.. seems pretty lame.
---
So you can search and find cry babies that made like 5 posts? That's isn't representing what "our experience is"
---
You're absolutely welcome to ask the community right now.. and I'll sit here and wait for all those people telling you to uninstall your game..
---
But I'm not paid to tell you what to do with your game. My best advice is to complain to people that give a fuck. And that isn't to people that uninstalled their game.
---
Fuck man, why are there people here months after the last time they actually played the game?
---
Why? Because they figured out where to get paid. Rockstar pays them to talk about how shitty this game is, while they literally have the worst most boring game on the planet right there.
---
GTA with cowboys; how do I sign up for this? Just kidding, that game can suck all my nuts, and suck my hard penis besides..
---
Wait, wut? Just kidding, Rockstar can suck all the dick. You're the paid motherfucker. I could give a shit less, I'm too busy playing the game.
---
Just like the real DMV lmao it was my favourite quest
---
I didn't buy this game because I wanted to take a wait-and-see approach to it despite being open minded to the idea. After this boondoggle anything published by Bethesda is now wait-and-see for me. 
---
of course thats why i would love for higher health and lower armor but i think i will change my opioin and say small but noticeible damage buff to the queen.
---
Depends on how you define casual. If you lurk every day but don't post i wouldn't call you casual, just submissive to the environment or afraid of retaliation do to a hostile atmosphere.
---
I'm not saying he cant have them, just giving my experience. You cant server hop for him anyway he isn't in the same place server to server
---
but..but.. it ruins their fantasy world lol
---
The one with extra carrying weight? How much $
---
I dunno if I agree. I've got a Lucky pistol build that I all gonna post a video on this weekend. uses single action, Western , [ lv 10] 1* black powder and a [ lv 10]  mutation pipebolt action rifle. With only pistol based perks ( which apply to pipe weapons as well EVEN pipe rifles) I'm having much more fun than on my dedicated Melee main. I originally started just to snag recipes- now I'm just exploring or hunting solo. I can fill White springs without power armor if no one steals my kills and I can drop protectrons with 2-3 shots. My main revolvers have only upgraded grips and barrels ( I'm guessing .44 has higher armor pen? Kinda gotta stay on top of ammo supply as I've no ammosmith yet at level 30 . This build is not sneak based but speed based. High luck and Agility. No power armor.  This build requires skill but it's really fun especially in PvP.

I run into small issues but nothing that's made me rage and quit. Over 200 hours in and still not salty like the bunch around here. Check out the positive side of 76 fans over at /r/fo76filthycasuals

What about if the radius had varying degrees of damage, and was even bigger and unknown?  So the current circle is dead and devastated, 2r is half, 3r is .3, then 4r is.15?  And unknown drop location.  This is survival mode.  In regular mode, only 2r applies, and only to personal damage, not your camp.

I’ve wanted something like this for a while now. 
---
What’s sad is I wanted it because I remember playing Runescape as a kid and it had one.  The market was abuzz with over a hundred players huddled around the tellers setting up buy/sell orders, just like a stock exchange. 
---
I’d like to see something like this, at the very least, for junk items, ammo, and plans.  Have a spot on their website for the current going rate of each item on each platform based on the average of the last x number of sales. This value would also appear on screen whenever setting up a buy/sell order so you know whether you’re in line with current market values or not. THIS CANT BE DONE UNTIL THE DUPERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF THOUGH. 
---
If a browser based MMO could do this 10-15 years ago, Bethesda can surely figure it out. 
---
I found it comical. Pretty dead on accurate of the DMV.
---
3 months including beta isn't really eons. Could be due to a fundamental coding issue that is difficult to fix.
---
That would take a ridiculous amount of time, IF you even find him
---
Hold on. Master checking in, I’m on a mid range PC and I have not have many bugs or disconnects. No complains from me. I actually thought the console experience was worse both in terms of stability and community. Glad to hear it’s not the case.  Keep on rebuilding. And never mind the down votes. You can come on here saying  2+2=4 and get downvoted to oblivion.
---
The fact that the last patch broke so many things and nerfed White Knight and Demolition Expert out of nowhere was sort of the last straw for a lot of people. And 3 month or not, this has been a legendarily bad launch for a triple A studio.
---
&gt; uninstall the game to send a tangible message the bosses can understand.  
---
 I don't have any message to send. I'm not pissed off about someone else's duped weapon getting nerfed or armor that I don't wear breaking too fast. 
---
lol!  Upvoted!
---
&gt; This sub is super toxic and whiny. Just play it and form your own opinion. Some people make valid criticism but a lot are just super dramatic about everything.
---
It's crazy to think that people are saying this about the sub that was created to be a circlejerk after /r/fallout hated this game.
---
Like fallout 76 has had to try 3 different times to find sub that doesn't see it as terrible. I don't think it's possible for their to be a fourth sub, because these subs keep getting smaller and smaller.
---
Yeah DMV quest was up there for me. Along with the Firemans fitness test and the Military's obstacle course. 
---
The whole quest was supposed to be a sardonic joke. But if you didn't get it you haven't had to deal with government or the state services or local services before. It's just a prank bro. 
---
I completely agree. Maybe that is the true end game.
---
this. best quest currently in-game OP
---
If you want what it’ll be in November 2019, come back in November 2019. Dev hasn’t stopped because it was release. 
---
I (and other like me) want it now. 
---
Even buggy. 
---
And we actually celebrate having a chance to put feedback in before the core design is closed off for good, like it already was in F4 the day it was released. 
---
Just because of your preference we shouldn’t have a game for a year? 
---
How about go find a cliff and walk off it?
---
LOL good point :D
---
Agreed!
---
Don't let it bother you. I don't want you attacking someone for wearing a hat
---
Who the fuck said I was excusing anything. I just can't comprehend why you people are using a feature designed almost expressly as a means of selling scrap to vendors as an incredibly ineffective means of saving on carry weight and throwing away plastic. 
---
Mine is working fine on PC

Hope your crime solving is better than your spelling.  Jesus....
---
Well given this sub is actually more active then the official forums, I would say this community has a much bigger say than most. Also last I checked the game had, what? 1.8 millions units total? So this subreddit is nearly 10% of the entirety of sales? I would sale that is pretty impressive. 
---
I get that your trying to say that the constant bashing on reddit does no good, but I would argue the exact opposite, we actually get developer response when we rally, many of the suggestion and fixes that have been implemented into the game originated from the non stop bitching from this sub. 
---
And while I will say that this sub is *not* the majority of the player base, it is a hefty sum who are dedicated to trying to find the good game hidden in this mess and most likely the largest active fo76 community. 
---
You really gonna blame them over bethseda for this shit? Lmao wow
---
Don't even get me started on the lack of a refrigerator for my C.A.M.P. There are refrigerators in most of the houses in Appalachia! Why can't I just take one of them?! RUINED FOREVER!!!!
---
I loved the DMV quest line.  My favorite part was, at least for me, when the ghoul that had the previous number rushed in the room and got a blast from my combat shotgun right to the face. Priceless moment.
---
That is exactly what I was thinking. 
---
Appears some haters believe people should not play games and have fun, or at least others should not have fun in order to influence behaviors of developers.
---
I never used any of these broken builds and i have zero trouble with scorchbeasts. I solod 3 at once with excavator and a lever action.
---
P.s. 
---
Melee was never broken . It's a little overpowered. 
---
If I bought it directly I would definitely consider it. I got it from a store though, so it's not their fault or responsibility that the product wasn't up to standard, and has slipped even further in my opinion below the standard I expect from a game.
---
I have the same problem and no mods
---
You never get plastic back from scrapping bulk items, which is why it's extra stupid to use bulking on the vast majority of materials for storage instead of for vendoring. 
---
Bethesda knew duping was in the game before it came out. They didn’t think it was a big deal. I know because I know people at Bethesda Austin and Bethesda Maryland.
---
It became a big deal because of YouTube Videos and people selling stuff on EBay and Fiver and other sites. And after a backlash of players a started complaining about it. Then they started to try to patch it and have videos took down. It became an issue and important issue to them then. After Youtubers and Game Websites Did articles on Duping.
---
These are facts and thought you should know more about thoughts behind the scene. They actually allowed duping for a while. They thought it was helping the game some.
---
Why do you think not every duper has been banned?
---
Found the flat earther.
---
What is your build?
---
Ps4 no trouble here.
---
Yeah now get your refunds and get off my MURICAN soil! You damn commies! 
---
Hey by all means have fun. Youre getting enough out of it. Im fed up. I'm certainly not alone in my disappointment. The game is complete shit to me. 
---
Add the flooded train yard to the east of watoga to your loop. There's a good probability of legendary and even some 3* legendaries along with a spawn point for marine plans of many types, a magazine spawn and 2 recipe spawns, then the drop site just south of there has a spawn chance for t-60 mod plans and the crashed vertibird in between has a t-60 mod that can spawn on a crate
---
I've had at least 10 Gatling lasers drop for me. Are they really that rare? I've been scrapping them.
---
I don't disagree that 25% is a ton of damage. Even at 25% it's around 4 times what my .308 machined sniper rifle will do. However, given it's really slow to reload, the black powder rifle isn't all that much dps given I can reload my .308 a heck of a lot faster. I'd even say I could out dps my black powder rifle with my .308 given its slow reloading time. So essentially, they nerfed my endgame weapon under what I can craft. I don't know if that's the way it was meant to be. I can still kill shit, same as before.
---
I agree, that more balancing should have been considered. This is their first foray into multiplayer, so they're in new territory. We have to give them some leeway in that arena. Some will say that they should have considered this going into it. Or perhaps caught this during the beta. From what I've read, it sounds as if not much of the feedback from the beta influenced changes in the game. I don't know how true that is.
---
At this point, I just want them to address the glaring issues. Broken events and mechanics. Then give serious thought to rebalancing weapons. I don't know how much new content they have planned or even if that will include harder mobs. New content might help a bit, but if the issues aren't addressed soon, I'm afraid the community will just wither away.
---
That is a horrible example..
---
You can find the plans in the wild. They spawn at the same places as other marine armor plans.
---
Says the man with the communist china flair.
---
It happens on xbox also.  
---
Ja sit kun joutuu ilman marsupialia hyppiä ni ei pääse ees pikku kivien yli
---
Well I agree, though still it is necessary to point out that it is different when game is running smoothly or if there are problems (mostly those two states makes difference in what kind of posters make their posts), also is needed to say that those who have 500+ hours in gameplay have lots of time to play, so also have lots of time to post or comment, those who don't have so much time are posting only when necessity calls out (for first two months I did not even know BGS posted times of updates on twitter or forums or elsewhere) and finally, it's also about simple fact that those who scream most are first to be heard (I can talk about this way more, but I don't want to bore anybody or get entangled in political, social or whatever speech, because you know, those are very tightly tied together). 
---
Oh, also I forgot to mention that it is very different if poster bought this game when beta was out or if somebody bought it just recently and will never find out what the hell those oldtimers are talking about or what different problems are there.
---
What I wanted to say, it is nice to write texts like this, but in the end nothing much will change and it is no problem at all, though it is necessary to write that bethesda have to choose what to listen and what not, because they are those who may appease one group while angering second one, it is their call to do what they think is right because in the end angry mob will chase bethesda not anybody else.
---
&gt; From all the bugs they brought back in the game,
---
What bugs did they "bring back in the game" other than bobby pin weight?
---
Their out to to the gaming world was a big reverse update that sent the game back 3 steps, a big "F U", and Todd Howard telling you to buy Skyrim again.
---
You might, i dunno... Ignore it? I was a die hard fan of Bethesda. This game ruined my confidence in them
---
Niinpä. Healing factor ei healaa mut se liittynee bugiin ku status caution koko ajan
---
I honestly said this before the game dropped lol
---
Hyvin menee taas 
---
This is not what chargebacks are designed for and you can get hit with all kinds of problems misusing them like this.
---
MAGA. Take note fellow patriots. The left feels pretty bold on this sub
---
Knock Knock
---
FF14 had this issue at relaunch, they eventually added timers to the FATES on the maps.
---
Old bug just need to login off and back on bro
---
I agree the DMV quest is most accurate depiction of any real life interaction. 
---
&gt; I'm sure the intern tried *their* best.
---
Not, what I'm doing is pointing out that it's fucking stupid in the first place to be lugging around random bulked scrap. If you're not selling it within a minute of it hitting your inventory then you're burning plastic so you can save on a fraction of a fraction of your carry weight all while risking losing it all the next time you die anyway. 
---
Fuck em. Spiderman and rdr2 are fantastic 
---
I’ve tried doing a few different variations of that. I’d remove the first fence and it wouldn’t work, then I would do the same thing on the other side. I’ve even tried placing the gate first and I still can’t get anything to snap on. Not sure what’s going on exactly. 
---
Shhh. The glorious nation of Mama dulces food processing factory of the glorious nation of the people's republic of china will bury you for this! 
---
Nah just incompetence on every level of development.
---
The combat helmet with BoS paint and a gas mask looks pretty close also.  I tend to rock that or the helmet with the aviator shades and my hunters long coat.
---
IDK what you're talking about. Ever picked up a bobby pin?! They weigh a ton! 0/10 Bugthesda can't even get a bobby pin right! /s
---
Did you play with headsets so you could talk?
---
Nah man great quest, didn’t think they’d be able to make a post apocalyptic game so realistic. just having a laff
---
Especially ps4 players should realize this. Any time you get an achievement trophy on PSN, it tells you what percentage of other players have earned the same trophy. We don't all play at the same rate.
---
People say they quit but they aren’t, trust me!
---
that doesn't circumvent his whole point though, why the fuck are they autoscrapping bulk items? It's irrelevant why they are carrying it around it shouldn't be doing that in the first place. You're blaming someone for a point that is irrelevant, it shouldn't work that way.
---
If that were true then scrap-all would scrap mods.  Does it?
---
all of the " uh uh uh I didn't mean quitting, quitting"
---
Because Bethesda's incompetent? 
---
&gt; the 171,000 people on this subreddit are not a representative sample of FO76 players. This sub is a tiny, a teeny-tiny percent of everybody that plays the game 
---
171,000 people is not a small number, and it sure as hell don't represent the "tiny" percent of people who played this game. In fact, I would say the number of people who still play this game is a teeny tiny percent of those who are in this sub.
---
It is delusional of you to not realize that this game would have been way more of a shameless, broken cash grab, if it's not for the combined voices of the people who are concerned with the problems of the game.
---
Why would you do that?
---

Made a while post about it more updated then this one.
---
Yes. My dream of opening a restaurant might be realized.

You poor soul ^^
---
&gt;I've had at least 10 Gatling lasers drop for me. Are they really that rare?
---
I was talking about the ULTRACITE GATLING LASER.  I forgot to include the ultracite in my original post. 
---
With the ultracite Gatling laser,  the plans have to drop as a reward for an event. Then you have to get the materials and build it (some of them rare). 
---
And, once again, it was touted as a unique, end game weapon. 
---
And it's crap.
---
I am from the USA, and seems some people do not comprehend sarcasm.
---
According to the consumer protection commission:  
---
"You may want to dispute a card transaction if:
---
* The transaction was not authorised by you, or was put through more than once
---
* The supplier did not deliver the goods or services you paid for
---
* The goods were delivered to you but were faulty or not as described"
---
Seems to me like someone could make a fairly good case in regards to 76 on the last two points, especially with Bethesda's "If you click the install button, no refunds." policy.
---
Your taking this to the extreme, but that's your right.  You are obviously trying to use a mule character to get around stash limits.   They really don't like this behavior and you could get banned.    But they just implemented a max limit on characters so this aspect might not have any relevance to you at all anymore.   So you probably will never see a ban at all because they stopped the 2k+ mules.
---
I’ve played everyday since beta, but get blue screens (PS4) every 10-15 mins, and it’s been really grinding on me. 
---
Then I discovered this post yesterday, took the mod off and have been playing for hours with no crashes! 
---
Thank you so much you clever modders!
---
i personally do think the TSE nerf was a bit heavy handed, i could understand nerfing the E portion, but not the TS. most of them already have an accuracy penalty. just make the ones that are not single shot (aka sniper rifles) have a larger spread (except for the .50 cal.. that needs to be toned back) nerfing the explosive perk badly impacts regular explosive weapons like missile launchers, fatman, and both grenade launchers. and also makes some grenades less useful
---
&gt;!though, all they really had to do was fix bobble head stacking, and maybe lower the explosive damage on the legendary prefix from +100% to only +50%.  then see if they needed more adjustments after the fix.!&lt;

Ah...cheers - long day yesterday, didn’t even think to check the obvious. Will see how it is tonight.
---
As I said it can be fun and if people find fun in it good for them, that's the point. I enjoy playing it with my friends. 
---
However even if someone finds it personally fun or sinks thousands if hours into it that doesn't make it a great game by most the standards games are measured on. 
---
The fact this is a debate that happens so often clearly shows it's not great enough to be overwhelmingly  loved. 
---
You prefer scrapping mods to this minor inconvenience?
---
Before -- lose a mod to crafting.
---
Now -- lose 2 plastic if you hit scrap all while carrying bulked mats.
---
Deep pocketed armor?
---
If something you bought isn't what you thought it was. Like a functional working polished game for AAA price. I think you have a good case for getting your money back one way or another. A lot of countries have pretty good consumer rights.
---
This was obvious. Hell, in the description to Fallout 3 dictates that it's "Made by Vault-Tec" to serve as a simulation of what the outside world would be. Why they would include the fact that they are running experiments in their own Vaults, and various Vaults completely failing, I have no clue.
---
You are so wrong.
---
That's awesome!
---
All good I’ve had it happen a few times now. Hey at least easy fix.
---
You got lucky.  I got a response from customer support that said "We have no tools available to help you".
---
I did get the novice holotape and I can listen to it a thousand times.  However, when it directs me to log into crypto, I cannot.  The screen is blank every single time.
---
I believe it was closed testing right now, not sure on any full details. If you Google Skyrim Together you should get some info. 
---
Get rekt
---
I see, thank you.

Sounds legit...

They let us know on Twitter, the Bethesda.net launcher, Bethesda.net, Facebook, and here on Reddit.  Unfortunately for a fix like this one we never get a lot of warning.

---
My post is not about what Bethesda did or did not do. It is about education of the law. The terms of service clearly states this. Nothing above has anything to do with state or federal laws. Example: If a cop lets 3 people pass him speeding but stops the 4th person, the 4th person can not say "Well you let the first 3 do it." Doesn't matter. The 4th person was caught.
---
Okay, everything you say may be true, but you realize you're one "Todd Howard HATES this guy!" from the clickbait-iest title line ever, right?
---
I love fallout, but I’m learning I hate fellow fallout fans. They are selfish and want an experience catered to them rather than shared with a community 
---
Extreme? It's a legitimate question based on game boundaries and bannable offences that should be questioned due to ToC grey areas. Should I get a fucking lawyer so I can play a game? You have no idea, as you say "probably". You're as in the dark a I am...
---
Please, don't add conjecture to legitimate questions. Not only are you part of the problem and anti-consumer, you're willingly trying to mislead fellow gamers with your bullshit.
---
Except true casual players like me abandonded the game months ago because it is a boring grindfest. I check sometimes if they added new content, but thats it. The 80% of game is divided into 2 parts: kill generic boring basic enemies + skyrim dragons and explore generic locations filled with generic loot and generic texts from people who are obviously bad at writing. And each of these is made even more frustrating by bad gunplay and bad ui. The people who continue to play this contentless grindfest arent casuals. They are full blown autists.
---
I'm sorry but I'll deff be buying elder scrolls 6 
---
That's how fallout 76 works 
---
Yeah, you're not kidding when you say it breaks quickly. I had regular gatling laser drop from a SBQ with practically full condition bar. I used it on my next fight with a SBQ. It broke before the fight was even over. Are there any perk cards that could help make it last longer? Seems a bit strange it would break so easily. What if you equipped the perk card that give you a chance for your weapons to repair themselves after a successful hit?
---
Flatwoods would be perfect, outside the church, open road, red rocket and a vendor nearby, newbies go there right away for the first responders quests, plenty of Brahmin around a steak feast! 
---
This a whole new level of butt hurt whining that's for sure.
---
&gt; I just dont see the problem with people who think TSE's being next to worthless now 
---
You don't see it because it isn't true. '
---
I use a Gatling gun quite a bit.
---
The base damage is 132 per shot.  I cant kill scorch beasts solo with it. 
---
There's a youtuber who thinks his two-shot explosive Gatling is  worthless because it now does 319 damage (instead of 1018). 
---
He's seriously thinking of giving up guns completely and going strictly melee because of this.   
---
I'm not kidding. 
---
Vid is below.

If they change the event icon color from just yellow to Green, yellow, red depending on how much longer it had it would solve the problem without timers.
---
FO76 is coming to Nintendo Switch in May too OP, I know because of my uncle
---
I also never use power armor and I have a great time in the blast zone. The hazmat suit and some resonable perk choice make it pretty to go gallivanting around. If you're not careful you can get into a rough situation but death doesn't really matter in this game does it?
---
I have heard of no plans to bring FO76 to the Switch. I’m sorry.
---
Wait what? Did you forget /s? Without post history your post is the toxic one. Just so you know

I wish..I might would have a large bank account then.

I think the people that make that argument are normaly tight on money I guess. I for one dont mind paying 60 bucks for even a 8 hour game as long as I enjoy it. Like you said going out to eat runs me 50-100 
---
Bethesdacoin's value hit 0.1 dollar today but has now been patched down to 0.001
---
Kyllä tässä mennään aina yks askel eteen ja kaks taakse jokasen patchin jälkeen
---
I agree with everything you said sure.   I think someone did the numbers on the TSE and seemed the explosive got doubled due to the two shot.  It counted on both shots.  Thus it was easily 300% damage, it was already overpowered at this point.
---
Melee weapons themselves are not overpowered on the items, its the perks that did that.   I believe they will address this eventually once the current exploiting situation is under control.  I think the TSE got so much attention because of the exploitation.  Melee weapons are not really being exploited.   They are all doing legit, its just they are a bit OP.
---
Never used bloodied but there is greater risk to using those I guess?  
---
Given enough time, I think they will eventually make the obviously OP items reeled back some.
---
Some loon downvoted you, for not expressing an appropriate level of outrage I guess.
---
That’s a pretty solid idea actually 
---
Are you on PS4? Do you use either excavator or T-51b power armour? If so, let me know and I'll fix you up with calibrated shocks so you'll have another 100 lbs of carry-weight. I've got those two sets of plans now, and as long as you have the materials, I'm happy to put them to use for you.
---
At the very least I know if I use an old version of a spreadsheet, I have to fix all the mistakes in the old version and not just test out the new changes and overwrite the updated version with some ass Frankenstein old version. 
---
Lol the people who played the game more see the flaws more, that's just logical. You're just praising people for not playing the game long enough to understand what it actually is haha. Trust me you can play this game casually for a very low number of hours and still see the flaws in it :)
---
DDOS'ing the shadiest cult on the planet that stalks/sues/blackmails its former members or anyone that speaks out against them... And your comparing that to duping... Great job junior detective but its past your bed time, don't let your fanfiction fantasy run too wild.
---
Melee is also op because melee is the only combat style that gains direct damage from a special stat. Str increases damage of melee directly as well as the perks, where perception doesn’t effect rifles, agility doesn’t effect pistols, etc. it’s also why unyielding armor is so much stronger for just melee rather then for people who use guns. 
---
Harper's Ferry.  After fast traveling find the building with a big hole in the wall. The display cases in that building sometimes have marine armor plans and sometimes Trevor armor plans. You'll have to go through the building jump on the car to the right and then up through the train car to get to the upper floors. Sometimes you find recipes. Sometimes you find armor piece plans. There's a huge random element to it.
---
Thanks for the post OP. Alternate perspective is always useful and I think this one is healthy and helpful.
---
Hope people will cool down a bit.
---
Downvoted by someone for expressing an insufficient level of outrage.
---
Downvoted.. Hilarious.  
---
I'll buy all 3 
---
What a joke of a comment. 
---
Nerfing perk cards that take TEN levels to acquire is hardly casual player friendly  (repair perks). 
---
I haven't played this game in around a month now, but I can say I would flip my shit if you took about a week's worth of gameplay levels and nerfed it to the ground. (I gained a level or two a day, hardly a hardcore player).
---
Bethesda ALMOST got me to come back when they ended duping and nerfed tse. Then this patch happened. Duping is back, and they are going to figure out what the new fad weapon is, and make bank. Bethesda will again have to nerf yet more legendaries, hurting casual players even more.
---
People like you making excuses for Bethesda are pure cancer to the gaming community. As much as I can't stand min-maxing exploiters, at least they know how to put a company in its place.
---
But you do you.
---
Bethesda isn’t an Asian company
---
You can't stack it anymore though...
---
Don’t worry you weren’t missing out White Knight was so over the top busted you didn’t even need to keep it equipped. Just throw it on every time you’re repairing your gear and it’s 1 unit of everything. Like five seconds of hunting junk. 
---
I remember seeing a perk that says "Increase run speed by x% while having pistol equipped".   3 ranks of that perk.  "Gun Runner" I think its what it is called.
---
The point is you're turning your power armor gauntlets into unarmed weapons.
---
If you don’t support a game they won’t fix it. If you don’t point things out, they won’t pay attention to it.
---
You the real MVP. This is what I think all the time in every game I play. As I get older I just don't even bother listening to the rage because it becomes more and more far-fetched. I have real life commitments that come first (my Fiancé and work) and my character is only level 15(?). I'm excited to get higher and explore but I'm also kind of glad knowing that by the time I get there it will actually be a really great and stable game. Your point about the 760 is hilarious btw.
---
Honestly those plans is the least of all problems, at least we don't have to server hop for hours in order to actually find them. 
---
It just works. 
---
Seriously, this is a "major glitch" for you?  It's annoying for some people but compared to some of the other bugs how can you call it a "major glitch".
---
176 hours currently on PS4 
---
Only problems I've had is the odd server disconnects and a couple blue screen crashes 
---
I haven't experienced anything as bad as what the general community is talking about 
---
That being said though my friend also got it on PS4 and had a lot more problems then I ever did 
---
Wait, is the front of the camp angled? How?
---
I feel you described me in a paragraph.... im the level 26 who plays too casually
---
Not so much about griefing as turrets won’t attack you.
---
But they will attack any ghoul and whatnot in the area (in the clubhouse) -&gt; free XP and free loot while they re doing something else somewhere else.
---
Fuck
---
Well I guess nobody told him that perk was nerfed. 
---
It. Is. A. Video. Game
---
At this point apparently make the same game over and over repeatedly. 
---
I have to ask and I’m surprised that nobody has asked yet, internally how is Bethesda doing with such bad backlash and hate? Do they really care? 
---
Under armor perhaps go into PA naked and test carry weight.
---
Hmm I have read similar posts about something to do with PVP then they doing melee and finally 1 shotting.
---
Is there some explotation/bug thing going on with the PVP-Melee-Shooting event thing?
---
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
I get your point.
---
nope, maybe theyll re-fuck up that one on the next hotfix which fixes this hotfix
---
You already wasted the plastic bulking it.
---
It would be interesting to see if those rooms exist within the games files still.
---
PA has it's own carry stats and is maxed out at 350. You can alternatively increase this through Drugs/food buffs. 
---
Well, join /r/factorio then. Good people. Best game.
---
You just need a dense or padded torso mod and you're good. Your build's much stronger than mine and I kill scorchbeasts for fun.
---
Might want a dps rifle for when they land though. Anti-armor handmade is good.
---
If Bethesda was still selling it at max price (vs the retailers), it'd be a loss of sales and probably more PR backlash.  There are two main reasons it dropped in price quickly. Firstly was that sellers were expecting copies to basically leave the store as soon as put them on the shelf, but clearly this was the complete opposite with the initial reviews and secondly, the new year was meant to kick off with some new release games like Anthem. 
---
I see.  I do recommend going more toward powerfist or deathclaw gauntlet if going that direction.. The mole miner is like 20 lbs or something crazy.  I think there is the order of mysteries sword which is better than Black Diamond.  My Order of Of Mysteries quests is bugged, so i cannot do that.
---
Those items from that quest can be re-crafted into higher versions of the items if you have the original items.
---
Well said 
---
Behind the scenes at Bethesda Austin is very stressful and people’s job are on the line. Some people is or about to be let go. They are doing a lot of hiring.
---
+karma 
---
God I fucking hate self righteous entitled asswipes like you. This isn't customer service's fault, speak to them nicely, like a human would. 
---
"Please and thank you"
---
And I think would look really neat too.
---
If casual is 2-4 hours a night... what’s about 2 hours a week?
---
Get yourself a set of either sentinel gear or go hard in on sneak/muffled/shadowed gear carrying very low weight with only silenced weapons. Nothing will ever find you.  Maybe the sandman perk for those sweet 3.5x crits and you should be fine bud
---
They Care... But feel overwhelmed.
---
Lmao. Now why would telling someone to go join r/76fithyCasuals get down voted? It's a sub where you can discuss fun aspects of the game without getting slimed. Great folks, great Mods. Just more proof of the toxic level of this sub...
---
Honestly I bought my TSE Gatling it from the Fallout Network market, at a price of around 15K caps. This is why i'm so salty about this change, because I still had to farm those caps for a damn week and then they just completely demolish what I bought (Bear in mind, I was perfectly OK with the idea of TSE weapons being nerfed, what it's not ok is that they were nerfed that much). 
---
Now I have to spend that amount of caps again (Since I don't seem to get any kind of luck with the terrible loot tables anyway) for a melee build which will be soon nerfed to the ground as well. 
---
Hi were you ever able to figure this out? Or did you give up? 
---
Still though, a lot of things are on Google. I played Scrabble once and it turned out their reference for acceptable words was whether it shows up on Google. You can imagine, that impressed me.
---
If you feel bad, there's always next time to "make it right" so to speak, just look to the future. As for counterplay against the scorch beast, a set of power armor and a minigun should take care of him right quick!
---
But yeah this game is a major pos, scorch beast aoe spam is disgusting in terms of game design.
---
The voice acting was on point, excellent stuff.
---
People unaware of how the world works.
---
That would be so meta &amp; cool!
---
just wow
---
Interesting.  But does the invisibility actually help?  I have been aggroed while I am invisible all the time.  Sneak rank 3 perk seems to work a whole lot better.  I guess the invisible is good for PVP?
---
How is any of that proof exactly? Oh, we wait months...
---
They are actually trying to be invisible.
---
Most do it for the damage increase, some do it to get through watoga because have not completed Mayor For a Day.  Some do it to get to the legendary guys without fighting the others.
---
Perception score on players is supposed to allow them to have better chances at seeing other hidden players.
---
I think the craziest thing is people are still playing this game.
---
I never said that you dunce. Fucking read what I wrote again.
---
But its not perm right
---
They're trying to convince people to boycott but people did that when ESO released as a generic MMO and now that's one of the largest in the market? It doesn't work because the game is enjoyable to at least a large portion of the players. Just Google "boycott ESO" you get results from like 2014 titled 'Boycott and Resist'. Nerds have always been used drama to try to influence companies and it rarely works the way they want it to
---
The whole point about jumping on a bandwagon is to be seen jumping on a bandwagon.  Posting your outrage is a way of demonstrating your membership of the in-group.
---
yeah and what does graham sell now? this post is a void of knowledge.
---
My friend windigos...windigos always have screws do you know where a windigo always spawns? Whitesprings golf, bottom level in the locker room...
---
Games "borrow" from each other all the time. And gamers appreciate these innovations and developments to be resued.
---
I imagine so, to be fair though they did half-ass the game and it was basically a cash grab. 
---
Yeah, but that's why I left r/fallout and came here, because it was so positive back then.
---
Now it's a wasteland.
---
Very casual FO76 player here. Diehard fallout fan. 
---
I was one of those who pre-ordered, played every single BETA, and as of now I have one character that's lvl 25 I think. Some of the bugs at launch were off putting but I knew what I was getting with the BETA. Whatever. A new Fallout game, I was psyched. After a few weeks I got bored. What did that? A few things. Random encounters, no NPCs, very small number of players for the map size, and the holotapes got a bit redundant after a month or so. I always had trouble finding someone to team up with and I couldn't get to the right half of the map by myself being such a low level, nor without help. So I've combed over the left map pretty well, however it's been a couple months and I probably have not even hit 100 hours in the game. So far no content has updated, no vaults have opened, there's no 'player town/base/trading outlet', and absolutely no way for us to truly "rebuild America". Every thing got repetitive, lonely, quite, and boring. Smothered in frustration. 
---
The only bugs that ever annoyed me was the stash limit, how PvP was set up at launch, Bobby pins weight, and my teammate going invisible on my screen but still there. 
---
Its lost it's quirky randomness, fantastic speech encounters/check and storytelling, having memorable characters, being savage/weird/horrifying/awesome in one and just... Feeling like I had an impact in the game. Every game before this you hear the world around you talk and change as you make choices, save people, kill bad things, or choose to do the opposite. Does anyone remember karma or is it just me? Even the radio changes as you progress. It's been three months, I haven't really played in a month or so, but when I logged on last week and tried to play it was simply "fear the high lvl players if they will be friendly or not, and try not to get nuked." Nothing else changed. I feel like the life has been sucked out of my favorite series and a majority of the elements that made Fallout feel like Fallout have been mostly done away with. It's now just another PvP shooter with a fallout skin. 
---
Sucks yo.  1st time I tried a launch the code reset WHILE I was in the silo.  I made it, but couldn't launch. I learned the silo though, so when I tried again it was flawless.  
---
tldr
---
My Perception is 5 though, see them a mile away :-)
---
Enter the trading screen with purifier, water often doesnt show on the quick loot screen.
---
Looks like im at 1 right now, so thats good. I feel safe suggesting it here cuz it seems hated enough that the toxic wont migrate. Its a great failsafe
---
Who would turn down that amount of plastic.
---
Shitty canvas I could do without, but sweet plastic...
---
Only problem is the super-duper types are running multiple characters and mules and all that bullshit and they'd probably try to stack the vote, such is their sense of entitlement. 
---
Well i tested and its wierd.  The excavator pa gives me 150 weight buff
---
So you don't want to hear it, basically.
---
I camp pretty far east, but always thought the area. JUST to the east of the junkyard workshop would be super nice for someone's camp.
---
I can't get the daily quest the big hunt to start even when I'm in a team and a team member gets the quest it doesn't show in my list with the other quests marked with a star. Hunterof GUNMEN ps4.
---
I wish I didn't have to say it, but I'm honestly quite tired of seeing the same negative posts over and over again.
---
At least the upvote farms crediting the devs and CMs for their work have some uplifting aspects to them. 
---
Done
---
Thank god. All I hear is complaints. I’m glad it died.
---
Eh quit out lol I think I’ll be playing Anthem for a while until I hear news about DLC’s for 76.
---
Nah
---
Do you?
---
Gunsmith  is only perk I know to make it last longer.    Gunsmith maxed out it will last maybe 5 minutes. 
---
Without gunsmith it breaks after 20 shots (okay, those are exaggerations, but you get the picture.)
---
It did allow me to pacify her but since others were shooting at her she became my enemy again.
---
The only fight in this game is surviving the nerf hammer. Like all fallout games it was always about loot. Now it's about what loot wont get the ban hammer. 
---
Bethesda devs are famously incompetent, it's the main reason why 76 wasn't anticipated favorably in gaming circles. 
---
  Obviously, junior, you are not understanding. A DDOS and a DOS attack are two different things. Look it up. Similar not the same. You have an opinion and that is cool. I know how cyber-crimes are investigated and tried.
---
If this post upsets you, sorry. I just hate to see people get in real trouble for something they did not realize.
---
And yes I have my junior detective badge in cyber security.
---
So Bethsada just thought this up independently? Borrow? As in steal? I was enjoying the game until the last patch broke it.
---
Pretty sure the map icons were used even before Far Cry games. Scouting (revealing) areas from watchtowers/mountain tops only logical and not unique to Far Cry either.
---
That's alright.
---
Its is behind in terms of content update, since the base game had comparably less content overal than fallout 4. It also has way more bugs and playability issues.
---
Im a die hard Fallout fan, but i play the fallout games casually, i dont min max, i hate grinding, and i just like to play the game however the fuck i want. Im the epitome of casual gamer and i agree with your post, since im am super disappointed with 76.
---
From the first day of the PC beta, i just hoped for some bugfixes that actually make the game playable and not a broken mess, but i gave them the benefit of the doubt. After the first 2 weeks of realy play, i played 2-3h a day, thats casual play time compared and i already had barely anything left to do. Just to reiterate, thats around 35h plus 10h from the pc Beta, so 45h.
---
Compare that to Fallout 4 which i played for about 150h before i noticed a lack of stuff to do.
---
From that day on i just waited for content additions or atleast balance changes, but they never came. A months after release i stopped playing because the weight economy sucks, you rarely get any kind of legendary thats even decent since most are so random and a lot of weapons were either bugged or not really viable that you didnt get anything in the end thats worthwhile.
---
Since then i followed the patch notes and news about 76 and i have to say, its extremely disappointing.
---
I mean nerf over nerf over nerf... why not leave stuff as it is and go with buffs and balance changes, that dont invalidate certain builds before they even create more options....
---
Making shit weaker, where most of the shit is already weak and only a niche of builds works well is a horrible horrible approach... i would have rather seen they make more stuff viable before they nerf stuff like double shot explosives, than what they did.
---
And i say that as someone that has never seen a double shot, explosive or double shot explosive in their 76 life at all.
---
People arent crying because they are high frequency gamers or "hardcore" as you like to suggest, they are crying because this shit is horrible and Bethesda has never fucked up this much and so regularly as with 76.
---
Look at my username... i created this account around the release of Fallout 4, im a huge Fallout and Elder Scrolls fan and Bethesda fanboy, i spend thousands of hours (over 5k) in all of ther latest 4 or 5 installments of these two series' and they got even me to lose faith and dont give a shit any more...
---
I dont say everyone is like me, but as someone that defended not only 76 but basically any fallout since their releases and sometimes even before, even i cant shut my eyes and pretend everything will be fine ...
---
Can you pickpocket things into other players pockets yet?
---
Sure would be nice if pickpocketing a frag grenade into their pockets would make that grenade owned by them in the brief moment before it goes off and pisses off the vendor..
---
Same I got the game 2 weeks from launch and just got to level 30 and every single complaint in this sub, the main fallout sub, and some youtubers completely affect me as well. The game feels like a second job at times. I am constantly trying to balance my inventory, stash, and trying to keep ammo while bullet sponge enemies just fuck my ass and ammo. 
---
I really am not attacking OP but I don't understand what they are saying. I am pretty casual and finally had to quit the game from all the frustrations from bugs, game design, some things just breaking and etc etc. I refuse to believe other more casual players are happily enjoying themselves because they aren't level 100. The game sadly has fundamental issues with both bugs and game designs.
---
&gt; I can tell you from experience and getting griefed out of thousands of caps that bobblehead stacking is broken.
---
Was broken.  Now fixed.
---
I never said anything about map icons. The mechanics are identical to Far Cry
---
I see.   Well could be they are using the default sneak without the sneak perk equipped.   I also have camo mutation and camo armor so I know I do turn invisible all the time.   But its my sneak rank 3 skill and other stealth damage perks that are the real useful abilities vs PVE mobs.
---
Just saying... I preordered the game and have one character who is level 18.  Fallout 76 is not my life but I do like to play it. 
---
Not only the price raise, but also that you still cant sell everything off and only get 20% of the cap price back when you sell something you bought is ridiculous...
---
The whole system just gets worse with every patch.
---
I get 1 or 2 empty slots still, if I (on PC) press C to replace a favourite another cell goes blank I have to re-select that one, after a few whack-a-mole reselects I get them sorted out. Problem comes back after a restart.
---
I hear ya I literally unsubscribed because of all the whining and drama queens and just loaded it back up a few hours ago
---
I agree.. but I got to delete post friend at Bethesda ask me to.
---
You'd have to have IQ in double digits to pass the DMV quest bit. Put some points in INT and keep trying.
---
To be fair, people have been asking for a melee nerf since the beta before anyone had a TSE weapon. It was the first broken build.
---
Months before any new content? 
---
Haha .. next! 
---
Wow. Thanks, that's why I now have the atom shop logo on my PA Frame, even without buying anything for PA in Atom Shop...
---
You need to eat more GMO soya beans.
---
If someone’s “bullshit story”, as you put it, isn’t them relaying opinion then what is it? Perhaps gather the point I’m making.
---
I agree. After the disastrous campaign in Fallout 4 to basically musical holotapes, I can't see myself really getting invested in the game unless it goes F2P. There's literally NO roleplaying elements. No human NPCs. And worst of all, Obsidian didn't make it. Kind of hard to buy after  (My dad left the vault on some random quest to purify the Wasteland's water supply and I have to hunt him down and begrudgingly help him whether I want to or not because plot. (Fallout 3) (to) (My spouse has been killed in the first 20-30 minutes by a cyborg, my son taken by a shadowy organization and I must find him all the while rebuilding the Commonwealth to find out he is the leader of said organization and dies of cancer regardless of what I do.) (Fallout 4) 
---
So why should I be exited to pick up a  game with a campaign as riveting as watching paint dry? (I've watched lore videos about 76, not really interested. Seems like a waste of time, money, and potential after being spoiled by New Vegas and its DLCs. ♡)
---
No it isn't. You just walk up a ledge and press a button. Another version of this mechanic is to use a pair of binoculars to "tag" the locations. Which game would that be stealing from then?
---
Was it nuked?
---
Not really certain if you are upset because someone called you out on using a mule or genuinely upset about comments posted?
---
Don't play the game if you do not want to, but no one besides Bethesda themselves is going to be able to give you the answer you want.  You want a true/false answer and no player can give that to you.  So do not even know why you would post in a forum targeting players.
---
Try opening a ticket with Bethesda and ask them.
---
Where's my check god dammit...
---
Are you dreaming? Ledge?
---
I keep checking the post box but I keep finding junk mail and Pizza Delivery menus :(
---
I agree with most of your comments. This Reddit doesn't really reflect the typical gamer experience and there is a bizarre sense of entitlement, reflected here, from the hard-core gamers who consider Bethesda should be focusing on keeping them happy - even when they break the rules (apparently putting strain on the servers, I gather) and insist on causing problems for average gamers and demanding the focus be on PvP, in order to maximise their own enjoyment. It's a bit messy and empty and Bethesda has dropped the ball a lot but I still like it. I'm still playing. There must be a reason for that.  
---
How can you be sure about your opinion actually represent ‘the majority players’?
---
I only see bullshit in your post. Anyone with half brain working knows a simple fact: Paid the top money, want top game.
---
Not a highschool development team who barely know about version control.
---
&gt; Bethesda knew duping was in the game before it came out. They didn’t think it was a big deal. I know because I know people at Bethesda Austin and Bethesda Maryland.
---
What, praytell, was their initial reaction?
---
&gt; It became a big deal because of YouTube Videos and people selling stuff on EBay and Fiver and other sites. And after a backlash of players a started complaining about it. Then they started to try to patch it and have videos took down. It became an issue and important issue to them then. After Youtubers and Game Websites Did articles on Duping.
---
&gt; These are facts and thought you should know more about thoughts behind the scene. They actually allowed duping for a while. They thought it was helping the game some.
---
LOL, they thought it was helping?  Doubtful.
---
&gt; Why do you think not every duper has been banned?
---
&gt; They also Know dupers duped everything. Not just TSE Weapons. They Sold Melee and Armor and aids in just as much.
---
&gt; Also to prove I have sources.
---
&gt; PVP Severs and Raid was supper to be out by end of February beginning of March.
---
That's not a source.  That's simply a rumor.  A source would have to be a name.
---
In any event, end of February is too late.  Mid-Feb there are other games being released.  They need to release this in 2 weeks.
---
&gt; First DLC supposed to come out May or June and bring Raider Enemies to the game. NPC’s to get missions from. At end of DLC you would get a chance to Join Raider Faction. That’s why you did Rose’s missions is to call Raiders back to West Virginia.
---
&gt; Expansion was supposed to come out October or November. It was about Enclave and BrotherHood Of Steel. At the end of the Expansions you chose a faction side if you haven’t joined the Raiders yet.
---
If these expansions are as you've described, then we have something epic to look forward to.
---
&gt; Shortly After Expansion the Base Game Of Fallout76 was going free to Play.
---
&gt;
---
Not a far stretch to predict that a year after release, the game goes F2P.
---
No need to reply.
---
Yes, but theres no way for me to know how many players quit. I know that the stats are not reliable.
---
I tried to play with your .ini tweaks but am not able to reach 60fps most of the time :( What CPU do you have?
---
Do both I did, works every time ;)
---
No one besides Bethesda..yet here you are giving an opinion. I'm asking for an official response. If you don't understand that simple statement, don't reply. Bethesda are on these forums. You are not Bethesda. Simple, even for you.
---
Ok Todd
---
Yes, I'd like to see what people think, good or bad. It's a video game, not my kid.
---
I have had no real problems, but I am level 7. At such a low level, I don’t even have a “build.” 
---
I play an hour or two a week. 
---
That would be so so good, I loved Dogmeat most of the time, sometimes the blocking my way was a trial.
---
Maybe a Tamed Wolf Dogmeat as they look to have survived pretty intact. I'd love me a tamed Wolf.
---
The percentage is totally in line with similar achievements in other games though. As I have shown in another comment, the tutorial or first mission achievement is not awarded for 10~20% of players for any game. 
---
The second opposite rock can be reached with marsupial alone, and their far enough apart if you and a friend want a camp on each peak:) (If someone can explain exporting the in-game photos from Xbox to imgur I'd love to show you, I built mine as well as my friends')
---
That's alright, I'm sure we can have a civil discussion. 
---
No Asteroid ;) 
---
Sell it! Oh, wait...
---
This is the thing that made you mad enough to post.
---
I still like the game
---
Sidenote: Nuclear keycard escorts often travel by and if you manage to hit the cargobot the navmesh seems to have trouble leaving and should stay within visible range from the peak 
---
Speak out against Bethsada on social media? Isn't that just what you are moaning about?
---
Nah, i blocked you, less inbox spam.
---
As I have shown in another comment, for any game the first achievement is not awarded to 10~20% of players. I dont know exactly why. It seems some people register the game to their account but never play it. But FO76s reclamation day stat is totally in line with similar achievements in other games.
---
Im not sure, its only happened the once and i assumed it was a bug relating to the fact i had been PvPing with him already, ive also had a seperate bug where i was in PvP with someone and they suddenly turned non hostile while i was attacking them so i couldnt damage them but they could damage me
---
Tried to....5 weeks ago, patience with ass wipes like yourself wears thin after a little while ;)
---
That's fair, and I do think criticism is important for a game to flourish properly. I appreciate those who spend time finding the bugs, and give suggestions as to the way the game can be improved, as well as people who bring up the issue of no endgame, bad balancing, and the nerfs to weapons being unfair for those that earn them without using exploits or buying from dupers - but I just don't see anything constructive from the same few posts that announce someone's departure over and over. 
---
It's OK, last 5 SBQ fights I have attended timed out, couldn't kill her....equally if not more annoying, gotta love those nerfs :-)
---
how hungarians says, this post is "self dick stabing"
---
because: how u will store/carry kido? when in this patch the mule system is destoryed.
---
So mule characters are a bannable offense now? Sorry to ask, had stopped playing FO76 a while ago when they messed up CAMPs, but was considering starting to play again after a friend suggested to get back in.
---
Don't tell me what to do. 
---
What's weird is that I'm getting loads of legendaries off non legendary mobs, have been for a few weeks now
---
um.. Wow.  I did not even know you could do this type of stuff.
---
Plus the design is amazing.
---
No  your right! Exceptions should be made.
---
And Bethesda shouldn't rely on one guy in one time zone to sort this mess out....they can afford more than 1 CM surely?
---
It's crazy how different the experience can be. I've had some issues in my nearly 200 hours but nothing game breaking. Hell, I'm still playing on my character from the BETA. The only quest I've had bug was the "Kill a Wendigo in a Clown Costume" one, never got stuck in power armor, only have had a handful of CTD, etc. I did have some of the CAMP items doubling, but I was able to scrap all of them and didn't end up with phantom space taken out of the budget. Really the only big annoyances I've run into in my time have been early problems with the social side (chat not working, teammates turning invisible) and "server not responding" but I haven't seen that in a little while now. 
---
Both of our experiences are real and valid and I think that's where the disconnect can come in between people that see the game as nothing but a bug laden mess and people that feel like that's blown out of proportions. The game has real problems but the severity of those varies person to person.
---
Clever and original.
---
The lack of a player hub is crazy. 
---
Like imagine Destiny without the Tower, it'd be stupid
---
Can I be called casual? I play since beta, have one 100+ char, second is 45, third is 5. I farmed few nuked whitesprings, also killed few SBQ along the way, I play mostly melee build with my 100+ because my 45 is dedicated to heavy laser, which I don't play atm for my own reasons. Now, on my 100+ char I got many legendaries, about 2-3 2Shots also 2 explosives, but never I got 2SE (that is also why I am using melee), also my explosive gatling gun was permanently lost due to dropping on ground with bag-not-appearing bug (my bad, missclicked), so now I am stuck with only explosive .44, which I use and don't feel that this nerf was in any way bad. Also I don't think that many casuals will even get their hands on solid 2SE, this is only whining about yourself, where were you when everybody was screaming that 2SE is bad? What bethesda should rather do is, to stop listening to people here, get their team time to play their game to its fullest and look for themselves how balanced it is.
---
&gt;I already opened a thread. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alney6/bug\_sneaking\_doesnt\_work\_properly\_stays\_long\_time/  
---
&gt;It is defintley bugged. I have chamelon mutation - full weightless set + weapon - 75% sneak perk - escape artist  
---
&gt;20+ AGI  
---
&gt;Enemies detect me faster. Often I can't escape by crouching and uncrouching. Stays much longer in danger mode or caution. Sometimes stays there for long times even when no enemies in sight or even there. don't hear them.. miles away.. Tested it for hours in west tek because I lvled there after the patch. Before the patch I got detected less often and the meter was moving faster. It seems to be a basic problem after the patch not only in certain areas.  
---
&gt;Also my Update to the thread. When a player is near by and hitting the same mobs sneaking and sneak attack multiplier doesn't work at all. Found out 2-3 times when another guy was around with me in west tek.  
---
&gt;UPDATE: Even worse than I thought. I've I'm around with another player against mobs which is not in my team I won't get the sneak multiplier because he is visible to the enemies. It clearly stated "CAUTION" which should add the multiplier. Tested dozen of times today on different servers at west tek.
---
FYI - If you didn't see it.
---
TL;DR I’m on PS4 and haven’t experienced anything worth quitting over.
---
I’ve had minimal issues for as long as I’ve had the game. I bought game and console (PS4) around Thanksgiving but didn’t play much till the beginning of January (Holiday season sucks for retail workers btw). I’m a level 38 and have explored a pretty decent portion of the map and have followed around some higher level friends and helped with some high level quests (BOS storyline, launched a few nukes, things of that nature).
---
The few bugs that I HAVE experienced have been odd at best (invisible players, enemies hovering in the T-pose, etc.) and mildly irritating at worst (servers crashing right after buying a Workshop, unable to fast travel due to non-existent enemies nearby, clipping into objects and getting stuck, etc.) - but even these buggy moments have been pretty rare. Me and the friends I play with usually just laugh at it, fake rage and yell things like “fix your game Bethesda” and “who let Todd Howard design a game while taking meth”... we lol a bit and then we move on with life.
---
Not sure if PS4 is why I have a better experience or if it’s just luck... but so far, my only disappointment is the lack of quality content. 
---
I am in the same category as him and I’d like to apologize on his behalf.  He made virtually the same thread as before and shows himself to have learned very little of how ignorant and disrespectful he was last time.
---
then\* I've\* then\* there's\* I've\*
---
Sometimes 
---
Still going?
---
TSE never negated slap damage, something else going on under the hood here.
---
The only thing to remember is that any player who passed those achievement milestones during the beta but haven't gone back and redone them won't have unlocked the achievement. So there'll be a small percentage of players who are far ahead in the game bit not included in the those stats.

You have to have weapons that are powerful or what's the point? They arent OP anymore, powerful yes, but not a patch on melee, about half in fact..
---
“Bethesda : Let the spankings begin” 
---
More more!!!
---
Maybe to do with all those locked Cottage doors with ghouls making noise inside, that would be neat. There are room service carts outside those to, so maybe a DLC for the future.
---
thought it was clear to everyone. i don't know the real stat but i got a glimpse of it when i used to play when achievements unlock. 
---
on ps4 trophy section, it was something like 17% never even left the vault.
---
There's a dog helmet in game. Looks like a raider helmet, but for a dog. It shows up in the apparel tab, weighs 0.1, has a mod slot, can be sold and can not be equipped.
---
Wtf is this argument?
---
&gt;you're selling it immediately afterward
---
Bulking is only possible at a ***tinker's workbench*** and most vendors have don't have one.
---
Most players bulk somewhere (C.A.M.P. or workshop) and then go to the vendors, probably even exploring on their way. Even if you fasttravel, there are stations with enemies that give you junk.
---
There is a huge incentive to scrap what you picked up. Stop making excuses. And yes that is what you are doing, blaming players for carrying around bulked junk and not the developer for fucking up.
---
BTW, PA is all but ignored in PVP, so that may explain some of it :-)
---
u/Ladydevann 
---
I saw that you go through your inbox pls check this out 
---
TSE is still one of the best combos out there, but not this good. This is something else.
---
But BOS goes on any combat armor, so theoretically you want BOS to put on a heavy chest.
---
Someone mentioned that armor mod plans that some mod plans lyou can learn by scrapping are no longer offered at vendors and that seems to be the case. I’ve been trying to find BOS Combat Armor Legs plans but they are gone. Hopping does not seem to change the plan inventories of vendors.
---
Today I scrapped combat armor and learned it! Yay. But also, shit, because it took making sooo many damn pieces of combat armor.
---
Still, I think that while they didn’t include this information in the patch notes (not surprising) I do think that this is the case that some mod plans you can learn from scrapping are no longer at vendors. Happy scrapping?
---
Test it then.  Spam craft like 50 guns and let us know.  I'm fighting for you. 
---
This scrub of a game will get you banned for playing within its boundaries. If you don't want to lose your Bethesda account, don't bug or play this game. 
---
Fanfuckbois will try and tell you otherwise, but they are the last of the cucks. Look at these forums. Pool,e are getting their Bethesda accounts banned by simply playing within the boundaries of this game. 
---
Hundreds, if not thousands of dollars being stolen from gamers working within the world. They aren't duping, cheating or exploiting. They are living (play your way: Toddy) within the box. 
---
The box is broken.
---
Pushing boundaries used to be what forwarded humanity.
---
It enhanced games.
---
Critical thinking used to be rewarded.
---
Now it gets you banned.
---
Yes siree god damn it’s like you have to plan 5 steps ahead to compensate for how much lag you have to deal with when fighting SBQ and every other ads that decide to spawn in lol 
---
Of course!!
---
Is there a “poop” card? 
---
Eat a bag of shit and get x-ray vision for 5 minutes? See what the SBQ is wearing under those knickers? 
---
Xbox one - Left Modus terminal in the armory is consistently showing as “busy” across multiple servers.
---
No, I'm complaining about the abundance of posts that declare departure and their intention to never return, and wax bombastic about how the game is trash, etc, etc.
---
Telling Bethesda the issues you had with their game is better and well done on a wider social network instead of the closed community of a Reddit sub, and I do believe it reaches the target audience more directly as well.
---
👍
---
It’s not even really the fact that it’s overpowered or anything. They’re just taking perks from fallout 4 (and adding new ones, obviously) and putting them into a multiplayer game. When it comes to PvP, this is where the perks just throw things out of proportion.
---
Then again, you only have 300-400 health or so, depending on your build. People are usually putting on rifleman or commando perks (or the shotgun perks if they have a strength build that doesn’t rely on carryweight) which make the weapons do more anyway. Plus, players do more damage than mobs, so even if you finally got enemies your level to do around 5 damage per hit, players will still do more.
---
Go do something else then.. makes no sense to waste time on here
---
Downvoting and reddit did very little to actually change things with EA. What changed things is a small number of people that did some research and contacted politicians with the information, showed up at meetings and discussed the issues with them. Politicians don't come up with plans but if you give them a working plan to solve a problem that people are vocal about and doesn't matter to them or their donors very much it is likely they will implement it.
---
Yes. Super bugged. Healing factor hasn't been working. Marsupial didn't work on one server. Speed demon definitely isn't kicking in. And it's super inconsistent and seems like it's constantly changing. This is on top of getting serendipity bonuses without having it on and I even got some other one I'd never seen before lol
---
ok whatever?
---
I'm tired of seeing posts by people who are tried of seeing posts.
---
Data mining says there are no x01 mod plans.
---
Get that from time to time, face/head missing the teeth and tongue are floating inside, I then got 3\* Bloody Mess and haven't had the problem since, for obvious reasons :D
---
Yes, you spawn a set distance from the camp unit in one direction... If you spawn to far east of your camp then move the camp unit west until you spawn at your desired location
---
Said the CM's
---
You whip it up.. 
---
Then you whip it down.. 
---
Everybody Wang Chung tonight! 
---
Said the Dev's
---
Said Todd?
---
I'd say gatling laser is best, if it didnt use fusion cores as ammo.
---
Nah you’re just a corporate shill bud, the game is trash.
---
The people that documented problems, said why it is a problem and said why and how it should be solved have had a much better success rate at getting stuff fixed in this game compared to the people that just scream.
---
yea i've been pretty lucky with not alot of issues on xbox one x but this pipboy thing annoys the piss outta me
---
With all due respect, the game was released broken - the devs said so, the last update nerfed all guns not just the rare ones. That makes it pretty unplayable. 
---
I'm in PS4. Could I please buy them?
---
I like reading them too. Especially when they go in to why, it's kind of cathartic for me lol.
---
Still defending a buggy broken mess.
---
If you accept this as 'good development' the gaming industry will quickly go back to it's grave. Maybe that's for the best.
---
Thanks for the tip, I'd wanted a decent helmet for the marine armor, hadn't thought of this, thumbs up.
---
How much?
---
He's dead Dave. They are all dead. Everyone's dead, Dave!
---
That's kinda what I was expecting. But I have no clue as to what. I didn't know if anyone else had experience anything like this. I know pre-patch people were taking multiple explosives bobbleheads and doing shit similar to this but they supposedly fixed that. I dont know what to believe anymore. 
---
I remember you from GTA online. You were being verbally supportive of everyone in the lobby and spreading positive thoughts all across the internet. You remind me of the Dalai Lama.
---
A “no-wiper”?
---
My doll house isn’t complete without a proper toilet!! 
---
What?! No plumbing?! 
---
800 for the set?
---
That wouldn't surprise me, but it's strange to only remove certain mod plans and not others. Not to mention that wouldn't explain how myself and others are getting different vendor inventories with different characters or on different days.
---
To me that implies it's either still not functioning properly or it's working as intended and they need to clarify in the patch notes. Either way, it would be really nice to get a response from a Beth rep tomorrow once they've had some coffee.
---
"I escaped death and all I got was a lousy Hunter's Pickaxe ☆"

Easy: The shop containing Atoms is the main revenue currently. You can buy the atoms with real money. That revenue will run dry if no one plays anymore.
---
I stood up on many of post to explain TSE wasn’t bad I will edit the post in later.
---
They've acknowledged this haven't they and said its been passed on to the dev's hasn't it?
---
I mean I'm not sure what that even means any more but hopefully in 5 or 6 patches they will add it in...
---
Lordy, just, look at Bethesda, stealing ideas from iD, first person shooter!? *how dare they*
---
Get an external HDD? 
---
Thanks for the input guys. I realize now my post title is completely off. The real question is, why won't they just notify us. I won't be tasked with monitoring their social media.
---
Trying to convince people you don't care by writing an thousand word essay about it.....hhmmmm
---
17% of Skyrim players never finished Helgen. 20% of Doom players never finished the first level. 15% of Nier Automata players basically never started the story mode. 
---
FO76s 12% of players not leaving the vault is totally in line with similar achievements in other games. It seems not enough players didnt earn the achievement to skew the stats in any negative way.
---
Oh come on. Do you work for them? 
---
Ah, if they have then that’s good.
---
I’m on here a lot but I hadn’t seen it mentioned yet :)
---
What like having them monies back?
---
Only issue really is if you purchased the game through PSN and i assume Xbox Live, they don't take to kindly to that charge back shit lol
---
yup and i usually remember not to open it up but sometimes it's just force of habit
---
Pretty much that on Xbox one so I hear. 
---
Down voted for sense.....fanbois hey :/
---
I've never understood why Bethesda have never hired modders 
---
I7 920 overclocked to 3.4ghz. Pretty old but beefy
---
You can fiddle with those numbers to help you reach 60fps - try looking at the texture presets in the fo76 folder to give you an idea of what values to try . I am happy between 44-59 personally. 
---
I hope it’s an improvement at least! Updated drivers?
---
I mean really, what are we? Scorch Beasts, just shitting on the ground all willy-nilly?
---
No its the modders that have generally fixed all the Bethesda fcukery
---
As far as I can see it there is a high chance that even Bethesda will realize loosing that many potential customers for the atom shop and upcoming extensions is not a great thing. Thus investing in the communitys needs before cutting the devs in half. Because if they do that, no more chance for developing extensions / more content for the game. This will happen imho if they continue like that anyway but then it will be too late.
---
Creepy O.o
---
By all means if you are happy with what Bethesda is currently doing, go on. 
---
On mobile - bear with me. Level 75, PS4. Two Sleek legs, Rank 3 Sneak, Escape Artist. Including mutations just in case - Speed Demon, Grounded, Electrically Charged, Twisted Muscles, and Scaly Skin. 
---
Been Unarmed Sneak since day 1, and now mobs see me WAY too quickly. Sometimes I skip [Caution] and go straight from [Hidden] to [Danger] with an enemy looking the complete opposite direction. Sometimes I'm permanently in [Caution]. Before Patch 5 I could chain 5 Sneak VATS attacks in a row without ever entering [Danger]. Now, I can land maybe 2 before I'm seen. 
---
yep and i just did it again :(
---
Is there any viable end game? (should be the real question.
---
If there's no end game, any build is viable. Yes its not as easy as before but they haven't removed anything.
---
Some people love glitches, exploits, etc. I personally believe some are included in some games intentionally for those kind of people to have fun. Why do some game developers/publishers have to be so totalitarian? Like games are meant to be fun. Why don't you try and let as many people have fun doing the things the want to do? Why do they always have to try and control everything everyone does?
---
no that bad. Check all threads of dissappointed players, modders, fans etc. 
---
&gt;had stopped playing FO76 a while ago
---
And yet here you still are?
---
No.. We definitely are behind schedule for content. When fallout 4 came out it was in a much more complete state. This is a shell of a game. The content here is shallow and not nearly as vast as what you'd expect from a Bethesda game. Trying to compare it FO4 a game I criticized a lot, is just shameful.. This makes that game look like a masterpiece. 
---
Bethesda is making money from science?
---
My VATS melee sneak attacks will lunge me at my target, say "Sneak attack for 2x damage." and do completely nothing.
---
Well said sir.
---
LOL at you downvotes, Reddit's so cute.
---
nice! and will be patched on next time becuase its fun....
---
No thanks.  Would be absurdly overpowered and mandatory.  
---
More like one step forward and 5 steps back. They weren't even to the starting line when the race begun, they are half way around the planet now . . .
---
About the same fans defending Bethesda are getting. Nada.
---
Exactly, there's a rectangle shape and an arm with a weapon and a vault. I was totally expecting something completely different
---
Kick for hotfix that's about right
---
Yeah the serendipity sometimes procs far too many times compared to how many times im getting hit. And its just frustrating to jump servers just to get your mutations working
---
Data mine says the only way to get that plan is cranberry bog quest reward. It may be your best hope to run the daily.
---
It gives you an extra loot now 
---
OPs 600 hours is not casual. I have over 500 myself, and if not for friends shopping on LFG, I wouldn't have a TSE. 
---
My game crashed three times from opening my pip boy nice bug updates :)
---
Open social, click leave team. Even if you are solo. 
---
The funniest part about this line is it's basically exactly what I say all the time. I work tech support for the front end of a product, and customers call all the time with feedback things they want done. I just tell them I'll pass it along to the devs, which I do. Then the devs say lolno, we're not wasting dev time on  that crap and I shrug and say I did my best. 
---
Fallout 76 has so many critical core problems, these minor bug fixes are probably not even in the top 500 priorities. Let alone people asking for new feature requests . . .
---
As they can be interacted with, i would guess its for a future dlc
---
In this case I am sorry for this comment, still I think Bethesda would do best to stop listening to people here, because most of the time it backfired at bethesda itself, they should rather take their time and do what they feel is best... Oh and so anybody feel that I try to defend bethesda, yes but also huge no, I am defending Bethesda only partially, I knew that it will come to this eventually with such game as Fallout 76 is, what I am defending is Fallout series, I am fan of this since fallout 1 and I want to see more of it in future, but if everybody get angry at it more than is necessary or show bethesda how it is not so great title anymore, they may abandon it, maybe forever.
---
Why not Vault 76?
---
Must be embarrassing being part of such a shit game
---
Mmmm pretty sure far cry could've taken its idea of revealing maps icons from assassin's Creed. And assassin's Creed could've taken its ideas of map revealing from lighthouses in Heroes of Might and Magic and they probably took liberties from somewhere else.
---
Many games have a similar structure for exploration. Watch towers make sense in Appalachia. I think you're looking into it too much.
---
I'm not defending Beth'  I've uninstalled and moved on from Failout76, but what you're complaining about is a bit absurd.
---
Yep I'm having the same issue. Stealth seems to be dead even when invisible
---
When something bypass the slap damage, they are not tse
---
Tested before, you can't bypass the damage limit even with tse dragon.
---
So either bobblehead can be stacked again or whatever new bugs introduced in last patch.
---
Stop write misleading post
---
Better yet...  Make it so event he launcher person does not know where its going to land.  
---
One thing that's been on my mind, is that I paid $80 aus for the guide book, thats going to be giving wrong info to new players since changing perks And whatnot every couple of patches
---
Here’s one post and I will add the other in a few mins.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah3c2f/bethesda_let_talk_about_bad_game_design_and_way/?st=JRLSQ5NX&amp;sh=a810a5cf
---
Lol yea and u can loot them for the helmet too
---
So you must have had no sever connection for a while, but the game did not inform you with those notifications, your client eventually crashed but progress was not updated. I'm wondering why the client was not informing you of Cannot Connect To Server and the Controls Suspended messages. 
---
Damn frustrating, think I'll implicitly close my game if I ever get a load of important junk onboard then re-start for safety.
---
I will get downvoted because people hate rules, but also hate exploitation of rules. It's a no win situation, but when you charge people cash within that framework, unless you have hard and fast rules (see code) against it, then you have no right to ban people for using your lax boundaries.
---
Bethesda is a product of, and manipulator, of the world we live in. They'll prosecute what hurts them, and celebrate what helps them. And they'll use your ignorance to benefit them.
---
So you lasted two months and gave up, yet I'm absurd?
---
Yes I agree. They shouldn’t listen to any feedback without doing tests. Understanding Meta and how things work together.
---
Lol stealth nerf
---
There were apparently already errors in it before based on bugs with underarmor and Power Armor resists.
---
This
---
Or if /u/lonevaultwanderer wants to chime in since he's on the other side of the world and it's not 3am for him.
---
I respectfully disagree, the only time positive changes have been made to the game has been as a result of fan backlash online. If you stick your head in the sand and pretend everythings just fine nothing will ever be fixed. 
---
Lmao so 76 is a prime contender to the "No Man's Sky" award. Except that Bethesda is actually trying (somewhat) to help after launch. Yet still failing? 
---
That's honestly kind of sad. I was hopefull for a fallout I could play with the bros. Oh well though. I'll look to the No Man's Sky future and hope for the best. 
---
I don’t like how colorful it is and it kinda shits on FC5’s legacy with joeseph crying and being kidnapped in the trailer. Not to mention 5’s horrible dlcs. 
---
I’ll wait till after release 
---
Your post was to long so I didn't read it but people have the right to be upset and voice their opinion. They paid their money invested their time and where let down.
---
The uptick if posts like them and these or yours are just a small indication of the state of the game considering many don't care or make the effort to post on Reddit.
---
To each their own and all that good stuff kind sir.
---
Wasn't trying write a misleading post. Just asking the community to help explain what just happened to me.
---
Stop being a dick. 
---
Thanks for the tip! I’ll check that out. 
---
Lol, there's not even a list of all mutations in it, oh well fool me once...
---
 Cliché  comment is cliché 
---
Sorry, don't want you to get flagged for duping.
---
Did you know IRL lasers (or rather, the beam they fire) are invisible and have absolutely no recoil?
---
There's a mod for that on the fallout 76 Nexus. It allows you to save up to 8 perk card loadouts.
---
Yeah until Dupers are out the way this shouldn't be in game, but it was done in World of Warcraft and worked really well. 
---
They may have to make some drops 'Binds on Pickup' though so they cannot be traded/ect, though they may already have this in place since you can't scrap legendary drops (which is annoying, I'd rather get Junk than 10Ⓒs from a Trader). 
---
The way I see it, do you want players having fun maybe breaking some rules, or do you want to punish and take away fun things and no one wants to play any more? It's very simple. But apparently people in decision making positions of power don't get it.
---
You had to buy the game to access the BETA though, that’s why I pulled the trigger on the pre-order. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't disagree with you on how the new patch nerfed weapons, or that it released in a broken state. I myself run heavy weapons and a stealth sniper build on my own characters, and I find it frustrating too. 
---
It just feels like people are intentionally attempting to cause uproar by leaving the game in such a public fashion, and the abundance of posts drowns out a lot of other content.
---
If your character is still low level you'll be fine starting now. Most of the uproar regarding the latest patch won't affect you much in the long run.
---
i was wondering too, i shot off my gun too close and expected to die,nope barely a dent.
---
Wait, youre still playing fo76 and you act surprised lmao?
---
I'm pretty sure people are actually quitting or at the very least taking very very very long breaks. I only have 1 person left on my playstation friends list who still plays this game. That's sad.
---
Yup, I generally hear bugs too
---
If I didn't play and enjoy playing FO76, the very last thing I would do is hang around this sub reading about the game I'm not playing.
---
To much free time my friend?
---
Action - reaction, Newton would have loved the Fallout series.
---
They get it. Only they are allowed to break the rules. You do as your told.
---
They never one shot people in pacifist. Prove me wrong. Most likely you had a workshop that he partly captured to make you a pvp Target. Otherwise, team mates can instigate pvp for the whole team.
---
Yawn..
---
No ones crying here. You seem to misunderstand what this is. Im complaining about the nerfs into the dirt TSE weapons got and that if bethesda had stopped players from being able to make 255 wooden boards and duping, the nerf wouldn't have been necessary. Also no where in my previous reply was a crying about not having 5k damage. Intending to have some thing is not crying about it
---
You work for Bethesda Austin?
---
Explosive Nerf, all grenades are weaker than a shorty.
---
Very agreed with this. As another oldie but goodie, I get pretty overwhelmed by the rage and the deep visceral lashing out and how ppl treat others.... Take a step back, take a break, think before you speak or type that post, consider someone else and how what you're gonna do or say would affect them, have empathy, play other games and go be with friends, take a walk, play with your pets, cook a nice meal, whatever else floats your boat. This one game has plenty of problems it is working on, but it isn't the end of the world every patch. 
---
Constructive criticism is important, also bug reporting and frustration venting here is more than understandable.... but many are really investing into this hate train so deeply and taking things to whole new levels of venom. It is at a point where it is so absolutist and polarized that you can't say you like the game and recognize the problems without ppl labeling you as shills, pr workers for bethesda, bizarre in-group vs. outsider hostile mentalities. Just in the past few days I've seen ppl replying to Ladydev in abysmal and crude ways and railing against them like they can snap their fingers and solve all problems. Don't treat ppl this way. They're human beings too. 
---
No, they are using it to create a product, then ban you from it when you use critical thinking to progress.
---
This is getting beyond a joke now. What sort of testing is being done? 
---
Any local system  buffer overflow That crashes the client is not affecting the memory state on the server itself, therefore its not a legal issue from a cyber security point of view.
---
Anyone who crafts quickly is DOSing the servers, as can be seen by the fact they slow down during that process.  This means that normal operation of the game constitutes a denial of service attack. Therefore there's no way to prove the difference between a malicious denial of service attack or the normal functionality of the game.
---
You don’t need to Pay money. Getting 800 atoms shouldnt be a Problem for somebody who plays the game ....
---
Furthermore you get one  of the costumes by playing a quest line
---
Sure, because “TSE weapons are still outrageously OP” was totally a question.
---
That's fair and a good point of view to take, and I do appreciate you taking the time to respond in a civilized manner. What's your opinion of the state of the game now?
---
I’d just be happy if the repair cost was reduced. 
---
Also, why the hell do I need springs to repair a plasma gatling?  I didn’t need any to MAKE IT!  
---
Your regular armour is unequipped when you enter PA.
---
Working as intended.
---
Edit I miss my explosive shotgun, atleat I can't kill myself with it now.
---
Your trying too hard, just move on as he has.
---
That's even moreso true with the latest patch. If that's the reason you stopped playing, you might want to wait a few more patches before jumping back in.
---
Started out on text-based &amp; MUDs too. Still pretty wild when I look back at games I started out with and see where we where we been to where we are now.
---
slapping a different title/label on cheating is still cheating.
---
Obviously their best isn't good enough as it is right now
---
This game takes patience &amp; understanding, not many people on Reddit have that.
---
But yeah, this game has nothing to be too harshly critical or whine about b/c they’re making fixes &amp; hotfixes.  This company is obviously far from perfect so don’t expect much from them.  
---
They still made a game no one else has made close to it; and just like ESO, it will eventually get better with time.  Drop it for now or drop it forever, and leave it at that by picking up a new game in the meantime.  
---
Pertaining to the guy that got banned, all you got to do is write an essay &amp; email customer support.
---
If you really did get banned &amp; still haven’t done the unbanning process, you have a class action lawsuit on your hands along w/ many others mistakenly banned. 
---
Demand a rewrite with every change. If they ban folks for following their rules, they need to compensate when they change them
---
Yeah, I know...as if...
---
This kinda just seems like a karma farm post, but I'll look past that.
---
These people you cal "tryhards" are the ones who know most about the game which undoubtably makes their opinions on certain aspects of the game a lot more relevant than the average player.
---
Also I think you misunderstand how Reddit works, it's not just the "tryhards" that are on here, I would almost go as far as to say that ~25% of daily users in this subreddit aren't that experienced at all. 
---
You say you've played video games for years, yet you think that some of the changes they've done recently (nerfing certain perks that does nothing but make the game less enjoyable for 99% of players) are fine? That's just crazy to me.
---
As you've written you are still a very low level and what I would consider a "noob", which isn't a bad thing really I mean not everyone can spend a majority of their time playing one game.
---
But this just leads me to believe that you don't really know exactly what you're talking about, and instead you're just making a long post similar to so many others which has no real use or knowledge gained whatsoever.
---
I personally don't play the game anymore, I quit a long time ago after having gotten pretty much everything I could ever want (weapons, armor, supplies etc) and I had finished all the content and reached a decently high level.
---
However I keep an eye on this subreddit just in case they might one day actually add some new content to the game, which honestly should be their number one priority in my opinion. 
---
I don't play the game anymore, but I still know what good and bad game design is, and at this point in time, the game is basically the same as it was on release except with bug fixes and minor minor additions, oh and of course unnecessary changes to perks that literally no one asked for as far as I know.
---
And sure, not releasing new content after this amount of time might be fine for any other game, but this game was released with so so little actual content (unless you count exploring and looking at stuff as content) that you can "complete" the game in hours. 
---
This is a online multiplayer rpg, this is not typically a genre of games that are meant for the casual and average players. Most online multiplayer rpgs are at least semi grindy and don't usually focus on a main story line.
---
This game is missing so much content it's unreal, at this point, it's nothing more than a heavily modded fo4 that I've put a lot of time into.
---
Also I'm not sure where you get your stats from so please do link me a source, but I seriously doubt that "less than half the players aren't halfway through the main story", and if that is the case the there really is no hope for fallout players and if those are the players that Bethesda are going to focus on, no hope for 76 either. 
---
In the end, I think your perspective is stupid and it pains me to see it get this many up votes,
---
Cheers.
---
And the end of the Violent Night event, usually 3* legendary
---
I'm a 9 to 5 worker, who plays mostly 2~3hours a day since launch, the game surely evolved, but I'm out of thing to do, and it kinda sucks that every step bethesda tries to do, they go two steps back.... sometimes I wonder if they have full control of their engine and servers.
---
Seriously, repeating the same thing everyday is like a chore (and I'm already full of that at work), its the most cliche thing a developer can come up with on a MMO to keep the playerbase going. I have to come up with several new reasons to keep playing (going for a new weapon i dont need, trying to min max everything, going platinum,etc) and thats not the customers's job, its the actually the game's job to keep me interested all the time, to glue me in.... and honestly? Theres no end game in 76, just and early and mid games, after some time, you dont feel like your effort is paying off because theres nothing to keep the game harder (sure theres the SBQ but lets face it, no real reason to kill her other than stressfull and resource burner bullet sponge).
---
My take is that Besthesda left 76 with their B (or even C) team, and moved the A team (if applied at all) to Starfield or the new Elder Scrolls 
---
Uhh
---
Thanks? 
---
Dibs on half 
---
I feel you bro everyone is just hating to hate and not even giving it a chance truly sad bro 
---
You breach the terms of service you get banned, I'm not sure what about this difficult equation you are having issues with. 
---
Aion was made by NCsoft, which had several large MMOs under their belt by that time(Lineage 1&amp;2, Guild Wars, City of Heroes, ect.) They were not a small studio by any means.
---
Slapping your consumers for playing within the game, without modding, is a cunt act. And calling folk out as cheaters for playing the game within the boundaries of the game is a cunt act. You dig?
---
The game company don't have to prove shit. 
---
Ugh, mindless carebear. Newsflash: people have every right to attack you, even if you did “nothing wrong.” Kill em back, die, leave the area, leave the server...whatever you want/are able to do.
---
Fair enough, I enjoy the game to, I do admit to spending too much time in r/fo76 can't help myself.
---
&gt; The appearance of many Plans and Recipes in Vendor inventories is **based on player level** and they will show up once the proper level has been reached.
---
As stated in the patch notes for Patch 5.
---
I made my way to Watoga at Lvl29 and did neither see plans for Combat Armor nor for any cool weapon (except the Handmade).
---
Games no fun either basically being forced to try and relvl a character so your useful agian. Sorry not gonna waste limited time getting like 20 lvls so the games somewhat fun again. Even with a tse i wasnt 1 shotting everything before so yeaaah.. 2 or 3 shots sure but i mean thats normal at a endgame situation.
---
Wouldn't it be good if the stopped patching though? The last 3 haven't been great and they were basic bug fixes, not even that many of them at that.
---
They wont talk to modders as they cant monetise that shit and imagine if the modders fixed this shit and made it epic after 3 weeks....how does that make Bethesda look? Worse than they do now that's for sure.
---
The "were new to this" shouldn't matter, if they wanted to use that BS then call it a BETA and give free access whilst they figure out how to do an online game. Not sell it full price, rinse what they can off dodgy merchandise and get that Atom store running nice and smooth whilst the rest of the code / game burns.
---
For some reason I imagine this conversation- "So you want a chargeback for the game you ordered.  But did you receive and play it?"
---
"Yes, for a few hundred hours, but the bobby pin weight kept fluctuating and they totally nerfed TSE." 
---
Request denied
---
Personally the game needs improvement in a myriad of ways and a clear direction in what Bethesda would like this game to evolve to.
---
I played over 250 hour's before I quit two months ago. It was a interesting concept and experience but definitely not what I was expecting.
---
Personally if they would have let black isle studios release their version instead of taking them to court and bankrupting them in the process. We would have seen something more complete,
---
what's your platform?
---
Of course that makes us paid shills, being paid to play Fo76 would be fun.
---
Whhhyyyy? 
---
Uninstalled, hope this sends the message fix it not scrap it. Either way I haven’t played in months bc of how boring it is. 
---
And add to that the armor piercing perks, legendary effects, and mods.  
---
As far as perks, for rifles it’s 36%, heavies 45% (only in PA), and melee 75%.  
---
BEST BOI
---
Game forums are a bubble. A few years ago now I remember a dev of one mmo I was playing saying that only about 10% of players visited the official forums. That's likely gone up now with reddit and YouTube etc. But still I'd bet the majority just see some press or a review or talk to a friend, buy a game, then like it and play it or dislike it and leave it. No fuss or fury.
---
Well shit, what happened to mine then? Bc I lost over 1000 damage per gun in the update so.....
---
Yeah I found that 1 of 2 things will happen you tried to do something before the server loaded in fully and you will see the pip boy turn on or you will just crash best way I have found is just to wait till you see all the effects go off on screen and fire a round
---
Rex was goodest boye sorry not sorry.
---
Block me too please tia...
---
It was a feature in Honest Hearts too. Don’t know if that predates it’s appearance in Far Cry though. 
---
Hello, are you willing to sell it  or trade?
---
As someone that can't play that much would you really want to have to suddenly spend 10+ lvls to get your char even back to being ok. Spend like a month of horrible horrible fucking pain lvls with shit stats. Thats what got me. I dont have the time to do this repec and streamlining. 
---
+1 to this.
---
If all you do is spew out impatient non-constructive circle-jerk criticism then stop threatening to uninstall and just do it already. 
---
Take some time off and come back later.
---
For your sake and ours.
---
Get off your fuckin high horse. Murder is murder even if there are no laws against it, of course I wouldn't kill someone even if there was no law against it. As i said, i dont play the game, and even if I did I probably wouldn't dupe because thats a hastle. But i do think is ridiculous so prevent a user from playing other games they paid for because they picked up a duplicated item, or even duplicated an item
---
If I owned a gaming company I would probably just stop making games and sell the company. And it would be because this new evolved attitude people have all of a sudden towards video games.
---
They blinded me... with science!
---
Unarmed weapons while in power armor sounds like a dream come true 
---
The other bugs you mention do not
---
The people who like base building and doing good for the community ie building pa for low lvls giving people a place to stay In nuked white springs or even just farms that people can use is what some people enjoy doing and that percentage of people is what makes the game fun since they will sometimes have open mics or have waky base builds and what not
---
Woohoo! MUDs! 48 here. Still have some of my best game experiences from muds. Tsunami wartime every 4th hour had everyones adrenaline pumping 💪
---
This was clearly a side project. I got it for the price of an Indie game so I'm happy. Just bored after 80 hours which doesn't make sense considering this is "four times larger" than Fallout 4 which I played for 200 hours. I think the limited trader caps is what keeps me from playing right now. It's too inconvenient and grindy.
---
yeah i usually try to reload a wep or open the map up first thing if i can remember
---
I have several perks with 3\* and a 1\* I use both depending how I want my load out to be, given what I'm doing in the game. At first I also thought duplicates were annoying now I use them to give a finer granularity to my current build setup.
---
It’s a fun game at first, but it’s quickly ruined by Bethesda’s incompetence. I would honestly give this game another half year to bake, then check it out. Right now Bethesda is fixing things, then rolling back patches to fix other things breaking things they just fixed again.. Players have used numerous exploits to gain items and levels, as well as tons of items that made the server unsteady..
---
Everyone here agrees the game is fun, but these developers and Bethesda themselves are honestly fumbling this so hard, and many of these issues can be fixed by modders overnight, yet Beth still can’t figure it out.
---
All of this is coming from someone who staunchly defended the game for a while, I can honestly say: just wait. I think my opinion is fairly unbiased at this point. Like others have said tho, you’ll never really know until you try it.. but do you honestly want to give your money to a company that’s being this incompetent? 
---
I found the plans in the little shack at Sunday Brothers Cabin, sitting on top of the oil drum. 
---
I have just said if it lets me move my mouse an dno spinning wheel wait a few min for him to literally turn on the pip boy to get unstuck
---
Not so.  I will buy a Fallout game if they ever return to their roots (pre Fallout 4), but I haven't played an ES game since Daggerfall.  People who like science fiction don't necessarily like fantasy games.
---
What about a coffe offered by the dude that destroy your camp, maybe u can also play Barbie while drinking it! ;) 
---
Sony doesn't really do early access, so I'm sure bgs rushed the release to deal with it and release 76 on to Sony and xb1/pc together. And ya atleast they are tryin even if its pretty shoddy. Didnt EA ditch mass effect after a few months?? I'll still play and I'm sure others will too, tbh I have a good time usually and suffer minimal bugs so I'm lucky as hell and I hope to see who ever remains in the wastes!! 
---
Agreed, well put!
---
Hold on. You can't claim both credit for "standing up" to the bullies because you did nothing wrong AND cry foul as the victim of bullying. Which is it?
---
That makes sense, although the areas referred to are called guest rooms. I would have thought they meant the hotel rooms inside the Whitesprings itself. In the management terminal, those buildings are called guest cottages if I am not mistaken. 
---
It would be exciting though if this was for future DLC, perhaps more areas of the Whitesprings being added. 
---
This isn't new 
---
That or I open a door and it pushes me back off my porch (because you know in real life we always open doors into our body forcing us backwards).
---
The game is just clunky all together. Jumping feels less smooth than playing an NES classic game.
---
 I used to be a hard core gamer, and besides work and drinking with my buddies, games were the main thing ... but once I got married things changed - now I have to optimize the game play to get as much as possible done in the shortest time, cause between work, house and family you get just a few hours to play per day in the best cases
---
Omg! And you can jump in this game just like how Mario could jump! Those thieving bastards!
---
Umm? 
---
For the same reason you ask why they ask why.
---
Considering I've never used serendipity it makes it even stranger... Every time I switched servers one mutation fixed and another broke. Unreal
---
At least with Far Cry and Assassin's Creed are under the same publisher. Unless there's a trademark on the idea, it's fair game.
---
&gt;ny way to fix this? The game crashed my pc when it went into maintenance I had to hard reboot. After that started the launcher and it's asking me to install the game, but it's already installed...
---
And if someday there is an update, how could the launcher detect it?
---
I also love the game. The developers have done a great job in many ways with it. Though now they are taking away fun things and nerfing things we have this feeling like an axe is looming over our necks. Why should we have this relationship? Where we play and wait for something else to be taken away. made more tedious or just downright destroy our character roles and abilities. Yes games are an escape from reality for a lot of people, and when the game becomes a worse reality then people are going to be pissed and quit and riot. It's just the way things are. 
---
Yes it's [only a game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A). We can lose perspective sometimes. But at the same time, they need to be flexible and listen to the people who want to play and enjoy the game, though it becomes increasingly difficult to do so when it seems like they don't listen or care.
---
I just wanted to kinda add onto this by mentioning how few ppl actually finish games at all. Some might be surprised to learn that only 10% of ppl that start a game will ever finish it. Things like valve and trophy statistics show that less than 1/3 of ppl on many popular story driven titles ever finish them.
---
When setting up your CAMP it's all about Location, Location, Location...  (grin)
---
I've had mine North-West of Fort Defiance,  for about 4 weeks now.  It's close to the traditional Nuke locations and if I head East, I just use the free travel to Vault 76 as the first hop.  The view isn't all that great, but it's very convenient and only has low level spawns nearby, mostly wolves and molerats.
---
Buy yeah, fast travel takes a lot of caps if you do it a lot without any scavenging in between.
---
I'm sure you know how vault tec experiments end....
---
Very true. The voice acting has improved vastly, but it's overshadowed by the poor gameplay design decisions. Van Buren *would* have been interesting to see, especially since I started with Fallout 3.
---
Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Beth *pay* Interplay 2 million for the Fallout rights in the end?
---
I ask why because it starts a chain of events do he constantly asking why to every response to annoy people
---
Duke Nukem had better graphics and game play though. As did Mario
---
I would betotally tempted to make a round barn using this but I could never live with it having a flat roof.
---
In that case, you could make things like walls worth less than a fusion generator.
---
Battleborn was an awesome game though
---
Except they always dip, leaving tons of bugs and broken aspects in their games, to move on to the next one. I think this game shows just why they don’t try and fix their problems.
---
I kinda like it.
---
Why is it bad to build a camp like this? Seems like this person put a lot of time to make a fortress 
---
It’s nice to know someone else feels the same way!
---
Gave up, never found a solution.
---
court ordered Fallout 76 bodyguards WHEN?
---
In Deus Ex? Crossbows and stealth usually.
---
But honestly, whenever I get the sword that kind of takes over for me.
---
Wait! Are you trying to tell me everybody’s dead?
---
So what if you're a lower level player that just happens to have your base in the blast zone? Would you be locked in your basement for the entire duration of the blast zone? Sounds like fun! 
---
Don't worry, this game is alone making all non casual players leave by it self.
---
You will be able to see that one hour after the exact time they make mods possible, about another 10 months from now on.
---
My husband and I have played the game since day of release. We have enjoyed it immensely.
---
In the beginning things were great, servers were quite stable, not much in the way of glitches/bugs/crashes effected the gameplay for us. But we've become increasingly aware of how bad it's gotten with each patch coming through. 
---
Since day 1 we've never had the opportunity or honour to have a TSE weapon of any kind. We get the usual run of the mill TS or a normal legendary with the exploding mod. We got annoyed when lower levels were sporting said weapons and were one shotting legendary enemies during events without allowing other players to even get a tap on them, we just wanted to earn it by playing the game. 
---
The servers are unstable, because of the duping issue I assume...
---
The use of bulk scrap while building or repairing is non existent and pretty much a waste of time now.
---
The "Slenderman" issue with teammates in power armour is still there, same with when they fast travel out and the frame is there where they fast travelled from as well as they disappear completely and their GT marker doesn't appear above their heads.
---
There is also a lack of content after doing missions, events, etc. It's kind of getting boring.
---
Fallout 76 has/had the potential for being an awesome game.
---
I never thought I would see the day where I'd actually become public with the issues plaguing this game that I've experienced, but the truth is, it's been really grinding my gears of late to the point where my playtime has reduced significantly.
---
The above mentioned gripes are only scratching the surface.
---
Please please please Bethesda... Get your shit together! We didn't pay $200+AUD (altogether) for a game that's becoming unplayable for us!
---
I wouldn't know because I bulk everything while repairing, crafting ammo etc. So I only ever have to swap perks once to get the most out of a crafting session.
---
My favorite quest.
---
You can't get in at the moment. I have a feeling they will be for future content.
---
On PC and the game is basically OK, barring the disconnects. 
---
These *Fallout76Custom.ini* edits made all the difference to the game for me, with only an *msi gtx750ti* the grass was a killer. Looks better with no grass in my humble opinion,can actually find the golf balls. Whitespring was impossible before removing the grass.
---
`[Grass]`
---
`fGrassStartFadeDistance=1000.0000`
---
`fGrassMaxStartFadeDistance=3500.0000`
---
`fGrassMinStartFadeDistance=1000.0000`
---
`bAllowCreateGrass = 0`
---
`[Archive]`
---
`bInvalidateOlderFiles = 1`
---
`sResourceArchive2List = GammaBeastProjectile.ba2`
---
GammaBeastProjectile.ba2 is from the Nexus mod:
---
[Reasonable ScorchBeast Scream](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/176)
---
Make it so I can actually see ScorchBeasts while I fight them.
---
I did not know about this! (not being an american, among other things) Thanks for sharing! 
---
When I saw the red stars on houses in FO76, I just thought it had something to do with union membership or stuff like that - not even in the world of Fallout people would be dumb enough to publicly advertise socialist sympathies in the pre-war political climate &gt;\_&gt; 
---
Speaking of critical thinking (or at least things that support it), evidence of bans please?
---
[PS4]
---
I accept donations from anyone who's done with the game - caps, plans and all the other good shit! :)
---
i was tought to stand by my principles and not back down. they cheated people,lied,and even broke laws. yes it is a game. but in the end it's not about the game. 
---
This is the kind of opinion that needs to be showcased, not the,"This game is trash don't waste your time on it." or the, "Don't listen to the haters, it's actually really good." 
---
&gt; This is not something that happens with any other game I play.  
---
Yes it does. That's how PS4 handles updates. It makes a copy of the complete game file during updates. This post is a daily occurrence over at r/PS4
---
Some random kind person on Xbox gave me those plans and I have been forever grateful waiting until I reach a higher level to give back 
---
Dude obviously they didn't want you there. You chose to let them beat on you so you could cry about it. Just freaking log out and log back in or block them, boom problem solved. But instead you wanted to annoy them by being in the way, tagging their mobs, running around like a defenseless chicken while looting, and possibly in the way of mob trains. If your not strong enough to solo white springs then get out or bring a higher level buddy and pray someone tags  you.
---
&gt;I have preordered every Bethesda game since I first fell in love with Oblivion and still put it in my top ten games. I have put nearly 500 hours into fallout 76 and if you combine my time from 3, New Vegas, and 4 with that; we are easily over 3000 hours played. 
---
Nobody gives a shit, just get to the point.
---
I thought it felt a little faster tonight with the amount of times I was getting the thirsty message. Some ppl are saying the same with fusion cores and stuff. Maybe there was an error in increasing the tic speed? 
---
Although I agree with you on the non-representativeness of the people of this subreddit, I must say that they are the one making the feedbacks about gameplay balance, bugs, etc. The vast majority of players do not know how to make feedbacks to Bethesda nor the existence of this subreddit. 
---
There are a lot of drama-queens and irrational demands here, but they exist only to compensate (and no one can argue with this) for the lack of standards in this game. 
---
Yea same I managed to get a TSE hunting rifle the other days of a standards molerat!
---
I'd been logging in for the Camden daily.. So about 30 minutes each time, I think? A few weeks ago there was always at least ten friends online, but even that dwindled to nobody online. I've stopped logging in as well. I was waiting for the patch to, hopefully, fix some of the bugs. But things are worse now with the nerfs. So, I'll just keep waiting until they're sorted. 
---
Bethesda: wait theres a crouch button??
---
Maybe Bethesda (BGS) as a game design company want a common standard instead of wasting time writing and maintaining "one time / throw away code" and all that involves every nth year.
---
Harper's ferry is perfect for that. Even better, if there are ghouls. Just hop onto the balcony and watch them with satisfaction.
---
^And ^yes, ^I ^wear ^a ^harness ^with ^raider, ^trapper ^and ^leather ^armour.
---
How old is your ps4 OP? 
---
I’ve had mine since they launached. Most folks I assume have a pro and am afraid if I buy this game I’ll have a shit time. This is a rare thread in which ps4 players are reporting a positive experience, it gives me hope. 
---
He promotes RMT obviously has no brain
---
Actually, you could just take over the workshop and build a fusion generator or a bunch of large generators (if you have the plans).  The core generator needs 100 power to run.  But if you don't have generator plans, then yeah, you need to repair Poseidon to provide the necessary power.
---
*Eve Online* was released in North America and Europe in May 2003
---
Daily downtime for maintenance. Still going *reasonably* strong.
---
I don't get why everyone in this post gets downvoted...
---
I personally can't remember anymore I was keeping up to date with the litigation  way back in the day but they kept it pretty quiet and the information seems hard to find now. 
---
It would have definitely been cool to see them create van Buren. Since Bethesda I feel haven't been able to really capture the techno conspiracy end of the world satire humor bordering on Truth mixed in with the good old table top feel come to life that I appreciated.
---
Which now leaves me to wonder how much of the new player base has ever played a table top game or card game.
---
Don't forget Mr. Pebbles's house.
---
Let's not pretend hacking and exploiting a game for self gain is anything to be lauded. 
---
If this all had happened in an offline single player game, sure, whatever. This is an online multiplayer game. These "critical thinkers" (LOL!) didn't just help themselves but helped to ruin the experience for others.
---
This is nothing more than hollow propaganda.
---
&gt; Now, due to their own ineptitude, it gets you banned. 
---
This is like the thief blaming the victim of not having strong enough locks.
---
Your perspective is ludicrous on the face of it.
---
Sixteen times the detail
---
As I don't believe you saying if the game isn't tailored to the 1% it is t going to succeed take destiny 2 for example they catered to casual fan base and look what happened it was absolute trash, fast forward a year and they are leaning towards the 1% and now it's a 10x better this game HAS potential but it can't keep HAVING potential, it needs to start finding its identity soon bc even for a casual player this game is lackluster at best 
---
I shoulda bought a bong :(
---
Ah, the good old Andromeda sink or swim
---
What is this rant about! I’ve tried reading it three times and I still don’t understand.
---
The other subs have their own identical idiocy. The trolls in /fallout act like 76 killed their parents and should be shut down. They literally posted a longwinded bitchfest about why everyone else is wrong.
---
Do you repeat this spam on the other subs?
---
Nice! I like how I can't tell where some things there were already in the game or it's from your camp. It's like it blends in mostly seamlessly :)
---
Well thats strange for it to proc if you dont even have it equipped but if it works then thats not a bad bug although wouldnt consider any bug good but atleast it doesnt have anything negative
---
They patched explosive guns they noe do 25% damage instead of 100
---
If DETECTED is white then you are being detected by a friendly.  They seem to be able to detect you from long distances (i.e. any of the flying bots, robots, etc.).  Only enemies, red DETECTED, seem to be affected by stealth.  At least that's been my experience on the PS4.
---
When you say:
---
"unbelievably decisive discourse"
---
I think you really meant to say:
---
"unbelievably derisive discourse"
---
awesome..overencumbered?  just take in some rads  :)
---
You can run multiple instances of the game / multiple accounts, by opening the application a second time where you've installed the game. "\\Bethesda\\Games\\Fallout76\\fallout76.exe"
---
From there just login with your other account and off you go. No need for a VPN or virtual machine etc.
---
Dont jinx it..
---
You can't really impose your definition of a word onto the  way somebody else uses it. This is especially true when there are known to be many different definitions used by different crowds of people, depending on context. You can assume to know the intentions of others, but that's not always ideal.
---
All of it usually followed up by a community manager  "WOW thanks for that awesome post for how to craft ammo! We need more good things and less bad =)"- Bethesda Community manager 
---
I honestly liked playing the game. (Not loved, but liked.) The part that killed me on it was the fact that the stash was broken. (Considering the number of issues with the stash, I shall elaborate.) Not only did the limit seem stupid, but it didn't't help that the already small limit was dropped even further by the fact that the weight of items would double or triple when placed in the stash. As in, I would have an empty stash, I would place something weighing .5 in it, and it would register as 1. Then I would place another of that same item and it would go up to 2. It's honestly disappointing that I can have a higher weight capacity than my stash even without excavator.
---
Totally with you. YouTube is just full of bullshit rage about the game now. Oh no! They balanced a massively overpowered item! How terrible!
---
You've gotta remember this is reddit. If you show support for an idea you have to suport it's consequences.... Even when those consequences are taken to redculouls extremes
---
I'm getting constantly disconnected on PS4 and SBQ fights are laggy AF and unbeatable. No clue what special version you are playing right now that's stable.   Case in point I'm basically stuck at Welch station because I keep logging In and being kicked for the past 40 mins
---
Coming from a programmer, that sounds fairly accurate.
---
I honestly just come to this sub because i like watching all the self important idiots freak out. There's much better communities for fans than here or r/fallout
---
Hey you have the first decent argument against. Idk.  But you have a very good point.
---
I only know how it used to be but I'll try from my limited info now 
---
Watago vendor *train station has random base plans and some other cool things 
---
BOS vendor in watago has all PA mod plans and some PA mods
---
Camden park vendor has all excovator PA mod plans this is all I know ATM i haven't checked happeries ferry or Grafton since the (known) plans change
---
Be cool if it was instanced player housing. Limited space, no farming, but it's completely safe. Larger spaces would cost more caps. 
---
Essentially what you're saying is doubling the rate of fire. That might be ok for your standard semi-auto but that'd be OP af with automatic weapons.
---
Could you imagine how devastating a legendary minigun with this effect plus some other damage dealing effect would have? We'd move from an explosives meta to an auto one.
---
Offer a counter-perspectice then, raher than an Unhelpful "you suck"? 
---
Is your period key broken
---
&gt;I enjoy seeing how assholes think.
---
With a username and attitude like yours i think you already know
---
I just want to tell the doggo in the mire that he's a good boi and give him treats :-(
---
Wow, cool! Today I learnt. Actually I was really confused why the stars were there.
---
Thanks! I hope, we gona get more stuff for the camp, so I can make it better. And a bit bigger budget ofc :D.
---
I wonder whatever happened to responsibility. at one point, heads would be rolling for such a massive mess up.
---
in the entertainment industry as well. movies get infinitely more flack. but no, god forbid the multimillion dollar company gets held accountable.
---
On PC. That's about it.
---
So is it worse for you? The same?
---
Here are some at Whitespring. But some of them got removed. The 2 in the vendor place behind the counters. 13 and 14 on the list. I didn't see them for a long time. 
---
[https://gearnuke.com/fallout-76-ultimate-bottle-cap-stash-location-whitespring-resort/](https://gearnuke.com/fallout-76-ultimate-bottle-cap-stash-location-whitespring-resort/)
---
I was just hoping for a comprehensive list on google forms or something where people could go to and look for said plan and know which vendor to find it at now that they aren't randomized.
---
No as far back as there have been online games there have been ban's for people who do shitty things to get an advantage above other players by using glitches in the game. 
---
Those numbers do look pretty terrible o.o
---
That would take effort on Bethesda's end. Don't expect it
---
Wait...   The last plumber that I talked to from "Plumbers R' Us" wanted a TSE shotgun for payment.  I guess the TSE market crash has affected you guys as well.... (grin)

Give it enough time and I'm sure that someone will do it. It's already happened with weapon and armour mods and the like.
---
First 100 hours we a blast for me too. I had an amazing time beating the main story and alot of side missions. But like I said I've had enough of this bullshit. Metro Exodus awaits. 
---
They still have some randomisation but not as much 
---
Those I posted up above are for sure vendor selling spawns 
---
Also the enclave science wing sells serum plans now
---
That would require people in here to A) not be so arrogant/full of themselves. 
---
And B) not be such karma whores that they have to post a "reee im leaving" tantrum thread every time the devs change something
---
Most of them carry on playing regardless. They just need attention
---
The bestest boy. That's the only add-on I'll ever need. 
---
Okay I get the fortress, but does it really need the 50 baseball statues and hundreds of plants?
---
This is the dumbest thing that they allow CAMP placement there. Also kills the framrate completly on Ps4
---
Was saying I think that is some what accurate account of what’s happening.
---
Is trading a glitch?
---
I agree, however in the original state you could have one that did double damage... basically the same as doubling the rof without the drawback of spending more ammo.  I  just don't like that they essentially neutered what was the best perk in the game (albeit WAY too overpowered to begin with)  Also with something a bit simpler like an auto combat rifle or something similar it would force more reloads and take the same ammo as just holding the trigger an extra two seconds.  
---
What about blueprints?
---
Well done, sir.
---
This. Most people i know (myself included) got it in the black friday sale
---
Did you seriously just use fallout as an excuse to advertise your building in fortnite? oh man... 
---
This Is a really stupid discussion 😒
---
I cant believe this one game divided a community so much 
---
Just did that 2 days ago. I will check the state of the game in 1 year from now. I am being optimistic.
---
What level are you ? Cause if you are under 30 that is becoming the norm. 
---
I'm playing exclusively with permadeath rules, as I'm doing this with every game for the last 10 years. For me it's actually the ONLY way I can enjoy games.
---
Yes, Fallout 76 is very playable this way, despite all the problems the game still has.  
---
1.) If a disconnect or CTD happens it seems that your character is immediately, or at least pretty quickly removed from the world so you don't have a risk being artificially killed (without the ability to defend or heal). The game is still riddled with bugs but I have yet to encounter one which threatened me with death.
---
2.) The difficulty of PVE in Fallout 76 is a joke, truly.
---
I'm playing games since mid 80s and this is the easiest game I played, by far, ever.  People like to mention scorched beasts but I killed one at level 26 (and that as a melee character) and only thing that cost me was a couple of stimpaks and a few chems like fury and pychotats/bufftats. I'm level 30 now, didn't have to restart even once, and the the lack of challenge is so obvious that I'm actually thinking to quit the game altogether, or just maybe restart without ever touching a power armor. I play solo only and don't see a reason to team up and to have even easier time.  
---
IMO this is the BIGGEST flaw of Fallout 76 - it has "CASUAL" written all over it. Goes hand in hand with Bethesda's ultimate goal to make as much money as possible and therefore try to appeal to a wide, casual audience.
---
3.) PVP on the other hand is a completely different thing. I've seen footage of players getting one-shotted, but the community is suprisingly non-hostile. I suppose it's because there is absolutely nothing to be gained by killing others, just as it's nothing to be lost by dying. So far I was never attacked or threatened by other players. I'm not sure if I should like this.  
---
It would be great if Bethesda would implement permadeath-only servers but honestly, I don't really care if everybody or nobody except me plays the game this way.  Just like in single player - Permadeath gaming is an attitude. If I can't lose in the game, I can't win either. How people can still enjoy Fallout 76 without ANY risk whatsoever is beyond me, but to each their own.
---
Ehh you can't just make up survey results and call them truth. I say TSE is at 95% and other at 5%, simply because TSE was the only thing negatively affecting me (or affecting me at all). Not that it matters, we don't have a survey. But I'd reckon it's closer to the truth than your estimate.
---
Someone who knows what they are talking about. You provide a very good response and very valid points. You are are correct. My point was not to the exact functionality of what they are doing but if charged with a cyber crime, how the attacks would be categorized as. Lawyers have to define the exact charges and usually pick the closest definition that fits. It is honestly hard to know for sure, unless I know what the server and OS that Bethesda is using. If I was looking into it, I would go into the server event logs and user accounts. I have very little knowledge on how game servers work. I can only base what I am saying off servers I have worked with. I have built servers but I am not a server ADMIN. Cyber security requires you to know a little of everything. I could only prove this if I had access to Bethesda servers. 
---
Know on the other hand, the you tube videos provide pretty much all they need. The Ebay accounts, and the like, are just as bad. These things are more damaging to individuals then any proof of what happened on the server. It is like recording yourself stealing a car, then trying to sell it on Ebay. What other proof do they need.
---
Yes, yes they did. 
---
Nothing wrong with that. 
---
People back in Austen’s day used to treat novel readers the same way they now treat gamers.
---
“OMG you’re reading a NOVEL? Ladies are so stupid. Get a life lol.”
---
Now it’s “OMG you’re playing a GAME? Boys are so stupid. Get a life lol.”
---
Humans need to get off other human’s backs with regard to how they use their leisure time.
---
If you told someone nowadays that you were using your time off work to really catch up on your reading, they’d praise you.
---
Games are an art form, playing them is a) enjoyable and b) has cognitive benefits. Different ones to reading but no less valuable.
---
Don’t let anyone game shame you, my man.
---
Just stop already.. Seriously you're regurgitating shit spewed by shit youtubers who didn't play the game which completely puts some of your good points out of the equation. You don't need to dodge the sb attacks because once you're level 40+ you can easily tank it without any perks, hell I tanked it in lvl 25 excavator.
---
You bought into the hype? What hype considering most of the reviews were negative beyong belief. 
---
Who got banned for trading? You are really reaching for something.
---
Oh shit, does it come off like that?? Not trying. I should delete this then, huh?
---
Also it was nerfed to 25% not 20%
---
I am Fallout and Bethesda fan, and enjoyed playing 76. But to be honest, it has serious issues what comes to design, economy, performance and so one. Still I have good time.
---
But those problems. For example, I finally fought my way to nuclear silo (solo, of course, this is what Bethesda games are) and launched nuke. It was long way there, grinding xp, gathering gear and other preparations. When I emerged silo and was ready to head blast zone go enjoy effects of my path, worst happened:
---
*Disconnected from server.*
---
I have not touched game since.
---
I don't agree with the cap suggestion.
---
Before the patch it could take anything from months to never to get some of those plans.
---
They have already trivialized it enough by suddenly making them available at vendors, no need for further trivialization at this point.
---
Moreover the more caps you dump into the economy the further you devalue the 'cap'.
---
RTV this map sucks 
---
The problem aint about the bugs man, i also enjoyed the first 60 hours of gameplay like a little child but when it comes to the late game after you finish the main quest line the lack of content is soooo huge that u end up getting bored
---
It felt more stable before the last patch nukes freezes my character when I step in the area. SBQ  health bar freezes in the middle of the fight. Your health bar does the same then you see it drop in seconds. I open my inventory? Disconnection. Even in areas where I am alone. 
---
That's because the definition has changed over time.  Hotfix originally meant exactly what OP said, and some older IT types like myself still think it means that exclusively.
---
But it changed over time, just like 'alpha test' used to mean "internal testing stage, for paid QA professionals" but now means "just fucking release any old shit, get users to pay US for it lol".
---
This is very useful information, and I will make sure to read the linked texts properly when I have time. 
---
One point, however: metadata on what players *do* in the game does not necessarily correlate perfectly with what the players *like* to do. E.g. I'm using a two-handed melee weapon in FO76 because I have found it to be effective, but for various reasons I would prefer if my one-handed melee weapons performed better instead. 
---
This does not contradict any of what you shared here, just a reminder that even if you have large amounts of metadata, it can be useful to take player opinions into account as well. How to gather that information effectively, however, is... not easy. 
---
There are two at wes tek. Theres also one, on the roof of nukacola plant.
---
Lol. This comment is on the level of "All Muslims are terrorists" in it's stupidity. 
---
there's one that spawns around the mound where the deathclaw spawns on Deathclaw Island that always has 100 for me before using the search function 
---
The first game to feature shooting a gun or movement better get their lawyers in gear lol. What a shit thread.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't major issue is causing more grind, less weapon build varieties, larger gap between casual and pro, old bugs,  and unusable weapons?
---
Also can't compare single player content vs online content. 
---
Can confirm this has never happened to me.
---
There has been unequivocal proof that the old duping method has been brought back, bobby pin weight has been *increased* post-patch, and a lot of the Perk Cards have been nerfed. That's not "untruthful", that's simple facts.
---
They could make the names client side. I am not sure if the engine allows it but i think that would be the solution. I am pretty sure the reason why they dont allow people to name things is so we dont have 200 shotguns called "Curt Kobains Breakfest"
---
I play the game, too. You realize that you can also BUY scrapped items, right? What are you bulking with your own plastic that you want to scrap later besides maybe aluminum to save stash weight? Totally makes sense they would expect you to consume a resource to do that. That's how these things work. If you are having a tough time getting plastic, I can't help you. That shit is everwhere.
---
Also, you forgot to add "mic drop" to the end of your post.
---
Yes Dave, they are all dead.
---
Even Chen.
---
Can Confirm #2 and #17. Will try other ones after i get home from work.
---
wardaki got married first he was desperately trying to do his wife but couldn't so he gave up and left from banging the door and said, your virginity (hymen) is like a rug, his responses, you nasty PS of shit didnt even let me to take off my nikar
---
Never did the Lighthouse event cuz got there in 5 minutes left at best. Not to mention there's too few monsters to finish it in 5 mins.
---
Both Bit Coin and Tulips have innate value, it’s just a lot less than people think it is. 
---
Lol at TSE weapons being the build for casuals.
---
What a ridiculous post
---
Yup, I’ve tried this event twice now. Once on my own, and once with someone else. They either need to up the spawn rate or the loot rate in my opinion.
---
I wish that when one of the maid bots sees this they pick up the items and add them back to your inventory with a quip about you losing something and them graciously returning it. 
---
Dropping weapons in front of the security bots could get a warning about leaving dangerous items laying about. 
---
&gt;this is brand new ground for Bethesda
---
So shouldn't they have turned to maybe....Zenimax Online since they made ESO and it was a good game and considered new ground for Zenimax? I mean, at least ESO didn't have a new controversy every week. On top of that, BGS shouldn't have re-introduced old bugs and used an older build for their latest "patch".
---
I would imagine that's the point of this camp.  Make a tempting target so they can farm caps off players.
---
no i won`t :)
---
SNAFU on PC
---
this
---
I keep doing the same expecting some kind of huge changes. I am always disappointed after playing for like ten minutes and thinking, what was I expecting? There is nothing new for me to do here.  
---
i only play with ranged weapons wtf are u talking about?
---
To be fair, if Bethesda is tracking uninstalls, is to help estimate how many customers they will have in their atomic shop. Once that gets too low they might just give up and finally let modders fix their game like how it's been since FO3. 
---
Eh I just leave games installed unless I need the space. More of a pain to have to reinstall if you ever want to randomly play for a little. 
---
Good lookin out
---
sorry you forgot to put /s at the end of your comment
---
It's not bypassing an in-game limit at all.  It's using in game mechanics to bypass a per-character limit.  Now the devs could turn around and say, "yeah, the game mechanics allow that, but we still consider it an exploit".  But they haven't, and until they do, your opinion means squat I'm afraid.
---
Critical thinking: Muslims.
---
You fucking idiot.
---
Multiboxing is perfectly permissible. No need to muck about with a vpn.
---
The Red Rocket sign was 5% of my Camps budget.
---
Dogmeat dying to a forcefield in Fallout 1 is canon. :(
---
they all quit playing the game, sorry
---
I was having a problem earlier where legendaries weren't showing up for quite a while after I had killed the enemy (enough time it had turned into a meat pile)
---
Here it is..... Dumbest thing I have read all day.
---
I can agree with you. You sound reasonable. 
---
The fact is i am 44 years old, i have a full time job in italy, i played fo76 in my spare time, i am kinda casual, i was starting to feel confortable with my gears and weapons (but not overpowered at all), i was struggling to keep playing and my explosive build and wepons (no TSE) where one of the things that help me going on. 
---
I'm not interested in general speeches, this is about me only, but this last patch, and all that came together (the re-production of old bugs, and the apparent ineptitude of bethesda) just made me lose hope.
---
I did uninstalled the game 2 days ago, and the Bethesda launcher too.
---
I plan to check the status of the game in 1 year from now. I am being opritmistic.
---
Still patiently waiting for the day we can have doggos in 76; if it ever comes.
---
I went back and saw what you have posted. Your knowledge is way above mine. To give you an idea of my level of knowledge, I took the OSCP and did NOT pass. It is a difficult exam. I do continue to practice and plan to go back and take it again. I have worked with lawyers a few times, helping them with technical knowledge. Very few lawyers know much about the world of IT.
---
Hey, sometimes the "poop" bags have hidden treasures. Lol
---
I just tank the hits myself, they are all just energy hits anyway, so grounded effectively neutralises them as does the default leather armour.  
---
Large chunks of the fanbases of Star Wars, Star Trek and The Simpsons have spent the past couple decades complaining about their respective franchises.
---
He had them in storage after using the glitch anyway, might as well use them I guess.
---
Yeah how about no lol? You really don't understand how the internet works oh well 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yeah, they clearly knew about that sub, since their joke is about it being done by a single word instead of word**s**
---
Have you or anyone of your friends played any game developed by Bethesda? If you had then you would've known that modders are the people that fixed their games. A game with an economy can't play well with modders because you don't want people getting free cosmetics that they could be paying $10 or more dollars for. Meaning FO76 was rigged from the start. 
---
Lost almost 100 plastic tonight because of this.
---
Are you sick at the time?
---
West Tek is great. Just did a round with 4 legendaries inside.
---
Yeah. Either I’ve been extremely lucky (I’m on PS4, for what that’s worth), or I just don’t derive the same pleasure from being overcome with rage as others do. 
---
Oh I'm definitely not saying it covers all the discrepancy, just that there are bound to be some Beta players who haven't bothered to make a new character yet to get the achievements.
---
Add the ideas of only sirens sounding the nuke dropping in the zone and then having the creatures in the nuked zone turning into nuke only variants so their loot tables remain different and you got yourself a winner! Definitely need a way for the creatures to change past just casual glowing; a whole new tier of danger with new bosses or multiple new bosses that can show up unique to each region.
---
I’ve had a problem with not receiving the sneak multiplier when sneaking and team members with you and some times when I’m in caution status it’s not hitting. 
---
where is that disease curing fountain, btw?
---
I have no idea how old you are but as far back as I remember people who cheat in MMO’s get banned. This going back 2 decades to Everquest. I remember on the Nameless Server a guy who figured out he could kill a raid mob single handedly when raid groups of 60+ would die to it constantly. He sold the drops to people for real cash and guess what he got banned. 
---
Yes. How dare we expect an online game not to have a problem every single week or every single patch? We're completely out of line asking for a game to work and not be bugged to hell 2 months after release and for old bugs not to be reintroduced.
---
In case you couldn't tell, there was sarcasm in every single line above this one.
---
Yeah for now but we can hope in the future they get their acts together and fix them all together so crazy things like this can become a possible reality.
---
Likewise. I’m going to go from stealth sniper to stealth stabber, see how that goes. 
---
&gt; There is no such thing as a universal industry standard for software development
---
Indeed.  But "using version control properly" is pretty much a general standard used by any competent development house.
---
Weeks. Literally, weeks. 
---
I’ve been playing this game on an Xbox One X since 30/12. Before that, it was an original XBOne. All since launch on 24/11. (In Australia, in case you’re wondering about the date format)
---
I can count the number of “crash to desktop”  that I’ve experienced on one hand, DCs from server: not that many more, tbh.
---
I’m always amazed at the number of “this patch has made the stability worse” posts that appear after each patch, but I wonder if these are either just an unlucky minority (and platform dependant) or if there are a few too many fibbers.
---
Well it just how most people don’t like Dark Souls 2 because it doesn’t pit you against a boss almost immediately before starting the game. 
---
in the gazebo 
---
I just thought it was me, but I'm using twice as much food and water than I used to, haven't noticed it with the fusion cores though. Maybe they've accidentally changed the consumption rate?
---
Yes it's a game but if you order something from a restuarant and they didn't give what they advertised(or even your exact your order). Would you just eat it or ask them to fix it? Most should ask for a fix for it and just have the order come back wrong again. 
---
You buy a product,  it is only fair you get what was given / shown. 
---
Yep perma danger is real, I encountered it multiple times today... 
---
I’m soo happy that I didn’t bought this game. Phew! 
---
I engaged in pvp last night with a level 92. I am level 167 now, with a decent build and weapons. He took next to no damage. His health was barely being affected by my 382 damage shotgun. Also... he then 1 shotted me. He then destroyed my camp, getting a 200 cap bounty. No point in trying to get the bounty. I thought this shit was meant to be fixed?? They have nerfed the only means of defence against these pricks. 
---
Got proof? Not hard to hit the "share" button on ps4 and snapshot the last 15 mins of gameplay
---
Aim for a two shot cryo. And yeah I thought you were taking all of them at once 😂 I was going Uhhh over dose much!
---
Sorry but no, the game sold terribly so it's worthless. 
---
Well, since tuesday's update I have twice failed to take public workshops because of enemies spawning underground, which is something they fixed in patch 4. It also seems like my character forgets which weapons he had equipped between logins, which also got fixed in patch 4. I haven't seen anything about those issues being fixed *again* in yesterday's maintenance. Granted, I haven't actually had time to play since the hotfix, so these things may have been dealt with without being mentioned specifically, but those are examples of fixes that were reverted in patch 5. 
---
The shitpost to rule all shitposts...ladies and gentlemen, you have your champion!
---
Why even give a shit? 
---
The last game I bought from Bethesda was Fallout 4. Will they ban my Bathesda account for using any mods ?
---
Even if Bethesda doesn't fix everything perfectly to what everyone wants we all know that as long as they release the ability for modding and private servers that the possibilities for this title will be endless. 
---
😂
---
*Rollout 76 More Patches
---
It's still double damage, and since ammo is not an issue when you oneshot everything it's just a damage boost. 
---
On pc after patch i dced once, but that was on me. Very stable currently. 
---
Couldn't find fallout 76 in my local shop.... Must be coz it's sold out still eh lol?! You're talking shit and attempting to change mass opinion but it won't work. Boys are boys. Girls are girls. A turd is a turd. 
---
You're not alone! In the software projects I've worked-on, hotfixes were always applied while the servers were live - always. 
---
How much costs the long coat?
---
Watoga shopping plaza for Power Armor mods T45, T50, T60
---
Personally I think this game would be perfect if it was just co op, bit like Ghost Recon Wildlands is. That way people can do what they want without affecting others with trolling or camp placements. 
---
Your point of view is completely wrong. Imagine paying 60 bucks for your food you saw in menu and they put shit in your plate. Or buying a bong that broke. You can enjoy but you payed for 60 bucks bong not broken ass one. 
---
Just because “it is only a game” doesn’t mean they can sell you a shitty product. 
---
That’s basically an NPC comment at this point.
---
Except for disconnect on login (caused by me failing to run the launcher to update since patch, lol, I don’t run from launcher) it’s much more stable for me.  No disconnects or lag.  I don’t do nuke zones (yet).  
---
Starting with a comment highlighting your lack of understanding and knowledge on a subject, then proceeding to give your self stated uninformed opinion regardless, shows a truly staggering lack of self awareness. It's the ramblings of a drunkard, one that is wasted on nuka cola rum (there's a hidden meaning there). YOU are embarrassing. Unless you know anything about a subject, best not spout off gash opinions.
---
Well I saw all the other loot like scorchbeast bones, hide, meat, organs, and ultracite power armor mod, torso, and prime plan but no legendary.
---
Can you be more precise, please? There are a lot of gazebos at Whitespring.
---
Yeah for real, I mean wheres the Schorchbeast KING huh Bethesda!? And is it just a coincidence that the Mirelurk Queen is ten times the size of the King? I think not! This blatant misandry needs to stop!
---
Im trying to get a Picture currently getting attacke by a scorchbeast
---
Except they did give you exactly what they advertised. A multiplayer fallout spinoff
---
The community's solely at fault for expecting new vegas 2
---
Don’t cry, they’re all fine.
---
3 months ago and there are STILL game breaking bugs in the game, not to mention that they are introducing new ones, re-introducing old ones with each patch. That is the main the problem. The direction Bethesda is heading, not that they haven't released new content. The content that is in the game is lacking for sure but it would be tolerable if you didn't disconnect every day, losing progress and if you didn't encounter all the other bugs plaguing this game. Fo 76 needed at least 6 more months of BETA testing and development before release. That is the main problem, that we got a game in ALPHA for 60-80 dollars. Not to mention that the price dropped to half of that within 2 fucking weeks. 
---
Do you seriously not see the problem with that?
---
They’re fine with the war, just don’t mention anything about the Nazi, especially any sort of collusion or compilation between the Nazis and German people. 
---
Pretty much, I'm just wondering what they are using, it has to be max 90% in their specific weapon like single shot or auto rifles, bloody mess, adrenaline, tenderizer, explosive demolitions, and since they are in a squad they could use revenant, bobbleheads, and drugs. But, still the damage they were doing it has to be over the thousands to melt her that fast. Like before the nerf I could maybe do almost 500 damage,
---
That's different. The video card manufacturer and the game publisher made a deal, that the game is to be bundled for a marketing purpose. The video card company didn't pay (or very littel) for each copy of the game.
---
In this case here the retailer had to much copies of a product he already paid for his full pirce in the distribution^1. Now he's decided to swalow the loss of sitting on the merchandise and giving it away to get the shelf space back.
---
So here Gamestop just wrote off a huge amount of money as loss.
---
^1 Either that or Gamestop wanted to return unsold product. Usually big chains have some sort of agreement with distributors that a certain percent of the product if unsold can be returned within a certain amount of time. Bethesda said keep it with a credit note for the price as they didn't want it back either. 
---
it just works
---
....They made a multiplayer mod for Skyrim...
---
Now they just need to get it over to FO4 so Bethesda can see what they needed to do 
---
Yeah I need the hard drive space as well.  The Division 2 is on the cusp of launching, I'm going to go take care of my co-op shooter itch there instead.  I'd have loved to have stayed with this game, but enough is enough.  I'm both bored having gone through all the content in a very short time, they can't do anything but go back and forth trying and failing to fix bugs that have existed since the beta tests, we get no new content other than lots of new visuals to spend real money on, I'm done giving them chances to get good.
---
I've seen a lot of game bungles but this has been one of the worst.  I don't get why they don't take the advice to take the game down and do a re-do like FFXIV did.
---
If they ever fix the game up enough, I may return one day, but I am uninstalling right now.
---
This point has been made time and time again that hardcore gamers aren’t the majority, that’s an obvious statement. What isn’t obvious to you casuals is that you make a boring game.
---
You make a game that gets stale within a few weeks to a month because of the way *you* play. Calling for changes and “fixes” that are detrimental to someone who puts time into the game.
---
If you don’t want to play the game that much or you can’t that’s fine you just won’t get everything the other people who do dedicate time to it for, and if you think “there’s better things to spend Time on”, then you shouldn’t be dictating how games are made and played.
---
It’s like if you played a sport really well due to you understanding the rules of the game and performed well within those rules, then some little leaguer comes in and starts complaining for rules to get changed because it doesn’t fit his schedule or his needs.
---
If you called for changes that dumb down a game that’s already barren of longevity you need to reconsider why you’re playing video games at all. Might as well just watch TV if you want to be brain dead 
---
It's one of those good old Bethesda secrets. Having to adapt to a game because they're too lazy to fix it.
---
Aaargh! so frustrating! for the second time weapons are disappearing from my inventory when repairing it. I had a 3 start legendary Death tambo which disappeared a few weeks ago after repairing. Today I repaired my All Rise(pretty crucial item when you are a melee player) and it just disappeared. Maybe it's related to the weapon artisan perk that I have equipped.
---
I've only been able to use them coming down from an upper-floor piece. You can use them to give the illusion of support to overhangs... But only sometimes, they are finicky.
---
Up until you posted this I hadn't even noticed so it doesn't matter and no one seems to be bothered by it or care
---
It never was.
---
You engaged pvp? If he had simply 382 armor resist your damage would be halved. So 191. Then I assume you have explosive? Dense chest and Fireproof. Assassin armor reduces pvp damage by 8% x5 so 40%. Etc. How is he a prick if you engaged?
---
Wow...
---
Let's go WAY out of our way to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you're right, is it really that much of an issue. Are you triggered by this? Do you need a safe space?
---
Only weak men are threatened by strong representation of women or, let's be generous to you again, an over representation of women in games. 
---
Because the over representation of women in games has happened WAY too often...
---
&gt;I’m 100% certain that if the OP just hit some anti duping flag, they’ll unblock him and apologize. 
---
Yeah no. Chances are 9 out of 10  they'll just close the ticket and don't even look at it.
---
There is a reason why they always ask for the account information on social media sites where a stink is made. They know they can't trust their actual review procedure.
---
False positives are generally shit out of luck unless they create outside pressure. And that's probably only 1 in a 100 or less.
---
&gt; Well, since tuesday's update I have twice failed to take public workshops because of enemies spawning underground, which is something they fixed in patch 4. 
---
Ok, haven't seen anyone else reporting that.  Bummer.
---
&gt;  It also seems like my character forgets which weapons he had equipped between logins, which also got fixed in patch 4.
---
There is a new bug reported where when you spawn in if you have two weapons of the same type favourited it forgets one of them.  Is that what you're seeing?
---
I, too, like supporting shit products and trying to defend my idiot choices online to validate myself. 
---
Well said!

Leave the golf clubhouse by walking by the fenced tennis court. It's the white stone domed looking thing with the lady with a pitcher statue on top of it. The water fountain is not in the center of this. It's under that dome/gazebo but on the side a little.

Do you know if the sulfur baths in the spa rooms of the assualtron robot whitespring spa/store can cure diseases as well?

The story is told, almost exclusively through Halo tape. Studies from all over the world have shown time and time again that most people, male and female prefer to hear women speak. 
---
Their engine is dog shit. This is what people mean when they say it
---
Yeah, pretty much. But games have come back from the dead before. ~\o/~ No Man's Sky did it, ESO did it. Maybe we can get some luck here
---
But they didn't, Few were expecting new Vegas because well? Obsidian develop that. Multiplayer FO4 perhaps, but that falls short. Things are limited,  enemies are still sponges/too time consuming for faster paced game,  their isn't interesting characters compare to other FO(yes, they did say that but last I checked teaming with ppl and doing quests is/was clunky). Server had multiple stability issues(which is cause of single player engine vs multi player). I'm sure there are plenty more issues I'm not aware of that I'm sure you are not looking at.
---
Stop being stupid.
---
That's not very specific. Weirdly how? Healing slower? Healing less?
---
You seemed to be very vindicated in your first comment on stimpaks being changed as if you had seen a change in the patch notes that corresponded to a change you had seen but your comments since then don't provide any sort of details that would help anyone understand what you're talking about.
---
This is such a good post and incredibly insightful. Breath of fresh air in this toxic environment filled with clowns thinking they have the best bad joke 😀
---
Did you immediately kite over a Scorchbeast to take out his damn house?
---
It unequips any armor you have on when entering power armor. So if you have extra carry weight with pocketed or deep pocketed armor it unequips it and your back to base carry weight.  
---
No offense but I’m pretty sure the description should read “fans with no self worth”. It must cause some sort of painful cognitive dissonance to have Paid for a GROSSLY unfinished game and continue to try and justify it and praise “fans who find work arounds” TO PLAY THE GAME NORMALLY. 
---
ITs like some weird cult of stupid that I’ve never seen before in regards to a *video game*. 
---
Hey look, it's someone who thinks being an asshole makes them important. Nothing of what I have said was for you. Hell, you get the TL:DR in the title. Yet here you are, acting all rude because you think that is what it takes to talk to people. So let me translate this into lay terms since I'm fairly certain you're missing the undertones. Be respectful and go away.
---
They could even have it use Cryo rounds!
---
Why?
---
A friend of mine irl used this same explanation for trying to excuse the duping and other exploits.
---
I reminded him that when you hack, exploit, etc single player games it potentially only affects that single instance and therefore really only affects the”pusher of the boundaries” cough cough.   When you do that to online game and destabilize the online server, you could be (and yes it happened here) affecting others gameplay.   That is one major difference I don’t think he even thought about.   Deliberate actions to destabilize the system is a violation of TOS.
---
Nice try.
---
In 2019 it's very difficult to tell if this is satire

Ding!

I can only solo them one at a time, with a non-legendary gauss rifle. People do seem to complain too much. 
---
step 1.  Finish your game and bugtest it BEFORE release
---
UNINSTALL!!!!
---
How is it a p2w? It's here for a week with the bonus then after that it's just like any other piece of clothing.
---
Stop making a mountain out of a mole hill

I don‘t know how your customer protections work over in US, but in Europe I have some solid rights to get what I paid for. So if McDonalds serves me shit (well, they to anyways), there is no arguing, they have to either give me some burgers or my money back.
---
OPs feelings about that are legit, I feel sorry too, for both sides. It‘s a shame Bethesda is not able to handle the mess. That’s inapropriate, disrespectful in some ways and heartbreaking too, for those loving the franchise. 
---
But on the other side, people scream „it‘s broken, I hate to play it! After 600+ hours I will scrap it and never return!“
---
After 600+ hours of fun, entertainment and excitement, obviously? Seriously, that‘s a legit amount of fun for 60 bucks to me. Like there is a human right saying videogames have to entertain me endlessly.
---
I hope so, it's a game with potential, but there is much to do
---
You can't die by them unless you hit them. Don't hit them.

High level players visit the area all the time and take out the CAMPs with turrets behind the clubhouse. The CAMPs without turrets and/or not immediately behind the clubhouse seem to get a pass. I'm CAMPed down by the snake icon and don't envy those with CAMPs closer to Whitesprings. The non stop worry of a nuke makes that a poor place for those looking for stability and safety. 
---
I had that bug once. Unfortunately, it was all plants (was working on a starch farm at the time).
---
I'm getting this same issue but I have LITERALLY no mods, whatsoever. My Fallout 4 is modded to the absolute shit house, but I have NO mods.
---
Yes, its a joke....but what its not broken right now? Guns, mutations, every patch they fix 3 bugs and adds 8 bugs. Just take a break like Im doing, come back in a few months. 
---
I remember when I first time played Beta and after putting on my Pip Boy, Overseer said "-- we are proud of you". From that point forward I knew something was wrong. Evidently all went to shit after most of the leaders became females. Nuclear war. Nukes everywhere. Not really. Probably head of the development just had dominating moms or something. 
---
Agree, there should be a free reset whenever major changes are made.
---
Ha ha ha plus 15 health to a max of 60 for less than a week is p2w?
---
Breaking story!
---
The world is ending!

Oh wait, health will drop back to standard after 1 week? 
---
But I want to use my earned atoms to be unstoppable forever

If you know of an online game that allows unlimited building with no budgets, I’m all ears. 
---
The only time I bulk is when I am getting ready to sell. Surprise surprise, Grahm came by my workshop tonight (junkyard across from Poseidon). I had a tinker bench so i bulked up a bunch of copper and cloth. It went into my inventory. I took too long. By the time I was done, Grahm despawned and I sold nothing. A mob of scorched attacked the workshop, so I had to defend. After looting and scrapping their weapons, of course i hit scrap all junk out of habit. Approx. 100 plastic gone. How was I supposed to know? There was no patch notes. I just did something that came so naturally i literally did not consider debulking a possibility.
---
I bought this game even after hearing all the bad things, reading this sub, and having less than zero expectations, and to tell you the truth it is one of the funnest games i ever played. It is also one of the most broken, and I can't defend it, but deep down I really do love this game. I payed 40 for this game and feel like i got my money's worth, bugs be damned. This isn't the first time I lost a whole bunch of caps or resources to bad code or lackluster testing. How many duplicate plans did I buy before the patch? How many times do I get kicked 10 minutes after decking out a workshop? It pisses me off, but I keep coming back. Many people are past that point, and I understand why. I'll say it again, i can not defend this game, but I really enjoy it. Don't know how this turned into a rant. Not trying to make waves, just wanted to share my experience.
---
Or you could go read the computer in paladin taggertys office at fort defiance. Gives armor plans there now. Still have to farm mods. But base plans are under a schematic entry on her computer. 
---
Or maybe they decided, after men destroyed the world with their nukes, that women should be in leadership positions rather than men.
---
Oh my!
---
Had this last night. Basically you have to delete the blueprint and start again. But your stuff will still be there just have to place back down
---
They sure are going to have a tough time selling that controller now!
---
Bethesda could never figure out how to do this justice. Best not to try.
---
The problem is your data on players loss is subjective and anecdotal.  You can't assume all player accounts posted here are legit. It's too common to have people rehash other's points as their own and there is rarely proof of anything that's claimed. There are also a few that are simply here to troll and add fuel to the fire. 
---
As far as nukes go, after I launched a couple, I stopped as its not super rewarding. After I got enough flux to craft underarmor it was better to farm non-nuked areas as there is less competition and you could hop around. 
---
I do think many players have left or stopped playing, but I don't think it's enough to make this subs base any more of a percentage of the whole. The main point of this post is to point out using this sub and nukes as a metric for player retention is flawed.
---
Yeah I learned that lesson after spending £100 odd on some poor as hell night vision goggles that game with Modern Warfare 2 back in the day. I did buy the Pip Boy edition of FO4 which I think was good quality and value but aside from that, I avoid collector's editions like the plague now.
---
I noticed that if you’re infected with radworms it changes demolition expert back to 100% at lvl5. 
---
Well you pay money for a temporary buff. Like a consumable stat booster.
---
But yes... the very first try for them to test to sell such items and boost your stats, is probably nothing evil... Bethesda wouldn't do such things, would they?
---
This is just the beginning.
---
Just like the DMV.  😂
---
Love for this, my friend! See u in Appalachia!
---
Wireless keyboard + controller
---
It’s insane, I know. 
---
You don't have 800 atom points? Why not they are easy to get. You don't have three friends to get the other outfits? That's on you. You don't have a keyboard to spell or Pay to Win? Now I know you're just lying. Instead of complaining online because your jimmies are rustled why don't you do something constructive? 
---
Well the damage bug for my bloodied explosive handmade is still not fixed completely. Sometimes it works, sometimes, I can fire like 10 bullets into a scorchbeast and its health would go down and then regenerate back to where it was. I really have no confidence Bethesda would ever be able to fix this
---
+1
---
Asking for a strong male character makes it sound like that isn't and hasn't been the standard for centuries. The reason the qualifier is used for women is to buck the norm of a leading figure to be a man or "masculine" 
---
The fact you noticed not to mention cared speaks volumes, and really itself explains why it's it's important in the first place. 
---
Why does it matter? 
---
You proved my point by making a list? 
---
Headline News: Bethesda did an “oopsie”.
---
In Other News:  Bethesda did another “oopsie”.
---
I’m beginning to feel a little sorry for them ... I mean, it’s getting a bit silly now.  This latest “hot fix” debacle just shows blind panic IMHO.
---
The hot fix introduced a new bug where if you have Bulked junk in your inventory it will be scrapped at a workbench. Bethesda have to be most incompetent company in the industry.
---
I have never had anything decent but I think my rng is broken because after over 300 hours I've yet to find a TSE not that they're of any use anymore although I do get plastic spoons and silver lockets
---
Downvoted over a joke.. Millennials 🙄
---
If you really want to see the cluster fuck mutations can be then share the strange in numbers perk and port any where you want, everything goes batshit crazy to the point where you need to quit to desktop to get anything back
---
Im laughing so hard reading op’s “IF YOU CANT BE CONSTRUCTIVE DONT BE HERE!!” comments. 
---
There’s nothing “constructive” about your whole wall of text. 
---
Bethesda doesn’t really need to do much, they’re working as much as they can on this game. The latest fixes have helped more than hurt, at least on my end. If you don’t like the game, stop supporting it! Grow up and stop acting a fool on an online forum. 
---
Why do you have to bash on other’s fun? There’s people still playing the game, why do we need to cater to you and, “STOP PLAYING THE GAME!!” You, a redditor who’s mom definitely didn’t burp him after his big ‘ol lunchy-poo. People see fun differently than you. 
---
And NONE of the other fallouts had DLC out by 3-4 months, fallout 4’s first real major DLC was Far Harbor, and that was a whole 7 months after launch. How can you tell me a linear storyline with the most boring side-quests had more of an endgame than fallout 76?? If you really did put 2000 hours into this game, put 2000 hours into actually going outside sometime maybe? Or invest another 83 days (Jesus Christ man 83 days in a game is depressing, I actually felt genuine sorrow for you when I read that. How can you get 83 days worth of content from a game and bitch about it), into ANOTHER game? 
---
There’s something constructive friend, do with it what you will. Hopefully you’ll learn that the door to your windowless hobble actually opens, and you can take a step outside for once. 
---
I love the CAMP module around no problem, just enter edit mode and move as you would a couch or whatever....
---
I know of a bunch that have seemingly no or much higher budgets than what we are limited to in this game. But I also understand there are probably limitations with the engine and hardware.
---
haha have you played the witch free or felldown las vegas they are best games made by CDGod-jectRed and Godsidian and have no flaws whatsoever and any criticism no matter how valid is completely wrong geraldo is best story character and mailman is the best player designed character!!!!!!!
---
Lol this reminds me of my undergraduate 2 man coding projects.... Cannot believe a top level game company makes these kinds of mistakes too. I honestly find this funny
---
Also, can we sort armor by what it’s protecting instead of alphabetical order or weight? I spend minutes comparing one left leg to another left leg or Trail Warden to a different chest piece. For newbs like me it’s hard to remember all the specific names with armor and food. When my dude is hungry and needs extra carry weight, I think “meaty something” not “grilled radstag” or “mole rat chunks” which are like 20 spaces apart. 
---
I found many plan. It require a lot of luck to increase your chances.
---
ThanksObama flashback
---
I have about 35 treasure maps, that's how much good stuff you get....I don't bother with them...
---
I think there's a cure for the Scorched plague. Possibly in the future we will go around injecting the cure into the Scorched humanoids and they become interactable NPCs. That's my dream.
---
People have clipped into those rooms and nothing was there. 
---
I tried to be open minded, but i don't feel a purpose to play it more, completing quests barely gives any rewards, players just reunite at the golf to level up and nothing more,  the bugs don't bother me much, it's just the lack of objectives and things to do, the pvp barely exists so who cares? just to build a house on a huge map? I spend 50+ hours playing the game till i decided to try MHW, totally forgot about fo76 and currently don't feel like coming back for now, hope they make changes.
---
I would contend fo1 dogmeat is the best. Canonically he dies helping you save the world.
---
Well, she was Overseer before the nukes, do that makes no sense from a lore perspective. 
---
Doesn’t change that OP is a douche. 
---
At least you know your friends have shit taste in games now and to buy things they dislike and avoid things they suggest.
---
I work until 3pm est today, so I’ll be on by 3:30. 
---
I want achievements too... Stupid non-steam launcher...
---
took me.290 hours to find a tse..a tse laser pistol lol..whick only firea about 50 rounds before it breaks

So every update they do?

It's not bad. It used to be great for camp plans probably still is. I heard collecting the same treasure too quickly can bug your inventory. 
---
I have so many I just don't feel like pulling up their locations on the internet lol. The hi TS are pretty vague unless they have a huge landmark in them

Or when her body disappears in 1 minute while your loot is still loading and the meat pile is nowhere to be found...

They fit on top of half walls and, for the ones that look upside down, they attach to the underside of free-floating upper-level floors.
---
Good on you for assuming that the OP is a “man”. Without wanting to get into a gender debate, I’ll admit that I assumed the OP was a boy. 
---
You're a little late to the party. Have you been sleeping the past few days?
---
Probably because most of the player base left after the last patch. 
---
Am I the only one sitting on over 2000 atom with everything I want already purchased 
---
It's stupid easy to make atom in this game 
---
There is no pay to win in this game lol if you need to buy atom you just suck at the game 
---
It's or a copy-paste from Fallout 4 or the prelude of a beautiful update
---
And you'll be on here defending them the next time they pull this crap.
---
Once all challenges are completed and you earn atom the normal way, it takes quite some time to get them. Then you have to do all quests and events, daily, don't miss one and you get per week and how much do you get? Do you know that? How long will it take to buy something for 800 atoms? Probably you don't.
---
More such items will come to the shop and if you don't pay money... well...
---
I bought the silver shroud costume with free atoms because it looked cool, I don't give too hoots about the stat boost, I don't wear it because of it lol.
---
There's things I want for this game too: player vending, less stutter, some team missions or raids, factions (*I think we should have been made to choose 1 faction to join instead of all - hoping this comes back in for raids*), better energy weapons, increase stash and camp build limit, more wall and roof selections for camp, more relevance for some special stats (*why, why, why did I go for 15 intelligence?? I thought it would let me craft more items than another player and be a vendor!*)... and I'm sure most of this will come. I'm just playing the game in the mean time to have fun and doing what's available now.
---
But yes any little thing is hugely overblown in this place. At first it was just r/fallout but this place has been taken over by people often posting straight up lies. Yesterday somebody (upvoted a lot btw) replied to another user saying "*I saw your credit card details*" because of Bethesda. No. No you didn't. No credit card data was shared when there was the support mess up. I think addresses were shared - and that's just **not ok**... but why lie? That user probably didn't even have any part in the data issue (*also, wasn't it a handful of people too? Genuine question out to anybody bothering to read this*). But why make this up??
---
Loads of things have turned out to be lies. The trade glitch. And apparently there is no encryption in 76 traffic (which there is), so we'll all get hacked and our characters ruined. None of that's true. Why are people doing this? There's genuine reasons to be angry, like the canvas bag (*although I think Beth are fixed that after all -* **which they should**). Why muddy the water with lies when there's actual reasons to be upset? People are actively defending people using cheat engine and duping items, saying it's Bethesda's fault- I'll never agree with that. That's on the player, with Bethesda's responsibility to stamp it out. But apparently banning cheats from 76 is a bad thing. Pfffft you don't get this with other online games. You cheat = you banned. That's on you. It's not ok *because canvas bag*.
---
I looked at the users posting most of the gilded posts here trying to stir up more anger. Most of them less than a month old. Who is making a new account to stir up problems on a game sub? Why bother??
---
The biggest piece of feedback on launch was that the pacifist mode was "broken". *I can't RP a raider, this sucks* or *this hand holding mode is pathetic*. Well they've added a mode for that. Fine, get those people off our servers and onto ones where they can do that. But guess what? That's apparently a waste of time because we just have dozens of posts saying they shouldn't have bothered. Well let's see if anybody uses it first before you call it wasted dev time.
---
We've been complaining about TSE weapons being stupid and ruining the game. It's been long overdue (that sounds ridiculous- the game has only been put 2 months) but they've finally balanced that and said they are looking at energy weapons too (also needed). But apparently that's enough to get 100 "I'm done with this game" comments every day on various posts. Go play another game if you want to feel like a god. That's not survival and It's not this game- it was never meant to be. TSE was a fuckup but they've fixed it now (btw those weapons are still much better than other weapons - I've been trying out all sorts). People were genuinely saying all other weapons should be buffed to TSE levels. I'm not even going to start on what's wrong with that.
---
The obvious and obnoxious answer to most of these here is "*Oh, people have different opinions? Wow.*" but that misses the point. PVP was demanded and shouted about on launch. This place was full of criticism for the pacifist mode. Where are those people now to defend the new mode and say they are glad? Where are the people to defend the TSE balancing? Because most people posting wanted it. Again the obvious but lazy reply is "*People only post when they are angry.*" but the defending of the balancing is actively down voted here. It's overwhelmingly negative about those specific changes with very few defending.
---
Apparently we're shills because we wanted it and it happened.
---
Sorry for a wall of text. I know I'll be down voted. It's just so strange seeing people making shit up when there's legit stuff we can be pissed off about. 
---
I want to get deeper into this discussion...but “Halo” tape is awesome. 
---
IMO, a woman’s voice is more soothing...but what do you mean by “prefer to hear”? Based on what? In every scenario? What is your source?
---
I haven't seen any reports on that either, this is just a few things that I myself have seen return since tuesday. I haven't really had the time to make my own bug report on it, and I'll wait until I've had a chance to see if these issues are handled by the hotfix. 
---
I do not have two weapons of the same type favourited, so no. What happens is that when I log in, my character remembers the weapon he was holding when I logged out, but not the "hotswap" weapon and not the throwable (you know, grenades or throwing weapons). This was in the game from the start, but after patch 4 my character would consistently remember both the active and the "hotswap" weapon as well as the throwable. This went away again with patch 5. 
---
(I'm probably carrying around too many weapons as usual, to be honest, but at least they are all of different types. On the other hand, it's useful to have some backup in case of breakage or ammo shortage... gah)
---
Nah that handily goes to Wildcard/grapeshot
---
I don't have any blueprints.... Not even the last cabin I've build. 😱
---
Bethesda have to be the most incompetent company in the gaming industry. 
---
Removed because of "exploits." Allegedly.
---
Modus
---
Even with the occasional bug here and there, i am having a good time with the game, and most of my enjoyement comes from my idea that Fallout 76 is not meant to be rushed nor grinded , it Will not give you instant rewards like most games nowaday, i try to never use fast travel (have found all sorts of weird things that are not even marked as locations on the map including the random encounters), i turn off the music and only let the ambience sound play, i love the way i can hear far away combat from other players or npc, and when a nuke falls i try to run to a high place to try and see the explotion from afar... I like a Lot of the small details from the game, the exploration, the story behind the environments, holotapes and text, and i am always trying to help other players , give them plans and recipies to make them trust me and stick with them for awhile. For me it's been a good experience so far, With all and it's flaws. I'm not so obsessed like others to actually try to do the math in every and all updates the developers put out, most of them i dont even notice , and when i do notice something that doesn't benefit muy gameplay i adapt to it, just like real life, if the rules change , then i change , either way the game is going to be fixed eventually, because we are helping to shape it with our feedback. I really hope that the small team of developers working on this game learns a lot from this experience and make this game great for all of us to enjoy even more.
---
Maps got me all the piece plans for T51b so I can make all the Nuka Cola armor so I'd say the maps are pretty dang good
---
One of the costumes you get in game completing a quest line. Easy.
---
I would understand nerfing TSE Shotguns, so that they explode only once like one additional explosive pellet instead of having a clusterbomb cannon.
---
Other TSE weapons were pretty much fine when compared to Melee, and even then they were still weak without Bobbles.
---
I have seen players onehit scorchbeasts without a meta build, just by using the basic perks, no bobbleheads or whatever. Meanwhile my TSE Gauss needed like 10 shots to kill a Scorchbeast, IF the hit was actually detected and IF the regeneration bug didnt happen. Sneak attacks? forget it. never seen it working once in a while now without triggering the regen bug.
---
Even i can oneshot lv 60 Supermutants with my Axe, and i have no STR and not Melee Perks equipped. My Gauss needs several shots to the head.
---
So much for balance.
---
I haven't had an issue with healing factor, but I have at one point lost the jumping ability from Marsupial. 
---
I wasn't in a team though, so that discounts strange in numbers. What DID happen though, was that I recovered naturally (ie no disease cure) from a disease, I think radworms, but might have been something else. 
---
Came back when I logged in later in the day, though. 
---
Getting a little desperate. I don’t have any friends who play this.
---
I hate joining an event late like power up power soandso plant and suddenly without notice be rewarded with the fusion generator plans. It is awful.
---
Hell no the invisibility isn’t good for anything. It’s just a bug that’s being overlooked. Other players can still see you as if you aren’t invisible, but you just can’t see yourself, and it caries over into other sessions if you can’t figure out how to reverse it. I’ve coached other redditors on how to reverse this effect because some don’t know what even triggered them being permanently invisible in the first place. It’s useless, but isn’t getting fixed because Bethesda doesn’t know about it. 
---
Not a single one.
---
Curious what you mean "go through certifications", other then possibly needing to be PCI compliant for micro-transactions, what other compliance would they be looking to achieve?
---
As to fire their staff, and hire modders, isn't something I have heard anyone declare, I believe the argument people have been putting forward, is that there is a large community of modders who in their own right, follow very similar development work flows, so they would have some similar experience to draw on to make the criticisms about Bethesda releasing a poorly implemented game.
---
Giving Bethesda a minute to make it right is a hard pill to swallow by many, since you need to consider as it's been over 3 months, and from everything I have read, there are still a large number of bugs as well as balancing issues.
---
**Saying all that I have said I will give some validations to your points:**
---
Modders usually (not always) will have freedoms that industry game developers will not have, as industry game developers will usually have to adhere to publisher timelines, expectations and what not. 
---
Going hand in hand with that though, developers are responsible also to make publishers have realistic expectations, which publishers should pass on to their audiences, now for FO 76 I don't know who is to blame, but just from a purely external, uninformed (in the sense I'm not in their offices), I would guess it's a bit of both.
---
Although it has been 3 months, in that time Bethesda has been pushing patches to address bugs left right and centre, there is no doubt they are working hard to try and get as many things fixed as they can.
---
Eii saa peita
---
Damn. You lost me at “did you done”. 
---
If you have an opinion worth hearing, try harder. 
---
Pretty awful idea imo
---
Tho I'm mostly pissed there's no casual matchmaking.
---
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HANG AROUND TEAMMATES. WHY DON'T PEOPLE JOIN TEAMS?!
---
Sorry for the caps lol but why are there so many multiplayer features that everyone can't engage in. Why not allow for matchmaking? Charisma would be amazing and change my play style if I always could count on some bonuses.
---
Remove lone wanderer or nerf.it. it's way too useful and people would rather play solo without the benefits of being "teamed up"
---
Says the person upset because people don't like his fallout game.
---
&gt; GameStop are running a promotion in Germany, Austria and Switzerland where anyone buying a used PlayStation 4 or Xbox One controller gets a free copy of the online shooter.
---
LOL "online shooter". 
---
It won't enable PvP.
---
Did you notice that the next far cry is going to be set in a nuclear apocalypse?
---
I consistently seemed to manage to keep turning up at those events where a player had started, then seemingly changed their mind.
---
Took me a good 4-5 attempts before I managed to complete one.
---
Oh fortune teller of reddit please give me the lotto numbers for Saturday's drawing.
---
There is piece (under "Stairs") that looks like a slanted foundation... I haven't tested it myself yet, but I'd assume the slanted wall attaches to it.
---
You can relocate the CAMP around your built abode but I don’t think you can move it to a different spot on the map without building it all over again. 
---
I haven't had a chance to log in since the hotfix, but I have noticed that my character seems to get hungry and thirsty quicker since patch 5 even with the metabolism and dromedary perks active. I haven't timed it, so I don't know if it really is quicker or I'm just not paying attention, though. 
---
This. They're useful for plugging up holes made by using slanted walls or using roof pieces that doesn't quite fit together but these let you seal up your house. It's kinda hard to explain 
---
I had 3 about 12 hours ago.
---
awesome, thx for info!
---
Why are you implying that the original poster is threatened? It seems like a valid observation, in my opinion. 
---
Wow I need to step my game up
---
Like if you put one of the triangle pieces on the ground the others can fit on top making a full wall or whatever you're trying to use on top. 
---
Well, the modern casual gamer wants to have everything served for free and without effort on a Silver platter. Immediately. 
---
God beware the loooooong grind to get such a huge number of Atoms as you need for one of these costumes ..
---
They usually covered my cost of fast travelling to Whitespring to sell stuff. It was nice.
---
Coffee? Off the top of my head, I know it spawns at the little guard/gate house between the circular driveway and the tarmac at Wade Airport (listen for the radio as it's always turned on).
---
lol calling this person untintelligent when both of your comments are absolutely riddled with cringeworthy spelling and grammatical errors.
---
There's no fucking way you got hired as a game developer anywhere.
---
:o 
---
At least you got TSE I had to buy mine, I'm 7 lvls away from 200 and never had one drop best I had drop was lvl 35 double barrel explosive junkie shotgun.
---
It is , im working on making a complete list as it seems we're finding more and more each day. And as far as looking for drop rates you wont be able to on console as you need a pc to actively look in the games code. Your best bet for spawn rates and drop information is incindar.com. Again, is not a complete list, but no one really has one yet if we're being honest. Hope this helps.
---
Few days ago Im pretty sure I had 3 
---
TSE? Oh it's good now. It's the melee that needs to be balanced.
---
Ugh, took me a min bc i didnt understand the directions from previous posts. Exit the dmv, head straight, go left around that buliding (hug the wall) to the back side where there is a half burried post box (the old green style ones on the bottom of the enbankment) piece of junk mail is in there
---
100% agree with this!!! Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
Have you tried taking Daytrippers? First time I tried it I got a 3* Bloodied Minigun with explosive bullets, and +1 agility. 
---
Works better on randomly spawned creatures. 
---
I’ve gotten a tse 10mm sub, and a 3* flamer with explosive bullets. All under Daytrippers 
---
Why is the OP a douche? They asked a simple question, politely and respectfully. You’ve then resorted to calling them names. Your bigotry is ironic and your virtue signalling is rather nauseating.
---
TL;DR in the end.
---
I don't care about money. I've worked hard all my life to reach a point, where money doesn't mean anything anymore.  A game could cost 60 or 600 Euros, it wouldn't make a difference. I just care about time, because I live in the second half of my life and don't have enough left of that.   
---
When I buy a premium product, I expect excellence, perfect service and the little cherry on top that makes me say "ahhh".  
---
I own a BMW ... not because I want to drive faster than others, show off my wealth or have weird problems with my self esteem. I drive that car because it is a premium product and I didn't encounter a single problem in the last 30 years of driving BMWs. Their products are excellent in any field, their service is flawless and there is always that little extra that makes me say "ahhh". I enjoy the product.
---
During my years as a student I drove crappy cars that I had bought cheap. I didn't expect much of those cars and they had problems quite frequently. No big deal. I could name other premium products in other fields but I guess you get my point.  
---
Bethesda on the other side is a premium company selling a premium product in their field of business. But their product stinks and has too many flaws to even mention them all. Bethesda is a AAA company and their games sell for a premium AAA price. They enjoy their image as "Gods of environmetal storytelling" and "allmighty owners of the legendary Fallout franchise". I expect more from them than what they've delivered to us.
---
If an indy studio would have programmed and designed Fallout 76, they wouldn't have done a job much worse than those so called AAA professionals. What Bethesda delivered with Fallout 76 is a joke of a product and a new low for the videogame industry. I don't care what studio did it, what problems they've encountered and who they had to hire to fix those... they failed.
---
Their communication is slow and they act suprised about everything half of the time. ("Oh, you guys would like to have transparent and complete information in some sort of patch notes... whoopsie, that's new to us"). In the beginning it was quite visible that they didn't even had a set plan on how to communicate with their playerbase. How pathetic is that? We are talking about a AAA company in 2019 for crying out loud. I can't even count how many times they had to say "sorry" during the last few weeks. Anybody remember the nylon bags?
---
Yes, many of us can enjoy the game and spend countless hours filled with FUN. I get that and respect it. I am happy for everyone who loves the game. I have spent many hours ingame, too. Time wasted with a failed and bug filled product.   
---
I just can't respect Bethesda anymore. The management there should be replaced by decision makers who know what they are doing, the whole communication department should get fired and ... sorry ... the devs seem to be a bunch of "not so qualified" people, too. They hammer out stupid amateur mistake after mistake after mistake. With every patch I shake my head in disbelief that something like that can even happen. QA? Never heard of something like that. Test Servers? What is that?  
---
I get it. Online games are complicated. Guess what!? A BMW with all the different systems, assistants and features is complicated, too. That's no excuse. 
---
TL;DR: Bethesda is a company in a bad state and their newest product stinks. Consumers can expect WAY more from a leading AAA company selling a AAA game for a AAA price. The disapointment is not about the money. It's about Bethesda and the lousy state of the videogame industry.
---
Stored structures.
---
Okay glad I wasn't tripping, cause yeah I've noticed. I stepped out of my room for a sec to do something and came back to my character's AP fully red.
---
Patience you must have, my young Padawan. 
---
Thank you! I’ll be looking 
---
Gotcha
---
I got a two-shot fatman for one punching a robot in Watoga an hour ago, seems fine to me
---
I dont get this. With a non Legendary Dragon for the opening shot and then a regular hardened lever and hardened handmade, scorbeasts die in less than 3 min with maybe a couple clips of ammo used. That seems fairly reasonable. Sure they’re not being two shot like with the old fully maxed TSE’s but that seems to prove even more that those were out of whack. 
---
There's plenty. I'll try and remember in a few.. I don't think spawn are consistant. I've gone to test if Caps would respawn and they weren't there at all. 
---
I've also had them not spawn, I turn around and the tin is there magically. 
---
Gee, I dunno maybe springs, lead, acid, and anything else I may need. Why waste caps on junk, that is about the dumbest thing I have ever heard, well maybe ballistic cloth if you don't have 10 bulked up for later use. 
---
Pigs are way more inteligent than dogs......
---
Cool
---
But you’re building a new character and not taking points away from your main?
---
With all the unstable perk changes I’d say keep your old  and build a new one.
---
For now is time of the repo man, a golden age that shall never end
---
Good luck then with handmade and lever rifle mods.
---
Yes the favourites wheel is having major issues since update
---
You are mistaken Modus male voice and main character 
---
just really want to get in to them :(
---
so why even nerf it.  just delete it and pretend it never existed.  im attempting a pretty fair solution here.  you must agree that the 25% thing is just downright silly.  it's called two shot for a reason... it fires two rounds... why not take that premise up a notch and making it a bit more balanced by actually costing two rounds.  this isnt really meant to be a solution for OP level 200 players.  they most likely can respec any which way to sunday and smack an SBQ twice with a sledge and the proper build so why ruin a great perk for mid level casual players almost solely because of its popularity
---
If you play on Xbox can I have all your caps pls and thank
---
I am a part of the majority that likes the game, but I am not a silent one. I am here to laugh at the haters and I laugh loud.
---
Browsing twitter in 2019 almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
If it was a perminant boost then we'd have something to complain about but it isn't and tbh a boost of 15 health is absolutely nothing.
---
It's nothing compared to the game breaking stats we have in melee at the moment 
---
Did it last night had 3 legendary
---
All that budget and thats what he does with it? I guess theres no accounting for taste. 
---
Just checked, sits at ~50GB.
---
Go ask anyone who's never played the game. They'll tell you all about it
---
there is coffee in the fridge in the flatwoods pub 
---
Damn. Thats fucked. Ive seen a post with the same problem before. BGS should probably know about this.
---
I got your point and totally agree. However not even the average player wants shitty guns with low damage to deal with spongy ants where it takes two entire magazines to kill an insect. 
---
They had to buff other guns to a TSE level not nerfing TSE to a shitty level. 
---
No, but I was up killing snallygasters for acid and had picked them up since I saw them. It also makes for quick purified water on the fly if you run out or get low and don't want to rtb for more. The main thing, I hate that something that only has limited use gets automatically scrapped when it ia a pain in the ass to farm in the first place. 
---
I have done about 100 or so treasure maps. I got a couple of plans for Power Armor pieces. Other than that I dropped/vendored the rest of the loot. I felt like Cranberry Bog/Mire maps had the most valuable loot. So maybe consider doing only those two regions.
---
Canned coffee is pretty rare. I believe scavenging bars/cafes might be the best option. Around Super Duper Mart in Watoga, Top of the World tower's bottom floor and camps usually have some.
---
Well actually you wrong. When I say things like melee still doing 15k dmg or that range weapons are ruined I get ppl that are dumbfounded and has no idea how melee is doing 15k. 
---
That just shows here are some 37lvl blebber also
---
I can confirm that.
---
This exactly. Non legendary Dragon for opening shot then lever and handmade combo to kill it. Liberal use of VATS. They die in a few min. People whining about using 1000s of rounds of ammo and taking 10 min are either exaggerating or have significant other issues with their build/strategy
---
“Douche” May have been a bit strong, I’ll concede that. So, allow me to rephrase:
---
The “polite, respectful “ question nothing was nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt at inciting “left vs right” mud-slinging, and therefore  will garner no respect from me. 
---
No, you're right. 
---
The balance of probability of someone with the username MattRandall160 isn't male probably isn't that high, right? Also women complaining about a company being too PC for over-representing their own gender is pretty frequent, right?
---
Sorry, my bad. /s
---
Yesterday I only got 2 legendaries despite hearing the announcement for all 3 supervisors. Weird 
---
I pre-ordered it for myself and a copy for my friend. Stopped playing after a week... -_-
---
So fucking sick of the shilling an vote manipulation on this site. Getting really fucking sick of it.
---
Not sure if they're "laughing all the way to the bank".  The game has been a flop with bad reviews and scores and their reputation has been badly damaged and they had a lot of bad PR - trust is not so easily bought.  
---
I was eagerly anticipating the next ES game, but hearing it's running on the same engine and after this disaster I'm definitely not buying it at full-price day 1 or earlier -- normally I would have done, and I bet I'm not the only one who will hold off for a discount.
---
Sure, they made money off the pre-orders on FO76, but I'm certain too there were also plenty of refunds and they've ruined the potential $$$ they could make on the launch weeks of future titles.  Are they making bank?  Absolutely.  Are they making their projected bank numbers????  Very likely not, especially with their heavy discounts a week after launch.  
---
They could have made $60+ off me for ES6, now they'll be lucky to get half of that.  That might be a drop in the ocean to them, but that drop becomes a splash that will affect their bottom line, because I am sure I am not the only one.
---
You really don't know much about game development, you can test all you want with the minimal 100-300 developers but until it's in the hands of millions of players doing different things, even purposely trying to break the game it's hard to notice on mistakes done from a previous patch. 
---
Rust?  I've seen some insane large towns/castles on there.
---
wow..where can i find daytrippers?
---
I have the same thing but where when I activate my pip boy it breaks my game and i cant move but if i go to another character its fine
---
they should make that a feature, id GLADLY spend 5K caps for a plan that lets me build an arm mod to use power fist style weapons in power armor
---
I just got serendipity from a perk pack and as soon as I did I started getting the icon that its parking. Shit is fucking weird 
---
Thank you! 
---
Well I guess I have a new game to play called where the fuck did all my memory go you guys r right tho it's only 52. I could sworn all those patches had it somewhere in the 150 range before. Thanks for the info!
---
iv done uranium fever and gotten no legendaries once..but most times i get 3...sometimes 2
---
Let's not pretend we here are highly representative of the overall gaming populous of this game. We're a very vocal minority.
---
I'd be very curious to see if the drop in reddit players is even significant. Like if we held a one-day boycott, would anyone in Bethesda even notice?
---
When it downlaods updates it needs additional space to extract and check the files downloaded, this is the console at work though, not Bethesda...
---
Yeah ..wish that water filter had more then 1 use. Even IRL a camping water filter would last for at at least 1000l.
---
I rarely find them unless I throw on pharma farma. 
---
I usually ask everyone for them 
---
Lmao ok 
---
Why do people keep saying that Bethesda has no experience with online games? Was Elder Scrolls: Online not an online, multiplayer game. I understand that Zenimax is the developer but Bethesda Softworks published it. Did publishing that game gain them nothing in the online market?
---
The “/s” has me a little unsure about the spirit of your post, so I’ll tentatively point out that I never suggested the OP wasn’t male, and leave it there...
---
Rad-x now suppresses mutations. Wasn’t in patch notes. 
---
I thought it did that pre-patch AND "hotfix"? I was always careful to remove bulk. 
---
Not saying I like it. Not defending an old issue. Don't hate the player hate the game. ✌️ Don't all jump on me for pointing out a thing ✌️
---
But surely you can see, that the only ‘mud’ slinging that’s been done, so far, has been by you, calling the OP a douche etc?
---
Instead of asking him to clarify their questions, or seeking further details from him/her, you immediately denounced them and started being insulting.
---
There’s an irony here...
---
what did they break this time?
---
ok..will look into that..thnx
---
Yeah I found one where a body had explosives hidden in it. Perception warned me.
---
I would have have to travel from finland. Would cost about 1500 to get 60 back. So they can keep it lol
---
Nothing stops you. 
---
Oh ok so it doesnt use the space persay but in a way you need some extra room. Just trying to understand so I can do what I can without deleting games all the time. When I get some $ I will be getting a harddrive so I dont have to worry about this anymore
---
Well I've ordered Crack down 3 that comes out on the 15th February, if bethesda don't pull their fingers out by then n sort this mess out I'll quit Fallout 76, only have 8 achievements to finish as it is......... 
---
If I recall correctly, male voices activate parts of the brain that cause more tension; female voices activate the same parts that process music.
---
Those mangler fish that hang out near Grafton are just that.
---
You can still use a fishing rod but i doubt it will do any damage lolz
---
I noticed I was constantly is \[CAUTION\] when sneaking.  I thought I must be overlooking the enemies or something, even when I'm in the middle of nowhere, but I guess I should have realised straight away that Bethesda probably borked it somehow lol
---
i love it when people throw away spoiled food. they eventually become nuka nades
---
Why are you scrapping those items? It wastes plastic and doesn't save weight. The only items that it does save weight on are aluminum,  lead and maybe steel? I forget. I only scrap aluminum and that goes in my stash. I only bulk items when I am literally ready to sell them. 
---
When doing things like building power armor it can be much easier to buy things like springs since you need so many. I have often bought junk if I'm just short for a mod or repairs.
---
[pop](https://cheezburger.com/7154045696/bunny-eating-popcorn) 
---
Just fast travel for 50 caps
---
Yes. Without seeing any science as proof, I’d agree with your statement.
---
Doesn’t answer my question though. 
---
Another shitshow waiting to happen I guess.
---
Cause double damage which works with other legendary perks too was too strong? 
---
true. if they're going to ruin our fun, at least do it evenly.
---
Havent used any radx but good to know
---
Wow you guys will literally complain about everything
---
I do want the game dont get me wrong but right now i don't have additional funds for it, i also my PS+ sub just ended so now I have to pay money for that plus the game which blows. Right now there's just other games that are out that i want to play like RE2 Remake and Kingdom hearts 3 and potentially Sekiro later this year :(
---
Hahaha 😂 good one lol
---
Reality is complicated. Out there the meaning changes all the time. 
---
Originally it meant "apply a fix/change without needing to reboot the whole system / transparent to the end user". Now can either mean a quick fix that addresses a more or less severe issue in the software.
---
I think Bethesda marketing uses the term correctly in that way, but maybe they should avoided it
---
Eg.

You can try windirstat, shows very nicely exactly what takes space and where. 
---
? 
---
I think team size should be based on the leaders charisma. 9 charisma you can have 3 other teammates, 15 charisma you can have 5 other teammates. 1 charisma, you’re an asshole and no one will follow you.
---
right with you buddy... though bugs have been present since then are still very much there...
---
I’ve been able to do this before the hot fix. A week ago
---
Nice. Well I have had to buy my tools three times now. I had all new stuff, but had to sell when moving from Phoenix to Alabama due to constraints on shipping. I then picked up a bunch of tools from garage sales and trade days that they have down there. I then moved from Alabama to my wife's hometown in Illinois. I decided to make the move in two trips. I left everything for the second trip locked in my workshop. I get back down to Alabama and my so called friends and neighbors had cut the doors off my shop since they couldn't cut the lock and took everything I had. I had taken most of my hand tools in case I had a mechanical problem on the road, but all of my saws, sanders, power equipment, my zero-turn and my 4 wheeler were all gone. I wasn't worried about theb4 wheeler,  I only had $200 into it, but the rest I was really pissed about. I didn't have the time to dick around with the LEOs and having been on the FD, I pretty much knew that a couple of them had some of my stuff anyway. I just left. Now I have my shop going again and all of my power tools, except my battery operated stuff is second hand and I have no problems with any of it. I just have to make it so that I can function in there during the winter. 
---
I don't even have 100h in the game, so you could say I am a casual. I'm very happy with most of the nerfy, especially TSE, as players just killed legendaries one shot right in front of me all the time. There are certainly things in the update that I don't like, like the bobby pin weight increase and some other things, but I don't think that the update is mostly bad, I think it's mostly good. 
---
right now people are drooling over Bloodied builds, bloodied + nerd rage + Adrenal reaction + other stuff, basically the glass cannon setup.
---
toss in some sentinel and assassin's gear to stand in one spot taking little to no damage
---
&gt;!also, power armor in PVP is not something you see often. due to no legendary power armor!&lt;
---
Agreed! I don't like how fishing works in ESO though as that's just boring and annoying. 
---
Maybe if they do it WoW style. 
---
I've had that problem in the past, usually I relog or something and it fixes itself. My main problem is the fall damage I take after I go skywalking. I've jumped off the lighthouse next to vault 76 with bird bones and taken minor damage, but somehow when I'm super jumping + walking the damage I get when I land kills me every time. 
---
If you haven't gotten it yet I highly recommend the class freak perk. It makes being a mutant so much easier.
---
Lmao this is definitely an interesting concept, but unfortunately I don't think it would be implemented specifically like this due to not everyone having the same amount of charisma
---
Aww, am I s’posed to feel bad?
---
Why is not knowing what min-maxing is relevant? It’s relevant because while all the complaining loudmouths are obsessing about how much Bobby Pins weigh and whether they can one-shot the end-game Boss, I’m quietly off having fun traipsing around Appalachia enjoying myself. 
---
Y’all need to chill. 
---
Browsing this subreddit makes me think we deserve it
---
That's just flat out wrong. Pre patch you didnt need to be specced for it and you'd still 1-2 shot everything regardless of what kind of TSE weapon you had. Even post patch I'm still 1 shotting all normal enemies and now it takes 2 shits instead of 1 for a MQ and SB now take like 5 and Just using normal cards for damage like tank killer, lvl1 rifleman cards, and bloody mess. 
---
Treesize Free is a good one also. Find those pesky 12 gb temp files Windows Updates tucks away.
---
yes you must download it
---
/r/GamersRiseUp 
---
Watch out though, I hear Chad works for B[EA]thesda. 
---
you used the term "cuck" in relative to people who enjoy a game and used the example of trying to break a multiplayer game map as the pinnacle of human nature wtf are you talking about idiot.
---
Wouldn’t just not logging in have the same impact? It’s not like it’s taking the money spent on the game back from them. 
---
I played the beta on ps4 and when the game was released I was a few missions in but didn't get the trophies for completing them. That explains some of the 12% not leaving the vault
---
Bethesda MD actually loads into a separate cell and with the current state of things I don't think I'd risk it. Well probably get disconnected before we reach the front door. 
---
"The term "hotfix" originally referred to software patches that were applied to "hot" systems; that is, systems which are live, currently running, and in production status rather than development status."  
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotfix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotfix)
---
Why don't you keep your to yourself?
---
The vast majority of plans in game you can find somehow somewhere
---
👏👏
---
I agree completely! There are far too many whiners that don't understand these things (games) are finite experiences. I mean shit, if I get 60 hours of fun for $60, that's perfect to me. I'm nearing the 400 hour mark already, so I won't even begin to complain about it.
---
Sure, I would like a less messy experience, like most others, but I've had my fun and, even if I were to never play it another moment, \~400 hours for $60 is **incredibly** good for me!
---
I'm one of those people that has a ton of stuff to sell. Usually if I hear someone I get off cause I know I hate waiting for people so I just try and be nice.
---
Sorry that your dreams of being a video game tester were shattered by the early access paradigm, bro.
---
reverse psychology 
---
How much is  "a Bunch" ?  
---
As much as I despise you hoarders, this would be a good thing.
---
Got a 440 cap bounty the other night doing that exact same thing.  Doing the "right thing" is way too costly now.. with the plan price explosion.
---
Going to hoof it over to the fissure site nearby and kite a SB over next time.
---
Amen. 
---
Okay, it went from saying 66 ballistic 66 energy to 33 ballistic 33 energy. Whether or not it actually did that much damage, I have no idea. I'm not even sure the game actually adds the two damage types together, because now when I shoot a scorchbeast it's like trying to start pvp. My tesla rifle is better.
---
&gt; They fix the "bugs" that people like, but don't fix the bugs people complain about such as incessant Scorchbeast spam.
---
That's a lot of it I think.  They've picked some very...interesting..."problems" to focus their attention on.  I agree White Knight was probably too good, but why pick *that* to adjust rather than some of the really questionable perks like the "Quick Hands", which not only should probably be a flat rate increase but also in Agility.  They did the right thing with "All Night Long" and "Fireproof" - made them much more relevant.  We need more of that.
---
Don't even get me started on the Legendary perks.  If I pick up a "Mutant Slayer" weapon that sucker better be dealing +100% damage to that very specific mob type.  We don't have enough stash space to be monkeying around with narrow weapons with weak effects.
---
Do you have a picture of it because I’m confused where your talking about
---
44 this year and it’s my 30th anniversary of owning an intel based PC.
---
I’ll concede (again) that “douche” was unfair. After several Friday afternoon pints of American Pale Ale, that’s as close to an apology as you’re going to get.
---
My reluctance to respect the content/topic of the original post remains, but I do appreciate your efforts in helping me reign in my drunken hypocrisy. 
---
It's the only thing people are talking about and it's getting fucking grating. 
---
yuou are a cuck if you don't agree with me. That's life now.
---
Thank you for your point of view. And mine is not so different.
---
Just to mention it: I have seen a few games go down, because their developers thought, the had to listen to the loud crowd, and after some protests and changes due to these protests, that games were so much changed away from what the main audience (that did not even bother to enter a forum discussion) wanted, that the player numbers went down dramatically. 
---
One example if this effect was Age of Empires Online, where the PvP and the "this game is too easy" Speedrun-Players where the loudest crowd, and the devs changed almost everything like this group demanded. They made super-elite enemies, KI changes so the KI could also do speedruns, etc, etc. A few weeks after that patch came out, the game was almost empty and a few month later the game was turned off.
---
Yes, and can we make it so camps at Charleston Station don't stop the stop the special vendor from coming also. Kay thanks.
---
Welcome home
---
the game is objectively not good and Bethesda is making questionable choices. you're gonna have to deal with people pointing that out.
---
I dont know how many people suggested this now without reading any of the other comments, so I will just copy one of my answers: 17% of Skyrim players never finished Helgen. 20% of Doom players never finished the first level. 15% of Nier Automata players basically never started the story mode. 
---
FO76s 12% of players not leaving the vault is totally in line with similar achievements in other games. It seems not enough active players didnt earn the achievement to skew the stats in any negative way.
---
I didn't even notice. Seems like a non-issue.
---
&gt;Criticism and reviews are not allowed because I don't like reading them REEEE
---
Ah, sorry, my bad. I misunderstood your post. 
---
I take back the tone of what I said but will leave it up just for the sake of context. My sincerest apologies.
---
how do you skywalk? 
---
Perk cards are your friend.
---
They'd need to rework some pretty big engine stuff as atm you can just go into any interior cell and be safe, even if it's not a Vault or shelter.
---
No need to apologise, friendo. But thank you for the acknowledgment 
---
Turn on simple pipboy it loads much faster
---
Sounds like it failed to authenticate to me. 
---
ill try this and see if its better, cheers
---
I have seen them open once after a nuke dropped, all the scanners were smashed and the doors open, it was just after the beta and pretty sure it was a big. There was nothing interesting in there 
---
True, everytime before join a game i check there for some cheap items to buy
---
guild wars 2, blade and soul, black desert online, to name a few that have "hotfixes"
---
I don't mind all that much cause a lot is deserved. I just can't fucking stand anyone who hasn't actually played it pretend like they know what it's all about. 
---
See, I can understand that. But most people in the sub complain about the bugs and Bobby pin weights..I agree that this fallout lacks a certain depth that the others had. But it’s also just a different game.
---
I can understand what you’re saying though.
---
I’ve just not seen many posts at all about actual content, rather just people complaining about glitches
---
They do collect your in game data. You do know that right?
---
Literally LOLed
---
I wish I could upvote this more than once. 
---
Have you tried turning it off and on?
---
More often then not, I just see people screaming "GaMe BaD bEtHeSdA eViL". When actual criticism comes up, I'm happy to read it. When people try to force their opinion of the game down my throat, that's what I don't like. 
---
I'm a level 73 with a silenced lever action rifle and I can kill a level 85 scorchbeast with 10 to 15 bullets to the head. Maybe aim better?
---
They are testing the hypothesis, "All press is good press."
---
Both sides are doing pretty damn good at that so far. You have the people in the left screaming "GaMe BaD bEtHeSdA eViL" and the people on the right saying "GaMe GoOd, BeThEsDa FiX"
---
evry time i go to a vendor now they always have the same plans as last time i went there..no randomization..which sux..i used to look forward to seeing what plans a vendor may have..now i know they are always going to be the same plans...sad.. also the vendor in whitesprings who sold the cooking recipes..now doesnt sell them anymore..well when i went there he had none..:(
---
Without fail, someone always posts the "you are the minority:" diatribe you just did.
---
They usually don't take a novel to do it though
---
Melee is not OP you just suck as a ranged player its called perception agility luck build.
---
You literally play exactly like me! I do all the same things. I only fast travel if I’m in a time crunch and have to get off the game soon
---
m'kay how 'bout [Fallout being given away with used controllers](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-gamestop-germany)... that give you some idea as to this game's popularity?
---
Did we just become best friends?!  (I like this damn post...a lot!)
---
Majority of player dont even know about Reddit existence nor what is that Twitch thing, especially if they're above 30 old.
---
Well said! I keep enjoying it and when time comes, it‘s not enjoyable anymore, there will be some other things to do. I am 99% shure about that :)
---
See u in Appalachia, buddy!
---
Yeah, but later. The game hasn't even been out for 3 months, dude.
---
&gt; Why are you implying that the original poster is threatened? 
---
Umm... because it appears that way...? 
---
Look at it this way - who makes a post about over-represenation of women in a video game? It's certainly not confident men.
---
See the OP *might* have a case (I'm being generous even saying that) IF all these main female characters we're all male bashing and talking about how terrible the patriarchy is and that women are the best leaders etc.
---
It's not that at all. It's just the gender of these characters. That's it. That's all it took for it to be enough of an issue for the OP (and you it seems if you agree) that this is a PC problem.
---
That's pretty sad if that's the case.
---
I'm male and what the OP pointed out doesn't bother me in the slightest. I didn't even notice it could even be an issue until this post.
---
Not surprising in the least. 
---
teach me pls
---
You do know where the "Trash Can of Happiness" (TM) is correct?
---
Read the terminals on the whitesprings bunker and talk to Modus on the command center, it does explain the liberators and you get a lead on where they are coming from.
---
You understand that they don’t keep all the physical cash there, right?
---
u/Hopscotch873 is it okay to call this guy a douche for his post? Just checking.
---
If your not an OP Melee build then you must really suck lmao 
---
&gt;"GaMe GoOd, BeThEsDa FiX"
---
I feel like I'm in that camp, but I do get a a little unstable sometimes.
---
For reals so many people bitch about it lol. If I don’t like a game I move on and play something else, not cry to everyone how bad it is because that won’t do anything lol.
---
Move on people, it’s pretty easy
---
If this is not an error it paves the way for a massive nerf to unarmed though...
---
Currently unarmed while still OP is balanced by the risk of being without PA. If they give you the PA then...
---
The disease that makes you take 50% more rads is still making you take 50% more positive and negative effects from all your mutations. Which means speed demon is a bigger drain on resources (especially without class freak). 
---
I am putting some videos together to try to upload this weekend of my melee and ranged characters and how they are OP in their own ways 
---
Can you see total play hours? I'd be interested to see which ones highest. 
---
I feel the same way. When a bug vests you a ton of time lost its crushing for a moment.  It happens far too often. Still a fun game so I hope they get their shit together.
---
I respect you for sticking your neck out like this even when you know that your gonna get crap for it. And I gotta say this post opened my eyes on alot of things and you pointed out a few things i havent even tought of. 
---
Even though i consider my self a more causual gamer apperantly i am more of a try hard player since i'm lvl 220 and i have 500 hours in the game. But still i dont mind the recent nerfing of the TSE because in tge long term its never fun to be a god who one shot every enemy. Its more fun to go toe to toe with a super mutant.
---
It is so refreshing to see a post here by an adult.  Thank you.
---
That would be a no dawg.
---
Maybe just an under armor variant/mod for less than full 1000, but the ability to wear armor?
---
Fallout 76 is absolutely horrible. Bat heads should be ashamed, my life is essentially ruined by this. 
---
Good old fashioned faceroll.
---
Man. No one has done this yet? Do I really have to do it. Okay I'll do it. I bet as soon as I post there will be three other posts with the same thing one minute before.
---
So is the "The nerf happened because melee people were butthurt from losing in PvP"
---
Like, the fuck?
---
&gt;  What happens is that when I log in, my character remembers the weapon he was holding when I logged out, but not the "hotswap" weapon and not the throwable (you know, grenades or throwing weapons). 
---
Ah, ok, that really does look like a regression.  AFAIR it didn't happen to me last night, before or after the hotfix.  Odd.
---
I don't know if Im mistaken or if it is buggy but disease duration is weird for me. Sometimes I would see that it has 1 minute left and after quitting and coming back into the game, the duration increases to 3 hrs+
---
Did you ever have that friend that changed the rules of a game mid game to suit them? This is like that. 
---
Then please realize you just ruined twoshot/explosive weapons and lost hundreds of players. Im totally okay with a nerf, but not with making weapons, on which a lot of players farmed for weeks, completely useless. Just rollback with this screwed up patch and nerf the tse for about 50%. thanks
---
I completely agree with everything you have said. Bravo!
---
1. Rad Worms affecting mutations/consumable. Acknowledged by the CM before the hot fix.
---
2. "Caution" mode even without mobs around you. Acknowlegdged by the CM before the hot fix.
---
3. Favorites not saving. Acknowledged by the CM before the hot fix.
---
4. Enemies denying damage. 
---
5. Power armor stations being placed on the higher floor.
---
6. Disappearing items. Acknowledged by the CM before the hot fix.
---
7. Price scroll dont warp at 0. Acknowledged by the CM before the hot fix.
---
And it keeps on going.
---
When they made a post about this hotfix, lots of players comented that more bugs were actually breaking the game, but they stick to those 3. The least importante of the list.
---
If you want to check it by yourself:

---
Yep! It's the same issue that most people do not have an idea of the "big picture", period. Not just this game, or games, but in general. Most people can't see past the nose on their face.
---
More nerfs are inbound, or they'll lighten the TSE nerf, or &lt;insert less probable, but still possible Bethesda response here&gt;.
---
THOU HAS LOST AN EIGHTH!
---
There will be people in the offices that we can take the money from. 
---
True.  But that's like... Mexican Space Agency sloppy.
---
"omfg in done! people hating the haters for hating the game that the lovers love cos todd said its good!"
---
Get off reddit and get back to work, Todd doesnt pay you to sit around crying about not being loved on reddit.
---
He pays you to make bobby pins weigh more than cars!
---
Where in the OP did they say trey were bothered by it? They raised a point, and in my opinion, an interesting one.
---
If anyone is offended, bothered or threatened, it seems to be you...
---
It’s a sad state of affairs when people can’t respond civilly and rationally to a civil question... 
---
Not steel. The only items that save weight by bulking are lead and aluminum. The only reason to bulk anything else is if you are about to sell it.
---
It's been there since beta
---
I guess, but it's different people deciding to write those posts. Maybe there could be a single thread where people can "me too", if they have nothing more to add.
---
Sick. I get home from school at 3
---
Good is all relative. Plans and the occasional levelled rare weapon were about it.
---
Treasure maps in my eyes are a very early to mid game sort of thing. I only do it nowadays just on the off-chance I pick up I plan I don't have or extra rare weapon to scrap for a chance to learn a new mod. That's it.
---
Yes, engaged in pvp. He came to my camo, hit my mate a couple of times. I then hit back, to which there was literally no damage to him, once fighting. So output damage is halved in regards to damage resistance? Is there any vids or explanations anywhere that tell us the ins and outs of damage etc?
---
Yeah but if you do finish it first think of all those reddit points you'll get.
---
That do happen for me when you kill an foe while the mobs in the area are respawning.
---
If you have a water purifiers at your camp or in public workshops, they stack in your queue. 
---
Just an FYI 
---
same here. and im on the water near harpers ferry
---
😂 absolutely 
---
Yes, it does matter.
---
Also - I saw all of the excavator mods on Chad (the Responder bot) in Camden Park last night.  Those prices.. holy shit - but everything was there.  Thus far, that's the only bot I've seen those on.
---
Let me get this straight; you witnessed the beta and it was bad. You Witnessed the released game and it was still bad. You probably played the game at this point and it was still not good. Now you're shocked this happened? =) What happened to not buying bad things.
---
I hope to the great spaghetti monster in the sky that you’re on a list somewhere. 
---
kay... Cool Story Bro!.... and your point is......?
---
You will continue to see these threads for as long as you keep clicking on them... are you missing something here?
---
Anything different? Any developments? Or are you just commenting for the sake of commenting? :P
---
You are complaining to complain. How else would they fix the problems? Every other online game shuts down for a few minutes to an hour with a hotfix.
---
&gt; Melee is not OP 
---
&gt;they are OP in their own ways
---
k
---
The items aren't pay to win. It's the event that even gives them the bonus IF you meet some very specific conditions to get a very modest boost. 
---
You know this bonus stops like in a few days, right?
---
Honestly due to random disconnects of teammates (often midcombat when mutations are most beneficial), I’ve found it’s better to just go back to it using strange in numbers at all. It’s not quite as good but if you’re like me trying to get more damage out of the adrenal reaction mutation, my advice is consider swapping to rank 1 Tenderizer perk. Like I said, it’s not as good but it’s something, and it doesn’t break with/without teammates.
---
My melee build is way OP now compared to my sniper build .... my sniper build can one hit most things with its power fist....which it can’t do with riffle. Melee is way OP. Don’t bother saying I don’t know how to make builds....been making builds since your where wearing diapers lmao 
---
It's almost like it's bugged.. would you imagine that?
---
Glad you saw the humour in it mate.
---
His response to me is a little concerning. 
---
Who?
---
People going to go balls deep on Bethesda and this shit show when those modders make a perfect working mmo out of skyrim but yet all the financial might and blind fanboism of Bethesda could only come up with this!
---
And the fact most junk is heavier bulked
---
Blueprints should put them back the way they were.
---
Just store items first then move camp.
---
Do you know of any similar trick for Grahm?
---
Need those radiation emitter plans..
---
I have always been intrigued by this also. I assume IcyPuffin is right and it is for future content (to be released in 2021 when all bugs are fixed).
---
I honestly just don't get all the complaints.  I have over a hundred hours in the game and it's better than most games I've played.  Maybe because I've played games for the last 30 years I'm used to playing 'shit' games?  I dunno - I love 76 and every patch has brought improvements that I've enjoyed.
---
So do I win the fashion contest?
---
https://imgur.com/a/UOSXUWq
---
Got my silver shroud outfit with pirate hat ..... gasp! I used atoms to pay for that too.
---
I gotta win now.
---
It’s OP and you know it ..... lmao 
---
How old are you? Didn't pre-school teach you English?
---
I read a lot of griefers on console, even though I’m on pc.
---
As for patches, I think pc gets them 1st.
---
&gt;and you are just trying to ruin their fun.
---
There's "fun?"
---
Not quite as dumb as your comment though.
---
lol it's actually quite rewarding when you get a good loot from her but the problem is she drops shit loot like 99% of the time. Killed the queen countless times and so far I think I got 3 ok loots but that's about it
---
How the hell can people ruin an already ruined game? Fo76 is just bad, there is literally no way around that
---
You can actually somewhat infer how big a player base is from how many is posting/reading on a forum.
---
[Ask a game dev - 80, 20, 5](http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/149466049419/80-20-5)
---
It's an interesting read, but the overall conclusion is that only about 5% of a player base actually takes the time to post or subscribe.
---
I can see them without clicking on them dingus. You asked if anyone was talking about it and I said yeah non fucking stop. Developments? Seems like you're the one missing something if you haven't noticed the dozens of shit posts like yours being posted regularly.
---
&gt; Approx. 100 plastic gone.
---
That's a lot of plastic.  What a bummer.
---
&gt;How did people become so entitled and serious over a game?
---
So did your parents never teach you the value of a dollar? If someone took $60/$50/$40 our of your wallet and burned it in front of you would you thank them for the cool fire and experience or would you be pissed? Would you be shocked and astonished if they then turned round and said 'Jesus man, stop being so entitled, at least I had some fun.'
---
Video gaming is probably the only industry where players can expect a reasonable standard of quality and be ridiculed for it by people who have quality standards stored in Jimmy Hoffa's back pocket.
---
I assume at least it's the same or similar to Fallout 4.
---
You know if people are really geared up for pvp and have all defense abilities it is going to be like that. Now if the person is using Dodgy you need to hit them a bunch of times to deplete their AP. Fast firing weapons will do that fast. If they are using sentinel armor that makes them t ake -75% damage when standing still, you need to stagger them. You can do that with different weapons and perk cards. I would also advise maybe a Radium rifle also as it does radiation damage.
---
You mean.. just the frame, right?
---
I would say even bordering on criminal - are they actually suggesting / encouraging robbery? 
---
That is the right question. Beth should restrict the building zone next to the club.
---
I like the music genre but yeah they could update it abit. I’m sure it’s all public domain now
---
&gt;opinion 
---
Modders have been tracking bugs and pointing out how to fix them since day one. Bethesda doesn't want their help. So here we are, bugs that were found during the B.E.T.A. aren't fixed. New bugs crop up, old bugs come back.
---
And anything they "balance" means its been nerfed.
---
The game is not fun.
---
She tends not to die anyway, last 5 fights for me she was still at quarter health as it timed out....
---
Yeah melee can be tuned down a bit.
---
My complaint is that we ARE the beta testers. I didn't pay to play a game that is still in beta. The sheer amount if issues they have fixed up to this point is painfully obvious. I still love the game, but come on this is ridiculous. 
---
If you're still playing this shit show you deserve what ever they do
---
Of course. But, hey, there are new outfits in the Atom Store!
---
happens every time I enter my power armor or fast travel whiles wearing the power armor.
---
There's one available in game free. 
---
Sounds balanced.
---
I saw that very same thing last night.  Doing what you suggested reset everything back to normal for me.
---
&gt; you people are all toxic as fuck the last few days.
---
What could have changed in the last few days? Has the (previously friendly) userbase suddenly and conspiratorially been replaced by a bunch of complainers. Or has Bethesda done something to sour the users?
---
We should just stop being worried . This game wont see its 1 year anniversary if it continues like this.  I play and not leaving yet. But when i find a new game i wont think twice about leaving. It was same with destiny for me. Just playing intil i find a new rpg mmo whatever you want call them.Lets be honest , many games have issues at release but its been 3 months and when they patch this they roll back lol. 
---
What happens in next patch if they roll back all duping methods? And nobody can say for sure that wont happen. Its sad cause i like this game, even more if it would work properly and they would not try to make game "longer" without dlc by forcing ppl to grind even more due to all nerfs thats been and are to come.
---
Luckily I'm melee, so nothing but a bit of wood was used...
---
There were a lot of people out there, and we had steady firepower. She only had about 1/4 life left, and we were pouring it on. Really too bad. Lots of people wasted a lot of time and ammo.
---
I'm pretty sure I still play this game because I hate myself.
---
&gt; Where in the OP did they say trey were bothered by it? 
---
Let's see...
---
&gt;Is it now 'offensive' to have just one strong male character?    
---
&gt;Good try at equality Bethesda but you went a bit overboard 
---
No, you're right. Any reasonable person would say "Bethesda going overly pc?" and finish with the above just as quaint observation, right? You know, as a point of discussion, right?
---
It's like asking the question "How often do you rape your partner?" and claiming that you're just looking to have a discussion. 
---
I get that this example is hyperbolic but it's to illustrate that this post isn't just a civil conversation or just an open discussion, so let's not insult each other's intelligences and pretend it is.
---
If you're a loyal Fallout fanboy then you will know that 
---
&gt;Once upon the time (before DLC, before micro transactions, before day-0 patches or Early Access Alpha testing) good games have been released with proper testing and everything.
---
has never been true for Bethesda. This isn't a Nintendo-esque company that has lost its way.
---
We are all fools!
---
No one mentioned Grahm! 
---
"Hush Moo Moo! You hear that? Trades! Trades in the wind."

It’s not just a game. It’s a beloved series that I’ve spent countless hours playing since the original turn based from mid nineties. I’ve enjoyed all of them to varying degrees and how the wasteland has evolved over the years and through different companies visions for it. What Besthesda Austin is doing to a version of it that I personally dreamt about for many years is unconscionable. So who the fuck are you OP to tell me how to react and feel. 
---
I think the root of the problem is that they released the game in essentially the beta. Im angry that I paid for a AAA game that's still in the testing phase. 
---
Lol. We've, actually you've, already established you know far too little about the situation to make informed comments. Its the level of complicit ignorance / arrogance, the "I'm fine and I don't think it's a big deal, so it ain't" that hurts gamers as a whole. I get that this is all way over your head, and that's why there are some people on here that do understand the wider ramifications of the way this shit show has been handled, the contempt consumers are being shown and are voicing their concerns. Dude, totally have no issue with you enjoying the game, and more power to you, but don't get involved in a conversation that you simply aren't equipped for.
---
I bought this game for my son at Christmas. He played until level 15, got bored and hasn't played since.

Now he's playing New Vegas, again.

I’m on pc and First starting out,  I started collecting random PA pieces to assemble a full set.  While the random t45/t51/t60, in stash, random PA pieces would overwrite others, so that I had multiple helmets legs and arms of 1, but not the missing parts I needed Lolz
---
I submitted a ticket for it but ended up completing miner miracles so I could make 1 complete excavator PA.
---
7, 23, 28, 34, 41 and a bonus ball off 9
---
You've lost the plot entirely...
---
No, if they tripled the blast radius you could spend 5 minutes just running into the damn zone. It'd end up being a giant pain in the ass that everyone would end up calling a hassle after the novelty and excitement wore off. If the zone size stayed the same then this would be fine... but everyone knows whats going to get nuked anyway. White spring, SBQ and rarely Morgantown. At first people would nuke other spots for the novelty of making people nervous but after the first week we'd be right back to the other 3.
---
It always has done I think
---
Yeah i think a lot faster.
---
Report him
---
Held accountable for what? In all the interviews we were told exactly what this game was and so far they haven't been wrong. There are bugs and problems but they told us that would be the case. If you got 500 hours on a game that has only been put for a little under 3 months I call that money well spent.
---
Imagine the shit storm if it was a temp 25% increase in explosive damage!
---
&gt; The issues this game faces continue to diminish in quantity and magnitude, and I think that has been underacknowleged.
---
This is a monumentally generous overstatement.
---
Imagine you buy a lump of coal and decide you're going to turn it into a diamond, so you put a brick on top of it. The next day you go to check, nope still coal. So you put another brick on top of it. Congratulations, you're now closer to your diamond. The issue of it still being coal has diminished. You repeat this process X times, each time you are getting closer to that diamond. But are you really?
---
In Whitesprings a melee character with only a hazmat suit on was able to kill me with my 3 star pump action shot gun (not ts or e) with 1 hit while I had power armor on with a deathclaw gauntlet. Meanwhile I crit him with a blast and shot several more times at him before he reached and one shot me. Say what you want about my possibly shitty aim (I was using VATS anyway) but one swipe while im PA? Why should a claw do more damage than a shotgun? Its stupid.
---
After 200 rounds my 100% repaired TSE broke and I was magically teleported towards the enemy.
---
What is going on with you Bethesda?
---
Appreciate it anyways tho ♡
---
Mine still works. Love the recon scopes 
---
I’m on pc
---
What is going on with you, Bethesda?
---
I will buy them if you are in ps4 :) 
---
Lolz no internet 
---
Dysentery is a bitch.
---
Are you trying to say you can't move the physical little c.a.m.p object can't be placed indoors? 
---
Or are you asking for when picking a new location can you just instantly put all the objects back in place? If the latter.. No you gotta use blueprints
---
Nah that´s not it either. It´s more hearing the same lame jokes and memes about it every time on the internet. That has been done way better already decades ago, by Monty Python for example.
---
This game is like going to the restaurant and paying 60$ knowibg you are going to be sick after eating. 
---
OP, would you still be willing to help out with this for mats?
---
Then you return it and ask for a refund. Not discuss every inch of "shit" and how to improve it. OP is making the case that this community become a circle jerk of negativity and not even decent criticism.
---
If you were served shit, then why did you spend over 100 hours staring at it. 
---
if this is their best i'd like to see their worst
---
At this point I think its fair to be frustrated with Bethesda, the game, the amount of bugs/glitches, and of course the lack of content.  You're kinda just nitpicking about semantics at this point.  I didn't come here to tell you that your interpretation of "hotfix" is wrong, I think enough people did that already.  I'm just saying that actual criticism should be on target to actual issues.  We should do our best to be constructive when we complain about this game, if we want it to actually get better.  
---
My take on the whole thing is this is a fun game.   Sure it gets boring sometimes. Sure it has bugs. Sure it has griefers.   I got 250+ hours of of the fun into the game and that $60 was a deal for me.   Any game I can get 60+ hours for $60 is fine with me.   Some games are great but only get 40 hours and that's it, so I chalk those up as a loss.
---
$1 per hour is a fantastic ratio for entertainment. 
---
There are games that you play because you own them and they are enjoyable.  There are games that you look forward to playing.  This was one of those Look-forward-to-playing games for me.
---
I see this comment every time the pay2win is mentioned.  
---
# YOU CANNOT WEAR ANY ARMOR WITH THE GODDAMN GARB OF MYSTERIES.
---
You can however purchase the silver shroud outfit and then equip your OP sentinel armor.
---
Melee very OP, balistic weapons balanced, laser weapons extremely underpowered.
---
Also Im not built for melee at all, and I still use a melee weapon as a backup when my gun breaks because it does just as much damage. 
---
You can sell anything to a vendor that they want..
---
How about you revisit this statement once pvp leaderboards out, huh?
---
Yes, many challenges are impossible to complete. BGS know about it, but don't give a f..., they prefer that you won't get atom points for completing challenges and buy them for real money from the shop...
---
Someone may have already stated this but just to make sure YOU understand. YOU AND THIS SUBREDDIT ARE NOT THE "VAST MAJORITY" 
---
You would be welcome to swap them for something as Im at max caps, but PC I am afraid... not an elitist one I might add, I have PS4 Pro and XboxOneX, but it was real cheap on PC like £10 (now about 7).
---
Playing with yourself again?
---
Close the door this time.
---
If you watch the interviews they told you EXACTLY what we were getting. They said it'd be clunky at first. They said there would be updates to make it less clunky. They have not lied or deviated from what they told us.
---
Didn’t you know that an axe is more dangerous than a high tech energy weapon that’s the size of a small cannon and needs repairs constantly cause it’s so so op lmao .... Maree needs serious nerf yes 
---
&gt; 600 hours of fallout 76 gameplay gets boring. 
---
600 hours of gameplay is playing this game 8 hours every single day since launch without a break on any day. If anyone has played that much ... I can't even imagine.
---
How so?
---
I don't post much.  Most of what I'm thinking has been said by someone else.  My first post here was removed, because bots I guess.  I see what you're saying.  But, this vocal minority has had some influence obviously.  Otherwise the TSE weapons wouldn't have been nerfed.  I still play.  I still enjoy much of the game.  There seem to be a lot of old bugs, that are back.  I've been under my carry weight, and the game tells me I've over and I can't fast travel.  Today, the opposite.  I'm about 50 over and I can fast travel.  I got to be in a SBQ battle last night.  I'm in the middle of the nuked area, and I am taking zero radiation.  I'm hit with the SBQ attack, and my HP goes up, not down.  At one point, I'm trying to repair stuff, and I can't.  Bulk items don't show up when I'm trying  to scrap.  I see them in my inventory, but they don't show up in the scrap menu.  Even though bulked items can be used again, that shouldn't happen.  I have crashed since the patch.  Something went really wrong with this last patch.  It's the bugs that are bothering me, not the balance issues.  I would rather have them test the patch out for another week, before making it live.
---
It is definitely draining food and water faster.  I am server hopping Grafton Monsters for acid and oil and have to stop and eat/drink after 2-3 hops.  Normally it is like 5-6
---
I saw that on PC too.  Grrrrrrr.  Is there QA department even doing any work?
---
You really should sit down 
---
Luck does not affect the traits or number of stars on a legendary. Only the condition of the weapon you found
---
yeah, I don't thing that's the reason... You can complain about something without bringing up conspiracy theories.
---
It is, and I'm gonna come out with the I told you so once lunchboxes are rolled out.  Sorry you're being downvoted for pointing out the obvious. 
---
You bulk items to manage storage space, stash or yours.  you sell bulk items because it’s easier to manage large bulk rather loose screws, springs, copper..
---
I agree. Go outside.
---
Too little about the situation?   lol
---
I enjoy playing the game. What else do I need to know? 
---
Past experience in game development? Being a mod developer for a decade? Knowing the internals of Gamebryo and Papyrus? 
---
All I need to know is that the game sparks joy. 
---
Everything else is pointless negativity.
---
And my point was that no-one's asking you to read 'em genius :D
---
They never lied though? Seriously, go watch the interviews. They never lied and told you what 76 would be. 
---
lulz
---
I agree. For the love of god bring some damage back to ranged! Because if they nerf melee like they have ranged there will literally be no weapons worth a damn. The game won’t be fun at all anymore at that point. So yes, I agree they need to do some rebalancing on the gun damage because they killed all guns completely unless you have a two shot and those are really rare if your a legitimate player that didn’t go searching for a duped one
---
Even the dude who releases community patch notes said he could see this bug coming from reading the changes in the code.
---
I watched your Fallout 4 videos &amp; picked up some tips from those at the time. Happy to see you are still at it and sharing your wisdom with the rest of us. This is the best build I've seen in Fallout76, really well done! 
---
Tbh the sub is probably half the people that play it 
---
Or..
---
You could enable pacifist and watch what you hit.
---
If they can't get something as simple as this to work then what hope does this game have long term?
---
You give the banks to much credit, they don't care how long you tried and tried with  broken product. They ask if it was fit for purpose, if you answer NO you get your charge back done no questions asked. Least here in the UK.
---
They also don't care or take into account things like "awwww but the dev's worked hard and really tried"
---
If people feel they deserve or just want a refund they are within there rights to charge back as the law states. it really is that simple. 
---
&gt; Held accountable for what?
---
Incompetent development and release practices? I'm pretty sure in the interviews no one every said 'The team has no idea what it's doing'.
---
Then why go to that restaurant? 
---
How do people build stuff like this? 
---
My budget is max'd at a small wooden shack at level 125
---
of course it's not the real reason - they are just really poor developers, who released untested game full of bugs and glitches, where not working challenges are one of the least annoying problems.
---
Yep perk loadout manager has vastly improved my game experience. Kudos to Keretus, Bethesda should employ him to work on patches. 
---
I see.  Well thank you for the explanation.
---
I just noticed that it had no effect on the mobs.
---
Sounds like that's the best way now. Unless you've had to turn in like hundreds of them so far.
---
It's like having a discussion with a lettuce. I understand that you don't get it. It's not your fault. I hope the game continues to spark joy.
---
right but again this isn't aimed to appease the try hard 200s this is just a suggested solution to allow it to still be utilized for the casual average joe that just wants to walk around with a combat rifle without feeling like hes shin-kicking a t-rex because the moleminer is 5 levels higher than himself.  the high level players already one hit a lot of enemies.   there's several min-max builds.  this is just to allow the average player to enjoy a bit more balanced gameplay because bethesda kinda screwed the pooch on enemy health.  and i know its not always the case and i know it should have an element of ''challenge'' but it gets a bit obnoxious  given the compounding glitches and engine limitations like gun handling and enemies clipping and crowd-spawning 
---
The weekly challenges are most often bugged for me but the dailies usually work. 
---
Signing in again fixes it for me. I always get random errors when first logging in. I dont bother and just retry and it works. 
---
just don`t come here anymore ... it`s the best solution trust me - reddit is just an echochamber for literally everyting. 
---
If you are served shit do you you just stand up and walk out or do you leave reviews that the restaurant served you a plate of shit? Do you want someone else to walk into that restaurant expecting a good meal only to also be presented with a plate of shit?
---
The biggest source of anger/frustration with this patch isn't any of the things they messed up and already hotfixed but the working-as-intended TSE nerf.   Lots of "people role playing as traders" with a pile of duplicated weapons that are no longer OP and lots of people who spent caps (or worse real money) on a weapon that is no longer OP.  
---
You’re asking for a vendor punch list?
---
It’s on google. Just hit the wiki..
---
&gt; After 600+ hours of fun
---
I'm not saying that no one has 600 hours of gameplay... but lets take a second to do some math right? 79(number of days since release)*8 hours a day = 632 hours. Are you really going to sit there and claim that there is a reasonable number of people who have 600 hours of game play? I doubt that number is above the low triple digits out of the hundreds of thousands of players. I've put a **lot** of time into the game at 202 hours. Almost **all** of my free time until recently. Practically no one has 8 hours a day to sit and play a video game unless it's their job, and even then those people aren't playing FO76.
---
I'll get my straw....
---
pull out your weapon instead of pipbpy; if your weapon shows up you are safe; if it is just your bare hands or a disassembled mesh then you haven’t fully loaded yet 
---
Need to head there soon 
---
For canned coffee, equip the 'Can do' perk.  Then head to the Whitesprings.  Every bin you see is a food container, search every bin around the golf club, outside the main building and inside.  
---
You will yield a lot of canned coffee by doing this.
---
noooo... modders are around for the best and worst games... it's not just BSW fans who make amazing mods such as this...
---
And if you really dig deep; some of the best mods come from the glory days when TES and FO weren't BSW IPs.
---
Bethesda IS however the only company (that I know of) that has actively tried to market and sell mods, not created by them, thus resulting in the forced abortion we now call the "creation club"
---
Your prolly screwed than. My buddy hasn’t been able to have a camp for 3 updates now because of the same reason. His camp is overbudget after moving his camp and there isn’t anything in his stored. So even 2 1/2 months later. Still no fix for him unless he logins in with a different character 
---
Yeah I see it a lot.
---
The workaround is logging off and close the app.
---
Didn’t realise there where than many options lmao 
---
The launcher update actually broke the link to my game from the launcher. 
---
Had to re download the game even though it was still on my drive. 
---
Launching the game via the exe wouldn't let me log in :(
---
Dupers getting banned..lolz
---
First off it's an improvement over fallout 4 in these ways: There is no voiced protagonist and the leveling system is more fun and creates more unique characters.  Also the crafting system is vastly improved - there is no long a 'best' mod and all of the mods have advantages and disadvantages and fit better with different builds.
---
The envioronments look fantastic - Each area is very distinct from the others while also having a good amount of distinction within them.
---
The enemies are great - at the very least they look fantastic - they have a variety of different ways of reacting to the player.  (scorched staying camoflauged and then rushing in - super mutant waves being triggered by mutant houd howls, etc.
---
More guns!  The game has more guns than fallout 4 and three and with the exception of the crossbow (Which i hope gets some more love - and i have no reason to believe it wont eventually) have been more than fun to play with.  Also with the mods have pretty balanced effects it creates an even greater variety.
---
"Building as Motivation" - I love building and crafting, and claiming workshops to earn workshop schematics, powering up plants to get generator plans, and scouring shops (now I guess saving up my meat money for more plans) has been very rewarding for me.  I love coming back to my little compound in the mire after a long walkabout across Apalachia - hunting and super duping cooked meat to sell to vendors.
---
Ooo!  Other great things!  Wood armor!  I love wood armor - for two reasons - great for stealth builds.  They vastly improved the lever action a few patches ago and its even more fun now.
---
I have had a lot of playing through the plot and interacting with the characters as well - Graham with his acid zen metal poetry, the robots with their sexy voices, and Abbie with her sweetness and creepy brain - the other hologhosts were pretty good too - are all a blast to interact with!
---
Photomode!  I've been having so much fun with photo mode.  The different filters - the amount of control you have - the game is so customizable you can even make your own loading screens - neat!
---
Multiplayer - I have run into three 'griefers' over the course of over a hundred hours of play.  I have just run away into the woods and hidden - my endurance and agility are higher than theirs usually and I have chameleon armor.  A person started attacking my base once and I just logged out.
---
For the most parth though I have had alot of fun with multiplayer - I have one buddy I play with a lot and I met a couple new guys (and their moms, and sisters, and pets) who I have been having a blast with.
---
Another big improvement is how HP works - in most modern fallout games your HP and enemy HP stacks forever as you level - now it just doesn't which is great - least bullet spongey enemies I've ever seen in high level play modern fallout.  With the obvious exception of Scorchbeasts - but with a group Scorchbeasts are alot of fun - one person takes out the scorched wave - one person shoots out the wings - and one person bashes its skull in!  Or one person with a high DR build kits it while the luck build keeps shooting it in the head - fun!
---
TLDR: I ordered waffles and I got waffles with free whip cream and strawberries on top.

Only thing that affected me: bobby pin weight. 
---
when you start getting email at [myaddress+somegame@gmail.com](mailto:myaddress+somegame@gmail.com) and its not from somegame you know who sold your email address. 
---
Interesting theory, something I'll give a shot
---
Ya I simply don't understand why this game is the hill OP's chosen to die on. Of all the awful greedy, low effort games to come out this is the one he's decided to vehemently defend. And Bethesda clearly doesn't give a shit about its players much less one like him defending them. Kinda sad.
---
they actually have fish and fish on a stick images in the game they sit on bbq's and such so it seems like turning those into items wouldn't be to difficult as a first step to making a larger system then they could add a "net" base object that catches us fish and then finally fishing giving us more ways for food near water as well as more things to do 
---
Don’t subject to that stuff my friend. Just hang it up for a few months and find something good to play. 
---

---
The sub has become awash with irrationally angry people - I can see a lot of people down voting anything positive out of anger - could be wrong
---
I could list a hundred reasons why you're wrong, starting with the last disastrous patch and going all the way back to nukes crashing the queen- which they still do.
---
pure, simple, unquestionable incompetence at this point. I was never told amateurs would be making this game. issues that modders would fix in an afternoon remain unpatched months later.
---
my favorite is "we couldn't fix explosive energy projectiles, so we removed the weapons altogether lol"
---
Usually there’s a canned coffee in the silos, When u enter the silo, head to the room where the terminals and id card readers are. When ur standing in front of the terminals, look to the left. There‘s a shelf with a coffee on it.
---
Right, so *in context* the quote I originally gave and directed my comment *about* wasn't the damage balance, and removing explosive from the weapons mentioned wasn't about damage. It's two separate things. And given how they ended the quote with basically "and we'll see what shakes out" it definitely wasn't a bug fix.
---
Could you go over your complaints for me?
---
Exactly, take a break and find another game to fill the void.  It's no use wasting time and energy on a game that barely works.
---
This explains some problems I was having with piece interactions in my build. Well done sir. Thank you. 
---
I heard, man! Unfortunately its also my wife's birthday this weekend. Just going to have to miss this weekend. Will be watching what everyone says about the game.... so play a lot for me, brother.
---
Well for starters if you're over level 50 and still using power armor that is part of your problem. Second if you're using VATS to aim and dont have the *perception* to back it up then you're going to miss more times than not. Also just because you have a T3 shotgun doesn't mean it is any good. If you are going to run a shotgun build your main focus is to cripple your enemies. Should have shot dude in the legs then you could have easily kited him hell if you just shot him in his right arm and crippled it he wouldnt be able to use heavy attacks and normal attacks would be slower unless he was running adamantium skeleton or had modded armor to reduce limb damage.  Also if he was wearing a hazmat suit that means at best he had 100-150 ballistic resistance. But to say melee is too OP? Don't make me laugh. I am 100% positive they have already tweaked melee damage in the recent needs because things that I could 1 shot before the patches now take 3-7 hits depending on if my crit procs.
---
That's an exceptional circumstance by the sounds of things. 
---
I _do_ get it; I get that it’s just a game and not worth engendering any negative emotions.
---
Class freak (3*) at all times, the str/end/agi loss is unbearable w/o it
---
i now must carry 40 corn soups instead of 25 + eat and drink what i find traveling around, so yes there is a noticeable difference.  
---
It always happens in the WSB for me; I just chalk it up to MODUS being a dick and go on with my day.
---
I just wait until a few seconds after the radio turns on
---
I saw a base like this I built a mortar base and chucked in around 30 smoke grenades and people kept coming to see why my wanted was so high saw what I was doing and walked away 
---
PS4 here and the sneak issues from the last patch were resolved with the hotfix. 
---
What platform you on, mate?
---
Cool down the dumb competition boyos.
---
don't remember my 10mm doing 50k damage per shot
---
Well Bethesda wouldn’t care either way they already got the money from the salty TSE users that didn’t adapt their build. 
---
I still enjoy the game in just giving it a break right now. 350 hours has taken its toll..
---
Yup, noticed it myself last night.  Having to eat and drink more often.  This is not for the better.
---
"Our QA team tested a fight against a SQB and we can assure she can still be killed" so I'm sorry but you are clearly wrong! ^^^/s
---
Everything is OP if you are good with tactics and the style you are playing but I have noticed most of the people here are clueless on how to build a character. If I didnt know any better I would swear it was their first fallout game 
---
Check your stored tab and see if you have multiples of any items, I also read that camp budget is based on level so maybe try moving and rebuilding 
---
Starting with an insult, then you mock me and then you say you're right. Man learn to make a point, you seem like a damn fool right now. I didn't spend that much time, in reality it's probably barely half that. Oh by the way, i'd like to see what you think in a couple of months. Yep defend those patches, defend bethesda, please I implore you to suck their knobs hard. Let's see where their so called 'effort to patch' this game leads. In the mean time, instead of holding on false hopes of a better game right now, the rest of us will be actually doing stuff. Now please, don't just come here to be an arse, don't get triggered by stuff that doesn't concern you, be a bit more mature thanks. 
---
Yeah like the YouTube reviewers who played to like level 10 and have a 20 minute video saying how bad it is. Like it is good in a lot of ways, but it does have problems. If you can overlook like most of us have crashes, disconnects, bugs, etc. it is a good game with a lot of cool systems.
---
yeah when i said Bethesda could only come up with this i meant this really poor attempt to turn fallout into an mmo that they call a ready to launch game.
---
Modders are good for all gamer's out there, Bethesda and the priorities they have as a company are pretty much everything that is wrong with gaming these days and of course other big companies that prioritise micro transactions and dishonest advertising / PR.
---
Profit &gt; Quality, customers, honesty the Bethesda way!
---
Can't wait to play some skyrim as a mmo, my only hope is that someone at Bethesda play's it a bit and takes note. Or even better sack the whole friken dev team and hire these modders that will show them how it's done and take half the amount of time to do that whilst there at it.
---
I've checked all that, all seems good. I even scrapped everything apart from crafting benches, shower etc. Still the same.
---
&gt;Not a fan boy
---
Might wanna rethink that after writing paragraphs to defend an objectively much lower quality entry to the series.
---
Again with the 50k comment and no link to back it up
---
There are much better games out there that you can have fun on, why keep toturing yourself on a shitty one?
---
I dunno it seems like the whole outcome of this game is so amateur for Bethesda. Broken launch, nylon bags, shitty jackets, Nuka-Alchohol. Did Bethesda learn anything over the span of a decade? Did Todd get his shirt caught on the corporate ladder?
---
I've said it before, but the vendor cap pool is my *absolute* /#1 easy, massive benefit, huge QoL (like I'd literally play so much more to gather junk etc) update right now. What's more is you really can't fuck it up! It could be in the next patch I'd be so happy
---
* If the community didn't uproar about communication, there would have been no patch notes.
---
* If the community didn't uproar about the canvas bag, they wouldn't have replaced them with the proper advertised bag.
---
* If the community didn't uproar about communication, we would never have had some CMs.
---
* If the community didn't uproar about releasing an untested broken patch, there would have been no hotfix.
---
What I have learned from Bethesda is you need to fight for an issue to be fixed time and time again.  It's frustrating to watch a game with so much potential being mismanaged.
---
I actually made my camp just outside of the typical nuke blast area for WS and built a artillery cannon for this very reason. It is very satisfying to call in a strike on this bullshit.
---
Has rad X always suppressed mutations?
---
Oh and by the way you've been with the responders for maximum 11 days. Try two months jerk. Then you'll understand where this game is going. Don't make yourself look more like a fool than you already have succeeded so well in doing so far. 
---
It is silly that you can hit a creature in the face with a Mini Nuclear bomb and they're not even bothered....
---
They are not involved in fo76 development, it is being run by a small offshoot dev group detached from the main studio. 
---
Hence the slow turnaround and poor quality patches. If they are smart about it they should inject extra workforce into fo76 for about a month and really work to fix it, not keep releasing patches that are only 50% effective and involve mostly nerfs.
---
 Imagine the shit storm if it was a temp 25% increase in explosive damage! 
---
Clunky is overstatement
---
Yes, I pre-ordered the Tricentennial version....
---
Never pre- ordering another Bethesda product ever again. In fact, after this insult to customers.... It will be hard to convince me to buy anything not created by Arkane or Machine Games ever again.
---
I have played Fallout games since Fallout 1's release day.  I worried when Bethesda acquired the IP and announced Fallout 3.... But they pulled off the transfer to 1st person.
---
Fallout 76, I fear, will be the destruction of an IP I loved for nearly 20 years.
---
Wat in the goddamn
---
I wouldn’t know what games OP worked on, but I’m almost certain they didn’t lose almost half their value within a week from launch and are being desperately bundled with anything two months after release.
---
I got to play for a couple of hours the other day after the patch because I was so excited about the patch and the game didn't crash once. I am just finally at level 60 and I don't understand alot of the complaints. I have seen white knight complaints? That a perk card? Never seen it. Nerfed? Not sure but that something got taken away or made worse? IDK . I am on xbox so I don't know how much time I have played. I work during the week so I don't play much then. I don't understand how players could be at the high levels they are and be bored with a game that just came out. I don't believe that level 150 and 200 players are the majority either and it is nice to see a post like this. Not emotional just matter of fact though I  was pretty upset this last weekend I made it through the glasses cavern and I got disconnected lost all my progress. Grr. . Anyway, good post.
---
That’s really cool 
---
Port?
---
&gt; Every fix in this patch is a fix that benefits the causal, average player.
---
How? I am a semi-casual player. I played too much to be casual, but I don't min-max. I just got my first and only SB queen kill (by accident) last week. I mostly wander around trying to find new stuff to craft and the materials to craft them with. 
---
This current patch or it's follow up "hot fix" did not directly benefit me in any way. In fact it makes me a bit upset that the few one star legendary guns I have are now worthless. I am also afraid to logon and forget and craft too much to try and learn a new weapon mod and get an account wide ban. So I've stopped playing FO76 entirely. 
---
Over 90% of your post amounts to "what these folks are unhappy about doesn't effect me, so eff those guys." There is a famous quote about that kind of attitude. Of the two alleged benefits to casuals you post, one is unsubstantiated (weight and dupers) and will affect casuals with a hoarding disorder. You neglect to mention that the other benefit comes with a substantial price hike to the recipes. Making that level 35 casual grind out several hundred more caps just for finding the lever action rifle plan the first time doesn't seem very casual friendly... and when he or she gets banned for making a bunch of them to scrap to learn the scope mod, well that's not casual friendly either. 
---
Nerf armour / defence, nerf melee = TSE meta again doesn't it?
---
They could easily enough make it so private servers exist with a thin connection to the Atom Store.
---
deadset cunt, mate.
---
No lol they are not. Having to craft/scavenge ammo already made them kind of a disadvantage against the OP melee builds, now there is literally no contest for what is the best choice. 
---
It's even more silly that a gun from the civil war era cam do more damage than a nuclear explosive weapon
---
I want this fixed as much as you do I promise,  bein anything but patient wont do anything  worth your time and that's what I'm doin. We all want what we want from this game but it ain't happenin in an instant so jus chill n play something else for a few weeks or relax n wait for March for some new content or survival maybe. It ain't worth gettin this stressed over. Ima keep playin for now as I'm having a decent time!! See you scavers in the wastes come pvp me n loot my junk if your still around
---
I mean he was obviously a gambling addict so hed probably have lost it all eventually regardless.
---
Oh yeah one last thing, you're gonna have to do better than the usual 'you're a kid' and 'you have no life' arguments. That's about 70% of all people here lol. You can do better then that little man. 
---
Ahh sorry wrong end of the stick... My thoughts exactly, but based on BSW track record; they're more likely to steal the code under "IP/Copyright infringement" and serve the modders with a C+D when they try to fight back. Legally they can, have, and probably will do this again.
---
OR - hear me out I know it’s crazy - Beth lets more than one player sell at a time because it’s 2019 and the technology exists.
---
Could be cos everyone's quit playing apart from 999 die hard fan's?
---
You quickly say when others use the phrase "most of us" that they clearly aren't and it literally makes you rage. Then...you go and use the phrase yourself.
---
You also don't speak for the fo76 community. Sorry. You don't. 
---
For fucks sake I was wondering what was happening to my bulk scrap.  Well, this is a swift kick in the nads.  
---
\+rekt
---
=drawboard
---
YEah, I saw that and rmeoved mine to get it to work. Thanks for the Info
---
You know bulking that makes no difference? Unless you're selling it?
---
They notice the feedback apparently and pass it on to the devs so my guess is yes
---
It's a known bug.  Well it's a bug known by people who play the game but not sure the devs have even been informed.  Not until a CM comes on and passes it to the team, but only when the topic has been reposted about 10 times.
---
When did they release the moth man paint?
---
The Babelfish! YES!
---
Seent the data mined files didn't know it dropped....🤔
---
Ultracite missiles would come in handy against Scorchbeasts. 
---
With how this is great and all one sentence made my friend say "Yeah nevermind to this thought".
---
What happens when a stupid punk names his shotgun N------ Blaster.
---
They changed that this patch so it doesn't block the headwear slot.
---
Evidently, that was done wrong as well...
---
Didn't someone post a screenshot of their challenge log at 760 hours yesterday?
---
These are good points but if we’re being honest Bethesda’s just gonna nerf bloodied and Melee and eventually you’ll probably get your chance at a level playing field. A sonic missile would be dope bc scorchbeasts need a taste of their own (annoying) medicine 
---
Believe BOS mods can be gotten from turning in technical data/forbidden knowledge quests
---
I won a revolver + one bullet. Very funny Bethesda.
---
Yeah it did genius.
---
If all my items were named "Bethesda" it would get very confusing quite fast!
---
Fake internet points. Bored at work? Likes to argue? I mean...you can make this feel god posts all day, but tbe objective reviews and misguided decisions of bethesda stand, no matter what people who posts these "alternative facts" posts say.
---
I have been having all these same issues before the last patch on PC.

I would get in Danger mode and there was nothing around.   I figure out what happens though.   Out on the edge of range, there was a mob that gets stuck on something (crack, piece of dirt, whatever) and then refuses to move.    I have found some mobs stuck under foundations, even during events.    Took me 10 minutes to get to the one Honey Beast at the Seneca Hotel thing.   Eventually the thing popped up from under the foundation, but timer was down to like 3 minutes.
---
The problem existed prior to the last patch.   Maybe its worse somehow?  Not sure, I will try it out this weekend. 
---
Not if x is a dollar! 
---
hah :)
---
It sounds visual only, which would mean it's not exploitable
---
I do the quests and actually explore the areas the quests are in, there are holo tapes everywhere, there are scraps of paper everywhere, there are stories from people that survived the initial fallout everywhere.
---
While everyone is farming legendary ghouls at white springs you can actually learn the story about the last few days when whitesprings kicked off the restoration project. you can read about what people thought was going on and when you do other missions you can later piece together what they didnt know.
---
you know what my kid asked me while playing the other day, "I wonder how &lt;insert something that you would learn about by reading  terminals in the game&gt;" literally all the time. 
---
There is SOOOOO much in this game that does work and is right that doesnt involve blowing off anyone's head. but it does require a bit of reading and hunting. 
---
people play fallout games and then turn and say bethesdas a piece of shit company because this actors models head spins wrong. This is the same as turning around and saying the DM of your D&amp;D campaign is shit because he didnt have a little pewter statue to represent your fighter so he used a tube a lip gloss. Or he drew part of the map on a napkin. 
---
Yes I like that, maybe as an upgrade to scorch buster to do even more damage to them
---
I did a shitload of farming and for what - JFC the comedy of errors continues.   
---
Memo to Bethesda- maybe you should test your “fixes” in a non-production environment to make sure the shit actually works first?   That’s pretty much what 99.9% of companies do before rolling out technology updates or upgrades.  
---
I feel they should just suspend the game for now. 
---
*Patience and understanding*
---
You could have just went with the easy subjectivity excuse, but instead *patience and understanding*. Christ ok
---
How does your gatling gun have a base damage of 132? That still sounds far too high
---
Bethesda just moved the power armor headlamp from the base game to the atom store. This seems like less of a mistake and more of a calculated move. Face it this game is a clusterfuck.
---
Well that’s just about the dumbest thing I’ve heard in a while.  Are you serious? I’d check but I uninstalled the game after the last patch
---
Oh man I laughed so hard I almost pissed myself, I’ll just quit making arguments since I haven’t been in this sub for two months... maybe I’ll get a responder (or maybe someone from the big bad enclave lmao) who’s been here 3 months, then your argument can be thrown out of the window.
---
Playing the game right now, and after checking my stats I’ve got exactly 352 hours on my only character. So I can definitely comment on what I think of the game. My main argument was that your argument’s just full of holes and written in the POV of an actual child.
---
It’s fine if you don’t like the game compadre, just make better arguments. Don’t make some stupid call-to-arms like everyone who enjoys the game is gonna throw their fun on the floor just because you don’t like the game. Don’t fabricate stories about how you’re this ultra-god at the game, and don’t make white lies about how the other games weren’t like this. It’s deplorable hearing people like you bitch and moan about a game that you’ve invested hours in. Nobody held you up at gunpoint and asked you to do any of that my friend. 
---
I think he will. I pre-ordered Oblivion, Skyrim, and FO3. Did not Pre-order FONV (but I liked it), nor FO4. I bought FO4 a few months ago, and did not buy FO76.
---
And I have never killed a SB. A high level player added me to his team once and they must of had  perks that helped me be in a nuked zone and it was so much fun to be a part of killing a SBQ but by myself I can barely get any damage done to a regular SB. I don't know how people do it.
---
How many caps per map you offering?
---
Of course they fixed the charge resetting to full. That was something that actually benefits the player. Can’t have that now could they😂
---
I imagine that there are hundreds of people who have, but when you compare it to the hundreds of thousands of players, the number of people who actually have 600+ hours is less than .01%
---
They were prepping for an election that was going to happen just about a week after the bombs dropped... and that kinda ruined Election Day ...
---
Please Review and Revise: Fissures: If you are pushed in or knocked in and die "Loot" should be at the top of the fissure for reclaiming. In water you can dive to get what you lost at death. There is NO WAY in Fissures.
---
Two Shot W/Exp: I get you wanted to lessen the power yet 25% is too low. 50% is more reasonable especially as it seems all enemies are acting as bullet sponges. I blew through nearly 1000 rounds in Heart of the Beast with enemies the rounds did NO Damage too from nearly all weapons. Only to have my completed journey restart after I was finished with the journey because I got swept into a fissure. So the system reset me to never having done the mission. 
---
Plus please undo the Nerf to Regular Two Shot weapons: I had a couple drop by over half power and now are paper weights. 
---
Next Up Perk Cards: Since you determined to change perk card percentages or nerf many, users should be allowed to redo skills or entire skill sets since their character was based on previously defined card data. You changed this mid-game and users should not be held accountable for your late dealings.  Many have spent hundreds of hours fine tuning their characters.  These changes seem capricious in nature and done with zero warning nor real explanation.  
---
Lastly: The PRICE INCREASE on Everything To buy Plans, Weapons anything the Sticker Shock is REAL! You limit us selling items for caps and then take items that were 300-600 one day and the next they are 3000-5000 caps. This is RIDICULOUS! Come on Bethesda, we are trying here and it feels like we just keep getting crapped on.
---
Please think about these issues and address them.
---
Haha. Me too. They should do more triggered events like that.
---
I really don't know why it has to be limited. Also, you should be able to invite people already in a team, instead of it just not sending the invite??
---
I love how people read stuff and add whatever context they feel. Who said anything about being mad.
---
I've gamed long enough to know tha'ts daft and I've got more important things to stress over if i wanted / needed to stress. 
---
Bethesda are just another bs gaming company trying to make a dishonest buck of the back off gamers. We did this to our selves by accepting mediocrity. The gaming industry is one of the only industries on the planet that allows companies to ship broken ass products and then seems entitled to let the customers wait around for fixes which in some cases never come.
---
In the mean time ill rag on Bethesda and there broken product cos why not? they deserve it! Purchased every fallout and ES title out there multiple times over the years as a loyal customer / fan the least they could do is be honest, but for some reason they are above that as well in the eyes of many. (shills and fanbois)

I would go to town on that base. My dream scenario of entering the golf area. 😂

This has to be a troll post.  The overseer is a badass.  
---
And you can still fight normally with your old TSE weapon, just that you have to shoot stuff a few more times now.
---
People ran around oneshoting stuff with half their weapons damage perks you tell me if it was balanced. 
---
When did I even say I was right?? What’s up with the homophobic remarks?? “Suck their knobs hard” I didn’t say they’re the greatest company on earth and that 76 is going to usher in the next golden age of gaming! I just like the fuckin game and you can’t formulate an argument or a valid response even if your life depended on it
---
Not sure why people are downvoting you. 
---
I’m on the higher end of being a casual player. I only get an hour or two of playing a few days a week now. At the start I played maybe 2-3 hours most days of the week. I’ve never really cared about perk cards or all the other stuff, I don’t even know what half the stuff is OP mentioned. 
---
I just like to build my little camp, do some missions and go exploring. I’m normally the base building/crafting type of person. Hell, I didn’t even finish Fallout 4 because I was too busy building massive bases with mods. 
---
This game has so much potential but every step of the way they ignore the things that people want and make the game slightly more arduous to do basic things. 
---
I wanted to move my camp the other day after being able to finally find the barn and metal plans (I’ve been playing since the first day of beta and don’t server hop so it’s been a long time).  It was frustrating to realize I had to unbulk all of my materials to build, more frustrating to find I barely had enough materials to build a new basic structure, then finding out there are some trees that aren’t removed when building forcing you to change your plan, then having parts of your camp stuck and unable to be destroyed or removed because of some bug. 
---
I now have to go out and search for materials that I otherwise could’ve just hoarded if there was a stash increase. Stuff I’ve already collected, bulked, and either sold or given away. Not to mention the weeks worth of saving up caps to have spent them all in one sitting to get basic plans. 
---
The worst part about it all is that my brother and I play together once or twice a month for maybe 4-6 hours. I live across the ocean and don’t get to see him ever really so it’s nice to be able to share this with him. He’s starting to hate the game though. He gets the worst bugs and when we play he constantly disconnects or freezes or dies or loses equipment because of bugs. It’s frustrating for both of us. 
---
Anyway, moral of the story is that what you’re saying is right. These patches and updates, while they hurt the dupers, exploiters, and grinders, they also hurt the average player and make the game a buggier, tedious, grind fest that most casual players can’t keep up with. 
---
He means osrs 
---
Sheesh. That’s such an eye opener 
---
I dont really keep track of the itemshop content, I just assumed it should be already out when it landed on my helmet 
---
&gt;Seven HUNDRED and sixty hours into a game that launched 79 days ago. I shouldn't have to point out everything wrong with that.
---
Found another way to play the game wrong.
---
Haha, I know too much about game development to think of professional game testing as a fulfilling career :D
---
Well, I was about to pay for Skyrim. Guess I don't have to now. Thanks Bethseda! Free games from Bethseda on thepiratebay.org!
---
Lol the average casual player is not playing with their spouse and it may only be for a few hours a week.
---
I do 1-2 turn ins every day, for three weeks in row now. Mostly get purified water. 
---
Yeah but no doubt they will fuck that up as well in typical Bethesda fashion.
---
Every time they pull that shit though they loose fans, the fallout generation and ES generation will only buy into Bethesda crap for so long, the next gen of gamers wont care they'll just buy and play a better quality of product and Bethesda will suffer in the long run.
---
Finally someone talking sense, i like you
---
Don't be an idiot, dude
---
I died randomly before the patch. Do you use a low health high rad build?
---
True, but about 80% of my fallout friends have also quit the game.  Most don't even know about reddit or what it is.
---
You have been hit by a Beholder for 20 damage.
---
Flee
---
I mean, if you cant read and never open terminals yeah thats pretty much it. 
---
You should also call out Tom Howard. 
---
My wife is the one that plays Fallout 76 (Xbox One X) and it is crazy how many times she gets disconnected a night. She only has a couple hours to play after work and some nights she just has to stop trying to play. 3 to 4 disconnects in less than an hour on some nights. Two nights ago she had 2 disconnects in 10 minutes. She just said 'I'm done trying' and gave up for the night. She really likes the game, but it frustrates her like crazy that she is sitting at a loading screen the majority of the time while I am on the PC gaming (not Fallout) with no connectivity issues. Also we have no connectivity issues on any other Xbox games.
---
I couldn't tell you how many times I've said this game should look to OSRS for how to run a game like this
---
Interesting blog from a game developer on some of the points op have in his post.
---
I would recommend this blog to anyone interested in the gaming industry. Blog really shine a light on many of the assumptions in many gaming subreddits.

It because Sam Blackwell defected to the Free States so theyre havibg an emergency election to replace him in congress
---
What a strange line of reasoning. You’re trying to support your claim that the original question is not civil conversation by comparing asking a question about gender equality to that of casual rape, all while admitting (to say the least) that you’re resorting to hyperbole. 
---
No, it’s nothing like asking, “how often do you rape your wife”. It’s not even close.
---
I can’t speak to the accuracy of the underlying premise of the OP’s post, because I haven’t explored enough of the FO76 world to have a view on the make up of the characters Genders and positions of power.
---
That being said, it is unusual for there to be ‘only female characters’ when it comes to leading roles etc. That’s not the same as saying this in of itself is a problem, is offensive or is disturbing. Maybe it’s simply coincidental. Or not. I suspect not. I suspect it’s part of a general drive within the media to portray women as strong independent characters. This has been discussed numerous times in mainstream newspapers, and irrespective of ones own personal views of the morality of such approaches, the fact is, it is an approach and pointing it out shouldn’t be such an issue to you. 
---
Instead of engaging with the OP, correcting them, or providing a counter argument, you’ve been dismissive. This is a profoundly unintellectual response.
---
Because the OPs is technically correct.  The 'hot' portion of 'hotifx' has changed over time from meaning *'a live system'* to *'skipping normal patch protocol'*.  Although it's quite likely a lot of development teams still adhere to the original meaning.   This sub is still cancer notwithstanding.
---
I've not only noticed this but food in my inventory spoils much faster than it ever has before.
---
You're pretty dense man. I'm not gonna repeat myself so i'll take it slowly. My end game fun, like many others, was to collect basically as much stuff as possible. I had (and still have) a very unique and damn good build. I kept playing a couple of hours a day for the past few weeks becaise I honestly believed that bethesda was going to do something. But three months and not  a decent patch to show apart from tse nerfs, which took nearly two months to patch duping. The devs and this game needs a 180 you can't defend their total lack of testing and actual efforts. Which means you came here to be an arse at me. I don't think i'm the one that needs a life here buddy. 
---
It's clear most people here never played Morrowind or even Oblivion. If they did they must have HATED them.
---
I use sneak build with leather armor. I logged in and all my gear just broke literally. And then I died lol
---
Looking at these comment threads i'm not sure if OP is a shitty troll or just stupid
---
Says the guy that doesn't understand the reason or motives of this post. Just stop. 
---
Every time the fan boi's come out in force Bethesda release an even weaker fix / patch etc.
---
Bethesda are a joke and couldn't get this mess up to launch standard even if they were given 5 another 2 years.
---
It is a rip from fo4 with multiplayer tacked on....did they expect it to work do you think or did they know it was going to be a shit show, but Atoms win lol
---
I do why?
---
I prefer to make the ammo hard to find but being killing machines rather than this
---
Oh look the lone voice of reason getting downvoted because they can see where this is going.
---
This idea is bad, eventually you get some one that makes op weapons that get everything nerfed a better mid ground is to say "let us find legendary one time use mods we can attached to weapons"
---
Thank you. I’ll be reading it shortly...
---
It’s not a bug, it’s their latest feature to help us stay in the game longer!!  
---
OMG... Well. I can't say I'm shocked, I kinda had a feeling. 😒
---
But thanks for the info anyway. 
---
I never left my dude i just... Oh... You mean him... 
---
I do, what do you want for it?
---
I wonder if there has been a decrease in the number of players in the game, and if this has something to do with server stability? 
---
How does this post change a fact that this game is a fucking disaster and easely one of the most dissapointing games of the year?
---
Even my bright headlight mod flags my helmet as an ATOM shop item... making it untradeable. Back to the OP's topic.. that is very weird! Are you on PC? There is a chance that someone broke into the dev room, added the mothman light to a helm, placed it on a frame out in the world, and you picked it up. There are thousands of people that unknowingly have unreleased things. IF you get banned (highly unlikely), you can create a trouble ticket with Bethesda, explaining you situation. Take pics!
---
Exactly. I was lucky and saw that I had too many round numbers of stuff to be scrapped when I went to do a bulk scrap. Until they fix it, I guess I will scrap more often, or try to only pick stuff I actually need and forget about selling the stuff I don't need. 
---
check cheeseburger cake channel on youtube. I think he breaks 17k with a half-assed build.
---
RIP plastic
---
If you don't freeze up. I have to log in and out a minimum of three times before my game will not freeze. What is sad is that the other players on the server will be continuing to play as I've listened to the pianos play and enemies attack, but my character doesn't move. I can fast travel even, but when the screen loads I'm back to a frozen fpv. 
---
My fiance hasn't played on PC since the first update that locked in the fps. Her game is pixelated to the point that she'd rather play Star Dew Valley, a pixelated game. 
---
I'm mostly tired of those that one-shot the legendary enemies in events. Even high level players does this.
---
Oof.
---
Guess I'm playing on my alt-char :( 
---
A better suggestion would be to create one time useable mods that i can attach to other items from legendary weapons. 
---
Then you dont end up with a crafter that can create imbalanced weapons. 
---
We all flock to the SBQ when the quest begins you shall never be alone fellow wastelander
---
There's still MUDs going strong - I still play the Discworld MUD, which has been going since 1992, and is still being constantly developed by volunteer creators adding more and more content to it every single year, all keeping in the theme of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series of books.  
---
There's even slightly modern client-packages for the Discworld, which will give you more of a "UI" to your mudding, with separated out, tabbed chat windows, a graphical map that follows you around and lets you click around it to speedwalk and find places, a database to search for items/locations/npcs, and all sorts else to make it feel a LITTLE more modern to play (but still very much a pure text-based MUD) if you want!
---
I dunno, as I said on another post, I am not a fan boy of the game, and haven't been since the first xbox beta play, but I paid my $70 for this disaster, so I guess I will have to keep playing, at least until there is another game I find, and can convince my wife to let me buy it. 
---
I would actually buy it for my son for PC but Bethesda is still acting like it's worth $60. I'd think about it for $20. That's still $20 more than it's worth.
---
My thoughts as well.  Less players.  Less issues
---
i dont think your supposed to kill the wise ones. 
---
"But it hurt my feelings"
---
wait what? Iception? The Matrix?
---
If you're not here how are you posting....

[Mind Blown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oQM4H9ql7A)
---
I mean your main premise just isn’t correct. Or correct all the time, at the very least. Plenty of games cater to the 1% grinders and are successful because of it. 
---
Destiny 2 is a great example. At release it was widely criticized for being too casual of an experience and players left the game altogether because there was a broad feeling of nothing to do. They have gradually made it more grind-y and have implemented more things tailored toward the hardcore crowd and the game has new life. 
---
Bulking scrap has become more important because 1) they nerfed the shit out of many items, 2) because they nerfed the shit out of many items many of us have to adjust our build or weapons and then there’s 3) one way to adjust is to purchase items or craft them which requires either scrap or scrap to be used to buy caps to purchase other stuff.  Maybe you weren’t aware but the cost of just about everything went up exponentially with the patch earlier this week.  All in all it’s a cluster but that’s par for the course at this point. 
---
Agreed
---
Well, the game actualy sucks, tho...
---
okay so I found a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alo0gk/bethesda_if_you_make_the_red_tactical_headlight/) that clarifies what happened to me, I had a red lamp installed (which I forgot as I wasn't using an incomplete set) and because there is some issue with implementing the Mothman PA paint from the shop it somehow converted my regular Red lamp into this mothman abomination which is tagged as Itemshop content  
---
Hey, hold my caps and watch this.
---
If you aren’t supposed to have it yet I would take it off and scrap or throw it away
---
&gt;:(
---
And don't pretend to come here to get a constructive argument back, when you start the conversation with 'you're a kid' and 'get a life'. Got a lot to learn kiddo
---
I'm a casual trying to min-max a BIT. I want to enjoy to enjoy this game as much as possible and will wade though the bad times, bugs, funky patches, server crashes, and more.
---
I have a wife, I'm a full-time college student, Have an adult life, and working on buying my second house. This game is a distraction between online homework, researching home improvement, essays, reading books, dare nights, cooking new meals, finding my perfect bagel joint in the Upper West Side, the gym, commuting, football (go Steelers), Rugby (Cymru am byth!) and so much more. 
---
Yeah, I wish energy weapons were better, I wish enemies weren't bullet sponges, I hate grinding for caps... But I'm busy and I'm enjoying the snippets I get.
---
I've played every game since Fallout 2 when I discovered it in 2000. Nearly 19 years of fallout games.
---
76 will get there. And I'm loving it.
---
I'll message ya.
---
Yes, yes and yes. 
---
I always do. Still nothing.
---
Thanks, will definitely give that a try.
---
I don't remember that happening a month or two ago.
---
What is afk?
---
ok go back to your leapfrog games youve lost the right to an opinion
---
You mean they automatically show up in my inventory? That's why I keep getting 50+ water that I sell, or drop due to weight concerns. Well, I do occasionally play with no camp thanks to a couple people snagging my spot. So I still like the option of being able to carry a couple filters, and even more, if I want to make them, I shouldn't have to worry about the auto scrap monster taking them away from me. Same with my bulk junk as well. 
---
People accuse those angry that Bethesda pulled another fast one of being in a circlejerk while also participating in a circlejerk of their own
---
ye but one sucking is worth 50 bucks so it is nice return.
---
Why are you on the fallout 76 Reddit then?
---
OP, there is a difference between serverside hotfix and a client side hotfix. Bethesda most often do client side hotfixes, where as serverside hotfixes might be implemented without us knowing at all. 
---
Did you just post a question and answer it yourself?
---
Fanboism is strong with this one!
---
That PS4 part is bullshit. That only happens if you open your Pip-Boy while your body's still invisible, NOT when you "move too early" and "you'll have to stand around for 2 minutes" to fix it
---
Agreed. Might get me back on the game
---
Thanks for testing that! WTF, how do they manage to break so much stuff every time they fix something else?
---
Have people stopped one shotting her? I could never even see the thing before she died. It was always like 10 seconds after she appears too
---
Why does it matter... They're fixing something in the game and that should make you happy. Plus servers don't need to be online for it to be called a hotfix.. People just try to find anything to complain about with this game. 
---
Your joke was "tasteless"
---
Yes, apparently the bright lamp for PA but also the pip boy lamp now are tagged with the atom simbol
---
In my experience, after using this trick, Fallout76.exe hangs with 100% usage of all its assigned cores and becomes unresponsive right after entering the world.
---
Yeah, this happened once to me with a Super Mutant, And also to my own face when I was taking pics at Wreckyardhenge, which was so appropriate.;I just look like the master of mystery.
---
The gatekeeping is so bad on Star Trek rn. Add to that a bunch of Discovery lovers who are very insecure about their tastes, and all the "well the new Star Trek stuff isn't canon so if you like it you're not a real fan" and it makes for a shitty Reddit experience. Can barely ask lore questions without people shooting you for "criticizing" lol
---
Fuck gatekeeping. I wanted to like FO76 but I'm not stupid and I can see the problems with it. Hopefully in a few years it'll go No Man's Sky...
---
17k on his rad rage build yeah I have seen it. Does *Not* mean melee is OP. You have to take in to account the fact he is proccing multiple perks on top of his armor to be able to do that damage. If you reverse his build (which I have) in to a ranged build the damage becomes insane as well. But never the less in order for his build to work you are 1-3 hits from dying at any given time. Thats not what I call OP. 
---
I do it so that I can keep an easy accounting of my storage. I am saving up to sell a bunch of junk and ammo one day. 
---
I just hit level 35 and the most frustrating thing for me is I can't pick level 3 locks. Game runs great for me, and has only crashed a fraction of the times that New Vegas did at launch (which makes me wonder if New Vegas launched today, it would have been obliterated by the same group). I will admit that the stash size has made me change my play style, which could be classified as heavy hoarder, and now I only loot what I can use, sell, or I have marked for search. 
---
This game has a very fun map to explore, and to me, has some of the best environmental storytelling I have ever seen. 
---
I have been a fallout fan since the orgional, and I am enjoying this game, just hit 76 hours! 
---
Thank you OP for being the voice of reason, now let the downvotes begin!
---
You know who else wanted refunds for FO76? Hitler.
---
did you learn you could you get the excavator power armor plans and power armor crafting station for free in the quests long before this point? cause literally all the stuff people bitch about not know is learned in quests, the reason they dont flat out tell you is because its basically a spoiler because now your like whats the ultra cite armor? whats the excavator power armor, what is that guy wearing?
---
Buy them a steak dinner to make up for it
---
I have tried to use math and logic to make points in similar subreddits, and honestly, I hope you are having more luck with this thread than I have had.  Reddit users, commenters, and posters are very close to zero percent of the userbase of *most* things those people are commenting and posting about, yet they also tend to think they are some huge demographic.  I enjoy employing math and logic to makes arguments on reddit and engage in debate, but it hardly ever goes "well."
---
Yeah where are those? Did they also give up despite entranching themselves?
---
It's gone the other way for me, last 5 fights I have attended she still had quarter health when time ran out...
---
Holy crap that's neat!
---
You can say whatever you want about Fallout 76 but the game should never have been released in the state it was and is still barely worth a release. I've put a couple of hours into it and it feels like a Fallout 4 mod that was extremely poorly optimized and is in version 0.1, they should have just slapped the early access sticker on it because that's what it is. An alpha.
---
Sometimes I'd just like to move my entire structure about 4 feet over, but still within the green circle (without paying for it)
---
Nope it was yellow, bright yellow. Not tan
---
World of Warcraft at least has the luxury of being nearly two decades old though. 
---
True, but irl we don't have to deal with radiation in the water. That said, even 5 uses would be better. Especially since they are a pain in the arse to make. 
---
Text chat. Clan tags.
---
I do the same, equip white knight just for the reduced repair costs.   To be honest, the junk cost is not really that big a deal.  Takes what? 10 mins to scavenge that amount of components?
---
I have solo'd all the way through, never teamed up, as have many others...
---
... The game is still really bad, is a total scam for what it was priced, is one of the biggest 
---
game release failure, was made with an outdated engine and uses assets from older games that you have to pay for to use them now... Has a 50% review on meta critic and now ppl from Gamestop Germany just started to give copies of this game FOR FREE to get rid of it. So maybe there is too much outrage regarding last patch... But there is way not enough outrage regarding Bethesda scamming everyone. Or maybe you guys just love acting like an ostrich, paying for a full priced Mercedes and burying your head in the sand so you don't realize you actually got a broken Lada. Buying this game, playing it, is just supporting ppl who only sees you as wallets. So please don't
---
Stealth has always had issues. Hopefully bethesda is aware of these issues.
---
Primarily the occasional glitched "1,000+" perception enemies who can spot you automatically whereas the rest have a difficult time finding you.
---
That and sneak attack bonuses are disabled when 2 enemy factions are fighting or when other players are present.
---
How do you trade to oneself though? 
---
good luck. anything physics-based from 4 was removed. we can’t pick up &amp; hold objects anymore. we can’t throw those objects. anything that we drop goes into a brown paper bag. so i’d day that the junk jet is out of the question. 
---
It's not SUPER BAD, it's just mediocre and broken, and the developer keeps making it worse. Not talking about the nerfs, I'm talking about the numerous bugs and frequent crashes. The issue is that in [Current Year], AAA titles and in turn, their developers, have zero excuse to be mediocre. I've said it before and I've said it again, it's a case of a game giant getting fat and lazy from success and trying to push something out by name alone. The failures of F76 and Bethesda as a whole in handling this game should be a humbling wake up call, and in a perfect world, that will be enough to make their next game better: the fear that they aren't untouchable
---
Could be.   I’ll take it though because I’m not crashing:) 
---
Bye.
---
Have they also lowered disease resistance? 
---
I’m in PA and the other night when I was playing I got a disease every time I fought an enemy. Like 6 or 7 times in a couple hours. 
---
I genuinely like this - it fits very well in the world!
---
That’s the same reason why I think I’ll keep it for another six months or so. I don’t want to have to wait 3 days for it to re-download if I ever want to play again. 
---
Great, I JUST finished my camp and was happy with it and then you come along and show me how to do something I've wanted to do forever with curved walls.
---
Guess I'm starting over!
---
You are not going from fully satiated to starving in 5 minutes. You just aren't.
---
That's what I've been saying for a few days now (check my post history)! I have also noticed there are more mannequins in the game the past couple weeks! Maybe it's a slow build to an event or maybe I just need to be sober more often when I play but, I know my little corner of the map like the back of my hand and there are deffenitly more mannequins in my area. 
---
As long as you take time to level up before just pounding one quest after another you will be OK, always check no higher levels are where you're headed, they will spawn enemies that will wreck you...
---
Should your body really be invisible when you log in? Is that how you know the game is working properly? the fact that I have to avoid opening or using something in the game in order to prevent it from breaking is fucking insane
---
Solo play is viable for everything except Scorched Earth
---
Atleast mine do.   I typically let it get to 25 or 30 before I sell to vendors or drop for noobs @v76
---
I would run some events in the easier area around vault 76 to level up a bit, the game gets easier to handle at higher levels. You said you don't really mess with power armor but I would consider it, the cores run out much slower than they did in FO4 and it will do wonders for your survivability. All issues aside the game can be very fun if you just explore and relax imo. 
---
I’ve only teamed up to launch nukes but if that’s not top priority than yes it’s very very do able
---
All guns? Try stop using a sledgehammer and come back here.
---
That's cute. Sniper builds are garbage in fallout as I stated in my original edit of my comment stating *unless you are running a stealth ranged build in which case yes you will be pummeled to death* So yes I stand by my prior statement that you dont know how to build a character for the weapon you are using and OR the situation in which you are in.The beauty of fallout 76 is versatility the ability to be able to change your build on the go in accordance with what you need at the time. I mean I have built builds in this game strictly for carrying junk for god sakes so you will not tell me it can not be done. If you are ranged and you are killed by a melee then you are not a good ranged player. Truth is you are probably one of the derps that run *dodgy* on your range build and then wonders why he cant out run a melee build 😂
---
Things must be different on ps4 or i'm incredibly lucky. Playimg using my phone tethered to my console and have few disconnects (recently moved, still price shopping for ome internet)
---
What makes SBQ unplayable for me is the mahoosive FPS drops while fighting her
---
Agreed... BSW was one of very few companies that I'd actually re-order to (before all of this nonsense) but any goodwill they had they seem to be happy to piss away in the most baffling ways imaginable... like some stuff going down I wouldn't expect from a c-rate, indie, mobi, games developer, and we have Bethesda an AAA games company pulling it?!
---
It's a sad time for loyal gamers atm...
---
I bought the centennial edition, trust me I wish I was the opposite and instead we were all talking about all the cool upcoming PvE content.
---
As much as I agree with a lot your saying I don't think the plan changes are good.
---
They are still somewhat randomized and the prices are insane. That combined with cap stash/cap collector nerf and I don't see new players make end meet. All the min maxers on f76 market forums don't use caps as a currency - they barter, so it doesn't affect them that much. This change hits lowbies and camp builders the most.
---
I played legit solo. No problems. Healing items are easy to craft\have.
---
I would simply suggest, keep up on ammo and weapons and to make sure you have a few stims\salves.  Make sure to always have a melee weapon even if your not melee focused.
---
Keeping up, i mean in levels not just maintaining.
---
I have, I still come here to read stupid shit like this and what the new "patch" broke.  
---
And because I live in Australia I got my money back for buying this crap and it has never been removed from my account. And yet I still don't play it.  
---
Have fun.
---
So that makes it ok? wtf? :D
---
those are probably an indicator of how many times this was dupped because you dont really build more than one or two of them. 
---
No, it's definitely new since patch 5 but not too bad once you know how to avoid it and the overall load times are shorter for me as long as I wait to use the Pip-Boy.
---
Also, i think we're way past the moment we could dream of bethesda giving a fuck. If nothing that happened until now made them change, uninstalling the game wont help neither
---
You can totally fast without crafting anything, just drink water or something.
---
How would one transfer items to another account safely by oneself? We have to hold a button to initiate trade, right? 
---
You need more hobbies and commitments, there's more to life than just grinding a game.
---
And you should be able to store your power armor on display in your shelter.
---
Thanks for confirming. Have a good day!
---
Are Super Mutants male? Or asexual but masculine? We saw in West Tek that one of the victims/pioneers of science was female, then listened to her holotape as she mutated.
---
Considering she *somehow* survived being heavily injured by the Mole Miners, *without* any Stimpaks or ammo left mind you, she's very much a badass in every sense of the word.
---
This has been a problem for well over month now
---
You too, let me know if it doesn't work for you so I don't get others hopes up but it's been a lifesaver for me.
---
Idk
---
My QE (quad explosive) radium got nerfed and it only does 63 damage now.
---
I think it only did 176 damage before the nerf. I just saw a post about a guy with a deathclaw that's doing 2k damage. But tell me again how OP my 176 damage radium rifle was......thanks for encouraging Bethesda to nerf my gun.
---
Try not to be ignorant. Not every gun with two shot or explosive is a TSE and not every melee weapon is a 2k DMG deathclaw.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you. That guy sounds ridiculous.....but don't discredit the complaints of those effected by the nerf. Not every TS or E weapon was OP.
---
You need to worry about yourself. I’ll do what I enjoy doing 
---
Bunch of fucking bottom feeders.
---
I like to keep tabs.
---
So what your saying is, your now a filthy Casual with now way to mask your not (i.e. TSE is garbage). Welcome Friend!! BTW the way I never got the awesome "TSE guns" up to this point Because I'm Casual. Doesn't affect my gameplay.
---
Oh just noticed the part about lv203 - 600 hours gameplay.... Go home your drunk bro! As a Casual, I'm lv 70 been playing since B.E.T.A.
---
Luckily I dont play anymore...
---
It ia supposed to be a raid. But sbq scales in defenses and hp the more ppl that are there.
---
Mind you all people should be decently leveled sbq is level 95.
---
Skate or die
---
I have 4 hours in the game and bought a week after launch 
---
Not sure then, that sucks. I have a shack but only because I am a minimalist when it comes to building 
---
Nobody is denying that the game can be fun, but anyone who still disregards all the shitty decisions made by bethesda, in these past few weeks (bringing back old bugs, banning players for crafting too much, etc) are acting idiotic.
---
Yes, PS4 supports SSD. And swapping the drive couldn't be easier (there's even instructions in the PS4 manual). It's just a bit time consuming depending on how much you need to back up prior to the swap and reinstall afterwards. You can backup save data to online storage if you're a PS+ member, then just backup everything you care about in your capture gallery to an external drive. Install SSD, download latest system software from the PlayStation website onto a USB drive, and install it onto your new blazing fast PS4. Reinstall games and save data, profit.
---
How many months would you consider 'a chance' then?
---
Niantic made the very same mistakes as here with the first two yrs of Pokemon go (no communication, reintroducing bugs with patches, server unreliability, wierd update schedule), now they have arguably the largest app game in the world, yet the gaming media conveniently forgets that when reporting on fo76.
---
Yep bobble heads got fixed now they dont stack any more just refresh the timers. Since tses got nerfed havent seen a single one hit kill. 
---
Same here, play every day regardless of what ever tantrum this board is having. 
---
Yes. Like I thought this was going to be a really funny joke while requesting a decent and needed feature.  Turns out hes serious and has a good idea.
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question or I missed something but did they change the disease resistance or infection rate? 
---
The last couple times I’ve played after the patch I’ve gotten diseases every time I’m in combat in full PA. Just minutes after taking disease cure I would get another disease... 
---
Im curious how many peoplr there were and how many there were doing nothing.
---
Bethesda know how many copies they sold and they can easily know how many people are logged in to their servers. Trust me, they know how bad the game is performing
---
There's one in the Overseer's House in Sutton
---
I'm not sure if it was removed or not, but that's where I grinded for my Caps early on (pick up stash, leave server, spawn on the outskirts of Sutton, sprint to house, rinse repeat)
---
Just gonna rebute a couple things you cannot Nerf something by 300% that would put the damage into the negative, in truth it was closer to a 70% which was done to bring those legendary effects in line with others.
---
Tse was nerfed because it was brokenly op compared to every single other legendary effect it had nothing to do with PvP
---
A literal perfect melee build which takes 4 people to pull off BTW due to how it works only does about 33k a swing and that's with stupid perfect timing that will never happen in any normal situation, a far more normal number is about 3k per swing for melee unless they are at critical hp at which point 10k is possible but nowhere near 10000000 dps and you seem to forget that's to a single Target and they have to be close. This isn't a pre Nerf tse double barrel wiping out a whole dungeon in one shell from the next town over. https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/highest-two-handed-damage-possible/ (helped the guy with this guide take a read)
---
That's about it the rest I pretty much agree with.
---
Also that tag at the end talking about how your a "mature adult" and a former game dev honestly just devalues your position as your position should stand on it's own merit regardless of whom is speaking it, that and this is the internet people are more likely to think your a AI or a talking dog than a game developer when you use it to defend a position 
---
Yeah, that would be much better. While I don't have 300 ms ping, there are some times where the game freezes for 5 to 10 seconds, and I'm going to assume it's my wireless internet as wired isn't an option. 
---
Because there were no reviews warning me I would be sick because everyone else who went to the restaurant said 'OMG STOP TELLING ME IT MAKES PEOPLE SICK SMH'.
---
I started playing rdr2 😉
---
I'l be back when it's fixed.😁
---
Well it certainly looks like someone is just going through this thread downvoting everything. Even civil discussion.
---
Yes I completely agree with you, fellow gamer! Those people demanding unrealistic things from BSG should relax by browsing the new items at the Atomic Shop! Bethesda should be given the benefit of the doubt and their hard work appreciated! With new exiciting titles such as Starfield and The Elder Scrolls coming out in the near future, we should all go out and pre-order and buy my game and support us in the future. 
---
All these posts are pretty subjective. Fast travel costs depend on where your CAMP is located. 
---
Based on my CAMP placement, i can hop to my CAMP between some of these vendors and have a travel cost lower than your cheapest route. 
---
The key is that you should run between: 
---
(flatwoods and sutton station) 
---
(Whitesprings/station and the whitesprings bunker)
---
(Watoga train and watoga BOS Vendor)
---
Thats 600 vendor caps on 3 or less fast travels, depending on your CAMP location..
---
And when you get enough players in them they start to run like shit, Sure rust is cool but what good is a game when you get weekly wipes on the most popular servers? why do you think 3x+ resources and 1/2- crafting requirements end up with so much shit everywhere.
---
its not a limitations with the engine or hardware issue is just that players dont have any clue what it takes to run a server well when you have people insistent on trying to fill it with 4 million stacks of bulk items. 
---
Actually the folks who have played the longest seem to be the most entitled especially after a patch!
---
Check the dupes and haters claiming they’ve got hundreds of hours of game play invested. Read their rants about how bethesda must bow before them lolz
---
As to your point about tall folks with access to everything I suspect the duping is much more prevalent then folks know 
---
It was easier to emasculate the TSE and explosive then arbitrarily hunt down and delete everyone with bootleg gear.
---
In IT you manage groups of users not specific ones. 
---
Keep it that way, for the memes!
---
If this 'new attitude' would put you off making games then you'd quickly find yourself unable to tolerate owning a company in any industry.
---
Solo is fine. I rarely group, but look at times when I stumble into someone else as fun highlights - they are often cooperating to finish a goal. 
---
In my experience, it's easier with fewer players as her health multiplier seems greater than that 'extra' players damage. 
---
Go in with 2-3 players and you'll have more success than 8+
---
like a lot of other things that seem like it would have been common sense,
---
"the team is aware and they are working on a fix that will come in a future update."
---
About normal, 8 to 10 maybe, all plugging away with miniguns, TSE and other legendarys, when she lands about 5 or 6 melee the fuck out of her, myself included....
---
I wonder if they're testing if they can take all this current drama and shift it towards politics.  See if it's possible to derail this community, like other non-political communities have experienced where accounts similar to this one roll in and bring up topics like this. 
---
Well pack it up boys. Everyone has it wrong. Fallout 76 was a resounding success. Bethesda did nothing wrong. if you're upset go F yourself. You're hurting the feelings of a multi-billion dollar corporation. Shame on you dumbass gamers and players. 
---
No, just the regular gatling laser plans, it's been 26 days since I posted this, but I think it was regarding an Ultracite mod for the laser that dropped from the SBQ. B/c it was too truncated too read when I clicked it I was looking for an actual ultracite gatling laser under the energy weapon's crafting section. I still haven't bought those plans to see whether it is that or not, since I don't use a heavy or energy build. 
---
After buffing explosives remember to make the ammo weight tenfold so no one can use it...
---
Or Bethesda is banning people who craft over 20 items at a time. Maybe you should have done your research
---
It should work that way... But unfortunately, as irl, many ppl are just behaving like stupids and they will just do what commercials tell them to. And even if it's not representing the vast majority of consumers, it is still enough to create profit. Especially if it requires zero to little investment in the first place. Like fo76 made with an old engine, in the same way they made their previous games, and using assets and code from previous games too. 
---
If it happens to enough other people, what are they all lying? C'mon man, common sense
---
They need to increase the numbers of spawns for ballistics fibers in the world. 
---
Go play destiny 2 for awhile and imagine if fo76 ran that smoothly... I switched back and now I'm just watching for when they get the bugs worked out... then I'll come back...
---
That's a solid list. 
---
I dont think 'millions' of people play this game-- I would be surprised if you had a total cap pop of over 500,000. 
---
Nope just RNG welcome to fallout 76
---
I love these posts from people in denial. "Most people play the game as casuals LOL BETHESDA DIDNT MAKE THE GAME FOR YOU TRYHARDS", "DUDE IT TOOK BETH FOREVER TO DO DLC FOR F04 SO YO, THIS SNAIL'S PACE SPEED OF DEVELOPMENT IS OK. YOU ARE SO ENTITLED GOD "   
---
This isn't how a game survives. This is going to go down as a textbook example of what not to do. 
---
I learned typing cheats for age of empires
---
800 for the set? Nice. Now waiting for a generous seller on PC.
---
I agree. They can fix their own trash. They should also figure out their own damn problems, too. They get paid, whereas, the modders provide a free service. Maybe Bethesda should hire modders to fix their damn game and stop this cycle of stupid bullshit they are stuck in.
---
That would be cool.
---
I can't wait for official mod support, this fommunity is having some really cool ideas.
---
I tried this with my FX-8350 and everything seems to be working. under the "set affinity" tab, it says its using cores 2-7 while core 0 and 1 are unchecked. my next step is making sure my overclock settings are applying to all cores.
---
My boy, the only time that this could crash someone’s game is if he was dumping those items that he got excessively. And I’m gonna guess you’re new to the community, so you should know. The servers crashing are Bethesda’s incapability to make simple, stable servers that can support the amount of resources that people can carry and how much they can craft. He got banned because he crafted over 20 items at once and Bethesda was like “oh wait, we can’t do that that’s illegal”
---
Solo play is very viable. You just have to keep your head on a swivel during your lower levels. It gets easier as you gain levels, get PA, and better weapons.
---
Right? I had limited play windows throughout December, and each time I tried to play I had gamebreaking issues. Last month I had more time to play, and faced even more game breaking issues.   
---
I wanted to play this game, but it's been a nightmare. 
---
That's because if you like the game and try to defend the game you get labeled as Bethesda defender. I think this game can have potential I like it but that doesn't mean I like how Bethesda treat's it. They're shit with it and should switch to server management like in ARK or Conan exiles and allow mods. Than fo76 could shine it's true potential.
---
Enjoying the game
---
Level 35 - exploring, seeking the lore ... in no rush to level up
---
To me it feels like continuation of FO-4 :)  
---
thought it was just me.
---
Food, water and fusion core drains seem faster. 
---
Yup, and you got what you deserved, a handful of downvotes
---
The End.
---
oh no, that extra 15 HP can make you take an extra hit from a lvl 5 glowing radroach! (for the few days that it'll last)
---
Agreed. I honestly think the game is fun, and while bugs are annoying, the most common complaints me and my friends have are just we would like more storage space. We also would like the power fantasy that other titles give you of having every perk, but we know it doesn't really work for a multiplayer title. We don't encounter too many dupers. You never need more than 10 Bobby pins so we don't care about that shit. We live through the crashes. We would like stabilization and better frame rate and hopefully it comes, but for now we play. PvE is very fun. Quests are actually interesting (listen to the holotapes and read the terminals), and the world is very beautiful. It's a great casual experience, and since I get home at 8:30 at night (hour and a half commute after an hour at the gym), we don't have much time to play, and it puts the game at a reasonable pace honestly. I'd say more but the main reason I post this is to reinforce your statement/opinion.
---
It's a viable method. Monsters will get tougher if more than one player is near them, but teaming should make it easier. Is teaming up necessary? Not really. Some perks get their maximum potential, but it seems like soloing is taken into consideration with the game design.
---
Upon spawning the nearby player(s) determine monsters' levels, so you could try to hopping servers if you encounter way higher variants of them.
---
Later in the game, you'll be able to be affected by mutations without ever losing them from healing your radiation. Some of them make the combat more or less easier.
---
Ya'll just finding anything to cry about, now lmaoooooo
---
It’s painfully broken at present. How do they fuck this up so badly..
---
Before I rebuttal, thank you for actually giving some reasons. 
---
A) The voiced is personal preference so omitting that.  Sure the leveling system could have potential and is neat. However, from what gathering they nerf OP mods and explosive perks. Since it is still working on FO4 system,  enemies are still bullet sponges with melee being completely unbalanced in a online environment.  Sure it works in single player but creates balancing issues. Also nerfing a perk because people are using it "too much" seems odd choice especially for a non damage perk(the repair). I never really knew there was a "best" mod in FO4 because if something didn't work I just lower difficulty and went on way. (Which btw melee best mod because how dmg works).
---
B) Um, maybe bit cleaner but using same engine and assets as FO4, environment is pretty much the same.  If look hard enough can easily find copy paste. It's common in games. 
---
C) Reskin or copy of FO4 models and animations. I'm not dissing them for that,  but not going to to praise for triggers being added to them.  Also,  if server isn't stable enough,  it makes it hard to attack with server ticks(missed attacks or invisible attacks). 
---
D) I mean might expect to add something that wasn't taken from FO4 or Skyrim. Also adding to that,  from what gathered energy weapons are lacking.  Not very weapon friendly when seems like punishing you for not using the common gather weapon. 
---
E) A water down and restricted settlements.  Sure might of added some things to them that I'm sure they got idea from modes. 
---
F) As fun as that is, yes story and characters are good but how is that different from any another title or game?
---
G)I have no really remark on photo mode but to play devil advocate....hey good for them to add something recent games titles have already done.
---
H) The multiplayer system is bit unfriendly,  correct me if I'm wrong,  you can't share camp access or even build together(which is what they made it seem like in show casing it). Vending items to players is impossible,  you can't make a shop. Last checked trading was easier to just drop the items.  It is very unfriendly system for player to player interaction. 
---
And lastly,  sure may got hp fixed a bit but like said it is still tilted combat in FO. It only took them two games to fix the hp increase on enemies.  Sure SB need group,  unless there is large group making it stronger which invites more trolls and leeches than a challenge. 
---
I think the worse thing is, which yes this happens in all online based games,  the community.  There were people attacking other players because they  thought they were duping, because ppl are easily finding exploits because spaghetti code that Bethseda do not know how to fix correctly or had to. People are reporting of being ban from all games,  including the offline ones,  because they are crafting too fast. They build the patch on an old build. How are these acceptable for a major company?
---
I usually get an item if the legendary has at least 1 star. The ones with just LEGENDARY in their name sometimes drop nothing.
---
&gt; As stated in the patch notes for Patch 5
---
Well, the OP is level 75, so any level restriction on the Heavy Combat Armor plans should not be an issue.  Not to mention he and many others saw one plan one day, but not the others, then nothing.
---
We console scrubs need this though.
---
I asked one of the community managers the other day and just got a “they’re working on finding solutions to implement a higher stash without impacting server stability”. 
---
When I asked for more transparency and a less vague answer they pretty much responded with the same thing... 
---
Nope, that's why post histories exist, you can tell who is and who isn't.
---
You aren’t wrong. The hotfix fixed Bobby pins. Then game is still utterly broke since last patch. who gives a fuck about Bobby pins.
---
Oh. My. God. Mind blown. I tip my hat to you, sir.
---
Like Whitesprings?
---
Why would the questline send a low level player into the spot where high level players are camped out 24/7?
---
I started during the beta before everything got nerfed and before there were servers full of 100+ players running around.
---
The game doesn't even tell you......hey don't fight off those 20 level 68 super mutants, that's not actually part of the questline.
---
Cool clickbait bro. Also if you don't like others opinions keep yours to yourself. 
---
How about you shut the fuck up instead... who are you to tell others not to post about? 
---
Deflate your head a bit it’s massive.
---
I mean, I think it’s a little (ok, a lot) different. 
---
Many of the streamers shat on the game and covering exploits while fully admitting they no longer played the game or did the exploits. There was the whole fiasco about the guy claiming to be in contact with 3 players who were banned for nothing and he posted his YouTube video as “Bethesda banning players for using 3rd party mods”. Later it was revealed that players were using memory editors such as cheat engine and that is why they were banned. 
---
It’s possible for Bethesda to fuck up this game while also you tubers are stirring the pot and just posting clear clickbait. The two don’t have to be mutually exclusive. 
---
Another "exploit."
---
Regardless of the engine and reused code - there's a ton of dev work, design work, marketing work, management work etc, involved in this game. 
---
I highly doubt it's profitable off of pre sales, and I don't think you give the "average" consumer enough credit. 
---
"If you love it, the world hates it"
---
I took out a level 91 deathclaw in about 15 seconds with a player crafted handmade.   Does not even have TSE.
---
Used maybe 30 bullets.
---
The Brahmin comment is funny, but the rest is an exaggeration.
---
I'm sorry you are having this problem. You are not alone.  However, I one-shot most things as high as level 68 with either my non-TSE shotgun or my fist weapon. If it takes 3 shells I get annoyed.
---
Totally agree. I am a casual gamer and get to play for a couple of hours a night if I’m lucky. I can understand people’s frustrations but personally don’t think I’ll get to the point where I’m creating specific builds across multiple characters. Hell, I just pick perks that negate whatever problem I’m suffering at the time, whether it’s carry weight, doing more damage, taking less damage, decreasing radiation etc. I think that a lot of the issues Bethesda have patched are the ones that effect me like game crashes, issues with carry weight and mission bugs, and as a whole thoroughly enjoy the game. 
---
I’m of the general opinion that we just expect so much from games these days. I can’t name many games where I think the intention is for players to play for hundreds upon hundreds of hours, and the expectation that a game like FO76 will remain novel, challenging and engaging for this amount of time is unrealistic and unattainable. 
---
It would be nice if Bethesda could address the issues that hardcore and casual gamers are experiencing, but agree that the fixes they have implemented are keeping the game a great experience for the majority. 
---
I see the nerf has really added significant balance to the game.

4. Game CTDs on load before hitting any Splash Screen whenever I have it set to Fullscreen.
---
5. N/A
---
yeah Rad-x has always suppressed
---
Charleston eh? Thats a good place for a camp close to two workshops.
---
That's how it fucking works here.
---
Gosh darn. I tried. :(
---
Sorry, they're focused on extending game-play (aka grinding) so they don't have to add new content.
---
I havent had that happen, but once and a while certain items would kick me from a server
---
&gt;Does Not mean melee is OP
---
how can you say that with a straight face? ranged is struggling to break 1K after the patch.
---
&gt;You have to take in to account the fact he is proccing multiple perks on top of his armor to be able to do that damage
---
so what? that's what "build" means. literally everything proccs "multiple perks"
---
&gt;If you reverse his build (which I have) in to a ranged build the damage becomes insane as well
---
factually wrong because ranged doesn't scale with strength. melee does. yes, bloodied is op, it's the same as two-shot prior to the nerf. but it'll never be able to hit for 17K willy nilly. not anymore.
---
&gt;But never the less in order for his build to work you are 1-3 hits from dying at any given time
---
there are ways to mitigate that. you really didn't know? you should rethink making a video "guide" because you're clearly not versed well enough into the game.
---
Minecraft?
---
HAHAHAHA
---
You dont even need to go fishing to catch them, they just sorta show up and crawl on to your plate. 
---
I think you give them too much credit. 
---
There’s something broken with addictions rn.
---
What I have learned is the sense of narcissism and inflated ego are quite strong here "in the community".
---
That happened to me a while back, though for me it wasnt an empty frame, it was a T45 that turned into a copy of my Ultracite.
---
I am a casual player who quit after 30 hours.  I do not enjoy playing 76.  I have enjoyed every other fallout game, even tactics.  I find the game boring and aggravating.  Nearly every change from fallout 4 is detrimental IMO.  I have found the patches to be clumsy at best, changing gameplay by fixing one thing and breaking or lessening another.  I have gone so far as to look at changelogs for the newer patches to see what folks are complaining about.  These Patches are shamefully poor.  I am sick of this game and abandoning it until something really changes.  I wish i could get my $20 refunded to put my money towards something worth paying for
---
Lmfao schooled. Been trying to tell people so much that melee isn’t op, they just aren’t making their builds right. Everyone was using TSE so it didn’t matter what BUILD you were going with you never focused on a primary weapon type. Now TSE is gone nobody knows how to adapt into a primary weapon type build. This is an RPG, the intent is to have one main focus. The noobs for their fun ruined and now melee is instantly OP because their 1hko build doesn’t work anymore.
---
They have a nice glass roundish cabinet already.  Would be nice if putting stuff in that container would make them display in the glass windows it already has.
---
Iirc when you finish each of the steps for the gear you learn the plans for all the equipment minus the shawl, try checking your crafting stations to see if you can build them
---
You already know tons of people will preorder the next elder scrolls and nothing will change.
---
Bioshock gave the remasters away for free. Most companies do. 
---
Armor effects not counting is a purposeful dynamic of the game. It brings one to deciding between legendary armor effects, or PA beefiness.
---
So since the nerf really didn't balance pvp at all can we please get a damage cap so people aren't constantly one shotted? Its should take at least 2 to 4 shots with the strongest weapon up close. Its more fun when it lasts. 
---
Maybe if you could have a hatch on the ground that goes into an instance shelter....
---
a ... instances.... fallout... shelter.....
---
In theory quality control can just be maintaining a certain level of shiftiness going forward. 
---
It looks like with each patch Bethesda is intent of breaking more things, which is highly impressive. 
---
I'm on XB1 and the game is still freezes and crashes for me after playing for exactly one hour. Never fails. Happened before the latest patch and clearing the cache does nothing. 
---
/u/Ladydevann and /u/LoneVaultWanderer    more reports of the corps disappearing issue. 
---
I would like to add the below as well:
---
#Kill a Mob and they disappear or become unlootable:
---
* It falls with ragdoll mechanics, and poof just gone, no meat pile nothing but you do see the blood from the fight.
---
* As it falls you see an inventory on the mob to be looted.  Hits the ground the corpse has no form of interaction.  i.e. no swirling arrows, nothing just like its a non lootable prop in the world.  (yeah I know, loot faster /s)
---
#The new Caps Stash.
---
   I looted 2 on the first day of patch using normal loot and the mechanic for getting the extra loot.   The stash item remained like a container.  
---
Next time I went by the area, there was no container. They have yet to re-spawn.  I am talking about the one that is above the Enclave bunker and the one behind the locked door in Whitesprings.  The stash just does not appear.   I thought I understood they would be a daily lootable item in the world.  Cant loot it if it doesn't exist.
---
Please let me know if I just misunderstand the new mechanic, or if there is actually an issue.
---
Other things not listed in the patch notes:
---
* Mothman eggs, are only lootable once per day.
---
* Harvesting wood from fallen trees is only once per day.
---
* I haven't tried, but I am assuming that mining is only once per day now as well.
---
The point of the criticism from the people on this sub is not to ruin someone's fun.  FO76 might be a meme on most of the internet at this point, but that's not why most of us are here.  We are critical because we also love the game, or at least we love what it should/could be.  We want to see improvements to both the game itself and the way it is being handled. 
---
Shutting the fuck up does not help anyone. We should be critical when it's shit and we should be full of praise when its not.  
---
Depends on how fast you do it and how long before you start the event 
---
I need the original rewards to upgrade them. I haven’t seen a way to craft the original quest rewards.
---
I hate bethesda 
---
Its happening with items that I got bigger ammounts really. I do remember getting kicked from servers before but didn't have the issue lately.
---
Would it not make more sense that the tremendous stacking beyond the weight limit had something to do with it?
---
apparently you never learned grammar or spelling though 
---
Well if you have something like 27361826 weight you'll need to get that down to about 1700-2000 to put anything else in your inventory
---
Even on ebay it gets bid up much higher than that, like 15 dollar minimum still.
---
Yeah I'm beginging to think they think the key to success in this game is forcing is to do more for less AKA grinding
---
Sounds like real life.
---
There’s a difference between fixing a bug and introducing a new one which is unforeseen. 
---
The real problem is it looks like they fucked up something as basic as version control with the latest issue with Bobby pins. 
---
Indeed, I know I found them incredibly helpful, not for the mods, but to build a new one when hitting the level marker or when accidentally scrapping one. 
---
Real casual with the ethnic slur, gotta love the Silent Generation.
---
People who carried around a plethora of stuff on them because stash sizes are limited and traders are capped at 200 caps now have a limit on the amount they can carry. (And no, it's not just duppers who did that.) Changing how some weapons worked by adjusting their damages, Changing how certain perk cards work, changing weapon degradation rates, increasing some of the diseases verious effects. Need I go on?
---
Got you bud. I’ll let you know how it is. If you have access to YouTube. I’ll live stream my group playing. 
---
This is what I would expect with the nerfs, but still there are people who claim that its still going the other way -- Queen dead in a few seconds, from ranged weapons.
---
Truth? Bug? Exploit? Hack? Who the hell knows?
---
Can u please overthink the "fix" to the Critical shot because it highly nerfed every crit build. The Build where to strong and needa nerf but when you max your crit build and now just ~ 1/10 shots is a Critical when it used to be 10/10 for some people it would be completly pointless to focus your build on them since they dont work properly
---
I've only ever fought one (timer ran out when she had about 1/4 health left. About 6 players including me with some at a high level) and have already decided that it's not worth the ammo or effort in the future. 
---
Yep, anything other than aluminum and lead you should not bulk. 
---
I would look at it a little different, using his analogy:
---
* I go into a restaurant and order a NY Strip (well done) with mashed potatoes and string beans.  As a bonus the menu says you get a small appetizer to start. 
---
* I get the appetizer, but find out I have limited time to eat it, but that's fine - the bigger issue is I tell them there are some things wrong with the appetizer, and the waiter says he'll bring it to the chefs. 
---
* My meal comes out, but the steak is raw, the potatoes are undercooked, and the string beans aren't seasoned.  I tell the waiter, who says they will bring me a replacement.
---
* A few minutes later, the waiter comes back out with another plate saying the cooked string beans will be coming out on another plate.  But now the potatoes are cooked, but the steak is still only medium (The string beans aren't done, but I knew that)  I again complain, and the waiter says he'll bring it back to the chefs.  
---
* When the waiter returns again, now the stringbeans are cooked, but some how the steak is back to raw and the potatoes are undercooked again.  
---
This transaction would be unacceptable.  Yes, Bethesda is giving us the "NY Strip" they advertised (and we got the BETA they advertised as an appetizer), but it keeps coming out wrong.  We keep trying to tell them, sending the waiter back with information but either they don't know how to make it right, or simply don't care. 
---
For many people, they gave up at the first bullet point, dropping out when they could cancel their order during BETA.  
---
I've had to jump a few servers till i got Marsupial working. Then i noticed i wasnt getting bonus from twisted muscles. One time i got full benefits from all mutations as if i had strange in numbers on, but i don't even have the card and i wasn't a in a party.. lol 
---
Since most of their vaults succeeded at their designated tasks, fucking smartarse. 
---
Collecting worthless virtual goods with no tangible or material value sounds like a shitty "hobby". 
---
Only lead and aluminium bulking saves space (50% space)
---
Competition is not limited to games, people will compare eachother with everything. It's human nature. Acting like you're exempt of doing it is simply false. We all do it at some point**s** in our lives. Get on with it. Toxic competion is bad though i'll give you that. But comparing yourself to someone else for the sake of doing it is fine.
---
If I remember correctly, it's still only 10/hr but all six pull from that pool of 10/hr. 
---
It's -30 outside, no. 
---
Steaming fix. 
---
As in it’s likely a steaming pile of shitcode 
---
Also on PS4 and I could come with a even more problems. A lot more.
---
I just stopped playing.
---
I've two manned the Queen before, so 8 is a little high.  Check the server you are on and if you see several high level players (70+), drop that nuke, you'll have backup.
---
We're going to win the Super Bowl in 2107!!! You just wait...
---
Then find another way to have fun? I’m having fun building my camp right now, looking through places, roleplaying, meeting new people, and finding more holotape stories. 
---
Once I’ve had my fun I’ll put down my controller and do something else. This games a buggy fuckin mess, every Bethesda game to date has been ridden with bugs. This one’s no different, but I’ve got a little more patience when I consider that it’s been done by a team of people who barely have 1 and a half games under their belt as a company. It sucks that they had to break new ground with a game that could’ve been a lot more, but in the end, some people have found themselves their own light in the darkness.  
---
Yeah, the games development is rocky. But I choose to support it because I like it, and you don’t want to support it anymore. That’s fine by me. 
---
Also yes, of course I came here to act like a cockhead towards you, your arguments are hilarious! If you were any of the dozens of other idiots bitching about nerfs i would’ve just scrolled along, but your statements? Saying that I have 0 validity because I’ve been a responder for 11 days, that you’ve played the game for 2000 hours (sorry mr epic gamer, it’s “probably only half that”, even though in your initial post you definitely do back that claim up), calling me “kiddo”, saying the game is fundamentally broken, that shit isn’t even working as it’s intended to, that literal leagues of people ran away because of the deplorable pingate incident, etc. Your arguments have no real logic behind them, they’re empty opinions by one (I’m assuming) fat neckbeard who thinks being right on the internet can only be achieved if you’ve a reddit account as old as time and ending your responses with “kiddo”.
---
Except you can't account for all the people who bought (or were gifted) the game and refunded/returned/ recycled it - or have just given up playing it.  
---
Sales don't equal players, especially after 2.5 months of shitty performance and bugs and mediocre patches.
---
There is absolutely no way to have any definitive understanding of how many people are current players.  
---
Any inferences you wish to make from your percentage calculation are just smoke.
---
Cheapest you can get it on ebay for buy it now is 11 dollars after shipping, and that's with all this shit going on right now.  
---
But go ahead and just spew nonsense like everyone else here without doing research. Reddit is fun.
---
I just kill toads for it, they typically have 2-4 bio fluids in them
---
That trending post about a "new perspective" smells like bethesda shady stuff again. It already has 2k upvotes. They're trying to convince the community that there is still a large public defending the game.
---
The PS4 freezing glitch has been getting me since 2 patches ago.  If it just now started hitting you, then that possibly means it’s tied to an item or something else in game.   That’s going to be hard for them to research and fix.
---
I haven't played in almost a month. I've just been reading in horror as it further declines. I hung in there... until I was playing with my girlfriend and I either couldnt see her character, her characters armor appeared invisible, or she appeared as a man... armor still invisible. Tried to re log and it wouldn't let me back in. 
---
Somebody who shouldn’t have bought an MMO styled game.
---
&gt;Most companies do. 
---
Gunna need a source on that, everything I've found suggests most companies don't.
---
Simply being able to hide some would be a huge improvement.
---
serendipity is the strangest perk card.  i have level 3 of it and it only ever triggers after i have died and respawned.  then it will trigger repeatedly.  i think it doesn't work right.
---
Lmao you have nothing to say that’s not based on assumptions .... umm Melee is oooooo ppppp 
---
Don't be a hater hater.
---
Yes but to craft the weapons you need said weapon to use in the recipe for some reason like to make the voice of set the recipe says you need the voice of set but I don’t have it because I scraped it so now I can’t make it
---
I already opened a ticket before making this post.
---
We know. You're about 12hrs late with the story already posted here
---
"*look at my new cliffside base OwO*"
---
Heavy weapon damage doesn't follow real world rules so why should pistols?
---
&gt;People who own the game but stopped playing are still invested in it,
---
Why don't you just whisper that sweet nothing into the ear of 95% of my steam library, it will make a lot if lonely games happy.
---
Should just call it a mistake XD
---
melee can hit for 17K without even trying. that's the very definition of op.
---
Until it's fixed - this. 
---
Go in third person, sneak, and pull out your weapon until everything loads. 
---
Also, you aren't waiting long enough. After opening the pip-boy and it freezes you in place, it WILL correct itself if you wait. No leaving the server or restarting the game needed. This has worked for me 100% of the time. 
---
This board or Twitter or pretty much everywhere. Really seems like people hate it. I just think a lot of the people who hate it haven't actually played it.
---
I asked one guy on Twitter who was bashing it if he's played it and got a "Don't have to. Metacritic reviews speak for themselves". 🙄
---
last night i died and it triggered five times in a row after i had respawned. 
---
Correct, and the life bonus requires *unique* outfits, so the garb only gives +15 bonus, even if the whole team wears it. To get anything over +15 up to the maximum+60, you *must* spend money.
---
It's not a massive bonus, but it is *exclusively* for real money items. It's a dangerous precedent.
---
Well I aint lying, so someone's doing something very different than the 30 or 40 people I played during the last 5 attempts then :-)
---
Yeah no, that's not the case. Your assumption really hits far away from reality. There's something that ressembles a usefull comment, only took 6 tries! Still salty though, but can't ask for too much can we? Still doesn't merit a response thought. 
---
One out of a required 4 unique outfits for maximum bonus
---
Ive been stating this past few days but mine kept getting down voted 🤣 props to you! 
---
It's sad there are just so many!!!
---
Back in my day games released were a finished product. Kids like yourself wouldn't know that I guess.
---
The best is when you fast travel to one and the event has completely vanished. 
---
Here here. It makes those posts here about what people want to see all the more painful, because people here have amazing ideas. Ideas that Bethesda really doesn't care about. They have a roadmap, they have a set list of DLC they're going to release, and a set list of features they already made up they're minds on adding long ago. And they're not going to deviate from it, unfortunately.
---
It is very marginal, but it's also a shitty precedent doing something they already said very clearly they wouldn't do.
---
And then there's me on PC who has had to reinstall the game because it crashed so hard it nuked itself.
---
rdr2 was pretty underwhelming for me.. I quit after 25-30 hours. It looks really nice though
---
Yeah, maybe special location like Fissure Site Prime would be exent of the no fast travel thing. We'd have to remember to suit up before travelling though :)
---
# Here are some major bugs I've noticed on PS4:
---
* [The 'doorway to Narnia' inside of the Whitespring Golf Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWIn-n74LBI)
---
* [On PS4, major login issues every single damn time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xlQylY1lpk). Notice how I can't see/use my gun, and the sound occurs for my pipboy, but I can't see it. [Here's another video where my gun is majorly effed up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ2-MOKt_lk)
---
* [Enemies often disappear or 'teleport' all over the place. I constantly have enemies disappear in front of my eyes, or appear out of thin air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-4WlBhMLg)
---
* [Several bugs in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jvYk8spE2Y) Sneaking doesn't work at all half the time! I have all possible perk points into sneak, and leather armor with shadowed/muffled, and enemies can sense me through walls and all come to my location.. How is that possible ????? Also, enemies are frozen in a T-shape like they're crucified on a cross
---
* [Godrays coming through the mountains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO7APDxyUeU)
---
Lmao...looking at your attempt for a sentence.
---
Yes! Too much reddit popular opinions and not enough real players. A few thousand doesn't represent the 1.4 million copies sold 🤣
---
Same here, I died and after the respawn it trigger multiple times! So annoying xD
---
But sometimes i avoid damages, and it doesnt show up! Maybe just the trigger animation is bugged? 
---
Hi, I'm a bot (in Beta). I combined your list of YouTube videos into one shareable highlight reel link:  https://app.hivevideo.io/view/328aff
---
 You can play through the whole highlight reel (with timestamps if they were in the links), or select each video.
---
 Reply with the word ignore and I won't reply to your comments.
---
Every article about this credits reddit as a source it may be true but it seems fishy then again if it's on the internet it must be true
---
Yeah I oversimplified it, sorry for my wording.
---
Of course I compare my stuff too, how could I know if I can reach for some better stuff if not? :)
---
*Subjectively
---
Oh wasn’t aware of that, I think you’ll need the shawl then cause I believe the fabricator can remake the base weapons
---
This game is far from finished. They may have some good ideas for how to take it further, but so far we haven't seen any of it yet. I don't think that Bethesda dedicated enough staff to support this game. It feels like a side project that needs more loving.
---
/u/Ladydevann can you pass this on to the dev team? Not sure if they are aware.
---
Have you tried going back to the fabricator?
---
I dropped mine as they didn’t help me much, but I’ve always wondered if you could go back. 
---
You not liking the same things as me doesn't make me like them any less - or make my opinions any less valid.  I got more than my money's worth for 60$ and am enjoying the game.  You asked for reasons other than "The glitches aren't that bad" - and I gave you a long list of reasons why I love the game.  
---
As for your invitation to enter into a discussion about the minutea of patch details and other unrelated topics - I'm going to respecfully decline.  I either haven't witnessed any of the issues first hand, heard anything other than anecdotal evidence to support them, or am not bothered by them due to a belief that they are a temporary problem.
---
That being said I hope they improve the game to a point where it meets your standards - as it has already met mine.
---
Lolz think of it as a metaphor, like fame or fortune.
---
Always within grasp, but always fleeting..
---
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
---
Don't dupe next time?
---
Tragic and embarrassing are the words...
---
They were complaining about auto scrap not happening when crafting. Eg. People bulk lead because it halves the weight, after the recent patch, one had to go and get the bulk out of stash, go to a bench and manually scrap it, and then craft ammo. Tedious. Previously, it would unbulk when crafting as needed, automatically. The issue was likely associated with the auto scrap of mods (like rare calibrated/jetpack) fix. Anyway, I assume the hotfix fixed this.
---
Ironic.
---
I’m gonna try it later on today, but I don’t have the mask so I dunno if the door will open
---
That could work too, I can imagine the power stations getting crowded by people reaching nearby nuke zones, sounds fun.
---
Something is funky with the Bunker Buster missile launcher as well. Damage with full Demo Expert is 254 and normal missile launchers are the same. Without demo expert the BB is 161 and normals are 150. That 20% bonus damage it supposedly get seems...inaccurate.
---
My money is on going Free To Play
---
Does anyone get anything from mobs that get mowed down by turrets, anyway? If I understand correctly, the owner has to personally tag every enemy they want to loot, and in my experience turrets don't farm XP for me, either, if I'm not tagging.
---
technically the graphics are nothing impressive and the development has been nothing short of a joke. that's not an opinion.
---
Its amazing how many bugs get thru with these patches
---
I took her down yesterday in 1:26. It was me, 2 melee friends, a shotgun build, and someone else. Pretty easy
---
Seems replicatable. On PS4 at least, if you are sneaking outside a spawned group of enemies' "activation range" for too long without "activating" the enemies, they will all just die. I think it's to make room for a new spawn. For example, swapping out Scorched for Super Mutants.
---
When I say "activate", I mean that most enemies seem to spawn in a frozen state, and will not start doong anything until you get close to them. 
---
Once all the one time challenges are complete, those atoms *do* become a grind. Also, if they're doing this weekly, is it sustainable? No.
---
It's shit that they're doing something they said they wouldn't and aren't receiving more flak for it. Games with any paid advantage over non-paid are fine if they're clearly stated as such from the beginning and, in my opinion, free to play due to the monetization model.
---
Already played BL2 a ton, it was excellent. :)
---
It’s 25 caps after patch
---
Upvoted. I'm like isn't that what people wanted? So it could be used for item creation.
---
I worry only children are left in this /r, that and people who paid lots of caps or really money for TSE and whine about it now.
---
Do you always respond to subs of games you don’t follow?
---
Why would anyone want more than 60 fps. There are numerous articles proving 99%of humans cant see more than 60. If millions play ganes on consoles everyday at 60 why do you need 500 fps?
---
It's odd for sure. Mine triggered after I got a bounty destroying a camp with turrets at Whitespring, and wouldn't turn off for the rest of my play through. Bullets just weren't hitting me. Note that I didn't have the card equipped or was I in a team for someone to share it with me. It triggered 9 out of 10 shots fired at me. After I came back home a few hours later and logged back on again, I started getting lucky break popping up lol. My Armor is in tip top shape now!
---
If they gave us some new content (or fixed some of the stuff I mentioned) players may be diatracted enough to ignore all the bugs. But what do we know we are just trying to find ways to enjoy a game.
---
Sort by weight gg, the heavy stuff will float to the top GG. cosmetic stuff is usually 0.1 weight. 
---
Sometimes the queen gives you a drill or a flare gun, in that case you wont get a legendary item. These "weapons" are in the queens loot table for legendaries, but cant spawn with legendary effects.
---
It says collected right? 
---
They really need to figure something out to fix this. I shouldn't have to edit my INI just to kite the SBQ back into the border regions of the map
---
Iv'e solo'd the entire game (level 114 150+ hours), and it seems that I have the same play style as you. I'm not following "builds" and not grinding stuff out 24/7. I have shit to do during the day, and can only put a few hours in. The only things I have not done, are to launch a nuke ( can  accomplish this solo), and kill the Queen (need a group). 
---
Don't think you can remove it. It's a new effect that was added in 76 to most objects in the game when light touches them.
---
Everyone can dupe too, I guess doing that isn't an unfair advantage?  You can rationalize it all you want, doing it is still cheating.
---
The quality of the game, whether you think its not good or the best game ever, independent of production decisions and graphical quality, are subjective opinions, not objective ones.
---
Got this bug after the Hotfix on Xbox. 
---
No memories please 
---
Oh great! Let’s drop nukes in a pointless area and see folks die!
---
I don’t think is the Same lol 
---
I always flock to the Nuke site if one goes off- of my last 4 times, 2x we killed her, 1x I blue screened (of course that was my nuke too), and 1x we couldn’t kill her- seems (like most are saying) too many people makes it exponentially harder to kill her-
---
&gt;level 1
---
Well an upvote. I think the TSE brigade got you. Only Anit-76 posts allowed.
---
That one is weird because I have the same situation except my Int didn’t change between crafting either leg. A number of PAs have this, not just Excavator. I am unsure if it’s a display bug or their actual durability is different by mistake. It’s not really possible to test in game due to the uneven way damage hits armor durability (we tend to put our left arms and legs forward, so these armor pieces get damaged faster).
---
Truthfully I prefer red dead fishing 
---
All good.
---
That's me, I got my 100 hours and tons of enjoyment, now I lurk around here reading stories and waiting for whenever they drop content.  I'm excited af for vaults to start opening.
---
Happened to me too, but then I found out that rad x suppresses mutation effects. I didn’t know that. Now I do. 
---
Bethesda: No, but here is some half assed pvp... :P
---
I actually got this coat earlier this week, can post a SS if there is still interest in it... FYI I dropped during It's a Trap event.
---
I feel bad for the ppl w 15 charisma and only being able to share one perk card still. 
---
Another stealth nerf to increase grind, or unintentional bug. Either way things are beyond ridiculous at this point. 
---
Bethesda: That sucks, here is some pvp...
---
Played the hell out of it, it’s amazing and my favorite gameplay ever. I had to quit though, the menu changes screwed everything up cause I’m bug on muscle memory and the new style is too inconsistent to swiftly navigate menus. It’s like nails on a chalkboard to me, an hour of playing with those menus makes me quit for another week or two. So I just don’t.
---
Yeah, no point except for vendoring. A lad did a spreadsheet saying it was marginally better, then it was pointed out he didn't count in the plastic usage so it debunked it. Waste of time and effort bulking
---
I’m guessing it’s like super duper. It works but the animation is screwy and lags behind
---
Probably a bloated number. If someone is on PS4 and they enter Rest Mode with a game launched, it counts every hour. Someone could also easily just keep the game up on their computer while they sleep. 
---
This is how I managed to log almost 4000 hours on my PS4 last year. (Sony released a link showing your game stats)
---
I think the clearly huge disparity between peoples experiences in this quest is the real problem, clearly the damage/player to health algorithm they use is fucked... 
---
I have to follow or play sir?
---
Is it all your items (except ammo)?  It only seems like the first item on list for me?  Kinda sucks because it's aluminum and can't transfer it from mule to crafting character.
---
Me too. I use a buzz blade and those are only really good if they’re in pristine condition.
---
Thank you for the most insightful and information filled answer. This is exactly what I need to answer my query in it's fullest.
---
I replied to a comment and it disappeared smh
---
The problem is if low level players show up, they drastically buff her health, without putting anything into killing her. Their damage barely scratches her
---
It is where it is placed. it is outside the golf shop at WS it will continually kill ghouls that other players farm. The owner gets no benefit unless he actual hits the ghoul himself but with that many turrets the ghouls die so fast nobody can get xp or loot.
---
This is considered by most to be a griefers platform and will be nuked my many players on sight.
---
I mean they would probably be launched at whitespring and fissure prime anyway though
---
It's junk im specifically trying to get
---
I’d like to see Bethesda’s analysis
---
Only in your inventory, though. Chassis in your Stash don’t have the atom.
---
I've never had it happen on a door, but happens to wooden shutter walls all the time at my CAMP.
---
Ya. This has been a problem for over a month now. You just have to wait a minute for the game world to load fully.
---
not at all. even if you're not versed in game development, we have better examples to compare it to. games with higher polygon count, better quality textures, more advanced post-processing. again, facts.
---
art direction is subjective- to an extent. and \*I\* think the game is pretty. that's an opinion. and it doesn't change the facts.
---
same on the PR front. nightmare after nightmare. both inside and outside the game. indie companies manage better.
---
Never heard of that, and never noticed that myself. Item durability has a base value determined only by what item it is, and attached mods modify that. Some mods increase it a lot! All my guns use Forceful/Precise Stocks if they can use one.
---
Xbox one
---
Flavors of mayhem quest still broken. Quest objective is talk to rose. I do, she just says “oh, you’re back” and nothing else. 
---
First aid perk not working for diluted stimpacks. 
---
You are correct on the not liking them,  just don't try to claim it is far superior and different from FO4.  Most of those were just facts,  like the combat. The patch details and the "unrelated topics"  are important since it shows what the company values and direction they are taking.  It is important for future and current purchases. You are also missing the major point,  both sides have extreme and unrealistic opinions but the fact remains that the players shape the game.  If they are not happy they will leave,  if 76 can't support it self with cash items for the server.  It will shut down especially for a large company  , and last I checked there is no offline play.
---
They could just make it so when you pick it up “power armor chassi number 4” and then the next “power armor chassi number 5” and so on
---
Yeah, flipping sweet outfits. I've been waiting for the shroud, but they hit me with that, grognak, the inspector, and an unstoppable stash box and bed? Shut up and take my atoms
---
So, let me get this straight:
---
You bought a game three months ago.
---
Now you want to go rob random employees to get your money back?
---
Am I following this correctly? 
---
The obvious difference is that Bethesda have made it clear that they consider duping to be an exploit by them.  Your *opinion* is noted, however, muling is not cheating.
---
I had this happen to me once. I logged out and back in, and I suddenly had 3 blueprints that weren't there before. Each one was a different level of my house. 
---
Thanks for the further updates. I made some comments on the video and the youtuber replied. They stated that after patch they took a pretty big hit in the overall effectiveness. Stated it takes a lot more hits to kill SQB. I thought about attempting the build build with a TSE Handmande or Bloody Handmade. I'm really hoping that some minor tweaks will happen with Demo perk to allow a wee bit more DPS lol. 
---
time to make an ALT bunker buster. Demo expert maxed, Fatman with some orbital strikes and Zero caps on him.
---
Just leave him at WS and call him out for these special occasions.
---
What game series have you been playing? There  are tons of vaults that failed miserably.
---
All I do at this point is fight the queen and trade with players. I can't remember the last time it took longer than 10 minutes to kill her. It's usually 4-8 minutes regardless of player count
---
I’m on PS4.
---
Development cycles have ups and downs, it won't be perfect just the way you like it. This aint burger king. No one needs you to list a hundred reasons why you think they are incompetent, they are doing just fine and this game will continue to be updated.
---
“Away from Keyboard “. AFK basically means that the player has walked away from their keyboard/controller for some reason. 
---
Could be something simple like a quick run to the bathroom, or went to get a drink/snack from the kitchen. Could also be something complex like a important call from work, or they needed to help their child with something.
---
It all boils down to the same thing: the player is not at their keyboard/controller, and can’t react to anything in game.
---
Actually forgot to mention that Im only in Reddit because of fo76
---
Can you record that and post it here? I would love to see that honestly 
---
Old news. Way to stay up to date, though. 
---
When I used to farm whitesprings for legendaries I used to drop all the crap one in a bag on the door step of the club house and throw a Molotov on it. Then some scavenger would come up and grab em all. 
---
The whole comedy of the preservation shelters is that they don't work.
---
Hah school is where I'm coming from too. But I teach. College. Ah, video games, bringing students and teachers together!
---
I can't wait for private servers and mods. I would love 76 tenfold if it was a 4 player co-op game 
---
Yeah, there's a bunch of changes that seem like they'd affect casual players like those increased cost for repair and increased prices. Nobody wants that, and it's gonna be worse for more casual players
---
There's something more infuriating: Disconnecting as you see it die and fall from the sky
---
Also sign me up for all those alternate missile types! Especially that Black Titanium tipped anti-SB missile. Targetting Computers were meant to make our launchers SAMs, so lets get some missiles that can actually ground those bat bastards!
---
PC version (Aus which works in USA) has been under $10 on CD over the last couple weeks, not sure if its still there now, but
---
I don't think it leans toward the latter. This sub has 175k subscribers and only 3k upvote the hate posts. I think most just enjoy the game and are happy to get updates fixing 30 issues even if it reintroduces 3.
---
I have Barbarian, Ironclad and Evasive on max as Def Perks. Scaly Skin Mutation and some Vanguard Armor Pieces for some extra Def. 
---
And with the skill Blocker, ur almost invicible since most enemies are melee based. Even in Nuke Zones i always run around with the Hazmat Suit.
---
I like how you misspelled both Kurt and Cobain lol
---
Or at least let us name them.
---
Jokes on them, I get my brother to remove my bounty 
---
No dude. Never. For any game in existence. PC is the GOAT 100% of the time. Why would you ask this?
---
Not sure what that proves, other than my point... :-)
---
I like the idea to aggro a SB and then hide in the base. Let the SB do the work and sit back and watch.
---
Vault techs expirament to see what it takes for people to quit a game
---
That's a weird thing to be infuriated about.
---
Killer clowns from outerspace reference?
---
&gt;the game is objectively not good 
---
That was what you said.  Not everyone cares about the dev stuff.  "Not Good" is a nebulous term, with no defining metric.  
---
I'm not calling into question the quality of the game one way or the other.  I am simply stating that your use of objective in this case is not correct.
---
Sneak really helps. Doubles damage too. Try equipping a silencer and play stealthily until you can get some more levels.
---
Haven’t gotten no legendary loot from her but it has always been terrible.
---
I have the perk that increases how much thirst you recover from drinks by 25% and i have been convinced that it has not worked since beta. I dehydrate what seems like 4 times as fast compared to eating. 
---
I have too many survival games, Ark, Pixark, Grav, Dayz, etc. I still hear day z is getting worked on which is a fucking joke in itself, but 76 is still new so I'll give it a year
---
*Seriously guys?*
---
\- A Browns Fan
---
I didn't see it posted anywhere. Good looking out
---
Ok kiddo
---
*Sorts by controversial*
---
Pack a 2h melee, and roll the Horde events for legendary guns.
---
I don't know what to say. you're wrong, simple as that. your whole post is just fanboy wanking.
---
this isn't a case of "oops, sorry, we messed this little thing up", the whole game is crooked. and this isn't a small, indie dev either. I can't think of a worse mess up in recent times. I don't think even NMS was this bad.
---
Fo76 is doing anything but fine. who in their right mind would think this dumpster fire is "fine"? it's simply not possible.
---
The bounty system should scale to crimes but right now it’s one flat rate for most things - 10 caps, picking a lock is 5.  Terrible system - they should change it and then Your suggestion would make a lot more sense.
---
I agree, no weapon should be unaffected by perks. Grenade launchers got “untyped” as well by a patch and it’s annoying as hell.
---
Also I think it’d be great to clarify for Bethesda: do Railway spikes count for Bandolier properly? They’re so heavy, so they really should.
---
Yes but might need 2 for all those turrets 😁
---
Very often the enemy names get messed up I noticed, non legendary named enemies drop legendary loot while the legendary named enemies drop normal loot. 
---
TThis definitely took time yes.
---
But then he decided to be a dick by doing th following:
---
1.placed it in a popular, laggy location
---
2. Added a fuckton of turrets where any number over 12 shooting at the same target causes lag
---
I’m all supportive of those people who made fortresses and DONT lag the server or put it in jerk locations like this. Fuck this guy
---
Make sure to fix tbe bobby pin weight but totally bugger up auto scrapping bulk items.  Hmm I wonder what’s the bigger issue? JFC! 
---
TSE is "Two shot explosive". That's two legendary affixes for weapons: 
---
* Two shot added 100% damage. 
---
* Explosive added 100% damage, added an area of effect (potentially killing the user), and allowed use of the formerly powerful demolitions expert perk (explosives). 
---
Weapons with both modifiers made a mockery of every enemy except the Scorch Beast Queen (SBQ).  
---
Its a Rifle so I always assumed it was covered under the rifleman perks, i did not know this and i agree 100% with OP.
---
If you center your build around DPS vs the queen, you get really good at doing damage against the queen. If you center your build around weight reduction perks, you tend to do crap damage against the queen. I wouldn't say this particular part is broken, just that players are choosing builds that are easier to play outside of the queen. 
---
I thought I was hallucinating but yeah that’s a good point.  The food and water levels are not keeping up with past standards.  Oh well time to farm some more!!  
---
This. Is. Amazing. Great work! 
---
Weird how that sounds similar to Super Duper’s proc icon and sound playing at incorrect times. Maybe Serendipity is working and it’s just the proc indicators messing up? Have you noticed any times it definitely is preventing damage?
---
Get industrial water purifiers then get the carnivore muataion and cannibal perk
---
"Your Mother"
---
But you bought it anyway and play it still.
---
You are part of the problem for feeding the controversy. Each time you post negative comments 
---
folks curious are like, it can’t be that bad and buys it.. like a rubberneckers and car accidents.
---
If this whole experience was really a PITA to deal with, (support environment, and expectations)most mature folks woulda left and moved on, after seeing their demands unheard.
---
The folks with release issues, they’re the ones feeling bitter and angry, feel Bethesda owes them something more then what was delivered.  They will never be sated. It will always be something, and it will always be Bethesda’s fault.  Got passed over a promotion? Bethesda. Prom date ditched ya for someone else? Bethesda,  car broke down Because you were too busy playing Fallout 76, Bethesda..
---
Like the song says, let it go.. lolz
---
Lets not let these people ruin a good thing. 
---
I had my camp at WS pre lvl 50. It was convenient for grinding exp there. If i ever roll  a second character i want to be able to put my base there. 
---
I vote no sir. Let them have CAMP at WS
---
I know, I did the math too. But there is a bunch of people claiming they have played 600+ h so far (you can find them in the comments section) and complaining that the end end end end game is not existing, that there is nothing to do at level 180, there is a bug and Bethesda is not working on that.
---
Sometimes seem to me (even if it isn‘t true) the argument is: „I‘ve spent so much time with that game, so Bethesda is in charge to fix things for me or I will throw it away.“ 
---
Btw: I checked my statistics, stating that I‘ve played 81 hours. Next milestone is „Explore Appalachia for 7600 hours“. I mean...hahahaha.
---
I‘m lvl 45. And many people have 2-3 characters at 150+ already.
---
I would love if the "Quantum Nuke" was more of a quantum bomb where time and distance did not matter. you could have a hit scan fatman but the ammo would have to be very costly and rare. 
---
for example, you would need about 10-20 Nuka cola quantums and a couple of mini nukes to make it.
---
Anyone that defends this game is considered a fanboy, I don't care. I'm not saying this game is perfect, but they are doing a great job imo. Bethesda, crooked? You're talking out of your ass.
---
Games back then and games now can not really be compared. They where not close to the complexity that games have these days. 
---
Have been playing games since i got my C64 as a 12 year old. We had games with bugs back then aswell, if we where lucky we could work around the bug.
---
Op is by the way in his mid 30's if i recall correct.
---
Imagine someone raping your ass one day and the police officer says "How did people become so entitled and serious over anal fissures? Because it is hurts? Kick in the balls can be more painful than this. A broken jaw can be more painful than this. Some people lose their legs in wars."
---
Yet another one.  I have the 30% core usage perk and it’s like not working - at least not last night.  I wonder if their “hotfix” mucked things up as it seems like I am burning through cores and water and food way quicker.
---
&gt;Nothing that has transpired since the first couple weeks will ever change that value. Nothing will ever take away the fact that this is an excellent game.
---
I agree - nothing will change the fact that you enjoyed it. But not everyone does.
---
I know right? I'd build a mansion with rooms for everyone
---
Sure you can have fun. That doesn't make it a good game. I've had some great moments in this game, running from a scorchbeast and hiding in a cave from it only to realize the cave is a deathclaw nest and I am now trapped, good times. Have fun all you want, I will too but refusing to acknowledge the many faults this game has, and the hit or miss Bethesda patches does nothing to further bethesda's games in the future. Acting like this game is perfectly fine and is just as good as any other Bethesda title is how they will end up like EA. Just pumping out games with good trailers and not much else.
---
Again though, have fun, I still think it is. But, dont act like it's perfect. 
---
Solo is viable. Makes most of the charisma perks unneeded but hey, it is still fun
---
I played for like *maybe* 2 weeks. I honestly didn't encounter any game breaking bugs and whatnot, I just found the game boring. 
---
Meh. What a waste. 
---
You collected stacks of over 2k junk items? Super Duper.
---
You don't
---
hard to say.  most of my damage is melee type damage and can't tell if its being prevented or the enemy just missed.  i know when i die it usually triggers at least once in the period between respawning and actually having been respawned.  sometimes it will spam over and over.
---
it is. I don't care whether you care about "dev stuff", that's precisely what I was talking about. otherwise I wouldn't have said "objectively" in the first place.
---
BTW, the way consumers are being treated is amazing: heavy engagement in forums, reps collecting big reports, and hotfixes _the next day_ after recognizing mistakes? Fantastic.
---
Satisfied you must be happy go check division 2 beta trailers the simple has waymore content than this shit show
---
No it's not "necessary" But I mean when has necessity stopped people from overkill.  Is it necessary to put another 100 horse power of upgrades into a muscle car when it already hits the speed limit in 3 seconds? 
---
You can look at it from both ends..unless this setup causes the player to die more often than ususal, it shouldn't matter. More survivability isn't going to help any more than the excessive damage would in 95% of encounters.
---
Xbox does this too, here’s some stats:
---
57.28% haven’t reached level 10
---
77.63% haven’t reached level 25
---
89.79% haven’t reached level 50
---
98.22% haven’t reached level 100
---
So that would suggest the other 30 or 40 random players I was with over those 5 events also have the exact same issue.... nah, it's something else not levelling correctly. I have downed her quickly before , it has changed for sure... at least sometimes. Judging by all the confused emojis popping up I would think they also normally down her pretty quick..
---
Don't use turrets. They use up a minimum of 10% budget per turret. Some of the more advanced turrets use up to 15% per iirc.
---
&gt; Each time you post negative comments folks curious are like, it can’t be that bad and buys it.. like a rubberneckers and car accidents.
---
Yeah, I remember when a local restaurant gave everyone salmonella and people were like 'Nah, surely not' and went there. Oh wait.
---
This is quite possibly the stupidest interpretation of 'Any publicitiy is good publicity' I have ever seen. But I'm not surprised to find it here, where being slapped in the face is met with 'Please sir, may I have another?'
---
If your more than 1500 overweight you can't take on additional items (in patch notes), additionally another user reported if you have more than 2000 of same item in stash box you can't remove any (not in patch notes).  Not sure the circumstances of #2, but I would imagine if you had duped a rare uniform (like you have 2000+ Long Coats, etc?  
---
Not really the same thing though. The example in the image shown is extreme but we could have higher budgets to build more, have better defenses at our CAMPs against people who destroy them, etc. Also these servers aren't permanent. They have some kind of "maintenance" or restarts. And they are in some kind of cells that are loaded up only when a player is there.
---
I enjoy playing the game, even with the current issues. Although the complaints people are making are very much valid.
---
They are not "haters" or "trolls" the same you are not paid by Bethesda.
---
It's become more than just the content in the game, it's become about how Bethesda is handling everything. Time and time again they screw up and screw over people.
---
You give them money, you're just telling them they can get away with this shit.
---
I have two turrets but yeah I used to have a ton
---
Is it bulked? If not, go and do some bulking. It should pull it out. If it is bulked...wth are you doing to get so much?!
---
As many as it takes to make that CAMP dust...there are times I like to be very thorough. :)
---
NPCs? Plenty of NPCS around. You must have missed the narritive; you are emerging from a vault into a land that has been in close proximity to confirmed nuke touchdowns and also something like the bubonic plauge has infected humans, turned them into scorched, and then killed every human left standing.
---
In a certain perspective, this setup is really clever. You and your friends are America's best hope. The story is delievered via the remnants and records of those recently dead. The voice acting for the holotapes is some of the best I've heard of Fallout 3, NV, 4 that I've heard.
---
Yeah they did an amazing job on it. 
---
The gameplay graphics and sound are flawless, its amazing to finally play this with modernized (non tank/ fixed camera) controls.  
---
The story line similar in a broad sense, there are some tweaks here and there, some of the areas are pretty different, but my memory is a little fuzzy that far back :)  
---
Im just starting the B runs, so I havent seen the story from the other side. 
---
I will say the one small disappointment (I forgive them) is that they didnt implement the ”zapping” mechanic, which in the original is where choices you make in the A run can impact you on the B run. For brevity, this [link]( https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Zapping) lists all the examples. That being said, I dont know how they couldve implemented it in this one, since you dont start B run by loading your completed A run save file (which would remember your choices). You just start a new B run straight from the main menu.
---
As a bonus, They already announced a free dlc episode coming out this month. Bethesda: Gasp!
---
You were **imprecisely** talking about the dev stuff as you said "The game is objectively not good".  
---
Yeah its almost unbearable 
---
My problem isn’t with TSE guns my problem was they need to buff base gun damage to make guns across the board better. They should have bugged them by about 30% minus a few guns like shotguns,The Dragon, Gauss and few others. The ones that didn’t a 30% buff, but need about 15% buff.
---
Guns are way behind damage versus melee. Plus guns have high Repair costs. Ammo cost are high..and really high if primed. 
---
The 300% was reference to the damage that was Nerfed. They did a compounded nerf of multiple facets that effected the archetype of those  guns by 80%+75%+40% was the actually math of the nerf.
---
The issues is they didn’t or doesn’t seem like they understood the Meta. That they didn’t test how powerful a nerf this was. They need to raise base gun damage for users. It seem it was done with incompetence. Like a lot of things.
---
I’m not against the nerf of TSE. But they need to make guns in a good place. Like I said a 30% Base Gun Damage would have been the right direction to take.
---
The nerf was because of PVPers crying and TSE was the symbol of duping. Even though everything else was duped in mass droves also.
---
Lvl 90ish here, I consider myself somewhere between casual and "hardcore" as in I like to enjoy what the game has to offer, but I also like to get a killer build going. It is hard to enjoy the game when you have something that works for you, then 2 weeks later a patch comes out that makes you feel like you are back at lvl 30. I also don't appreciate the fact that Bethesda is treating this game as a more grind = more content type of game. I played since beta and understand some of the nerfs, but nerfing your game into a crater does nothing for your player base hardcore or not. It used to feel rewarding to play, now it feels like you get scraps and a big ol FU. I enjoyed the game, I am not mad at this game, I feel I got my $60 worth, I played for a solid 80+ hours, HOWEVER, I am enjoying it less now and am going to take a break. I will most likely play it again if it is still around in a year. I just can't keep playing the same 15 quests over and over again.
---
I’m running into your same issues. I’m following a quest and suddenly hit by enemies way above my level. 
---
Imagine someone raping your ass one day and thr police officer says "How did people become so entitled and serious over anal fissures? Because it hurts? Kick in the nuts can be more painful than this. A broken jaw in a bar fight is more painful than this. Some people lose their legs in wars."
---
dide.  i played this game from beta till now.   i have platinum trophied this game.   it has had horrible, game crashing bugs since launch.   with the nerfing of perks that actually made the game enjoyable (lookin at you white knight) i cant stick around.   its now a guaranteed 100+ hours of a ballistic fibre scavenger hunt.  
---
thats not cool for me, or a new person just joining the game.  
---
i hope they add content, not add to the grind.   
---
i hope they can get this game to a healthy place where it can be assessed fairly.  
---
right now its either “burn it all” or “theres nothing wrong, never has been carry on” 
---
theyre both wrong.  
---
Mole miner got her bad by the sounds of it , and might have been where she died in the end of things. 
---
Yup. This is worse than than the previous bug of not being able to repair an item without having to unbulk an item.
---
That would be an odd way of doing it, but Bethesda has done odder things. Other types of extractors with multiple in one build area (which is essentially what the purifier is) - like acid at Hemlock Holes or junk at Charleston Landfill - produce from individual pools as well.
---
The industrial purifier is listed as 60/hr, the purifier (smaller in-water one) at 24/hr, and the small purifier (dirt placement) at 8/hr. So even if they worked the way you're suggesting, 6 industrial purifiers would be full (5 each) in 30 minutes, which isn't happening. Even when I only have one running, it isn't producing even a quarter of what it should, if that.
---
Another commenter did some testing and confirmed that purifiers in workshops are producing water at the correct rate, but the purifiers in their camp are indeed not.
---
I can't tell you how many times I fast traveled all the way across the map to get to the Path of Enlightenment event only to have less than a minute left to do anything.
---
Eh, they work but you're still stuck in a hellhole. That's the point.
---
Afraid I'm on Pc so this may not be it.  I experienced the exact same thing and I had to redownload the patch.  I had to open and close the "Bethesda Launcher" like 3 times before it realized another patch was out.  Does Ps4 have a similar launcher?
---
No hate here. A lot of good points.
---
except you're *blindly* defending it. the game is not perfect, it's not even good. that's the point. they are **NOT** doing a good job, fact.
---
and crooked means bent, twisted, borked. that defines Fo76 perfectly. but considering the bags and rum, I'd definitely say dishonest defines Bethesda as well.
---
Well there's 20% of your budget that you could recoup right there. I've found turrets to mostly be a resource/budget waste for the most part. 
---
Oh man. This is the second post I have read about this. If it is true, it is the most inane thing ever, and makes me empathize with the wild aggressive anti F76 posts a lil. So let me get this straight:
---
1. The game auto-scrapped WHEN CRAFTING, calibrated and jetpack mods that took a month of server hopping to find. This was occuring for about 3 months.
---
2. Post most recent patch, they fixed that, yet a bonus negative affect was that WHEN CRAFTING no bulk would auto-scrap, creating two extra tedious steps to crafting (getting bulk from stash, and then manually scrapping it)
---
3. Post hot-fix, 'Scrap all', scraps bulk
---
There seems to be some confusion when talking about this because there is the 'Scrap all' option available at any crafting table, and the auto-scrap that happens when crafting. They are two different things. If I find this is actually happening by the time I log in tomorrow, it may be the last straw maybe.
---
I was initially worried about the small number of players per map, and small number of players per group, but after considering the alternative, I changed my mind. 
---
In Guild War 2, it was common to see twenty people spam attacking a monster at an event. Nobody's contribution was all that meaningful, and it felt crowded. A twenty person crowd would feel wrong in FO, particularly for the first vault to open. 
---
I like that you rarely see more than 2-4 people outside your group in FO76. It feels post-apocalyptic. We actually take note of the people we see. It's meaningful. Rather than adding more people to the server, I'd just like to see more events on the server that  draw 2-8 people together, preferably without drawing everyone. 
---
I still have OP builds. I was Level 203. I had plenty of perk cards and all the OP weapons. Bloodied,Furious,Instigating and Anti Armor.
---
It will effect your gameplay killing high level enemies at end game. Unless you run Sniper build,bloodied or Melee.
---
The hotfix really messed up a number of things namely: 
---
Wiping out bulk items when autoscrapping 
---
Depleting food and water and core levels faster regardless of perks
---
Critters disappearing - I had a legendary deathclaw just vanish into thin air on me 
---
&gt;That's for a game that's been out 3 months and has nothing but angry kids posting complaints all day.
---
Top, fucking, kek.
---
&gt;Had it been single player with an end credits after choosing whether to be the good guy and defeat the SBQ, or the bad guy and nuke morgantown, or the neutral guy, and wipe out whitesprings, no one would have anything to complain about outside of the typical Bethesda bugs.
---
'If it was something else and not what it is people wouldn't be complaining.' Top insight there.
---
&gt;Nothing will ever take away the fact that this is an excellent game.
---
Nothing will ever change &lt;subjective opinion&gt;.
---
&gt;Don't let trolls revise your own history, because many of them hated on the game from the start, or are leaves in the wind, carried wherever the slightest breeze takes them.
---
'Everyone that hates it either always hated it or is a fairweather fan.' Good excuse to hand wave away legitimate complaints. Those people just weren't really fans anyway.
---
&gt;Look at all the posts of people's crazy and fun experiences.
---
What posts? This game has had nothing but angry kids posting complaints all day.
---
Yeah but then that one level 1 scorched (i’m set up right near the overseer’s camp) will keep pounding away at my walls and doors
---
Thank you for more of the same emotional driven rhetoric shared by the *vast majority* of both positive and negative posters on this sub. Examples:
---
"vast majority" Source? Probably the same non-scientific one I borrowed for the above sentence.
---
"Banning people left and right" Source?
---
"deleting threads" Source?
---
"and it is absolutely necessary to call out every single decision they make" No it really isn't necessary. Food and water are necessary. 
---
"You have no right to complain" Everyone has the exact same right, complaint or praise.
---
"companies do not give a damn about you" Yes because they're too busy keeping you from finding the NASA guards at the end of our flat disk world. /s
---
I actually share your *opinion* that the game is flawed but some of us will still enjoy that same flawed experience until the next game we can afford/make time for/oversold on, etc. My OPINION is that the vast majority of people that play this game are tired of both the bugs and the overly emotional whiners and shills. We just want to come here to objectively share our experience in the hopes that it gets better. 
---
Most of us are not going to light torches and follow you to the castle. In my case that's based on my lack of time for crusades, still getting enjoyment out of the game and my inability to actually craft said torches. I did find a good article on it though: [https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Torches](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Torches).
---
p.s. I know someone is going to complain that Bethesda really dropped the ball because there are no torches in this game but there were in Skyrim. It must be the game engine. 
---
You can get a cryolater that shoots snow balls.
---
I do the same ussually.  I just can't be bothered. But someones gotta do it so we can leech and its alot of damn work for not much reward and that is really fucked up.
---
Melee is slightly overtuned. What’s going nutty is stacking buffs. Adrenal reaction + bloodied + all the other low HP buffs. 
---
Let’s not forget sentinel armor stacking.
---
To put it simply, the low HP builds are only ok if they are forced to deal with their disadvantage of having low HP, but they aren’t because of sentinel armor and other damage reduction methods letting them extend that 20-30% HP by quite a bit.
---
It’s a huge mess and the big B kinda blew it on TSE balancing sooo...it might be best to just call it and not try to launch big nerf calls anymore, guys. 
---
Good lord and I'm just running around struggling with a hunting rifle and a combat rifle lol. Thanks for the info!
---
Yup. I thought my I was balling out of control on junk collecting only to realize........
---
Destiny 2 Isn't a good example of that at ALL. Check the stats and see how many people have completed the raid(s), and how many have completed them on Hard mode. Destiny introduced those character boosters to actually *cut back* the grinding for alt characters. Transferring that maxed out gear to a character to finally hit the level cap let you power level much quicker, cutting back the grind even more. 
---
The issue with D2 on launch was that it peeled back alot of progress that D1 made towards the end of its lifecycle. The game was too easy to hit endgame. So they changed a bit, added raid content, introduced masterworks etc, and they made the endgame more grindy, but that didn't affect the majority. I highly doubt all D2 players are 1%'ers who complete all dailys, weeklies, exotic weapon quests AND have dedicated HOURS to invest into raid activities that sometimes, depending on the teams, may not even work out. 
---
I can't think of a title that caters to the 1%, because why would you alienate a majority of casual players for a tiny percentage of hardcore players? You would kill millions in potential sales, and from a business standpoint that's a terrible idea. Niche games that have a very target audience can get away with gameplay and mechanics that cater to a specific audience. Dark Souls/Demon Souls is an example. The average gamer might get frustrated at the difficulty, dying constantly and the learning curve. It's made to appeal to the patience gamer who likes a challenge. That's why most games encorporate a vast variety of activities within them that can appeal to different audiences. The average fallout player isn't going to do low health builds that give astronomical damage numbers, or have ten TSE weapons, or be lvl 200+ with alt characters equally as high. They dont have hundreds of hours put into a game thats 2+ months old.
---
The problem, like OP put out, is how people are getting fanatical with hoarding, Min/Maxing, and other uber-grinding techniques, and burning themselves out of content before the developers intended for the audience to do so. That's the 1%. This is a online, living game, that they plan to support for a foreseeable amount of time. If people have the time and dedication on-hand to do so, then that's their prerogative, im not going to judge. But the devs didn't intend for it, as seen by the lack of endgame content. It's clearly meant to be a slow burn, so I don't feel bad for the "im bored posts". If you're level 200 and you're bored..you're done man! you won, congrats. But don't think that entitles you to content made just for you because you surpassed the progress of the 90ish% of the rest of the game population.
---
OR when you fast travel and the event is there but doesn't trigger!  
---
OR when you kill the Scorchbeast Queen and only a couple of seconds after that the event Scorched Earth starts for you! Yay!  
---
Haha. We need more people like you
---
in techincal aspects, it isn't. that's factual, objective.
---
If you were freezing 4-6 times an hour on Xbox it was something with your machine or character because it wasn't effected most of us.  There was an issue with HUD displays on power armor.  Not sure on after patch because most of the people I played with quit, but a disconnect every 2-3 hours of gametime has been standard since beta.
---
For releasing a AAA game that could be produced better in Alpha by an Indie company?
---
She's not dead, otherwise who left the nuke holotape?
---
My favorite is when doing horde events, when you find the legendary the event ends "Event Complete" without any reward or the legendary showing up
---
Also acquiring the fusion generator saved me a lot of budget as well. 100 power per generator, cuts down on having to have multiple power sources.
---
Well this is fucking awkward...
---
This was the post I saw - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6edav/how_water_purifiers_currently_work_via_my_testing/
---
Large leap of logic. Grammar doesn’t equate to being able to code or work in the gaming industry. 
---
i agree if they don't count they should.  great crafting item for getting rid of excess steel.
---
This is the best way - full respec and refunding is hard to do and some will complain they don’t want to have to pick their perks over.  A few free perk points allowing people to choose something else eases the pain and in the bigger picture 5 free perk points doesn’t change much - most high levels are sitting on points they don’t know what to pt into - this helps the little guys who are hurt more by the changes.
---
ooh yeah i bought that the other day and I love it!
---
I've done it on my own plenty of times. It's tedious but not impossible. I once finished it with literally 10 seconds to spare. My big thing about it is sometimes not enough enemies spawn to help you complete the quest. Radtoads provide the most bioluminescent fluid, but sometimes I can't even find the damn fireflies.
---
Yes. It's an undocumented disease/bug called tapeworm.
---
This is something that may get pronounced as time goes on, especially with the Enclave vendor in the military wing. It did have 3 terminals but now only the centre one works, the other 2 say "this vendor is busy right now". I'm assuming it was something to do with duping methods as to why they've switched 2 of the terminals off. 
---
depends on level
---
Thats as may be, but please point out to me where you make that distinction in your first post.
---
I'm having an issue where I'm frequently in caution when enemies are far out of range. Tested this at the vault entrance - normally the Liberators down the hill have no clue anyone's up there. Now when I fast travel there while crouched I get 'caution.'
---
Exactly, any idiot can just slap on Dodgy 3 and Lone Wanderer 3 and all of a sudden become an absolute tank as long as you have AP, and those 2 perks alone are 60% raw damage mitigation, you stack sentinel or cavalier on top of it and you can reduced the damage you take by 87.5% before even factoring in your armor rating and now all of a sudden even though you only have like 40 HP nothing is hitting you for more than 1 or 2 damage a hit anyway.
---
I've seen half assed poorly optimized thrown together rad rage builds take slaps from high lvl (70+) Death Claws and their health bar doesn't even seem move....
---
from a vendor in watoga for 250 caps^
---
p.p.s. I blame my overly sarcastic response and grammatical errors on both the evils of smartphone use and 2 hour staff meetings.
---
You may find that Diseased enemies sometimes have legendary items. The Diseased prefix can cover up the Legendary one.
---
Well it’s at least clear the notifications are acting weird, since it shouldn’t spam like that lol.
---
I think it is a bit harsh overall. I spent 80 euro and I have gotten my moneys worth since way back. 
---
There is no monthly few or pay to win in the game so i do not understand how much people expert to get for a random restaurant bill value.
---
I understand that bugs, glitches etc has been a mess and still are but i think that Beth is very active with patching and doing so according to input from us on Reddit but regardless there is mainly hate for what is Done wrong, not Done yet or the canvas bag rants never end.
---
I have some issues with the objectively broken pieces in the game for sure but I think the game and progress of it so far is fully in Line with how Todd presented it on E3. It is as advertised, for good and for bad. But that seems to katter little.
---
Last nerfs for example. I agree fully with TSE nerf but not TS, that was going too far. But i am willing to be patient since balancing a massive game after every little snowflakes wishes is hard. 
---
They overall need to buff a lot of undesireable gear but atleast they are on the ball. 
---
But i understand people stopping to play. I do not understand the constant flaming regardless of Bethesda efforts though. It costs you nothing after purchase to play the game and if you have not received value for even 80 euro so far i do not get it. When it comes to content that is. I agree that the bugs/glitches has lowered the overall perception for me but the game and the world overall is just WAOW to me.
---
/fanboy that is ok
---
Simple solution to this whole fiasco is either keep playing it with all its faults or simply stop playing it.
---
Bethesda didn’t give AF before release, after release and sure as hell won’t give AF into the future. They probably don’t give AF for the people who defend them.
---
All Bethesda is doing now is polishing a turd and either lap it up or just be an adult and walk away.
---
A recent patch changed the value back to 0.1 as the lead developer left his dog in his office, hotfix is expected.
---
Yeah. One that just grants the same coded protection against environmental rads, but without the 1000 that protects against rad attacks.
---
Know what else would if they scaled somehow? Throwing weapons!
---
Throwing knives are so fun when you’re level 1-15. Good times...
---
"Fact Checking"
---
We've all been playing this thing. We don't need help with the facts.
---
"running from a scorchbeast and hiding in a cave from it only to realize the cave is a deathclaw nest and I am now trapped, good times."
---
I did that, it was a bit of a shock, thinking I was safe, then getting knocked on my butt and having a a toothy maw in my face.  That was awesome!
---
"How to shut down legitimate concerns and criticism"
---
Make Artillery Great Again would've been better
---
objective means factual. by using the word "objectively", I'm already stating that I'm talking about non-subjective things, such as technical aspects.
---
Fo76 is not good. that's a fact despite our personal feelings towards the game.
---
I'm not blindly defending anything, I know damn well what game I'm playing and defending. Your opinion is simply different than mine, doesnt make me enjoy the game any less. Its a great fucking game. 
---
And no that doesnt define 76 perfectly, its actually quite off. You are wrong as hell my friend and I can tell getting into specifics with you will be a waste of time. Peace out. 
---
Level 130. I’ve completed all quest solo except for the Scorched Beast Queen. Only have teamed up a couple of times and that was lower level vault dwellers asked me for help. 
---
Just trying to determine the intent of your comment.
---
You make specific derogatory remarks about a game you don’t play or have no experience with.
---
If you’re unfamiliar with the game, why the hate?
---
If you are familiar with the game but no longer play, why troll and linger in a sub that you don’t play?
---
grasping for straws
---
It's funny because one of the threads I saw complaining about it was from a casual player that used the TSE to make his un-min-maxed build viable, but whatever
---
Eat each other because this is what you signed up for
---
What I don't get is if you are going to deviate from stated cannon, then why even pretend it's cannon?
---
It just pisses people off, and just make it confusing
---
It's okay to be your own thing.
---
It's okay to go your own way.
---
STOP WITH THE PREQUEL SHIT!
---
We don't need Kirk/Spock it's been done, go make someone/something new.
---
AAAAAAAAagh!
---
I have hopes this game will no man sky.
---
I would gladly accept the 800 caps bounty. 
---
" its now a guaranteed 100+ hours of a ballistic fibre scavenger hunt."
---
It is that because that is what you make it to be.  You could make a different choice, but that is your call.
---
Yea, that was my mistake. Thanks for clearing it up everyone!
---
Those are deals between devs and game publishers the retailer has nothing to do with it, while this one is one is done by the retailer.
---
I'm seriously waiting on more of this story.
---
I actually super enjoy her holotape series.
---
My favorite weapon honestly.
---
Ive done whitespring solo a few times (everyone had already left so i had the place to myself with respawned bloateds) Had maybe a bum rush of 20 bloateds, a few legendaries 
---
tagged each one from the roof with a shot then threw a Orbital while theyre all clawing at me, get out of the way and BOOM
---
6,000 XP
---
This sub is not in touch with reality. There is no point trying to say any good or bad things about the game here. 
---
That said, I do agree with you, but we are all Don Quixote's here.
---
You don’t have other subs you follow? Only Fallout 76.?
---
Probably not high on the priority list right now.
---
Did you follow the Overseer's story or just wander? I find her story interesting. To be honest I only really started being bored / complaining after I finished all the quests. 
---
Look here. Since you are here anyway.
---
As long as they don't make fishing poles/nets a recipe you have to find. Maybe for higher quality ones, but a basic one you can make out of a stick and some string? That'd be a deal breaker for me. I'm still swimming in infused steeped soot flower tea recipes.
---
Melodrama is strong with this one
---
True, i could've reworded it a little better, tbh I tend to forget about the grenade launcher, never even fired one 
---
Dude, this is an awesome design!
---
Correct. 0 XP earned from your turrets. It’s absolutely pointless to do this. The only thing you are doing is stealing kills and legendaries for absolutely ZERO reason. You are only hurting others by doing this.  
---
Maybe they'll add that to the Atom Store. "Deluxe C.A.M.P. Upgrade -- Expand your build budget by 25%"
---
If I shouldn't use PA in a blast zone as a shot gun build you're suggesting I use a hazmat suit? No way man. I crit him with a shotgun in VATs. It didnt miss. 
---
This is needed if they really want players to develop their own economy and start selling items. Also, they stated that they want players to mod other players weapons. There needs to be a way to negotiate that transaction without just giving a weapon away and hopping the give it back. Maybe a player could use the workbench of another player. and if that player has the crafting perks necessary, for a fee the visiting player could craft using those perks. And that fee would go to the benches owner.
---
Then why FO76 and not RDR2 ?
---
only $99.99
---
In the past yes. I would go there and kill her....yes i had a TSE Guass. I would spend 200 rounds or so and usually i would see 10-20 people show up.
---
Now I dont bother with Her at all. the rewards are simple not worth the cost of the ammo i spend. Now with the nerfs the fight is so long I will spend 600-800 rounds with a good chance time will run out. 
---
Honestly I bet a lot of people just stopped rushing to nuke zones the way we used too. I go for the flux and meat now.
---
What do you base that on? I look forward to see the evidence before i waste even more time.
---
The blast zones are ridiculously tiny and I don’t feel like they change the landscape much at all. It’s supposed to be a nuke, make me feel like I’m getting nuked 
---
Untrue! For exams ballistic fibre can either be bulk and sold or just sold (although you would need to be pretty crazy to do either). I think the true reason is that originally bulking was supposed to save space/weight but some time through development they scraped this probably because the way that bulking items rounds decimal places upwards. That why steel scrap is worth zero but bulking it raises the value to 30. 
---
I hate the nerf but there are low level places to find it. You can get military duct tap and ammo bags at camp mcclintock and wade airport. many other places as well. 
---
I love that place. That holotape is one of my favorites.
---
That was my goal, thank you. 
---
And the marked76. The only reason I created a Reddit account.
---
Yeah, performance is noticably worse on Xbox One for me. I literally cannot play, it's so bad that I can only hit anything with VATS and that's just not viable for my build right now.
---
Just started the game and haven't seen any issues lol
---
My guess is that bloodied explosive will be the new meta. I don´t have unyielding gear, chems and bobbleheads. What i have here is all perks and full stack of adrenaline.
---

---
Oh good lort! Just remove weapons entirely... We can fight with emotes! Until someone cry's about my emote being OP and it also get's Nurfed lol.
---
&gt;objective means factual. by using the word "objectively", I'm already stating that I'm talking about non-subjective things, such as technical aspects.
---
Again, there is is nothing in your original comment that denotes this.  
---
&gt;Fo76 is not good. that's a fact despite our personal feelings towards the game.
---
You're doing it again.  "Not Good" is not a measurable metric. 
---
And they also weight 0.1 each!
---
..it's an interesting dynamic in these times. I'd like to know the breakdown between people that simply play these types of games in a vacuum, and those that are like us, playing the game while being involved, either lurking or participating, in on line social groups such as reddit and YouTube. There's a definite mob mentality that forms. Anger is heightened, perhaps beyond that which is warranted.
---
Personally, I'm 51 years old, been playing since Christmas, and am level 26. Generally, I'm enjoying my experience.
---
My only real complaint is getting my ass kicked every time one of you high level players wander into my area. But it's something that I add to the role playing..that and managing my carry weight and stash and crappy weapons. Surviving in this world shouldn't be easy.
---
But having said that, yup, I've had those inconvenient server disconnects where you're almost through an area and have used most of your ammo and stims then whammo! The enemies reset..but your resources are still gone.
---
But it's a game. Not life.
---
This would work if there was somewhere in game where the laid back casual can easily find a crafter easily - unfortunately it requires knowing who to friend and switching servers and then the crafter has to be online and not busy.  Without a centralized hub for trading/crafting this 24 per server system is pretty much useless for in game trading, player vending and such.
---
They should turn one of the unopened Vaults into a no combat trading hub where the whole community can join without player limits.
---
Not an older IT type, just an older computer nerd...but yea Hotfix, hot-swap, hot plug. But I prefer the *archaic* usage of hotfix.
---
I try to build near things that offer some assistance to my build like water or food. Food takes a chunk out of your budget so having it locally sourced helps. Lights dent the build as well.
---
It is one of the cheaper ways to get plans.  The weapons and armor are standard, and just something you would scrap or dump at a vendor.
---
That's it....buying it tomorrow!!!!!
---
Unyielding if youre a melee or stealth sniper build and bolstering maybe for more run n gun type
---
Just a heads up. It's also Austria and Switzerland as well as Germany. Also not just Gamestop; Saturn is giving people a free copy of fo76 with any purchase of an XB1 fo76 bundle. That's right....buy an xbox and get 2 copies of fo76.
---
My feeling is that this game is going to have to transition to f2p at some point. However, I don't see that as a bad thing. I see it as the only real way to salvage the game and make it great. If Bethesda goes the way of ESO, then FO76 will survive but it won't grow and it won't be great. A 15-20 per copy version of FO76 will be enough to keep the servers running but not enough to fund additional development. Going f2p will force Bethesda to make the atom shop into something people want to visit and spend money on.
---
I enjoy FO76 and hope that Bethesda ultimately finds some way to support it's growth long term.
---
This is another "how in the world had this not been fixed yet?!"
---
If your game only has one boss it damn well better function properly. Completely unacceptable.
---
Well, 9/10 times I go for the junkyard after login :).
---
Daily reminder that you liking a shitty game doesn't make the game good, people like Adam Sandler movies for example.
---
Will do, thanks)
---
I'm using rifle
---
I'm going to see if i find a new game that will make me as addicted then fallout 76.
---
But also, this was the last tape I found.
---
Not sure if they have an order they're supposed to go in, but I found this one after meandering through the other 16.
---
0) Gaming on consoles is different to gaming on PC. Consoles have just 1 specific hardware setup. So games are tailored to it. The hardware of the console might not provide more than 60Hz by specifications, but pc hardware is different. With a PC your fps are just limited by the internal hardware.
---
0.5) Yes, they can play with 60fps. They can also play with 30fps (which was long a standard). The main problem is when the refresh rate or fps is unstable. Then we can really "see" moving pictures and stuttering.
---
1) Because the monitor/hardware supports it?! I think Bethesda also thought: "Why should some weird ultra wide resolutions be supported?" It's also the same as asking: Why do we need 4k support or 4k textures for potatoes? Simple answer: There are monitors for it, so customers (gamer) simply want a support.
---
2) Technical issues: Because the monitor supports it. And I'm not sure if Fallout 76 supports proper V-sync, G-sync or whatever synch. So there might be tearing/flickering, when the monitor demands 140Hz input, but just gets a new frame every 1/60 seconds.
---
3) PC-master race: What's the purpose to buy a RTX2060Ti or whatever when a game limits the output to 60Hz? Why should I spend an additional amount of money for better equipment, when there is a software "limit" to the refresh rate?
---
4) Okay, fine. So assuming that humans can't see more than 60 fps. Now assume that a black square is moving from the lower left to the upper right corner of your display on a white background (high contrast required). Depending on the speed of the square it moves a certain amount of pixels per second. If the square moves 60 pixels per second, it moves every frame 1 pixel (thus 60fps). Double the speed and it moves 2 pixel per second. And when you double that again, it moves 4 pixels. When the distances the square moved within 2 frames is too big, it can be distinguished and "seen" by the human eye. With other words: When the difference between 2 frames is too big, the "moving pictures" can be seen - that's the reason why stuttering can be seen.
---
So guess what. Increasing the fps will make this square "moving" fluently again.
---
And yes, this definitely depends on many things like the size of the object, edges, lightning, contrast, the human being, etc.
---
But don't argue that a human can only see 60fps!
---
Another argument if you are familiar with those thumb cinemas. Play them on a certain speed and then remove every xth frame until you see that stuttering. Same effect. This is, because information is lost between frames and the gaps are too big for the brain to not see them.
---
TL;DR: I don't say we need 500fps, but more than 60fps like 140 are more or less another industrial standard (PC/monitors). When the frame rate for certain actions is too low (depends on the situation) we can see stuttering. This can be removed by increasing the fps. But a hard limit is a hard limit, so also a RTX2080Ti won't help.
---
You're just simply incorrect in your assessment. Not sure what else to say.  Typing long winded analyses doesn't mean you're correct.
---
I hate to argue over semantics but they didn't hotfix it and hate that they keep using that term. A hotfix means the server doesn't go down, hence the term "hot". Like how you don't have to shutdown servers to change harddrives if they have hotswappable harddrive bays.
---
You *lost* a character? Damn that hurts... How is that possible? 
---
only after she is done cooking my tendies tho
---
They don’t want to hear things like that. 
---
&gt;I'm not blindly defending anything
---
you just said they are doing a great job. that's factually untrue. you'd have to be blindy defending the game to say otherwise.
---
which you did.
---
&gt;And no that doesnt define 76 perfectly
---
I could waste hours of my day listing every bug in the game, bugs that have no excuse to exist at this point in development. but I believe it'll be enough just pointing out that the final boss in the game requires an event that will crash/kick you out half of the time.
---
I have it built right on the river across from the overseer’s camp. I get the water easy and most of my food comes directly from shit I kill. With rank 2 pharma farma I get disease cures like nothing
---
It's hard to cook tendies like that bro
---
Hehe spot on
---
it has happened to a lot of folks, and the work around is to have a friend or team mate at the event so you can get back to that server which a lot of people here also know.  As to how you are still having these server issues:
---
Things break and connections are lost for a lot of reasons, some of which are caused by the game, some are do you the network xbox and ps4 players connect to to play, some by your home network.  So there will always be the potential for connection drops to occur.  
---
I'm having the exact opposite experience on PS4.  No disconnects and the world loads way faster.  No more floating head for 2 mins after logging in waiting for my clothes to spawn.
---
One small quibble is that while if they don't have data on player behavior something weird is going on, behavior data isn't disposition data. You cannot 100% accurately infer a disposition from behavior alone. That is why even brief surveys can help identify potential disconnects. Essentially, even if the player is successfully doing something, if they think they aren't then there is still something wrong with the design (whether that be something fundamentally wrong or just not sufficiently informing them what happened).
---
Max rifleman perks, vats/luck build.  Yet i can easily take out my axe and kill a lvl68 in 2 swings with no melee perks.  Naaaaa. It aint OP.  
---
Seeing as our choices of food are irradiated monsters or old food so packed with preservatives our descendants will be eating them 200 years later, we aren't exactly in a position to be picky.
---
Same for me, last night when i logged in i was immediately in caution, nothing in sight, even looked around. Also i was inside my house with the doors locked and crouched. But later it fixed itself, might have been a temporary thing.
---
Build some place high up with low enemy spawns, put 1 good missle turret on a roof guarding the chock point. Anything more than 1 turret really kills your budget.
---
2 minutes, must be nice,  just last night i got there as it was ending,  enough to get the join and wont stuff to pop up, but then got no rewards.
---
Last time I tried to do this event I only found two toads in the total time. 
---
I agree guns could use a buff to a degree but that would NEVER have happened with tse in the state it was.
---
Guns are actually in terms of dmg per second on par with melee(when running average builds)if you both attack a target a distance away( in the thick of things melee wins but that's normal) I cannot even count the amount of kills I've had stolen and stole myself from melee users even without tse.
---
 The main reason weapons break fast if they are a fun is two shot half's the durability try a non twoshot weapon it's fine tbh. Also use superduper and ammo Smith and you can be swimming in ammo due to how easy lead and steel are to get
---
The 300% was a way to make it seem like a unbelievablely big Nerf "ruining" the weapon which isn't true my tse lever action still does fine damage is it as op as it was no but it's useable.
---
It's stated multiple time throughout the patch notes they were bringing out of line perks back into line hence things like the white knight Nerf. The only recent PvP related change that made any significant difference was the fireproof buff.
---
I used to think that, too, until I started digging into sources. The result wasn't pretty. Lots of interpretation, some sources aren't even available any more. To be fair, though, academic papers by undergraduates and graduates aren't much better. People either can't read to save their lives or simply don't care. 
---
Unyielding has a lot of advantages and barely any defensive ones. Bolstering only provides extra defense.
---
You get the fusion generator from doing that repairing event. Unless you’re a very low level I’m surprised you didn’t have it before now.
---
And there is no incentive any more, besides getting that plan for free. The effort and time required is no where near worth the rewards.
---
Its like that guy that buys a luxury sports car then puts loads of stupid bells and whistles on it
---
And? You just need one costume to get this incredible gamechanging bonus ...
---
After the hotfix I noticed a LOT of loot issues.  I had to wait a good minute or so for each corpse to finish it's loot loading spinning arrows thing before I could see anything.
---
I also noticed that while we had 20 somethings ghouls come out of whitesprings golf club, once we'd killed them all, I could only loot about half of them.  I do not know if this is an issue with explosion ammo radius not tagging enemies, or if it's a latency issue, or just something new with the hotfix.  But, in a solid group of players, all of us making sure everyone gets a tag... all of us were getting to loot less enemies than we killed.
---
Beer bottles are plentiful - back when I was crafting them to sell to vendors  I’d run out of things like oil first and end up with dozens of beer bottles.  Every train station seems to have them and so many other places.
---
950 hours, farmed for mats to build radium rifles to learn mods, hung out in the wasteland. 
---
I quit the game after the nerfs as none of my friends want to play the game any more as its just, farm mats, kill legendary, hope for item to drop, go waste 1k+ bullets and stims on a queen with a bunch of level 30's in order to get one 2* armor piece.
---
Deffo had fun but not any more, most higher level players can't be bothered with the game now and I don't really feel the need to play a game just to help people fix their guns. 
---
Here's an idea. 
---
Stop playing this shitty game and stop supporting shitty devs
---
I thought they made kids immortal? 
---
Then i would use unyielding cause of perception which affects vats accuracy, agility which affects ap points in vats and luck for crits plus some bloodied sniper and youre set
---
Yup let me switch to my minigun so I can fire 500 rounds of 5mm into a ghoul that ends up still standing afterwords. 
---
i've solo'd the entire way through all questlines.  i am level 48.  
---
To the guy who already commented PS4 does not have the same launcher.
---
To OP, try to rebuild your database after you clear your cache. If that doesnt work you may have to uninstall the whole game and reinstall. 
---
To clear cache: completely power down system and wait for the light bar to go off. Then unplug the system for about 5 minutes (they say 10 seconds but I like to give the capacitors in the memory time to completely discharge). 
---
To rebuild database: when you plug the system back in long press the power button until you hear a beep, should be about 15 seconds or so, then use a connected controller and scroll down to option 5: Rebuild Database and select that. 
---
It’s survivability vs power. If you can’t decide, consider running half and half. My wife ended up doing that lol
---
A trailer hitch...lmao
---
I saw a demon Wednesday towing a trailer. Lol
---
And non-lengedary enemies sometimes drop legendary items, that needs to fixed too right?
---
Should of read '**Scorched Earth = waste of time'** Unless you're a huge ultracite Explosive vent guy
---
I hope they've got a modeler full-time working on more beds.
---
Theres alot of people who dont spend the money on food or a bar or weed,we spend our hard-earned money on a past time that we enjoy to do. So when we get screwed over we have every right to be upset about it.
---
Well this is what you get when you bolt on a pre-existing currency like caps to a game that designed to have an mmo currency. I reckon originally the game was supposed to use pre-war money before they canned in development and switch to caps. 
---
And why is that?
---
I'm sorry Bethesda but after taking a long break of playing the game so bugs can be fixed I think I've had the last straw. Hate to be a part of the recent negativity in the subs but after an hour of playing lost my xo1 protype power armor with all the mods on it when getting into a new power armor chassis. Went to reddit to see if anyone had the same issue but no. All my friends stopped playing and I just play alone. Now... I have to agree with them about this game being to broken to play anymore.
---
I *only* nuke other areas, to try and discover new sources of flora. 
---
Wii fishing was the shit
---
Would gladly waste all my ammo and explosives destroying the shit out of that, pos owner
---
Yeah, that's what most are saying.  Very likely true.
---
Consoles seem to work differently than PC 
---
correct. alternatively, excavator already comes with the 100 extra carry. if you put your calibrated servos (shocks) on that PA; you get a max of 450. 
---
Vendor Bot Greg in Grafton sells the plans for Calibrated servos (shocks) now that all vendors sell all the plans they were programmed to sell. He has all excavator plans
---
You can find Raider PA plans with Vendor Bot Resin, and Vendor Bot Phoenix has all T-Type PA plans.
---
XD I love this, but its gotta start at 4. Or it'll be annoying trying to help low cha folks with their quests since you need to make them lead to see theyre current objectives.
---
Uh, have they made good on this yet?
---
Idk maybe it can but I just thought it was a glitch
---
Bloodied explosive i guess. The following picture is at low health with all damage perks and full stack of adrenaline. No damage increasing mutations, bobbleheads or chems.
---
every train station is littered with beer bottles, I don't see a problem here...
---
Or alternatively, seeing someone nuke Fissure Prime, travelling to drop off junk, and by the time you get to the blast zone she’s already dead.
---
Lolz 
---
You replied saying not a problem since you don’t play anymore.
---
Your feigned outrage and indignation just proves it.
---
Most of the people that play the game are solo casuals, and a significant number are friends/family pairs.  You might want to check out www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/ sometime. 
---
yes it is VERY new.  i should know how my stealth feels, its been my playstyle since november.  besides any existing issue i was super stealthy with my max sneak+garb of mysteries.  also the white DETECTED wasnt because of any neutral npc.  i was in middle of mire with nothing around me and it was doing it.  
---
Because you personally dislike the game doesn't make it worthless. 
---
Yes. Also I still can’t fast travel to Grafton. It just will not do it.
---
Use the simple pipboy for Christ sake this like the 5th post I’ve seen about this
---
are you ok? the very fact I wrote "OBJECTIVELY" denotes that I'm not talking about subjective things.
---
for example: objectively, the graphics are not good and the PR is worse, abysmal. I could list other things but I believe that's enough.
---
you want me to measure just how much the graphics suck or the PR is messing up? because that's more work than it's worth.
---
Yeah turn the sound down.
---
Grab a friend, let him take the bounty after you demolish it.  Get your money back after.
---
Even if you can't do that... totally worth the cap loss to smash this guys camp.
---
I have every mutation except carnivore.
---
with Class Freak *3 ive only ever had my strength go down to 10 (its normally at 11)
---
but I also run Solar Powered and Radicool so usually every special i have is positive. 
---
This latest patch did mess with my Marsupial but every other mutation is working fine.
---
I did inherit a infinite running glitch though.
---
i never run out of AP, it stays at the very last little spot and never depletes. I ran from Morgantown to Poseidon without ever having to stop.
---
And for only $10 more we will give you an extra 0.25%!
---
Though it should noted that sales don't equal active players.
---
Remove all turrets - at lower levels there’s a tendency to build a ton of turrets.  I’m down to 2 machine guns but most bug camp builders go with none.
---
I can agree on the work that was put into the design aspect and that devs are working 24h a day to fix this mess. Marketing? Well that was done in a No man's sky fashion with Todd Howard already perfectly trained to build hype on lies. + nylon bag-gate, etc. 
---
Management? It is either terrible or non-existent considering what a mess this game continues to turn into. They were probably too busy enjoying this wonderful game, not to notice they were putting old bugs back in fo76 with last patch. 
---
The sword was pretty awesome.
---
Also flare darts are a thing.
---
Fallout 4 was a singleplayer game with a completed story. If you want to compare it to 76, which I wouldn't, 76 doesn't look to good in comparison, being purely a multiplayer game and all.
---
The [DANGER] thing long after you're near any enemies has been a problem since the beta, at least occasionally. Dunno if it's worse now but it happens to me every other day or so.
---
They do need to significantly reduce the amount of work required for each of the three steps.  And make them all clearly marked rather than just "this area".  Now that the only benefit is some 100 caps and a couple aid items, and a plan you can buy for 300 caps from vendors any time you want.
---
I did my three power up events for the plans a couple months ago, and I always struggled on the repair the reactor portion.  could never find the proper spots in the maze of the power plans, and would always end up in some reactor cooling rod room with massive rads.  I actually fell in the cooling pool once.  That was a massive rad hit.
---
Support helped me out, all good
---
I run the weight perks , but I swap out the ones under strength after I get to the Scorched Earth event.  Only takes  a few seconds.  Then once done I swap them back.
---
In Australia, despite any thing you click on, it is the over riding law that you could get a refund. Steam had to put an apology in it's launcher for trying to get around it. I am sure this doesn't actually help you, but I thought you might find it interesting. And, no, you can't, without lawyers probably.
---
Yeah, XB1, I'm caution or danger almost all the time now. I submitted a ticket.
---
Haha, my build is stealth melee w/ a TSE Gauss for when necessary...RIP my build!
---
Idk I'm not the manager at German GameStop.
---
Yup, had that happen a few times. I’ve always assumed that it’s finished just before I got there.
---
The game is great it just has random crashes for me on console
---
I think he means this has been a problem for awhile, even if it's maybe gotten a lot worse or more frequent now. I've definitely had this problem for as long as I can remember.
---
I noticed they turned into tumbleweeds all of a sudden 
---
I have the same issue on PC. As soon a I crouch I am in caution almost immediately when mobs are very far away. In the past I was able to very close without problems but now the whole zones seems to aggro me. I also get a bug where i can hear mobs like they were next to me but they are a 15 sec run away.
---
I think this definitely needs more traction.
---
So Im not allowed in here hoping for an update thats fix all the problems? 
---
After the patch I decided to give a stealth build a try. I had 4 pieces of chameleon legendary armor I had been saving in my stash. I had all the sneak-related perk cards maxed out.
---
It was abysmal.
---
Enemies detected me from a mile away.
---
I can't see my damn crosshairs because my f\*&amp;!%g gun is invisible.
---
I was always in "DANGER" mode but could still fast travel.
---
After laboriously clearing two separate areas just to give it a fair chance I said screw that and went back to hulk mode.
---
The funny thing, is that when you pick up a molotov from a counter/shelf/ground, it is in a white vodka bottle
---
*pats you on the back*
---
-A Steelers Fan
---
Mayfield is a beast, by the way.
---
Depends on the gun. Combat Rifle isn’t usable unless it has bloodied or Anti Armor or Furious.
---
I get shotguns,Gauss,Black powder m,Dragons and Lever actions are still usable. Handmade still useable to extent.
---
All speed baby!!
---
This happens if you open it before the game fully loads pull up your map and it sometimes fixes it or just wait for loading or fast travel
---
the toads usually respawn quickly, and there are more of them down that hill area kinda hiding on the rocks.
---
Then you should have gone to the government agency to inform them to enforce that law.
---
I got starvation from building my house....and then dysentry and parasites from what i used to replenish my bars...
---
I uninstalled for reasons other than the patch. I booted up the game after a hard day of work. I started to walk from one bunker in the swamp zone to another while sticking to the road only to be annihilated in seconds by a scorchbeast. I decided at that point that I was no longer having fun with the game and uninstalled it on the spot.
---
Love how you didn’t bother bringing up the massive number of horrible bugs and optimisation issues and how they “don’t affect gameplay that much”.
---
Schooled? I said I wasn't using a tse. I've never even had one. So no. Its nothing to do with that. It has to do with the fact the I can solo a lvl 90 boss super mutant behemoth no problem, but some some guy in a spacesuit 1 shots me with a death claw hand. It's just kinda stupid. And you're saying "if you aimed for the leg of guy running at you and jumping with marsupial and crippled him and then shot his arm so he couldn't have power attacked you and then kited him youd be able to kill him." Like seriously? I have to be a perfect machine with 0 error to kill a jumping asshole with a claw? No. Its OP.
---
They're always plentiful for me in my other save, but I'm my explosive build, since I'm tossing them out like hotcakes, I'm always short 
---
Yes their banning for mules as well it. Love your response 😂😂😂
---
Yet Sony has had major data losses of user data..... What 8 times now?
---
My dream for this game was to survive a nuke blast in a puwolski preservation shelter. That dream is not yet realized
---
Regular Rad x yes it has.. diluted didn't mess with mutations before patch/hotfix. I haven't tried it since.
---
I'm no longer crashing to the home screen, but still seeing plenty of server disconnects, and load in freezing.
---
Gosh I wonder people are downvoting you. Maybe it’s because without armor you can’t play effectively and without spending hours upon hours grinding you can’t have said armor?
---
The game is shite no matter what type of player you are....
---
I feel like thats fucked in some way, if something I see has legendary in the name, If I kill it, I should get a legendary drop, it makes sense in my book. We gotta push to get this fixed.
---
Lolz but they got your money..
---
Wrecked.
---
I think your definition of 'tickle' is way off. I can tell you are angry but not if you are serious.
---
It's definitely negatively effecting gameplay in a large way. Abilities, mutations, certian legendaries and stealth attacks only work out of combat or hidden. This is pretty devistating to any of those.
---
I've tried those and it sometimes works but other times it stays that way and I have to exit out 
---
I had Serendipity pop off while i was at the Watoga Station just trading with nothing nearby
---
i dont have it equipped. Gave me a good laugh
---
Bethesda wont do it, Arthmoor is literally sucking their D all day everyday and they still havent implemented his unofficial patches into any of the games.
---
I’d nuke that so fast. 
---
This! There is so much flexibility to a build when you have some cards at both 3 stars and 1 star. Sometimes I just want Max damage. Sometimes I want good damage and more flexibility. Duplicates are great for that.
---
and what does that have to do with anything I just said?
---
There's one that won't spawn until after you launch a nuke that implies she was there to see it
---
I'm sorry but what exactly do you mean by "simple"
---
That is one positive positive Point of this update, grabbed the Plan a few min after loggin in the first time 
---
Oh, I know that I mean being under maximum weight in inventory and still not being able to take stuff from the stash.
---
Thank you, I'm gonna try that now
---
yeah as said any existing issue aside, the last major patch jan 29th may have unintentionally messed with pve stealth in general.....  basically i logged off pissed after just 1 hr of play.  i want to address for everyone who thinks issue has been here since beta, it hasnt been this bad.  stealth build was viable even not if not perfect.  now my super stealthy glass cannon build is 100% broken.  even dumb low perception super mutants are seeing me from a mile away.  
---
"Stealth: Addressed an issue in which stealth damage bonuses could still be applied by a sneaking player’s attacks during PVP even that player was within their target’s direct line of sight."
---
Okay I hate to share this information, but, use an explosive Gatling gun with martial artist.  Probably the best gun out there.  Can still mow down the Queen.  Shoot the ground instead of shooting her directly.  Break her body parts with a shotgun or other weapon then unload on her.  She’ll die quickly. 
---
So my situation is the second, having more than 2k. Whats the deal with that? They need to hotfix that up.
---
For $50 we’ll grant you a single extra light bulb!
---
I bet you are fun at parties. 
---
You can still use combat rifles you just need to use get this... A build and not just rely on OP perks are you going to oneshot everything you hit? No but you can still two or three tap that's the trade-off for being able to twotap from miles away. also anti armour is pretty trash in most cases very few things have over 100 defence and the highest( the queen) is only 300(225 in a competent team)
---
Was about to say this, it works.
---
Saw a guy in tesla modded armour run through the club house then over to his missile turrets
---
Okay thanks
---
They've already talked about increasing the damage. :)
---
I did, it was tedious and boring as all she does is revisit people who are. you know. dead.  Why it didn't end in her suicide is beyond me tho, it'd fit more with the environment.
---
I don't care about the other so called factions as they just plain don't interest me.  They are all dead so it really doesn't matter.
---
And it's groundhog day it'll all just reset in a few minutes.
---
I had around 10 *** legendaries drop no Legos past night
---
My bet is on NV, the DLC achievements plus those Gun Runner ones required multiple playthroughs, unless those arent counted? Not sure
---
I have 3 toons at 75+ at 202 hours. If you played earlier on, it was much easier than it is now to level. Nuke zones were giving 3-4x the xp at twice to three times the rate they are now. They're still very lucrative as far as leveling goes, but meh levels don't mean anything once you're full build. Even for the longest builds that should only be around 75ish. My heavy weapons gunner was full build at 73 for instance.
---
Seems like an annoying bug. Did you try switching servers or using some junk to see if that updates it somehow?
---
Bethesda overlooked a lot of things similar to this. For example, martial artist increased the Gatling guns fire rate, shotgun perks affected the grenade launcher, etc.
---
Here is a perspective from a "normal" player by your standards. Last time I played, I was at level 33.
---
I'm not comically outraged by this game as you describe in your post that some of these people are. I don't get controller-smashing mad about Bethesda pushing out a shitty game. Doing so is stupid, it's a video game.
---
So what am I? Very disappointed and completely unimpressed with what was marketed, vs what arrived. I understand that bugs and small issues happen when something new is tried. But this whole experiment was so half-baked, and so untested, that releasing it as an intended AAA game and all the expectations that go with that was an awful idea. It's the idea of what was sold, vs what arrived. Everything from the merchandise to the game itself. I would be totally cool if Bethesda had originally said, "get we got this thing we wanna try, it's gonna be a bumpy ride, but get in on this for cheap, bear with us, and hopefully we can develop a neat multiplayer fallout from it". Instead they sent Todd up on stage to blow smoke up everyone's ass about how this was some incredible new journey that would completely change the fallout franchise, and everything was roses. Instead of Fallout: The Great New Idea, we got Fallout 4: The Afterbirth.
---
So where does that leave me as a casual fallout player? I've seen enough finally, and I'm done. If a game even remotely matching the expectations set had been put out, we would not be constantly having these conversations. I really bought into this one, and because I had loved the fallout franchise with previous games like FO3, NV, and FO4, I figured this would be quality as well. But Bethesda has made just about every mistake one can make to kill a reputation with customers. From over-promising and under-delivering, to unresolved issues and apathetic customer support, it's easy to see that the game studio has thrown in the towel. So I have as well. There are other things I can do in life than play a game I increasingly dislike the more I play it.
---
So no, I'm not mad, I'm not going to go on YouTube to sperg out and rage about my shitty Chinese PA helmet coming in a nylon sack, but I will reply to a post that claims to speak for me. It does not. I have removed the Fallout76 disc from my PS4, and it's probably never going back. I'm just simply disappointed, and have given up.
---
If you're on PC you can actually still go kill her.  Add this to your custom ini:
---
[General]
---
bBorderRegionsEnabled = 0
---
Hop the fence and you'll find her high up in the sky not going anywhere, and you can shoot her down from there.
---
This is very true.  If you decide to respec some, you will be glad you have the lower ranked versions.
---
I think it's just really a matter of character. I'm with you on this one:
---
&gt;  I have over a hundred hours in the game and it's better than most games I've played
---
Some people can just enjoy whatever they have, in the present, others can't. This is valid for everything not just games.
---
Now personally I'm a bit tired of the game, but it's just because I finished the story, not because of the bugs. When there is a storyline left to discover it's easier to focus on it. 
---
My best guess as to what you're doing differently, is that you're being paid by Bethesda. Anyone would have a good time then.
---
That seems like the best idea I want the offence obviously but with adrenaline reaction I need to be low hp so want defence too.
---
&gt;Maybe just the trigger animation is bugged?
---
That happens with Super Duper. Animation happens repeatedly after you're done crafting and walk away to do something else.
---
You're right; but what does it matter? Your argument in no way excuses the gross, unacceptable amount of incompetence bethesda has shown to all players, not just the grindiest players. I
---
I've never actually found a helmet in the wild, but the plans spawn pretty consistently for me at Drop Site C2 (on the shelves inside next to a black metal box), Drop Site V9 (but that one's right next to a fissure site so watch out for SBs), and in the orange boxcar just east of the NAR repair yard outside Watoga.
---
Or if you're on PC, I can hook you up. I have extras.
---
When it takes a full clip of a 50 caliber TSE to take a gutsy yeah, its tickling. Melee is OP as hell compared to guns. One shotting enemies left and right and destroying the queen in very few minutes with the right legendaries.
---
they apparently copied the red headlamp file to make the new Mothman lamp but instead of coping the file they replaced the original so now all lamps like this show up as Mothman lamps.
---
Problem is you are ok if it is installed, but if it was a Mod in your inventory you may not had "permission" to install it now.
---
Just leave it and when BETH gets around to fixing their latest buggy hotfix we will have a whole new batch of bugs to complain about.
---
I played for an hour and must of drained 3 cores, and I’m always hungry and thirsty and I have my slow matablizer and water card maxed. They nerf the game. 
---
My guns also got further nurfed
---
Here are three setups:  1) Single Handed - daily runner 2) Two Handed Melee / Power Armor for Nuke Zones 3) Camp / Forage / Trading - all using the same card quantities for SPECIAL
---
I have run solo from day one and can trade out lone wanderer for 4 team charisma cards when needed.
---
Trying to include pics.  Will try and figure out.
---
Yes, it's been crazy.
---
I had a bit hoarded on me, and just noticed it's all gone now.
---
I'm glad you had fun. But you can't deny the overwhelming mountain of evidence that most other people have not.
---
Still wouldn't hurt to have more ammo variations tho 
---
With Whitesprings, you don't actually have to kill the ghouls yourself. Get a scoped weapon with nice range and take one shot from a distance, which will get the ghoul's attention.  Once it starts coming for you, run like hell to an area that is teeming with Whitespring robots.  Keep running (if you're at the main entrance, going up the stairs to the little balcony can be a good idea). Once the ghoul enters the courtyard, the robots will gang up on it and finish it off for you. The nice thing is since you landed a shot on it, you'll still get the experience points from the kill and be able to loot the body when the chaos settles down.  Just make sure not to accidentally shot one of the robots. They hold a grudge and if you mess with one, you mess with them all.
---
It enhances mutations, until you're cured, at which point they're supressed.  Logout/log back in should fix it.
---
I've been playing relatively consistently since Beta, I'm only level 51ish though. I'm all about the exploring over the quests I guess and maybe that's why I'm a lower level.
---
I'm disappointed about my tse guns. I'm sure some of what I have was duped. I haven't paid for any of it however, just have been gifted here and there from lovely people.
---
The better guns made it more enjoyable for me because it felt less stressful and like I could accomplish more by myself. I understand somewhat while they nerfed it but I wish it wasn't so drastic I guess.
---
The carry weight isn't the best however I think it's more immersive that you can't carry a whole ton of shit. What isn't working for me is the current stash limit even though it's been raised to 600 and the camp budget system. I barely have anything in my camp, but the budget is full.  but some stickers on my wall or some stuff like that takes up a huge chunk of the budget so easily
---
I guess you could consider the stash limit to be immersive if you think of your Camp as being a movable settlement ,  only so much you can move around and take with you.
---
The most negative thing I've experienced is the server crashes and things along that line.
---
I haven't experienced anything bad enough to make me put the game down permanently or even more than a day or two.
---
I don't think it's fair to not also listen to the players that have put a lot more time in (and thus high level) because those/we are the people that pre-ordered and paid the maximum amount of money for this game that's now nearly free. That have been here since the beginning and been waiting for the game to be its best.  
---
Creation engine can’t handle that without barfing all over the server.
---
Fo4 had some great f this issue though depending on the npc. I stop using the weapons all together but it would be good if you could scrap ammo.
---
interesting! makes sense
---
adamantium skeleton all day every day

You can find some in the bunkers, and each bunker has its own loot. So if you grab all the lead weights from silo A and scrap them, you can fast travel to B and C to do the same thing. Solo, you can easily run the entire silo in 5-8 minutes depending on your aim and how well you know the processes.
---
This also kinda bugged me
---
Man I gotta say this went above and beyond I think I even (maybe) learned something but thanks for that. 
---
I’m just hoping for small quality of life improvements 
---
Increased stability 
---
Some free dlc and probably some paid dlc at some point 
---
If they add reverse pickpocketing I’ll roll a new stealth guy and never look back.
---
Il à dit:
---
Vous ne pouvez pas le cacher
---
True dat. I really appreciate the players taking their time to spawn a SBQ.
---
Its kinda twosided. If you launch a nuke at the prime site, you need random people to join in the fight(if they contribute) otherwise you wouldnt do shit and on the other side we need those players to launch nukes for us to help them. Win win. Loot still sucks tho.
---
The engine isn't the problem, Bethesda is.
---
Fucking hell, this game is a fucking nightmare.
---
Never played it, never will. Hope you all stop playing it, so all these damn meta and bitch fests stop getting to the front page.
---
It's all good, replace 600 with 200 hours in the original post and the point still stands. 
---
In the early days people were trying to tell other people that budget increases with level. This isn’t true and there’s no way to increase budget, you just need to build smart.
---
They also fixed the duping of certain buildings that let people go over budget.
---
Water for sure. It was draining extremely fast. Every few minutes. How about weapon strength? My lever action kept breaking over and over last night. Before the patch, with my perks I could play an entire day and still be ok, now my gun barely makes it through a wave of low level scorched. 
---
May be not throw it away, that shit could go Jumanji.....
---
I don't think an unexpected error involving the latest patch says a whole lot about where the company is going.  Glitches happen and they have already announced their intention to fix it.  
---
If this is the direction they are going then I plan on continuing to buy the next elder scrolls game they release.  I think they are definitely going in the right direction after fallout 4.  And I do believe that 76 is a massive improvement over fallout 4 in the areas that I care about the most.  They literally got rid of everything I disliked about fallout 4 in 76 - or if not - added enough new material to make me forget my other problems with that game.
---
I enjoyed the game when it first came out - and from my perspective it has improved at a more than acceptable rate - as it has only been out for 2.5 months.
---
Once again - from my perspective - Bethesda has once again released a superior product, and once again has continued with a history of community engagement, and improvement of that product.
---
I applaud the changes they have made and delighted with the change of direction they have made following what I saw were major mis-steps in their last excellent product, fallout 4.
---
Do I worry that negative responses from the community will cripple the game?  Yes I do.  Do I have enough evidence to support the belief that this will occur?  No I do not - I have heard only anecdotal evidence concerning the financial success of the game.
---
If I could hope for one thing it would be that Bethesda continues to improve this game and that following games will continue along the trajectory set by it - so that I can continue to enjoy one of the few developers that seems to value what I value in a game.
---
I can confirm I got a legendary 1\* meat hook/pole hook (can't remember the name) from killing her yesterday, which was awesome. 
---
Oops, did we say "25%?" Accidentally coded that at .00025%, will fix in the next major patch in a month. Probably.
---
Reminds me of an old, probably half-century or older at this point, joke.
---
What do you call someone that speaks multiple languages? Multilingual.
---
What do you call someone that only speaks one language? American.
---
I dunno, I don't think I will. I never even got through all the Skyrim DLC. I did love Skyrim though. I played SOME oblivion. I won't be there with my preorder, but if I hear really good things about the game, I'll probably pick it up like a year later after it's been patched better.
---
There are also things called Cryolators. I never really used one but apparently it slows the opponent down.
---
After four server disconnects in a half hour this morning, I wouldn't mind this one bit.
---
Same! I love tall buildings. The most floors I've been able to get was 7. 
---
&gt; The casual average player never had a TSE weapon to be nerfed. 
---
As a casual player, I have two two-shot (not explosive) weapons that I rely on to do any decent amount of damage and conserve ammo so I don't spend half my game time hunting lead and steel. I'm pretty damn miffed about the two-shot nerf.  
---
Like, cool. Now Joe Bloggs who spends ten hours a day playing FO76 can't one shot little Jimmy who only plays for an hour after school, but now little Jimmy can't do any meaningful damage to the scorch beast queen because all his perks are in fun stuff that makes him actually enjoy that hour each day.
---
yet another post that completely overlooks the disaster that was last patch, focusing on TSE and perk nerfs. There are plenty that are upset over those, but this patch was all around dog shit. the patch prior to this one had my game running smooth as butter for the most part (X1X). This patch reverted my game to a state it hasn't been in for over a month. I am crashing regularly again, highly populated areas and dense locations like cities and whitesprings get extremely choppy and i lose frames like crazy. I  regularly freeze in the middle of combat. There is plenty wrong with this patch that goes beyond nerfs, and to brush it off like its just elitism is ridiculous and irresponsible. I have been cutting Bethesda slack from the start and defending them left and right, but come on man. the game has been out for almost a full quarter, and they are still making bullshit mistakes that ruins the experience for *millions* of players. quit trying to undermine legitimate concerns because your subjective experience is acceptable to you.
---
i haven't played since the hotfix, so i cant speak on the current state, but there legitimately something wrong with the people that think that nothing was wrong with the last patch. I literally saw comments saying that it was the "best patch yet," which is objectively bullshit. this sub has been a cesspool of incessant posts from extremists on both sides. some idiot writes a rage letter about how he is quitting, then another idiot feels the need to write an apologist post telling us we should be cupping Howard's balls while we deep throat him. each post is as ignorant and irresponsible as the other, just as this one is.
---
Know more people having the same problem, didn't they fix it yet?
---
&gt; There's things I want for this game too: player vending
---
Yep, that would be nice. What's sad is that there was a player vending machine in the E3 video I think. 
---
Are you comparing playing video games to reading classic literature?
---
You are ridiculous, but I really appreciated the joke.
---
It's not a 'net gain' scenario. Someone made a claim and I disproved it by merely existing. You don't make their claim suddenly back to being true by not agreeing--I'm still here.
---
Or just add a timer.  No need to try and get fancy with it.  
---
Accidentally reworked stash size to 60 instead of 600 but due to server lag with all the extra items, anything above that 60 pounds was scrapped.
---
I'm as casual as you can get. Bought it at launch, and I'm not even level 40 yet. The game hasn't gotten better, and the quality of the current build is still pretty embarrassing. 4 months is far too long to fix a broken game. Granted, No Man's Sky managed to turn it around and that took far longer, but I feel that by the time Bethesda gets their shit together, this game will be dead. It's already a meme at this point. I hope they turn it around, I really do, but right now it's the laughing stock of the games industry. 
---
Stop posting these generic posts trying to dig upvotes. 
---
The most recent patch stemmed from an earlier build, perhaps they went back to before the patch that stated 'Dark areas will look lighter now' (Yes, that was in a patch info) and forgot to re-introduce it? Personally I haven't noticed, but I have not played much since the patch.
---
^This
---
I agree, they’d be perfect if I could wear silly hats with them.
---
It's not a good thing. You need to hurt the ghouls anyway to get xp. I would even be okay with ppl rounding them up and bringing them to a turret camp a little bit further down on the golfcurse but the 2 story buildings with rocket turrets shoting inside the clubhouse  just steal kills and kill the framerate 
---
no, according to OP, if you are affected by bugs from the last patch, you're an elitist.
---
Now listen here you degenerate **hater**. This game has only been out for *3 months* and they have had a big holiday period in the middle of it. Why are you so **entitled** that you think they should just fix everything right here and right now. I'll have you know that Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing was *way worse* than this game when it released so how about you get some perspective and be thankful for what Bethesda has given you?
---
^^/s
---
If you’re always pushing the weight limit it’s probably your aid and ammo. When I’m starting to max I’ll realize I’m carrying 40 water, 50 stimpacks, and 30 rad-x. 
---
And 50 missiles 
---
I've been having this issue as well and all i do is wait around the area for long enough and sure enough the meat pile spawns in with the same loot only just a few meters away. so dont give up! keep looking around!
---
Had various bugs hit me till it was just unplayable. 
---
Support just kept telling me the next update will fix that.  
---
I still technically have the character but the last time i tried loading it, it took something stupid like 20minutes to load just for the game to crash 
---
Maybe he's trying to create that player hub people are asking for.
---
Don’t get the point of this post? You aren’t having these issues so are you accusing others of lying or what?
---
PS4

Seem to be benefiting from The "Strange in Numbers" perk even when it's not equipped.
---
My Marsupial mutation jump is higher than it should be without that card equipped.
---
I typically don't use that perk card as I don't like the weird stutter in the jumping physics with the higher jump.
---
Sadly, this game isn't about sneaking. I mean, I wish it were. I enjoyed sneaking through the Forest and other low levels. But eventually, sneaking doesn't do the trick. You can't sneak your way through a nuke zone full of ghouls. You might be able to get off the occasional sneak crit against the SBQ, depending, but you'll only be successful if there are a good number of other players distracting the endless spawns.
---
I mean, don't get me wrong - I hope your issue is addressed in a way that doesn't piss you off. I'm just cynical about it and so I stopped trying to sneak a while ago when I realized the game doesn't want you to sneak.
---
I'm level 210, playing since the B.E.T.A. Its been a bug fest.
---
Top kek.
---
Sometimes I wish I understood others perspectives better and sometimes I'm glad that I don't.
---
I'll probalby get a little bored when I run out the story as well - but I still have most of the BOS questline left to do and I haven't done any Nuke Silos yet.  
---
I spend a lot of time exploring the map, hunting, and looking for stories in ruins - that keeps me engaged.
---
I like that the game doesn't try to rush you through the story - that was a big turnoff for me from some of the more recent Beth-games.
---
You’re already drinking from the fountain - why not just make use of the facilities to repair some weapons, cook up a meal, take a nap and get well tuned?  Also it’s BS that every time there’s a camp there - it’s more like 1 in 10 servers.
---
Just a suggestion - I don’t camp there but have often stopped by just to use the facilities.
---
This is one of the biggest reasons we need a player hub of some kind.  I used to craft in WoW with various characters, especially once you could put enchantments on vellum so that you could sell that as a consumable, and this is the kind of thing that would really benefit FO76.
---
Especially given the increase in cost to recipes.  If their hotfix notes indicate that they want to encourage player trading, then there should be an in-game way to facilitate this process.
---
That's good to know.  I never liked how mine was just parked outside my house, and for some reason, I never figured that moving it was an option.
---
Dunno if this of any help but me and a friend were at Harper's ferry vendor, he said there was a heavy combat leg plan so I looked and there wasn't, he looked again and it showed the plan but again wouldn't show for myself.
---
And before anyone says anything about levels, both me and my friend were LVL 77 at the time
---
Yes i will do that just havent gotten around to it yet. 
---
LOL, can this train wreck get any worse? 
---
it would simply be a use for other bottles.
---
there's almost no use for glass, currently.
---
They're partying with Ruth Ginsberg
---
This was mentioned in another post.  The Serendipity perk card in the Luck tree.  I have level three of it.  It either proc's late or not at all.  I don't think it's working correctly.  It pops up in the time between dying and respawning.  Sometimes it spams over and over after respawning.  Xbox One X.  Greyhound87
---
The queen should stick around until she's killed or the nuke zone goes away
---
No, because most doors were locked.
---
This is the third post I have read about this. This is unbelievably shit. Here is one other post on it:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alyel9/auto\_scrap\_bulk\_now\_works\_why\_would\_you\_scrap\_bulk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alyel9/auto_scrap_bulk_now_works_why_would_you_scrap_bulk/)
---
Maybe i got mine since i refunded right away. 
---
Which are things every mmo goes through? WoW, GW2, BDO all had near the same things happen when they first released. Things can be improved but it's finding a balance first. 
---
This is beyond science
---
If you're going to make a post called "fact-checking" you probably shouldn't make statements like
---
&gt; Nothing will ever take away the **fact** that this is an excellent game.
---
That's not a fact, that's a subjective opinion, do you know what facts are?
---
I think people just wanted it to work like it did before, which was nice: bulked scrap would be automatically used for crafting, but would stay bulked if you hit "scrap all junk" because what's the fucking point of scrapping bulk scrap. That way you can craft all you need and sell excess bulk to vendors. 
---
I am trying to download a couple of pics of my setups and am failing miserably. If you want me to email them to you I can or tell me how to do it via this conversation. Thanks 
---
The vendor caps issue is the one I literally hate. Shared caps and only 200c total.
---
I can't sell shit.  😓
---
Nope.
---
I should have clarified, I was aware of that. This was a thrown explosive.
---
Lolz for someone who talks a lot about what he feels entitled to, you still play.
---
Most mature folks woulda moved on.
---
Nope not you..
---
You’re the troll who can’t and won’t let go..
---
You call everyone you know having a great time with this game, a fanboy.
---
I call you and other haters, stalkers. 
---
Stalking and Hanging out in sub bushes, in sub porches, like some voyeur, envious and angry folks are having a great time in a game you profess to hate, but still play.
---
How dare Bethesda not care about my feelings. #myfeelingsmatter damn you!
---
Thanks for the laffs.
---
This isn't a new bug, it's been in the game since the beta. It just doesn't get enough attention to be seen by a community manager.
---
Ranged sneak damage is still bugged when around other players, shooting enemies in sneak does the same thing that explosive weapons did before they were patched: enemies "heal" back the bonus damage from sneak.
---
we had this happen last night!  
---
It went way way way off to the mountain range.  and flying VERY high in the sky, out of vats range.  We ended up having someone move their base, and build stairways to heaven so we could still shoot it.
---
We did end up succeeding, but because it was so far away, not in range, we didn't get the question success rewards!
---
Because the second actually sells I supose.
---
That was a refrigerator.
---
That's just a lame tactic, instead flip the switch on them pull out a rifle and add perforating mags and tank killer and start an armor piercing revolution
---
Maybe the difference is shilling.
---
The problem with shooting yourself in the foot all the time is that you quickly run out of feet to shoot
---
Cool? 
---
Ok thanks! 
---
I will give that a try next time.
---
Maybe you are just a regular gamer playing the game and not trying to "beat" the game ?
---
yep had that ealier on ps4
---
yea, since the update, i'm so thirsty all the time!
---
also my guns are breaking way faster. 
---
Sneaking nuke zones is no problem whitesprings etc. Literally do it all the time. SBQ isnt bad either unless there are a lot of extra SB around. Then its iffy if you can maintian your caution. Other than that you can use stealth 100% the rest of the world pvp and pve. 
---
I don't know how many times i sneak headshot a wanted player or one taking my workshop with my levered action rifle, with smug satisfaction. Or cleaned out a camp with mobs in it effortlessly. Stealth worked. And was working until this last patch.
---
&gt; are you ok? the very fact I wrote "OBJECTIVELY" denotes that I'm not talking about subjective things.
---
Not when you don't specify.  Words don't have magic, made up meanings.  They have real meanings.  If you had stated "The game's development is objectively not good", then your use of objectively is correct.  But you qualified the game as a whole.  I can't read your mind.  I can't infer what mean without context.  You are trying to add context that was't there to not have to admit you messed up how you wanted to say something, and now you are just reply to reply out of some primitive "fight or flight" reaction.
---
 Look at this example:
---
    I saw a squirrel riding my bike in the park.
---
What does that sentence mean?  Well, obviously to the author of that sentence, it means that when he was riding his bike in the park, he saw a squirrel.  However, the way the sentence is written, it can mean that while he was in the park, he saw a squirrel riding his bike.  This is what your initial comment was.  It made sense to you, but was written poorly.
---
&gt; for example: objectively, the graphics are not good and the PR is worse, abysmal. I could list other things but I believe that's enough.
---
YES!!! Thats it!!! Specificity!!  You are talking about a specific aspect and not the product as a whole!  You get it!
---
&gt; you want me to measure just how much the graphics suck or the PR is messing up? because that's more work than it's worth.
---
No.  In your initial comment, you signified the game as a whole was "objectively not good" without any qualifying context.  That is my objection.
---
It surpressed mine multiple times last night.
---
Up until now Diluted rad-x has NEVER done that.
---
What the fuck is the point if diluting it then???
---
Spoiler alert: turns out, nah. They didn't test it. 
---
Your windmill just glitched through the floor. No loot for you.
---
You are expecting a fully polished multiplayer experience from the get go. And I'm sorry to say but that has never and will never be a thing. Every game starts out kinda clunky then over time gets better. 
---
And to a degree you are acting a little too high brow. This is a relatively new studio doing all the multiplayer aspects. It will get better over time but this is still a young game.
---
I'd like a basment type structure for my camp that I could put bunkbeds and a decontamination shower down there, just so when building a camp I don't have an extra room building out the side or on top of my regular living/crafting quarters
---
Well part of the reason for this was an experience similar to yours. Someone had mentioned getting a heavy combat chest set at Watoga and I've never seen it there. The list I posted has been consistent for me throughout.
---
Thing is though, is it a level thing? Platform thing? A bug? Rather than rely on hearsay, I wanted to use solid data to confirm one way or the other.
---
Thanks for your comment. Will be curious to see how this all plays out.
---
Ah... thank you! I found mention of radworms. It's even worse, because it doubles the effect of the card that increases explosion radius! That's what happened... I have the +100% radius card and was hit by the oversized blast, which was augmented twice as much as expected by the (nerfed) demolition expert effect.
---
Consider that on PS4, it's possible to not own the game and to not get out of the vault if you've borrowed it. So it's also arguable that many of those trophy holders don't even own or play the game regularly.
---
It's all good. My favorite was when I came across a reddit post about someone complaining about a description being inaccurate on an item. One of the devs responded, we can't change it because we don't know what it will break... 
---
I'm not even level 40 yet and I agree with you. This game is a meme at this point and I really don't know if I can force myself to keep playing it when there are so many other, better games to be playing. 
---
Sutton station, Sugar Grove, Flatwoods(a bit spread out), most restaurants, diners and bars, Valley Galleria, any and all moonshiner/liquor still location, etc. Oh and a lot of Raider locations have beer bottles too.
---
I do agree it’s silly they didn’t make it require just glass.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGBqxjzcHyw&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
I always thought they should be nuka cola bottles since that's their icon in the weapons wheel.
---
I wouldn't say I have as good an experience as that but, on PC, I have relatively few crashes or bug out.
---
I'd say a CTD every second day, 2 elastic spaghetti dogs ever and most annoyingly in the last 2 days a bit of damage regen server lag. I'm happy enough with performance ( on a comparative scale) but I'm getting a tad bored now. Level 161 and running out of things to do and not mad about a second respecc grind to go heavy guns 
---
It is.. But you will suffffer for it. You are much better off making some buddies. You dont need em with you all the time, but when you have a difficult time with a new area or want to launch a nuke, friends are a great help. At least untill you've gotten strong enough to do it on your own.
---
If you dont have any that play the game, dont worry. Just make sure you have a mic and you'll run into friendly people at some point.
---
If it doesn't matter, why argue it?
---
And I wasn't alive centuries ago. I, a male, shouldn't be punished in the name of "equality."
---
Sexism will continue as long as you SJW's push this bs agenda. 
---
I'm hoping for the latter. 
---
I wasn't trying to refute the point of the post, but I've seen many people here very vocally claiming to have spent that kind of time, and at the very least most of them are lying. If someone is lying about something so trivial to give themselves false credit, then what else are they lying about? That's my point.
---
"every time I go there there are so many ghouls at levels 60+ - I don't stand a chance. I turned up once and they were only level 22"
---
Levels of creatures can vary depending on the level of the person who most recently entered the area, so if you can in right after a level 60 you re going to see higher level spawns.  So know you know once you get out of the Forest you might need to scout a bit before you commit to walking into a location, make sure you are well stocked with stimpaks before entering a new area, and you should be prepared to run away at any time.  You can get away with not doing that in the Forest area, but once you move out you need to prepare and recon a bit more before committing yourself.  White Springs can be tricky because there are areas where only one or two spawn and lures you into thinking you can power through, then you get hit with a swarm and you are DEAD.  There are other places like this.  AS you level up the content gets more challenging and you have to up your game.  If you are still having issues then you are liekly either underleveled for that area, or you need more time to learn the capabilities of your perks/equipment so you can get the most out of them.  
---
Scorchbeasts are hard to deal with because they fly and their attacks make them hard to see, and they generate/summon additional mobs to attack you.  You have to be able to move around to force those mobs to move so they do not corner you and keep firing at you uninterrupted and the beast.  Not having power armor makes it hard to deal with multiple mobs, especially if you can't kite them and use trees or buildings to screen from their attacks.  Sometimes the beast will land and attack you, especially if you kill the adds and there is open ground.  Killing scorchbeasts is an endurance contest, you have to have armor/weapons in good condition at the start and have stimpaks and ammo a plenty.  If the encounter is not in your favor you need to run away or in the worst circumstances relog.
---
Good luck.
---
Holy shit they can't get anything right can they?
---
I'm entirely convinced they outsourced this game to India. 
---
Radiation.
---
I don't buy into this whole dollars per hours thing at all, it's complete nonsense. Going to a movie, bar, restaurant, etc is not comparable. 
---
By that logic, why even game at all? Read a book instead. You'll get far far greater *dollar per hour* ratio from doing that than playing any game at all.
---
I feel like people who make the *dollars per hour* comparison are just trying to justify their purchase to themselves. Do they apply this same metric to all their entertainment purchases? Doubt it. This argument only seems to pop up for gaming, and when that game is getting slammed for either lack of content, critical flaws, or both.
---
I stopped reading the minute you wrote entitlement. 
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with being upset about paying for a game that is incomplete and barely works for some people. You've spent money on a product with the very reasonable expectation that it "just works". And when it doesn't? You're completely entitled to complain about that.
---
“Molotov’s now require empty vodka bottles to be in line with the graphic. Due to the fact there are much fewer empty vodka bottles compared to beer bottles, we are doing the following to address that: be aware of the issue.”
---
Would love it to be a heavy gun honestly instead of a rifle. 
---
Don't get me started on disappearing mobs, went to Whitespring after a nuke I guess and got mobbed by a couple dozen bloated glowing ferals, first my guns stopped doing damage, then my 200% Grognak's Axe broke after 4 kills and after I had dealt with them I had 3 bodies to search and no meat piles in site.
---
Did you know if you use the camera to take a photo of something that is predominately purple you won't be able to paint it to a canvas/flag because the game's code has two different entries for purple coloring? Photos taken with the camera register it as the one that doesn't occur ingame and can only be spawned by an admin, not the one you craft in a cooker/pot. Just discovered this last weekend, I'd say Beth and WildCard are running neck and neck.
---
This would be nice.  Or revise Scrapper to allow people to potentially get rare materials when scrapping, or even make Scrapper like Super Duper and potentially double the results from scrapping.
---
Their "Inside the Vault" from yesterday at least indicates they're looking at repair costs, which tracks with the patch notes from January 10th.  But it would be nice if they'd also tweak a perk to potentially make gathering materials a bit more efficient and not as time consuming.
---
Thank you for reporting this, we'll look into it!
---
Proximity fuse missiles that deal less damage but have a larger blast radius and deal much more limb damage
---
I always thought the martial arts the increased the crank speed because it requires you to crank you have fast hands your crank faster.
---
I will help tonight when I get out of work and do my Vendor run.
---
It's been very bothersome for me.  Cause I really want to finish my Heavy Combat Armor plans (and Sturdy, but those are just for me wanting to be a completionist).
---
Heavy Legs and Sturdy Torso were on sale day one at Watoga.  And Nothing at HF.  I haven't see any Heavy or Sturdy Combat plans (base, not mods) since.
---
At the very least it gives me time to gather up the caps to be prepped for when I do see them.  And I guess I finally got a Handmade plan so that good?
---
I really wanna drop these Deep Pocketed Heavy Leather for some Deep Pocketed BOS Heavy Combat Armor though.
---
That's what I thought! It's why I always used diluted instead
---
You’re absolutely right. 
---
This, after the pip-boy freeze you'll get a second loading screen and the game will load in properly in my experience.
---
Annoying, yes, but not game breaking
---
moderation and logic is not as acclaimed in this sub as extremist posts featuring whining, hyperbole, and misinformation, unfortunately. 
---
Personally, I like the bobby pin fix
---
Post up a shot of your build, curious to see how you have the perks setup.  
---
There was. It had it's own build menu.
---
Does that make you immune to perk effects that cripple like Enforcer as well?
---
Thanks for confirming. Gotta love having to relog everytime you forget now lol.
---
I think here "I will pass this to the dev team" mail go into the dev teams spam folder
---
You guys rock, keep it up :) 
---
Even worse when you fast travel after spending 30+caps to have it never activate or it timed out during the loading screen 
---
It seems like a good team quest. I was waiting for my team mates to join me before doing the quest. We'll still do the quest, but without the fusion generator plans as an incentive I'll probably push this to the bottom of the pile.
---
No, I never accused anyone of lying.  The point of this post is that I am genuinely curious as to what would cause such vastly different gaming experiences.  Nothing nefarious at all intended in my comments.
---
Click on my name, there should be four options and the one a the bottom says “send a message” and click on it.
---
My BE black powder rifle dealt 1.8 k dmg pre patch and my ts mini nuke launcher dealt 880 hmm
---
I guess what they're trying to say is that the arguments against it are meaningless because people were hoodwinked into paying the retail price, and that's all Bethesda needed to cover the costs of making the game?
---
Brilliant. I can focus on a delicate and precision demanding task while my HPs are being rearranged by a rocket powered hammer.
---
*Slow clap*
---
I don't think so... but at the same time, if I were running some kind of misinformation campaign, I'd probably learn a lot from how YouTubers and social media in general could ignite a mob mentality against a single game.
---
I mean, back in the day, when we didn't like a game, we just didn't play it.  Now, it's like a holy crusade to crucify anyone who dares to like it.
---
Thanks for the report! I'll bring this up with the team this morning.
---
So...you're mad the hotfix wasn't a release of new content? Or the only thing you take away from the last few patches to fix major bugs and issues were bobby pin weight?
---
Honestly explosives weren't the issue,  it was just very specifically TSE.
---
I've never bothered with the Missile Launcher and Fat Man because they take up so much space, ammo is heavy,  and they do nothing. 
---
Explosives have always sucked, they're so out of touch with their own game. 
---
People internalize the branding. It's not about the game anymore it's about the franchise. People identify themselves with the franchise so criticism of the game becomes criticism of them personally. They take it as a personal attack and so they defend the franchise zealously. It's not enough that they enjoy it, knowing that other people don't enjoy it somehow diminishes their own enjoyment so they seem to take criticism personally.
---
Movies have gone the same way, just look at all the controversy over the last jedi and other new star wars movies. Some star wars fans take criticism of the new movies as personal attacks.
---
&gt;but I'm my explosive build
---
Sorry for your loss
---
&gt;I honestly don't understand how you can admit this and then basically tell people their complaints are full of shit.
---
exactly. what idiot wastes money gilding this shit?
---
Didn‘t read everything - by your logic tough Bethesda is catering to the wrong ppl tough. The 10hours played average dude doesn’t buy cosmetics in the ingame shop - the 760 hours played dude most likely did.
---
Hi! Thanks for the reports on this. Have noted a few other threads on this as well and am bringing it up in a meeting this morning.
---
That is fantastic to hear and Thanks, now if I can get only get Bethesda to start taking us seriously and stop ignoring our feedback!
---
It's kind of hilarious. There are a few BASIC things needed for the scrapping system to work correctly: 
---
* Any item can be MANUALLY scrapped
---
* Junk is autoscrapped EITHER while crafting OR hitting "scrap all junk"
---
* Bulked scrap is autoscrapped for crafting but NOT when hitting "scrap all junk" 
---
* Mods are NEVER autoscrapped for ANY reason
---
Bethesda is literally incapable of fixing one of these without breaking one of the others. It's amazing. 
---
I didn’t see what system or specs you are running. How would anyone truly help? This is never happened to me once. Or is this just toxic bitching again?
---
Sorry, I was not trying to say sneaking was stupid. But right now, the entire endgame for FO76 is mob rushes or SBQ farming, neither of which are built for sneaking. Sure, you can make it work. But that's like the guy who goes to the SBQ with nothing more than melee. He can make it work, but he shouldn't be relying upon it.
---
That's what I meant. If you have fun sneaking, then more power to you. I just didn't have the opinion that sneaking was a serious consideration for the devs when I watch my teammates plow through hordes of folks faster than I could tag them sometimes while sneaking.
---
I just went to bed for for 5% XP, then I couldn't jump high after waking up. It really sucks.
---
Used a load to make ultracite lasers for mod scrapping. Built a fully tricked out one, was trash, was sad.
---
&gt;In the early days people were trying to tell other people that budget increases with level. 
---
I remember something like that. And something about linking your camp up with your teammates. 
---
Were these just rumors, or did someone say that?
---
A terrible point to make, and one that willfully ignores the issues that are being discussed.
---
This guy is too used to Ark 
---
The didn't tell us we would get a game with countless bugs, we expected it but they never said that
---
&gt;I don't care about regression defects. Fix important shit that I care about instead of operational failures
---
- Someone who has no understanding of computer program development.
---
Should have at least increased the amount of vendor caps available and/or increased the refresh rate to vendor caps.
---
At the very least they can let us rename items,  like in Fo4.
---
Even if it was exclusively client side and nobody else can see the name but you,  it would help a TON.
---
Paparoach
---
Can you point me to where the frequent crashes were advertised? I can't seem to find that in any of the ads or trailers. Thanks I await your results.
---
hey bethesda. in game surveys
---
Peace bro ✌
---
Yes, and it seems to happen most when there are more enemies (large Mobs) I kill 5 or 6 but can only find 2 or 3.
---
Also many Legendary enemies not dropping loot,
---
My friends dont play this game anymore though because theyre tired of disconnects :(
---
I think the game tells you not to fight a hoard of super mutants by having your HP bar  drop rapidly. Colonel Gutsy demonstrated this for me several times as well. 
---
I like that the game doesn't hold your hand too much in that respect, but there aren't many quests in the forest for players who focus on questing. The main quests send new players into the savage divide before they're sufficiently leveled or equipped. 
---
Honestly, same here.  She's not worth it as the current loot tables have her drop stuff I already have.  And since her legendary drops are the same as any other 3* legendary, it makes no sense to kill her over Wes-Tek's Supermutants, or Whitespring's Ghouls.
---
Yup. It's really frustrating. 
---
Yeah but name one other AAA that let modders touch an active mmo source. (Not Lua modding that wouldn't help) Xbox and PS4 would need separate coding and Bethesda would have to check all code up and down because some asshat would make a shiny grabber just cause.
---
i wouldn't mind one way or the other, honestly if it went heavy it would give me a reason to play and grind out perk changes. It does seem to fit more with the rifles due to overall modability, however.
---
Lol. It was a joke dude. Chill. 
---
Why always nerf ? And what about buff instead ? Buff balistics ? Buff energy ? Buff fatman and missile/grenade launchers ?
---
What about making other S.P.E.C.I.A.L. have effect on weapons damages like strengh on melee, for example perception on rifles and shotguns, agility on pistols, intelligence on energy.
---
Please suggest something smart instead of just nerfing everything...
---
Fully agree! 
---
I know explosives werent the issue but bethesda nerfed it anyway. That's the point of this because no one ever used those because they were too god damned heavy and the ammo damage did diddly squat, with different load out with some actually useful, people might actually start using them 
---
&gt; Edit: I'm level 57 and on PS4. Not super high but seems they should all be available above 50, plus I already saw Heavy Combat Legs. 
---
I'm thinking the same thing in terms of level 50 but it could just as easily open up more plans at higher levels. Barring a dev or community manager stepping in to give us the answer, this is the next best thing for now.
---
Thanks for your help. Look forward to the result :)
---
Imagine calling someone delusional because they have a different opinion than you. How insecure do you have to be?
---
Muh grind isnt optimal *sometimes* 
---
So lets punish people who dont have turret camps and keep their camp 100 yards safely away from the club house. 
---
Just smash the camp if you dont want the turrets messing up your grind. Be a man. 
---
Instead you make a wussy thread and bitch about it on reddit. Lol
---
You have all the tools to not be bothered for more than 30 seconds. Smash the camp or server hop.
---
&gt;Yes, reverting back to old bugs in the patch was real bad. Yes, I am annoyed that my bulked items don't auto scrap. it harms game QoL. but they are fixing it. It never should of happened, but it is getting fixed.  
---
&gt;And yes, this is a really sloppy job of running a game. I have played ALOT of games in my old age (dinosaur age in reddit years) A lot of online games. A lot of console games.... and I can't think of one off the top of my head that has been as rocky and meandering as this one...  
---
&gt;But, I will still say that Bethesda took huge steps towards stabilizing the game in this patch.
---
This should go into the DSM-V entry for Stockholm Syndrome.
---
By removing the things that stress the server, I'm pretty sure it *is* more stable.
---
Of course, it's also quieter.  There appear to be fewer players on every server I've been on.  The Queen isn't worth fighting so you don't have that enormous battle happening all the time.  And Bethesda has taken away the incentive to server hop, so there's probably less coming-and-going of players in general.
---
Well it's certainly more efficient than just letting them mow down ghouls with no gain for anyone and saves ammo &amp; repairs
---
Scrapping ammo would be amazing
---
All I want to do is play some FO, but everyone I try and connect I get in then it says server disconnected it's 2018 since when have we got struggling servers ffs
---
Super Concur
---
Could Auto Grenade Launchers be fixed to be added back to the Bear Arms perk card? I love these things but at 23 pounds each and the rate they break it kinda sucks.
---
Lol. You're trolling right? Why are those hot fixes needed? Because they pushed out an old version of the game by mistake. Thats staggeringly incompetent, even given the litany of previous errors and bugs. Engagement? There is documented proof that they are deleting threads off of the forums that highlight the issues. That's not engagement, that's censorship, because even "hardcore" fans are waking up to the reality that Bethesda are terrible at this shit. You guys deserve each other.
---
No, bethesda can say it was an illegal chargeback since they did provide a service. Chargebacks are meant only for fraud and situations as such. Ask your bank.
---
I hope they are more stable! Really hope it isn't because of less traffic. I was disappointed with the balancing of tse, but I dont want to see the game fail just because it is no more fun for me.
---
I'd also like to point out all of the weapons you listed sacrifice something for damage
---
Range - shotguns and black powder weapons
---
Reload - some shotguns all black powder and lever action now
---
Accuracy - shotguns
---
Useability - black powder and Gauss
---
Fire rate - blackpowder, some shotguns and Gauss.
---
This is what I'm trying to get across, and this is why some guns hit much harder than others, they sacrifice something for damage iether the safety of being at range or they take ages to reload. The combat rifle is general use, kinda like a combat rifle should be it's a jack of all master of none, and because of that every single person thinks it's bad because it doesn't hit like a Gauss or shotgun which tbh is stupid as hell.
---
II THINK IT's just server lag...
---
True, thematically fits heavy guns though. I mean, people would be happy if it benefited from anything, i would think about respeccing cause of it. 
---
Ah that sucks. But thank you for the information!
---
Welcome to fallout.  Grab a ticket and get in the complaint line. 
---
Oh dang didn't know that one. I always considered the camera and photos to be too expensive. So I never bothered with them
---
OMFG, why is it that anytime someone mentions that they are having a positive experience, someone almost always says, "You're being paid by Bethesda."  This is such a common occurence that I honestly considered putting "And no, I am not being paid by Bethesda" in my initial post.
---
Maybe *you* are being paid by Blizzard or Steam to haunt the FO76 subreddit and sow discontent. 
---
Just rumours. Probably people who used the level up exploit to go from level 23 to 200 and during that time, made a change to their base that they forgot about or a glitch deleted stuff in their camp and they though the budget increased.
---
What's your point? People aren't disappointed because the game isn't tailor-made for them but because old bugs reappeared, perks that made the game less tedious got nerfed, and all of this is just the last knot on a string of mishap after mishap.
---
I'm sure that Bethesda is doing what they can but jumping to their defense at this point seems foolish to me, hold them accountable for their fuckups instead of dismissing it or making it seem like it was just a teensy mistake, help them by telling them what they did wrong and what is that brings you enjoyment out of this game, for most people it clearly wasn't farming, and they voiced their opinions. What's wrong with being disappointed with those changes? Just because those reddit dwellers aren't representative of the mainstream casual audience their opinions aren't valid?
---
I agree, fallout 76 It is an empty container It can give much more, right now it's so boring. being high level is a punishment Needs content, npcs, missions, etc. the map is very big, I like it, but also very empty there is an exceeding of dead zones 
---
I’m sure they’re taking note of a lot of things, but everyone has bosses and they’ll be limiting what can be announced, The devs fixing this game are probably a handful of people from one of the small sub-studios, not enough experience or resources cos BGS’s main team will be working on Starfield.
---
This game is going to take a long while to get fixed :( 
---
Quests and events give them away for free, not to mention containers that spawn them.
---
If there were a way to turn them into caps more easily then suddenly all those missiles and mininukes that get left behind are getting picked up.
---
My marsupial was not working 100%. I had to log in /out to get it to work
---
wait there is nuka dark?
---
I am a casual gamer myself, I don't know how much I've played but I only reached level 47 in the past couple of days.
---
It's hard to enjoy a game when you get disconnected, or you get overencumbered because you don't want to lose that really good weapon or armour you've just found.
---
My main issues are how quests themselves get bugged like a part of the BoS questline has you going to Charleston, me and a friend experienced the same bugs (We completed on seperate servers) I would love to complete a mission in the easiest way possible without having to close the game and reload just to get my next waypoint.
---
Another quest me and 2 friends attempted yesterday.... We had to go into a mine to follow a trail, we enter with no issues, however, 2 minutes after entering, we were set upon by 30 or so Scorched, (they had previously completed this quest with no issues like this an hour before) When we were battling, the sound of a SB can be heard overhead and the acid or gas that it spreads was coming into the mine and causing damage
---
How can we play a game fairly when things like this happen?
---
How can we have a good time when our friends disappear from our view on the same server?
---
How can we continue when every item is going to make us overencumbered?
---
These issues are not just QoL, they're issues that issues that effect gameplay.
---
Yes, the auto scrapping issue was annoying, but it was sorted fairly quickly (thanks Bethesda team)
---
If you raise issues about the game, then do so and stop complaining en mass about the lack of content that's about, I'm happy with what's here, there's many stories to follow and I'm always finding new and interesting information that leads me elsewhere to find more info.
---
Sorry for the long rant and thanks for reading if you got this far
---
Yeah definitely not like that’s a small part of it or anything. Let’s pretend it’s the focus so we can be shitty to someone we disagree with!
---
What platform are you on?
---
That would require me using literally 200-400 materials which is more than i even have space for in my bank. Did make 30 meals, 1400 rounds and smelted 20 ore and bulked about 6 things and make 10 stimpacks in less than 5 minutes to test. Guess whos still here!
---
I believe it's a Luck thing according to another post I read, and here's the kicker, it's inverted. The OP said he and his wife are near the same level, he has a high luck build and her's is minimal luck. At the bunker he was never able to get the X-01 mods calibrated shocks or jetpack but she had them show up 3 and 5 times respectively. I have a 12 luck and if anyone knows a de-buff for it I would love to know to test MODUS and other vendors, alternatively a player with really low luck and as many buffs as possible to help. I considered starting a second character but don't feel like leveling all over again. I also am on PC and would be more then willing to help you out, I play for a good part of the day, roughly 9am est to evening. Trillian69 on PC.
---
That happened to me pre patch. We got her to land once then she just flew away. You could see her on the map but could not “go that way”
---
I think Grahm still has them
---
Bethesda making it easier to stop having fun since 2018.
---
I have a two shot combat rifle with 12 perception points allocated to rifleman, and level 91 Deathclaw is literally no problem for me at all.
---
All under one magazine.
---
Yyyaaassss and how about DLC all these people upset about weapons hurting them, cry to Bethesda till they nerf, next cry about armor. If end game players had more to do they wouldn't come after you
---
Only if the launcher gets a persistent bounty for every camp owner whose camp is destroyed.
---
Just imagine it, some lvl 1 fresh out of the vault gets their first camp set up and somebody nukes it. 3 months later they have finally tracked down the one who launched it and go full Inigo Montoya on them "You nuked my CAMP, prepare to die"
---
Hi! I know some of you feel like us CMs are a broken record saying we're passing info along, but I'm still going to say thank you for your reports because they actually are very helpful and we do appreciate them. Either way I'm documenting this and will be bringing it up in a meeting this morning. Thanks!
---
You say that assuming everyone here has purchased the game, and there isn’t anyone just here to join the circlejerk.
---
go to raider train station vendor by top of the world, that asshole had them yesterday.
---
I hate this plan location update, fucking easymode....
---
Is that in department B or C?
---
At least that many play on PS4 alone. 
---
Bethesda nuked the sub one too many times and now the Scorchbeasts roam wild and free. 
---
You sure it was level 12 and not 120-something?  Yellow (Excavator) armor can't be worn by anyone under 25.
---
No not really. If you played the game for more than an hour, no. 
---
Would it not just be *Fatmen*?
---
My level 50 Combat rifle takes 15-30 bullets to kill an enemy over level 50. Even with TSE at full max it still took 3-5 Shot to kill an enemy. I have my perks set up right. 
---
Definitely, its still a bug, even if it benefits people, and it should be fixed.
---
I also had a build.
---
Will be discussing reports about this in a meeting for investigation. Thanks for your reports!
---
Your comment makes no sense. I’m saying if this ban is as big of a deal as you’re making it out to be then surely it has happened to more than a handful of people. It hasn’t, and you just want to be upset and be included in the rage boner. 
---
Dude, you better knock on wood.
---
Saw the plan you seek at Harper ferry vendor
---
There should be no way for mobs to exit the game area any more then we can, I've had that happen a number of times, once the quest marker for her was off the SW corner of the map, she decided to tour the ash heap before leaving I guess. KEK
---
My build before patch and before I quit playing because of the patch 
---
https://ibb.co/N9yxSCb
---
E=mv2 thus speed of an object is more important than mass
---
Fallout 4 is still there for you.
---
Yep, definitely right with the vendors, still 20 hrs. luckily there. The containers might have been 20 hrs. before too... but there is a pretty noticeable difference now, ugh.
---
Thank you for having some common sense and a grown up opinion.  As a fellow gamer dinosaur, I appreciate you man. 
---
Yep a gun that shoots a tiny ball of lead that does more damage than a weapon that fires a bomb which causes atoms to separate at the speed of sound/light 
---
Yeah makes total sense lol
---
Ok, Bethesda, slow your role here. You are adding a mothman PA, but the headlamp is a single headlamp??? There should be two headlamps with the mod that gives the appearance of Mothmans eyes when another player is viewing it from a distance. And I really hope your designers are making this PA more than just a reskin of an existing PA. This thing should have a cloak that looks like the mothmans wings or antennae on the helmet, both even. Make this PA look like Mothman.
---
Also, Can we please get a skin for the Excavator PA? Please? I'm sick of seeing every player walk around in the exact same PA... 
---
And keep making new PA's for us. Mothman PA has me super excited, but how about more that are like the Excavator but for different purposes(instead of weight buff). How about one that comes with a jetpack built into the check piece and it could be the Nuka-Cola PA or, a super high rad resistant one that could survive a nuke blast from the Free States. You get the idea.
---
Ok its not just me, i run full  chameleon   and keeps getting spoted all most every single time, i tho it was some type of ninja nerf or something i missed, but seems not
---
Well great, considering I've seen him twice since Beta, that should be a snap! But I'm still 5k plus whatever the update added caps short of being able to afford them... *grumble grumble*
---
Thank you. I'm what I'd consider an average player. I work 45hrs a week, have two kids in extra-curriculars, and a husband that works till 7. I'm lucky if I can play every day. I'm lucky if, even then, I can play for more than an hour. 
---
I haven't hit level 50 or killed a SBQ, but I'm thoroughly enjoying the game. It's far too expansive for me to even imagine being bored at this point. Yes, occasionally shit gets buggy for me and I get frustrated, but the overall experience has been great. 
---
Just don’t open your pip boy until your quests show up or you can open the enclave bunker doors
---
Yeah usually it corrected when i just server hopped but as its hard to know from the mutations like twisted muscels and eagle eyes i dont know if another mutation got bugged
---
Yeah, that's 210 shotgun shells.
---
I went there yesterday and it didn't have them. I'll have to check again today. 
---
All the plans like that are the same price.
---
Not for me— crashed about 6 times randomly over the past two days.
---
"(people are killing Scorchbeasts and Queens in 3-6 Sledgehammer swings vs hundreds of explosives and thousands of bullets)."
---
Wait, this is an actual complaint?  First, all I read is how the SBQ is too hard to kill post patch, and you are claiming Melee can kill it in 6 swings?
---
Also, where is the problem in that?  While the SBQ is flying, the ranged folks can put 20-30 shots into her.  When she lands, the GOD TIER melee can clean her up in a few swings.  That seems like a win/win to me.  Ranged don't waste "thousands of bullets" and the SBQ gets vanquished with minimal effort.
---
Everything else her just points to what I have said all along, Bethesda didn't ruin the game, players did.
---
&gt; or she appeared as a man.
---
SCHWING!
---
Just for  bit of balance:
---
I'm on a mid spec PC with 130+ hours and just hit level 50 (slow, I know!)
---
Since BETA I've had 8-10 server disconnects and fewer crashes (give or take 1 or 2).  I've regularly enjoyed 6 hour sessions with no issues at all!
---
I've always reasoned that PC players have such a wide variety of hardware combinations that some crashes are inevitable.  Then throw in all the other background apps that are running and how PC gamers can fiddle with .ini files and will tinker about in order to get 1 extra FPS.
---
(I also own a PS4 Pro, so if this game ever pops up on PS+ for free or dirt cheap, I'll be getting it on there too!  I guess my experience so far has been pretty good!)
---
The amount of 3* legendaries I've killed in the past 2 weeks that have dropped either nothing or some rendition of a pool cue are staggeringly high.
---
&gt; You are expecting a fully polished multiplayer experience from the get go. And I'm sorry to say but that has never and will never be a thing. Every game starts out kinda clunky then over time gets better.
---
Ah the good old 'No game is perfect' defence. 
---
I went to harpers and it wasn't there.. strange, I thought it was always supposed to be there?
---
About a dozen of us took down a SBQ in under 10 minutes on the PS4 following the patch. The battlefield was well under control too.
---
I haven't had any disconnects, but I do get the pause every time I fast travel or load in. The long load screens are there too.
---
&gt;I've never seen a non-Scorched Megasloth (Blast Zones were the only time I've seen them).
---
&gt;I've never seen a hermit crab.
---
Ya'll need to wander around the mire more.
---
Lemon sqeezie
---
Not just that but many other flavours, there's a vendor at whitesprings that sells them
---
Fair enough
---
this sub really devolved into /r/fallout levels of retardation huh
---
Hey speak for yourself now. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Not again! Stupid humble Tinkerer. 
---
Fair point haha
---
Regular guns do it too :( switch to melee again
---
I find new things about this game everyday.   
---
I've been playing on PC since the Beta and my experience has pretty much been the same.
---
Not for Bethesda tho
---
Bug 1: Sometimes an events proximity doesn't kick in. To remedy this go into the map and fast travel to the event that you are near. It will cost 0c if you are close. Too close and you can't fast travel, so run a bit. Alternatively, if it is not on your quest list on the right-hand side of your screen; there may be a bit of operator error here. If you stop tracking an event at any point; you stop tracking it forever. Go into your Pip-Boy&gt;Data&gt;Events and select the event to get the markers and rewards.
---
Bug 2: This is an alert. You get the quest because you owned it. That will always pop up so you know that it has an enemy swarm attack. You "exited" when you didn't show up to the workshop to defend it. It is an abandonment message. If you do not return to the workshop; you will get a "Failed Quest" notification. Then a new Event starts: Retake (X Workshop) - \*Enemy* has over run your workshop. 
---
I personally let my workshops go into retake. I'll take the L because the retake is easier. The swarm is nicely placed all around the workshop in easy to find places. There are no waves. You get the same reward. You aren't out looking for mole rats that decided to fight wander Scorchbeasts a mile away.
---
During the Retake Event you cannot enter build mode until all enemies have been killed. This is the same for any player that may think about stealing it. They will have to clear all your enemies before they can buy the workshop. 
---
Another pro/con of abandoning to retake is that if someone else goes to the event (as your husband did to the player that bought it while you were powering) on the map; you aren't there to stop them. The enemies will attack the player and your workshop. The pro to this is that if no one goes to your event; the creatures attacking don't do any damage as they do not spawn until a player gets into proximity. You can leave the workshop in retake almost indefinitely. No actual attacking until you show up. 
---
Jesus a phone, that’s what it takes to run the game huh lol 
---
Yeah because everything is happening all at once and from her infinite blasts to waves of enemies coming in, I’m not surprised. 
---
I actually couldn't care less about atoms. I have over 1000 just from the random pop ups that happen like "You killed 5 Scorched". There are a few things in the store that are mildly interesting, but nothing I would even spend those atoms on. I am interested in that Pip-Boy skin with the stickers but it hasn't shown up yet. The glowing map looks ok, but wouldn't really fit in my house. There might be a lamp or plants or something that would be cool, but nothing I feel like I really need for my house. Everything looks fine as it is. And I don't like change much.
---
They're working on a solution to it and planning on implementing one, so I'd expect it to be in a future patch, then removed a couple patches later.
---
Eh. I just play casually pretty much daily with my fiance snd his screen next to me. We have fun no matter what we're doing. Just a lil sad that the coolest head piece in the game is so hard to obtain. He's already got the mole head, now I just need the mr fuzzy!
---
I've literally never seen a single crossbow. I stopped playing a few weeks ago at level 76, and throughout my playtime I never saw one.
---
Go to the discord, generally more effective
---
I don't ever see scorchbeasts.  When they come around all i see are flashes of green. 
---
Glad I helped
---
There’s an explanation where the Liberators come from specifically. Have you finished all the quests yet?
---
I wish I were getting paid by Bethesda, but I'm not.
---
Do you even read?
---
Aren't TSE still top of the damage chart pretty much?  I think I people are greatly overstating this nerf.
---
I got one at Watoga. I should see if i can actually craft it. 
---
I have seen nothing to lead me to believe the community knows what's best for the game anymore than Bethesda.
---
Lovin it. Thought about doing the same for a while. Than I got my river-view ;)
---
Wait its not on rifleman? I always thought that it was just kinda bad but seriously loved the gun this needs to be fixed.
---
taking down cargo bots with melee is my favorite part of Fallout 76
---
What are the odds a melee character would use this perk!? Probably zero... right?!

Hi all, after discussing reports about this issue, we're looking for more information so that we can perform a deeper investigation. If you are willing to provide more details, please send me a private message with the following info:
---
* Your Bethesda.net account name
---
* The email address associated with your Bethesda.net account
---
* Character name where this occurred. 
---
* Any other details you think may be helpful (such as the weapon you used, amount of damage you dealt, etc.)
---
Even more expensive missiles don't fix the problem either, it just adds another way for cheaters to prosper while frustrating honest players with endless grind.
---
The fundamental issues with the missile launcher are that the damage is lackluster compared to something like  black powder musket. The lock-on feature doesn't seem to work against Scorchbeasts, even though the missile follows them and explodes on contact it does only minimal damage when they are in the air, and easily five times more if it's on the ground. The launcher also breaks too quickly.
---
Another thing that really bothers me about the missile launcher is how bad the artwork for the quad launcher is. It adds 4 barrels to the front, but only one of them vents exhaust from the missiles through the giant tube over your shoulder that makes up probably 80% of the launcher, the other 3 tubes just fire the missile exhaust into your face. How does that make any sense? It should either have a manifold that vents all exhaust out the back of the launcher, or it should do away with the giant tube and just be a rack of missiles that sits directly on your shoulder. 
---
**FOR ME**
---
It gets worse. I'm an Energy Weapons/Explosives hybrid. True hardmode.
---
Sent you a private message asking for more info. Thanks for your report!
---
Downvoting for 'toon'.

I'm sure there is a fair number of people here to see the insanity, but I have trouble making the leap it's more than a handful, but stranger things have happened

What is the damage value on a TSE gatling with our build.

I've never seen the Flatwoods Monster officially, although I have seen a purple thing in the distance

I dont know if this is any help now, but [This is a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LdNVotf_h9DnpsK2mHU-LkJPNfTy-3a8zpePSn-3WQ/edit?usp=drivesdk) I started to track what each vendor had in my endless server hop grind. I was only focusing on armor and armor mod plans, although I did add a few guns down at the bottom (mostly to show how ridiculous the radium rifle chance was at watoga).
---
All of this was pre-"known plans" patch, I havent played since then.
---
I didnt start counting the number of visits till later, so there are a few that I guessed on how many times I did it.
---
I've seen a lot of bleached dogwood 
---
Camp McClintock is specifically designed to be safer for lower level enemies and there's 20+ ballistic there. That'll be enough to fix two or three pieces and then combine it with fix it good to get some optimization out of it.
---
What's the point of this post? Gatekeeping criticism?
---
Its doable now, get rad worms and marsupial let's you jump high enough to hit them. Good luck landing though.
---
I thought about it, but I've seen other topics about this where levels 100+ don't have Heavy Armor plans listed at Watoga, or did but only one piece, too.  Plus the fact I already had one plan listed.
---
I'm hoping they didn't increase the prices and then still force us to server hop for these plans.  I believe Heavy Combat Legs were 940 Caps, give or take a few when I had 4 Charisma and Bargain 3 equipped.
---
How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?
---
I got a Two-Shot Crossbow a week before the nerf. I gave it to a low level.
---
So all I have to do is carry around an extra 20 lb weapon with ammo that is also heavy, hard to find, and resource heavy to make. Got it!
---
I think I'm finally over the game.  This happened to me several times a few days ago and when I logged in I was spawned right next to a robot that killed me.  Of course I had to log out for it to unfreeze.....great I just lost my junk.  Log back in it did it again....where a player decided to start meleeing me.  It took a while and used several stimpacks in the process (I use the perk) but he finally killed me.  Haven't logged back in since.  Don't think I will.  The desire is gone.  With anthem and division 2 coming out soon CoD will keep me occupied til then 
---
Lvl 91, can confirm it was there for me. I purchased it last night.
---
Yes, It seems to happen mostly with doors having windows, but others occasionally as well,
---
Friends will sometimes see the door as Open when I see it Closed, and I have found that if it says close when you hover over it, then you can just walk right through the door.
---
Polished is the top resistance mod for metal.  I’ve been working on a chart but like you say it’s hard to find the stats available online.  I know a heavy polished chest lands around 117DR 20ER.  I’ll share the chart if I actually finish it.
---
attn: u/Ladydevann, I concur with this. Same with HalluciGen gas canisters.
---
To your first question, yes.
---
As to your second question, I can live with the bugs, I have been playing the game since day 1, and while annoying at times, for me, they did not really interfere with gameplay. 
---
I don't want their damn atoms, I want a functioning game that is fun to play.
---
i agree i had a mod running for 76 that showed what plans i knew weeks b4 bethesda did anything about it. modders fixed ES5 and fo4's major problems very quickly.  
---
Do you get any additional benefit from chameleon armor beyond the first?
---
Guess I'm going to log on in a bit to see what all fun has been added to fight besides the ones we are supposed to deal with.. yay... 🙄🙄🙄😓😓😓
---
PSA If you take Rad x it will nullify them temporarily (probably not what your we’re doing just pointing out for others).

Bravo sir. Some actual objectivity. Bravo again

All those mini-nukes add up  :-)
---
Exactly . You need skill. They just need to touch you. That's balance, man!
---
Only items bulked that reduce weight are aluminum and lead.
---
I have always made a habit of only bulking what I am going to sell and putting it back into my stash before heading to vendors.  Once there I pull out my bulked for sell junk and sell it.  Then place back what I cannot sell into my stash, go to next vendor.
---
I can see this being an issue for Harper’s Ferry and other vendors without a stash box.  Until this is fixed I must use care not to scrap all my junk until I have sold all bulked stuff or put it back into my stash box.
---
This is an annoying bug.  I can see how if not careful it can upset someone.  In actuality you are only loosing the two plastic per bulked item.  For me plastic is too important to waste so I am always careful with what I have used it.
---
Morgantown High School gym is a great location to get more plastic.
---
You are likely very spot on, I'm just a little salty this week because the last patch rendered me unable to play (long story) and some of the issues still not fixed we've given them the fix for weeks if not months ago.
---
Hello! I've been collecting reports about this and have brought this up for discussion in meetings. Our investigation is ongoing. Thank you for report!
---
This is a known bug btw— happened to me a few weeks ago. If she is “locked onto” a player, and that player crashes or leaves the server, her pathfinding glitches and she flies out of bounds. 
---
This. I feel like enemy spawns are also tied directly to turrets. Used to have two rocket turrets, level 50 odd super mutants, scorched and radiated wolves all the time. Got rid of the turrets (and moved about 50m away from the bog, so could be that I guess), now I occasionally get some mole rats every once in a while. 
---
Salt plains variant of the Scorch Beasst ;)
---
That is one of the mods known to cause crashing on world loading, as per the comments on its mod page…
---
This is not a bug, it’s a return of one of the most beloved “features”!  It’s amazing that people are still logging in at all. After all of this the only way they are going to make a serious effort to fix it is if people quit logging. 
---
I have 2 Luck.  Still only saw Heavy Combat Legs plan once, Sturdy Combat Torso once (both first day at Watoga) and nothing else on any of the vendors.
---
Except every Heavy and Sturdy leather plan 100% of the time on every Responder Vendor.  But I'm not counting those.  I'm interested in status of the Plans for Metal, Combat, and Marine, Light/Sturdy/Heavy.  (Light Combat plans come from Abbie's Bunker main mission line, of course).
---
I appreciate the help. If you can get solid data like a screen cap or such, that'd be nice too.
---
Have you got a link to that post you referred to?
---
How the fuck was the hotfix supposed to release new content which isn't done being created yet?
---
It's been three months, even without the bugs thats not enough time to develop the content you're ranting about.
---
No nerf. Just another thing that broke with the patch. Sure they hotfixed a few hot button items like bobby pin weight etc. But there are soooo many new and now resurfaced problems that havent gotten any traction yet. I'm sure with the weekend starting right away there will be a flood of people uncovering these problems and posting.
---
I don't know if it's complete-complete, but [Nukapedia has a list of Fallout 76 armor and clothing](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fallout_76_armor_and_clothing)
---
That not atypical for software patches, especially if you re pressed for time or the people creating the patches are not deeply familiar with the software (as in what making a change will affect).
---
TLDR its still a shitshow with no end in sight.
---
Not only this but, sometimes my healing factor mutations wouldn't work, marsupial randomly stopped working in one server, Ive been taking a lot more random damage when nothing is around, some ghouls seem to be running at mach 3 speed again like in beta, I got 2 perfectly preserved pies within 30 minutes from the machines,  and it felt like my defense stats had been cut in half, everything was hitting so hard last night. I could very well just be going crazy or maybe just an unlucky set of coincidences.
---
Honestly, I think not giving out apology atoms is a good idea at least for now. People are rightly pissed at Bethesda right now, so any action they make will be immediately criticised. They’re dammed if they do, and damned if they don’t. It’s smart to wait out the rage, as much as it sucks for us.
---
Dont even compare fallout 4 to this game. Fallout 4 had much more of a story and main quest lines and paths you could take. Different companions to explore with that had quest lines of their own. 76 has very small simple quest line that doesn't take long to complete. I work full time in DC. Have family i do stuff with. And i just bought the game a couple weeks ago and even i have made it all the way through the quest line and most events. And explored most locations. And 90% of the people i encounter online are over lvl 45 most of them are over lvl 60 honestly. So its not our fault theres not much content to this game involving quest. 
---
I’m starting to think containers are more than 20 hours because i thru an area i was at the day before and every container was empty.
---
Well I've seen people as low as 5 in hazmat suits hanging out in the "barn" so not 100% sure that would work.. But good thought 
---
Similar experiences here too. Just not worth the cost/hassle.

Where? I've never seen it.

People don't even fight the queen in the nuke zone, they just tag the fissure with the edge and then fight her in the clear. This wouldn't fix that.
---
New Content = New bugs ?
---
My windmills are not in the game, but in this sub.
---
Uh yeah says the guy complaining melee is too OP. You just suck at ranged builds. Yeah reverse the rad rage build which btw means removing the rads and the radicool perk as *strength doesn't affect ranged* but it is affected by perception and luck which is where the unyielding armor comes in. Amazing how you can not only *keep distance between you and your target you can pop crits like crazy*
---
**The only thing that would prevent me from doijg my guide video is clueless people like you who would just copycat my build and then say it sucks cause you are terrible at ranged game play** 😘
---
Let me be a little more clear.  Before patch 4 I locked up but not multiple times an hour.  After patch 4 I locked up 4-6 times an hour on average,   Since the latest patch this no longer happens.  This doesn’t have anything to do with my build or my machine as they have remained the same.   The patch before this one is when it started and with the latest patch and subsequent hotfix it stopped.    The 6 guys I play with were having similar issues.   There were rarely times where we ran for more than 10 minutes without at least one of us locking up.   (And no, no one us were duping or carrying 10000 lbs). We were generally in the 225-500 lb range depending on gear we were using at the time.  Each player would describe very similar things happening before or just prior to the lockup.  Either a black or blank pipboy, being frozen in place while still seeing what went on around you, or a bzzzzzz sound followed by being bounced to the dash.    I posted about this at the time and a number of people even outside our group were having similar issues.    
---
The game is buggy and has never been super stable to begin with, but the latest patch has made it a lot better for myself and the folks I play with in terms of stability.  This was my overarching point.  
---
Yeah I get it. Sorry if I came off as defensive. I always felt like stealth was balanced for the most part so it was frustrating to see it just break with no one noticing.
---
OMG Bethesda is responsive and admits their mistakes, quelle horreur!
---
They’re not deleting threads off Reddit, and have a team engaging on social media, bâtard!
---
You moaning whiners are far too invested in what is nothing more than light entertainment costing no more than a Friday night out at the pub.
---
It’s literally _just a game_, get over yourself on how “important” it is.
---
If the game isn’t your cup of tea, stop playing and go away. Why care?
---
Seems like you got your money's worth
---
Hey! We've been discussing this one internally and investigation is ongoing. 
---
I realize this one can be frustrating, but while we work on a fix, some players have been able to avoid this issue by waiting to open the Pip-Boy until the game world is completely loaded in. Hope that helps, we'll be sure to let you know when a fix is ready to roll out for this. Thanks for your report!
---
Having the same issue with my Stealth/Sniper Character, also the chameleon effect will not disengage while I'm in PA at all, so any sort of sights other than Scopes are useless.
---
Also, even though is shows me as Hidden sometimes, enemies are still attacking me, like I'm not.
---
Phoenix the BoS vendor at Watoga Shopping Center

PC Platform - Same. Since patch day even though i'm chewing through food/water I have noticed a few things - I have not rebooted, rolled back or froze. Drops on kills seem to be more. I have not seen a difference with the perks i have nor the weapons i use.
---
Same here
---
PC :-( But I appreciate the offer! I keep clearing workshops hoping I will get them as a reward, but not dice so far. I did manage to get small letters twice on this character (my "second" character), which was nice (so I could give them to my "main"). 
---
Yeah i sell any rad x i have, never use it because of that, and it was only marsupial which was affected didnt lose any other effects. At least re logging does fix it. 
---
&gt;which is a big ask after a few beers....
---
That damn muscle memory gets me too.
---
I play on PC and am in the same boat as him.
---
lol classic case of “it’s not a problem for me so it must not exist”
---
It’s not about system specs, its a bug. I’m on PS4 and if I load into the world and I hit my pip boy button too soon the game will freeze permanently on that server until I exit and rejoin. This happens every time. You have to wait while everything fully loads before you hit your pip boy. It’s a huge problem and I see posts about it almost daily on this subreddit. But yeah I’m sure he’s making it up just to complain /s
---
Some creature I killed with melee (only way to really kill things at lvl 54) dropped a daisycutter and I got all excited to use it, went to truck stop where 3 super mutants we’re standing at the gas pumps out front. I sent a mini nuke at them, blowing up the gas pumps and after the smoke cleared 2 of the 3 were still at almost full health. And I think the gas pumps actually killed the first guy.  
---
You can jump on the bandwagon in the comments of the existing post.
---
&gt;Nothing will ever take away the fact that this is an excellent game. Don't let yourself become deluded that after you had a hundred hours of fallout bliss, that you actually didn't because of current frustrations. Don't let trolls revise your own history, because many of them hated on the game from the start, or are leaves in the wind, carried wherever the slightest breeze takes them.

It definitely didn't have them, for me, yesterday. I'll have to check everywhere again.

Gosh you've never gotten the "Megasloth mourning its cubs" encounter? It's a nice little interaction, ha
---
Hubby was playing last night and we couldn't figure out why his mutations weren't working properly.. no rad x or diluted had been used, but he had rad worms. 
---
It's become a running joke after each patch/hotfix that we can't wait to see what else has been screwed up that we have to find a way to work around.. but man this is getting old fast.. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
I just think that would be something easy to do and to be able to then put those mats into the ammo you really use would be so beneficial.
---
Great childish response there.
---
I agree 100% I play at most 3 hours a night - when I am not doing other things so - about 15 - 20 hours a week. I play a stealth commando - I do not wear power armor (Marine armor TYVM!). Since I stealth kill most of my opponents I rarely have to repair my armor - I still fix it approximately every other game session just to keep it topped off. I Love the game, I have had some minor issues in my game play, but for the most part (other then being lonely with no companions) I have had no real gripes about Fo76 and generally think it is a great and fun game... just my 2 cents.
---
Nice to see the Gatling gun getting some love here!
---
you wrote all that shit and said absolutely nothing. thanks for wasting both our time
---
Be careful they might ban you for making the game better
---
I have experienced two disconnects since the patch I think.   I’ll take that over the lockups and bounces to the dash.  That said, it’s sad the bar is so low that I’m happy only having been disconnected a couple of times.  It’s progress however, I’ll take it.  
---
At least you're contributing in a meaningful way...
---
Yea it is a disaster, it’s even more frustrating when players are trying to give them info on bugs and even potential fixes, I totally understand your saltiness. 
---
The potential is here for this game, I don’t want to give up on it but these updates seem to be too little and not often enough, it would probably be business suicide but maybe they should take the servers offline for a month and go hard on fixing it.
---
I recall FF14’s launch state and gameplay was trash, but they worked hard and rereleased it and now it’s one of the highest MMOs, perhaps Bethesda should consider it. 
---
I'm as annoyed by Scorchbeast spam as anyone else, but has it been acknowledged as a bug? They are basically end game bosses and even with just Excavator power armor I can take quite a few hits. If bethesda makes them even easier to kill, they will have to either increase their damage output or their armor. None of these options are particularly appealing.
---
Then don't play ranged build. The idea of being a *marksman* is exactly that, Being able to nail perfect shots VATS system or not. 
---
Can’t WAIT for Division 2, I won’t preorder it but I’m very optimistic and will buy it once the reviews are good.
---
Hi! I've been collecting reports on this. Will bring it up for discussion and investigation. Thank you!
---
pretty much, if it's not done in the stockholm syndrome way this people approve us apparently you're just a troll or not a 'true fan' or a 'try hard' 
---
Timer is pretty ugly and the map already isn't realtime rather a snapshot of when you opened it
---
Frequent disconnects will do that.  I have seen that as a common complaint for console users in some other games, and I have to wonder where the actual problem lays, but I don;t have a console so I can;t really research that.  If I did, I would fire up a copy on PC and an copy on a console and monitor the network traffic on both then compare the logs to see if I could find the cause, be it the game client, the Bethesda servers or the console network or even my home network.  Maybe someone here has done that and can post their findings?
---
Really should have a timer reset once people start the event
---
Heres what you can do.  Travel to the Valley Galleria, go inside and spend 20 minutes wandering around looting and killing scorched.  Then go back to to the Whitespring hotel.  I promise, it will not sound as bad anymore.
---
imagine thinking that's what insecurity is
---
Ditto
---
Thank you for voicing this. I am one of these casual gamers only cause real life, like employment and keeping my family warm and fed, are in the way.  Sure I'm disappointed that they nerfed some legendaries just as I'm cresting level 45 and about to be able to use my legendary TSE shotgun I've been carting around for the last 4 weeks and 20+ levels, just because I could.   
---
I'm not about the uninstall the game cause some ree-rees out there are reeing.... I'm still enjoying playing the way I want to.   
---
People who want hard endgame content right now aren't going to listen to any reason why their idea is bad.
---
And if we were Space Marines, explosive rounds would have been buffed and plasma guns would be OP as hell but have a chance of going nuclear on the spot.
---
For five bucks I could get a stack of old Christmas movies from a yardsale near me. I should probably give up video games entirely with that kind of dollar per hour return. 
---
Honestly, the biggest problem with explosive weapons is the scaling from levels that is in the game.  This goes doubly for grenades since they work fine at low level but once you get into the higher levels they just don't do nearly as much damage as they should considering their accuracy.  Then you have missiles and mini-nukes which, while they scale well in damage (well mininukes do, missiles just suck) they suffer from insanely heavy ammo costs they break insanely easily.  
---
How to fix?
---
Add levels to grenades such that you level cap uber grenades just like weapons so low level folks can't use level 50 frags.  Scale the damage based on level.
---
Missile launchers/Fatman: rework how durability works for these weapons or greatly increase base durability.  Level scaling is already in place.
---
Jesus Christ I bet you talk like that too
---
True.  
---
This is making me feel more and more like a dumb ass for buying the Power Armor edition. Easily the worst purchase of my life.
---
Yeah, I'm surprised about the latter, at least.  I think there's always at least one Hermit Crab along the main highway in the Mire.
---
learn to write Todd like, you absolute hack
---
You're right, foresight isn't a strong suit of Bethesda.
---
At we'll have something to do even if it's complain about the bugs
---
Furious, two shot isnt really worth having. But furious is still good against big stuff.
---
Sorry to hear.  It truly seams to be a mixed bag.   After every patch some people have better stability and some worse.  
---
People don't seem to understand some weapons needed TSE to be decent.  Those weapons are really bad now.  Same goes for explosive non legendary weps.
---
Exactly something needs to be done with the damage of these things, I was at Welch the other night and fired 20 missiles into a scorch beast which all they did was tickle it...its ridiculous 
---
I totally agree with this!
---
Ok so what is this op T3 shotgun you are using? What are its perks? What's your perception? What perks are you using? I have seen VATS miss flat out on a 99% hit chance from 4 foot away. Jist because you dont think it missed doesn't mean it hit.
---
Get over it or quit the game, either way we dont care.
---
My character is 
---
Thanks for your input, skippy
---
From what I have read, you can take a few extra steps before you de-cloak. That seemed to be the case but could have been server lag as well so there's no telling.
---
Should ask yourself why you feel obligated to force feed your own opinion onto someone. Because that’s exactly what you’re doing.
---
Oh, I dared to state my displeasure with a game that up u til now I had been supporting. And here you are, an offended fanboy who just has to try to insult and belittle me in his own attempts to feel validated, crying and whining because someone dared stare a differing opinion all the while making accusation to project his own actions onto others.
---
The fact that you seem to need to reply more than once to me simply because my opinion is different from yours speaks volumes. You don’t have to read my posts, not at all. But you’ll read this one and you’ll reply. All because I dared make my opinion public and it somehow makes you feel a need to defend a game.
---
Don’t like my opinion? Move on. 
---
The game had potential. The game is obvious shit, and only deteriorating. It’s being changed from somewhat challenging to “here, let all the whiney little douches have everything easy!” 
---
I do appreciate your response and seeing CMs in here in general. There are still some of us who really want this game to work. We’re holding on. But everyone has a breaking point.  This week has really hurt you guys for a myriad of reasons. You folks need a win, sooner rather than later or this could get really ugly.  
---
Almost 300 hours in. I've never seen an ultracite weapon, radium rifle, laser musket, junk jet, alien blaster, Tesla rifle, thirst zapper, rolling pin or candy cane.
---
Agree
---
Just a heads up, this corporate speak and artificially sweet attitude is really off putting when dealing with people who are frustrated that they have to deal with day 1 bugs, bugs that are “fixed” and then reintroduced, or the “fix” is almost as bad as the bug itself. I know that you’re doing the best you can, and we appreciate that, but “brought up for discussion in meetings” sounds really low urgency considering the fact that your end game content in a game with very little content to start is effectively broken. 
---
Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad.
---
They’re not doing a great job. The last patch rolled back previous changes. Version control is so incredibly basic that if you think they’re doing a good job despite this failing, I have a bridge to  you. 
---
I said it before and I'll say it again, the fanboys don't want anyone spoiling their circle jerk.  
---
I was wondering if anyone was going to bring this up.
---
Also, you're assuming the low-level player even knows to build a nuke shelter, and has the resources to build it (after all the other basics like workbenches, storage, etc).
---
You'd definitely need to figure out something for newbies to even consider something like this.
---
FF14 they took offline for 2 months to fix it...   
---
And worked with the community..  
---
So that could literally be the answer.  
---
All that aside I agree(d) with you for the last 3 months, and was a very vocal defender. Might just need to take the weekend off and see what I think on Monday.  
---
  If your really bored check out the "big" post that finally got one of the community managers to respond to this one..

Melee was always outperforming guns to begin with that's why it was the meta before TSE was widely distributed. 
---
Now that TSE is gone, melee shines again. It's funny melee players where the ones who demanded TSE be nerfed into the ground because it one shot things and were "all duped" but it's like they don't even look into the mirror.
---
Love it. Nice work!
---
Great idea! They’re gonna get right on it
---
Well, as I agree for vodka, bourbon, whiskey etc. bottles, I can't agree for nuka-cola - they looks more sturdy and diffiicult to break. And what's crucial, that game has far more important problems than multiple bottle used for molotovs, really...

Some of us aren't children with unlimited game time to wait around for Bethesda to unban our asses because they couldn't be bothered to do enough QA to prevent item duping or even track who has what items. 
---
May try this one day. Right now I’m just too jaded with the path the game seems to be taking.
---
This game needed to come out april 2019 
---
Yeah, I've collected several and have looked at the damage with all three maxed Rifleman perks vs. all removed, no change. Researched it for Heavy perks and other posters had the same results.
---
This is why modus gives you those orbital strikes. This is the exact reason. Their intended purpose in the game
---
I wouldn't call it childish--I'd call it provocative or generally unhelpful.
---
I found one early early in the game and scrapped it. Wish I still had it since I've gone full stealth ninja.
---
Another person playing the game like how I'm playing the game - i.e. rapid stabbing with dinky knives rather than a Super Sledge.
---
"English is everyone's first language"
---
That doesn't change my stance.

Same here , but once I stumble into a player killing one.

&gt;classic case of “it’s not a problem for me so it must not exist”
---
My house has never been burgled so I know this so called 'crime' doesn't exist.
---
Exactly this. If I was getting plans with my 75 that my 49 doesn't have, I would understand. However, my 49 shouldn't be getting stuff that my 75 isn't.
---
Vendor plans seem to still to be at least partially randomized or there's still an issue with things disappearing as I level up. Neither of which should be there case according to the patch notes.
---
Keywords there is *with my axe* which means it's a two handed weapon. Yeah no shit two handed weapons do nice damage but even with martial artist are still slow AF and can easily be maneuvered around. You know what happens when a two handed melee opponent runs out of AP? You put miles between you and shoot the hell out of them. And being a melee user I can tell yoy hands down 3 swings of a axe and your ap bar is empty.
---
Yeah, honestly, this has it's merits. I'd be fine with a no-zone warning, triple radius and the gentle suggestion to get indoors ASAP.
---
You have to wait; sometimes a very very long time.
---
When you first kill it, it will preset the default normal loot table.
---
Then it asks the server "hey this was a legendary I need some legendary loot" then the server will send down the extra stuff.
---
If you're paying close attention you can actually see this happen as the inventory on the corpse changes.
---
BUT sometimes that extra server call for the legendary loot takes a LOOOOOOOONG time.
---
Personally I’d choose the Furious one cause I prefer more stable weapons. The higher recoil and lower accuracy of the TS doesn’t do it for me, and the Gatling shoots fast enough with the right setup to ramp up fast enough.

You shouldn't be able to kill the endgame boss of a game in 3 to 6 swings of a basic melee weapon. Period. If you *are* able to do that, something is wrong with the balance. Either the boss is too squishy or the melee weapon is overpowered.
---
Pre nerf a maxed out white knight needed one ballistic fiber to repair my armor. Post patch it takes two. This is not an increase that requires increasing the spawn rate of anything. Ballistic fiber is still so common I literally have over 200 taking up space in my stash. 
---
They were never great. Not once. 
---
I'm in a weird middle state. I've been playing since B.E.T.A.  I'm level 51 or 52 (See? i don't even know). My C.A.M.P. is a shack. My "build" is a mess of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and perks i picked because they were useful at the time. My best weapon is something i built myself and does like 118 damage before any bonuses i might have. I am definitely no hardcore beast. I realize the game is buggy, but mostly it hasn't been a big issue. Yes, it crashes and disconnects more that most games, but really it's maybe been a dozen times each since the beginning. Not game-ruining. It's fun. That's all i care about.  
---
That said, after the patch, i did feel like taking a break. The rollbacks were annoying, but they'll be fixed. Mostly i just got to a spot where i'm not strong enough to finish the BoS quests, or to launch a nuke (by myself; i'm more comfortable soloing). But i'm far enough along that i don't have much else to do, and i'm not really getting more powerful, so i'm kind of aimless atm. But i've got a huge game backlog that needs attention. I've got some tv to catch up on. NBD. I'll come back - next month, next week, maybe tonight. I'm cool with it. I've already played 10x what i have many other games. Definitely got my money's worth even if i never play again.
---
&gt; There are bugs and problems but they told us that would be the case.
---
They said there would be bugs, openly in prelaunch interviews? What in an effort to stave off the avalanche of madness that would ensue?
---
Some Goddamn inside walls or each building set. I have the barn building set and I had a store before I switched to just a normal house. And it was so big I wanted inside walls to separate areas like the entrance, and my garage. But I had to use the ugly wood walls, and it just killed the look. 
---
I somehow got the Tesla Rifle plan early on. Got a legendary rolling pin the other day (useless lol).
---
I've got some ultracite ammo but I've never seen a gun or receiver for it.
---
Didn't even know the rest were in the game. Good comment :)
---
I don't remember when's the last time I had to go out scavenging for anything. I just loot junk on the way to whatever else I'm doing. I ran out of springs a couple weeks back, but managed to get enough back to repair my 10 weapons that kept breaking instantly. Maxing out weapon artisian for repairs seems to have somewhat fixed the issue.
---
I think its just as clearly certain melee is broke as fuck.  But yea that too
---
Whilst I do care for a level playing field, my main aim in this is to bring some love to these weapons that would normally get left or sold rather than used
---
Uninstalled. Also, found a few tweets that summarized my feelings nicely.

---
I’m having same issue with brick walls someone told me might be level based tho.
---
If you read the OP, it was not to take the game so seriously.
---
If stalkers are gonna threadjack to push their agenda, folks should be able to counter, tit for tat.
---
I think what they completely missed on was the almost gambling like rush of killing ghouls to see if you hit the jackpot. Sure, you ended up with mostly junk, but once in awhile you hit gold. I can actually remember getting my very first explosive effects weapon. Now, my armor breaks, the ghouls drop drills and flare guns, and finding that cool weapon isn’t fun because it’s been nerfed into oblivion.  They don’t get we want an escape not another job where I have to grind to find junk. That’s just not fun. 
---
Yeah I’ve noticed in a post of my own that this seems to be the go to reaction from fanboys.
---
Dude, it's 2019. People stopped using "gay" as a pejorative over a decade ago. Grow the fuck up.
---
I don't remember, it was days ago and I didn't comment in the thread, sorry

I seem to have this way too often. Without going into a long speech, 3 star legendary mobs should always drop 3 star legendary loot. 
---
Jokes on them, I love being a radioactive hillbilly that runs around looking for my next banjo to play.
---
I play hundreds of hours of online gaming on my ps4. It's not them. I can play Destiny all week without a single disconnect. Dumpster fire servers like FO76 and RDR2 (which is actually *waaay* worse than fo76), in the other hand, its quite frequent and consistent. Definitely not on my end or PSN's.
---
Fo3 fatman = some crazy shit
---
Fo76 fatman = worst than a baseball bat 
---
After the disaster that is Fo76, I don't know if I trust Bethesda enough to commit to a good game again or if they will keep doing these shitty business tactics
---
Have you tried the Path to Enlightenment mission near the light house in the east?
---
Or do you mean a random run in with Mothman?
---
I agree except for the balancing for the casual players and not the "tryhards" 
---
So first my opinion my be a bit flawed because I'm looking at this through a competitive shooter perspective but it still should have some wait 
---
So in a lot of games the devs balance a lot of things based of of pro or high level play as opposed to the "casual" players for the simple fact that a lot of the casual players barely even know how the game works or even how to determine what is even op
---
Whyyyyu
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Honestly, the two prefixes (ts and e) should never have been attainable on the same weapon. Each on their own is a nice boost but together the multipliers stack very high. Simply release a patch that seperates the two guns giving players a choice on wether they want ts or e.
---
If the developers had just patched and seperated them it wouldn't be a problem hell I wouldn't even minded the demo expert perk not counting for legendary exploding prefix. But a 60 pct boost (demo) to a 20 pct overall boost is ridiculous. I can take off 5 ranks of demo right now and I only lose 17 damage points. 
---
Probably would be too much to handle for the server if everyone was using them. Since we can't even drop items without them being in a placeholder container, it might not be possible. 
---
Really nicely done. 
---
Gotta get rid of all turrets too.
---
Yeah, all these people with loads of time, you're not the **majority**. You know how many people have even made it to the end game? 10%. If you're complaining about end game bugs and imbalance, you're an **elitist** and Bethesda should ignore you.
---
Most people don't even bother playing through to level 25, and those are the people Bethesda cares about most (them and the &lt;10% of people who have bothered to engage in meaningful levels of PVP).
---
Hmmm maybe it has to do with what level u are..but glad u found it!!
---
This has been my consistent experience. It seems I almost always get there just as it's ending/ended.
---
Hey Devan i sent you a personal message regarding something. I do hope it went through if not could you let me know so i can try again.
---
Pleasant Valley seems to have everything listed.

I use glow sight in the nuke zone.i only had Demolitionist on because of the SBQ was using a Anti Armor Explosive Prime Handmade for the Queen.

---
Built that patch. A big beautiful powerful patch.
---
Im not trying to beat the game. Im just trying to play a fire crazed ferschnatdedhsgf masked officer that runs around in PA and fires fucking lazer beans at a million shots a second. 
---
I would appreciate it if it didnt take 3 hours (exageration) of prep for 15 minutes of fun to do that. I would like it if my play style was supported, rather than making me get stuck in power armor, not letting me repair it at a camp, charging a shit loads of springs, making storage so hard that im redtricted to one power armor, making ammunition a chore, making my gun break constantly, etc. Etc.
---
ONE OF US, ONE OF US, GABBA GABBA HEY
---
Holy crap that looks amazing!
---
They need to just keep it and let us equip unarmed weapons in power armor. There’s no good reason they can’t, especially if a bug can let it happen, it’s not a technical issue and I don’t see any balance issues. 
---
I'm the idiot? If you can't see the comparison with your comment, then maybe you should take a long look at yourself. "Boohoo I don't like this, I think exploits should not be banned and I'm afraid to press any button because I'm too dumb to think for myself and anyone who disagrees with me is an idiot because they are gonna get banned because everyone is getting banned for playing the game, and fuck anyone who likes this game anyway because they are idiots who do not share the same views as me" yeah, maybe you should look up what critical thinking is before spewing shit. 
---
Built that patch. A big beautiful powerful patch. 
---
I could definitely trade in ballistic fibre for springs, or screws, or flux.  
---
But I'd rather be using that time on new questlines, some dungeons to clear, a boss fight that doesnt require Power Armour.   
---
I can't make any choices that will provide these things.
---
Yes I've been north. I think the issue is I didn't check the trees because I'm normally too busy looking for radscorpions lol
---
Hey! We're currently planning to make Bleached Dogwood an item that needs to be manually scrapped. This didn't make it into the last patch, but is on the way. Thanks!
---
I'm assuming they mean teleport. I've fast travel. 
---
Could be wrong tho!
---
i don't know, it was a bug a while ago, it was one of those "you had to be there for it to be funny" sort of things
---
People can vote as they please, I don't consider karma when I post a comment, if I did I would only post negative comments about the game on this subreddit since that kind of post seems to get the most karma love currently.
---
Every multiplayer game I have ever played has had an equipment grind built in, though some are worse than others.  Chasing good equipment or mats to craft it of the currency to buy it is part of a huge number of games.  If that is all you are focused on then it gets boring at some point and you lose interest and one way around that is to not over-focus on that process.  You do not have to have 'the best armor' you only need 'good enough armor'.   Same with weapons.  If you over focus on being efficient then you lose focus on other parts of the game, often parts that make the game fun, and stress yourself out when the object of the game is to have fun.  That is my perspective anyways. 
---
It hasn't been acknowledged as a bug directly, but if you use a mod that alters the sound effect of scorchbeasts (I'm talking the [noot nood mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/174)), you can actually pick out that some scorchbeasts are screeching way more than they probably should be. When they caught in this loop, it just doesn't stop, which is either poor game design, or a bug.
---
Level 52 and I just discovered the Crashed Space Station yesterday! The map is one of the best Bethesda have ever created
---
Is vats any good for the gat?
---
And again we need to discuss that artists are not developers and that different fucking people do different fucking things in the same fucking company.  
---
They need to give us plans to build "Pulowski Preservation Shelters" in our bases. You can survive anything in those, explosion wise.
---
But to answer your question .. no.
---
Even if that stat window actually had the total damage resistances of the applied pieces rather than the zero it has atm for the chassis I could figure out which is which, or if you clicked inspect and then had visuals, anything would be better than having to put them all out and collect them all back up
---
Calling Fallout 76 an MMO is like calling fortnite an RPG
---
I travel along the highway in the mire sometimes, and yeah, I usually run into about three or four when I do. 
---
You’re so right. Everyone with *valid* criticisms haven’t played the game they’re just pretending. 
---
Is there a way to complete the roof without having stairs?
---
&gt; If you are familiar with the game but no longer play, why troll and linger in a sub that you don’t play?
---
maybe he wants to play it and is waiting for them to hopefully resolve this in as quick a timespan as possible (not like bethesda to actualy resolve this quickly, remember skyrim on the ps3?)
---
The thing is Bethesda only knows how to buff enemies and nerf player weapons.....so nerf the melee....we all bitch then as one big family until hopefully someone at Bethesda starts thinking straight and fixes this shit up!
---
Bloodied or anti armor do more than 2 shot; +50% limb damage, +50% vats crit do more than 20% explosive.
---
TSE is weak compared to many other combos now.
---
i understand that, but a majority of everything here is jsut slandering on a game, i enjoy it, and disliek its bugs as well, but they should be adressed calmly, not whats going on here, this place has gone south and it's nto enjoyable to hang out here anymore
---
They will do it again too.  
---
Will just wait for another studio to do it right, and I’ll totally be on board. 
---
Final fantasy mmorpg has been going strong. 
---
[We've been here before](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abwqnu/bethesda_doesnt_understand_hotfixes_and_schedules/) and your definition of a hot fix is a misunderstanding at best. I have been in the software game for over a decade and a "hotfix" means it's urgent and being deployed to a live production system outside the usual development pipeline. It's often for security vulnerabilities or bugs/issues that are significantly customer impacting and need to be fixed immediately. Just the nature of some software means you may need to need to take a server offline to put the hotfix in place.
---
This guy spent a lot of time to be a fucking dick.
---
1. Lag everyone else out.
---
2. No one benefits from turret kills. The dick in the turret box doesnt get drops unless he personally shoots the ferals, and the players trying to farm also miss out if they dont score any direct hits.
---
3. This just obnoxious and point less. If you wanna have a fortress go do it in FO4, this is a shared game space and he's just shitting on everyone else's game time and server latency with this assery. 
---
Nice, seeing an improvement? I'm curious as to if it benefits sever CPU s like mine more or equal to others.
---
So basically, you and most people are not at end game content, so the people who are at end game content should STFU about what's broken about end game.
---
The fickle beasts don't like truth-bombs. Fixed your downvote.
---
Well that ball isnt "tiny" but the point is very valid
---
I agree with you been having a great time playing and just random crashes every once in awhile. I did get hit hard with the paper bag not showing up early on and lost most of my good weapons and armor. But just embraced the grind and have good stuff again.  Very fun and enjoyable game!
---
I hope Todd sees this post and flips the “Mods and Private Servers” switch to on. I heard he was waiting for you to post something about it.
---
Just look for the whiter than average ones :P. Also yeah, fuck radscorpions I keep an eye out for them too, lol.
---
It keeps it pointed at the target until your AP runs out, so every shot lands if the target is close (which is great for the furious one).
---
They're incompetent dumbass brigade, what did you expect?
---
They'll nerf your favorite stuff on the game though.
---
Yeah, go ahead and PM me. I don’t have as much time to play as I did early on, but I’m always happy to team up with new people. 
---
Thanks for bringing this up! Investigation into reports about this is ongoing. 
---

---
Polowski shelters don't save you from a nuke, tried and died in one at whitespring station
---
Sigh...
---
There are three things at work here.  First is The gender perception gap - where you take 30 or so people in a room and have 27 be male and 3 be female and it seems normal (especially to men) but if you shift figures so there are 22 men and 8 women suddenly the men feel outnumbered. Yes, this really is a thing.
---
Next is personal bias. Everyone assigns importance to characters and storylines differently.  One of my favorite characters is Delbert Winters. His coming to terms with his beliefs and feeling left behind was very well done. He also has the recipe book with his own named recipes so even when I am out in the wilds he has a presence in my game.  Another player may fly by quickly, never read the terminal and forget about poor Delbert five minutes later, choosing to focus on say, Kesha and Maria instead.  Your personal bias will also affect which jobs you see as most important. If a woman in the game had a job you think is important that will influence how you see the distribution of roles.
---
Finally how you play through the various storylines and quests will slant not only how you see the characters, but which ones you see. If you follow a lot of the female-centered storylines and miss the some of the male-centered ones your play through will feel like there are a lot of women.
---
I would say Fallout 76 is a good step in the direction of fairly even male and female roles, unlike Fallout 4 where you have 3 female companions and 8 male ones. Skyrim was very well set up with the roles evenly divided between men and women but the Fallout games have always lagged behind.
---
I'd also add, there is nothing "PC" about wanting to see yourself reflected in your character or the npcs you interact with. 
---
I guess I needed a /j
---
Aww did GLs not get added in with explosives like the patch said it was supposed to? *sigh*
---
Wrong. Most TSE weapons do 1/4 of their former damage. 
---
Enjoy using it while it’s viable, a sudden nerf may hit it unexpectedly 
---
Its better, no question.  But all my unarmed tuning became useless in the end game.  Why was that even an option?
---
I do that a lot as well. Still bad...
---
Forget lame atoms, which you can acquire for free by just playing the game. A free "Apology" Respect would make a tremendous positive impact on Bethesda. Or at least an option to respec. 
---
Rad worms has broken everything that cast a “spell” and doubles it. Perks, chems, etc. 
---
I would recommend using a bloodied or furious explosive Gatling gun for max sustained DPS, burst will still be high as well because fire rate is positively insane.
---
It's ain't that unstable. That's a really good price. Go for it.
---
My character is about as stealthy as Leeeeeroy Jenkins right now.
---
This is more an is it possible like fo4 when you could become invincible with a certain set of gear and perks.
---
We must be on separate platforms. 
---
Thank you :) i been looking for this item forever.
---
Found some BOS underarmors there aswell so iam glad :)
---
After they fixed those camp bugs, all of the problems I had with the game went away.  On PC, I don't use "mods" and almost never see bugs or crashes.
---
A more animal crossing direction would be nice 
---
Or maybe its true and devs can only fix so much so fast. They are just people after all. I'm pretty sure this is high on the list considering most of the bugs seem to be dealt with. I'm having trouble thinking of any non visual bugs atm.
---
So far i got SBQ derping off, workstations not loading at the spot and ...oh falling through the world floor in spawn to reset position. Pretty sure a content patch is coming in the next 30 daya because of this.
---
On a related note, go to Haven Church at night.  It's haunted and there's an organist.
---
Vendor exploit coming in 3...2...1...
---
omg yeah nuke world was super fun even if useless and silly
---
Lmao get off the meth....you got lots of dudes in your head telling you shit hahaha ..... so what am I eating for breakfast.
---
With the current state of the game casual play is actually the best way to play. The problems people are having is because they need the game to be a min/max semi competitive game. If you just want to have fun you will. 
---
We are stuck until they release FEV into the air 
---
Tonight I am going to participate in this Data-gathering attempt:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am2f1t/vendor_plan_list_experiment/
---
Going to go around each vendor I have access to and record which plans are for sale.  I might server hop at Watoga a couple times just to see what if anything changes.
---
I'm a casual player - started playing Jan 1 - Some nights i put in 4 hrs but very fragmented. Mostly my time is spent exploring because fast travel isn't feasible when you are around 1k caps always. I fast travel sometimes but mostly the path i am on is usually discovery of areas. I use a small subset of weapons and have never done a nuke run. In every game I've played online, there is always the elitist group who rush through the game to reach top level/gear. There is the middle group who make up for the majority of the game and then there is the bottom percentage of people who bought the game but don't care enough to play it regularly. The issue is the elitist will always find the bugs/exploits first cause they are the ones getting to end game and have nothing to do but to kill whatever the top level thing that will give them the most challenge. The middle group is there exploring, leveling, meeting people etc.... These two groups rarely get along because the elitist are " this weapon only does 30 fps at a range of 100m/sec and only vs humans but not animals" The middle group is "OMG this shotty peels the wood from the trees"..... Just because someone is enjoying a game doesn't mean they are not dealing with the same issues as the ones who mathematically know what weapons does what damage on what type of NPC. End of the day we all want stability in this game!! So what if my bobby pins reverted back to a weight that they previous set in a game or that you're going through water/food faster. I don't know what a TSE is but if you're able to two or one shot anything in this game, the drop rate should be .0000001% and you shouldn't be able to mass duplicate it to sell it for real money. Nor should everyone be waling around with legendary armor. Some of this is why i walked away from Destiny - Everyone had the same crap and if you didn't it was because you were leveling but you knew once you hit max level you could just do one or two runs to get it. I played Wow when top level was 50 - It was hardcore to pvp and be top tier. Then they started to change it so pvp meant nothing. It din't matter if you pvp'd all the time or just some because you could still obtain the same gear. It became that gear was just easier to get so everyone had it, there was no benefit over other players.  I just know i spent $25 on a game that has issues and not $60 because i realized in BETA it wasn't ready yet so I waited. I've had issues but the most frustrating issues I have dealt with were cause from dup'g in the game by players who seem to only want to progress through exploits. It's sad we focus all of our energy fighting with each other over the weight of bobby pins but not the dup'g. I have seen more bobby pin posts than dupping in the past.
---
if you have played the game to the point that you have burned through the existing content then it is time to find a new game until new content comes out or find something else in the game to keep you occupied.  Game companies plan content distributions based on how long the 'average' player takes to get through what they offer at launch. Folks that play a lot more than Joe/Jane Average have to deal with that.  A good game will have multiple things built in to cover that lapse in content, like pvp, building, etc.  I wish this game fishing for that reason, I suck at pvp.
---
I seriously can’t even wrap my head around the idea of taking even a few minutes of my day to go to the subreddit of a game I hate, read posts about it and flame people who like it. 
---
It would never even occur to me to do that.  
---
It’s kinda sad, really. I sincerely hope you’re no older than 14. If you’re older than that, dude, get a life. 
---
It is what it is... 
---
Hmmm it means you can kill enemies that only take a few shots faster with the two shot...but Gatling are moderate damage per shot so the enemies that die like that are either low level or lower HP types. 
---
Wait you use VATS? Is that preference or build reasons(Luck build/perks) cause if you had any on-hit effects you like, that makes Two Shot a clear winner.
---
But what you’re not getting is the nuke doesn’t have a stat like 1000 DMG you have to try to resist, its insta-death man, good luck trying to survive it though! I’ll hang out on the edge and collect your junk for you
---
Console peasant got it...

**I will say this once and once only**

*All the people complaining about melee being too OP, Let me tell you something, The only advantage melee has over ranged right now is slap damage and I say this because in order for you to be able to deal full damage to a person they have to hit you back to remove slap damage in which case a melee has to get into melee range to hit you immediately giving them the advantage of being in range of you*

Okay got it Turret Camps turning my game into a Power Point Presetation good.

When you’re older you’ll realize that it’s ok for people to like things that you don’t.

Wouldn’t have been if OP was objective about his post. Otherwise how could anyone help? Nope just another petulant child on reddit.

No trouble killing here here with 15 minutes left. Double shot/vampire gatling gun with all 3 heavy perks and my trustly lever action and axe. I wasn't affected by the patch since i never had a Oneshot weapon.
---
:(
---
Seems fruitful 
---
Strength has perk cards to negate 45% of melee damage. I admit they're strong, but come with big disadvantages.
---
Dude you just describe exactly what I do. Two or three hours of fallout and as soon as frustration sits in I switch to battlefield and kick some ass lol 
---
People need to stop acting like this game represents evil and the end of the world.
---
Just be aware of your budget as you build,
---
Turrets are pricey but if you’re in high travel areas, (muties and ghouls and griefers oh my..)
---
Turrets are nice.
---
Or move someplace less popular and go big without turrets
---
Can you give a damage number for those?
---
Easy guy, I wouldnt want you to *assume* anything about me and break all the rules of this sub Reddit in one sentence or less. So lets keep to the game chat or do yourself a favor and don't speak at all.
---
Thank you for this post. I stopped playing fallout 76 cause I needed a break (plus life has to happen). And now I want to get back into the game. But not with these try hards. They ruin the game. I'm only lvl 52 and feel like I'm just beginning. I like taking my time and understanding the game and what's going on. Unlike some of these couch potatoes who pee in cups that like to ruin things for everyone else.
---
I have yet to find an Assaultron Circuit Board and I really want one for a helmet. So if anyone knows where to get one, let me know because I've killed so many Assaultrons trying to get one, it's a massive waste of ammo. And up until this week I'd never seen a chicken (I've been playing since day one).
---
I've been saying it with a hard g for nearly 25 years bub.
---
Has this been datamined because looking at bethesda's past coding I wouldn't be surprised if it was just an extremely high number
---
That is an option, but there are folks who have found alternatives that satisfy them. I see a number of high level folks playing without PA, and several at the Scorched Earth events even inside the nuke zone.  Not sure they do it, but they are there.  Maybe that bloodied build I keep hearing about?
---
I dont know why you're getting downvoted, since you also have the same issue I do, and your 3* drops are awful, just like a lot of people I imagine, given I've seen complaints around the subreddit.
---
It only mentioned the M79 so they already failed by forgetting the auto grenade launcher is fubar’d. But yeah, it didn’t change anything from what I could see. Prepatch Demo Expert worked for it and post patch it still did, but the damn thing still weighs almost 8 lbs and I have both Bear Arms and Ordinance Express. And it definitely doesn’t get Grenadier’s benefit. 
---
It's worse than that. At least gatekeeping implies that, once you meet an arbitrary standard, then your opinions become valid. This guy is straight up invalidating every ounce of criticism this subreddit levies towards FO76 because we "aren't the game's core, casual playerbase" so our opinions must not matter.
---
Not only that, this is literally the second time he's done this. This dude's legit so conceited that he not only believes he can dismiss tens of thousands of peoples' feelings on the basis of "well you aren't the game's true playerbase ;)", he believes his opinion is so important that it should be heard twice. Who knows if this guy is gonna write another novel every single time Bethesda releases a shitheap patch that makes everyone mad so he can take a part time job reminding everyone that everyone is wrong except for him.
---
How does this shit have upvotes? Just when you think this sub starts to develop some room for nuanced discussion and legitimate constructive criticism, a few thousand people decide to give a guy like this a platform. How embarrassing.
---
I feel your pain tho I have never played 76 or plan to but I get banned for third party software when I use a program to take out erratic mouse movements ( there is a mouse to do so but it's more then I can afford ). I suffered a TBI I got while on tour in afganistsn. and randomly.through the day I get episodes of sparatic  nervous contractions that cause my.hand to shake my program is keybound and not always on so far dirty bomb and paladins have banned me.for it and refuse to look further into the case. Sucks those games where fun now adays I'll email support before even buying a game.letting them know about condition and my "hack". Some have okay with it others tell me don't bother even playing there game. 
---
Which vendor has it?
---
Ok thanks. 
---
An opinion shared by very few.
---
I play on console and I *was* in the same boat until the recent patch deleted my photos, otherwise I’m happy with my experience so far!
---
good bye letter inc? I know sweet child, I've never experienced gaming companies release updates,patches and hotfixes before either. 
---
You've got seven silver, seven gold, and 2,664 likes on this post. If your argument is that this sub is not representative of the vast majority of 76 players, I would reflect on the success of this post, and that it might not be valid as a representative opinion of the vast majority of players, due to its success here, according to your assessment.
---
As for the game, I suggest everyone that enjoys it should continue playing. I think I have 100 hours of enjoyable gameplay. I'm stopping now with plans to return in a year or so. If I never do, I still find my experience to be worth the cost of the game. 
---
Would I recommend it to others? No. Not unless I bought it for them. I couldn't in good faith tell someone this game is universally worth its price, although it has been for me.
---
The problem with this patch is that in lieu of addressing the problems of players getting to the end game too quickly by working on new content, they decided to make the game more artificially grindy by increasing weapon and armor degradation and increasing prices.
---
I don't want to spend my time looking for springs. And I can't wrap my head around the idea a gun will only last for 10 minutes of combat, at which point a constant stream of random garbage is the only fix. I find scorchebeasts to be more believable.
---
Dude, just move on? Focus on the things you like - much better way to spend your time.
---
Can you collect the reports on the V.A.T.S bug aswell? Shots not filling the meter 95% chance shots going off to the side in 3rd person.
---
Please? No one has said anything about this
---
Well if you need money you need money. 
---
They said they would fix this in early December. Guess it was too hard to pull off in two full months 
---
Well, seeing all these negative posts and numerous „I am leaving“ threads here I must assume Fallout 76 is the best selling Game in decades ... and we all know the Reality is faaar away from that. 
---
huh?
---
Please Bethesda, pull these private servers from that magical hole in your ass so /u/ESARPE can realize how fucking dumb this post was. 
---
I thought you were serious because i agree with what you typed lol. Some of us have lower expectations and are very happy here.
---
 That said, this one affect my first nuke and i agree it should be fixed. I'm in no rush however.
---
This sub reddit is really biased btw so take the opinions with a grain of salt. If you look at the top posts for the last couple of days you’ll see about the bugs
---
Isn't that quest still bugged?
---
An apology of any form would admit fault.
---
appreciate the reply!  
---
Re #1 
---
tried both just leaving the area around, and also fast travelling to something near by and walking back.  Neither worked.  The quest did not show the area on my compass either.  
---
definitly  not user error, I have done just that in the past, and double checked it.
---
bug 2:  yes, i know i got the alert because i own the workshop, that's why i take them :P   But, i never was in the area, so i shouldn't be getting  the warning about leaving.  
---
Retake is totally easier, have let a few go to that, especially when the mobs spawn way outside and get stuck.
---
You clearly have no idea.  Do you know how big tripling a circle’s radius makes it?
---
Every time they “fix” something they break fifteen other things. The Rad Worm screwing all your status effects up is both comical and painful at the same time.  I think this is why everyone is so upset. They just have not displayed the ability to fix the game without breaking the game. About all they have been good at is nerfing the game. 
---
Yes, a respec would be even better.  Atoms was just an example of SOMETHING they could do that is easy — and yet they’re not even doing that.
---
No, but it sounds like a place I need to visit!
---
XB1S user here, reporting similar to your experience. I was plagued by VATS stuck in an infinite loop of engaging and disengaging really often and haven't had it happen since the patch and hotfix. Game crashes less than any other version so far. I do seem to be "disconnected from server" way more often in the past two weeks and I sometimes know ahead of time went chest contents won't load and eventually controls are shut off until re-connection. Doesn't seem to be better or worse since the patch, but I've only played for about 2 hours since it was added. Hoping it was a fluke. Still, don't open your pipboy until the game has fully loaded (if you spawn near your camp, wait until the camp appears on screen)
---
Agreeing with other users here: hunger, hydration, fusion cores are tanking to nothing really fast. It's not realistic to be eating and drinking literally every 5 minutes of gameplay, or going from well hydrated to parched in the same time frame. Loot drops do seem better; I got a 3 star explosive mod assault rifle off of a scorched champion in camp venture of all places last night: my first explosive round mod ever. 
---
All we need is an old lead painted refrigerator.  Then we can survive a nuke.
---
It’s not just damage being dealt. It’s a world event that’s actually changes enemies and plants, the reason why you “die” is so you don’t see the ghouls start to glow or the flora start to change
---
Given the weapon and ammo weights I would push more for it being in “heavy” rather than rifleman ... but ... that being said giving it access to perks would be awesome...
---
GET SCARED BETHESDA, A  TINY PORTION OF THE PLAYER BASE IS COMING FOR YOU WITH GOODBYE LETTERS.
---
I think any creature up to a certain size should always die to a mini nuke. 
---
Wrapped cap also prevents facewear (RIP GAS MASK + WRAPPED CAP COMBO)
---
Yeah, so I had Demolition Expert at level '10' and Grenadier at level '4'. At to that the extra rad damage from the nuka grenade knocking more of my health off because of rad worms... As I said, I think the issue is 'solved'. I just need to be more careful until they fix that issue. 
---
I was under the impression heavy guns do poorly with vats at least for the gat I only get one shot or two in before it kicks me out
---
If you dilute the Rad X you will get to keep using your mutations and still get some anti-rad protection.
---
No. Fatman is the name of the weapon so it's a proper noun.
---
I think griefers may still figure out a way to abuse it.  I believe the solution is to scale the damage as a percentage of the targets health, not the aggressor's weapon damage and perks.  Until full damage PvP is enabled, the target (player or camp) only takes 0.20 percent of its health per shot.  This means regardless of how powerful of weapon is being used, its going to take 500 shots to kill the target player or camp.  If that doesn't bring things in line, change it to 0.10 percent and up it to 1000 shots.
---
Haha. Ok dude. Go ahead and try to shame me. Not like what you think matters. My husband and I work full time and still enjoy playing this game together. I’m so sure you’re one of the *totally innocen*t handful of people that got banned. 
---
... vats misses due to twoshot mostly though if you try and fire  the instant you vats you will miss for some reason
---
 once again if your not running a build with basically any damage perks why the hell are you complaining you do no damage? That's like saying "I don't have any range on melee, this game is broken" your willingly gimping yourself due to refusing to use the systems put there so you can do great damage easily, then after gimping yourself your going onto the Reddit to claim it's broken when in reality it was just fixed, you never should of been able to clear much without at least some form of build.
---
Also, turrets not only a) Suck, but b) eat up a ton of budge. Some things are big budget hogs.
---
The fact that things with RIFLE in its name aren't affected by the rifleman perks is one of my biggest peeves with the game 
---
That's got to be a development mistake. I mean, I've never seen a game where, to make the gear, you actually need the gear! It's just so unbelievably stupid.
---
Coming to an atom store near you 
---
-disclaimer the fridge doesn't actually protect you
---
Well tell you what, I’ll check it out again when I get on (in about an hour).
---
If I see it I’ll msg you the cost towards me and u can fast travel. Maybe that will work?? FYI it was like 10.5k in caps too
---
Well my agility is 20 so I've got LOTS of AP.
---
I did some runs in lucky hole mine for lead and farmed west-tek mutants for their rifles to scrap them to steel
---
Fair 'nuff. I'd like to see more trading, but I take a warning from Path of Exile (PoE) and Diablo III (D3). 
---
PoE doesn't have an auction house, and has little in-game support for trading, which paradoxically resulted in a balanced game and economy. D3 made trading very easy, and it destroyed progression, balance and the economy.   
---
There's already lots of trading occurring. PC trades are far cheaper than NPC vendors. Serum mutations are what, 200-500 caps from other players? That's already cheap. If an auction house drove those prices down to the cost of a stimpack, I don't think that would be a good thing.   
---
An auction house is also a huge development task, and I'd rather see Bethesda put their focus into other areas. 
---
I would agree... 
---
For 7$ thats a good price. It is a buggy mess but if you want to, go ahead.
---
Thank you for the help.
---
Ah yes. The other echo chamber sub.
---
I don't think it was really a mistake. A good fallout multiplayer title is very much possible.
---
The problem is poor execution and greed.
---
This game would've benefited so much from a proper beta/pre-release phase where community feedback was actually collected and implemented.
---
The main problems besides technical issues are really that the game's mechanics, stories and events are hugely lacking in depth or quality. The game engine does have its limitations, but I really expected there to be a lot more use of the multiplayer environment than what this game has.
---
Check if your Xbox is getting hot, I have a fan blowing in mine and works great. Xbox one x and usually dies great but I have used close to my tv too which gets a little warm as well. Once I did that crashes diminished down to about none. If I forget to turn on fan it’s about an hour in and crashes. Would be interested if this works for you too. 
---
Sorry had to get off earlier than I thought. My wife had made some last minute plans. I’ll be on around the same time tonight though and should be playing throughout the weekend. 
---
I have enjoyed the game since the beta, bugs and all. 
---
If you buy it now, you will have barely made a dent in all the places there are to explore and quests there are to follow when Bethesda releases new content. 
---
It *is* still buggy, but we're making progress. One issue has been people mass replicating things using a glitch, and bethesda is coming down hard on those people. 
---
Then you were a rebel at one point in time. Steve Wilhite would like a [word](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF#Pronunciation) with you. 
---
Go find the form in the building over there and come back...
---
Well, that is cool, but I am only up to about 4K so far. I knew it was about 11k, I was just kind of preparing, and ensuring it was SOMEWHERE. But a confirmation would be cool
---
It's not an analyses, it's a response that has information. Saying I'm wrong also doesn't mean you're right. If I'm wrong, howso? 
---
How did they get level 1 haz suits I've roll seen those in nuke silos. Well you could be the hero everyone needs and just I'll them or train some scorched on them.
---
I had it trigger for me when I was not in combat, no one was around or shooting at me, AND I don't even have the perk. I was however getting the grunt of being hit and heard the smack noise of melee damage. 
---
Fair enough, but I still wonder where the problem is.  Is it the servers used to handle the logins or the server used to handle the game play?  Is it something as simple as needing to raise a timeout setting to cover a series of lost packets or is something more sinister?  I see people fussing about this all the time, and I know some very technical folks are in this community, but I have not seen where anyone has posted about troubleshooting this and I am surprised at that.
---
I'll lose 440 caps. I'll get it back after one run of golf outfits in the course lol
---
&gt;I don't think it's related to something being "turned on" at all.
---
It kinda lost its meaning (thanks in part to the very liberal use of the term "hotfix") but it definitely meant that initially. 
---
Lol I had just woken up and not had coffee. Normally I would edit but I think this one will stand lol.
---
LMF-Atoms off
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen it at BoS Watoga, but it's not consistently there for one reason or another.
---
I'm level 120 and only have gotten 6 or 7 3 star legendary weapons, 2 of which were relevant to my character's build. Killing tough enemies should result in rewarding loot, not terrible melee weapons and shitty armor pieces. The devs should really look into loot pools again. 
---
Major data losses to outsiders, not to publishers. They refuse to give any logs or data to publishers. 
---
My perspective is that your perspective sucks, not that you suck.
---
It's always helpful if one of your enemies takes care of another enemy for you. 
---
For PvP people gearing up and PvP is the content.
---
We're looking into a variety of solutions for this, but it's a little more complicated one to tackle in a way that clearly communicates the status of an active event. Since many events have different ways they can be completed or failed, a timer on the map doesn't necessarily give you all the info you'd need when deciding to travel there and some events can still be failed with plenty of time remaining on the clock. We're hearing your feedback on this though, and currently investigating how we can make this a better experience.
---
I've never seen one of these mysterious "mutation serums" everyone's always talking about.
---
You say "maybe this game is not for you", well, no one builds AAA/console game for people who only have 20 minutes to play at a time. Mobile games fill that niche. It doesn't matter if you're talking Call of Duty or Minecraft or Witcher 3. If you can only play 20 minutes, you're not the target demographic.
---
That makes it only a lil. But better he needs 2 hits not 1 and I still need probably over 100
---
I hope they have the modeler working full-time on more beds instead of coding like everyone hear seems to want them to be...
---
I had to team up to get through Whitesprings. And will team up to tackle the power station repair events and, of course the SBQ event needs teamwork. Aside from that I've been solo.
---
I haven't tried it, but my understanding is it wont work once you've completed everything. 
---
I mean fair enough but it sounds like you are just speaking up saying you have had no problems as if to flex on those who have. Fair does though hard to gather tone on reddit sometimes my bad.
---
I wanted a good FO game.  What we got was bug riddled shovelware designed to profit from microtransactions.
---
I'm not upset about them making a game I don't like.  I'm upset that this is most likely going to mean that it will be a LONG time till we see another good FO game now.
---
Sorry if my original post was too wordy for you to follow.
---
I noticed that the miner hat and gas mask work without any issues, but it’s sad it doesn’t work with these amazing masks.
---
Me either!
---
You begging Bethesda to not allow player camps in an area where lots of people place camps to quickly level to 50 = GAY
---
Fix your shit. The problems on your end. I bet youre on wifi or got some budget speed internet plan. 
---
Hard wire and beg your mother for a better internet package.
---
Thanks man :) 
---
I kinda gave my friends a disclaimer before buying the game and a couple still did, none of them play it as often as me but we have fun every now and then for what the game is LOL
---
I use VATS because my eye-hand coordination and reflexes suck.  That's why I'm usually a stealth sniper, but when I have to wade into the fray, I use VATS with the Gatling gun if the targets are close so that I hit them (and also because it seems to slow them down - especially if I target the legs).  My agility is 20, my perception is 20 and I have the 2.5X sneak damage bonus.
---
If you know what perks to wear and have some friends to help you can down her in 5 mins. Don't give up, she gives good(most of the time) loot and prime plans you can't buy. If you can get a group of people who can launch 10+ nukes a day then it's fun. It really sucks though for solo people.
---
Whoop, there it is. The "should have been singleplayer topic" of the day...
---
Yes, clearly its safer to release the data to criminals intent on harm.
---
Interesting idea! I'll discuss this with the design team. Perhaps it could also be applied not just for time remaining, but also for events where you have to do something like defend several objects and the color would update based on their remaining condition or how many have been destroyed. Thanks!
---
If you have any turrets whatsoever they eat up a ton of your budget. Even the moving spotlights. 
---
I had the same problem when I went for a huge defensive fortification but after I found out that I could get by with few or no turrets and just not pay to repair my stuff occasionally I got over it.
---
For sure check your store to tap but since you've probably already done that if your base has been sitting in the same place for a long time there are some glitches with wiring that if you scrap an item without scrapping the attached wiring the wiring will continue to affect your budget without being usable. They fixed that but I don't think it's going to show up until your base is moved or rebuilt.
---
Some friends and I have built a village someone surrounding the Gorge at junkyard area all in honor of the honorable and divine Mothman. Some of us have built some pretty huge structures with a lot of stuff in them by not building any turrets whatsoever.
---
And there goes the atom shop whine.
---
complain about the TSE nerf and you'll have the trifecta.
---
Bonus points if you make a "I'm quitting" topic.
---
can you do the same to the tins of coloured paint?  I want to update my Commie Whacker...
---
Will be when it actually lets me online and doesn't disconnect everytime
---
Are you trying to tell me ESO got off to a smooth start?.....is that really what you’re trying to say 🤦🏻‍♂️😂 
---
It does get easier.  I'm in a similar boat as you, but a little higher level @ 50.  I play solo at least 50% of the time, and I've main quested pretty much exclusively solo.  I hit a snag around one quest with Rose, I got my face kicked in.  I just went out into the world and explored for a few days until I was a little tougher and tried again.  A little further down the road I found myself in the cranberry bog unprepared....wound up completing the quest with broken weapons and shredded armor and an empty stomach, but I got it done.  Sometimes it's hard but not impossible.  Some quests you'll walk right through others you're gonna take a beating.  Just keep trying.  Playing with other people is fun though, you should give that a try as well.  
---
I'm the same and am level 140.
---
Fix all the problems in precisely the order THE GRAND COUNCIL of SUPREME GAME DESIGNERS AND PROGRAMMERS DEMANDS I. When do we want it? AS SOON AS THE THOUGHT POPPED UP IN OUR HEADS &gt;:(
---
The slanted walls will also click to the sides of foundation ramps. 
---
Bobby pins, loading screen crashes,  and this SBQ thing are all bugs I can think of, but these are bugs that never should have been in the finished game, and these constant “we’re aware of it and working on it 🤗”s are ridiculous 
---
I have this issue as well on PS4. Exact same build as OP minus the Garb. I use Shadowed Leather items instead which in theory should do the same thing.
---
The scrapping thing definitely was a headache. Suddenly plastic is a priceless commodity. 
---
They are still trying to tweak the 2SE guns. They need to buff the up a bit. The downgrade is causing players to use up a lot of ammo and a lot of scrap on gun repairs.  
---
Don't believe the drama though, when people say the game is no longer playable. 
---
* quarter exploding, one teddy bear and one leg
---
I’m not sure I understand. Can’t you take them out and drop?
---
Why would you have to keep them...?
---
Listen hear you degenerate **hater**, I'll have you know Plumbers Don't Wear Ties was *way worse* than Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing, how about you get some perspective and enjoy being able to accelerate indefinitely while driving in reverse with no collision detection at all?
---
Thank god someone let them know.
---
You promise only once? I bet you will say it again lmao ....... cause your full of something warm and fuzzy thinking about how op melee is 🤣
---
Im okay with that since they somehow need to close the distance if they wouldn’t one hit me 
---
Im even okay if meele is somehow stronger than guns but then there must be a chance to kill meele guys because at the moment you just can’t they’r tanking any guns
---
Also there should be a high risk of killing you. 
---
Who would like a Nuke Grenade ala starship troopers?
---
While there are fools who spend microtransactions of real money, Bethesda laughs in the face of everyone with the  fallout 76
---
I keep saying, Fallout 76 could be a good game, but they rushed to get money with re skins and trash in the store 
---
They have! If you go into the launcher you can download the games 
---
Yep, it will be like that. People only cry, when it's too late. They didnt learn anything from the recent past. Like Bethesda removed an ingame item and declared it as ATX item... People don't want to hear it. 
---
Yeah, nothing says lounging on he couch like a damn keyboard in your lap....
---
I had a mysterious silent insta death out of nowhere before the patch tbh, killed the SBQ mopped up the stranglers then approached her corpse for the loot then with no sound of any gun fire or enemy noises I died on the spot and the respawn button didn’t work and I was trapped in a screen spectating my own corpse until I quit game and re-logged. Health was at 50% with 50% rads but that’s how I normally run around a nuke zone usually with no problems.
---
I'd rock some Molotov cockjugs.
---
As a rule of thumb, when I am doing an event, and there is a legendary mob spawn, I will bust out a lesser weapon to do some slap damage, and throw up the 'come here' emote.  I've seen others do this in events too, it wasnt my idea.  I like this practice, and I would encourage everyone to do the same. 
---
What are you talking about? If you're tracking a quest the team sees it. He'll half the time me and my friend have to turn our other quests off to be able to tell where we are going because it shows all of ours. It will have the quest holders name next to the quest like (Mcface Punch) Death from above.
---
There must be a few of us. 50+ here too.
---
My friend did a build and he can take an artillery shell or orbital strike beacon to the face np, but not a nuke haha 
---
Take them and put them in the overseers stash box at the overseers camp or one the the mail boxes at one of the train stations ... surely someone can use them and you’ll make their day!
---
A gun that fires fallouts most deadly weapon. 
---
A car
---
Why do you have to keep them? If you know them and if you run with a normal group and they all know them, just find some low level dude and drop them in a bag in front of them. Or trash them.
---
Drop them off at your nearest Flatwood Overseer's Cache, give them to friends.  Maybe trade them if you can find someone willing to buy (new vendor prices are a bit higher, you can pawn them to players at maybe a 50% discount if you find a trader).
---
You don't have to hold onto them, if you already know them they are worthless to you.
---
The control vaults didnt fail, unless they were designed to fail. What part of experiment did you not understand? 
---
The reason its armageddon isn't so much a specific bug, its that we're now 3 months post-release and Bethesda's patches have failed to fix a large amount of bugs, introduced new bugs, tried to balance the game by using major nerfs rather than carefully considered changes.
---
Stuff like mods getting scrapped took **3 months** for Bethesda to implement and even then they end up breaking more and more stuff.
---
I think the outrage, leaving aside the quality of the game at launch, is that they consistently prove themselves as being completely incapable of issuing minor bug fixes.
---
Why would you have to keep known plans? 
---
It's extremely counterintuitive because Assaultrons don't drop them.  You have scrap the Assaultron Blade weapon, or find one in the world.
---
Yes, it's kind of stupid.
---
I was killing normal ghouls at whitesprings last night and some were dropping 1* legendaries. Rad worms punches up your mutations but once it's gone the marsupial mutation stops working. I'm still loading in to danger that I cannot see, and sneak is all messed up. I still play the game because not of that is game breaking for me, but there are more problems now than before the patch. 
---
I think this was the worst time to make this thread.
---
After the last patch, I wouldn't call the surge of complaints "slandering."
---
I'd call it "justified exasperation and exhaustion with repeated upset."
---
Why is it that multiple people can use a terminal, but multiple people can't use a vendor?
---
Maybe damage resistance is affecting the expected outcome. 
---
Explosive gatling gun, non explosive heavy gun perks? How do? 
---
That's a really good idea, that way all of the moaning and complaining on this sub can go away and we can have talk about the nicer aspects. Those who don't like how the game is going, will simply vote to change it.
---
So’s that reply 
---
This game is so weird... purifiers in camps have been buggy for a while, but this is extreme. And even if it does work the way that post suggests, I should still have 6 full purifiers after half an hour. Right now I'm lucky if I get 4 or 5 in that time.
---
Used this method in Grafton before, works every time, HeHeHe
---
25% Armor penetration, double ammo capacity, faster reload speed. Something like that. Perception is 9, I think, I don't have the game in front of me. His health went down when I crit him, but not enough to kill him. 
---
Detroit buildset: Everything is already destroyed
---
Arcade buildset: Blacklights
---
Brick buildset 2: Now with wallpaper!
---
Vault buildset: Vault-esque walls and floors, very durable but very budget constraining
---
Because you know Ruggle, there are definitely not any troll or harassment groups out there on the web, right? Ever heard of good squad?
---
They are too scared of what it might mean for PvP. 
---
Molotov cocktails work best with a certain kind of bottle. Not too big, the glass not too thick, not too wide in diameter, long bottle neck. 
---
Whiskey bottles (usually thicker glass) or Nuka bottles (no neck at all, large diameter) wouldn't work very well.
---
Well there's always hope for the future...
---
Cars are deadly like, used to love setting them off at the open air cinema in fo3 lol
---
&gt; Nuance and subtility please.
---
Nothing more nuanced or subtle than OP screaming about how everyone who criticizes this game doesn't matter and isn't being listened to because they aren't the game's "core playerbase", whatever that means.
---
just take it for what it is, copy and paste bullshit, if you don't expect anything from it you will be less disappointed when they fail to deliver, again.
---
It isn't new though it has happened since the beta
---
You see ivan Vauit-Tec, spell with capitol I so the capitalist dogs will not see the imperials coming. 
---
You can’t be serious hahah
---
Posted a ticket at support 190201-001583 for /u/ladydevann
---
You’re not wrong. 
---
My non PA build has around 400-500 depending on if I'm in a group or not (strange in numbers, scaly skin etc).
---
Probably going to drop barbarian for blocker since its ghouls that are fucking me up and I play with about 10% hp
---
My CAMP for this character is an abandoned strip club, so, Neon letters are pretty much a requirement. It just doesn't look the same without them. But, it makes sense, West Virginia has tons of legendary clubs, from the infamous "wagon whee" to classier places. But my club, Foxxxes, will be amazing! 
---
Legendary Mirelurk Queen. I’ve heard the stories. Yet to experience the fury.
---
It's more a matter of you having low standards compared to other people TBH.
---
I agree with Mazzn - prior to patch I could reliably two shot monsters up to lvl 62 with my bog standard hunting rifle.  post patch I can't even get close enough to take the sneak shot.  Additionally, in mob rush, I can only pop one before the entire rest of the group knows where I am (even with Chameleon armor and escape artist)
---
I had a beautiful moment in 76 yesterday where a chain reaction of car related mayhem happened
---
I see where you are going. We can make guns from desk fans and tape but we cannot break down other ammo and pour the powder into a different shell? Excess ammo is such a pain I drop mine off in a suitcase in Morgantown Train Station from time to time just so a newbie might find it and make his/her day.
---
I have 4 turrets so it’s probably that cheers 
---
"we stuck a vault full of drugs that make your paranoid and didnt secure any of the weapons locks" its not like they didnt expect it to fail. 
---
Anyone play Elite back in the day?
---
You really need to find out what you like doing.  Guns are fun but have been breaking quickly.  Melee is always good, keep a melee weapon on you to help save up ammo or to just use...
---
How? I’m taking about the damage numbers in the pip boy btw.
---
It's called private servers because you can host it yourself, lol
---
If you look at the individual pieces of armor it will give you a breakdown of how much protection you'll actually receive.
---
There is nothing in game, including the hazmat suit, that gives you 100% protections from catching rads.
---
:,( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,
---
This is when I would shoot the door down and drop a few orbital strikes on the first floor and waltz away in to the night.
---
&gt;y 
---
I'd agree that it isn't unplayable but the scrapping changes make bulking and inventory management a huge chore and it's such a stupid change that just wastes people's time and resources for no benefit at all.
---
The problem with balance changes (like TSE) is that they continue to issue patches which change values by huge amounts instead of actually making considered changes.
---
A lot of the TSE issues were actually caused by bobblehead stacking which Bethesda seem to have ignored.
---
So while not unplayable, I can totally see that at the moment it's just not worth the effort to play this game.
---
290/390/50. All Heavy Boss Combat except 1 trapper arm.  
---
Different types of objects maybe? Terminals are a specific mini game, vendors are NPCs.
---
Did not realize this, even at lvl 145 lol. Just thought Rad-x all together muted the mutations temporarily. 
---
I use radicol though for the extra damage buff, so some rads are nice. When You're fighting ghouls though and need to pop a rad away after , kind of inconvenient. Not game breaking but annoying for sure.
---
I live in Virginia, but I've been to WVA enough to know that this is absolutely the case. 
---
Working as intended most likely. When in water or a hazardous environment you should get a message that your armor prevented you getting a disease or something along those lines. You'll also get significantly less rads in PA but it won't be 0. 
---
Yeah, even if the "bonus-per-group" perks capped at 4, it would be nice to have 6 players in a group. It's particularly needed given how accidental friendly fire works (e.g. requires toggling pacifism). The fifth player is really vulnerable to friendly turret agro. 
---
I'm 38, my oldest is 19.
---
I use a PS4, he uses a PC.
---
You are over generalizing and over explaining to push your point but it doesn't matter, with the average age of games PC or console being 35, the original statistics still hold true. You dont have to believe the numbers, but they are quoted all over the internet.
---
Now you might be 85 years old, and you being the exception as a geriatric can say all us "young folks", and talk about how it was "back in your day" and make claims about how we dont get it I suppose, but the average gamer never used a comador 3000. 
---
And calling your age group an arbitration to statistics then claiming you make up a lot of the FO community is funny, the problem is YOU regard YOU as average, so you ignore statistical fact to insert your own opinion based on your experience. 
---
Wow check out this guy that didn't like the objectively, factually amazing game Plumbers Don't Wear Ties. I bet you either never actually played it or just didn't pay attention to what it was all about. Tell you what, if you hate that game so much why even talk about it, huh? Let the rest of us enjoy our live action, western eroge in peace.
---
Never tried going for a full hp build?
---
and only for 190 caps too, it's a bargain.
---
By my math it should be 208 with Gatling gun + 60% Gunner Perks.
---
Add 60% Explosive damage = 332.8 per shot (prior to factoring in Bloodied and Adrenal Reaction + Increased rate of fire)
---
Bloodied: Does more damage the lower the user's health is. (5% damage per 5% health lost)
---
Adrenal Reaction: 20% &lt;	+150%
---
Numbers begin to reach point of absurdity in consideration of the speed of the Gatling gun (with its 500 bullet magazine)
---
Only do this if rad suits no longer block armor usage.
---
Had a moment like that too last night, it sent a scorch corpse flying off into the unknown, I have no idea where it landed lol
---
*shrugs* look in the "World" achievements section. It gives you broadly where to find all her tapes. I ended up finding most by accident since I just wander the map a lot.
---
Turn it upside down until then and enjoy it 
---
/r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Check this out.
---
I am more concerned about three star enemies not dropping three star loot.
---
PA will reduce rads, but not completely eliminate them. Better PA has higher rad resistance, like X-01. Hazmat Suit has the best rad resistance. As for disease. I guess it is a bug, or maybe it isn't, I have no idea.
---
You have a little something...on your face....right there....all over your chin.....what is that?
---
Yea I know. They said from the beginning that they were working on it. That it would hopefully be ready in a year or so. I still can’t figure out why everyone that rushed through the game thinks they deserve some type of catering by the company. 
---
The game is fine. The new content will be fine. Don’t fall for the circle jerk echo chamber
---
I can't speak to post-patch. I just know that even with a high-end agility and all the sneak skills, I could never do more than one or two stealth shots before I had the entire camp of whatever charging me. The only time I could reliably sneak was when my teammates were blowing things up off to the side and attracting all of the monsters.
---
But maybe I'm just overly grumpy about sneaking because I've been replaying Wildlands and that game allows for 'real' stealth missions.
---
Agreed, that subreddit is great if you want to make posts about how empowered you feel now that you're on a subreddit where you don't have to see people being mean to Bethesda.
---
Most of the posts on that subreddit are just talking shit about this subreddit and public displays of very awkward "gamer empowerment"
---
Radiation resistance in power armor is enough to where you won’t get sick over a long period of time, but yes, you aren’t impervious to it completely. 
---
Power Armor does indeed protect you from diseases, but it only does so with airborne and waterborne diseases, but not from any disease you may get from diseased creatures.
---
True words.
---
Interesting. I'm basically halfway to your build, but might tweak it around a bit.
---
The tease they gave us in the Inside the Vault yesterday mentions a buff to heavy weapons in the near future as well.
---
So you are attacking people actually giving constructive feedback to a fuckin CM. ROFL
---
Hey I ain’t EASY lmao. ...your the one who has been making all the assumptions about me  in every post and now I make one about you to make a point of it and you start glitching out ... lmao 
---
No shit you weren't alive. 
---
Its the happening for centuries part that informs innate bias and systems that were built during that time that still today benefit the kind of people the designed the system in the first place. 
---
Example, an industry that excludes women historically is likely to make decisions or ignore problems that weren't their problem two hundred years ago.
---
Including marginalized people lets us see things from their perspective and look the things we might not have realized if we hadn't asked. Sexism isn't just going to go away but identifying aspects of it and looking into how it hurts people will help as well as acknowledging that their issues sometimes stem from history before we were so "woke". 
---
You aren't at fault for setting up the system but if you get mad when when they're included you have to expect them to get mad when you say everything is equal and they've been shut out.
---
The reading FO76 has so many issues is because some asshole, more than likely a corporate asshole who doesn't actually play game and signs everyone's check, pushed for a quick release. Zenimax media own the title. I'd blame
---
 Robert A. Altman(chairman, CEO) James L. Leder(president, COO) Cindy L. Tallent(EVP, CFO). 
---
Surprise! Lol. See you around in Appalachia.
---
Born and raised in WV.  
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
You're good my man
---
Awesome! Thanks 😁
---
I agree.  It's more a culmination of thoughtless mistakes, the perpetual effort to "balance" the game by increasing the grind and slowing it down, and concerns about the future than any one thing in Patch 5.
---
That and, well, for some reason we're getting a PvP mode before new PvE content.  Let alone fixes for PvE content.
---
Yeah, I uninstalled and reinstalled last night and was able to log in and play for a little bit.
---
Now I just need to download the updated mod.
---
All mixed and match, no major stat changers like bloodied/unyeilding. +25 rad from the Trapper Piece. I do have grounded mutation for +100 energy dmg, and chest piece has asbestos lining. Sorry not in game, so o can't be more specific.
---
Nah, not yet, but it's getting there!  It's been kind of relaxing not playing it this month, and I got a chance to do something I've never done before - play Skyrim! :) 
---
Random's wasn't counting the passive mothman, I've done that event a couple times.
---
I liked arks idea, just not its game play. 
---
I do like not losing all my stuff in game, but I miss base raiding.
---
No, unyielding and radicool give me ~20+ STR for carry weight (I only have 2 point in str). I have over 30 agility and luck, just under 30 Per. I can stay in sneak and vats all day long and kill everything with constant sneak crits.
---
I also play low HP because my weapon are bloodied and I run adrenal reaction with means even more damage - my gauss does around 900 damage after the nerfs
---
I often think about if they had of just delayed the game to add a bit more polish how people would be talking today about F76. Some people were always going to dislike it but I maybe the hate train would not have been as severe if they delayed it by 5-6 months before full launch. Sliding doors and all that. 
---
I think Todd and Pete are going to get shelved by Zenimax or that they're going to try and bring out someone else as their public face.
---
$100 says the person they use as their new public face is a minority and we get some shpiel about empowerment or something dumb.
---
YEP!!! Thirsty all the time. Much faster since patch.
---
Don't you have a circlejerk to get back to?
---
Finally a voice a reason. 
---
Yeah, I've had this happen too.  Get done with a fight, fast travel back home, no enemies anywhere around my base........still in caution or danger status.  Sometimes it doesn't even show caution or danger, but the reason I know I am is my Healing Factor mutation doesn't work.  At some point it ends, because I can see Healing Factor kick back in.  Usually about 5 mins later.
---
Nice, nice. I've been lucky enough to find marine &amp; combat Vanguard pieces for each piece, which helps quite a bit !
---
Ya, these posts are kind of stupid especially when they said at E3 that it was a test to see how people like it. They act like they ruined the series by making it multiplayer but it's not going to happen again. Especially since Bethesda is devoted to making 76 a long term game. 
---
And not to mention it's not the first multiplayer fallout game.
---
Yes. 
---
The same thing the circlejerk on this sub is about to get covered in.
---
It would be cool if joinable-factions also has a base-of-operations with free-travel for a place to meet and coordinate, though it would be hard to ensure that there wasn't a "best faction" based upon which faction had the best location. 
---
To that end, Mistress of Mysteries should have given free fast travel back to the hideout once you had a rank in the organization. Oh well. Ideas. 
---
I just turn on the Benny Hill theme music before I log in. As i'm typing this i'm realizing most of you will have no idea who/what Benny Hill is...damn i'm getting old. 
---
Ya but right now, YOU have to search them out, so it being SOOO important that you went looking for support they at least glance over the comments. 
---
Thank you for this!
---
There are only a couple things that you can bulk or sell loose.  Screws is one of them.  Just about everything else either can be sold loose and cannot be bulked, or cannot be sold loose and must be bulked to sell.  I think the screws are actually a bug because springs and gears must be bulked to sell.
---
 well in what sense? , it's a grinding simulator 
---
PS4, same issue here.
---
Lvl 3 Sneak
---
15 Agility (24 with mutations and armour)
---
Chameleon Armour pieces
---
Muffled/Sleek armour mods
---
I mean this character is built entirely for sneaky-sneaky, but it is completely broken and I can demonstarte that every single time I go back to camp.
---
My camp is on the roof of Hornwright Corporate Headquarters (well technically IN the roof, the only part of my camp visible to the outside world is a Red Rocket Sign I placed on the roof, my camp is inside... kind of, it's like a penthouse, my friends call it Stank Tower). Very occasionally, a single scorched who lives on the top floor of the shanty houses leaning against it will aggro my Red Rocket Sign on the roof. My single turret kills him and I can be at Camp in complete peace.
---
Post-patch the level 3 feral ghouls who are on the ground floor are keeping me in constant danger status. I can get to my camp, but I can never leave.
---
As well as every single other place I have been, constantly being spotted easily. 
---
Pre-patch I fast traveled to Robco to do AWOL Armaments. Behind my arrival point were a bunch of lvl 52 Gutsies. Once I;d loaded in I watched 3 lvl 68 Supermutants Overlord/Warlords come running straight towards me, almost barge me out of the way and fight the Gutsies behind me. A couple of charred feral ghouls followed them a moment later.
---
I was hidden the entire time, and not 
---
[   Hidden   ]
---
but 
---
[                    Hidden                    ]
---
The *entire* time
---
Now? NO CHANCE! I can't even remain completely still and invisible without being spotted by some low level mob.
---
Where did u get those? Queen or event?
---
See you again for the next patch when people cause the end of the world because they built their character around a glitch or something.
---
Yep, welcome to gring RNG.
---
Even if you get something from a 3 star enemy, it's likely to be a 1 star wood leg that's under your level.
---
Uranium Fever isn't even worth running anymore.  All that hassle and 100% of the legendary drops are useless unless you're level 40 or below.
---
Technically, the 16"/50s on  Iowa class battleships are rifles, and while i would love to tote one around Appalachia, I would definitely file it under heavy.
---
Fair enough, I was thinking about going for a Unyielding setup, but cant be bothered to respec everything, since I went to other was than you, going full Vanguard.
---
Many of them are apparently also unfamiliar with the issues that most survival mmos experience on release, just because they're a large studio doesn't make them immune.
---
Random drops, took ages to get them all tho !
---
Yes, but you have to be *seen* jumping on the band wagon, that gets you more kudos with the in-crowd.  
---
Have you noticed the posts on r/fallout crowing about how r/Fo76 has "seen the light"?
---
True.  Though I imagine they \*should\* be able to implement *something* that would allow multiple people to access a vendor at the same time.  I don't see that as an immersion breaking thing...
---
question side question, garb of mysteries doesn't conflict w cameleon mutation?
---
There is no next Skyrim lol. Noob. 
---
Melee is the MOST viable you mean. As its OP as hell since beta.
---
Nice read, some very good ideas on how to balance. 
---
Thought of one problem with a part of It, player vendor machines being indestructible, players will abuse this at workshops by placing them in front of the table stopping anyone from claiming it because you can't damage the vending machine
---
Ooo, that sounds like fun, count me in. I’ve been dying to try out a few new weapons in my arsenal on the Queen.
---
...now where’d I place all that steel and lead for ammo?
---
Huh? 
---
Yeah they  feel so bad shot a fat man at a mirelurk queen same way I use to in Fo4 and it did absolutely nothing to her I actually thought I missed so I got closer and fired I died and it did 1/25 damage to her!?
---
Paint job from the Atom store*
---
I painted my T-51b with Nuka World from the hidden questline and there is no atom :( 
---
Okay, fair point LOL. I guess as long as weapons fall under some category that's benefitted by perks I wouldn't mind. 
---
I took a shot. Went for the top. I played for keeps but look what it cost.
---
Because democracy **is non-negotiable**.
---
No one will care about a 53% rated AAA-production title in a year man. They either fix it now (and radically) or it's done for good. 
---
Love it! I also want to be able to put bobby pins in a junk jet and staple a feral ghoul to a wall lol
---
Behind the ghoul clubhouse at the white springs there is a trash can near the golf carts.  It is full of trash.  A lot of it is plastic.
---
That explanation makes sense until you consider that there’s no guarantee that the person offering to mod it will ever give it back. There’s no way to even confirm that someone has the plans before trading them stuff. The risk is too high. 
---
If players who had plans for T60 jet packs for example, could craft standalone mods instead of just modifying the item directly, they could sell those and take out the risk. 
---
Nah, just make it more scarce. This a sci fi / fantasy but even then missile launchers should not be common to find an neither the ammo, they should be stronger than any other type of weapon though.
---
Oh, hey! A bit off topic, but something I've been wondering since the Vault-Tec DLC for Fallout 4: 
---
Howcome the backlit posters don't also come as "plain" posters, like the Vault posters, and vice versa? I'm sure there is a reason, I would just really appreciate hearing what it is. 
---
You despise hoarders because....? 
---
Wasn´t there also a perk that increases strenght with high rads? should be going pretty well to keep your health at a low percentage and heal yourself with the health regen mutation.
---
They need to focus on fixing the game first. 
---
Pretty much the point I'm at. Can't craft anything stronger in weapons or armor. Just playing the RNG game now. I have done a few trades, but TBH I already had trust issues with online games, so the dupe/ban thing prevents me from really doing anymore.
---
Well done!
---
If there was a vanguard weapon and a vanguard mutation where you did max damage at max hp and it dropped as your hp did I'd be all over that. I would main vampiric! But right now you just get more DR, which is more like the opposite of bolstering.
---
Low hp I also get nerd rage which buffs my damage and DR.
---
What's your DR?
---
&gt;Both of our experiences are real and valid and I think that's where the disconnect can come in between people that see the game as nothing but a bug laden mess and people that feel like that's blown out of proportions. The game has real problems but the severity of those varies person to person.
---
Exactly! You get it 
---
I've had a few problems throughout my playing time.  Nothing that would make me want to quit.
---
However my friends are BORED to death.  My friends list says "offline, offline, offline, offline" more and more now.
---
We need some CONTENT mixed in with "bug fix / bug creation palooza" patches.
---
i always have dysentery
---
Enclave bunker
---
Jesus Christ these posts are so cringey.
---
First!
---
There is a funeral home in flatwoods that usually has some. Also I think the halloween party shack at the fairgrounds, the halloween ranger tower, and possibly the pumpkin house and freddie fears house of scares.
---
I have had the same problem with my stealth build, very similar build to the ones I use in every Fallout and Elder Scroll game. A week ago I had a level 50 scortch beast just sit in front of me for a minute or two and couldn't see me, now I'm spotted as soon as mobs spawn and attacked from behind barriers that I can't target through but seem to get hit from the mob behind them. I was even in a basement with mobs upstairs and was taking damage from attacks.
---
Why did this take 3 months to write?
---
As the game evolves it will become more balanced.  I suppose you have to be patient?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
Um...just to clarify, there is no Blitz perk in 76. The teleport range is actually pretty close and sometimes buggy.
---
Cranberry Bog. The Glade. It's horrible 
---
I was worried for days when I crafted a bunch of handmades to scrap earlier this week. I mostly avoid crafting these days. I also took what was on my mule and distributed it across multiple alts because I know folks who had legit mules with around 3-5k weight who got banned and mine was pushing 2k
---
THANK YOU. THIS x 1,000,000
---
Not in the patch notes so it could be unintentional, but my guess is they did it screw with dupers and they won't hot fit it.  I expect you may need a new character.  I don't think a lot of people would be in the same situation (having a stack of 2000 clothing items in a stash box).  
---
I'd say that unless there's a star next to the enemy's name (including ones disguised under the disguised icon) there's about a 15-25% chance that they won't drop anything legendary.
---
Sometimes when the server is slow, you may have to wait up to a minute or two for the loot to fully populate.  The legendary items always seems to slow up last.  If you didn't get anything, give it a bit and check again.
---
Elder scrolls online is actually a great example. Everyone hated it when it came out but now it's one of the top MMOs. 
---
Although they are very different games both got bad release for the same reason. They where not enough like there counterparts.
---
Now that I'm happy they hotfixed the hullaballoo, this is something that does need to be addressed. It feels really weak to hit a level 35 mole miner in the face with a rocket launcher and only have it knock off half heath. Or now, tossing a plasma grenade (my goddamn favorite explosive effect other than fatman) has ...well, it seems the splash is reduced  now or I'm just a little nuts? 
---
This is correct 
---
Let me rephrase. Wouldn't *Fatmen* be funnier?
---
Would love a Vanguard weapon ! I'm not online right now, but It's in the high 500's.
---
It was addressed yesterday by the official Bethesda account in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alo0gk/bethesda_if_you_make_the_red_tactical_headlight/efg9j18/?context=1000). They know about it, it was unintentional, and they're working on it. 
---
I'm aware of that. They aren't balancing correctly. But making everything OP isnt going to help anything. Making the "bad" weapons better is what needs to happen. BUT the VAST majority of TSE I've seen come in the form of shotguns, handmades, miniguns, and 50 cals.  You could argue that the minigun sucks without it, but keeping all those guns the way they are with old TSE wasnt the way to go. All the other ones are fine with other modifiers. 
---
Nice!  I am jonesing for the tomahawk plans!
---
There are soooo many beer bottles at train stations. But yes, the design of the Molotov is a Vodka bottle and its annoying. 
---
Don’t build turrets. I build in the forest so I don’t reappy need them I get 1-2 attacks every session. Usually a level 3 scorched or level 1 rat.
---
Thank you - useful to know it's possible.
---
I've noticed that if I check it and don't see it, I'll do some rounds and come back to it. Occasionally it \*still\* doesn't have one, but for the most part one has popped up.
---
Do agree that chainsaw too needs a little love and affection, it looks cool but damage wise it needs a tune up
---
As a level 56 who wanders around with a Brotherhood Recon Rifle that I made dressed in Deep Pocketed Combat Armor that I made, I approve this message.
---
Beer bottles are typically plentiful. There are some locations where you can pick up almost 40 bottles in one sitting, however they do weight 1 pound I think. Being able to use glass would save on space and being able to use any bottle would make other bottles more relevant. I'm personally fine with keeping it at beer bottles but I know where you're coming from. 
---
mb, but no way it should be fatman \_apostrophe\_ s.
---
I see white knighting for BGS is returning to the sub... That's cool. I guess, the usual suspects can get back to reassuring each other that Daddy Bethesda still loves us by defending software that crashes.
---
But if you think $60 is chump change to everyone in the world, you are one privileged person, lol. Some people can only afford one new game every few months. They picked this one, and many of them feel scammed. Why would they suspect that this specific game would be the joke of a whole console generation? No one expects to be fooled that badly. In fact, it is easier to fool someone than to help someone realize that they have been fooled. It's embarrassing.
---
Just because $60 means nothing TO YOU doesn't mean it is not a kind of serious amount of cash to others. You are happy with your purchase, that's great. But don't tell normal, not rich people not to complain. You don't know what their personal finances are like.
---
Which reminds me, isn't that getting some big new expansion soon?
---
It's almost like they were incapable of learning from other studios mistakes. 
---
The only thing I have outside my camp other than purifiers is a stash box for passers by lol. But you’re right, I think I will remove the turrets.
---
Just start hiting them 
---
Yeah.  I sort of couldn't tell the difference (it's kind of subjective) so I figured I'd ask here.
---
Updates were always going to be free.
---
For that to happen, they'd have to re-think and  re-do a lot of content they consider vital. Some of the grinding is understandable, some just isn´t. Things like weapon and armor condition, there's a reason they got rid of it in FO4 and Skyrim. Instead of adding fun things to do through actual content, they just added mindless grinding.
---
Games like Diablo are pretty much about grinding, but they happen to make it fun. If you spent a day playing Diablo and didn't find a single useful item, it'd be just as dull as what we are seeing now in FO76.
---
Some other things they just over-thought. The trading system in Fallout 1 and 2was pretty much perfect. Now you have to go back and forth through the least intuitive system in the history of computer games. Remember: "Less is more".
---
Regarding camps. Is there any way that when clicking on a camp to "repair all", it can repair what you have supplies for and skip those you cant repair. 
---
For example my camp tells me I need steel and wood and 12 corn (even though I only have 6 corn plants).
---
It will not repair anything until I get the required corn, even though I have the steel and wood for the other repairs. 
---
It would be nice for it to fix what it can, and let you fix the other items later. 
---
So your saying a nuclear weapon shouldn't be much weaker than a axe.  Not fair to Melee users, we need their version of balance.
---
Yep, been there. My best tip for you is as follows:
---
1. Turn on console/computer
---
2. Start up Fallout 76
---
3. Begin Login process
---
4. Leave console/computer
---
5. Get a drink
---
6. Get a snack
---
7. Use the washroom
---
8. Sit down at the kitchen table
---
9. Pen a few chapters in that book you've been working on 
---
10. Realize it's late and go to bed
---
11. Wake Up
---
12. Shower
---
13. Eat Breakfast
---
14. Go to work
---
15. Deal with Carol and all of her annoying demands and cringey talk about her "fur babies"
---
16. Come home
---
17. Fallout 76 should be logged in and ready to play
---
Yeah ok,  they broke everything about  the character I spent 200 hours  building.  Get bent.....game  sucks  now  no way I am  starting over.  
---
Anti armor depends on perks you are running and the enemy.  It is arguably the best one you listed though.  I'm not sure of too many people who are shooting at limbs either (why do +50% on a limb when you can do double hitting a weak spot?), and how often are you criting in VATS? Other than shotguns, you aren't criting every shot. 
---
And bloodied can stack up hig numbers. But you have to invest a whole lot of perk points and run around almost dead, so it does have its downsides to make it viable. I cant say I'm super experienced with this build though. 
---
Not a bad idea at all!
---
&gt;All the objects that we could have in Fallout 4 for free
---
*Communism is the very definition of failure.*
---
I have trouble telling. I come across so much meat from killing sombixes all I typically do is sit down at a cooking station and spew out about 15 meats at a time. As far as liquids I pick up all the alcohol I come across and purified water. Additionally the purified water from my camp. If it wasn't for the perk Traveling Pharmacy i'd be unable to even walk! (Exaggeration).  Also, if you through your purified water and newly made meals on a hotkey you'd probably not be bothered by it as much.
---
Recently picked up the Carnivore mutation and now I can drop most of my meat since my feeding bar fills up so fast after eating.
---
I'm in! I can bring a crew or I'm always down to kill things with new people. What day and what time? I'm on est 
---
I agree with about all you said, but they haven't had "nothing but success", granted it's been that was since Morrowind but they nearly went bankrupt making that game. 
---
I think that if they approached their updates like the Sea Of Thieves developer- Rare, gamers would be able to see the humanity and effort behind the content updates. The lack of transparency is really making it seem like Bethesda doesn't care. 
---
Solution: get a gun that launches gas pumps at enemies.
---
My friend has an AMD processor and he went into his Power settings on his computer and changed it to power saving mode. After that he did not crash anymore or lag. He has a really powerful PC and graphics card so it did not make sense for his game to lag or crash.
---
Try that and see if it fixes it.
---
Why cringey?  Perhaps if we can figure out why some people's gaming experiences are riddled with bugs and other people's aren't then it would go a long way toward Bethesda releasing patches that are consistent across all platforms, connection types, etc to ensure that *everyone* has a better experience
---
It's time to go apprehend red chinese communists ***WITH DEADLY FOOOORCE!!!!!***
---
Requested mine nine days after launch.
---
after 2 hours no crashing, I wasnt having crashing problems before though, and it seems like an improvement, my graphics card is a 1060 3gb
---
I think the main problem isn’t necessarily melee, it’s one shots. It’s not good to have PvP with easy one shotting in any game unless it’s Goldeneye with only golden guns and grapples.
---
This requires Bethesda to take a close look at what is causing these situations and decide if they need to address the items, effects or whatever that enables them, OR perhaps a different solution is needed, like recategorize PvP damage or a blanket PvP damage reduction, like Diablo 2 did. 
---
But like a lot of games, we’ve run into an issue where players need piles of damage to deal with enemies with hundreds to thousands of HP, in other words they have lots of DR and HP that players don’t have. This imbalance means PvP and PvE will never be balanced right, without addressing this issue directly.
---
If Bethesda just keeps nerfing the flavor of the week, it’ll only ever partially address an issue that will always continue to make PvP bad, or even worse they’ll screw up everything so while it’ll take several hits to kill another player, it’ll take hundreds to kill PvE enemies.
---
I'd also like to be able to just leave them out at my C.A.M.P. (or anywhere for that matter.). I absolutely loathe being forced to carry it around or store it in my inventory when I'm not wearing it. 
---
While my character started as a sneak sniper, over time it has evolved over many play styles to be half-melee, half-sniper using adrenal/nerd/blocker/lone wanderer/unyielding.   I am very fragile but the damage output makes sniping deadly, and in melee viable with a fast swing speed weapon.  
---
If only you could place the Strip Miner sign from Camden Park there. 😂
---
It seems like real life to me, but I also typically eat 6-10 bowls of soup every time I travel. 
---
according to them, the store was for future dlc .... 
---
Thank you for this and it is appreciated but why do posts like this not show up on the official forums?  I'm not disparaging reddit, it's a great site but it seems like important announcements should show up on both forums.
---
This. Man I'm so tired of shit posts because at the end of the day, I still enjoy just loading into that world that they've built and going exploring. They'd have to have a round-the-clock team creating new content to appease these guys playing ten hours a day every day. 
---
Dupers dupe things that have value so they can make money. Anybody duping stimpacks isn't out to ruin the game. I still disagree with duping but I don;t think someone should be banned from various video  games just for duping on an online game.
---
Love the ideas, especially the one that brings scorch beasts down to the ground!
---
fuck.... i didnt know this was a thing
---
I'm one of your "try-hards(?)" and I'm not upset :-)
---
I take personal responsibility in extracting as much enjoyment out of Fallout 76, as it is at any given time or state of buggy-ness. Thanks for the post!
---
I enjoyed it as well,  it after a few months there’s just nothing much to do.  Hoping for more content in the future.  
---
Do you at least have chicken? 
---
Yeah but people enjoy the game so that negates all of the glaring issues and any negative feedback /s
---
Bring back the junk jet! I was launching anything in a room at creatures. It was Like check out these bowling pins and gold flip lighter i just headshot dude with. Then loot the corpse and get your flip lighter back. 
---
Yeah... the one time I tried that I got spawn camped by a d\*\*\*head with a TSE Shotgun (pre-nerf). I'm not sure it was even his base.
---
YMMV.
---
Power armor will prevent airborne and waterborne diseases, but you can still get diseases from creatures.
---
Every time I think to myself "hey maybe I'll actually give Fallout 76 a try and buy it" a new controversy comes out like this and then im like. Nawwwwww I'm not going to be this poor soul.

"but guiiesss its FALLOUT!!!"
---
Serious question,  if any other game studio or even some unheard of Indie Developer came out with a game like this with as many problems and drama as it has, would you still play it?  Do you only play because Bethesda has lockdown on the "Falllout"  franchise? If a blue vault suit wearing pipboy wasnt included would you have given up on this game?    
---
up to what point ? 
---
I also build against a cliff. So it narrows their attack point.
---
Picked mine up in Harpers ferry but I've heard that a few vendors are selling them.
---
^^^^^^^ this time's a 100.
---
I don’t think there’s people that actually enjoy FO76. 
---
Yes i wish the favorted items could be listed last and would require an extra confirmtion
---
If they wanted to make the purified water recipe relevant.......
---
They shouldn't have made it something so rare that it's like finding ballistic fiber.
---
I have yet in 400 hours to find out where to get Bleached Dogwood.  You'd think I'd stumble upon it at least once and go "oh crap, here's where the dogwood is".  Nope, not once.
---
I'm not even going to bother googling it.  Water purifiers beat the recipe hands down, no contest.
---
FFS Bethesda don't nerf water purifiers.  I know you're a fan of throwing away things people like, please stop.
---
I'm not sure your assessment  seems likely. Players obviously thought this patch was the absolute tipping point for them. Multiple posts reached the front page citing specifically the issues the patch caused. Posts werent titled "the progress over the last 3 months have reached a tipping point". They were specifically talking about  patch 5. 
---
Also theyve certainly fixed bugs such as the water purifier in workshop Inventory, tesla rifle particle effect crash, and the explosive damage bug. Its disengenuous to imply they havent fixed anything. 
---
This may not be a popular opinion, but assuming these were the only two issues, this was a huge over reaction by the community for bobby pin weight and a handful of lost plastic. Compared to real issues like duping or the trade exploit, these are minor issues that wouldnt cause any harm aside from a 5minute run to a highschool for plastic. 
---
"Hey guys, you know that game *other studio* made that you didn't work on and know nothing about? Don't do those things."
---
1000% agree with the original post.  Duper’s were not just duping the TSE weapons, they were also duping all the best Melee weapons and they are way way way WAY too OP.  Please dispense your wasteland justice evenly and fairly and NERF Melee into oblivion.

Perhaps you could include score marks on the diamond? Simpler than adding more text

I had little experience on that question so rather than guess and give you wrong info I’ll just say I dunno. I did have a two shot laser rifle that broke after two full mags lol.
---
try moving your camp and then relogging and see if anything appears. 
---
Too bad you don't know patching software is a hell of a lot more complicated than updating a spreadsheet. They didn't build the new patch using an old version of the game, the patches failed to merge and reverted some of the changes the previous patch made.

Has Flatwoods Man gone too far?
---
This idea is stupid, just imagine building your first camp and not having the materials or plans to build a shelter. This would be super frustrating for new players!
---
Yes. I must see the horror for myself.
---
I'm sure the criminals just asked for the data and it was willingly handed over. Not like the criminals hacked accounts, games, or servers. No one ever does that. 
---
Really though. There have been much more extensive lists made on this subreddit alone. 
---
Adding issues that have already been addressed only makes it look like Bethesda is fishing for any kind of compliment. And telling us that they are "looking into" things that have been posted dozens of times over, is just another ho-hum response.
---
On a positive note, the event timer thing kind of makes sense.
---
Yes, because they aren't allowed do research into communities of other games to see what issues plagued those games at the start.  
---
It’s not worth playing if it was free
---
"Coming soon to the atom store - All new ammo reskins for the missile launcher and fatman!" - Bethesda, probably.
---
Just wondering, what 'visceral sense of agency' do you get in FO76? You don't get to choose anything, your character is a tool to be used by long-dead quest givers. There is no argument, no reasoning, no bargaining with a dead man or a holotape.

Off topic:  y’all recommend dodgy or serendipity for my next three-point investment?
---
I hear what you say, I see what you do
---
I know everything, I need to know about you
---
I agree that there needs to be a way to respec your character other than power leveling to move one point each level.
---
They should either do an event, but limit it so a character can only do it once a week or once a month; or have a respec serum that can be bought for a hefty sum of caps. Maybe from the whitesprings bunker?
---
Not sure if this is related, but I have found that I'm sometimes marked as in Danger for seemingly no good reason. On a few occasions it has turned out to be a molerat who was angry with me but too scared to come out and fight, but most of the time the Danger persists even after I've walked all the way into another valley or so, with no mole rat in evidence. 
---
Level 10-50 is a hard time.  You want to explore, yet you're not powerful enough for some areas.
---
If you see enemies that are over your level, that means a higher level player got there first.  Go to another area with nobody in it and they'll scale back down to you.
---
If you're running out of meds and materials, drop back down into the forest region to farm a bit.  You'll keep gaining levels while you farm.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Holy cow I never checked my carnivore to see if it was adding the extra bonuses! I just saw that it filled up my hunger bar faster and left it at that! thanks for the info. I also have a high number of mutations but felt that scaly skin wouldn't work for me because I have low AP.
---
Yea so what if they are overpowered almost 3 months of us building our characters on those weapons. Just buff everything so we dont feel like we lose anything
---
Mine’s like a barn, basically. It’s raised up off the ground on one set of concrete foundations and is otherwise 3x3 square locked skill 3 with a little unlocked jut out in the back with a bed and stash box for people who stop by.
---
As a player that didnt have a tse anything, only a two shot shotgun, and an explosive lever action, they are not overstating anything with this nerf
---
It's stable enough to play and enjoy.  The main negative is there are aren't reasons to play it it a super long time, and its mostly a Melee game now.  So you enjoy shooters more maybe avoid it.
---
People are also claiming the " weight bug" is back, whatever that is.
---
that spawn bug looks like its because the player is standing next to a door and the enemy is pathing between cells. 
---
That’s the list?  Maybe search this sub for the 100 known issues. 
---
Yeah this explains the abysmal damage 
---
The bug fixes are on the whole insubstantial.
---
I don't think I've ever played a $60 game where a weapon has a bug that uses all of your ammo, and still has the bug 3 months after release.
---
Yea like The Division? No mans sky? Both had rocky starts.  Both had their best patches after a year. Both are decent games now. Ones even getting a sequel.
---
3 months in and we’re getting DLC (or the like) in March? I’m leaning towards you’re impatient and rushed to end game. 
---
But really though..Who cares? you’re gonna whine and bitch and then try posting an opinion like the company will read it and say... “omg he’s right let’s just do whatever this guy says. It will save our game” 
---
Yea okay. Feel free to play any other game. Bye Felicia 👋 
---
Btw I haven’t seen any influx in players before or after the current patch. Still see level 250s on the reg and still see level 1s joining. This sub is a minor percentage or people actually playing. 
---
Shit is always going to get rebalanced. In any game. I'm guessing you never played a brand new MMO, or one that introduces a new class?
---
Thanks! :)
---
You missed one part of that statement though :)
---
" If they're all indestructible terminals in one central location, it'll be fun, easy to use, and I can visit ALL of the player shops in 5 minutes without fast travelling. "
---
"One central location" is the key.  Not in people's camps or workshops.  Somewhere like Whitesprings, Top of The Worlds, or a new area they create specifically for the terminals (not in a build zone).
---
No. Not at all. It's not considered armor.
---
It's for hysterical raisins.
---
Don't play PvP unless your Melee.  It's just the path the developer has chosen.  It's probably something they will fix, given how many people are not playing at this point.
---
I've gone 3x. Only one was legendary though. Just so you know. 
---
In such a serious, sarcastic post, I couldn’t stop laughing at the phrase “fucks off”. I know it’s pretty common, but I read it in my head as if an Australian said it 😂
---
It's not even bugs and glitches, it's just simple game design issues. 
---
But if we are going to talk bugs and glitches, I dont' know, maybe they could have fixed some of the bugs and glitches that were known about in their own engine before releasing the game - even stupid simple ones like the rifle reloading issue.  
---
Or maybe some simple graphical ones that were identified on day one of BETA of the enemies holding weapons at weird angles. 
---
This awfull bug when you are 249/250 and can’t fast travel because too much weight!!! So boring...

Even if *most* of it isn't lighter, I personally use it for compulsive organization. 😅

i disagree on people expecting 3 star drop from 3 star legendary.  RNG is RNG.  3 star legendary should have HIGHER chance to drop better loot obviously but it shouldnt 100%.  what is strange is in FO4, legendary always dropped legendary (even if it was garbage).  i wish they brought that back here.
---
Might be. I've had danger status follow me for ever. With no mobs anywhere. I'm sure it's related.
---
The definition was never defined I think is the problem, some people believe hotfix means the server is "up" while others believe the server needs to be "live" and in production (the two aren't mutually exclusive). I have never considered a hotfix to mean there would be no downtime. I haven't met any software people in this company or my field who believe that. Certainly if they did they would at least understand "hotfix" may still mean downtime regardless of their personal definition.
---
This whole thread doesnt take PVP into account. 
---
Melee isnt OP in PvP.  Pve adjustments can be made without nerfing player dmg further. 
---
Balance was adjusted shortly before introducing a bunch of new PvP modes. So it makes sense. PvP feels alot more balanced now.  That was Bethesdas focus. 
---
Before any of you PvE players respond with  "MeLeE iS StILL oP iN PvP" . im going to just tell you. It isnt.
---
Player vs Player is going to drive balancing. Adjustments can be made to npc enemy healthpools and armor to give you guys the playstyle you were used to in pve prior to patch 5. 
---
Why isnt melee OP in PvP? Well, theres no gap closer. Melee players have to get close to ranged players which usually results in 1 to 5 FREE SHOTS on the melee player while he looks for or charges a ranged attacker. Ranged players can force melee to look for them. They have the luxury of hiding, sniping and ambushing from a range. 
---
If you disagree with me it's because you never PvP'd on a melee build. Frankly most of this sub has no idea what end game PvP feels like. 
---
I havr 3/6 pieces of 3 star armor and actively PvP. Im competitively in the upper tier of pvp &amp; prior to patch 5 i was severly disadvantaged even with my 3 star bloody sledge and 3 star cavaliers unyielding gear. 
---
I would get 1 shotted by casuals in excavator armor with a tse. All they needed was good positioning: on a cliff, roof, crows nest or open field. 
---
Patch 5 did a great job of balancing pvp. Exluding vats head shots it take 2 to 5 shots to take me down which is a fair exchange. 
---
Go try to take someones workshop with a melee build while they are at the bench. Stay in the green circle for 2 minutes while you can be shot at but cannot shoot back. Let me know how that works out for you, tOtALlY OP rIgHt GuYs????? 
---
Hell no. Just move on to something better.
---
I've noticed this for me as well. I've gone into 5 nuke zones and I havent had any hitching or crashes. It's nice! Now the pipboy bug upon loading in is still a problem. 
---
&gt; There were a lot of people out there,
---
There's your problem.
---
lol you got down voted because before your edit all it said was "first" not a good reason either. but it is reddit lol.
---
Don't worry I'm sure it'll get passed along
---
I'm mostly upset I unlocked the somerset special too early on my handgun build as it has 50% armour pen. So the gun is level 5 for me... Too much work to start over and avoid the main quest until lvl 50.
---
Well, I do have the metal signs, so currently there are a bunch of “women” signs. I want to add a male too, we cater to all now. And I wish there was a robot sign.
---
Certainly a reduction in nukes. 
---
What if I don't know about the shelter system or don't have the materials
---
Highlight and it says on the bottom left. Left stick on Xbox
---
On console you use modify in build mode and press left trigger.
---
I had my second night in a row of stable servers, even in nuke zones, on PS4.   It has been a vast improvement.  
---
careful, your going to be labeled a Bethesda dick rider... Common sense, level headedness, logic is a bad trait in this society.
---
I suppose some well meaning player could repost  that list on their official forums too.
---
Holy buckets. Any idea where exactly that was?
---
On ps4 you open build menu, then press circel then look at the water, then press l2 then select what type of lock you want. 
---
I didn't realize they disappeared when you logged out and I spent over 3 hours building a house and decorating and collecting resources. Needless to say, I wanted to cry when I realized it was all for nothing. I defended that place 4 times! 4! Here's a question, what happens to all the resources I spent building it, are they returned to me? Also items that I put in storage containers? Don't fucking tell me that they're gone forever
---
You’re talking about percentages. Of course they are aware of the platforms and the various variables for performance. The question shouldn’t be - “why isn’t everyone else experiencing what I’m experiencing?”the question should be why are the overwhelming majority of players experiencing poor performance?
---
It may boil down the same but you’re leading a false narrative to many with your wording. The reality is that Bethesda ruined this game. They’re salvaging whatever they can to make some money from the atom store before this game completely dies down
---
Smite hotfixes tend to have downtime aswell.
---
Ok, but what's your grievance about adopting this idea?
---
Getting the tea and no tea was the real trick.
---
Dave's not here man...
---
Concerning Events and timers - if you can't figure out what an appropriate timer is for an Event on the map (because, I agree, some Events have multiple timers), maybe it could say how long the Event has been available instead.  If it's been there for 10 minutes, and no one has done it, it might be risky to go there.
---
I suppose, conversely, maybe the problematic Events shouldn't have multiple timers.  Like, in Irrational Fears, there's the timer for talking to the Mr. Handy and the timer for defending him.  Why does the former need a timer?  Why can't he just sit there until some player comes through and activates the event?  I think AWOL Armament is like this too.
---
QUANTUM MOLOTOV PLZ.

Same was at 720 in my excavator PA yesterday 
---
I’m on pc and I think I’ve crashed maybe twice. I’ve never had any problems with bugs or stretchy dogs. Sometimes there’s bad lag but I have really crap internet so I’m not suprised
---
It's really funny how you can't defend the game, or yourself, and your best recourse is that you can't imagine uptime over a few hours/days.  For your sake I really hope you're a few months into a desk support job and you can quit and go back to school or something.
---
Aside from your idiocy about how load balancing is the key to preventing these kinds of crashes, the fact that you think the instance you're connected to is loading "voice files" LOL and other assets and sending them to your client makes it clear just how little you know about games, servers, design or networking.
---
Even sadder though is how hard you're sucking Beth's dick despite all the bullshit we've gone through since beta.
---
I invested in Bear Arms, Ordinance Express, and Demolitions Expert just to make a big boom build... I've used an Instigating MIRV to great success against swarms of bloated glowing ones in Whitespring. With one volley netting 2k to 4k XP, it was listers a blast. But, those days are gone...
---
I mean different ammo types sure but, that might cause issues with balancing more than they have already 
---
I bet they have special code tied to the specific item name. Like they hard coded the "it's an item that contains other items" to the specific item title instead of to an index or something 
---
Agreed 
---
Til they sink with the ship and their tombstones read RIP fanboy
---
Don't know what platform your on but I'm Xbox and when on the c.a.m.p I press A to move item X to scrap and LT to lock. Whatever your playing on it says at the bottom of the screen when you highlight it.

You are most welcome 
---
this issue *is* low urgency tho
---
You cant blast the starting zone.  These are non issues.

There are 2 build modes

Craft / Place

Edit
---
I think it's on edit but I'm not 100% sure.  Look at the purifier and then see the controls at the bottom of the screen.  One should say Press F to Lock (or a controller button).  Press that, and you'll select a level 1, 2, 3 lock.
---
With that being said, I have 3 small purifiers and I leave them unlocked 24/7.  They generate enough water that if someone thirsty comes by, they can use them, and by the time I get home again they'll be full.
---
I also leave a stash outside my base so they can use that as well.  Never had a problem with people blowing up my base.  It could be the water and the stash, or the fact that it's a 2x2 cube with 4 rocket turrets on special extended wings off the roof.
---
Open Build Mode and press the button for Edit. Approach your Water Purifier, and you should be given an option to Lock (on PC this is the F key). It will then let you select the level of your lock, assuming you have the resources.
---
I've had a great experience so far but I am mostly a casual player. I try to get in an hour most weekdays and usually can play a few more than that over the weekends. I'm only at level 42 and have played since BETA (PC) but I haven't hit the nuke zones more than one or twice and have just been exploring, crafting, trying new camp builds, and looking for materials. I do get occasional disconnects but so far they haven't been excessive and the crashes have been infrequent with the exception that for a while every time I exited to the desktop it would hang. 
---
I am a little concerned that there may be issues with Stealth currently as I play a sneaky sniper build but other than it showing CAUTION when no enemies are around and still letting me fast travel anyway I haven't experienced what others are describing (yet).
---
well if this big ass list isn't making it to the dev's through reddit someone should repost it on the official forums (it could use more traffic anyway)
---
Phew lol I thought there would be a crowd of people telling them but since there isnt I needed to tell them lol. 
---
But in all honesty I just was making a troll Bethesda post
---
that seems cool and better gameplay than the real gameplay. why ISN'T there content like that? 
---
Thanks for asking this question.  A lot of the casual players have no idea what it means.
---
Id be all over anti scorched missles. I only carry the missle launcher on my melee as an AA weapon. Thats its only purpose. 
---
I never go on the official forums, but I've seen it enough here that I can only believe it is on there as well. 
---
Stimpacks outheal mist rifle builds atm. Use cover 1 shot the dude. Simple playstyle for the easy mode of fallout, no need to worry about ammo, tons of the best perks. 
---
You’re a gem. Funeral home checks out, by fairgrounds do you mean Tyler County?
---
True i did make sure to post the moment i got pinged for it. 
---
Just an aside, a lot of folks are probably in the same boat as I am with regards to perks - I just hit 72 and look at my perks and still feel like I got at least 20 more levels before it's where I want it to be. I didn't really look at anything before the game came out and got a whole bunch of cards at the start that are totally useless to my character lol.  
---
Not sure how many hours exactly, but I'm close to somewhere around 150 (I took a week off to play when it first came out and really only like to play when I can commit at least a few hours).  
---
This is a big issue, a lot of players build there first camps at whitespring. You can't just make whitespring not nukeable
---
That's a frikking reasoning!
---
I've had a bug with the Excavator armour for ages, even before the patch, not sure if normal
---
When I get into the game I'll have 450ish (forget exactly) carry cap (when I load in, I will be inside the PA)
---
If I get out of the PA to do something, then go back in, my carry weight will then have a max of 350ish
---
Not sure I understand what is happening here, but I am thinking the original cap of 450 is bugged (and is too high?)
---
I've never had that issue. I'll grab a bounty if it's close, but I won't travel across the map hunting a 10 Cap bounty.

Im having issues with perishable items in my inventory or food. When ever I sleep of fast travel or when I log in to a server i seem to lose all my perishables. It might be due to how time scaling works but ive had stacks of 100 glowing meat steaks and it all disapears sometimes. Ive also noticed water going down in such a fast rate. Im drinking purified water and i have 10 purifiers and thats what it needed to supply me witu no surplus
---
I reloaded 3 times in a row last night and got 3 different max carry weights- wtf?
---
Edit: meant to say for melee weapons.
---
Or does it only apply for normal weapons?
---
Ow I know. I just think they should have another look at her. Cause the event is fun but the rewards are bad.
---
Bobbleheads and magazines.

Power Armor that remains docked in a Power Armor Station.
---
Another decor factoid for ya. When I came across Helvetia in-game, I was confused because the unique/colorful decor looked super similar to a style commonly associated Amish country in Pennsylvania. It's because both Helvetia and the Amish share a Germanic heritage and presumably that's where that style comes from.
---
I hope you're using super duper. It works for crafting weapons and thrown weapons as well.
---
TL;DR  
---
You failed reality check. Maybe you are stupid, maybe you are paid pawn, maybe you just like very different things in life. Honestly I do not care. But defending this behaviour and game is toxic for other gamers. It just promotes bad practices and will hurt even you in long run.  
---
\-Long version:  
---
"The fact is, the 171,000 people on this subreddit"  
---
Bethesda said in Dec 2018 that "millions are playing". I highly doubt that, because that would mean they need more then 50 thousands of servers up and running to serve more then million players (I estimate that about 1/3 of the player base could be playing at one time given different timezones).   
---
Even if that is the case, number of people here would represent \~10%. That is quite a lot.  
---
"when less half of every player is even halfway through the main quest is going to fall on deaf ears."  
---
Link to statistic please. Otherwise it is anecdotal evidence and everyone make such claims ;-)  
---
"the game is still a baby."  
---
So much fail in this statement. First of all, the engine and a lot of assets are strictly copied from Fallout 4. It feels like a DLC with huge map, maybe a datadisc from old times, not a new born game(baby). Also from the B.E.T.A people were giving feedback and often (because the game is basically FO4 and people know how it works underneath) were giving exact solutions. You can find such threads here. There is no excuse for the state of the game. Ofc some things, like re-balancing of some mods or weapons can happen, but again BSG did awful job. They have major problem with energy weapons being useless, thanks to sub-par damage and terrible durability mechanic, so the majority of people use one or two weapon builds and the brilliant (sarcasm) solution from BSG is to nerf those. This is just example how bad FO76 is being run and there is no excuse for it.  
---
"Most importantly, closing the gap between normal and "elite" ensures casual players stay engaged."  
---
There might be not a gap between normal players that are at the endgame and elite players min-maxing everything, but that is because BSG took fun from it. It is like crippling speed cars, because you do not like people not buying shitty hybrids. Also the crappy level-respawn system is making a lot of players struggle during questing (a wild 68 elite appears and ruins your day in area where you would expect 12lvl monsters) and leveling which is actually making a bigger gab between those 120+lvl players who steamroll through everything and 60lvl players that should already tackle endgame, but they cannot use tools. And the combat mechanics in FO4 and FO76 is crap, so it almost eliminates skill. SQ is basically a gear-check.  
---
"Every fix in this patch is a fix that benefits the causal, average player."  
---
NOPE, not by a long shot, because there are lot of fixes that introduced another problems and a lot of them are to the quality of life. Casuals are crippled. Elites know a way around. They use different combo, because they are lvl 200, have hoards of caps, do not need to farm, because they already have all the combinations of legendary effects, plans, etc.  
---
"But, I will still say that Bethesda took huge steps towards stabilizing the game in this patch."  
---
All changes they did was to limit options for players. Like the weight limit. Such changes will possibly reduce the stress some players create on application backend, which could lead to more stable servers. But they did not fix the core problems. And if they provide players with what they ask for, namely bigger stash, more content, etc. they will run into the same wall again - they will be stuck between rock and hard place. All they do is to provide workarounds. And sometime they even revert the fixes, because they are so bad at their job, they do not have the slightest idea how any software is developed and deployed.  
---
"FO76 is in no way behind schedule for content update compared to the previous game."  
---
Do you realize, that in FO76 you will reach endgame in about 20hours, around 30ish level? There are very few events you can do, most of them feels the same. By level 30 you should already have PA from quest, which means you can do SQ encounter and you would have probably already ventured there (I am basing this on fact that there is no direct system, like level zones, etc. and nuke events are broadcasted on whole server - you get the quest, many will be interested what happens there). Fallout 4 supported mods, had several different endgame quests, HAD actual quests NPCs, etc. all this meant there IS content to explore for several dozens of hours. Fallout 76 on the other hand is sooo bare and boring. And plagued by major issues, like the fact that most of weapons are useless, therefore a lot of perks are useless, therefore there is not much to explore in terms of game system. You can explore bigger map, but the problem is that the map is not that interesting, and again, no NPC, repetitive enemies, stupid AI. Almost no reason to have ALT, no faction decisions, nothing.
---
I'm currently doing that with my current build.
---
Got to level 41 at the moment, can't wait to hit 45 and get the top level version, i'm hoping the 50% armour penetration will make it a decent weapon (My build is heavily focused on VAT's Crits)
---
Same, water is ridiculous now... luckily my cannibal keeps hunger in check but I'm at the point where I stay in Whitespring for the free fountain, not the blast zone.
---
90% weight reduction backups? That’s pretty clever!
---
And I’d seriously pay you for that junkie’s Gatling. 
---
I’ll counter and upvote if we can use legendary Bobby pins as ammo!
---
I'm buying those atoms as fast as I can man.
---
yeah, there is a metal shed near the south west that has a halloween party set up. I can't remember if it has chewing gum, but it might.
---
It's called the Glade. Or Cranberry glade. It's to the right of watoga. 
---
I got 3 heavy combat armor plans (chest, legs, arms) from the Watoga vendor last night in about 6 server hops.
---
I suppose I’m casual. I got lucky once and helped kill SBQ at level 30. I am well aware my contribution to that fight was entirely in ads removal. I’m fine with that. It was still awesome.
---
I’ve put in maybe 200 hours. Just broke level 70. Working on the Enclave questline and Brotherhood lines right now. Pretty sure everything else is complete. Have done minimal CAMP crafting until I could tell what plans I already had (big thanks to the patch for that).
---
I have no legendary weapons other than an Instigating Dragon. My armor is all 2 star legendary. Not once have I seen a TSE or E weapon. The nerf to those is wonderful to me. 
---
You know how many times I trained my sights on a baddy only to see it instantly explode because some TSE level 130 dude pulled the trigger once before I could? I mean, it’s cool that he’s one shoting stuff that takes me three hits, but damn dude...share the XP bro! You obviously don’t need any more, so slow your roll and let me level. Literally had someone follow me around for half an hour killing everything before I could land a hit. Can’t tell if they thought they were helping or griefing me, but it felt like the latter. It’s not fun to get zero XP, folks.
---
Anyway. Call me casual if you want. I paid the same amount for the game you did. Only I didn’t run as fast as I could trough it all and get bored when there wasn’t anything new. So if they nerf your stuff to help me have fun, awesome. I’m singing praises over here.
---
[takes deep breath]
---
Ok. Bring on the downvotes.
---
LOL! Wow you're kidding right?  A combat shotgun with zero legendary effects does over 200 damage with the proper perks/ mods. 
---
Amazing.  I'm definitely going to use some of your tips.
---
From experience, beer bottles don't have enough volume to make effective molotovs.

Bare minimum is a 750ml bottle. 1.5l is better, but not everyone is such an alcoholic.

Oh snap that’s undiscovered for me! 
---
FIELD TRIP!
---
Aptly put. :-) I knew that comment would get down-voted into oblivion, but didn't care. If I'm a triple-A game company I'm not reading "We the people..." comments. I'm far more like to comb over the ones that itemized what a player is frustrated with, and how it could be different/better. When it comes to influencing external change, specifics &gt; mob/sob posturing every time.
---
I've been in two.  I wasn't prepared for either.
---
The problem is the dev team really doesn't understand "balance".  League of Legends does a lot of balance patches, and for the most part they're pretty good at balancing all of the champions / play styles.
---

Tie decorations in to challenges concerning dailies.

Twice this had happened to me where I scrapped everything and it still showed a good percentage of my budget was in use. The solution was to completely scrap EVERYTHING, then move my camp and the budget went back to 0 again. It really sucked to lose all of the materials but it was worth it to get my budget back. 
---
Unfortunately the wiki makes no citation for that definition, it is literally just the definition of whoever wrote it. Incidentally several of the citations for other parts of the wiki article actually contradict the definition.
---
Some problem here.  It's like enemies got a double perception buff, and sometimes I just go into \[danger\] with no enemies in sight.  It wouldn't be a problem, expect that I lose all my SA multipliers and have to slap them until they die.
---
Pacifist mode only affects your damage output. Other toons can still hurt you 
---
Weird. I survived a nuke within one. Without any power armor.
---
The enclave even has missions that make use of them for their carpet bombing protocol.
---
Eh moreso people who cant be bothered and just want to enjoy playing the game.

Theres a melee sneak card dude, covert ops is for guns

 takes advantage of the fools, if they want more money, they must first fix the game

Keep ES6 single player please. No more survival games.
---
&gt; My QE (quad explosive) radium got nerfed and it only does 63 damage now. 
---
How many points in rifleman did you invest in? Are you one of those people who only put one point in each level? (Rifleman, Expert, and Master?).
---
Taking this long to even balance this game or even having to do so to this extent is a joke in itself though. It’s laughable that you can even consider a $60 game made by a large and reputable group to ever have a “baby” stage after release. It shows how much this game has failed and has continued to do so. That it’s almost unplayable still this far along and the content is EXTREMELY lacking. The content in the game is not defendable. It takes very little time and effort  to reach 50 honestly and the main reason it’s a small number is because so many people have quit on this game. So the people who gave a shit have nothing left to do. 
---
My husband and I enjoy playing too, but we don't have time for a bullshit ban. I don't know why it's so hard for you to accept that bad shit happens and sometimes it's uncalled for. 
---
I like how the status to the known issues is that they're aware of these issues. 
---
Is there a slow hand clap bot one can summon on reddit?
---
I am pretty sure they couldn't. They would need to make sure everyone is off the servers so they could implement it without different players on different versions of the patch.
---
Also make sure you have the Power Armor Mod perk on.  I forget what it's named.  It's the Power Armor equivalent to Armorer.
---
ITS THE GOD DAMN NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE, IN HARDCORE MODE 
---
Can you hear me yet?  Do I need to turn this up for you?
---
The mod that multiplied the explosion was scary.  You had to be really careful when you shot one, and had to run like a madman when you heard a suicider.
---
When the miscellaneous mission comes up for Gauley Mine to collect coal, the mission displayed actually says “Plan for Play Power Armor” or something like that. 
---
&gt; and have brought this up for discussion in meetings.
---
LOL, well im sure thats put a lot of players at ease. Its only the end boss we're talking about. No big deal eh.
---
Sounds like you might have exploded a car next to them or something. What exactly did they "do" that you're leaving out the middle of your story?
---
what is the fast travel trick?
---
You monsters, TSES ARE ALL THEY KNOW :(
---
I try to make a nice, character appropriate, camps. It infuriates me when I find an ideal spot then log in only to see instead of my camp a wooden box with a locked door or a stairway to a floating platform.
---
It does not bother me if I see a camp with some effort put in to it. Have some pride people. If you aren't going to build a decent camp just use the overseer's camp or Whitesprings.
---
Well on the plus side, I haven't got mad. Spent a lot of last night searching for enemies I just killed. It's good to know that it's just another Bethesda balls up, and I don't have to increase my brain meds :)
---
Seriously. Missile launchers and fatmans don't need to be nerfed. They're so heavy I only ever use one in any fallout game when I have to and it's a real sacrifice to bring one and its heavy ammo with me. They are absolutely pointless if they are so heavy and barely do much more damage.
---
Saw somewhere online in the last week that for whatever reason the Martial Artist Perk card affects the fire rate positively by speeding up the cranking animation. Haven't had a chance to try this yet myself, but plan on it. I've loved my Stalker's Explosive GG ever since it dropped. Sadly, I noticed last night that currently post patch I've only got it at ~120 dmg at the moment though. Need to do some work on that.
---
Yes please :)
---
We should be able to LOCK our items in our pip boy so they can't be scrapped, dropped, traded, or sold.
---
Then any legendary items we have UNLOCKED should be able to be SCRAPPED for a 5% chance to pull one legendary modifier off the weapon.  That legendary mod would act just like a weapon / armor mod (a one time use to attach to any weapon / armor).
---
People can now farm and grind to their ideal build.  Bonus is it makes mass duped weapons LESS valuable.  Why go for a duped weapon everyone has, when you can effectively grind your perfect weapon for your build instead?
---
Aisha Tyler? "WOW! That Elder Scrolls trailer gave me Girl wood!"
---
Even in Fallout 3 they were useless. Nothing's improved but now each missile weighs two pounds.
---
I don’t think it’s a level thing. Since the newest patch you can plans for gear and guns above your level.
---
Metal building plans, it’s a steal @ $2500 (sarcasm) lolz
---
Same for .50 BMG PLANS.  You can buy and learn you just can’t use till you’re tall enough.
---
damn im stupid. gonna delete this thread then
---
Lore wise we are nuking because the scorched plague wiped out all life much worse than the nuclear apocalypse did, we are doing Appalachia a favor

Wow.  I thought the one I saw was bad.

---
Which perk cards are they? I may have missed one !
---
I using 3 tiers of Rifleman...besides no sneak or Vats build. 
---
I shouldn’t have to run vats or Sneak build to get Damage.
---
Haha, you should keep it. It’s pretty nice. If you ever feel like seeing what addictions do to it, well...lol is all I’ll say about that.
---
Every time I log in on Xbox I experience a bug in about 5 minutes.
---
Whahahaha!! We'll said!!! 
---
Even if you only got back lead and steel. Because in real life when you get some ammo and it’s not factory ammo and you didn’t load it yourself you shouldn’t fire it. You don’t know what powder is in it or how much so you’d pull the bullets, dump the powder, and reuse the brass and bullets. 
---
I know I'm going to get downvoted for this, but the truth is there are no problems, we're just pretending there are to keep you away.
---
Melee is so strong and VATs teleports and hits 100% of the time so there is no need for pistols in the game.
---
There is another house in Flatwoods that usually has bubblegum.  It's at the top and has a crate on the porch.  The bubblegum is usually on the table between the sets of chairs.
---
If you are thinking that right now 170k is a small percentage of the player base you should stop smoking weed. The majority of players have already quitted. In Europe this game is at 80% discount which represents lack of demand. 
---
Get out of here, Todd!
---
I just don't see the nerf to damage. I have no problem taking out, up to level 95 which is highest I've seen so far, enemies.
---
I have PA heavy weapon build.
---
But using heavy full auto weapons (. 50 cal or Gatling gun), melee, full auto handmades, full auto Combat rifles or shotguns. I have no problems in taking out enemies. I might have to use a stimpak, but I get so many from event's that I sell all over 100 pcs.
---
If you have problem killing enemies after leveling to 50, then the problem is in your game play and perk setup, not in the game. 
---
I don’t think you’ll get banned if it’s a bug you didn’t initiate.
---
Besides you’re only talking, 2 items. Not 200 or 2000
---
Do it then. Maybe then i won’t have to listen to your constant bitching.
---
*Laughs hysterically* in **Cincinnati**
---
That's addressed in the very first paragraph., ffs.
---
Since they made enemies bullet spongie like they are and gave regular weapons literally no damage, people needed their TSE weapons 
---
I had to fight an invisible one once. I ran and ran and ran
---
Lol seems that way
---
The railway rifle has been my favorite weapon since the first time I crafted it in Fallout 3.  
---
I'm super mad that it doesn't take Rifleman perks.  
---
IT'S GOT RIFLE IN THE NAME
---
The armour repair cost is unfortunately not a bug but a feature :-/ 
---
Why it would cost more to repair a piece of armour that to build a new one (assuming you have the plan for it) is pretty incomprehensible to me. 
---
I haven't had a chance to play since the hotfix, but I have noticed that vendor inventories can take a long time to load. I haven't experienced any of them not actually loading their inventory at all, not yet at least, but that sounds like it sucks. 
---
About the hit chance: I suspect it has more to do with hit detection registering on the server, i.e. a lag issue, than with a broken hit chance script. It seems to happen more often to me when I'm already seeing other signs of lag, like rubberbanding. In any case it's really annoying. 
---
And yes, some days it feels a bit like "Loading Screen: the Game". 
---
No ps4 sucks.
---
The nukes are supposed to be used to seal the fissures and eliminate the Scorchbeasts from the world.
---
Now if you give people the ability to launch nukes even tho there is a good target and reason for them to be used you can be assured someone will use them badly.
---
War, war never changes.
---
Hmm...
---
Honestly that's hard to say.
---
Off the top of my head, my main files for Fallout 3 were about ~400 and ~500 hours, respectively, while the last time I booted up my save for Fallout 4, it was at something like 37 Days of playtime. 
---
And that doesn't take into account the playthroughs I did for YouTube stuff, which were 101 20-30 minute episodes each of Fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas, and 248 20-30 minute episodes of Fallout 4.
---
Fallout Shelter is a crap shoot, since I manually adjusted my console time so I wouldn't be spending years on that game. And I justify that because I already have a real game that I did legit on my phone that I couldn't transfer. And I'm not sure how to check the time on that game.
---
Aaaaaand Fallout 76 is *just* cresting at 300 hours. Plus a dinky quick couple hour save I had to make to get trophies that didn't unlock because of the Beta.
---
Spawn bug happens all the time though. I've seen every flavor of enemy appear at random and then disappear to include scorch beast. I've seen them flying through the sky and then randomly disappear out of thin air. 
---
The god rays in the mountains, yes probably in the northwestern part of the map. Something they still need to fix regardless of what it's caused by. The lighting in the game is terrible in my opinion. 
---
If you have reactive plates or any of the mutations that damage attackers these will still go off even in pacifist mode and count as an attack.
---
I made a post about how they should do balance here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/?sort=new)
---
Did TSE need a nerf, yes.
---
Did TSE need a triple nuke nerf into the dirt (two shot, explosive, and a perk card), no.
---
Small balance changes to ALL the builds are the way to do it :)
---
It doesn't.  
---
Equip and unequip the Rifleman perk cards.  Pay attention to how the damage changes on items like the Hunting rifle and Lever-Action rifle, but not the Railway rifle.
---
Of course not? But the fact its a flaming hot trainwreck of a mess that sold terribly and has completely tanked Bethesda's reputation does make it worthless. 
---
&gt;you guys play too much so the game breaking patches are okay
---
Fucking lol
---
There is no clipping issue with it, there’s no difference between the Gas Mask, Gas Mask with Goggles and the Urban/Forest Operative Masks and the way they interact with headgear, it’s simply just that Bethesda never thought to add the capability to do so, probably just never thought of it.
---
It would be neat to see it implemented, but it isn’t a necessity, and about someone mentioning
---
I share that feeling, more so at work.  I work in an application support group and I cannot tell you how many times a problem has become visible in my application (integration software) that was caused by someone making a 'simple change' elsewhere and not publishing the details to the broader group before hand for review, then being adamant that the problem is within my application because what they did could not have the effect it did and they won't bother to run a simple check until I provide them with direct evidence of their error.   Then for complex changes they are careful to share what they intend to do and it gets reviewed and issues get sorted out before they become problems because they know their could be unforeseen consequences.  Simplicity and overconfidence are a dangerous combination.
---
Radicool.  I do have this perk as well.
---
By the way everyone if you server hop for Ballistic Fiber, or anything really, then it's considered an exploit. And they take exploits very seriously. Like the caps stash one. Now caps stash has been nerfed, sometimes it doesn't have the "search" option. They also stay empty for days after looting them, like many containers. Power Armor pieces are unequipping themselves. Somebody said scrap the old chassis and get a new one. I'll try that but I don't know if it'll work.
---
Uh....whats your point? 
---
I stowed all my launchers and grenades until base damage is brought back up. I threw a grenade at a group of scorched last night and they just stood there laughing.  #NoBully
---
The 10mm pistol does need a buff.
---
Te other pistols could use a buff as well.
---
You know, I think addictions might be broken for me. I've never gotten one - or maybe I have?  I sometimes see the zonked out guy walking animation when I take a rad x diluted, but I've never seen anything in the status page about being addicted.  I've got marsupial, speed demon, eagle eyes, bird bones and grounded, but I don't think they affect chem use.
---
I'm on Xbox, played at least 6 hours on at least 6 different severs and have had no issues.  
---
It is a bit odd if you think about it lol. An option would be a nice addition. After you complete the silo run and enter the nuke code, maybe give an option to lock the silo down. It could prevent a launch for an amount of time and give the player a unique set of rewards. A similar decision to side with or destroying the institute.
---
Haha, thank you, and thank you for your reply. I'll tell my friend I remember him creating a mule on his account...don't know if he'd want to play after hearing this, and if he doesn't play, I'll hold off a bit longer too.
---
“Waaaaaah it’s not singleplayer i hate playing with other people reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
---
Unequip and then reequip either strange in numbers or class freak or both
---
Sure. My bad. I guess Bethesda must now be like "hey guys, stop whatever you're doing! This guy is a big fan of Oblivion so let's do whatever he's asking!"
---
Xbox, but evidently there are sign in issues lol
---
There's a bunch at Whitesprings.  Check the homes around it and the golf club.
---
There are a lot of fun ideas in here--thank you for posting them.

Fyi, Flatwoods Monster = Alien, Alien=Flatwoods Monster .

There is no citation for the wiki definition, it was just the definition of whoever wrote it.

I'm going to time it now on both systems. I suspect the time is, like another reply says, high as a week for some container types, but I'm not certain. I'm going to farm my usual spots every day and see if I can figure out what it is at now for sure. Before, it was definitely no more than 24 from what I saw with my routine, might have been 20, but it has changed. Although I mentioned it wasn't a big deal, it actually does discourage me from daily play now a bit.
---
 "The best places to relay your feedback is on our official forums." Until you ban them over there...
---
Are you looking for something like an AMA or something else? 
---
Instead of going to that hassle you can just as easily find a trader willing to sell you a pistol with the anti-armor legendary. It has the exact same effect.
---
An anti-armor western revolver with a scope and hardened receiver would be superior in every way.
---
Probably. My guess is that it's some kind of lag issue that prevents the Danger or Caution flags from resetting properly, but then again I'm no developer... 
---
One of the old exploits for duping has been unpatched, which is why some are experiencing extreme server lag again.
---
The biggest issue for me is getting Rad worms and it buffing/nerfing random stats and perks, and messing with mutations. Than after the disease goes away all your attributes change again.
---
Cap collecting and collector are also kinda buggy, not all stashes are respawning on a server, you cant use the perk to search all cap containers, and people not using the perk are often finding 1 or no caps in containers.
---
Patch 5 didnt break the game, but it was a bit of step back in some regards, and opened the eyes of some to how little QA is being done on the patches.
---
yep, I dont expect more content already.  It's only been a couple months.
---
But I don't expect them to keep adding to the grind instead.   It will definitely make people take longer to get to the end game content.   That may be good or bad, we'll see.
---
While I did notice things were a bit wonky last night, it did seem like stealth was working sometimes.  For instance I had a scorched walk up right next to me and walk past me without seeing me.  The biggest issue I have with with the inconsistency of the perk escape artist.  Sometimes I can crouch and go directly from danger to caution.  Other times it doesn't work at all no matter how many times I stand then crouch.
---
Example:  Yesterday I was at NRA, I stealthed and killed all the scorched that were attacking the Gulpers that had spawned.  The gulpers then saw me so I hoped up on the roof so I could kill them where they couldn't get to me.  However I couldn't get back into caution no matter what I did.  So I said screw it, one of my teammates was heading in the direction and instead of wasting non-sneak bullets I would just wait up there.  So instead I went into my pipboy and leveled up.  Then exited pipboy and now I was fully stealthed (not even cautioned anymore just hidden).  All the gulpers were still around the building so then I proceeded to stealth kill them one by one, NEVER even getting into caution just hidden the whole time (friend showed up and I was like ops they all died mysteriously... :-p).  
---
Based on the above there certainly SEEMS like there is some sort of server sync issue happening in regard to stealth.
---
I do think that the Escape Artist perk should get a second look by the developers.  If it only works 50% of the time and the other 50% I have to go just stand someplace and wait for Danger/Caution/Hidden to just progress naturally (ie wait for the brackets to slowly move apart until they got o the next level) then the perk really isn't worth the point investment.
---
I moved my camp the other day and it duplicated everything, it sucked taking the time to delete all the copies just so I could place my building again
---
Iirc my tesla rifle came from a treasure map dig.
---
Maybe it's even worse with all the explosions of those missile turrets.
---
Gonna upvote this seeing as I’m a stealth sniper as well
---
No 
---
Nuke all day every day 
---
Probably unyielding. It's a decent dmg boost for melee. Suicidal though.
---
Errrr what am I missing? My two shot handmade does like 136 with the 3*10% rifleman cards and bloody mess.
---
What other perks/mutations and stuff might you have active?
---
no, i'm ok with it.  I had 47 perk points saved so no biggie.
---
  This will also have to be adjusted based on weapon rate of fire.  If a griefer tries switching to a minigun, laser or plasma gatlin, the percentage should drop even lower so they have to burn through about 100 fusion or plasma cores just to kill one player or one component of a camp.

I think you are saying they don't care because they aren't doing everything that Redditors want.  Reddit isn't the only place where Bethesda gets feedback. 
---
Their website has a place where you can file a report ticket to  report problems. 
---
I had a big problem with the balancing of TSE weapons, and I filed several reports through their website. 
---
The people who complain about such issues as the TSE go to their website  because it's private, and they don't have worry about getting trolled and down voted to hell like they do here. 
---
Bottom line: they care what people think, but people on Reddit aren't the only people they are listening to.
---
Easy. Think the most ive had was like 28 or 32 or something. 15 is the S.P.E.C.I.A.L soft cap. You can push it higher with armor. Weapons. Mutations and team skills very easily.
---
I mean, is it? This is **the** end game content, and it barely even functions. The bugs that riddle the SBQ are numerous in a game with very little content to start with.
---
It is getting a little hostile here, huh?
---
Before hotfix but after patch it wouldn't auto unbulk for crafting regardless of where the bulk was located (personal inventory or stash).  Player had to manually scrap a bulk item to craft.
---
Before patch it would auto unbulk but a Scrap All wouldn't unbulk anything (which was a good thing).
---
Neat, I'll add to this when I get home. (placemaker/reminder)
---
agreed
---
Someone posted XBL and PSN Achievement stats.  Looking for the link now.
---
.... how is what he said an "attack"?
---
Me and my boys had an enclosed village where I might not be on a day or two and I’d come back to something awesome that one of my boys had built. That was awesome.
---
Oh! Do you love the O’s too?
---
What about just the buzz blade and shishkebab?
---
For what it’s worth I had a workshop all set up and chugging away, someone had nuked Whitesprings, I was collecting flux... BAM Blue Screen of Death on PS4.     Fuck this game. It happens all the fucking time. It’s my day off for fuck’s sake.
---
If you want your armor modded, go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.
---
There are dedicated player stores that do that for a caps cost.  Sometimes free if you provide mats.
---
Of the two, focus on FO76 Market reddit first.  They have a Karma system so you can see how many legit trades a player has done.
---
I haven't been ganked once on either reddit.  If you do get ganked you can request that the mods ban the person and they'll lose their karma.
---
If you people didn’t keep duping your TSE weapons we wouldn’t have this problem.
---
Blame this on the misfortune of your birth.

---
Come on, son, how could you miss this opportunity?
---
Is there any way for developers to pair up/schedule time with folks having these problems to observe the issue?  Might be helpful if it isn't easily recreated locally in your test environments.
---
I'm only ever  really playing any video game because my partner in crime is playing , we both enjoy exploration and post apocalyptic settings so getting to be able to play a game together is a no brainer for us . the game is definitely buggy but I might just be luckier than most as a lot of the bugs others have encountered i either really havent encountered or havent really impacted my play . ( I'm sure these bugs exist and unduly impact others but I just keep trudging along )
---
I'm currently level 132 and log in for a bit almost every night but I've likely done less than 10 SBQ fights ...I still run from scorchbeasts sometimes . 
---
I dont really watch youtubers for opinion pieces on the state of the game but I'll sometimes look up specific info on a build or mission so I likely miss a lot of the drama , I do read the forums but I tend to skip over posts that have angry clickbait titles or the first sentence is just angry expletives and zero in on posts that seem intresting to me .
---
hmmm as far as the marketing mishaps there wasnt anything I really wanted at the price they were selling them ( the helmet was cool  but by waiting I have made out like a bandit on Amazon returns as well as over stocks. )
---
After learning the auto receiver mod I switched to commando (80 round clip with Quad). I decided 1 of each commando card so I could devote perks to VATS. I don't feel like the +5% is worth it. If I devote 6 more slots of perception at best I can get it to 78. That's with Demolition Expert at level 5 which brings the gun from 58 to 63 (huge waste of 5 perk slots).
---
Huh. WoW was 80-90% PVE players at any given point, going by armory stats. And it is one of the longest running and biggest open world  game, and has a far better PVP system than FO76.
---
The problem is that they still spawn from nuked fissures. If it actually sealed the fissure in the server or getting a lobby to nuke each fissure site to eliminate all beasts from spawning completely for a period of time would be a nice touch and stay in line with their lore, but nukes really exist for sbq raids for loot.
---
Thanks! the more traction it gets the higher the priority of the fix I would hope.
---
Almost always some on a counter on the first floor of camp mcclintock.  
---
I have a level 50 silenced mutant killer 10mm that I use in the lower level sections of the map.  It’s great on enemies up to level 25.  After that, I switch out to rifles or the shotgun to reduce bullet usage. 
---
I love it because it’s so silent in comparison to the other weapons.   It’s actually quite zen like.  Like you, I wish that there were better perks, or at least better scaling.   
---
For example, if Covert Operative was doubled for silenced pistols, then that would bring the 10mm closer to rifles and it would the be my go-to choice, even without anti-armor perks, for silent attacks.  
---
I teamed up with a guy last night.  We were doing the same quest.   We ended up in a lower level section so I pulled out my silenced 10mm.   I shot one of the scorched and it goes flying across the room and all of a sudden I hear 
---
Him:   whaaaaaat, wait...  what did you do?
---
Me:    shot him...
---
Him:  with what?
---
Me:    silenced 10mm...  why?
---
Him:   Laughing....   it looked like you gut punched him across the room...
---
PVP servers were removed. There is even less people doing pvp now and its only to get PVE items and then stop doing it.
---
Love the fusion core m79 idea. I could finally get rid of all the FCs I have.
---
Check your list for rare plans or expensive plans that will have future trade value when Player Vending comes out.
---
Then GIVE all the rest to a noobie.  I try to aim for those players level 30 and below.
---
They'll be super happy, and you get to feel good about it, everyone wins :)

What type of xbox do you have?

An excellent comprehensive post, definitely a keeper. +1
---
Rad worms are buggy now, multiplying all player effects by 1.5 including positive and negative effects 
---
I mean yeah I can’t play now if that’s the case...
---
There's a difference between platforms, though. Although there are many out-of-band mechanisms for PC users to communicate, such as reddit or the text chat mod, by definition those aren't really things that casual players are going to be aware of or make use of. So on the PC side, buying a weapon from another player is entirely a matter of randomly running into them in game and using voice chat.
---
Makes complete sense that a rad rat can bite through the heavy armor plating of power armor pieces to give you a disease
---
Glass junk got the short end of the stick honestly.
---
I was actually a little disappointed all the generic glass vessels like jars don''t have a purpose for collecting water without radiating yourself for example.
---
I got one within the first day of playing, was walking around flatwood and everything turned green.  Since, I have seen in 5 times.  I have been playing for a couple months now.
---
At first I was afraid, trying to find shelter, closing my doors, etc.  Now I'm just annoyed by them because it means I'll have to find/use a radaway once it's over.  And the green makes things hard to see sometimes.
---
My teammates who have been playing just as long as me, have never seen them.
---
If you are on PC for one gold and 3 cloth I can craft you a confederate uniform.
---
Crazy this thread got so many upvotes. Not sure why it annoys me so much but probably because OP likely doesn't even work in the field while trying to sound "I'm smarter than Bethesda" about it.
---
For event “Timers”, perhaps a red/yellow/green light system would work. 
---
For example, if the event has just begun or the thing you need to defend has high health, the event marker should be green. When the timer or health have reached the halfway point (or maybe 2/3rds) switch it to yellow. If event failure is imminent switch it to a red marker. 
---
It wouldn’t be a perfect system, but would at least give players a general idea what they’re getting into. 
---
Additionally, fast travel to events should have a flat, small cost—like 10 caps—or even be free. Paying 40+ caps to jump across the map has to be turning people off from joining. The world is simply too large to walk before time runs out. 
---
....its crashed.....so you had go reinstall the game....?
---
I’m pretty sure I’ve seen the Arty plans for sale on my vendor circuits before I completed BOS, which was just a few days ago.  But, this was before the patches. 
---
Yessir
---
Just hit level 10 and i'm loving it! yet to encounter a single bug, and the combat, loot and CAMP system are all awesome!
---
Thanks that did the trick 
---
Why are Explosive Bobbleheads the only item you’re preventing from being stackable? No self-applied buff should be stackable; that’s universal gaming convention. Buff stacking is made even worse in your game because of your unfixable dupe problem.
---
Thank you for your C.A.M.P. décor ideas and feedback. We appreciate it.

Lolz...

Waaaaaah..

Lemme guess, your job sucks, Your life sucks, your wife left you, your kids left college and hate you

Isn’t there some bridge you need to live under?

Good to hear its improved for you as well+

Yea I've always got those on

We really need new content.  My friends aren't quitting because of bug fixes, nerfs, and small QOL stuff.

They are BORED.  Stone cold bone deep BORED.

It sucks seeing your friends list say "offline, offline, offline, offline" in prime time.

I made a post about how to fix a lot of the current issues here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/?sort=new)

Sorry. I’m playing on Xbox

This is a prime example of why pacifism is a stupid moral and ethical position.
---
bugtehsda shill :)
---
You sure? I've never become wanted when one of the damage mutations triggered near another player. 
---
xxXpussydestroyerXxx Complained about being wanted when he destroyed camps... Nuff said.
---
Yeah and playing on a PvE server doesn't exclude you from PvPing or enjoying PvP. That's the point. Pretty simple.
---
&gt; I worry only children are left in this /r, that and people who paid lots of caps or really money for TSE and whine about it now.
---
Why do you feel it's ok to summarize an entire group of people so you can dismiss them? Seems real ignorant. 
---
Could it be radworms? They have been messing with mutation stats after the patch and hotfix, increasing and decreasing attributes. If it were to affect your mutation (assuming you have one) and increase the strength (twisted muscles I think) then your carry weight may go up. Also may be affecting maruspial (extra carry weight). At this point I wouldn't be surprised if radworms was affecting people who weren't mutated and simply have a stat boost from armor or a weapon etc.
---
300 / 400 / something.
---
Going mainly Assassin / Cavalier on my melee and going to eventually get around to doing Assassin / Sentinel on my ranged.
---
Why?  You at least got a cool looking helmet and some plastic figurines, didn't you?  Having said that, as a fellow PA edition owner, it'd be nice if Bethesda said "hey, sorry about the price drops, here's a $20 rebate or something".  Now having said that, I am not saying I'd like a refund or rebate.  It'd just be a cool thing (who doesn't like free money?).
---
Agile development gave me PTSD
---
At that price absolutely. Grab it. Take your time. They are working on it. Slowly and mildly painfully, but they are working on it. It's enjoyable, that's for sure. But definitely has it's issues. Nothing absolutely game breaking IMO. 
---
Oh, it’s rad worms causing that? I’ve seen that a few times
---
how does this post have 9 gold? Even if we are only 5% of the (dwindling) fo76 playerbase, that’s significant. Hell, even reps of Bethesda themselves comment here. What exactly is your point? There’s nothing left to defend for fallout 76- every week there’s a new bug or another fuck up. It’s like coming back to your abusive ex.
---
It's sad, of the 24 contacts I have, only 1 connects 
---
How about you guys have your meetings in game?
---
Probably just a lot of "whoa, this is fuuuucked"
---
Yup.
---
Every time I clicked play I would get a black screen for two seconds and then get kicked back to the desktop.
---
Tried repairing the game in the launcher, deleting the config files so it could make new ones, reinstalling my graphics drivers and disabling SLI, all of which had no effect.
---
Waiting for it to download again now.
---
For real dude. My day off too. All I wanted to do was tool around and get to lvl 50 so I can play with my ultracite armor (I’m 75% through lvl 49...)
---
Awww, did bethesda hurt your feelings?
---
Kinda sounds like you didn't know that playing video games is a hobby...
---
&gt; ...So if it feels like Bethesda is ignoring you... well it is because they kind of are in a way. They care about more than just you and your opinion about being the big dick swinging one-shot shotty badass that you use to be. They care about making sure the majority of players have a balanced and enjoyable time.
---
I don't know if you are familiar with the current state of Destiny, and how poorly Bungie handled the launch of D2, but it is this "cater towards the casuals" that lead that game into an almost unplayable state when it first launched.
---
Fallout 76 is not Fortnite, it is hardly a casual game. It is aimed towards fans of the RPG roots, with multiplayer in mind. The fact that everything is being dumbed down towards a game that caters towards a more hardcore audience is just baffling.
---
The Division, Anthem, and Destiny all fill in the void that Fallout 76 could have been for myself and many others. Unfortunately the scope of the game was too big to fill with meaningless events, dumbed down loot, and a perk system that makes every build feel so unimaginative and pointless. 
---
I'm not sure what they were/are going for with all the continuous nerfs, because at the end of the day balance =/=.
---
Slayerage wrote a huge post about this topic in D2, and his point was no one thinks back on Destiny and says "wow this game is balanced" they thought "holy shit, a rocket that homes, and splits into a wolpack and explodes again? that's awesome"  nerfing two shot and explosive rounds is not good for the health of the playerbase, it gave us a white whale to chase after, now without that, it's much less fun to see a legendary weapon drop. That isn't good for the game's health, maybe good for balance, but no one plays Fallout because it's balanced.
---
I appreciate your effort on this post, but i have to thoroughly disagree with the direction they are moving with this title, and the nerfs, i haven't played in a month.
---
We can certainly look into that or something like it whether it's here or a livestream. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Oof, I found another bootlicker.
---
That roof is painful, but worth it for an otherwise awesome look.
---
Is that a bug? Cause that sounds awlful.
---
Bortles!
---
Missing details about the following (off the top of my head):
---
* Unruly golfers don't spawn if you're higher level - i've had this quest in my journal for a while now.
---
* Atom Shop Vault-tec weapons workbench - Rotates ~45* after being placed in camp - often clipping through walls.
---
* Friend list sometimes empties until relog
---
* 'Recent' list often blank on login - not great after a crash
---
It's a joke captain obvious 
---
No dude I got a life this is my first time back on Reddit my bad. What again was the point of posting a bunch of recent links from mainstream media that only confirm what I said in my last post about this being weaponized meme warfare(is Rockstar paying you? Do you just enough jumping on the hate train for twitch views?) You're post had nothing to do with refuting what I said only actually proved my point. But it's funny that you think you're some badass internet commenter :) good for you buddy self esteems important you should go ask out that girl you e been too afraid to talk to. 
---
Artillery plans are  in fort defiance on the 4th floor. In the room with the pool table there’s a door with a laser gate go through there and it should be on a wooden desk. Might have to hop if someone grabbed it before you. 
---
Im not gonna like, at first i saw your post title and i was like "How the hell are there two promoted posts right next to each other".
---
cause with a title like that it looks like spam.
---
also yes, cause Bethesda hates the Chinese. 
---
Carry weight is erratic (again) since Patch 5, perhaps related to Deep Pocketed armor items.
---
Tuesday night, I was over-encumbered while exploring.  Found a workbench in the wilderness and scrapped/dropped items, which brought me back to 176/190 carry weight.  
---
The red Over-encumbered icon was visible on the HUD, I couldn't fast-travel, and AP was consumed while running (not sprinting).   BUT, I could still sprint normally.  
---
Entering and exiting Excavator power armor seemed to work as a temporary fix, until I became over-encumbered again.  
---
At least you don't ONLY give attention to YTers who blame the Nuka Dark scam on the 76 devs.
---
Xbox live is down per usual smh.
---
Now, when I auto scrap all my junk items, my previously created bulks are getting scrapped too. Seriously? Do you guys actually test what you put out there?
---
They need to do more gradual small balance changes to ALL of the builds.  I made a post about it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/?sort=new)
---
Pretty sure, one of my guild members rocks reactive plates and damage mutations and sits in pacifist mode a lot in our pow-wows. He gets wanted a lot in our shenanigans and we have to do mercy eatings.
---
Thanks for the info! I've always used guns, and never found a TSE weapon, so I guess this never effected me.  
---
Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
CONTENT
---
I've heard it's somewhere in the mist, somewhere in the future, maybe a week from now, maybe months from now.
---
Meanwhile what I haven't seen is my friends.  They seem to be missing.
---
Can you help me? :)
---
I was at the Monongah Power Plant workshop which a teammate owned and the defend event was going on. I clicked the symbol on the map to join the event and kept getting the 'can't fast travel when enemies are around' even though I was already at the event. I probably would have had to leave the area to a safe spot to fast travel back.
---
What? Why?
---
How about no?
---
Every single patch introduces new bugs or brings back old ones. I find it sad as hell that people feel the need to be thankful for this gross level of incompetence.
---
Dude, that head was on an incredible journey of self-discovery. Just let it go on it's way!
---
Another part of it is that the headlamp doesn't work while this bug is in effect.  If you can't get out of power armor, try your headlamp.  If both are borked, you're in this bug boat!
---
400+ hours in at this point. Maybe even closing on 500. I'd say 90% of the time the game is fun and interesting, and I'm always finding some new shit to read, or investigate, or whatever. That last 10% is pretty rough though. Blue screens semi-regularly that aren't explained by bad equipment like the Tesla charging barrel or targeting HUD. That shouldn't be mitigated by the bad equipment commentary either. This game taught me the PS4 had a blue screen for hard crashes. Long dogs too. Long dogs suck. Then there's invisible team mates. That sucks too. Not so bad after the TSE Nerf, since they can insta-kill me by standing in front of me. Stretchy world textures have literally cut the game world in half on multiple occasions. Loot not spawning, mods getting scrapped, the old damage bug making cool weapons do zero work, etc.
---
In my heart this game is a 9 for world, story telling, fun gameplay, etc.
---
In actual play this game gets a 6 for function. That means the game works as expected a majority of the time. Not the vast majority, but the majority. I don't think I've seen a triple A title with this many show stopping bugs in my life. I've been gaming since the NES launch, so I'm not kidding around. Thousands of games and probably close to 100,000 hours gaming lifetime. As a triple A title I expect at least an 8 for stability.
---
All that being said, I'll be on tonight. I'm leveling gladiator perks to see if I can drag a shishkabob kicking and screaming in viability, to use friendly fire for free heals. Cheers!
---
Wow yeah I just restarted my Xbox a few minutes ago and can’t sign in. Checked Xbox live status and boom, problem source found. Smh. Why is it so difficult for a guy to sit down and play a game on his day off?!
---
I've seen it on Ghram before.  I remember because I was hopping for Powered Gates and Mirror Ball plans.
---
Not sure where else.
---
/u/giantpunda I'm on PS4 and this is what I started working on last night:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18D-yEJvowtiMz7TK2g1Uy9zGCZ\_hULMq-oe1ifubv\_o/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18D-yEJvowtiMz7TK2g1Uy9zGCZ_hULMq-oe1ifubv_o/edit?usp=sharing)
---
I put an X in the columns where they are found.
---
That's why the reduced damage when not PvPing is there.
---
It just would need adjustment 
---
It's literally just cosmetics and if you don't want to spend a few minutes drinking quantum or killing a wendigo in a clown costume what are you doing 
---
personally I think that Bethesda hates you so much they don't even want to interfere with your enjoyment.
---
I've gotten bugs and disconnects. Sometimes it sucks, but can make a good stopping point for the day. So really it's bethesda saying I've played enough.
---
https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hotfix
---
&gt; If I devote 6 more slots of perception at best I can get it to 78.
---
Doesn't invest in perks that would give him 15 more damage points, then complains about not having enough damage. Okay then.
---
Weird. Might be just the reactive plates that do this, wouldn't know, I hate power armor.
---
Xbox live is messing up. Red Dead Online ain't workin either 
---
yeah but if you toss the grenades and run not much they can do except chase you around while the base is shelled 
---
Scrap All at a workbench scraps bulked items? You know, the bug which was introduced by a hotfix which addressed a bug...
---
I know right?
---
In mmos repeatability is usually required otherwise the first sealings ends the game for most.
---
Lore wise they seal the fissures. Game wise it's a group raid that can be repeated.
---
Hopefully that time machine on the monorail works eventually and we can go forward and back in time and see the effects of the changes in the world.
---
They've never played and they don't know, hence why I'm explaining it to them. I gave up around late December so I've missed some of the new fuck ups
---
The problem with the favorites wheel is one I hope gets fixed quickly.  It may not affect everyone but it can be a real problem for those of us it does.
---
I loved using it in FO4, and in FO76 it's super easy to keep up with ammo. If you haven't, try it out with the automatic receiver and VATS, It shoots absurdly fast. When they get the perks working for it a quad rifle would be hilarious to use.
---
Is the MIRV mod messed up? It doesn't do what I expect...
---
I thunk those would be a little hard to throw
---
What would you consider overblown?
---
Distance closers are pretty standard for melee v ranged, but they're often countered by snares or roots, which are countered by break frees etc. That chain of move and countermove isn't really in this game.
---
I think also including a bait system to lure Yaois, radtags and others would be a nice touch as well.
---
I ask myself this all the time except I get the opposite... 
---
I get most major bugs and a good number of the small ones. Doesn’t prevent me from playing but it’s really frustrating and some have persisted since the beta. 
---
My brother has it worse and for some reason when we play together we get all sorts of weird stuff happening.  We’re grossly casual too, we just roam around looking at things and exploring. We do quests we come across but they’re crazy buggy. 
---
Just the other day we tried to do the Bolton Green event where you have to set the tables, most of the plates or centerpieces couldn’t be picked up for some reason and we cleary failed the mission. Once the timer ran out it said we failed, then seconds later it said we completed it and gave us the rewards and experience. Was only the start of the bugs for that play through... 
---
Yea some of the patch was bad with old bugs coming back, but even with the nerfs the game is still fun. even with my two shot only guns being weaker im happy because its not just point and shoot as the TSEs were, its a return to how i played at the start of beta where im relying on my wits and using my surroundings to survive. sure, the game needs new content and there are a few more balances that need to be done however all ive seen is whining no matter what is done. rome wasnt built in a day.
---
conversely, i feel a big thing is that many players focus too much on numbers, and yea i get it; its and MMO so youre gonna have players min/maxing and finding the OP builds and such. the thing is even before 76 fallout to me was about surviving in a harsh wasteland while walking through the halls learning about the old world that came before the great war. when it came to survival i loved the FNV and F4 mods dust and frost, where the game became a constant fight for survival where fo76 feels like those mods to me.
---
energy weapons are getting boosted ""soon"" so says last info both in damage and durability 
---
Wow... The down votes...
---
We found this fast travel trick the other day. Somebody had the converted Munitions Factory and was doing some shady s*** inside of it. There was no way in at all so we walked around and kept trying to find some way to get in there. 
---
Look like they were duping but since I don't have proof other than folks logging out and logging back in and the ownership of the workshop constantly changing, I wont.
---
Anyways one of our buddies that wasn't there yet wanted to come and see what the commotion was about so we fast travel to one of us that was looking through the Gap in the wall and their barricades. It fast traveled him inside the converted Munitions Factory.
---
Everyone else fast travel to to the same guy and we all showed up inside the converted Munitions Factory. Things got super sketchy in there really quick and a fight broke out after about 5 minutes with the other people leaving the server directly afterwards.
---
So if you want to get into some place that's locked get somebody else on your team to stand as close as they can to an interior corner of the building and fast travel to them. If they are in a good spot you may just appear inside.
---
Any bottle sure, not just glass. The bottles are already easy enough to find.
---
Also give me a bottle in junk every time I drink a bottle of something, damnit.
---
This is why in all of their other games, that had mod support, the community fixed what they had no idea how to fix. They cut mod support and the community of programmers that know what they are doing can't fix their broken game. I refuse to play till they get the damned disconnection issues fixed or at least let me rejoin and not lose all of my workshops. 
---
I agree that explosive needed a nerf but they should have left demo expert and 2 shot alone
---
Buhu internet is hard :( 
---
Btw I upvoted you because whats written here are just so important
---
I did get loot from her just note the legendary loot, so that wouldn't make any sense why the legendary didn't spawn.
---
I understand your complaints, but if memory serves I haven’t played a AAA game in recent years that allows you earn its premium currency as fast (or as effortlessly/naturally) as FO76, I’ll regularly earn $2-3 a day over a 3 hour play session. It’s not much but it adds up over time considering I’ve bought a few things from the Atom Shop, have more than 2,000 atoms to spare, and still haven’t spent a single cent on the game. Even games like Fortnite: Battle Royale throttle the time it takes to earn their currency by making the only viable way to earn it weekly challenges. 76 came with the new Xbox I bought on Black Friday, so considering I’ve had countless hours of fun, met new people, and have *theoretically* made money on this game (without spending any) I’m willing to forgive the Atom Shop.
---
In saying that though I am well informed that this game is quite “iffy” on when it wants to work. Not particularly time-wise, but person-wise. Many people I talk to run into problems that I don’t and vice-versa. Your results may vary.
---
Welcome to the "Doesn't roll PA club!"
---
I'd just like to see a way to hide the impact zone of a nuke.  I haven't ever launched one yet, but I kind of want it to be private, at least for a  little while.  It'd be cooler to me if received the warning if you're close to the zone, and not everybody on the map.
---
More like there's too many. To be honest I'm passed being upset, I find it pretty funny now how a major videogame company could be this inept
---
Witch!!! 
---
/s
---
I would *love* to see the quantum nuke in action. That sounds awesome.
---
I also like the idea not only of diverse ammo types (and a major buff) for these weapons, but also diverse craftable ammo types for other weapons. Armor-piercing, explosive, incendiary, subsonic, etc.—and on that note, I frankly think the Explosive legendary effect should be completely nixed.
---
By the way, I'm a TSE user. But explosives can get out of hand, as we saw before the TSE nerf, and although explosives *should* be powerful, there should be ammo weight and crafting costs for wielding that power. From what I recall, New Vegas did ammo crafting and variety quite well. And switching between ammo types as the situation called for brought new gratification to combat and crafting strategy.
---
This is the second time in like two days, it’s ridiculous! Idk why their service is so unstable.
---
Yea the log in is really bad. I log on early am EST and have to back out to find a server where I can actually move. Even if I'm in a server with few players. 
---
My PA chest piece seems to unequip when fast traveling. Doesnt seem to effect carry weight for some odd reason
---
When in excavator armour my carry weight fluctuates so much I dont have a clue what it is. I can go from 330-370.
---
I become Over encumbered even being 80lbs less than my max.
---
Fast traveling to Berkley I keep getting attacked by enemies I cant see then I cant move. 
---
My mutations work whenever they want too ish. 
---
Charleston landfill spawns enemies you cant see or kill
---
Powering Poseidon to 100% power boxes dont do anything
---
I probably should have clarified, but i thought it was obvious, but I didn't say which bugs were and were not added back. I just stated that a lot and probably most of the bugs that people are saying came back actually didn't, I didn't say that those particular ones did or didn't. Y O U D I D N T R E A D M Y C O M M E N T S T O P B E I N G A F O L L O W E R. I know I will receive more bad carma for saying this but I don't care.

Lolz aren’t you the one looking for a jerk to circle?
---
Stalker..
---
Gun Runners didn't require multiple playthroughs, with s little planning. Even the "complete three 3 Star challenges" trophy could be done on any file by completing "Crackerjack Timing," "Deathclaw Pro Hunter," and "Man-Machine Interface."
---
If anything, the single largest grind that I had to do just for a trophy was the Nuka-cade ticket stuff in Fallout 4: Nuka-World.
---
no1curr
---
No Melee is not op. Stop saying such shit, Bethesda might just believe you.
---
Ranged weapons are just to weak, due to all enemies beeing fucking bullet sponges 
---
I can one shot most things in the game with my melee character.
---
With that being said, I don't want them to nuke nerf melee either.  Then I'll have 0 of 2 viable builds.
---
They really needed to BUFF other builds, and do a small nerf to TSE / melee.
---
Grind doesn't equal fun.  If you've worked hard to get a good character going, they should be able to rekt face on things.
---
Balance is key.  League of Legends does a decent job at it.  It's not rocket science.....lol
---
Hahah I'd say it the best last photo ever.
---
Oh boy this is great, the sub is beginning to forget about all of the bs again. Bethesda screwed up in this patch, I have no idea why the heck you are defending them or why this has even gotten to the front page. 
---
So you're uninstalling it?
---
I would love to be able to get a brewbuddy aka "Drinking Buddy" from fallout 4 as well.  I want my ice cold nuka cola damn it.
---
Oh, I need mirror ball too. Good to know. Have to try to find that dude again! I've only seen him twice since Beta. 
---
It’s simple. You are just more tolerant towards bugs or don’t consider them to be bugs. I am sure your Bobby pin increased to 0.1 lbs in the last patch but you either didn’t notice or don’t care. It’s still a bug and it exists 
---
Guns breaking to fast check
---
Enemies becoming bullet sponge check 
---
Mutations “flickering” effects check
---
Spawning meatpiles ( dissapering ) check 
---
Food and hydration depleting super fast check 
---
I went from having a well stocked inventory of things and an efficient weight now I’m pretty much frustrated to see that logging and playing for a few minutes or hours turning in to a chore.
---
Maybe some things got fixed , but my single player ( and with friends ) experience are getting smaller and more hard to appreciate , where’s I have almost all power armor , awesome weapons , and awesome perks but shit sometimes these small bugs will end your ( mines) experience.
---
*Atoms not being granted properly on quest 
---
*lengendary with no loot

So yes concur to say it sucks and slowly the interest ( whatever was left ) is slowly dying 
---
I have to keep my friends list clean for trading purposes.  So I only have "always play with" people on my list.
---
Last night it was 1 person.  The night before it was that same 1 person.
---
Not good :(
---
Every time they mention that the designers play it in-house I keep thinking "Ya, okay, and maybe in a closed community of a few dozen people, where you all know each other personally and have to work together, few of these issues would really become so obvious and huge as when thousands of people get their hands on it"
---
The Russians invented Molotov cocktails. You think they would use anything other than vodka bottles?
---
Been playing since official release, spent about 5k in the store. Got them all by completing in game challenges. Have almost 2k left, it's really not as bad as people say. Of course I log on daily for about 3/4 hours and really try to hit dailies, weeklies, and challenges
---
I better not let him know that I only play Destiny 2 about an hour a week too! I could get in BIG trouble. 
---
Not sure what the intent of your reply is, that is a definition but it's not the one in the wiki... I'm saying the wiki defines what the word means but does not cite a reference on which it's based. Several of the citations for other parts of the article contradict it. My comment was to say that getting a definition from the wiki is not a reliable source... even the definition you linked is different from the one in the wiki.
---
Checks out 👌🏽 you’re brilliant 
---
Anything being done about trophies/achievements that don’t unlock for some people?  
---
The Fallout Forever trophy didn't unlock for me.
---
There are a lot of people getting accidental wanted levels when a single bullet hits a wall or something. 
---
Incidental damage like that probably shouldn’t result in a bounty. Actually destroying a camp object should. 
---
Is this your first time buying?  I didn't realize that when you buy stuff, it doesn't show up in your inventory but instead you have to craft it, etc.
---
To be fair, barrel length plays a part in in real-world ballistic performance.  You load the same make of 9mm parabellum in a glock 19 and an mp5, and you're going to get a faster bullet with more energy out of the longer barrel.  It's not a tremendous difference, but definitely noticeable.  That's why short barrel rifles and snub nosed revolvers shoot huge fireballs out of the muzzle.  It's all lost energy.  If you don't believe me, here's numbers.  
---

That being said, I agree that pistols are pretty awful in 76.  The two semi-auto options are the 10mm and pipe pistol, and neither are desirable after level 10-15.  The reload on the single action is almost as bad as the black powder rifle, only that gun actually does a lot of damage.
---
I was going to add a couple cards in pistols as a lightweight ranged option on my new melee alt, but opted for commando instead.  Some many more options.  Since I'm going to be tromping around with 15 str and power armor anyways, what does a 15-20 lb automatic rifle matter?
---
The worst thing is that they add objects for a limited time, sometimes one can not spend so many hours to gather the atoms. If the game was at its best, without problems, I would easily buy objects with my money. 
---
COCKJUGS
---
Man, I kid you not, but firing that beast in automatic is a great feeling. Afterwards you are treated to a celebratory choo choo.
---
Go to the corpse, see the loot and it's actually the 3-star weapon you've been farming for weeks, then another player walks between you and the SBQ before you can grab the loot. 
---
And then disconnect.
---
Yeah but this sub, and the main fallout sub is just endless posts about how awful the game is and how everyone is quitting the game.
---
I'm subbed to all just so i have a fair mix. I see the flaws in the game but the positives outweigh them for me so I dont see a point in complaining
---
Toons.
---
This is currently happening to me 100% of the time.  PLEASE HELP!
---
When I was a kid and teenager I got a game because the box looked cool. I would also rent games. Which you can still do. I see words like responsibility and accountability. As far as I'm concerned this game is revolutionary and looks like it's was incredibly hard to make. There's no monthly subscription fee for their servers either. Like WoW. Heads would be rolling? For a game dude? No, this is not what people's attitude was towards games back in the day. It's just getting delusional at this point. Bethesda is trying to make a good game. They don't hate you or not care about you. Shit is just getting so distorted and ugly. The price of games hasn't gone up for a long time, even though realistically it should. And buying a game doesn't mean you own half the company and can make all these entitled demands. If 60 dollars is so expensive to you then maybe you should be putting all this energy elsewhere. Enjoy the game and play it. If you don't then try to get a refund. If you can't get a refund because you have been playing it for hundreds of hours then move on. It's just a God dam game for God's sake.
---
None it will break before you’re able to shoot 500 rounds 
---
I say the same thing to you, that I say to everyone, who says what you said: clever and original.
---
I think I consume about 5 corn soup an hour, though I have the speed demon mutation and my only food/drink perk is 1x dromedary (because thirst moves seems to move than hunger).
---
I know using chems (including stimpaks) increases hunger/thirst.
---
I've wondered if sprinting or combat increases them too, but I don't know.
---
I want to dual wield pistols and have VATS fire each per trigger.  Problem solved.
---
That changed dramatically with the last patch, Lucky break does not appear to be working at all now, and my weapons are breaking much quicker.
---
Pre-Patch I could run 1000 rounds through my TSE Handmade &amp; still not need to repair it, Post Patch, I'm lucky to get to 200 rounds before it breaks, starting at 200%.
---
I know. I bought the Blackbird Power armor paint, Costumes, Camp items, ect since the game came out.
---
Bethesda is doing such a bang up job fixing it so far right? They have almost no experience actually fixing a game as oblivion forward they had the community do it and the community is trying to do it for them, yet again, but they ignore how to fix it.
---
Pistols tend to work better with high AGI and LCK builds because VATS for then is cheap. There was a video not too long ago of a guy downing a scorchbeast in 17 shots with a .44 with the AP legendary affix. But he did use VATS and a lot of crit shots. As mentioned elsewhere the western revolver is an all around superior weapon and if possible you should go for a legendary of that.
---
Hahaha. That's funny. I'd leave my door unlocked if asshats would shut it when they leave. 
---
Done.
---
ah ok, just making sure :)
---
I have no idea why it wouldn't be showing up, but I would be pissed off.  I hope it gets fixed soon for you. 
---
Can’t seem to find it myself, do lmk if u find it. 💙
---
How about a timer on events? I love joining one only got it to have 5 seconds left.
---
I will say, dont use green/yellow/red. Colourblind people have a hard enough time as it is.

[XBox Live is experiencing issues](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status)
---
I know this must have been annoying but this totally made me lols to the point I almost my lost my drink through my nose. There is a lot of complaining about the game and I can’t argue with the issues. I enjoy fallout 76 and until I get bored I will play. But this made my day thank you sharing! 
---
Thank you for this detailed feedback. It's something we can look into.
---
I'm the same. Very few issues. Some odd texture glitches during the beta (turns out it was driver update that fixed it anyway). I've seen the weird spaghetti things a couple of times. I get a fair bit of stutter I suppose. About 1 or 2 crashes about every 20 hours of game play. That's pretty much it.
---
I'm still enjoying it at around 400 hours in.
---
I've seen heavy combat armor plans at Phoenix.  Only one will show up at a time, though.  I've gotten chest and arms so far, and they're pretty expensive.
---
Well, for one thing I have put every point possible into shot gunner perks. Sounds like you, like a lot of other people, just put one point into each level of rifleman. 
---
When you aren't using an OP weapon every single point of damage counts. 
---
A lot of people with the TSE builds were able to get by with sinking just one point into rifleman. I have all nine levels of shot gunner plus bloody mess.
---
Stop reposting this.
---
Link from Bethesda so confirming? Sounds like BS to me.
---
Oouu don't say that lol hate incomiiiiiing!!
---
I had a weird bug where I had 50 agility and it showed. Super fun to stand next to a bunch of deathclaws and they can't see me 🤣 but after I blew myself up with a grenade later on it was back to normal. 
---
I run stealth sniper and have noticed the caution thing going when I killed all the enemies and moved around. Fast travel still worked but my sneak attacks were affected. 
---
I thought it was some invisible enemy that kept searching for me. But relogged and it didn't happen anymore. 
---
Probably a subterranean scorched champion trolling me 
---
In the next patch when you select "Scrap All Junk" it will comply, scrapping all junk.
---
Everywhere.
---
This. This. 1000 times this. 
---
Okay, bye then I guess?
---
So brave, such wow.
---
With Weapon Artisan repairing it to 200% I generally get much more than that - like more than 2 clips (more than 1000 rounds).  It usually lasts an entire scorched earth.
---
I've gotten a ton of Atoms from playing casually, only spent about a half of them. 
---
There isn't a problem.
---
I respect what you're saying, but I would like to disagree on the point on the supposed elitism of people with complaints. I've read many complaint posts, and it seems to me that there are as many casual players upset about 76's many issues as there are elite players. It just seems like the most emphatic, rage-charged, boycott-level complaints are coming from people like the guy who's managed 760 hours of play in 79 days; he clearly has time on his hands to formulate seething complaint post wrought from excessive hours of observation.  Casual players are more likely to take extended breaks from play until some important QoL and stability issues are addressed, because they want to maximize their enjoyment of 76 in the small amount of time they have to game.
---
I've read about players who convinced friends to buy the game, then had so many issues playing together that entire groups of friends didn't find the game functional enough to be fun. Those players don't sound like hardline elitists to me. Meanwhile, I've seen hardline level 200+ elitists tear down the legitimate complaints of casual players, belittling them as if the only problems that could possibly matter are endgame problems. The complaints exist on a wide spectrum. It seems to me that the sub is pointing to problems across every level of play, which need to be addressed if the game is to run for years and years as you suppose it is meant to. The elitists, when they aren't being dicks to casuals who don't have several hours to game every day, also have valid points as they pave the way by pointing out endgame issues that casuals are bound to run into eventually. 
---
Squeaky wheels get the grease, so take the criticism, boycotting, and rage quitting with a grain of salt, and realize that the message in all the negativity is that Bethesda needs to step up and provide paying fans at all levels of play with a better experience. 
---
If you use the first card of each shotgun perk instead of one thats maxed you could have 10% more dmg with same cost
---
I’m seeing it at wotga vender as well. Might have to be a certain level?
---
Why is a CAMP item worth more than a life? You don't gain wanted status for shooting another player unless you kill him, while one stray bullet hitting a wooden wall suddenly makes you a criminal.
---
There should be a threshold of damage done or items destroyed before you become wanted.
---
Naw as they couldn't guarantee the game wouldn't just be sold off and they get to keep their pretty new remastered copies.
---
Ahh yea. I read your post wrong. You will need to complete it. I’m not sure on the vendors.
---
Sounds good on both counts. I see quite a few replies saying beer bottles are ubiquitous, but that's not the point IMO—variety is good, and as I'm sure a few of us know from real life, a glass bottle is a glass bottle as long as you throw it hard enough haha.
---
I also like the idea of drinking anything that comes in a bottle leaving an empty bottle in your inventory. Isn't that how it worked in New Vegas? Maybe I'm remembering wrong.
---
That said, to really capitalize on the dev time required. molitovs crafted using different bottles should have different effects. If nothing else, different colors of flames. Actually, I'd be satisfied with just that, and would actually use molitovs just to make battles more colorful. I don't use molitovs currently but now I want this…
---
The key is balance.  Right now there's no balance to the development.  It's 100% bug fixes, nerfs, and small QOL stuff.
---
They do need to make CONTENT a priority, but still work on the other stuff too.
---
I made a post about it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/?sort=new)
---
It's possibly, my alt is only 48, might have been 46 or 7 when I checked. 
---
Nice! Somehow I've missed that you can sort.
---
It's flawed, but if typically a base is represented by a similar percentage across the board, assumptions can be made. For example, the op of the post can make the assumption the base that actively posts is roughly 5%. If that's somewhat safe to assume, it can somewhat safely that the game isn't retaining as many players if the subreddit isn't retaining as many. Looking further at top posts over the past few months, there were more higher upvoted posts launch by what looks to be a good amount. Therefore you can make a somewhat safe assumption that since the online community is declining, so is the overall community. 
---
Now if what I said isn't true than making any assumptions about the percentage of the playerbase who use thus subreddit isn't true or is a poor assumption also as that is the metric I'm basing all my points from.
---
The challenge for ‘roaming the wasteland’ or something like that, not sure which category it is in, but it says x/76 hours.  When x reaches 76 you’ll get some atoms.  Then I assume it goes to x/760?  Wonder if anybody has played that much yet.
---
LG 21:9 Looks the same as it did before the patch for the PC version.
---
Sacrificial Blade mod for the Machete adds a star, along with bleeding and poison damage.

Yes! I used the brick set for my exterior walls and then the barn for my interior, but I still dislike that there's an "unfinished" side.

Sounding angry at Bethesda gets upvotes. Bonus for putting Bethesda on the title.
---
Nevermind 
---
geezus next level whining here we go.  A TSE with 60% explosives perk is better than 95% of any other legendary combination.  Game can't just be one effing weapon.
---
Yeah.  It totally ruined my golf club farming.  Everything aggroed on the base and I got wanted for trying to get a piece of the action with an explosive rifle and damaging a wall.  The turrets were mad at me, but didn't do any damage for some reason.  It was just annoying while trying to loot corpses and not being able to see anything but 'splosions.
---
I’m guessing that it has something to do with having a team mate, have them stand next to one of the camp walls, and then you fast travel to their location.  
---
I’m also guessing that the team mate has to be facing the right direction as you land a certain distance behind them.  
---
So, if I’m right, in this case you would end up inside the locked CAMP.
---
It’s just a guess, I might be off track...
---
How does martial artist affect the gatling gun?

This is probably totally unrelated, but when crouching does anyone else occasionally see the name and health bar of an enemy who isnt't actually there?

---
What about the [RadShield](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/RadShield) which can be obtained during the quest [An Organic Solution](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/An_Organic_Solution)? Is it being affected by Traveling Pharmacy or does it not fall under the same category as Rad-X?
---
The Rad Worms bug which buffs mutations while under the effects of the disease is something I came across today as well.
---
I have also come across the two variants of Royal Jelly which are an item that is needed to make Black Berry Honey Crisps, but only one of them is listed as an AID item and can be used for the recipe, but the problem is it can only be found one per server behind  Middle Mountain Cabins. The other variant is listed as a junk item and I've found it ONCE on Honeybeasts but it cannot be used for the recipe. 
---
I agree. I spend most of my time playing with friends, so I’d gladly spend money on aesthetics if the price was right. I want to spend my time in game playing, no necessarily chasing down random achievements for 10 atoms. 
---
nice! didn't know that, thanks!
---
Do you have a source for that? I'm genuinely curious, I always just max my INT out as high as it will go.
---
Welcome to an outdated engine that they tried to slap a multiplayer component to!
---
Honestly im just going to keep playing so i can enjoy the game before they nerf the fuck out of everything and its time to quit.

its what happens with every online game because people with too much time fuck up all the metrics..
---
"OMG all these players reached level 100 in a week" yet they fail to see they were people not working or kids with no jobs....

I know they arent taking demographics on any stats they collect so they only see player progression as a whole.

---
**Cap Stashes:** To help address cap exploits, caps stashes have been turned into containers, which allows them to properly reset and provide players with instanced loot. 
---
The so called exploit was people server hopping to collect them. So thus, server hopping to collect anything is an exploit.
---
I'm fairly certain that you can obtain that plan through capturing/defending workshops.

Hmmm, I'm not sure now that I'm looking at the numbers. This is honestly my XP build, it just helps for crafting. I might have some other buff I wasn't aware of, several of the unyielding pieces are 3\* so maybe some have INT or something else.
---
If you think this is the first game to accidentally ban innocent people I’ve got a bridge to sell you.  If those people didn’t cheat then they’ll get unbanned. My whole point is that living in fear of a ban is silly when barely a handful of people have come forward saying they got banned. If people were getting banned for simply making ammo then absolute assloads of people would be taking to the internet and freaking out. As it is, I hardly think fear of being wrongly banned is an important addition to the list of problems with this game. 
---
No.
---
It's a product that a company sells expecting a considerable sum of money. "it's just a game" is such a reductive and dismissive stance I cannot tell if you are an idiot or an asshole.
---
Oh yeah. And Fusion Cores are draining WAY FASTER too.
---
Can you bring a PC into the meeting and make some of them play it for a little while?
---
Hey look, a troll
---
Better than me chasing those damned chickens in power armor wielding a serrated machete....
---
Much needed post. It's easy to get on the hate hype train and join in on the complaining. I play about 12 hours a week since Beta and only have a level sixty something character. I feel like I've been doing a lot of quests recently, but I'm only now finishing up the Top the World quests (i think...). Never dropped a nuke or faced a scortchbeast yet and I had to Google what TSE meant, never-mind actually having one. 
---
Screwing up a patch like that is a bummer, but I probably wouldn't have noticed if it wasn't for this sub, especially since it will be fixed within a week or so. I'm too busy meticulously building my house and dicking around the wasteland, solo, with my heavy sledgehammer, ignoring the people telling me this is a multiplayer game. 
---
All they had to do was out a damage cap on the weapons.....
---
No, sadly not
---
Does that receiver affect damage to scorchbeasts?
---
As someone that repeatedly makes that argument I'm sympathetic. But there is a time horizon at which you can say "they should have hired more programmers and less artists". We're not nearly there yet, but there will come a time when it is a legitimate criticism.
---
Doh, I think you might be right! Well, I am a fool.
---
People expect the food to be perfect because they will only be enjoying it for 1 hour. And later it just comes out your ass and down a toilet. How can you play something you don't enjoy for 100 hours?
---
While we're at it, would be nice if the hoods didnt make me bald in the process thet makes them literally unusable for me since my character is female.
---
None anymore.  No incentive at all.  I did the event 3 times and never went back.  Rewards aren't worth the time investment.
---
Also stop people with unconstructive critisicm that is no help in improvement. And don't compare them to EA they are no where close
---
Seems to only be melee weapons and armour pieces, that was my bad.

These cringy posts about apologies, feelings, emotions...break up posts. They are sad. Not sad in a meaningful way. Sad in a pathetic way. Not a whale stuck on a beach sad. Kind of like a human whale in a Walmart Scooter drinking wine from a Pringles can sad

Did you cure rad worms?
---
Found one!

r/woosh

This is so easy for the rest of us to forget. Thanks for mentioning it.
---
u/Greyfox1625's suggestion seems like an elegant solution that would work for everyone.
---
I will have to drop one or two of my small water purifiers. I run three atm, but I don't get back to my camp all that often. I liked to be able to grab 5 or 6 purified water when I did make it there. I just figured I was picking up a crap ton of purified water and not realizing it. Cool, ty. 
---
I think I see what you mean. The more damage it does the quicker it breaks?
---
Does he even work for them any more ???because Mr.Positive has been M.I.A since launch !!! It’s fucking amazing the level of bullshit people will accept !! My server crashed 13 times in a row last night , all non ghoul 3 star legendaries  ( sup mutants, assorted  creatures etc.) don’t drop any legendary loot!!! Certain creatures during scorched earth became bullet sponges no matter how much ballistic damage was dealt to them their health meter never dropped !!! I was playing with 14 other players in the mix -everyone gave up after 53 minutes ,most of them being completely out of ammo !! WTF!!! Injury to insult for all claiming that were bitching because of TSE nerfing I have been playing daily since BETA and I’ve never received a single TSE  anything-  ever in this game, not once !!!! I’ve been present at over 16 successful scorched earth runs with my trusty axe ! I’ve done uranium fever 56 times and have never received a TSE weApon!!!  Talk about broken RNG !!! BOS Forbidden knowledge quest I’m at over a hundred tries and have yet to receive a BOS  paint job , so for me at least this game has been somewhat broken ..... just a little !!! And yet people have the nerve to say that’s whining????!!!! But you know , u can still buy more overpriced shit (that you had free in FO4 by the way)in the atom store without any glitches at all!!!! I’m sure I’ll get some a- hole snarky response from some arm chair warrior that I’m a mouth breathing , cry baby so “F—U” in advance !!!
---
MMLAFGA?
---
It'll likely be tomorrow at some point. I'm also on EST send me an xbox invite b00m 0n y0u 
---
Just try selling golf shirts in Whitesprings. Usually several locations to find them.
---
What shady shit were they doing?
---
Yeah, I showed that in one of the screenshots.
---
Some folks also use the cash register. But yeah, I use the luggage, too. 
---
For me, I just want the basics fixed. If I attack things, they should die. If I put on fancy armor, I shouldn't become an odd ghoul shape and scare children, they should also stop making bobby pins out of cast iron. 
---
If all I had to worry about were making things perfectly balanced, or making events give different or better rewards then everything would be so much better. The big issue is that just doing the regular ol ass stuff in this game is hard or something does not even work.
---
What is a tse build?  5pts in demo expert?
---
The worst is insulting people who are still enjoying the game.
---
"Fanboy, shill, idiot"
---
Show us on the doll where Todd touched you...
---
I don't know what to say, man. grab a dictionary I guess? because the word "objective" does have context. it implies factual things. and opinions aren't factual.
---
so *of course* I was talking about factual things. it wouldn't make sense otherwise. why would anyone use the the word "objective" to specify opinions, which are subjective in nature? better yet, why would anyone assume such an absurd paradox?
---
I would rather not have this become a Windows Store exclusive, the Bethesda store exclusives are bad enough
---
This also worked for me.   Scrapped everything and worked with a clean slate.
---
Redbox. And I got a refund easily for battlefield 5
---
I never had them pre patch
---
I agree in part with your assessment. 
---
I've played several hours each of the past 2 days though. Have still enjoyed the experience. 
---
True I forgot Microsoft bought them out 
---
Sacrificial Blade mod does on Machetes.
---
You don't have a separate weapon for the Silo fight?
---
I have one photograph pose that is unlocked only with one of my three characters.
---
Triggered much? The truth sucks, yeah?
---
Suggestion for Camp Decor: 
---
Non-destructible weapon/armor displays. 
---
Essentially just like the ones from Fallout 4, but make them non-lootable and non-destructible by other players. Once built, they would allow the player to display a single item from their stash. 
---
This would give players something to do with all the cool stuff we find but don’t need to use and still don’t want to throw away. 
---
I’d give you serious bonus points if you figured out a way to tie it in to player vending. Effectively letting us put price tags on the items so camp visitors could buy them when passing through. 
---
Yes that's what I heard, and I think it's true. I had been running a normal lever action up until I was level 80 and I traded for a tse lever action. Wouldn't get nearly as many shots out of it.
---
It’s meant to upgrade the level of the weapons, not make new ones. So you take your level 25 Voice of Set, and craft a level 35 one. Etc.
---
Huh? Enlighten me oh wise worker of the cards
---
It's still smaller than a Mini Nuke!
---
Whitespings is full of ghouls and maybe 5-6 golf outfits?
---
Mothman eggs can make around like 24 omelettes with no mobs
---
It'll probably sit on my system until i need the space, as most unplayed games tend to do 
---
Did it delete your photos or did you try to fixed the Blue Screen by deleting your save data?
---
lol one stand out game?  are you 12? They've been making THE premier western RPGs since Morrowind (and some argue before that).  Skyrim really wasn't even as good as FO3 and maybe even Oblivion.
---
Oof 
---
Also, "producer letter" style posts are good for this as well. Would be great to see one with some context as to how things launched in the state they did, why there continue to be so many issues including re-introducing bugs from one update to the next, and what the team is doing to meaningfully address the issues moving forward. Won't be fun or happy probably, but it'd go a long way in addressing concerns. Maybe Todd Howard could even chime in after he sold so many folks on a grand vision that's been...well...a bit rough to say the least.
---
Because the communications so far have been pretty good from y'all on the CM side of things and we have some details about upcoming content, but there's a complete black hole of information regarding just what the hell is going on behind the scenes that's deeply concerning for the health and future of the game. At least from an outside perspective.
---
Welcome to a multiplayer survival game.
---
7k sub is a wasteland.
---
That looks really neat perched up on the rocks, nice build.
---
Of all the issues? 
---
It is not brutal. 
---
I believe, bird bones+marsupial+strange in numbers+party.
---
It shouldn't be, cause I was able to buy the artillery plans quite easily at the BoS vendor prior to completing most of BoS missions though I haven't seen the plans on the vendor bot Phoenix's list since the patch  (I'll check again later to make sure it's there).
---
I completely disagree. I'm happy to see ongoing dialogue here between BGS reps and the player base. Would you prefer they not communicate or acknowledge the issues we're presenting to them? Because when you paint their efforts disingenuous, that's exactly what you encourage them to do.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm 450hrs and 248lvls into the game and have experienced many of the frustrations brought up here, but we're getting a regular stream of fixes in a game that requires many. It takes time, and I appreciate both the dev time and the communication going into it.
---
somebody mentioned a seeded RNG being used for loot tables in another thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj11j2/unofficial\_but\_comprehensive\_bug\_roundup\_jan\_2019/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj11j2/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_jan_2019/)
---
I got caught by this too. I had a bunch of bulk that scrapped on me and went overburdened. I have to re-bulk everything now. So much for my stock of plastic.
---
My lvl 50 double single action revolver went from a viable weapon to use against lvl 30's to only equipped so I can walk faster.
---
Wait... You mean to tell me that you got 18 minutes into a SBQ fight and didn't disconnect?
---
What black magic rituals are you enacting?
---
Level 153, multiple characters, never seen a 2 star or above legendary gun drop. It’s always been rolling pins and pool cues or other junk melee weapons. 
---
I had to buy the stuff with caps, or trade up serums and plans.
---
Maybe check at 50 be my guess?
---
Fortnite does the same thing. You can earn some v-bucks once in a while, but the rate progression seems to be even slower than Fallout 76. Just saying.
---
Is that so wrong to say? And it's not a defense, it's an objective statement. 
---
People are upset and wanting to vent. It's a natural reaction when things don't go your way. *All* of the subs are a microcosm of the vocal minorities in the game. The average player probably doesn't even wander in here because the average person just enjoys a medium and that's it. They don't want to talk about it or research or get really into it. They just play and go their way. People who come to forums do so with the intent to talk. And one of the best ways to cause people to talk is to make them unhappy.
---
I see the flaws in the game, but I still play and enjoy when I do because it lets me play the way I most enjoy playing open-world games: ignore the story and do what I want. And I can do it *with* my SO which is a huge plus imo. If I run into a bad glitch, I'll complain about it because that brings the glitch to the attention of the people who need to see it, otherwise I generally don't bother. But that doesn't mean I can't see why people would be upset given the extent of the latest round of nerfs. Those are pretty *deep* cuts in effectiveness after all and if your character build was developed around explosives - which is a valid RP choice beyond trying to min-max - you're *going* to be upset about it.
---
As for filthy casuals, I'm actually fine with there not being a lot of criticism there. I'm just not cool with the criticism being weighted towards anyone having issues, being negative towards other subs, and donning some *thick* rose colored glasses before looking at the game. Which is what I was seeing before I unsubbed from there. 
---
Last night i was on a server where 3 nukes were dropped back to back. 15+ showed up whey time.
---
She wilted in 10mins or less every time. Why?  TSE's
---
I like this new trend. 
---
Add it to the pile.
---
“couple hundred hours” is likely the culprit. I’m in the same boat as you are both in hours and incident rate of issues. I think a lot of these posts are either 1) exaggerated for venting or karma reasons or 2) from people that have played 2-3x more than we have. The player who has logged 700 hours is bound to run into more issues than the 150 hour player. 
---
And, because human brains are wired this way, people are much more likely to remember and talk about bad stuff than good stuff. The 700 hour player ranting about the two or three times they saw spaghetti dog is completely trivializing the other 698 hours played that didn’t have an issue, you know?
---
I’ve seen some of the issues people post about, but not nearly in sufficient frequency for me to stop playing or curse Bethesda with my every breath.
---
you're making it sound like the only prblem with Fo76 is that "the experience isn't polished enough"
---
no, that's not the problem at all. the problem is that I can seldom name a game in recent memory that messed up as bad. doesn't matter if they're new, small or inexperienced. this is unacceptable.
---
For that price, go for it. Like others have said, take your time and smell the roses. The world is big and there is a lot to explore. If all you want to do is power level, you may get bored quick. 
---
Well I left a ton of stuff in the front yard as "trash" but it was almost all usable items, basically everything in my house except mine and my wife's computer equipment, our bedroom furniture and clothes. I figured it shouldn't take a rocket scientist to understand the free stuff was not locked up. Oh well, that was almost 5 years ago, and now my tools are better than before and didn't cost but about $500 to replace what I had initially spent a couple grand on. I went with older better built tools rather than a lot of the crap they make for guys that just do it for fun. 
---
Your initial post implies you'd not been able to successfully remove it, not that you'd not gotten around to it. 
---
Not the guy you replied to but I'm 167 and also playing since beta. 
---
I'm on PFC and have encountered *all* the bugs.
---
Cards start at 10%, max at 20%. Takes 3 cards to get 20%, takes 1 of each to get 30%.
---
PS4. I'll edit the title.
---
yes. doesn't help with staggering though.
---
How is it moreso?
---
Yeah, I agree, nuke nerfs are a horrible way to provide balance.
---
My friends are all ranged characters and the nerf hit them like a ton of bricks.
---
I had a TSE alt I wasn't playing on (he's literally got normal armor pieces on, I haven't bothered to grind a legendary set for him yet....lol), that's no longer a thing.  My melee main is my only viable character left.
---
I really don't care how much people power level, I'll get there eventually.  But making the game a more painful grind for EVERYONE is not the way to go.......lol
---
p.s.  I hope you're not buying serums from the vendors.  4,000 caps is a waste.  Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  Top price you should pay there is 750 caps a serum.  Sometimes people give them away for free if you provide mats.  Also you can sell your legendary items for a lot more caps to "real players" than selling it for pitiful caps to the vendor bots.
---
Hope that helps man :)
---
I would be super pumped for an AMA
---
Reminds me of the slave trade.
---
I can confirm. Since the patch, my sneak skills became the worst. I killed a mole rat in a dark mine like 30m away. Next thing i know is a mole rat jumpscaring me in the face. I have max sneak, escape artist and was hidden until i hit it.
---
Now my favorite Fallout build is bigged yey. Another reason to focus on my Wasteland Photographer playstyle. That i atleast enjoy. 
---
Its a One S... so what Im experiencing is NOT a disconnected from server issue. Im performing an action when the screen freezes and the audio gets stuck on this high pitched “iiinnnngggggggggggg” sound. At that point, it will either unload the app, OR I have to quit.
---
This has not happened for a while, until the 29’s patch it began again.
---
I gave up and just wired the outside of my house. Ain't no one got time for that...
---
You must be pretty bored.
---
Yeah I'm not preordering it and tbh I'm pretty skeptical as I bought division 1 at release and i was not impressed.  But from what I hear they really fixed a lot of problems and hopefully they know what they're doing for #2.
---
I've had it pop up on PS4 the last few days each time I entered power armor. Thankfully I don't use PA often, or it would be much more of an annoyance.
---
I liked it until I couldn't play due to Tuesday's update. Sorry
---
Thanks for your reports about this. We're investigating!
---
I mentioned barrel length in the first part of the second paragraph but didn't expound too much on it. You're absolutely right!
---
I can craft those two for you, but I paid a lot for the plans so 200 each is as low as I'll go. I am available after 4pm est today if want to do the trade.
---
I had a switch inside I couldn't live without. Otherwise #metoo
---
Oh yeah they fixed everything and the game ended up in an amazing state. But it took them like 2 years 
---
Please fix the sneak bug. Some players are reporting going into a state of caution or danger even when far away. I’ll link the thread but it’s on the frontpage of the sub. 
---
I'm level 193.  Instigating is not the only effect. It's a 3 star.  And it's not the 'best drop' I've had. It's the weapon I use the most. I have weapons that are far more powerful but they break way faster. I have a two- shot explosive minigun, but it breaks very fast and eats ammo fastr and simply isn't necessary when dealing with run-of-the- mill enemies.  It's simply not needed when dealing with level 68  super mutants or level 50 glowing ghouls.  
---
&gt; LOL. This is how Fallout works, you get better weapons as you progress. 
---
No, that isn't how it works.   The nature of RNG is that you can have 193 levels of shit weapons drops.  Or you can get a fantastic drop at level 20. 
---
The idea that the longer you play, the better gear you get is total bullshit. 
---
I was telling him that if he got the first card for shotgunner, expert shotgunner and master shotgunner that it would add up to 30% damage increase from 3 pts invested instead of 20% dmg increase with 3pts invested in just one of them
---
This sub has 171,000 like you said, now there is no way to know for sure but I would reckon that this game does not have a playerbase over 1 million thus making this sub at least 17% of the population not the minut(e), small, amount you make it out to be. Also who knows better for what is good for the game than the people that are in the high 100s and 200s who have the most experience
---
Happy trails friend!
---
I'm envisioning a Girl Talk mashup of "Heads Will Roll" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and "Like a Rolling Stone" by Bob Dylan.
---
We appreciate all of this feedback, so thank you. We're looking to consider all suggested additions to the list, but we currently want the list to reflect the top concerns we've seen expressed.
---
It's not because of duping, fyi. Maybe for some, but not for all vendors. I have learned all mutation recipes through trading and scorched beast events and sell serums quite often. I'd hook you up right now if xbox live wasn't mostly down. :/
---
A threshold yes. Otherwise some dick could just damage all your camp items to low health and let NPCs fuck your camp without punishment.
---
I'm convinced people still playing have battered person syndrome.
---
I didn't do the bos quest and I can buy the plan from a vendor. I'm 81lvl for reference.
---
Same with wild corn and razor grain
---
How about dropping it below a threshold or a fixed damage amount? I could see some troll dropping someones camp down to low health on every item then leaving.
---
This post i full of useless speculation and dumb assumptions.
---
" Seven HUNDRED and sixty hours into a game that launched 79 days ago. I shouldn't have to point out everything wrong with that. "
---
Tell me what is wrong with this, from  [Glorf12](https://www.reddit.com/user/Glorf12)  burried in the comments: " Ive  been off work with an arm injury since August. Before 76 I heavily  played WoW. Im talking artifact power level 30 2 months ahead of anyone  else. Its all I could play really.
---
Im at  760 hours in 76. Its all I've played since its launch. I get a full  time weekly wage still and do physio daily. I just don't really have  much of a life other than work, gaming and my dogs."
---
i'm lvl 90.
---
I had to stop using regular armor, game forced me to run excursively excavator PA. My armor and guns kept breaking or running out of ammo. so game became a chore about constantly having to scavenge items to be able to repair (balistic fiber) and craft more ammo. game became boring and stale. all i could was run chores to be able to sustain myself. a day i could spend a bit more time online, i ventured into a nuke zone. apparently people managed to get the SBQ, i helped how i could with the hopes of what i was "investing" could nail me some cool stuff. it didn't. back to doing chores to try and recover what i had "invested". thats what the game became for me. spending my limited gaming time doing chores and thinking about if it was worth it "investing" time and "materials".
---
had high hopes for this patch, but they made the game worse even worse. some aspects are broken, their attempts at stopping dupers were for nothing since they just re introduced the bug that allowed that to happen again. and apparently people who craft a lot on things are being banned because that's how dupping happens. won't even try to collect my corn crops and make some soup.
---
but by all means keep telling members of this sub that we don't matter, we are all try hards and wannabe elite players and that we deserve to be ignored because the game is not tailored for us.
---
C’mon, man.  Fallout 76 is waaay better than Tactics or BOS.    
---
Bullshit. There are plenty of games that launched in a far worse state and bounced back. No Man's Sky, SimCity, Batman ports to PC, WoW, Diablo 3, Anthem's recent Beta (TBD), GTA 5. And all of those games had their problems, and got better. 
---
Pvp
---
I dont quest. 
---
I farm gear and kill ppl
---
So prior to Bethesda stating duping was cheating you thought duping wasn't an exploit?
---
Why is the real WV so quick to endorse a game where automation was taking jobs and every company is evil?
---
So when you said 'any weapon' you only meant your 50cal TSE?
---
Even my explosive Shotgun do it faster than that, without shotgun or explosive perks.
---
Grinding atoms in this game is literally work. The only difference is at your real job you probably make more than $0.10 per hour.
---
Question, isn’t Power Armor supposed to add to your carry weight. Obviously nothing near what the excavator does.  
---
So I usually have 280 carry weight out of my PA, when I jump in my x01, or ultracite, I get a 10lbs drop to 270?? The only Armor that adds is the carry weight is excavator. Is this a perk screwing with it?
---
Fun? I'll settle for playable first. I set this game down for weeks now since we have til March, at least, for new content. Too many other games I have the option to play that are solid, if not amazing games. I still have Spider Man, GoW, RDR2, oh and I haven't touched my switch since NYE 2017. Ya, playing those first before even logging in to vendor and only launch a nuke to kill SBQ.
---
The caution is to warn you that Bethesda is watching you, you filthy duper. Only Dupers use stealth. Be more American and just go guns a blazing
---
/s. 
---
Atom store is &lt;1% of the problem with Fallout.  It's useless cosmetics.  I have 4700 something points I haven't spent.
---
"oh everyone is uninstalling? better start cutting support"
---
this is the reality of how a business would see this situation, if everyone was jumping off the new games horrific reputation and launch and after losing so much investment, they'd see it as a blessing not needing to keep paying to try recoup their further losses for trying to sustain the game.
---
What new content? 
---
You can run power lines through walls too. I did to my brick cliff side chateau.
---
Honestly dude you and I are on the same page here I think. 
---
You basically put into words how I feel about the relationship of the subreddits to this game
---
You're right, I guess I overlooked that more people will want to vent frustrations amongst the community.
---
In *slight* defense of the sub there is a stickied post put up reminding that the spirit of the sub is to have fun and not bad other subs/people because complaints are legitimate.
---
That said, I think this sub is still streets ahead of the regular fallout sub. I think criticism and feedback on the game is valid and warranted but the endless self pity posts on a game gets tiring
---
I know this has been mentioned a lot, but I feel that it is worth mentioning again- as it tends to be crucial to a lot of players' style of gameplay (including me)- but stealth needs to be fixed, as it is too easy to get spotted and go into caution and danger mode whilst sneaking even with maxed agility and the related perks...  (even from afar and out of sight, where technically it should be hard to get spotted).
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.
---
You'll find plenty of people selling serums there.
---
You can also find legendary weapons, armor, materials, aid..........everything.
---
Plus it's fun trading with "real players".  You'll get a lot more caps for your legendary items than the pitiful ones the vendor bots dish out.
---
"Players don't let players trade with vendor bots" :)
---
There's a problem with xbox sign-in. [https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status)
---
No worries i typically donate to the lowbies but I like having extra Incase, I need to chemup. They always seem to make me thirsty.
---
What are you gonna add to your camp if you scrap a purifier and generators? Lolz
---
Vad, what platform are you on?
---
This has upvotes because r/fo76filthycasuals brigaded.
---
It's proportionate.  A restaurant does not promise to support your meal for hours after you have eaten it, where Bethesda has promised to support this game for years to come but this is the quality of support we have gotten thus far. 
---
I could re-write the analogy with a car dealership and buying a new car: the check engine light coming on, tire pressure light coming on, etc. and it would be the same and perhaps would be more palatable to you. But the end point is the same.  
---
Yeah, my parents used to tell me "It's just a game" but they also used to tell me:
---
* Maintain your integrity
---
* Be honest and direct
---
* Learn from your mistakes
---
Why should I be held to "It's just a game" when Bethesda is not being held to the other three? 
---
That's been my feeling. Even if the game doesn't take off the engine's gotten a lot of good attention out of it. Parts that they may have been afraid to touch in the past have been torn apart and refactored or rebuilt. And they now have a bunch of new developers who know the inner workings of the engine.
---
How many of their fixes and improvements make it back into the single player engine will probably depend a lot on Bethesda's internal culture, whether they're sharing code between projects or just treating it like its own thing and taking nothing back.
---
Say it ain't so! I need to check this tonight.
---
Even if I put 9 points in Rifleman it's like 160 max, for a 2-shot semi-automatic rifle. Surely your gatling shouldn't be that high?
---
In regards to displaying items, many people want clutter and misc objects to place on dressers, tables and shelves. As of now, it's pointless to place these cases if they're going to be empty. Maybe clusters of things like:
---
- Junk materials and scrap
---
- Foodstuffs
---
- Weapons and Ammo
---
- trinkets and souvenirs
---
- Armor pieces and helmets
---
- kitchen wares and tools
---
- more wall decor such as signs, fuse boxes, pipes, valves, etc
---
- working radios (please, we had them in BETA)
---
- Taxidermy heads of creatures killed
---
Those are just some suggestions, but basically little things that we could use to spice up our CAMPs. Many of the Atom shop items offered aren't "Fallout-esq". We want ramshackled items, decor and building kits. We don't need princess beds and racecar beds, we want salvaged decor and jurry-rigged items to make it feel like we're actually rebuilding from the ashes of the Atomic war. 
---
As for becoming wanted from hitting another players camp, please give us a few warnings. Sometimes when you're swarmed by enemies, just one accidental hit will give you a wanted level and it is a pain I'm the ass to get ride of. 
---
Also another thing people really want are better skins for weapons and armor. Please add just simple color pallets for all weapons. Sometimes we don't want "woodland camo," "vault tec," or "splatter paint" skins. Some of us just want a simple black, red, blue, chrome, etc skins for the weapons And armor we have. 
---
You must be really nice in real life with a bunch of friends! /s
---
No I bet everyone hates you and you live in your mother's basement. You cunt.
---
First id like to say that the game breaking damage issue of lasers  and the lackluster damage of anything propelled  but bullet based weapons is the first plop in the shitting of my cheerios.  I am not a fan of melee. Fo76 is the first game i used it as a crutch. Bullets are too weak and after i shot the 500-2k bullets i harvested over 2-3 days and then expended in 2 minutes flat i had no choice.  In melee spec i was able to save 2k+ bullets for a couple of guns with no effort on my part over a week. Just to lose it all  in one of many failed OP broodmother fights. A few cycles of that and you didn't have to worry about me taking advantage of it anymore.  It gave me a new perspective on conan exiles. 
---
Thats still strange to me to be completely honest, I've read it a couple of times, but it still strikes me as such a strange designe choice, I dont know tho, im not a game developer or know if theres any better alternatives out there.
---
500 for both , I have them crafted and ready Xbox here 
---
Considering that you are here.  I'll post another suggestion that's been discussed in here regarding user vending. 
---
The idea being having a vending machine.  Which is not new.  But the vending machine spawning inside of Whitesprings. 
---
Whitesprings is all ready a hub of user activity, with vendors, stash, and workstations.  It would be great if one lobby could be filled with user vending machines.  This way you have pre-defined spots for them.  So as people log into the server their vending machine is automatically added.  
---
You could also make these somewhat "magical" or "cloud" vending machines.  You build/place one in your camp and it then automatically spawns one in Whitesprings.  Also you could but inventory into your vending machine in your camp, and it would update the inventory at whitesprings.  
---
I hope that makes sense. 
---
This has happened to me too and not just in this game, i am level 150 at this point and don't experience the same problems others have had. This also happened with one of the best rpgs ever made in the form of Kingdom Come Deliverance, when it first came out it was hella buggy but I did not experience maybe even half the amount of bugs others experienced.
---
To me it doesn't sound like you're grinding. 
---
The players complaining are grinding. They are on 6-10hrs per day and play a lot more than what you have logged. Like 4 times as much. They tend to find bugs and snags and run into issues more frequently as they farm and grind and farm and grind and they'll do it 1000 times, but then one time out of the 1000, the enemy that respawned a third time in the same place they had killed the previous two will bug and heal to full health or partial health. Etc. 
---
These are a small number of the 1.4 million estimated players, like probably a couple hundred or maybe even a thousand people out of that 1.4 million. And then they post on here and get the popular opinion and they get an upvote because somebody at one point in time had that happened to them once or twice one day out of the week and all of a sudden it's the worst issue ever and it always happens and never is fixed. You see where this is going right? Lol
---
I’ve never see:
---
- a gun that shoots .556
---
- anything with TSE 
---
- a full set of power armor (I’m missing an arm)
---
- a scope that isn’t a worthless black crosshair 
---
- a pet of any sort
---
I’m level 26
---
Yes, because that is their job
---
Honestly? That’s so fucking stupid. I can completely understand nerfing the explosive towards the TSE guns but O didn’t realized they nerfed ALL explosive damage.
---
“This game has been out for 2.5 months and people act like it has been years. the game is still a baby.”
---
Have you ever heard of sudden infant death syndrome? Some of us are trying to prevent that for the longevity of the game by hammering Bethesda.
---
Not if your game is about making your build and character how you want. That’s how Elder Scrolls and Fallout became popular.
---
Now it’s play this way or else and be punished.
---
Yeah, 10 minutes per week play time?
---
I feel like you're ignoring the engagement system. If a ranged player wants to PvP a melee player, it's all slap until the melee player is in their face smiting them with a super sledge. Range doesn't really help balance things out when they have to close the distance before real damage can be done at all.
---
OOOOOOOF
---
A Korean MMO dev isnt a AAA dev
---
So that's where Bethesda put all the NPCs
---
A fix is needed for the wild mongrel horde event.  The last 7 of them I have done I was fighting what is best described as dilapidated stick  figures.  The enemy models  were a mess and if I did  not have an explosive weapon, I could not have killed them.
---
No to putting a scope on a revolver.  Dumbest thing I’ve seen next to fatmen being outclassed by bullets.

Why farm when you can sell your excess legendary pieces to other players?  Then take those caps and buy all the lead and plastic you could ever need?  Sell a legendary for 1,000 caps, then use those caps to buy 300 steel, 300 lead, and 300 plastic.
---
Plus players sell ammo there all the time.
---
The worst price you should pay is 2 ammo for 1 cap.  Average is 3-4 ammo for 1 cap.  Sometimes you can find even better deals than that!
---
"Friends don't let friends server hop and farm until they're frustrated"
---
Youve clearly never worked retail lol
---
Watching this right now. 15 Agility, 3 Sneak, silenced weapons, cloaking armor, Chameleon armor.... Enemies will detect immediately, even without line of sight. 
---
Yup, I caught it man. Smart move too. 
---
Its incredible how they're nerfing this comment in favor of one with less upvotes but positive to them.
---
300+ hours on PS4, game works fine for me (most days).
---
Totally Agree, and for all of those commenting on how impossible it is to get TSE weapons, believe me or not, (at 58 years old, I Don't Care!) I'm somewhere between Casual &amp; Hardcore, leaning to the latter.
---
I have personally gotten 6 TSE Drops from this Game, and several more TS, or Exp., I currently have 7, Some that I looted, a couple that I traded for, and one that was gifted to me at around level 60 from a level 300+ player, that first checked me out with an Alt character to make sure I wasn't a Duper.
---
I have not paid any inflated prices for anything in this game, and wouldn't, I believe my highest purchase was a Stealthboy Mod for my T60 for 1500 caps, I am currently at level 110+ and feel completely insulted by the Nerfs that have left all my primary weapons nearly useless, I can craft a Handmade Rifle that is only 9 Dam points below my TSE Handmade.
---
I got my first "kick to fix" on Monday night.
---
I had my first "player who doesn't understand I'm a pacifist" follow me around the map yesterday. 
---
Maybe actually destroying a CAMP object should cause wanted + bounty.
---
Accidentally popping off a shot or hitting a wall while defending a friend's CAMP though deserves some forgiveness.
---
Yesterday on PS4, we beat her down in 2min. She didny regenerate, and my power attack bloodied grognak's was taking 1/5th of her health off
---
Even in this example, though, with Herculean effort to make pistols viable, the problem is that there's a vastly superior option with a VATS build, that being a rifle. The lessened use of AP in VATS just doesn't make up for the increased ammo usage and increased time to kill.
---
Thank you for your input.  
---
Sorry, dont think I can really explain it at a lower level. Sorry you're not following it.
---
The friendly supermutant
---
Seems like the Vendor Plan update juggled around a lot of stuff.  Unfortunate for me.  Though I'm pretty sure I'm ready to finish the Belly of the Beast mission.  Just have to convince my teammates to come along.
---
Buy an external hard drive
---
I always find some inside Morgantown High School. From the main entrance, head right down the small staircase and there should be a table at the base of those stairs which should have two skeletons on it with 3 plastic pumpkins or so, with the bubblegum in the middle. 
---
I have some other places where to find it but I'll have to confirm those places later (^^High school is usually my go to for bubblegum)
---
It most certainly is that high.  And a fully modded Gatling with zero legendary effects does that exact same damage. 
---
And perhaps you didn’t need to replace certain things that you really didn’t use much. The one thing I love about moving, the culling of the crap beforehand!
---
Why not?
---
Just get a Super Sledge. Problem solved.
---
I want this *so* damn bad. Any kind of system that allows us to essentially craft our own personal god tier items would be awesome.
---
I would thoroughly enjoy grinding thay grind. The end goal is totally attainable, but would still take a long time. I wouldn't be able to put the game down.
---
Someone else said something like an AMA would be beneficial, I agree with that, with some additional input...I'd like to see one of the devs do an actual Q&amp;A here.  Give us a post and a few days to make/upvote questions and then let someone answer questions who can give more feedback than "I'll let them know" or "we'll look into why they made these changes".  
---
As a casual player, it's really frustrating to log into the game, spend the first 30-45 minutes of your 2 hour playtime doing maintenance on your weapons/armor/ammo/base before you're able to do anything in the game.  The really limited carry capacity combined w/ the really absurdly heavy weapon weights make for actually leaving your camp for extended periods of time annoying.  
---
Getting some dev insight into why they keep making changes that, from an outside perspective, seem to be being made in order to make the "grind" heavier and more punishing.  Maybe that's not the case, but it certainly feels that way from the outside looking in and without any word on why you guys are making changes, that's all we really have.
---
I'll sell you a adrenaline reaction recipe for 9k 
---
Well, I guess I'll check back in a couple of weeks then, this is BS
---
Can't see them ever balancing for proper diversified gun play...However bring on the hate the TSE 200% to 50% was for the better, and brings more diversified game play and weapon choices.  one shot one kill is fun for no one for more than.. 20 minutes.
---
TSE is no longer mandatory to play at an efficient high level.  Now they need to balance every other gun (including energy and pistols) to make it fun for all builds, course that's a tough chore.
---
For that matter, selling ammo would be amazing. I have like a thousand .38's 
---
lulz no. 2 entirely different types of gameplay/gamefeel. 
---
Okay why is it not worthless? It's being given away for free. 
---
That got boring a hundred levels ago
---
1) Xbox One

2) snazzylamps

3) N/A

4) Played last night for a few hours, I was CONSISTENTLY underweight (by 20-30 lbs) but I had the overencumbered symbol in the bottom right corner and was told I couldn't fast travel because I was overencumbered? I could still run, but not fast travel despite being underweight. Super frustrating.
---
Ouch.  He looks like he just got excavated 
---
Dammit now that you brought it up Bethesda will be nerfing every other gun and gun related perk to be on par with pistols!
---
Nah, chief ....sorry 
---
Can you please acknowledge that the Stealth Boy Mark iii does not work at all and that there are plans to fix it in the future? Would really appreciate just knowing you are passing that on to the team.
---
When will there be a fix for the bug that causes you to take damage from enemies from outside a structure while inside after loading into its interior?  The game thinks you are outside but you are inside....
---
Because i paid 4 figures for a graphics card
---
Was just thinking this morning about the issues with pistols.They should give them a 20% damage increase. I used the small guns bobblehead and noticed an immediate difference in usefulness. Otherwise there is just little point in any sort of build for them. 
---
Can we have bulking items actually reduce weights(like lead and aluminum) and perhaps even multiple tiers of bulking for compound storage. This would keep the number of items the server has to keep track of down more, and allow us to hold onto everything.
---
I personally enjoy fallout games the most for being able to pick up absolutely everything in the world, and I feel I'm not alone in that. This feels like a solution that works for the both of us.
---
This is an issue for you? Lol pathetic. 
---
Does the 45 health perk help?
---
&gt;Yeah reverse the rad rage build which btw means removing the rads
---
you need low health for bloodied and adrenal reaction. it works with ranged as well. just saying.
---
&gt;but it is affected by perception and luck which is where the unyielding armor comes in.
---
no ranged crit will deal 17k willy nilly. and melee can crit as well. with 40%+ swing speed, it hits faster than most non-auto weapons as well.
---
I guess you wouldn't know since you just oneshoot stuff all the time. you know, being melee and all.
---
&gt;Amazing how you can not only keep distance between you and your target you can pop crits like crazy
---
you keep bringing up the imaginary gap. read my post: a good melee player doesn't care about the gap. and I say imaginary because with latency and vats, it's a lot shorter than it seems to be. take a step back and ask yourself, if the """gap""" is such an issue for you, are you really as good as you paint yourself to be?
---
&gt;as I sit back with a two shot fat man that nails 1200 damage without perks.
---
the (supposedly) strongest ***single shot weapon*** in the game can break 1k? you don't say! still short 15.8k of a half-assed melee build, though. but that's okay, because of muh distance.
---
its a joke no ? 
---
Things were running smoothly for me when the game was working, but I had 3 "infinite loading screen" issues in the span of 4 hours. It makes me incredibly reluctant to claim a workshop.
---
Because it matches Wikipedia.  Because people massively overblow the unreliability of Wikipedia.
---
No need of pistols in a FPS...
---
Needs better variety first, and absolutely foremost.  Not counting modular energy weapons like lasers, or plasma, all handgun users have is:
---
A .38 pipe pistol peashooter
---
A 10mm still-kinda peashooter
---
A .45 single-action pipe revolver...
---
A .44 single-action revolver ( ".44 pistol")
---
...Another  .44 single-action revolver with fewer mods (Western Revolver)
---
And yet another .44 single-action revolver that must be reloaded round-by-round rather than by speedloader like the others.
---
There are 4 revolver pistols that are functionally almost exactly the same.  This is absolutely damning for variety for handguns. Where is the more-powerful middle-ground semi-automatic? A .45 auto-pistol would fill in an absent category here.
---
Where are the harder hitting power-pistols?  Or  actual double-action revolvers instead of just single-action? .44 can be viablee specialized properly, sure, but this game can totally fit in 5-shot 45-70 hunting revolvers, or some sort of  12.7mm handcannon. Heck, even something that uses 5.56 would be appreciated.
---
No other weapon crafting in the game works like that though. Once you have the plans you can craft whatever you want as long as you have the raw resources.
---
Nah.  I’ve eaten fat mans, orbital strikes, artillery, explosive shotguns, and Bloodied melee claws, but not nukes.
---
Wait so the new Far Cry is gonna be like Minecraft, too? Why is every game turning into Minecraft? Awful idea haha
---
Yeah... I mostly stay in the lucky hole mine now. Perform satanic rituals, convert new cultists or sacrifice them to cthulu.. slaughter mole miners and responders. The usual sort. 
---
Sounds like a good idea time to go back to Fo4, Skyrim and Kingdom Come Deliverance, truly great RPGs
---
You think very highly of yourself, don't you? 
---
Not an issue, I had no idea it worked for anything!
---
They should add Weapon Jamming with low weapon conditions . Also, Explosive (explosive * effect) weapons having A Slight chance of Blowing up in the weapon itself.
---
My bad, I meant "Luck of the Draw", I run level 3 and have previously gone more than a week (40+ hours) without needing to repair. 
---
I doubt that
---
It still happens. Happened to me yesterday, had to dismantle a ton of duplicates. 
---
It's like you've stuffed your entire head up your ass and are telling us how beautiful the sky looks. The overwhelming display of gross incompetence with this game is blindingly clear. The fact that you can look at this ridiculous release and say with a straight face that they're doing a great job is baffling. At no point in the past 3 months have Bethesda made a good quality decision or change. The fact that this game performs worse than an indie game made by 5 people is absolutely unacceptable.
---
This game is broken.
---
This game is poorly developed.
---
This game is bullshit.  
---
Giving this disaster of a title a pass because you enjoy it is insane. You're allowed to like the game, just as someone can like a terrible movie, but no one looks at The Room and says "they did a great job."
---
You're blind
---
Have you been infected with Rad Worms yet?
---
Perhaps you’d like to articulate exactly how they differ in your mind?
---
And (let me preface this by saying that I genuinely, really and truly mention this not to be a wanker, only to indicate that my comment isn’t some triggered brain flare from a basement dweller with cheezel-dust coated fingers, surrounded by dead Pepsi cans and hours deep into my seventh all night gaming session in a row) - but I have a combined masters degree in Classics and English Literature, so over the years I’ve actually given this whole topic a lot of thought.
---
Games are a new art form and they’re getting more and more sophisticated all the time.
---
Think of the art forms we put on pedestals - literature, music, artwork, theatre, film - games are a combination of all of them.
---
They have narrative structure, (some) have the same amount of blood, sweat and tears poured into them as classical masterpieces and - magically - they’re immersive. 
---
I mean, I fucking love books. There was a time when I was reading as much per week as u/Glorf12 is currently gaming because it was required of me, and because I enjoy it. And they’re immersive too, but in a passive way. 
---
Which is good - it’s great that you have to watch Heathcliffe and Kathy fuck up repeatedly, without even being able to bitchslap either of them, much as you want to, because it makes you think and feel and experience things you might otherwise not have thought or felt.
---
But sometimes it’s nice to be in the driver’s seat and I’d argue it’s just as enlightening, just as useful, though in a different way, as reading a book.
---
I had a VR experience last year that was so thought-provoking and beautiful it nearly reduced me to tears.
---
Life is Strange affected me deeply, made me re-examine my views on a lot of things and was cathartic because it came out around the time I was dealing with the murder of a friend who’d died in circumstances not unlike those in the game.
---
Fallout is thematically dense and has given me an insight into the fear of nuclear fallout that dominated the minds of people in the 50s. And then when I’m getting too maudlin, a Mr Handy appears with the pack of mutant hounds he’s fallen in love with and pistol packin’ mama comes on the radio. Awesome stuff.
---
Just about every new art form has been maligned as a waste of time at its inception.
---
In Shakespeare’s time, plays were considered low, bawdy entertainment for the masses. Of course, everyone found them entertaining, but the upper classes indulged guiltily and wouldn’t be caught dead in an actual playhouse.
---
In Austen’s time, novels - including hers - were considered time-wasters and a guilty pleasure for women, whose weak lady-brains were too inclined to seek fiction, as opposed to “worthier” books like philosophy, natural history etc. They were also considered morally sketchy by the Christian church since they portrayed “lies” rather than truth.
---
Films were considered technologically impressive and artistically bankrupt when they first hit the screens.
---
Mark my words, a few hundred years from now, someone with a masters in philosophy and classic gaming will be arguing with someone else about the worthiness of whatever new art form they’re consuming - probably something involving lasers, rocket sneakers and taste-bud stimulating technology - and saying that, believe it or not, when games came out they were considered a guilty pleasure for men who didn’t have anything better to do with their time and who were too intellectually lazy to tackle “worthier” art forms. 
---
Anyway I’m interested to hear your thoughts because I always find it odd when people who game (and I’m assuming you do, since you’re in this sub) consider it entertaining but unworthy. Do you feel a bit guilty every time you pick up a controller? 
---
Like, I get balance and why someone might be confronted by someone spending massive amounts of time gaming. 
---
But we all hit weird periods in our lives where, for whatever reason, one thing dominates our time more than anything else. As long as we’re enjoying it and getting something out of it - isn’t that what matters?  
---
I have been toying around with a critical sneak attack full auto pistol build. Outside of sneak bonuses, it is terrible. I think I am at 52 damage per shot with 7 of 9 related pistol damage perks. However, the burst damage from a 2.5x sneak critical headshot with all the critical bonus perks and mutation is killing many enemies faster than my main rifle build. Two headshots on level 68 ghouls kills them. The biggest thing pistols have going for them is low VATS cost. I get over 12 shots off in VATS before I am out of AP. 12 critical sneak headshots with the damage ramp from either furious prefix or concentrated fire is pretty powerful. The biggest issue I have is sustained damage against large targets like SBQ or a mirelurk queen.
---
A word on concentrated fire, you know those assault bots with the fusion cores in their backs you cannot shoot until they overheat? With concentrated fire, you can turn a 0% chance to hit into a 100% chance to hit by simply throwing out a couple missed shots first. Once it ramps accuracy up high enough, it kills them instantly.
---
I think full auto pistols are ok. Single shot, I am not so sure.
---
When will schorched heads be fixed so that they do not freeze in place after being killed?
---
I was thinking it just depends on the leaders charisma, the followers could all be scrubs
---
Railway Rifles were so much in Fo4. Can you still nail bodyparts bc it wasnt working for me last time. Thats why i sold it. Was a ghouls slayer. 
---
Mini robot models we find at Robco please!!!
---
Wrong, I had an *opinion* on it, just like you do.  Turns out Bethesda shared that opinion, though, seemingly unlike yours, and that makes all the difference.
---
How many ppl though?
---
According to reddit once you get 10 ppl its impossible pre patch let alone post patch.
---
I was shocked that less than a 1/4 of the ppl in my run were melee.  And there was a large amount of ppl.
---
I read the first and last sentence.
---
I think I'm infected with rad worms about 90% of the time.
---
TSE nerf ALONE doesn't bring more diversified game play and weapon choices. It's a critical component to be sure, but other weapon buffs are still necessary. Nerfing TSE does nothing for weapons like pistols that were never being picked by anyone in the first place because even the choices below TSE were still objectively superior.
---
I got my PA skins through atom store and grinding. 
---
They got $60 off me, and my initial impression wasn’t great after all the duping and instability, I wasn’t gonna throw any more money into their store.
---
If it helps you can view the store as
---
1) a free customization tool if you’re willing to grind.
---
2) a more expedient way to customize if you’re willing to pay.
---
Engagement system is only relevant for the first kill. Pvp is a long back and forth of many kills/revenge. It doesnt exist at workshops either bro. Engagement starts when i tag your bench. Otherwise im usually wanted so i dont get the first shot anyway.
---
I hate the SLAP system. They should get rid of it. Its lame. Its a security blanket for the coddled fallout fanboys. This game isnt for them. 
---
Lol na man ubi games aren't very good. Far Cry 5 isnt even as good as 76. 
---
They should just make completion independent of the event goals. If you join, you get the rewards. Fixed!
---
Since the TSEs got nerfed, my build kinda sucks now.  It would take so much XP to respec.  I'm not sure I want to bother.
---
I was thinking, though.  How annoying (or fun) would it be to play a super squishy build where you expect to die constantly?  Death is not a big consequence in this game anyway.  You only lose your junk.  But I already have my camp built pretty much the way I want it.  I only need junk for armor repairs and weapon repairs.  If I forgo armor, I don't need it for armor repairs at all.  I can survive pretty easily scavenging low-level areas for junk when it's time to repair a weapon.  
---
The idea of making my way through the Cranberry Bog with zero armor or stimpaks and dying 1,000 times along the way kind of amuses me.
---
Bethesda: “ We nerfed the fat man from the previous fallouts because we felt like they were over preforming. Over performing in the sense of pride and enjoyment you got for blowing the shit out of anything.”
---
Fans: “...”
---
Attach to 3 star ranged weapons to make them 4 star, adding bonus damage to scorched and minus damage to everything else. Useful for scorched beast queen and daily scorched fighting.
---
Caps
---
Fallout always had a carry weight. Sell the stuff you don't need and store the most important things. You don't need all that stuffs.
---
Also invest in Strength and in weight perks. And add pockets to your armor. I don't see the big deal with carry weight.
---
We had 9 camped out waiting for the nuke, and 3 who jumped in a little late! Most were melee, and some still used TSE's for adds!
---
I'm not really interested in your point if you are going to act like mine is nothing. We disagree, further discussion, like I suspected is pointless. Enjoy your travels Wastelander. 
---
Oh fuck that’s what it was doing 
---
I’m a fucking monster 😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
On Tuesday I literally couldn't play. Am I allowed to be upset by that?
---
Plastic nuka dark rum bottles burn pretty good.......I hear
---
The crosshairs on PC using 21:9 resolution got inverted earlier this week with the big patch. When you aim at something the crosshairs get big (almost the full height of the screen) making it hard to aim when not using sights/scopes.
---
Maybe lane or that might be lane
---
The point was so that people playing the game could actually talk about the game and not be flooded with hate threads, but it has kinda turned into lets bash /r/fo76
---
Have you submitted the bug directly to Bethesda?
---
Oh nice.  
---
Really makes me question who is still failing her and why only on reddit its impossible.
---
Good thinking using that emote, wish we had a "Don't be greedy"-emote or something. One time i was lucky to have someone accept the challenge but it was sadly only one legendary left.
---
The idea that the longer you play the better the gear is absolutely true. Binomial distribution. The more rolls you have the greater your probability of successfully getting a good roll.  It's the same reason that a casino will comp a lucky player a free room.
---
Why don't you trade for a better Gatling gun? You do realize the instigating perk only works for the first bullet and if the target is full health?
---
Ok.....well if i buy a lamborghini i shoukdbt ve abke to bitch and moan all day because i cant drive it top speed on the freeway. 
---
Im not saying you did anything wrong. Just that im sure its expensive to tweak a game in for .00001% of players. 
---
Yeah, they're usually just over a hill or behind trees or something, there but reeeeeally far out.
---
 I think cyberpunk will be waaay better than 76. Dystopian and not wasteland... But still
---
&gt;I don't know what to say, man. grab a dictionary I guess? because the word "objective" does have context. it implies factual things. and opinions aren't factual.
---
Because people confuse facts with opinions all the time.  Lets look at your initial post ONE MORE TIME.
---
    the game is objectively not good and Bethesda is making questionable choices. you're gonna have to deal with people pointing that out.
---
you say "The game is objectively not good and Bethesda is making questionable choices."  The part where you add the "and Bethesda is making questionable choices" breaks it away from the statement of "The game is objectively not good."  The context his has two parts that you are presenting.
---
    1. The game is not good
---
AND
---
    2. Bethesda is making questionable choices.
---
The use of the word AND separates the "game is objectively not good" from "Bethesda is making questionable choices.  If you wanted to connect them in context, you would have said "the game is objectively not good BECAUSE Bethesda is making some questionable choices."  
---
Since the statement of "the game is objectively bad" cannot hold up in a vacuum, it is false.  Its not a metric that can objectively be measure, and more than I could say that "Peanut butter is objectively bad", then when called out I would reply with "well, I was talking about the allergic reactions it cause as bad.  Since I used objectively I was only talking about facts!"
---
You use of "objectively" has failed to hold up to scrutiny and you just keep digging in ... why?
---
affirmation of our concerns is always great.
---
hopefully the upward progress of these patches continue. regardless of how you feel about the nerfs, patch 5 re-ruined performance and stability for many. on top of that, it introduced old bugs, while introducing plenty of new ones. i'd go as far as to say this is the worst patch we've seen.
---
it's nice to hear some of these things *finally* being acknowledged. it could be argued that a number of these issues have been identified by the community since day zero, but better late than never.
---
what will really matter is the implementation. hopefully we don't have to wait too long for the next set of fixes...
---
I almost in the same boat as you - not much in the way of bugs or CTD (about the same as you mentioned). THe only thing I see on a more regular basis is the stretchy necks of dead Scorched.
---
But what about the *lore*
---
Glad to see someone finally getting some traction with this topic. There's definitely something going on with the vendor inventories in regards to plans. I made a part with my experiences last night:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alygb7/plan_availability_on_vendors_working_as_intended
---
I'll be sure to add my results here so we can maybe get a better idea of what's going on.
---
50 shades of fallout
---
Stealth broken in last patch. more and more posts popping up about it. Lvl 3 Sneak, Escape Artist and 24 agility with mutations/armour, Chameleon effects and still constantly in danger or caution status.
---
Then why are you getting downvoted?
---
weapons, even if its not weapons racks for my custom weapons id love to hang a nice rifle on the wall or over a fireplace (which wold also be awesome to have.
---
Yeah, I agree.
---
Did TSE need a triple nuke nerf into the dirt (two shot, explosive, AND the demo perk card), no.
---
It would be a lot better if they took on the League of Legends balance approach.  I wrote about it here:
---

---
Usually raider hideouts have a pretty good amount. 
---
It's everywhere in Toxic Valley but apart from 1 spot on the edge of The Mire I've not seen it anywhere else. Very easy to farm. But bloody annoying that it scraps to wood when you scrap all. I for one am glad they are aware and going to fix this. 
---
Saved data does not store your photos. Only game settings. Photos are stored on Beth servers, just like the characters.
---
same for rifles or no?
---
Also Random ammo gets taken out of inventory while picking up items  or quest items. Also getting this error as of now while game kept  freezing on me once in a while.  [3:0:8444249301319680]
---
Except the 50% bonus brings the damage to roughly the same as a hardened receiver. My lever action with hardened receiver is 270 damage.  Scorch killer drops that down to 184+50% so 276 v scorched and 148 vs everything else.
---
There is no reason to use the scorch killer mod.
---
This issue is on our radar, and we're currently investigating.
---
Could also be all the ppl that duped can no longer have 300000 weight on their person anymore and Beth is starting to purge their accounts
---
How about fixing it (Fallout 76) to support a 21:9 aspect ratio (not just a resolution) and not having everything stretched and/or zoomed in? Is that an engine limitation, dev ability limitation, or don't have the time/resources to start on that yet? I hope it is the latter. I am tired of using mods to fix this.
---
All live services for that matter as well 
---
The only other thing I would add is that there is a percentage of players that are not on any forums at all that still play the game. I would guess it's mainly older players (like me), but I would guess Fallout would attract more of those than a game that doesn't have as long a history. 
---
If you also consider the subscribers here that have duplicate accounts (I have no idea how may that is, but it's more than zero) and the ones that come here to post that have never purchased nor bought the game, it throws it off a bit more.
---
I, like many others, have been logging in less and less since there is less to do at my level. That said, I do have to agree with the OP in the sense that the player base a a whole is not at the same stages if those numbers are accurate. 
---
Maybe someday we;ll get legit number and not have to speculate so much. Even if it's the percentage of sales by platform. 
---
I feel like there is a longer *Known* list. 
---
I think some smart nerd needs to take a look at all of the positive posts since release and check for hired shills.
---
Is this only for January or is it all time
---
well...Bethesda put the development of FO76 onto their smaller newer studio (Bethesda Austin) that yet had to release their first game before they got the order for 76....and that studio is/was microtransaction and F2P-focused before...that could explain why the Atomshop works like a charm and we question multiple ingame dev choices like those you mentioned
---
I would love to wear a military cap or Army Helmet with these!
---
*J47. Last call for J47*
---
I mean there will be a better version of Creation Engine from all this, but it's still going to be creation engine. 
---
They're not rewriting the base of it which seems to be where people say the issues are. 
---
Hell yeah man. Let me know when and give me a link!
---
I like the Farcry series, I’ll probably get it and play it, like all the other ones, but it’s not the same game, and after a play through or two I’ll set it aside and that’ll be it. This game on the other hand has its hooks in me and will continue to see play as long as it’s supported.
---
Let me dial it back then... useful for the 4th star so nubes see a "4 star legendary" and pay way too many caps for it and make you rich?
---
I've had no problems so far.  Even dropped the queen 3 times last night with mostly ranged users.
---
I'm curious what kinds of gun builds ppl run as i had so many extra pts that i dumped into lck to be a vats monster.
---
Suggestion: Export Phots from Photo Mode to Other Apps/Devices
---
On Xbox to export a photo from photo mode requires you to take the photo, then take a screen shot of the photo, then go to the Xbox app on a phone to view and actually save the photo—or manually export it to OneDrive on the console. 
---
This is super clunky. I’d suggest adding the ability to link your email address or apps like Dropbox to automatically share photos you’ve taken to yourself.
---
Photo mode is awesome. I can take the 4K photos from an Xbox One X and edit them like actual photos. They look great, it’s lots of fun, but should be easier to get the photos to other devices. 
---
I have thought of this and looked into the anti Armor values, which have lead me to no concrete evidence that the “anti Armor” legendary affix gives 50% Armor penetration.   
---
  I would have thought the Somerset special would have an increased AA value with it being a unique variant. 
---
posting this separate from my opinions for visibility:
---
I experience a bug regularly that steals my ammo whenever I am harvesting certain resources. most commonly, I see it with ore. i will mine ore in my excavator armor, and in the same moment that it says "iron ore added," i get a message saying "removed x ___ rounds" (i.e. "removed 10 5.56 rounds"). this also happens when gathering nuked flora and other vegetables as well. has been around for a while.
---
My Xbox live services don’t work :/ you online ?!
---
Just server hop lol 
---
Shill or apologist?
---
Once you get to 25, make sure to go to ash heap to start the Excavator armor quest. Needs a lot of mats but it makes a world of difference. I'm like 58 and I never take it off.
---
Why not just run through whitesprings or any other high enemy count area, kill and loot, then break down the junk for what you need? 
---
same for rifles?
---
But I’ll lose the stuff I dropped ... I need that stuff haha
---
Re camp decor for me it's just clutter, being able to put stuff like plates down on tables, books on shelves, I want to be able to display one of those house tea pots. Also bathroom fittings that don't look so shabby, a kitchen counter, a fridge, wall shelves would be useful as well. 
---
That’s always been a silly thing in fallout games though, nothing new
---
Besides, it’ll get me a commendation towards the Enclave quest.
---
Basically CAMPS should have the slap damage mechanic too.
---
Hahaha, that got a genuine laugh.
---
/u/BethesdaGameStudios_

&gt; Display Items in C.A.M.P. as décor
---
&gt; STATUS: We are looking into this for a future update and welcome feedback on what specific items you’d like to be able to display.

* Virtually very junk item in the game. Just have a crafting option in build mode requiring said junk item (not the components, the actual item) and let us place it as a static object.
---
**Bear's Soap Box That Will Likely Fall On Deaf Ears**
---
***Weapon Balancing:*** Please address weapon balance across the board. In it's current state if someone want's to take on the role of a damage dealer in a party as of the last patch Melee is the only viable option. Current balance tuning is forcing players to build their characters specific ways. It seems the thought process on balance tuning is currently "This is overperforming, we must tone it down." when it should be "These are underperforming, we should prop them up." A character rocking a sword should be equally viable to a character rocking a super sledge, revolver, or mini-nuke. Your build needs to be a matter of what fit's your fun and play style and not some pigeon-hole meta of "this is best".
---
***Support:*** If you want to see people group up more and have more support builds I humbly suggest a stimpack barrel for the syringer.
---
***Loot Tables:*** Again a recommendation. If you are going to have legendary items that are specifically for PVP, have them only drop on the upcoming PVP server.
---
***Scorchbeasts:*** When future tuning is implemented for these please consider the risk vs. reward of encountering these enemies. These enemies as they currently are require a disproportionate amount of resource expenditure in comparison to the reward. ***Recommended fix:*** All scorch beasts be treated as legendary enemies and drop rewards as such. To avoid "farming" fissure sites a long cool down timer on their spawn would be recommended.
---
***The Queen:*** This event should be gated. As it stand a fresh out the vault level 2 can "participate" in this event resulting in increased event difficulty overall and unintended rewards to the fresh character. Proposed solution: Retune the even to have a requirement of some type to participate as well as take place in an instanced location only accessible to individuals on a team with a member that participated in the launch of the nuke to spawn the event.
---
***Whitesprings Farming:*** Some tuning has already taken place to make farming this area less lucrative. However, it still takes place and with it's central location on the map many high level players naturally congregate here. this causes an issue with players following quest lines to level where the enemies spawned in the area are disproportionately over leveled to them. **Proposed solution:** Impose a level cap on the area (30ish?)
---
***PVP:*** With the announcement of Survival Mode AKA dedicated PVP servers with leaderboards, it is time to make PVP a truly opt-out option on the Adventure server. While it is understood that for design and technical reasons you cannot make player camps immune to attack, players themselves should be able to opt out of PVP completely, both dealing and receiving damage. With a cooldown timer on opting in/out of course to prevent abuse. The game was marketed as a CO-OP Fallout experience with optional PVP. The recent focus on balancing around PVP is showing the game design is steering towards being more PVP-centric. Please remember a not-insignificant amount of your player base does not came to PVP or only wishes to do so casually.
---
I will step down off my soap box now and accept my downvotes.
---
It's been nerfed hard but still powerful.
---
Just FYI, they didn't "farm out" ESO. Their parent company, Zenimax, already owns their IPs. When Bethesda said they couldn't make a multiplayer elder scrolls, Zenimax said fine, we'll do it.
---
I mean I've seen bugs happen in videos and such but since beta day one for PC and for four weeks straight after it came live I've experienced ONE "bug" (that I wouldn't consider a bug but apparently some did). 
---
The only issue I had was from my own PC not the game. 
---
Yea i believe its the same with most the weapon dmg perks
---
Exit server.  You can exit the server even if you're in combat.
---
Log into another server.  The scorchbeast should be gone.
---
Or if you have horrible RNG luck, a different one should be there.......lol
---
Who are you to say what anyone should be relying on?
---
You can make sneak work for mob rushes, you just have to be careful about where you're sniping from, like a real sniper would. And that's the fun of role playing.
---
This, I was so disappointed when I wasn't able to use either with a gas mask.
---
I think that's the kicker of it. First thing we do after nuking ourselves? Nuke ourselves again.
---
And let's be honest, it's not just to fight the Scorched. People are nuking the ever-loving shit out of Appalachia in a bid for personal power at this point. Destroying entire ecosystems to capture strange and exotic materials that exist for only a glimmer of a moment. The total disregard of the close call humanity just suffered, like laughing your way through a second round of Russian Roulette after kicking the body of the last guy out of his seat.
---
And you know why humanity does that?
---
Because war never changes.
---
I've only played since Christmas and I have personally experienced *most* of the bugs people complain about. Middle of Jan I was averaging 5-6 CTDs a day.
---
This is all on a 1 year old XB1 S.
---
Load times for me have decreased by at least 50%, which is pretty great.
---
I can confirm that heavy combat plans are not level gated in this way. I have a level 75 character that had no HCA available for purchase at Watoga. When I changed characters, and servers, my level 49 found HCA torso plans on Watoga and other vendors.
---
Yeah, I know how to do it safely. I just heard a couple people getting ripped of. It's more of just quality of life. You can go " hey can you mod my handmade" to random players at a workbench and not have to coordinate. Or when people are in teams and they have to transfer stuff over to whoever has the mod. It can be tedious with components and such.
---
One other mod they should for the fat man is "Ultracite Warhead" that does bonus damage to Scorchbeasts and Scorched.
---
There's technically no need for anything other than melee and one rifle by that logic.
---
I need to grab the stuff I dropped though!
---
What the fuck does it melt? 
---
Count me in as part of the affected group... I can normally remain hidden from most trash mobs during a SBQ fight, but during my last run, it was like I had a flashing light on my head.  I had to jump on top of a fence (thanks, marsupial) to keep from being overrun, and they still seemed to flock to me.
---
When dropping by Harper's Ferry last night, even lower level (&lt; level 50) Super Mutants and Scorched had no problem spotting me, in stealth, on the rooftops.  I tried it with and without my chameleon mutation active (hazmat suit vs. a regular outfit). 
---
One odd thing I noticed was that many of the clairvoyant mobs there had a red aura... is that some kind of superpower mutation manifesting?
---
accidents happen. there should be a damage threshold. i came across someone's base being attacked by gulpers. decided to put them down. one of my explosive rounds let off minor area damage to a wall and i immediately became wanted. that's just ridiculous.
---
Melee armors weren't duped. 
---
No one in here has end game pvp armor. 
---
A thread of dummys with opinions on things they dont have experience with. Including you OP. What armor set do you wear?????
---
Calling for nerfs before you reach end game is a fuckin joke.
---
They should instgib most everything like bloody mess. It's a damn explosion! 
---
I did like all the previously far crys but to me, after a while they got kind of repetitive and predictable; reminded me of playing older metal gear games.  I have no idea how the new one will turn out though.  Despite all the issues, I still love Fallout 76, it gives me that nostalgic factor that I love.
---
What a cringey-ass thumbnail.
---
Do bots on parade easier then skyrim dragoon 
---
You get ten per run worth 25. 3 upstairs, 5 downstairs, 1 in locker room, 1 in bus outside. It's a nice little haul
---
I always leave mine unlocked these days, I only lock one of my 3 industrial purifiers.
---
Haven't had any issues. What were you running into?
---
Yes, I  noticed that too.  They seem to have scrapped  the 45-70 round from Far Harbor probably for simplicity  and ease of access.  They probably felt like it'd be simpler to make it use a shared  round than an exclusive  round only used for that gun, but I feel like that was a mistake to simplify it that way. Who knows if they'll ever change  it.
---
Good luck suing then, lmao. You're having a temper tantrum. 
---
six of us played till level..60-70 finished main questline, and most of the good secondary quests, then one of us got TSE. He murdered everything, for a little while. we got bored that same night, and then none of us have logged in since.  
---
I **hope** a major content update after they balance everything a little better and iron out the bugs, will bring everyone back for a second chance,but...i doubt it. The time frame for major content is probably like.. summer 2020 looking at their current track record.
---
The experience feels complete, cut short, but complete. There's a sense of closure in the group that used to play, and that normally means never returning to a game. 
---
That could work too. Anything that would still hold people accountable for damage but not set a bounty for incidental stuff would be great. 
---
I like bounty hunting in 76. Knowing that the person I’m hunting intentionally did bad things would make it much more satisfying. 
---
&gt;!I found a "Flatwoods Monster", thats a Zetan in it's own type of Power Armour.   When it showed up, all the enemies turned purple.!&lt;
---
Yeah that would be so helpful!
---
My Gamertag is ryannewbz :)

My turrets are attacking my own camp. It doesn't seem to damage the camp but it's still a nightmare being at my camp with 15 turrets all shooting each another the noise definitely gets to you. It's also attracting players and enemies to my camp which i'd rather not have. 
---
I removed all the turrets to get some peace and quiet it is bliss. Another point I'll make is that the water purifiers are not consistent with how often they yield purified water and how many, it's always changing between the three I have set up. 
---
All good mate. It was a long ‘un. Only intended as an attempt to have a chat about a topic I’m keen on but no expectations.
---
As you were!
---
They just need to bring the damn weapon damage back. Maybe even to only 65 or 75% but not 25%. The game was pretty balanced before they destroyed guns and made them useless. Guns are guns. Legendary two shots should be able to one shot everything. Especially when it comes to tse. I agree it was a little over powered but not really at the same time. Because if your build was for rifles and you go inside a building you actually had a fighting chance. Not you don’t even have any chance at all. Even with the tse guns. But most players don’t even have that. For all the legitimate players who didn’t go dupe searching for one there very rare guns. Leaving all the legit players fucked. Before every one smashed me for bringing tse into the conversation again. Think about how a bloodied rolling pen does more damage than a fat man now.Literally the most iconic gun in the game. Destroyed. And for what. To make cry baby’s happy they were getting one shotted for starting a pvp they couldn’t finish. I only have one tse gun and before I had that I got one shotted a lot but you know what I didn’t do. Cry about it. Because pvp is pvp and there’s gonna be people with better guns and better melee than you no matter how high ranked they are. I still stand by the fact the entire community needs a test server that runs for 24 to 48 hours at a time before updates so we can all give our feedback and point out bugs before they happen like the Bobby pen bug and a bulk item bug. And the bug that still happens to me almost every 30 mins where mutations just stop working. At least before the patch they only quit working when someone left your team. Now they just quit working for no reason all the time. 
---
Yup!
---
Don't you really mean make fallout great again
---
My I ask, What are your system specs? I have a hypothesis.  So I am wondering. 
---
Can you play solitaire with your perk cards while you wait?

Hide in a corner until the big red "DANGER" goes away?

Rose's syringer - shoot it with Karma and try to survive 60 seconds!
---
Yep, it's totally random.
---
LVL 112 And have never teamed. I found areas seemed to get easier once I got the LVL 50ish Mark. Apart from Whitesprings. That place is mental. You just need a good melee weapon and a ton of stimpaks and rad-x/radaways. 
---
You're build must suck if 5pts in demo expert isn't all you have to change
---
Lol i know, right.
---
I don’t remember where exactly, but one of the boats has several crates. I got over 2 dozen from it last time. I think it’s a tug boat.
---
Does this really work on anything? 
---
You can't sue for time spent or character changes etc etc, it's part on the EULA and terms and conditions you agree to by playing the game....
---
Didn't Mr Molotov say that the Soviets were dropping food aid but it was actually bombs, so they started making Molotov cocktails to go alongside the Molotov food packages 
---
There's a Mothman headlight coming to the Atomic Shop.
---
Some bright developer, when creating the item entry for that lamp simply *edited the red headlamp entry directly* (instead of duplicating it) so all red headlamps are now the Mothman headlamp.
---
Yeah this is a work in progress.fine art takes time and how dare you by the way expect to get what you payed for don't you know these guys have lives to!you can't just expect them to drop everything and fix a game like this overnight! They are a small Indy company and they are doing the best they can you entitled assholes
---
Honestly, it is so much it’s easier to make new characters and farm the challenges you already did on your main, as they’re not account wide.
---
Having to pay 1/3 of what the game costs for a skin is too much.
---
Yeah choices are what Fallout is all about
---
Contact my law firm: Hancock Valentine and partners. It we don't win we just stab everyone. I'll do it pro bono.
---
TSE is still very good. 
---
And can we have a reality show about this lawsuit?
---
I consider a major glitch something that is easily encounter-able and that can happen to everyone.
---
Something that a play tester can easily find.
---
I say major as in it can happen to the vast majority of players.
---
So you can already get the 45 degree snapping with the defensive walls, but this video gave me some great ideas on how I could create an octagonal tower and make the floors and roof work. 
---
You may know this already, but the defensive walls want to snap to adjacent walls, regardless of any interferences with floor tiles, so you can create an overlap on the floor within the wall to hide the edge. I imagine this will work with second floors and roofs too, but I need to test.
---
When the original teammate comes back it doesn't revert ownership though. These guys swap to ownership about eight times over the course of five minutes. We're asking them once we got inside if they wanted to trade and they were very specific about what we wanted instead of just going into a trade menu.
---
I'm on Xbox also!
---
Lmao TLDR
---
 "IM GOING TO SUE YOU BECUASE I NOW NEED TO LEVEL UP 5-10 MORE TIMES TO CHANGE OUT 1 PERK CARD; I KNOW LITTERALLY EVERYONE ELSE PLAYING HAS HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE BUT IM SPECIAL"
---
The real end boss is their development team. 
---
I do! Every pound counts!
---
because you're being extremely anal? you're picking on semantics. let's say I concede, that I did make a mistake. this isn't the English literature sub. my point still stands.
---
Fallout 76 is bad. by any factual standpoint. another fact is that Bethesda is making poor PR decisions. those aren't opinions. I could write that however and it'd still fall in line with reality.
---
Posted below...
---
A: damaged brain
---
A cheat is still a cheat, wether or not the devs decide to take action against it doesn't change the definition of cheat or exploit.  If there was unlimited stash space no one would use a mule.  The devs implemented a limited  stash.  A mules sole purpose it's to bypass that limit, that's a cheat.  I'm done here, no point in arguing with delusional people unable to come to terms with the fact they are cheating.
---
I've done the odd little skirmish with other players that I happen to have bumped into and they've been fun, but I have no friends that play so as a general rule it's just me!
---
crouch and ride it out u wimp
---
Ha
---
I'm on PC and noticing basically the same thing. I kept thinking that I was somehow screwing up or doing something wrong, but I'm not doing anything differently than I did for my other 93 levels. If anything it should be the best it's ever been. But nope.
---
&gt;Something our parents used to tell us when we were kids.
---
Never listened. Now they are old and senile. Still don't listen.
---
&gt;remember that this is just a game guys
---
I paid for it, so I should enjoy it. Most other things allow a refund it the product is crap.
---
&gt; God forbid our 100 to 600 hours of fallout 76 gameplay gets boring
---
2,000+ hours on Rust. Still good with a great dev team.
---
&gt;the reality that this is just a game
---
Nah.
---
&gt;I decided to get it despite bad reviews
---
Same here. I hoped that they would fix the issues, but should have known better. 21:9 support still doesn't work in Fallout 76. Bethesda never even attempted to fix it in their abandonware Fallout 4 (added ways to make more money for themselves, though), so I should have expected the same.
---
I just hope they get their shit together one of these years and churn out a decent, unbroken product.
---
Not saying I agree with it, but yes Melee and one rifle to hit things out of reach or force score beasts to land.
---
Anyone know if heavy laser turrets are better than missile?
---
I remember the meltdowns over new Vegas, so uh, yes I’d still play it. I’ve been playing it and while there’s been some hiccups and crashes, I’m still enjoying it for what it is. I paid $48 and if I stopped playing right now, I think the amount of entertainment I have received for that price is quite good. 
---
I also have a stealth build with healing factor mutation and have the same exact problem. Sure does limit game play!  
---
3 times? Jeez everyone must have switched over to a Bloodied Explosive build already. I figured killing the queen without melee after this nerf was basically going to be impossible as everyone essentially lost like 100%-280% of their ranged damage depending on what effects they had on their weapons.
---
Either that or the people not using melee were dealing like 95% of the damage during the fight, and the only reason for anyone to shoot her is to cripple the wings and force a landing.
---
Because we are overlooked for anything else.
---
Thanks, good to know it can be done - I've not played anywhere close to the end of the main questline yet (I don't think anyway) as I've been trying to do side/misc quests first.  
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
Nice build, OP. If i'd change anything, i'd just put 1 point in Tenderizer but otherwise, it's a great build.
---
This is mine which I call the [Situational Shotgunner](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fc43d45&amp;d=sb2sd2s01s22sv3pd2pk2pl2pp2ee2cu2ic4ib4i12s72a40lt2l71&amp;w=&amp;n=). The perks you see below, I swap for whatever event be it being in a team, blast zone or a SBQ run
---
I have another character that's only level 30 but this is her planned build, which I call [Maybe A Sniper](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f355be&amp;d=pd2pk2pl2eh2c72cu0ic4an2au2s72a00ao0li2lt2lu2pp2p02sb2l12l71&amp;w=pe2&amp;n=Maybe%20A%20Sniper). 
---
Hey, is the team aware of all of the bugs I've mentioned in this thread?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ala096/weapon_bugs_ive_encountered_so_far_and_some/?
---
I have noticed my game will take a minute to populate the Atomic Store game menu sometimes, have you tried waiting for a few to see if it shows up?
---
How can I get a silencer?  Sneak is totally my thing... I'm basically playing the FO version of a sneaky archer!
---
This used to happen to me constantly but patch 4 fixed it. Really frustrating that the bug has returned. Fastest "fix" I've found is just blowing myself up. Can exit PA on respawn. Just make sure are not overencumbered!
---
How much respect for yourself do you have, anything less than minimal, you should get this game
---
I'm not imposing any definition on anyone. If they don't want to accept a diven definition, that is their prerogative, but that doesn't change that it is an accepted definition among many.
---
I can neither confirm or deny.
---
I don't know about skins but I'd sure pay some real world $ to get a back back to add 50-100 lbs of carry weight capacity and maybe a special perk card to up the vendor cap limit a bit.
---
Yeah video game communities just fucking suck sometimes.. glad i’m able to enjoy the game on my own merits
---
There isn't a way or I would have traded them for in game items already.  I'll probably buy paint skins the future for PA since there is nothing else to do with them. (ones that haven't been released yet)
---
It was mostly heavy weapons and sustained fire in pa....
---
I was pretty lonely in my normal armor.
---
I will now dissect your comment. All of those games had and still do have disconnects from the server, crashing intermittently is a common thing in all multiplayer games depending on the time of day or the age of the game, final boss being prone is a unique complaint but I've had enemies slip into the ground on my in GW2 and GTA 5, credit card information being leaked is a more specific example but it was found that no ones information got out there, multiple MMOs bring in patches only to break something that is a fact of life and game design, the PR is actually a lot better than some other games (especially Payday 2 or BDO), please provide more examples. 
---
Fun fact: the majority of that happened to GTA 5 on PC, Diablo 3, and WoW. 
---
Log out 
---
Boys ... I just managed to kill all the high level scorched dickbags that were swarming the location, but now the Beast still hovers about. I’m near the fissure ...
---
It literally just happened. When I began an hour ago it was working. I wasn’t disconnected or anything. Someone said logging fixed it but I have workshop atm. Sucks that I have to choose between ammo or marsupial....
---
Oh! Oh! Yes, I remember watching your builds from FO4! Awesome! Welcome back!
---
Yeah 100% we need that. Sort by "top down" or something for armor. Or at least have a naming convention that might actually group all the same types together. It really is hard to keep track of what's what with any current sort. 
---
Thanks for the tip... I am happy to play along and cooperate with people at the odd times, and it's been fun when I have, but (I know this makes me sound horrible!) I play games to get away from other people haha!  
---
Thank you everyone.  All of you are the reason I'm back.  No more waiting, i'll have something new within the week.
---
Bwhahahaha! Good stuff.
---
That adds a layer of tedium that I feel would get buggy fast. 
---
Events:  
---
**Just make Events free to join.**
---
Then it doesn't matter if it's about to end.   They don't happen that often, it's not going to have a substantial impact on the money sink of travel cost.  This will encourage more people to participate, since there is no risk of losing caps just for trying.
---
As far as "Items as decor," I have a few little ideas- basically treating it like Skyrim. 
---
Can we make mannequins and load armor and outfits onto them? 
---
Can we display our power armor sets? Maybe in a locked power armor "bench"
---
Having weapon displays, also like skyrim, would be awesome. I wanna look at some awesome stuff I've found, even if it's not practical to use!
---
The bobblehead/magazine thing from FO4 was cool, but I understand that it might not be possible, how they function in this game.
---
Ways to show off little collectable items, like the gnomes or the teddy bears, would be cool too, but I'm not sure how that'd work.
---
That's my wish list! It would also, probably, solve the complaints of "Our stash it too small" if we can take these heavy items out and put them on displays. 
---
Just my two cents worth!
---
I do a knife build, most powerful build in the game.
---
And as an objective statement it is completely meaningless 
---
So make FO76 just like real life (for some)?
---
Yeah, I’m sure Tod will show Starfield and make some snide reference to Fallout 4. Like if Starfield is single player he’ll say something like “This game is singleplayer, we know multiplayer games aren’t our greatest strength” *smirk
---
the 20 percent isnt shown
---
Ghouls,scorched are all 1 shots with vats. Super mutants are 2 shots but 1 shots once adrenaline gets rolling or gunfu triggers.
---
Giant hp guys are another story of course.
---
Well just Thank now a bloodied rolling pen does more damage than the most iconic gun in the game being a fat man, and people saying the explosives don’t need fixed. I mean for the love of god guys, separate tse from grenades, missile launchers etc. make that perk go up to 5 with damage boost and put tse on there own perk Card and limit the damage the perk can put out. This would fix a lot of issues
---
I have killed the Wendingo wearing the dirty in-game outfit twice.  I have not gotten credit for it either time.
---
I'm on PC.
---
To be honest although I'm not a big fan of how PA looks, I'd have a go with it, but I can't figure out how to use it properly with the game system haha.  I have a frame in my inventory but then all the PA bits were separate so I just sold them (they were only raider bits).  I'll have to look up how to use it properly. 
---
I know your plates are full with all this already. But I also think it would be helpful if you could also confirm/refute rumors about how things work in game. Like how you recently said that the game isn't going to free to play.
---
For example, campsize. I've seen some pretty big camps in the game, during my travels. Certainly bigger than I'm able to build. When you try and find out a definitive answer via the forums, you can't. Some say that the budget gets bigger as you level. Some say it doesn't, just that items cost less. 
---
The mechanics and truth about camp size is all over the place. It would so great to hear something official bout this. Camp building is very big in this game. So some official word on camps and size and such would be so great. 
---
maybe with the Inside the Vault, there could be an additional section The Inner Workings or something, that takes a different aspect of the game, and sheds a little light on it.  
---
Just smash the Xbox punch the TV and run!
---
Thanks - the nearby player/monster level thing explains a lot for me actually, I hadn't realised that was the case!
---
So, on the lead, I would HIGHLY recommend hitting up the Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator PA.  The PA gives you 4x ore per vein.  You should leave with no less than 300 ore, and 2 ore smelt to 5 lead scrap. You may want to take Hemlock Holes Maintenance as it has 3 acid wells, you'll need it for that much ore.
---
You can not stack melee bobbleheads. This was probably me that did this to you, and you most likely were in a team that had initiated it
---
Ok sounds good. I will add you when I get home from work. My gt is phishntrips
---
Points in order.   
---
I don't give a fuck "why" it happened. They had a failed compile. It shows they didn't \_test\_ their code before they pushed it to servers. They didn't compile the new build, toss it up, log in with a character, and go "Oh, that's not...right.." and look for what went wrong. They just rushed it out, like they've rushed out the core game.  They deserve a LOT of shit for this "style of development".   
---
People stating that the condition of the game IS valid, and, frankly, having a fucking over-whelming wall of "You've fucked up so much the people who are fucking addicted to your game are leaving" Is a useful fucking tool. THOSE people are your target audience, bethesda. Those grinders are the people who are so into your game they'll spend money on microtransactions for stupid fucking outfits.   
---
Their reasoning for white night is \_bullshit\_. It's pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to keep armor repaired in this game without constant server hopping, because the sources for it are picked clean pretty much EVERYWHERE. You have to pray that you'll end up on a new server and be the first one to spend about 80 caps to hop around to all the locations that it actually reliably spawns, so you can keep your armor going for a fucking day.   
---
The patch did NOTHING but nerf things, mostly unnecessarily, and it introduced significant bugs, and re-introduced old bugs, including duping bugs that caused server stability issues.   
---
And, lets be fucking clear here, there are two types of youtubers about this game at this point...there are the fucking asshats pushing real world product and getting multi-bans, and the people pointing out the \_laundry list\_ of legitimate issues with this fucking game and company. 
---
I guess it gives more options for other perks!
---
It's a very heavy insect which you can sometimes encounter in the toxic valley. Bulbous and rotund, its massive girth is upsetting to behold. 
---
The bobby pin fix is easy, that’s why Bethesda is doing it. They’re not adding end game content anytime soon, that’s too much effort. Instead they’re increasing the grind so that the end game feels longer
---
I think the answers above about higher level players in the area seems to answer it - I hadn't realised. 
---
That didn't work so well for the dude in Flatwoods. 
---
Crashed space station is nice, I would go there
---
It does but some seemed cool to use but it would mainly affect your teammate instead of you
---
The youtubers should attack this piece of shit game. The patch also made guns practically useless and broke more things than it fixed
---
Oh I don't disagree, I'm just saying coming from fallout 4 to this people still need to adjust still
---
Ah that, thanks 
---
&gt;ally
---
I get that but it doesn't take much to just ignore threads you don't care for. Just click the new category and find stuff you're interested in.
---
Should they just send the settlement check to your mom's address and have her walk it down to the basement for you?
---
If I am in passive mode, I should not be able to harm a CAMP just like I can't harm a player.
---
They are talking about unintentional damage.
---
They just need to make all crafting plans and recipes use potential alternative materials. An "OR". Like, instead of Boiled Water for food crafting why in the hell can't I use purified water?! Why has it always got to only be the specific stuff mentioned in the Plan? Obviously I don't mean using mole rat teeth in place of ultracite, but sensible alternatives. 
---
It's been like this since Fallout New Vegas where you could only make soup with dirty water instead of purified. What the hell.
---
The only thing stopping me from downloading mod fixes for these "easy" fixes (when available) is the fact that I'd probably be put into a modded lobby with a bunch of goons one-shotting everything while dressed as mountains. But at least the basics would be sorted. _Externally_
---
Flatwoods Monster, Vendor bot outside of Charleston, alien gun, regular megasloth. I’ve run into Mothman once and Graham twice. I’m in my 80s. 
---
Replying to your comment in the hopes you see this. (PC)
---
Keypad power pylons currently don't require the use of the keypad. Anyone can pull the switch, making the keypad aspect irrelevant.
---
Changes to favorites aren't saved after logging off. I have to refavorite a gun with every login or server change and it's frustrating.
---
Thanks, and come say hi to us in r/fo76filthycasuals some time!
---
The store pricing is the problem.
---
I haven't seen this talked about... I use one of the powered doors with pin number access in my camp. You can get in, but cannot exit. I'm not sure if it's all the powered doors that have this issue or just some. My friend is using a garage door and seems to have the same problem. 
---
Straight Jackets at the asylum.  So many and sooooo valuable (in FO76 terms, anyway)
---
I didn't read all of this but the 60$ bar tab includes: guaranteed tipsy/ no longer thirsty or hungry, and possibly bringing back some hot tail.  Feeling justified that you spent time that had an impact in the outside world around you (no matter how small)
---
60$ for this game guarantees access to the storefront.  Everything else is subjective. 
---
to your topic: entitlement is such a weird argument, and i visit quite a few subs about gaming, i don't understand the argument, on any game.  I don't think i ever will.  People want to discuss what they don't like about a game, or what they like about a game.  I use the world entitled for people that get something for free, and believe they deserve more. 
---
tldr: Paying for a product, entitles us to...the product i guess.  Talking about the product is a god given right.
---
I had to scrap a TON of armor to get shadowed/muffled/stabilized for my stealth build.  You can run into shadowed plans randomly, but the most reliable source in my experience is to tag leather, cloth, etc for search and just keep gathering them until you learn the mods you want.
---
I waited a bit on combat armor mods, and Super Duper (luck lvl 50 perk) helps dramatically.  With three ranks, you get 30% chance of making double the results when you craft most things.  It's also great for making food, ammo, stimpaks, flux, etc.  If you need ammo, Ammosmith and Super Duper together help ease the burden on resources, especially if you're crafting 50 cal and 5mm.
---
3 star Armorer and Scrapper perks also help, as they reduce the cost of raw materials for crafting and give you a better yield on reclaimed scrap.
---
Sounds like a good deal
---
I'm currently an agility + luck pistol vats build but it is a slog right now to kill things. It wasnt really noticable when TSEs ruled, because they were so strong it kind of made up for the fact that pistols were so weak.  Now I'm contemplating switching to a rifle build but havent because I dont want to spend the time to gain 30 levels to change everything over. So... I'm kind of just not playing right now. Shame, really.
---
Last night, I was working on the quest where you go to Abby’s bunker for the master holotape to take it to Harper’s Ferry. When I got to Harper’s Ferry to the armory, the terminal would not let me load the tape. Every time I hit X (PS4) i would get a pop up in the top left that said I was suffering from snot ear. I could not cure the disease (is disease cure still an item that spawns in the world?) and finally gave up after 5 or 6 attempts. 
---
There was also an enclave event going on while I was there.
---
Maybe it's because at this rate amateurs would do better than the professionals
---
&gt;How the F is a normal player supposed to know how to navigate all of this bullshit to even play? 
---
Start by not buying games from shitty developers.
---
Hand-cranked firing is tied to swing speed, apparently. Might work with pump action shotgun too.
---
Is REALLY weak but hilarious
---
Well you also gotta take out any points you had in perception as well since guns fucking suck
---
How about reverting 21:9 support in the last patch? Have not heard anything about fixing it nor is it in this list. 
---
I was there few days ago. It looks nice, but after an hour of trying to get a nice looking picture i gave up. Its really hard to put it into the right perspective. I will revisit it and try again.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. 
---
Just analyze it:
---
It starts with victimism to gain sympathy from the audience.
---
Minorizes the vocal majority that is bashing the game.
---
It legitimates the nerfs in the worst way possible. "I dont use white knight, therefore the nerf is acceptable".
---
"Dlc for fallout 4 came months after the release of the main game, they're still on time".
---
Calls for understanding towards Bethesda.
---
I could almost bet that this user is someone from bethesda community management trying to pose as a normal guy. 
---
And the number of upvotes is just unbelievable.
---
Buuuuuuurn
---
Out of curiosity ... since you mention Interior Features, corridors, ceilings, etc... is this happening when you enter a new load area? I.e. whitespring bunker or buildings in watoga? If so it is simply a lag in loading. Happens to me often. I enter the bunker, run full sprint...whiplash back to the front door as server catches up with me. Load, take a breath, then run or walk.
---
A bad patch is entirely forgivable for most games, but this shit has been out for 3 months and the most basic of stuff is still not fixed. That's the entire reason people aren't forgiving of this anymore.
---
I don’t understand why people care so much. If you like the game then play. If you don’t like the game then don’t play. 
---
All the crying, whining, emotions, and break-up posts are cringy as f’k.
---
Some of these neck beards want Bethesda to go out of business over this.
---
It is just a game. Vote with your dollars or with your feet.
---
It would be a classic. 
---
And that is also a good name for that episode.
---
There's actually a law firm that's stepped up to handle any and all suits separately due to bethesda's toxic contract system, and is setting up a class action in california, where anti-consumer jargon in contracts isn't valid. 
---
 I sometimes feel like the rng is trolling me too.
---
If you don't like the game then why are you on this subreddit?
---
GTFO GTFO GTFO...I'm over lvl100, been using the gatling forever (with a speedy receiver) and didn't know this.....
---
??????
---
Thanks, feel free to post anything you've created in my discord,  [https://discord.gg/gufSxDg](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FgufSxDg&amp;redir_token=lc524Cl2_vhts7eUBii24l00TgJ8MTU0OTEyMDc5N0AxNTQ5MDM0Mzk3&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=VpzPUmfv960) 
---
I was looking at a web page.
---
I couldn't "do" anything.
---
This is the second time this has happened.
---
The first time, I thought maybe I "did" something. 
---
This time I was essentially, AFK
---
It actually does. Hard to aim it at a scorch beast though.
---
83 damage? Trust me m8 you were definitely not the one doing any damage, like at all... ever
---
I'm glad they're activity fixing bugs and improving the game with each new update.  I was surprised to find that they now made it so that learned recipies and plans now state "learned" so you don't buy them twice on accident and that rad away and rad x are now the same weights, where rad x used to weigh .25lbs each, I believe. Little surprised like that are reassuring to me. Hope they keep at it.
---
&gt;because you're being extremely anal?
---
I am a little aren't I?  Almost as anal as you are being stubborn.  Someone on the internet doesn't agree with you ... Oh no.  
---
&gt;you're picking on semantics.
---
No, I am not.  I am looking at your words and trying to gather meaning from them.  Because they are not the meaning you intended is not a semantics argument.
---
&gt;let's say I concede, that I did make a mistake. this isn't the English literature sub. 
---
Progress!  But I feel that you're just tired and not actually looking to learn anything, and will just repeat your mistake.
---
&gt;my point still stands.
---
Does it?
---
&gt;Fallout 76 is bad. by any factual standpoint. 
---
See, see what I mean about mistakes.  This statement in a vacuum doesn't hold up.  If I say "Fallout 76 is good", who is right?  There is no way to discern that.  The Production can be bad, because it was, the development can be bad, because it was, the PR can be bad because it was, but the product, as a whole, is subjective, and thus nebulous terms ... you know what, fuck it, you're not going to listen anyway.
---
Anyway, have a lovely rest of the day, and I hope you take a few seconds to try to understand that the people reading your words have no access to you thoughts or inferences and therefore clarity should be emphasized.
---
Try hards that bought Ebay guns are going to struggle with the concept of balance
---
They can but i doubt they would and i doubt the bank would side with Bethesda
---
Well, that's an interesting use of the word "major".  I'd have said something like "common" or "often encountered" myself.
---
For me "major" means something with large consequences.
---
When you hear a news report of a "major catastrophe" do you think it means a catastrophe that happens often?
---
Wait you managed to find plans for the confederate uniform?
---
Thank you, that sub looks good!
---
just...server hop. Unless you had balistic fiber, the junk doesn't matter. 
---
Yep. I'm not do casual but have played 99% solo.
---
No problem, another place would be the big resource harvester thing on the bottom left of the map
---
The fact that this post is still here and hasn't been downvoted into the ground gives me hope.
---
I'd only like to add that the die-hard players are an important faction and I think deserve some respect (within reason).  Which I think Beth does for the most part tho.  Just need to keep things in perspective.
---
Also there are legit complaints, lotsa bugs and balance issues.  And while Bethesda does a decent job responding in reddit, most players aren't aware of reddit.  
---
Most players are probably going to open a ticket when there is an issue, and it seems that Bethesda just does not respond to the majority of tickets.  That's pretty bad.
---
Exactly.
---
I was standing outside my camp with pacifist mode on and 2, 3 man teams show up. 
---
1 of them did something to both kill me and make me wanted for 50 caps.
---
I immediately crashed the came (pc) and logged into another server. 
---
I am of course still wanted and my camp was destroyed by the culprits.
---
I was under the impression that if I have pvp off, my toon is safe
---
Its called community management. They meddle with the normal folks and create false positivity.
---
Way too much grind for me.  
---
I heartily agree with all of this. Maybe instead of tying damage to weapon level, tie to condition and degradation.  Sure your level 5 10 mm does the same base damage is a level 25, but it is going to break after 50 to 100 rounds as opposed to 500 to 1000. But since the 10 mm was so nerfed in FO4 maybe have 38 revolver, not pipe, be your starter pistol. If I recall correctly you could pick up quite a few of them in FO 1/2. 
---
Well that is funny b/c heavy weapons are shite
---
We don't need the Chinese for that. We have our own government to destroy us. 
---
In terms of display items, I'd like to make the perhaps obvious suggestion of taxidermy. There's plainly models for various wall-mounted creatures in the game's files. It seems that making plans for them a reward for the "Big Game Hunt" daily quest would be an obviously thematically sound choice! 
---
Nah, I know what you are talking about and thats not it. It happens both inside Interior Areas and in the outside world. 
---
The best way to describe it would probably be that it feels like someone installed a second mouse and uses it to mess with you.
---
You must be a troll. No real person can look at this dumpster fire of a product and legitimately say "yep. That's the solid, quality product I expect from a massive AAA developer."  
---
Like... Are we playing the same game? Are you sure you aren't mixing up Fallout 76 and Red Dead Redemption? They came out around the same time, so I can see how the mistake could be made. Go have a look at your game and see if there's a cowboy on the cover.
---
Wow, i didnt expect that many responses so quickly. Yeah, I understand most of your loyalty to fallout and how that might bias your comments. Many people I talk with find the games to be very similar, but the only difference is that 76 is a dog shit quality game and farcry 5 isnt. Hence my anticipation that farcry new dawn is going to make 76 basically obsolete
---
...You know scoped hunting revolvers are a real thing and not just a videogame creation?
---
I mean I agree the damage values in the game are all kinds of messed up, but there is nothing "dumb" about a scoped revolver.
---
Source: Own a scoped revolver.
---
It’s pretty great, and can make the slow as fuck prime receiver a lot more tolerable.
---
So I’m sure they’ll nerf it soon.
---
When can we expect the next patch?
---
How about some improvement to Heavy Weapons and automatic weapons aswell as weapon weights?
---
 The Mire is nice:

---
When you eventually implement this, having an increased CAMP budget from it's current state would be much appreciated. I want to buy more items from the Atom Shop, but I can't fit any else in.
---
I’ve had the flue for three days now IRL.  I know this feeling
---
ha ha. 
---
Yeah, I work for myself and cleared my day and was looking forward to a glorious day of fallout 76.  Same thing!
---
Yes, they spawn on the dead civil war reenactor found as a random event.
---
I like to leave a bag of 1 Salt inside they base by the locked door.  I like you fertilizer idea as well!
---
Zenimax is upstairs at the Bethesda office. Why wouldn't ***ESO*** be the guinea pigs for the framework? It's been online for over four years.
---
FO76 maybe the test engine for further FALLOUT games (God help us) - but for all Bethesda games? I think not. 
---
 **Display Items in C.A.M.P. as décor**
---
* **STATUS:** We are looking into this for a future update and welcome feedback on what specific items you’d like to be able to display.
---
As other people have suggested, all the little things we find in the wastelands. Teddy bears and such.
---
There's been one suggestion that I think a lot of us have had and made. The ability to hang the photos we take in game as photos in our place. Like a simple black frame, white matt, then the picture. 
---
You just got to grind some more, get some more ammo, better weapons 
---
get ready for A lot of courtroom losses...
---
Teddy bears
---
Just seems kinda weird to not like a game but be on the subreddit for it. I mean, it doesn't accomplish anything. Unless you are just really really mad and are stuck on being mad.
---
Still using the mod? Everything is crammed at the middle of the screen. I have to click above a item in my pip-boy to click it.  
---
That's strange. I always barricade the entrances and then fast travel in and out. I figure if someone wants to take the workshop they can pick the lock and destroy the barricades. I'm not going to leave the door open so someone can just waltz in and claim it. Also I don't trust random people who want to 'trade'. Been down that road before. I let someone in to trade and they took over the workshop. Sometimes they still get in without destroying the barricades so maybe they use the fast travel trick. I just log out and see if the next server's workshop is unclaimed and take it. It's just more xp for claiming. 
---
I'm sorry to hear about your arm injury but glad to hear you're still getting paid. I'm just amazed to hear that type of hours from this game, heck I dont think I'm 100 and have nothing left to do except random events or go follow around low levels to give them stuff. I did copycat the death church, that was fun for a few days but got kinda spendy with caps.
---
THIS!  So much!  Come on in, use my benches, pick some crops, but close the dang doors on your way out.  Always can tell when someone has visited, every freaking door left open.  
---
Yep, sad state of affairs, that was one of my daily things. One has to wonder what Bethesda has in mind with all the "enhancements" they force upon us. 
---
RiP...sounds like this comment needs to be deleted before they catch on then..lmao
---
 Why I love this game. ;)
---
Brutal is the grind for ballistic fiber. 
---
There’s a cool cliff view by the palace of the winding path
---
Its a lot more about the fun and a lot less about the faults to be sure, which is more to my liking.  I hope you enjoy it.
---
Very loosely related (kind of decoration feedback), but seems to be the right time to spit it out: Actual working railways?
---
I think it would be awesome to see something occasionally moving on the rail lines (and with the info machines at the stations i tend to believe that was the intention at some point).
---
I don't use that gun for queens.  I guess i wasn't clear.

My helmet was broken on arrival. On of the mounting clips for the internal headband was broken so it is painful to wear the helmet since it now sits on your head. Not a big deal since I wasn't planning on wearing it, but still pathetic that it made it through QC.
---
 I was thinking more that I should get an early access beta to starfield or TES6 since FO76 is a complete joke. It was like buying a book that only has the first chapter and a summary of the remainder of the book in it. I hope it can be saved since I do like the concept, but as of right now I'm not getting my hopes up.
---
First of all, nice pics.  Secondly, one thing I think a good portion of folks agree on is that the world has a ton of great photo ops.  From the treehouse villages to the crashed space station (good suggestion u/bigpeepeeman42069), and other great structures.  I would also recommend to get low and high.  By which I mean, get to the top of the mountain ranges in hike around, you'll find some great spots.  Getting low and under bridges, or in dry lake beds/rivers can also give you a different perspective.  Who knows, you may start an album for each region and just get lost taking cool photos.

Hey, watch it with the personal questions

Why would this be downloaded and in controversial I don't understand I think something is going on with the downvotes and suppression
---
Great to know, appreciate the reply!
---
Ah thank you very much. For some time I been planning on gathering union uniforms, hats and black powder rifles to give out to people. Once I find the plans for the uniform I will not have to go and farm them.
---
Power stations should provide 30 power to all camps in that region. You place down a power box and it gives the 30 power if the station has been started up.
---
Apart from the plans there's not many reasons to do it right now though.

I use it on my 10mm Morgantown Airport pharma farma runs

Noooo, removed. This was my favourite post of the day. All the laughs it gave me. You will be missed.

In the highly unlikely event that those fixes transfer to other games, at that point I'll toss a little respect their way. As it is...nah?

I've seen a youtube video of a bunch of level 5's fighting it in the beta, but I've never encountered it myself.
---
So if I have 3 maxed out cards for melee, it doesn’t stack?
---
as a person who mains a pistol build I'm very supportive of this notion. I'm not sure why I stick to pistols, I just love them.
---
After the TSE nerf my best "decently viable in a number of situations" pistol became a "it's okay sometimes" pistol. It sucks! I'd managed to trick myself into thinking I was starting to do acceptable damage with my perks and my pistols but now I'm back to feeling like I'm more of an annoyance to creatures than any real threat.
---
That coupled with *whatever* seems to be happening with stealth means my main feels pretty useless right now.
---
Do you want more bugs? Because this is how you get more bugs.
---
I was defending a workshop and noticed someone at my camp. By the time I got there to check if everything was ok, the door was open and some wildlife were having their way inside. It's just common sense to shut a door. 
---
That's a gaming company regulation / rule and a reason they give you for not getting a refund.

The bank will just refund is its not advertised as a timed product.

Weird post but ok. This sub is for complaining and bashing on Bethesda. Sorry that nobody has told you yet.
---
Have you tried getting a friend to build a camp where yours is currently, join the server and it should let you move camp with everything stored in the blueprints to delete 
---
Yes but then you can fast travel to an event but not do it and go somewhere nearby that you needed to go to
---
No worries! I just feel if I wanted to look through a scope itd be better to use my Remington and really dial it in.
---
I prefer going full cowboy mode with my .357 Ruger vaquero  though 
---
I've read a few alternate suggestions that fast travel should 'cost' hunger and thirst, which I think makes WAY more sense.  But I agree, if there is no timer and/or progress indicator on the map, free would encourage me to at least head over and see if it is even possible to complete the event.  
---
Generally your workshop snapping system is lacking. The collision detection is absurd, and the restrictions are of a peculiar choice. Please at least bring back the F4 snap and placement system, thought I'd love it if you looked at some of the major mods (Place Everywhere) and took some notes of what people want in regards to freedom of building. 
---
Were we to be able to build in a more satisfying manner we'd at least have something to keep us going until you release more content. As is the workshop mode is .. lacking at best. As someone that worked on snapping and many workshop meshes, I can tell you they are very poorly made.
---
Class Freak does not reduce Energy weapon damage reduction from Grounded mutation. 
---
Strength can be a fractional number, i.e. when you use Buffout with chems effects reduced by 50%, which results in real carry capacity not divisible by 5, like 287 or something. It would still show 290 in the pipboy inventory, but you can see real number when transfering items into container. This results in weird overencumbered interactions, for example, you can hear an overencumbered sound but there is no icon and so on.
---
Super Duper proc sounds are queued after you leave the workbench. 
---
Also, power armor renaming -  "later in the year"? Are you serious? Do you guys have any idea what it means to carry three chassises and trying to get the right one?

AHH I am sorry if I reacted weird, I just woke up and was like "im jus tryna trade man...pls no attack". You did a great job with the outfit!

You made my evening my friend 😂
---
Hey you online loving morons got your game now accept getting the treatment you should’ve expected and stop trying to ruin everyone else’s already well past reasonable wait for better games.
---
I would imagine so, dont know whether Bethesda has acknowledged it, but its well known with frequent Queen killers.
---
This is cool as hell!
---
Tbh I stopped playing after all the crap Bethesda pulled, not because I didn't like the game, but because I was angry at the devs. I think now I'm gonna start making postcard-esque pictures for the different areas. 
---
I agree with you in principal but i'm afraid that everyone (and i don't want to exclude me) would then use events as a cheap alternative to fast travel and that would defy the 'travel fee'.
---
Its across all systems and widely known? I'm on xbox for the record and just because something hasn't happened to you does not mean it doesn't exist. But hey its pretty clear the only toxic one is you.
---
Hope you get help
---
Level 150 and have yet to see a Flatwoods Monster
---
Yep, I have lvl 3 sneak and I wear light leather armor. I also use a silenced hunting rifle, and now I'm detected in every fight, when last week I could clear entire areas without being spotted.
---
I haven't been crashing really, before or after the patch. I have gotten a few more infinite loading times though.
---
Honestly, I'm really surprised the 1911 didn't appear in Fo4.  It was a pretty nice pistol option in the New Vegas DLC.  The 12.7mm pistol was also very good.  I won't even get into "that gun", because the damage was good and the ammo super cheap and lightweight.
---
Higher damage and a similar ROF to the 10mm, even with a limited mag capacity, would make for an interesting build with Speed Demon, VATS and pistol movement speed perk buffs.  Even if you're not putting out close to the highest DPS in the game, you can possibly outrun a deathclaw and avoid quite a lot of damage.
---
Same with ore nodes.
---
Red Dead Redemption? I think I've heard of it. Isn't the online for that game basically a pay to win horse riding simulator? Yee-haw. 
---
They are plentiful, but they are also a half of a pound. Trying to keep a stash of 100 on hand in the case you need some immediately takes up 50 pounds of stash or personal inventory.
---
You’re not asking the game as serious imo. You don’t care that some perks aren’t valuable because you know some are really cool. You’re probably not competitively hunting down the SBQ or looking for legendary drops like they’re your birthright. The carry weight and stash is probably an annoyance, but it’s not that bad to scrap a cool weapon or two that you never use to you. I dunno, honestly I understand some complaints, but I also think most of these people are taking the game wayyyy to serious. Which is fine time if that’s how they want to play, but it seems so much less enjoyable to take anything so damn serious.
---
Ps4 has been buggy and still is
---
Personally I'm more concerned that Bethesda looked at the damage output of different classes of weapons, and leaned into the side of bullet sponginess.
---
Frickin paper bag bug!  
---
I've lost a couple things to it too, but they fixed it this patch!
---
The solution is to have the ability to convert glass into beer bottles like a reverse scrap.
---
&gt; free would encourage me to ~~at least head over and see if it is even possible to complete the event.~~ use it as a free fast travel.
---
ftfy :) 
---
What that’s not right I never got that
---
It’s not a free to play game so this “free ride” option isn’t valid.
---
They could do different types of molotovs. Nuka Quantum molotov would be interesting.
---
Oh, yeah.... sheesh, I forgot all about that.  Good lookin' out.
---
/S this game is the worst, yada, yada, yada... I'm taking my ball and going home
---
For anyone confused, I'm not trying to insinuate that she's unable to be beaten. I'm trying to organize this for fun and as a test. Telling me that it can be done with XYZ if you're solo doesn't help, neither does acting tough. I don't NEED to group up, I'd like to. 
---
Thought about logging on today until I read this... ffs. 
---
 Nerf city ...bes is just getting started
---
Try saving up any stealth boys you come across. Or get creative. One time I was low-level and needed that sword, so I motioned to some high-levels that were hanging around.  They followed me to the building, I triggered the ghouls and stood back while the other guys killed them. 
---
Afterwards I gave a big thumbs up and they did the same. Such a wholesome, friendly encounter!
---
Can you still now that the vendor plans have changed?  Is it listed at Phoenix for you know?
---
Idk a lot about it at all but it seems like Bethesda is big enough for this stuff not to be a problem for them
---
I was just on a team of new people yesterday and seems like every time I team up with someone new they have to go check out my camp. So I went and checked out theirs. Their camp doors were locked but open. I assume if you put a lock on a door then it is to stay shut. Being on a team means you can open your teammate's locked doors. (Some people don't know that. A new person I teamed with last night who was higher level than me did not know that.) So I shut the doors when I left. The one person that used my camp did shut the door so everything was cool. They had a few industrial purifiers at their camp too.
---
Disconnects are annoying but pretty infrequent nowadays. Most of the bugs I find are pretty hilarious. Last night I found a "dead" feral ghoul that was just permanently standing around shaking his head, so I got some great pics with him. I can think of very few times bugs have negatively affected my gameplay.
---
after all this months the CMs are probably also like "guys...can't you guys get one thing right? Now we have to apologize for your sh\*t again...uugghhh!"
---
I do this in self checkouts and driving. &gt;:D 
---
You don't want to see my petty side 
---
Shit, they should just rollback the update that broke everything and release it on the correct build. 
---
Take a screen shot while in photo mode. 👌
---
you're fun
---
Marine helmets
---
It's a quest that's currently disabled, but you run around collecting ballots and gain access to the Executive Suite of the bunker if you succeed (as well an an option to get one item from the related terminal up there)
---
I'll grant you that...
---
Rimmer?
---
Your title covered it. No one cares.
---
I actually have spent a lot of time in retail, and restarting work. People appreciate being honest and straight with them. 
---
The fact that it's only beer bottles and not something like Pickaxe Pilsner bottles or whatever is also a pain point. The most annoying thing is what you brought up, which is the half pound per bottle if you want to keep any amount on hand.
---
I have no idea, I haven't played online, but I did put 100 hours into the single player story. Hands down the most polished, gripping, gaming experience of my life.
---
Yeah... that’s why I mentioned that this build won’t be permanent and may get a nerfing.  It’s just massive dps, 500 bullet magazine, fast reload, and beautiful chrome atomic shop skin.
---
It also costs hunger and thirst.
---
And their 3D graphic is a vodka bottle. Yay consistency!
---
"I want pistols, which use small bullets with minor powder loads, to be actively competitive against rifles and shotguns".   
---
Pistols are sidearms. They aren't as accurate, they aren't as powerful, (generally speaking).   
---
I carry a pistol for minor foes to not use up good ammo and for the gun runner perk. 
---
just lol, hahaha
---
But, if i was online i would be there in a second :)
---
Nah, I am gonna keep it for now. It is the only rare outfit I have found. If I change my mind I'll let you know.,
---
Thx ;)
---
That’s a shame.  I would have gifted you my favorite 3* railway rifle if you were on PS4 because you clearly would have put it to good use.  
---
Really???...One thing no one should b#tch about in F76 is Atoms...Because first, its all cosmetics, those why it has no impact on game. Second, they give Atoms for free. I literally bought all my skins with Atoms I earned while playing and I had always more than I was spending. What makes it ridiculous, because how is your business going to work if you are going to give away free stuff???? If anything, Atoms should be harder to earn or shouldn't be earn able at all, because remember the exclusive Predator skin in BFV? Exactly, if everyone has the skin, then no one has the skin. Everyone b#tched about how pricey the Fatman skin is, 800. They lowered now weapon skins 50%. Minigun rolled out for 400. How many of you bought the minigun skin with Atoms you bought with money? 
---
That's the problem I ran into myself - I had more of them than I could gather oil to turn them into molotovs.
---
Modern US gas masks don't have a hood attached its part of the jacket. I understand that this is the FO universe and there fore make believe, but it makes since to not have the hood attached to the mask.
---
Ah ok I’m just confused because if it’s disabled then why is it in my quest logs. But thanks anyways

I have adrenaline reaction recipe if you are interested
---
Let me know where your camp is on xbox. I have a stairway to a floating platform as my camp and will find a server where yours isn't and put mine there just to piss you off. 
---
Even if development staff are dropping the ball repeatedly, know that at least y'all on the CM team are crushing given what you have to work with.
---
Won't happen because they will / might be back. Imagine reading about the great expansions later in the year getting rave reviews (yeah, I know, hyperbole...), and jumping back in just to be reminded that you gave all your good stuff away.
---
But the morbidly overencumbered should really drop their extra stuff in random containers all over the map; I for one love to stumble upon random stuff.
---
Thanks for the tip - I had tried to drag the ghouls out to the robots but there always seemed to be more, I could never get them all outside!  Will try again :)
---
-I'm getting stuck on workbenches when trying to exit. Primarily noticed at Whitesprings, and especially noticable on tinkerer and armor workbenches. When trying to exit, I get stuck in the "working" animation and my HUD disappears. Can't access the map, can't move. Only fix is restarting the game.
---
-My carry weight is fluctuating weirdly, and showing inconsistent numbers (ie carry weight will say 307 once, then 305 another time).
---
-When wearing shielded forest under armor, the armor clips through some outfits, noticably the scavengers outfit and the bomber jacket.
---
-When first entering a game and switching from a ranged to a melee weapon with the hotkey, it shows that I no longer have that melee weapon hotkeyed.
---
-Glowing honeybeasts are sometimes unlootable.
---
-Some enemies don't show anything for looting upon killing them.
---
-Still having an issue of "unlearning" learned plans, notably the Halloween Costume Witch Hat(not an easy plan to come across). Had the issue with the cuckoo clock too but it came back.
---
-Dropping items make them disappear from the game randomly.
---
-placing pictures on the outside of the brick walls cause some of the bricks to clip through the pictures.
---
-The responders eyebot refuses to speak after changing into a responders outfit to talk to him (random encounter).

How is 76 better? 
---
That doesn't make any sense and I don't believe that poster has any idea what they're talking about.
---
Goodbye legendary grey wolf, I wanted to see what loot you had but damn if that rusty van didn’t just send you in to ORBIT
---
Thank you, lots of good advice :) I appreciate you taking the time for me!
---
Thank you for doing what you are paid to do as miserably as possible?
---
Thanking someone for performing so badly at the one thing they are paid to do?
---
plonker!
---
&gt; All of those games had and still do have disconnects from the server
---
to the same extent as Fo76? because I know for fact they don't. I know for fact few games perform as poorly as Fallout 76 when it comes to connection.
---
&gt;final boss being prone is a unique complaint but I've had enemies slip into the ground on my in GW2 and GTA 5
---
you should look for a position in PR because you make it sound like the *final boss* in the game, which is extremele resource-intensive, having a high chance of crashing is no big deal. it's unacceptable, but you make it sound like "yeah, shit happens"
---
&gt;but it was found that no ones information got out there
---
again, your damage control skills are on point. it's ok this completely unacceptable thing happened because no one was hurt. it shows how incompetent they are, but don't sweat it- they're working to improve. indie companies get it right, but this poor multi-million dollar behemoth needs time to adjust.
---
&gt;multiple MMOs bring in patches only to break something
---
I can't remember a game that patched something and unpatched it in the next update because they can't keep their builds straight. I'm sure there are examples out there, but you're still making it sound like this isn't absurd.
---
with other games, patches that introduce bugs are the exception, with Bethesda, they're the rule. not to mention simple fixes that modders could put out in an afternoon, but Bethesda apparently can't for over a month. but everything's perfectly fine, right?
---
&gt;PR is actually a lot better than some other games (especially Payday 2 or BDO)
---
canvas bag fiasco, bans requiring essays, tickets not being answered within the timeframe they set themselves. Fo76 gained so much notoriety in part because of how poorly PR-related matters are handled. not to menton with this game it simply doesn't stop, they keep messsing up.
---
&gt;Fun fact: the majority of that happened to GTA 5 on PC, Diablo 3, and WoW.
---
nowhere near to the same extent or frequency as Fo76. this game is multiple times worse.
---
&gt;please provide more examples.
---
​why? so you can dismiss it as "shit happens lol"? there's no need. plenty of examples on youtube or this very sub. the name "Fallout 76" is attached to perfect examples of how not to handle things. literally just google.
---
Not trolling. Im genuinely interested in understanding why you said "entirely different ". 
---
It's going to suck for a while hoarding and tearing apart every hide, teddy bear and baseball glove you come across, but once you get your mods you can move on.  A lot of common melee loot, like boards from super mutants, will also net you some leather scrap.  Just pay attention to the resources you're using and tag them all for search.
---
When I was learning mods, I'd stop and make as many as I could when I found an armor bench.  It saves you the trouble of lugging around junk that you're going to craft with anyways.
---
The glowing burned earth looks awesome. I already made a picture of it with the excavator behind. Im sure to check it out again.

I5 7400 and a gtx 1060 6gb
---
Nothing is as legendary as dental hygiene!
---
They are working hard sure, but they should of fixed these bugs in Fallout 4. I don't remember many updates for that game. I even went to their site and the update referred creation club and optimize the loading screen, not gameplay.  I think we need to stop giving Bethesda credit for a terrible job, but also don't want to hear how terrible it is. Cause it's not the best but it is a worth while game.
---
I know from here on not to trust the Bethesda brand anymore.
---
I play on a standard Xbox and when I fire auto weapons it tanks my frame rate. Others dint seem to have this problem. I'm not sure why maybe it's related to OPs experience. Maybe there is some hidden variable that influences game performance. It sounds far fetched but so does everything else about this train wreck of a game.
---
Nice work, some creative thinking in this video. :D
---
I'm curious, you built a lot of foundations and roofs and they didn't seem to impact your budget much, even though they tend to add up. What level are you, and do you have any insights into how budget limits work and if there are direct ways to increase them? I've tried experimenting to find out if there's a gradual increase of some kind, or if the cost of purchasing items does decrease with levels, and I can't find any reliable conclusion. It does seem like budgets increase overall, somehow, as we play, but I just can't figure out the specifics. 
---
I respect that, it is a very polished game that's for sure. I need to play it more, but for my initial reaction, I was annoyed with how slow some of the animations were. I never made it out of the snow area though. 
---
I already use events to unlock points on the map I don't have yet. If someone's working on it, I'll chip in to help complete objectives. 
---
Getting a refund on caps if event completes before loading in would be a nice.
---
So... we eat the caps on the way only to find they don't satiate our hunger or slake our thirst?  Doesn't one OR the other make the most sense?
---
Thats lag, I am able to get a couple of short steps in with only 1 chameleon effect but it appears it only on the client side.
---
Or they’re like me and just haven’t experienced anything like all these ranting posts about gamebreaking bugs and glitches say. But I know that conflicts with the “game is completely garbage” mantra around here. 
---
Stopped using ranged before patch. Here's what I noticed running melee. Join sq event, everyone starts feeding her ammo while she is flying around, still nearly full health when she lands. Plug her with a armor pen syringer, pop some chem and start smacking her. People stopped shooting and let me kill her..
---
i agree.  im really tired of being the only one doing events.  after finishing the quests they are the only things that keep me entertained in the game.  
---
I dunno. Depends on if they end up with competent judges or not. 
---
PA is garbage in pvp. 3 star legendary is leaps and bounds better.
---
Theres not even a comparison. 
---
Most players arent pvp ready yet. Give it time. PA wont last as viable for pvp. 
---
PA is for picking flowers in nuke zones. Flower Armor. Power Farmer.
---
Your just playing against the player base that thought they were "pvp rdy" with garbage gear + a tse
---
The Gunslinger perks work really nicely for my pipe rifles build!
---
The only thing I've noticed is Serendipity proccing for me repeatedly, even though I don't have it active in my perks.
---
Super Duper seems to be working normally.
---
I picked up Luck Of The Draw today on my alt and haven't had it proc once on a melee build.
---
I feel like I have a lot of that too. 
---
Thank you, I have teamed up on occasion and it's been cool but I have a very 'people facing' job so I tend to game to get away from working with others! But thanks for the tips :)
---
By god it's fun to watch but do feel sorry for your loss, you will never know if you received your ghoul slayer gamma gun
---
I was expecting another "If you don't like the game then don't play it" dumb argument. Good to see something actually informative.
---
Agree. Thought I was going crazy when I was down to one left. 
---
Spreading some goodwill to the community who still logs in and plays this game even with all its faults? Nah. Bethesda still doesn’t seem to get that they used up that free pass enjoyed for so long.
---
switch servers.  i haven't fought a scorchbeast yet because of the ability to just switch servers.
---
Did you jsut assume my platform?
---
I would be dead in the first 3 seconds!
---
On WoW it really helped things, and items have a 'minimum' price if there is non listed IIRC :) 
---
Also who buys anything but Plans from a trader? I know me and mom if my friends do, and it's not me being sarcastic it's me asking an honest question. 
---
To me the NPC traders are basically 'give me 200Ⓒs for stuff I don't want and some plans I can learn please mr robot'. 
---
Sounds like stealth has a wrap-around issue, where too much stealth will actually make you less stealthy. Similar to the pocketed armor weight glitch maybe, where negative weight turned into infinite carry weight.
---
Oh come on man. I just quit immediately to get on here to let people know but someone already had. No reason to act like this isn't a valid complaint for some players. Everyone plays differently. I feel I play a pretty efficient way and when someone posts something that doesn't match my playstyle, I don't tell them they are butt hurt for complaining about a most likely bugged mechanic.
---
I've said it numerous times, it was really just the principle. BGS said they were going to hotfix some stuff, cool. But then they changed something had been fine since release. No reason any of us should be telling people what to be upset about it and/or decide how upset someone is. I may have been caught in the moment but I am not crying in my mom's arms (anymore). :)
---
I get it when I invite someone to a team it removes all good effects of mutations until someone joins or about 10 minutes. 
---
They made a post about that. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback?sort=confidence
---
Tldr it's planned sometime later this year. 
---
Thanks - think I need to have a look for a decent melee weapon!
---
I'm trying to work out how... Would you have any effects at all? Chems, perks, mutations, legendary armor?
---
Cry. Me. A. River. Emo. Kid.
---
Yeah same the asylum clothes are horrible to get. I'm only missing the Red one. Been doing the Events over and over again but i don't have luck with the BOS stuff. I think i will eventually buy the Missing ones
---
It is surprising how much blind hatred you hold. Literally google any of my examples and you will find that 76 isn't that bad.
---
But beyond that. If you hold 76 in such disdain then why are you even on this subreddit. Go to the fallout subreddit and circle jerk your anger over how 76 literally destroyed your life.
---
I was just saying that it already does this. It is weird that we need caps to fast travel. They could have used the railroads as a fast traveling system, if they want to ask money from it. 
---
I suspect most players would join the Event for free travel and immediately leave, which would be irritating for players who actually want to do the Event.
---
It's not really disabled, it was never enabled in the first place. Its part of the bunker that is under construction and the reason people know about it is that it's referenced in some of the game files (and some people used exploits to get inside the area).
---
The only reason it would pop up is as a bug.
---
Or at the very least, 2 star
---
313/334/115 fully repaired 
---
Level 248 here on PC. I've experienced more serious bugs like CTDs and frequent SNR maybe once in ten sessions, the enemy health regen thing for a while, and more innocuous things maybe once every few hours. I started 76 after enough previous Fallouts that I expected it to be far worse, given the variety of gameplay mechanics, open-world design, and first multiplayer game in the franchise.
---
That's not to say I haven't been frustrated at times, but overall this has been a "good" gaming experience due to all of the pros to go with these cons: variety of creatures and locations, lots of armor, weapons, and CAMP/workshop crafting options, and interaction with a mostly lovely community of fellow players.
---
More importantly, I think this will become a "great" game if we hold BGS accountable for fixing the most pervasive issues, improving balances across armor and weapons, adding new content, and keeping an open dialogue with the player base. They've certainly made mistakes, but they've also made steady progress (even if it's two steps forward, one step back at times).
---
Same here thankfully this idea came up in my mind. That way i atleast still enjoy it. I took a 2 day break and im gonna hunt for more pictures later and im actually excited to get around n take photos. 
---
17 days ago too. 
---
I’m using a Bloodied Explosive 10mm SMG and absolutely destroying everything around me. Hits for about 300. SBQ takes like 7 minutes 
---
But of course Bloodied Builds are still fine. 
---
The only nerf i know of is crit shots don't fill the crit bar like before.
---
And automatic vats is borked entirely
---
How?
---
Okay...  So I did as you said, and now I have a really mixed bag!  Get this.  That corrected the issue, but now I appear to be unable to become truly over-encumbered.  I get the notification that I'm over-encumbered, but I do not get the "effect" under Effects, and I don't have the Icon in my HUD.  I am prevented from sprinting but do not suffer the AP Drain and can still fast travel.  I've logged out and back in to see if that changed anything...  nope.
---
You sir, appear to have given me super powers!!! muahahahaha!!!

Hybrid melee &amp; rifle, I play at ~70% rads in pa with emergency protocols.  Still very tanky and do very good damage in melee especially, but still very respectable with a rifle as well.

It absolutely does.  You can test it super easily.  Fire rate goes through the roof.

I actually have my house and acid extractor locked, but leave my garage openable with all my crafting benches, with a stash box,  an extra bed and a banjo if there are any visitors. Water purifiers are unlocked if they need it and decontamination arch is available if they nedd. I've come home a few times and have seen people using them. I wave, unlock the door to the main house and let them explore if they want.  Not much to see.  Just have a living room with a fireplace, a kitchen, a music/entertainment room and bedroom with a large balcony on the top floor.
---
I wish more people would visit. 
---
the worst is i made my character with male pattern baldness (like me!!!)and when hes in the ashheap and needs his mask i know his poor head is cold, no matter what you say.
---
Damn now you say it how could i forgot about that sick looking temple. Gonna head there later thanks very much. Maybe i can include the temple and the cliff in the back. 
---
I was looking for this comment because this was my exact first thought when I read this BS.
---
You can loot from your Turret kills
---
I got this issue where the game is a giant wet shit dropped on my face.
---
Twice, one in Flatwoods, and the other in the Mire.
---
I’ve had serendipity proc without even having the perk equipped lol. Wasn’t in a team either so it wasn’t being shared. 
---
Only herbivore buffs? Not carnivore? 
---
All slugger perks, max strength tree, twisted muscles, bobbleheads etc etc
---
I'm sending my personal details to you by FedEx, I hope we shall have a long a meaningful relationship.
---
PS: Do you like rubber and spandex?
---
I dont think I like any of the survivor stories because, well, there are no survivors.... 
---
One. One bad patch is forgivable, once in a while, of course shit happens, deadlines are a things, mistakes occur. 
---
Every patch to date has a common theme, though. It introduces new bugs...in this case, both legitimate new bugs, and re-introducing OLD bugs.
---
Every "balance change" consists nearly completely if not completely of nerfs. I believe the last patch had one, minor, buff to one weapon barrel? That's the only buff that's occurred since launch that I'm aware of. 
---
Every major gameplay change, such as this "plans are available...for 20x the price" (or whatever it is? I don't know what jetpack plans were before, but they're around 6k now). Comes without a co-insiding increase in ability to make caps. In fact, they NERFED cap farming in this patch. 
---
That's the pattern. The game gets slightly more stable as they iron out the old and new bugs. (and if that's ALL they did, I'd be singing their praises. Expecting legitimately new content at this stage would be nutty,  and ANY forward movement on stability post launch is a pretty new concept for bethesda as a whole). And it gets a _lot_ less fun to play. 
---
That makes so much more sense. I was building in my camp and then running for supplies and I thought the math did not add up with my weight and supplies. 
---
A lot of the season stuff could be done with sets of textures that get swapped in every few weeks or months. The rest are just variables that can be adjusted, like the ability cards that give us advantages during nighttime or during storms. 
---
How original! Not like your camps.
---
The one picture i took in the mire is one of my favorite so far. The scenery is beautiful and the atmosphere with the dark, greenish swamp is gorgeous. 
---
Same here, although I use a two-shot laser gatling with prime receiver (with heavy weapon perks and tenderizer). It seems to still do noticeable damage to the SBQ.
---
It is a blatant lie. I'm not even sure how this post got so many upvotes considering how many other posts are absolutely shitting on this update
---
yup.  same here.  
---
So it’s a bug then and I cant actually bypass getting the commendations then ok then 
---
In fact I would wager the people in this sub are much higher than 17% of the people that play this game given the fact that I've been on servers with so many names I've recognized from this sub without being psn friends with them or knowing them in anyway other than just seeing their posts on here.
---
I’m not sure what event you played. I recall being attacked the whole time while fixing it.
---
I just have a double gatling with 50% crippling but the extra 250 bullets before reloading is nice, I will have to try this build out 
---
I've been a member of your forums for so long I don't even remember when I started my account. I remember every week like clockwork hanging out talking with everybody during the eso weekly server reset....the most important part of the week. Everyone could always tell when it was the night before server reset because of how unstable the server got. Is there a reason you haven't implemented this same pattern here?
---
As far as completely eliminating the plague of duplication glitches why haven't you followed, again, your solution used in eso? Simply making the most valuable, rare, and powerful items account bound? Why???? It's almost like you are supporting these dirt merchants.
---
I'm giving everything I I have to stay with you guys here, some of my best gaming moments ever are from games you've released, some of my closest online friends as well. With every update, every hotfix I lose more faith in a company I have held in the highest regard for close to 2 decades. It's a very hard thing to deal with. Please, please fix this game. I'm begging you.
---
Bobby pins wasn't a bug at release but it was already fixed yesterday. Sbq is serious i agree but also makes sense lore wise. Maybe she retreats. Haven't had a crash since the patch either so maybe servers are stable. Never had that many to begin with though.
---
i mean who is your favorite just from listening to thier storys
---
Hmm. What level are you?
---
Power armor boosts your Strength to 11, so players that are normally below that will gain +5 carry weight per point gained.
---
You know that one thing people hate more than anything, lets replicate that in quest form.
---
Are those photos in Watoga High?
---
I was planning on actually actually actually doing a gunslinger character on my second build 
---
Apparently there are known issues of which they are unaware.
---
&gt;what is the purpose of keeping bottles from being scrapped? 
---
Like OP said, you need beer bottles to make molotovs, which is why they don't auto-scrap. The same applies to death claw hands, baseballs, mole rat teeth, and a handful of other things that are considered "junk" but are used in crafting.
---
I re-upvoted one of your downvotes. I left that sub, it started feeling more toxic than this one!  No thanks. 
---
Die, Die, Die my darling!
---
Only lead and aluminum from what I've tested.
---
 Touché ;)
---
Never mind. I see its 27. T
---
Yeah, gotta level up a bit.
---
What's weird is I don't think I've seen Bethesda comment on this qol feature, in any thread/post. why not?
---
I was tabbed out looking at a web page. I could't "do" anything.
---
If I want to pvp, I can get the armor, team up, build that out and do it.
---
But when I am just doing nothing...it's really the developers responsibility to protect the gamers from stuff like this.
---
It's re-god-damned-diculous.
---
thanks, dang I've wasted a lot of plastic
---
Yeah, I honestly hadn't noticed the hit on hunger and thirst, hadn't paid that much attention. The railroad idea is a good, organic suggestion.  I know they want to encourage exploration, but it just seems a tad forced.
---
The base reload rate is very fast with martial artist already, so I wouldn’t try and choose this if you had another option, but it would be an amazing weapon to cripple the Queen for example, which prevents her from flying and increases damage shes taking 
---
lol "emo kid". 
---
Time to record that last holotape 
---
The 100% to 75% hp shouldn't be hurting you too much. I would expect your dr to be higher tbh. I'm running unyielding and getting 410 dr (only Bos chest, rest leather). Dodgy is a big factor in tankyness.
---
you cant bulk anything atm because they unbulk and waste your plastic
---
Yeah but a timer would be better than what we have now, even if there are some variables...
---
Or get Rank 3 Pharma Farma and hit up a hospital or other places with lots of medical containers.  You'll probably get enough Chems to sell too.
---
I haven't really lacked Disease Cures since then, although disease seems so frequent now that I often run it run its course too.
---
&gt; That is a pretty big nerf to not mention, if so.
---
Agreed. But it wouldn’t shock me they didn’t announce it. 
---
Please keep me/us updated and I’ll try to remember to do the same to time it.
---
I love that mine that's on fire. I survived. That's my story :)
---
lmao okay chicken little
---
I farm a few different places a couple of times a day. When my vendors are back up, I bulk all my junk down to a certain loose threshold I maintain. I then vendor hop but while doing so I will pick up junk. When I cross a bench I will go ahead and scrap it. This is mostly just me being OCD about having max weight capacity.
---
Some days I'll reach my vendor cap limit and just keep the bulk in my inventory because it usually isn't taking up much space. So if I go out and farm again I would have to avoid hitting bulk all. I've stated a couple times this isn't anything major I could just adjust how I play and throw the extra bulk in my stash. It really just comes down to BGS changing something without intending to in order to fix something else. 
---
Most people probably share my sentiment that the ineptitude on display here just makes it hard to have faith in the game. I will continue to play because I love the game despite all its issues. Hopefully if enough stick around they will right the ship at some point. I haven't given up but was just really irritated yesterday when I realized they messed up on the most minor patch.
---
Yes because if we ever lived in an apocalyptic scenario everyone's entitled to their fair share of lead and plastic.
---
Great pc mod out that already does that, it's called save my stuff pretty much essential.  Hope you console players get some love 
---
Honestly a great breakdown of what this post is, and why people *shouldn't* listen to such a slanted, terribly structured/thought out "argument", but this subreddit loves it anyway because it validates them.
---
That’s what I do now, but I end up having to delete the ones from photo gallery in game cause it fills up quick. I want them to go directly to captured would be easier 
---
And lazy design.
---
Also vertibots could have been used, just like the vertibirds in FO4.
---
A couple of animation bugs with power armor:
---
While walking in first-person in power armor with certain guns out(confirmed with the Crossbow and Black Powder Rifle), footstep sounds and headbob play much faster than they should. You don't *move* faster, but it's like the game doesn't realize you're in power armor and so it sounds like you're quickly shuffling your feet instead of taking the slower, longer gait that's normal for power armor. I've seen this before in Fallout 4 mods that add weapons with new animations - I'd suggest testing every gun in 76 that wasn't ported over or reuse animations from Fallout 4.
---
Similarly, while in power armor, Spears and Pitchforks use the standard slow animation for two-handed weapons, instead of the medium-speed animation unique to those weapons. This one affects gameplay, making those two weapons worse than they should be.
---
The Tesla rifle works with rifleman yet this one doesn’t? I wasn’t aware of that. 
---
Spoiler: im staying in adventure mode to continue to greif them.
---
Yeah, I didn't notice until I looked the second time around
---
How about just leaving events open until someone activates them? Then you could start a quest timer once its activated.
---
I used to do that stuff and then realized I've got so much of everything I don't need to. I leave everything unlocked and make sure I put down some good protective turrets and punji boards to protect extractors, and I leave everything up and unlocked unless I'm in dire need of that item. 
---
I find most of the time people just come by and take what they need and use the crafting stations I put up and don't mess with taking the workshop at all.
---
especially so since my range damage revolved around sneak shots and crits, and as of current, I can only get one sneak shot in before being mobbed.
---
PC Platform here - Played a few hours of BETA and cancelled my pre-order. Picked it up for cheap around xmas, started to play first of the year. Up until patch on Jan 10 I was fine - 1 or 2 reboots in that 10 days. Post Jan 10, I had 2-3 + reboots in a night, some were rollbacks which made me to stop playing everyday and I would periodically login. I believe they stopped because of the banned accounts. Jan 29th i have no issues with aside from i am going through a lot of food/water. I have had no server reboots so far in the two days. None of my perks or weapons seem to be working differently than before.
---
Usually when I've had this happen, it's because several players joined and left the fight. I believe her damage mitigation only scales up, so joining and leaving or just not positively contributing doesn't help
---
No one is capable of shooting pistols accurately dual wielded
---
They exist, fight them a lot in savage divide and cranberry bog. They don't put up much of a fight.
---
why would I carry bulk around tho? I bulk and put it away
---
I have a theory that Bethesda makes Fallout 76 work perfectly for one in a thousand people, on purpose. As a joke.
---
LOL.
---
So you have an entire arsenal of TSE weapons that each have a 1 in 2,000,000 chance of dropping.
---
You suck at math. You bought your duped weapons. People like you are what is wrong with this game. Fallout was never intended for buying the best gear.
---
:D
---
* **Mods Being Scrapped**  
---
* **STATUS:**  This issue was addressed in Patch 5. The fix that went into place made  it so loose weapon and armor mods are not able to be autoscrapped when  you craft. However, if you choose to break them down can still scrap  them if you select them.
---
@BethesdaGameStudios\_ The workbenches now auto-scrap ALL bulked items in your inventory since the hotfix. They are no longer 
---
That is what happens already as far as I know, but if another player HAS activated the event then left the area, it continues to count down.
---
The key difference is that you don't have to pay anything to play the game, but other than that you're right. My GF and I play a few hours a week at most, and I usually end up earning just enough Vbucks during the ~10 week season to buy the next battle pass without spending real money. 
---
That works out to roughly $.90/week in "free" in-game currency. 
---
I want this, but it needs to come with a stash increase. I want to be able to use these types of weapons without making it the main for my character.  
---
I killed one in the mire.
---
I've noticed serendipity proccing for me too. Super Duper has been fine.
---
With Four Leaf Clover ranked to 3, I would fill the crit meter very frequently. Sometimes back-to-back but usually every few VATS hits. Now it seems like the crit meter fills at a steady pace regardless of the perk being equipped.
---
"Edit: I know the game is riddled with bugs, as most every game is. But my experience with the bugs have never been enough to hinder my gameplay.
---
I guess by no problem I mean no game breaking problem."
---
I can't describe any experience "riddled with bugs" good even if they arent game breaking. And I completely reject the notion that even most games are, or that that it is something that should be accepted.
---
In fact, add more events that impact the whole server
---
Wouldnt worry too much. Just try getting a super sledge. Once you get around LVL 40-50 you'll probably be hitting Watoga. Thers a quest there called Mayor for the Day. The reward at the end is a Legendary sledge hammer call All Rise which is arguably the best melee weapon in the game. Blade of Bastet is very good too which you get as part of The Mistress of Mysteries questline especially around the mid levels.
---
&gt;Almost as anal as you are being stubborn.
---
because the game is bad, that was my point. I don't care about whatever point you're trying to make since you're even challenging mine, just the way I presented.
---
&gt;I am looking at your words and trying to gather meaning from them.
---
that's semantics. I just googled it so wouldn't start a whole another argument. look: "the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning."]
---
&gt;But I feel that you're just tired and not actually looking to learn anything, and will just repeat your mistake.
---
probably, since I'm here to dscuss Fo76 under an objective light. not the English language.
---
&gt;Does it?
---
yes, it does. the game hasn't improved at all since we started this discussion.
---
&gt;This statement in a vacuum doesn't hold up
---
except it's not in a vacuum. I quite clearly stated "by any factual standpoint"
---
&gt;but the product, as a whole, is subjective
---
not at all. if every technical, measurable, factual aspect behind something is bad, then the product itself is bad. your personal take on it however, is subjective, and something I don't care about at all.
---
&gt;the people reading your words have no access to your thoughts 
---
in my time here, you're the first one being so anal. most people understand what I'm trying to communicate perfectly, and just call me a dick for it.
---
you're the only one who felt the need to dissect my wording without at all challenging the point I was trying to make.
---
EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THIS: FIX IT SO THAT THE AUTO GRENADE LAUNCHER IS A HEAVY WEAPON AND THUS GETS THE BENEFIT FROM THE PERK.
---
IDK man ask your mom
---
I speak of regular ranged weapons, without legendary effects and especially without any two shot explosive effects 
---
Thanks!  I appreciate the heads up!
---
I'm PS4 and am in the same boat. I think at this point its just luck of the draw this point. Issues certainly exist, but they just don't affect everyone to the same extent.
---
I've fought two, both in the mire
---
woah that's edgy a mom joke
---
Ya people are stupid, they think “oh i cant kill a scorchbeast in three shots anymore? TSE are shit now” like... they are mini-bosses, you are supposed to be able to kill them in a few bullets, and they taking like a 60 ammo to take one down because they arent taking advantage of the multipliers they could be taking advantage of, and i am positive that melee is going to be nerfed eventually so i dont get why people are crying that melee is op
---
You know I kind of like the idea of diseases messing mutations, it kind of make sense even if the result of a bug.
---
Thing is the game engine has difficulty even with textures and lighting. The ability cards can work though.
---
My hunting rifle does abou 145 and I'm not really "melting" anything. I feel as I'm just at the cusp of gaining power and have no where to go. 
---
still can't figure out why the heck there is a sloth running around west virginia, though...?
---
Don't beat yourself up, it's basic human nature to waste plastic like crazy.
---
Scrap as you explore. There's workbenches literally everywhere for this. Dump junk in stash when in base. Get a couple of the dozens of perk cards that reduce weight. This isn't a problem at all for me and I'm lvl 22 too. Also don't take literally everything you come by. Figure out your build and prioritize junk with the search function.
---
nerfs/fixes one thing, breaks 100 different things causing new problems.
---
Vault 96... I think it is.  North East on the map. Read all the terminals.. no spoilers 
---
Saw an article on Kotaku today that they are literally GIVING THE GAME AWAY to people that buy a controller  in Germany...lmao!
---
you're right
---
Maybe you don't handle math very well? xD
---
The u are right. I agree, that in passive mode one should not be able to damage player structures 
---
They are common around the east of the map near abandoned bunker and the tree houses. Also one can be found patroling End of the World.

/u/BethesdaGameStudios_ The workbenches now auto-scrap ALL bulked items in your inventory since the hotfix if you select the "scrap all junk" button
---
Bannerlord, when?
---
I've killed a bunch of them in the mire. Even their babies. #ohthehorror
---
 I was looking for firecap locations. Thanks for the tips!
---
Great ideas! And why the hell are people downvoting? Smdh 
---
Hmmm...
---
How about we ask for door closers?
---
I like the idea of finding a novelty weapon in the form of a powerful legendary effect on a terrible gun like a pipe pistol or revolver. It would be really fun to use in lower level areas. Too and explosive isn’t a good legendary anymore
---
I noticed this last night as well.  I topped off before an sbq fight and about 10 min later my thirst was in the red and hunger was at about 50%.  It feels like it's draining about twice as fast as it did pre-patch.
---
Oh yeah, forgot to mention that.  Quite profitable for either chems you need or chems to sell.  Good call
---
The issue is that, even with a bunch of Vanguard pieces and huge DR/ER, you'll still take a ton of damage from big bads like Death Claws and Yao Guais, which gets more and more damaging the longer the fight goes on.
---
I used to use three Vanguard pieces, and a set of 200% condition BOS Chest Armor and Studded Leather Limbs, along with Scaly Skin and Ironclad. Never used Power Armor except for in Nuke Zones. Ended up with ~500 DR/600 ER, but the strongest things in the game still tore through me like tissue paper.
---
And then after the last patch, and the changes to Rad-X, Rad Worms, and White Knight I said "Screw it, let's give my T-51b Power Armor a spin in normal conditions."
---
Now I have 650+ DR/550 ER with even less perk investment and everything tickles me now. Took a nice, casual stroll through my first silo yesterday in my big tin can. But the BIGGEST difference is healing. Not having to go through an animation to heal makes keeping topped up a piece of cake. 
---
Basically, my point is that no matter how big you make your Resistances or Health, the game and enemies are designed around you wearing Power Armor in the most dangerous areas. PA seems to have hidden buffs for resisting incoming Damage &amp; Radiation, and lets you heal almost instantly, AND lasts longer and is easier to maintain than normal Armor after the latest patch.
---
" sneak is overrated" ~some guy in slur in
---
I feel the problem is more Skins being grossly overpriced compared to other Atom Store items than an issue over the value of Atoms.
---
I just want Dogmeat as a companion. A quest to get him would be nice. And it has to be accessible for low and high level players. 
---
Ha!
---
40 IRL here. "It's Dangerous out there. Take This"

what kind of drops? anything good?
---
If you're on Xbox you should look up our group. We have a ton of fun.
---
TEH RED ZMAN
---
Marsupial, Speed Demon, Healing Factor, Chameleon would be what I would recommend.
---
Marsupial is to be able to jump up to perches to snipe from that melee can't reach you.
---
Speed Demon is pretty handy for faster move speed when sneaking and faster reload speed. You get hungry faster so I would recommend Thru Hiker for food/drink weight reduction.
---
Healing Factor is awesome for a sneak build. When you go from caution to hidden you'll see your health bar go back up to full. Not having to stim when taking radaway out of combat improves quality of life
---
Chameleon is good if you go with weightless armor or when you switch to a hazmat suit. If you're donning the maiden of mysteries outfit for the set bonus it'll trigger for that too.
---
Careful there, someone from Bethesda might see that and think that black powder weapons need to be ""balanced"".
---
This has happened to me. My guess is that it has to do with how people are dropping the nuke. The "smart" way of fighting the queen is outside the fallout circle, so there's one less thing to worry about. It seems that if you drag the queen too far to the edge though, she may fly offmap and get stuck.
---
I haven't noticed this if you fight the queen closer to Watoga. Seems like fighting her on the east edge of the map is more risky.
---
I love reading posts from people who go insane because they spent *hours* on their camp and someone's one room shack is where their awesome camp was and can't be put down. It's such a travesty hahaha. I've logged in a few times and haven't had my camp and it wasn't the end of the world. **It's a game.** If you can go to another server and find your camp there then do that. You want the munitions factory to make some 5mm and it's taken? Go to another server! I wonder what these people are like in daily life. They probably flip out when there's a line at the supermarket. 10 items or less and someone has 11, oh noooooo! 
---
Has anyone else noticed an issue with Two Shot weapon accuracy in VATS? 
---
It seems like they miss way more than they should. Just an observation. 
---
I can't remember which one, but the CEO of one of the big mining companies has an enclosure for them in her building, suggesting they were escapees from there. 
---
👏👏👏
---
He's right, you know.
---
You could compensate the healing with a PA Medic torso mod, and not worry (unless the scorched deathclaw and yao guais decide that you look the yummiest of all the players). Having a dedicated anti-SBQ gun with the prime receiver is definitely something to consider though.
---
I use them at Whitespring to kill players that think theyre cute going in to one hit melee every single glowing one before anyone else tags them. Yes, please, run through the parking lot on your way to the condos and garage. 
---
This is why I shell out the few bucks for Playstation Plus, it backs up all your data.  All it took was one time losing hundreds of hours of saved games and I won't take the risk ever again.
---
This is the only way it could be done. I'm sure they do not plan on adding anything this taxing on their servers. Especially since they have not increased stash size because of their stability issues. 
---
I did see another post where someone commented about not having the blast radius shown on survival. A Bethesda rep responded and passed it to the Dev team.
---
Sometimes it take a minute or two to appear on the menu 
---
There is a super simple solution: double the damage of all explosives, except the legendary effect, while keeping the demolition perk card intact.
---
the one right out in front of the clubhouse by the tennis courts
---
I was there for most of your examples. played GTA5 and Diablo 3 on release. played WoW before it was cool. I know exactly how they performed. and it was infinitely better.
---
and I'm here because I like the game and want to be up to date on it. but just because I like something doesn't mean I'm gonna pretend everything's fine, I'm not a blind fanboy.
---
if the main Fallout sub is a circlejerk of negativity then you're the exact opposite. no winners there.
---
You are really overestimating how small that number actually is, no game EVER gets back the majority of its initial player sales/base. Its all a downslope to whatever average it will be at depending on reception and will rarely change. That average base is nowhere near close to the millions, but still healthy given the active community here.
---
lol, super mutants and mole miners have such a low perception that I can bump into them as I sneak past and they probably won't notice, and if it's filled with ghouls it's kinda like practise for the Monster Mash :p

Example: Uranium fever starts a timer by simply walking into the area, the timer should not start until someone either talks to the foreman or starts the extraction process IMO
---
Melee seems like the only good full build to go for these days. Rifles are good for enemies outside of nuke zones or beasts too, since rifles (with enough ammo) can drop enemies even up to level 50 or 60 relatively fast. But for raw damage and ability to kill w/e melee is the only remaining viable build it seems. Which is fuckin sad
---
Speed demon for getting out of bad situations quickly.
---
Marsupial for getting up high to sniping spots (and it’s just plain fun).
---
Eagle Eyes for the perception and critical damage boost, good in VATS.
---
Chameleon I have, but I have not found it to be as useful as having one piece of Chameleon armor and then beefing up the other armor pieces to something more useful. I use Vanguard +35 resistance when high health.
---
It’s not in the game because it’s an XP boost, and those have been severely limited in this game.
---
I've seen a couple other posts now saying similar things. Seems the cause of this issue is fairly inconsistent. At least they are "looking into it" now!
---
What about balancing melee weapons to put in line the absurd damage they do compared to ranged.
---
Right now melee builds totally outshine ranged ones. Heck there is a 3stars STR perk that gives you 75% melee armor pen. 
---
How could you miss that?
---
I can get the folks who are frustrated cuz all these people are getting online and they're complaining about the game and talking about they're quitting. I get that. But it also sounds like they're whining and some folks are annoyed. But it's a statement, a growing statement. It's these statements that Bethesda needs to hear, it's these statements on Reddit that their employees will see. The fact of the matter is, this is not a new issue with Bethesta,this is not a new issue with a lot of game devs. Issues like now have been going on for years and yet rather improve them, they feel to actually be getting worse and frankly, gamers of tired of the rinse/repeat shit. Yes you're going to have your typical Gamers throwing temper tantrums, just a whine. But then you're going to have those folks who are complaining because they're legit complaints and they know what they're actually complaining about. Worse when they know not to expect positive feedback and results from Devs. Everyone whining online is aimed so developers maybe come across it and see it and maybe just maybe decide to unfuck their fuckups. Then again this is Bethesda so it's highly unlikely. And with that I am also leaving. I'll check-in the game in a couple months, right now it's not worth playing.
---
It cant be that hard. I made a very large mod for 7 days To Die back in the day, and any time you consumed an item in a can or bottle, you got an empty can or bottle back. You could also dismantle ammo, melt down the lead and brass, and re-use it for more ammo later. 
---
&gt;there are some rumbling about antibiotics suppressing mutations at the moment, but I'm haven't experienced this myself.
---
I guess that has nothing to do with antibiotics, but with healing RadWorms in general, which does fuck up mutations as of right now. RadWorms wrongly boost *all active effects* since one of the last updates, and once the disease wears off, *all* those effects get toned down, including mutations, magazine &amp; bobblehead perks, and so on. 
---
Great as long as it lasts, cold turkey as soon as you 'recover'. RadWorms is the ultimate drug of the moment, but I find myself having to fast travel to Camp Venture to pick it up again more often than I'd like. I need a more reliable source for Technical Data to make it worth my while (Whitesprings Bunker is my best one, Sugar Grove may or may not have one).
---
It’s hard to ignore people like you posting every day just spamming the sub with stuff nobody cares about. If you’re leaving then just do it, don’t announce it, nobody in the world gives a shit. I come to this sub for entertainment and help not little bitch boys crying because the game disappointed them. 
---
I have a fusion generator so just scrap the purifier or 2 and maybe add a third missile launcher or change the layout of my house, I dunno, will have to ponder that for a while. 
---
Probably going alternate my next few points between that and heavy Gunner, to see how crazy I can go with it. I'm not a low hp build such as yourself, so I doubt I can come close to your numbers. Does a prime receiver exist for the GG?
---
Where was the base located? On the golf course perhaps?
---
On a Window platform, often the way to solve stuck applications is to fully re-install the offending application to clean and sort out the registry entries for this ap *then* uninstall using the applications own uninstall system if there is one. 
---
So in this case if you haven't still got Bethesda Launcher install that first, then download/install FO76 again (if you have a good internet service, the disk space, time and the inclination obviously) then use Bethesda Launcher to uninstall again.
---
If this fails and you have Windows 10, save important data and Reset the OS or reinstall fully. It's a PIA but not much else to do, unless you are familiar with editing the Windows Registry.
---
I'll assume the weight reduction doesn't go towards the gun though, right?
---
The door thing definitely happened on xbox before the patch too.
---
Yeah, actually I have all of my power tools and more. The only thing I haven't replaced is my mig welder, but it was a cheap harbor freight one so no worries on that. My wife's uncle has a very nice line feed and stick welders if I need to do any metal work. 
---
It's one of those, squeaky wheel situations. There are thousands of players and the vast majority are keeping quiet because their not having the same bad experiences. So you're just part of the quiet majority.
---
Ahhhh gotcha. Some do some don’t I think. 
---
Line in the sand doesn’t officially start until you use the terminal I believe.
---
To give just one example to start with, the story of Margie, leader of the Diehard Raider Gang, is a relatively short story but one that’s stuck with me even after leaving the Savage Divide. 
---
That would be great.
---
I usually hate caves/mines in the games, but I love those in FO76. There is not a "survivor" story that especially comes to my mind. I like the idea of female superhero group, but did not like the storyline.
---
Something I'd like to see added (though probably already known to the devs) is that the Optimized Bracers power armor mod currently appears to do nothing to reduce the AP cost of power attacks. Even with Optimized bracers on both arms, power attacks still use the same amount of AP as normal.
---
I'm so glad I decided not to play yesterday. This would have ticked me off more than most of the other bugs I've seen, lol
---
I think I'm going to keep the game off for a while until (if) they get their shit together.
---
Wanna bet money?
---
tag stuff for oil. it's in all kinds of weird things like gas cans and stuff. I was always running out of it and there's no great way to farm it outside of extractors, so I just started scrounging. Was making molotovs last night for the first time in a while, and saw I had oil for days. (Ironically I was totally short on beer bottles, as I almost never pick them up).
---
Not sure this is an "explot" since this is a well known way to repair your base due to griefers.
---
Duping is an exploit.
---
It's legitimately good to see this. I'm not hesitant to make comments on what I think's going wrong...so I absolutely should comment when ya'll get something right. This roadmap? That's a good step.   
---
General suggestions/questions? Why is it that we keep hearing talk about future STASH increases, but no one's ever addressed the possibility of more C.A.M.P budget? Is that a non-starter? Will that just never happen? Because, not gonna lie, if ANYTHING could hit the ATOM shop that would make me drop real money, it would be the ability to BUY more C.A.M.P budget.   
---
C.A.M.P items? I've got a few suggestions.   
---
Kitchen goods, pots, pans, salt mills, coffee pots, hot plates (make a hot plate as a cooking station for bonus points...I've got a generator, why am I cooking on a open flame when I have a hot plate and a giant power source?) Plates, bowls, flatware.   
---
Bathroom? Those towel stacks you see in other bathrooms, a static toothbrush and toothpaste, and bonus, a less crappy option for a toilet and some form of bathroom sink.   
---
Office? Typewriter, paper, folders, pen, pencil, desk fan. Please give us a terminal that can sit ON a desk, instead of being just on a cart that looks horrible with any reasonable build.   
---
Garage, wrenches, hammers, screwdrivers, power armor frames and pieces, weapon display racks. My power armor, at this point, is probably the only ride i'm going to have in a bethesda fallout game.  I'd love to be able to show it off when I'm not using it.   
---
Eh, I used to use an explosive Gatling gun and it did damage but that was back when the glitch was still happening that sometimes explosive damage would cause enemies to never die to guns, only to melee. So I couldn’t use it, they fixed that and then a few weeks later they nerf explosive into the ground. They reduced the damage by so much. Games where enemies are as bullet sponges as they are in fallout get boring fast. I get bosses or boss enemies like queen mirelurk and scorchbeasts, but you can’t get through a fight in the mire with less than a couple hundred bullets spent it seems, which is nuts
---
What about the grenade launcher, think of the grenade launchers!
---
So it looks like most things are back in order.  I noticed that my Bobby Pins now weigh ZERO instead of .1 or .001.  Interesting.  I wonder if that is Bethesda's way of apologizing?  
---
Bulk items now appear correctly for use in crafting and repairs.
---
I haven't noticed any enemies disappearing so far... it was really bad after Tuesday's patch as entire enemy groups would disappear before I could loot them or even check to see what items they had.  On a side note, I absolutely love how random the items that Feral Ghouls have on them.  I'm sure I could make a drinking game out of it.  One feral ghoul I killed a couple of weeks ago had a fucking TYPEWRITER on them.  strange indeed.
---
**Dodgy**, OK thanks for that, not looked at that one yet. Hmm 400+ dr I'll aim to get up to that, I've probably just not found the optimal armor pieces yet.
---
Doesn't bother me at all. That would be some SJW level indignation to be offended by someone else's enjoyment that has absolutely zero impact on me and my life. 
---
What does bother me is the literal horde of people crying about their OP weapons being nerfed. The game isn't fun any more because it actually requires skill to kill enemies? I used to literally hip shot into fields during scorch queen fights to ramp up the adrenaline perk. And it worked, because everything died. Like an orbital strike mirv with no delay, the weight of a shotgun shell, the ability to craft over 20 at a time with minimal common materials, and a 1+/second fire rate.
---
What does bother me, is being completely unable to find any meaningful content on this sub because of the hate bang coming in. Hey guys, should we all gather up an protest in one place to make our voices heard? No, everyone go pick you own street corner and make sure everyone who isn't on your side is miserable. Make your tantrum so big an so diluted that you rob other people of the ability to enjoy so much as a cup of coffee.
---
We want a Respec! Then go play the damn game. There's no level cap to artificially restrain your growth. The old builds are still viable, and even quite good. If you wanna bandwagon over to the second most OP thing, then you can simply go gain some levels and take the perks, gather the right armor, learn to play the build, etc. The next time a Nerf of buff rolls through, you'll still have the other perks to use to get on that bandwagon.
---
And don't forget to go make a new thread so that people can have even more trouble using this community for something other than a snot rag flung in their face by entitled people who don't understand online multi player game Dynamics.
---
Oh, and now being a griefer isn't a simple as decide to be a dick and shoot up someone's base with your tse. It used to take less than a minute to strip a base to the studs. A guy tried it last night, had absolutely no skill beyond his TSE handmade. He died so many times he ran out of caps before my team hopped worlds. After he got the PVP Nerf he was just annoying. Must suck to just be bad without OP TSE, but that's his problem, not mine.
---
We as both customers and Fallout fans need to hold BGS accountable for fixing issues, improving balance, and adding promised content. And they've made some real mistakes, from the original release to patches that have dropped since. And there are numerous valid criticisms of the game in its present state.
---
That said, this subreddit by its nature probably represents the most meta-oriented, beat-the-game, single-digit top-leveled percentile of players in the game. Here voice is given to at least as many drama queens and people happy to jump on the BGS-hate bandwagon and hurl insults, as to committed fans who present valid constructive criticism in anticipation of the game we know 76 can become. *That* is the community I hope 76 will enjoy when the quitters have quit and BGS has worked out the major bugs, improved balance, and released new vaults and other content.
---
I'm just saying, that for every idealist pretending 76 is perfect, there's a whiner undermining the credibility of valid criticism. So I see where the OP is coming from, thinking this sub doesn't represent his/her experience.
---
Ugh. I really hope this isn't the case. 
---
Removal (and ability to add) of Legendary Modifiers. There are a *lot* of ways that coild be implemented, but it would make the grind fun.
---
One good spawn is Tanagra town in the Mire
---
to me the best part of this game was the order of mysteries questline and story.  nothing else touched it for me.  
---
wow thats a lot of BS for 1 plan. Farming the random encounter plans is sooo boring. I have both Confederate and Union hats and neither can be learned :(
---
Did you get your stuff? i sent you a friend request
---
I used to do the same thing, until my purified water needs dropped, and I set up a purifier on water at C.A.M.P. for a while. And even then I eventually reduced to a smaller, on-dirt purifier at my current spot.
---
Not at my computer currently but I would suspect that it simply is applying the values from the perk to the gun, but I do know that weight reduction has always been buggy for this perk so who knows?  Will test when I can 
---

The only really major issue with bugs I've had for a couple patches now is the server disconnects. I'm almost guaranteed to get one every couple of hours which sucks because I really want to like workshops and to build them up as little mini bases.  Other than that my only really common bug/glitch/error I get is I play a VATS character and the percentages are totally not what they say they are a lot. 
---
I just found some in Flatwoods Red Rocket under the counter by the cash register.
---
Reddit will never be calm as 80% of any given game's subreddit are whiners
---
lvl 197, i teamed up maybe 3 times since beta, solo 99% of time
---
I'm about 80% sure I had some golfers spawn on me the other day at level like 90. 
---
After the last patch, when you're infected with Rad Worms, all your effects, including Mutations, are increased by 50% (both good and bad effects).
---
When Rad Worms wears off or is cured, there's a high chance that some effects stop working, especially Mutations. 
---
The only reliable fix I've found is logging out and back in.
---
Vats is key to hard hitting guns.
---
Or bloodied 
---
Does it actually direct you to go somewhere to advance that part of the optional quest?
---
"A lot of people" and "steady firepower" don't mean much though.  A full server of crap players with crap weapons and perks can shoot at her all day without killing her.  You aren't guaranteed success with "a lot of people" and "steady firepower" by any means.
---
Does not take skill imo lol. Just got to aim and shoot. But it takes a shitload of bullets . 
---
Just roll them at the mob and then shoot the jug
---
&gt; but you can get them before completing the quest.
---
Or at least could.  Vendor Plan update seems to have changed a few things.  Going to have to keep an eye out as I do my Vendor plan documentation this weekend.
---
In that case, your comment was completely insignificant and missed the point of the patch changes, thus your stuff is really becoming spam in my inbox by now, so i will be blocking you.I will not receive nor see any further replies.
---
Isn't BF just fiber glass? I mean that's the stuff in real life bullet proof vests isn't it?
---
No I did not haha, but all is well. I gained a lot of interesting stuff in that moss town place. I’ll add you.

You can lose items this same way to the lighthouse container when turning in bioluminescent fluid.

It’s actually a disabled quest that a bug makes it show up on your log apparently 
---
To combat this. If you leave the event. You still get charged the caps for the fast travel.
---
Yep, either that or trying to slow cap and item farming. Maybe both! The guide book even rates areas for scavenging, and some have clear advantages. Camp McClintock, for example, has almost no risk even to a lv. 2 because of the gutsys guarding it, but is a must-hit because of the military ammo bags. Lot of other useful things there, like the clipboards for springs.  
---
Keyboard to navigate windows, controller to play the game. This really isn’t a complicated procedure. 
---
The blindest are those that keep their eyes shut ...

Thanks to all for your help!

fallout 76 represents how humanity is weak for something that they like or love and keep trying and trying eventhough its hopeless. they play with my feelings man

I had one going down a railroad track once. Hilarious. 
---
fuuuuck, that sucks. the hunt continues
---
Yea I  forgot about caps.
---
This is one of the best, and simplest to implement idea's I've seen in a long damn time. 
---
I'm sure I've seen it for sale at vendors after the patch. Vendor documentation seems like a helpful endeavor to undertake. 
---
Yikes you got hurt pretty bad in life huh OP?
---
I got two Prime plans from the SQB yesterday. I made one for my handmade rifle and it does the same damage as a hardened receiver, except it says it does more damage to scorched. It doesn't say how much more. I wonder if it would stack damage on a legendary weapon.
---
Dang, you have quite a portfolio of skills! I want to spend a little less time at work this summer and more on some projects to get my skills up a bit. 
---
Just curious what level were you 
---
Only end game is farming ammo lol
---
Nah, all it takes is a couple bad players who stay a bit farther back and don't go all-in, out of laziness or desire to conserve ammo and aid items.
---
The problem is that you can get a great group together and it can all be wasted by pubs trying to leech off your work, causing it all to fail.  The algorithm assumes you don't have a batch of scrubs hanging around.
---
When you are addicted it doesn’t show it on your HUD or in the effects tab. It shows the debuffs to your SPECIAL, but doesn’t show the fact that you are addicted to a chem. 
---
I tradeda 2 shot gauss for a 2 shot missile launcher. I changed my whole spec for it and it was badass...until it broke 5 shots later. 
---
Literally just dropped it on the ground.
---
Yeah, realistically those big square bottom bottles especially would have a good chance of not breaking if they hit wrong. Or worse they just bounce back at you.
---
A Fallout game is precious. My favorite series still in development, of any series that has ever existed. And NO ONE does a Fallout-like game like Bethesda. 
---
SO - If you start to think in terms of # of Fallout games left that will come out during your lifetime, my number is 3 or *possibly* 4, before I'm too old and senile to play games. 
---
Which means, an experience like this is rare and precious and in very short supply. So, you don't get to tell me that I just shouldn't play. I WANT to play, because of the above-mentioned. 
---
I just want it to be good. Don't give Beth a pass just because criticism makes you cringe. People value this series a lot, and when something means something to a person, they want it to be as good as it can be. 
---
Ballistic fiber doesn't matter, either, military ammo bags are everywhere. Ultracite scrap, hardened mass, etc. on the other hand...
---
The solution is a powered door with a pair of pressure plates wired in.  People can get in but critters can't.
---
I'm at work for the next 2 to 3h. I'll let you know.
---
That some players are bad, but think they're good?  Not sure what to tell you if you are just assuming it's a problem with the game instead of players.
---
I always assumed you can just use the assembler in the secret base to get more of the base items.
---
agreed. open yours. this game is a mess.
---
That's my preferred type of woman. No need to commit and I can grind her for caps all day long and then go to work and tell people I'm single.
---
Does it take regular 5.56 or ultracite ammo?
---
You... can do that \_here\_ too?
---
Please?
---
Me and my friends loved this.
---
There are a lot of well known glitches and exploits.
---
Are there any perk cards for Heavy Explosive guns specifically?  All the Heavy Gun perks I remember specify non-explosive, maybe they can add a perk just for Heavy Explosive.
---
Yes a few but they don't really fight
---
That's true! I didn't even put attention to the difference in animation, but yeah, while stumbling in Power Armor from a meaty hit, I'm not spending 5 seconds admiring my shoe laces.
---
Wow Anarchy Online I remember playing that at launch. It was actually a very enjoyable game but I knew something was wrong with my extremely overpowered 2h hammer lol.
---
Yea bud. I’ll shoot you a message when I get on. 
---
Unless it was updated last night, It no longer works with the latest update. 
---
Try to see if that's the case. It could actually be beneficial to you. Tone down some of your stealth perks and see if stealth improves. If it does, then you have freed-up perk slots that you can use for something else.
---
Same here, put down a 3* rad scorpion at Whitesprings and got acid, steel and a set of standard knuckles.
---
I agree, and I'm one of the ones who keeps going back.  I'm a glutton for the abuse.
---
No, they've changed this time.
---
They just need a little more time to get their shit together.
---
When it is good, it is REALLY good, you just have to deal with the bad.
---
But I've already invested so much time in the relationship.
---
The top of Senica Rocks is a really good place for a wonderful view.  You need marsupial, power armor, and patience to get up there but the view from the top is worth it.
---
Np
---
Serendipity and Nerdrage are really good too but yeah low health build..  Evasive and Junk shield could also be incorporated. 
---

---
The enclave underarmor also clipps with the silver shroud costume too
---
You're just completely wrong. You have increased radiation resistance, (you can look at the numerical value of rad resistance any armor grants you in your armor tab). Nothing in the game makes you "immune" to radiation. You are immune to air and water born disease...not to disease from enemies.   
---
You're wearing a mask, but if a tick crawls under your suit and bites you, it'll still give you something. 
---
Except couch burning, go WVU!
---
Have a wonderful day :)
---
Fanfire?
---
Will do! If I can clearly figure it out, maybe go through two cycles to confirm, I might just start another thread for it. While it could be to encourage us to explore other areas as another reply mentions, it also seems like it is just artificially helping to slow progression in lower level players, who need the supplies more and who have more limited options for farming. 
---
You are seriously losing your own argument at this point so why even bother?
---
 And the *Gap* is what any decent ranged players use to their advantage. After all why use a *ranged* weapon if you are going to fight some one at *melee distance*  and you can fuss about +40% swing speed on a melee weapon but opted out of admitting the assault rifles that have +x% fire rate on them. And clearly in your own contradiction of ranged weapons not breaking 1k you are still under this failed impression that ranged crits cant do serious damage which now lands us back at square 1 *You don't know how to build your character* So please demonstrate some more your illiteracy of the game.
---
Are you saying save data within the game? OR the system files?
---
The clipping doesn't bother me, I hardly notice it.  But I get to wear my under armor, where as she cannot. That 3s2p is pretty helpful.
---
Yep. Somehow normal rules don't apply because *canvas bag*. Having played online gaming for a pretty long time, I've seen weird things here. People defend cheats just to oppose Bethesda. People actually create new accounts to spam hate (randomly check out how old accounts are that throwing hateposts and praise on the front page every now and then - seriously).
---
Usually people understand that decisions are made for the long term benefit of the game but there's a few complaints. Yes you balance weapons (anybody pretending that TSE wasn't ridiculous can explain why everybody wanted them and that's all dupers were selling - often for real money), you need to increase certain creatures health and damage output and lower others. Some events have increased or decreased rewards to get it right. There's a backlash every time they make a change though because the game isn't easy any more. Well easy is bad for a game they want to last.
---
Apparently everybody has their character all fully built around TSE and (even knowing this was coming) been surprised and angry they built their character around something that was going to change. They act like that was their final character build. Two months into this online game. Uh huh. Yeah that was never going to be a forever character.
---
Anyway this all started before the game was even released. Before we even saw it. It's not even a new hate for Fallout. This happens every time and It's crap to go through every time when you just want to play the damn game.
---
What I like to do is take it to a train station and leave it in a  container. Same with any ammo I can't use, or magazines I can't use.   
---
I mean personally I'd love it if they let us SELL shit shit, but that would "make sense" so they can't have that right?
---
Ah yes so dropping it to nearly no health shouldn't be punished? Come on now.

What, no Old Bay?

From all sources ive seen this is a PC only issue.
---
I’ve gone from 5 to zero before. I usually keep 10. Never know when you could hit a bunch of locks and not find any new pins.
---
May be a bit late now, but did you reach out to Bethesda about the broken helmet?  I believe some other folks here have done that.  Amazed how many went out broken.  I wonder if it was poor QA, or shipping damage.
---
You are actually seeing other people's serendipity perk proc when you get that animation. Weird glitch.
---
K. I'm not sure what the point of the comment is then? Just trying to help OP.
---
The water thing truly is idiotic. I honestly find enough random boiled water or dirty water around that I basically never have to gather it myself now, but it still feels dumb that I can only make 6 soups when I have 75 purified waters on me
---
Scrap the corn in build mode and then replant it after you fix everything.
---
I also play on Xbox, but I see plenty of bugs.  The biggest is that I can’t do anything (like check my Pip-Boy, the map, or even walk around too much) for the first 30-45s after loading into a server if I don’t want the game to hang.  I suspect the reason for this is because I’m still running an early generation of the XBone and I have to wait for everything to render before the console can handle any changes I make by actually doing anything.  You’d *think* that this would be an easy fix by just having the game do a little extra pre-rendering during any of the *three* load screens you sit through between finding a server and the start of play, but I don’t know how easy that’d be to actually code.
---
The second biggest bug I come across occurs when I try to leave a crafting station.  Normally, you’re supposed to see your character finishing the crafting animation it’s already in, then the animation for leaving the station—but the latter part never comes.  I’ll just be staring at my character repeating the crafting animation over and over until I quit to Home and relaunch the game.  I used to have that error occasionally in FO4, but it was rare.  In FO76, any play session lasting over an hour and a half will probably see it.
---
It’s only *after* that I get into server disconnects and game lag.  I’m in what feels like an eternal struggle to get my ISP to provide anywhere close to the internet access I’m paying for (most times, I’m lucky to get a third of it—“thank you” Comcast), so I can’t pin everything on shit servers on Bethesda’s end, but I’ve noticed that most of the layouts and disconnects occur in moments where a lot of things are happening, so maybe it’s a hardware thing; again, I’m running an old XBone.  Then again...maybe not.  I *still* have yet to see the end of a Messenger event, because as soon as the Mr. Handy passes the Charleston Fire Station, either my game crashes or I lose connection with the server.  Every. Time.
---
So, TL;DR, the game is buggy as hell for me, but I don’t know if it’s poor game design or aging hardware that’s at the core of it.  It certainly makes all the *other* issues I have with the game more relevant to questioning whether buying the game was the right call.
---
No, they really aren't...I've server hopped half a dozen times in multiple locations to get enough fiber to repair ONE armor piece.  Meanwhile I'm _dropping_ ultracite. 
---
😍
---
If anyone on PS4 has an extra set or even one available I would like to buy it. will be on this evening &amp; most of the weekend. 
---
I thought there was one more like acid too. I only bulk when I know I have to do the old 2 train stations and then whitesprings sell-spree. And the of course buy up all the springs. 
---
havent experienced yet, but by the looks of it, we have a winner though! 
---
While I am always honest and straight forward with customers, there are those who are feel self-entitled and no matter what you say to them, they are right. So from my experience it is best to just smile and reassure your angry customer that you have their best interest in mind and are truly working to make them happy. Kill them with kindness. It does not have to be phony as I am genuinely a happy person so my happy nature comes through in my work. Maybe this person is working really hard to keep a smile. I know I would be tempted to respond,  in kind, to the types of comments thrown at them 
---
I am seriously so happy that the comments and replies from the BethDevs have been the way they are.  At least they have not been out right condescending (from what i have seen) or have said anything like Blizz did at their conferance. But then again, I have not been as passionate or vocal as others have in expressing my feelings towards this game and Bethesda. 
---
We are all human and not perfect, but its important to remember most of us are just trying to make it through the day. 
---
This guy does things with Fallout building that picasso did paints!
---
Awesome house design and welcome back!
---
Plaque...plaque never changes.
---
I think an exception can be made in the fallout universe
---
I did exactly that.  I lost nearly 200 plastic.
---
I dont know what kind of build you are running but clearly you dont use all the bonuses you could be using if you are truly trying to maximize damage, Bloodied Gauss Rifle with Vats Crits, Adrenal Reaction, Eagle Eyes, Cover Operative, and some aid items, you can do insane amounts of damage, if at low hp, you get 600+ damage, and if crits and sneak stack the same way as in fallout 4, 2x multiplier at base, +50% from legendary effect, +32% from eagle eyes (with SIN), +40% from better crits, +50% from covert operative, +20% from certain foods, +15% from calmex, that makes a 4.07x muliplier, and you can crit every second shot if you build properly
---
Explosive build here: with the right perks nukes &amp; missile weight almost nothing. I run around with 25-30 nukes and missiles on me at any given time and remain significantly under carry weight. 
---
I have not gotten plans on every dig the entire time I have played this game. Also, only the person with the map gets the goods.
---
Isn't the OP asking for brigading in his second post?
---
Funny you say I pick on *you* in every post and yet I dont even recognize your name so ya know. And yeah I am sure you know all about clutching, *It was probably the only way you could win in pvp*
---
I have the H key bound to my mouse, so I can hit it whenever. Low health is great with unyielding if you want a cheap way to farm without chems, or add the chems/food while irradiated and even better. Born survivor isn't needed if you manage it manually.
---
I don't like the downsides of mutations, I don't even use marsupial because of the hit to intel when scrapping and birdbones hits strength. Maybe someday I'll drink those serums. We have jetpacks anyway. Same with scaly skin, ruins vats and run times when overloaded. Grounded and speed demon is decent, you have to avoid energy weps though and keep a lot of irradiated meat around if you also went carnivore. Happy camper and class freak help manage the hunger. I stayed away from anything with negatives to special stats. The dense mod for torso is good and lvl 1 fireproof together with grounded is all anti scorchbeast.
---
In pa I use emergency protocols, but there's also the medic pump if you want to play around with that. None of that works with ironclad, barbarian, junk shield though. My er without ironclad and scaly skin is over 400 out of pa because of grounded. Dr is pretty low though, it's all a trade off. You could try bolstering and auto stim with nerd rage/serendipity/blocker if you're trying to be a damage spamming sponge.
---
Yes it does, here’s a link to specifics and component cost:
---
[Prime Gatling Gun Receiver](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Gatling_gun) 
---
I honestly don't mind at all. I build on a _pond_ for fucks sake, of course other people are going to build there. If I log out at "home" I check out their build then go look at vendors/farm for ballistic scrap and then server hop until my spot places down. 
---
And if I decide I want to move? It's great? I move to another location where people often build, that's closer to where I want to be playing at the moment. 
---
It's a _resource_. Taking advantage of other people building where you build can save you hundreds of caps. 
---
And some people pay way more than $60 for this kind of service 
---
Yeah I don’t understand why this quest was so early, in the path of beginners when it’s the top pistol option.
---
Game design just has so little thought into it.
---
This is why fallout isn't really realistic. Most people have no concept of how these things really work
---
Pistols really do need some love. Either in the form of perks or letting us mod them with armor penetration to make them more viable. 
---
(Most) Ammo is actually really light to begin with, so it depends on how much and if what items you are hoarding to begin with. Saving lots of chems? 1 stim pack weighs about as much as 3000 rounds of many ammo types. Traveling pharmacy and carrying all your chems (instead of Bandolier and carrying all your ammo) is likely a more efficient use of your perks and storage. 
---
Likewise for Thru Hiker and food/drinks, although most food degrades fairly fast, people don’t usually save much long term.
---
I dont disagree, but what would you suggest? If he/she was super casual about it--people would bash em about not being professional. It's 100% a catch 22.
---
I don't understand buying bethesda games on consoles, they can barely be made sufficiently polished with all the mod support PC's can bring. 
---
👈🏼😎👈🏼
---
It's really cool that performance may be improving. I've seen a bunch of console player posts about DCs and lag so it would be great if that stopped. 
---
However,  your second paragraph is weirdly tacked on and has nothing to do with your title lol. And I disagree with it. I think the complaints about nerfs are from the vocal minority. And I don't think Bethesda made these changes to cater to calls for nerfs, which I saw very few of... I think that as developers they saw a very clear imbalance in the damage output of two-shot and explosive. I mean +100% damage should be raising alarms for anyone who has an understanding of basic math. xD
---
It's weird how a lot of people assume changes are in response to something, and just shrug off the idea that the devs have their own stats and insights and opinions.. which I imagine are what drive most changes. 
---
Besides Demo Expert, nope...
---
But Bear Arms will reduce the weight of the fat man and missile launcher. Though they made a change and now the big auto grenade launcher still maintains its full weight despite Bear Arms.....
---
This is amazing. I wonder if it's possible to build a smaller round camp
---
What have we gained by knowing this objective statement? Nothing. Are we to say that criticism of any game is invalid under the guise of 'They all start out unpolished'?
---
Wish the nukes altered the lanscape tbh. I just nuked a house, why is it still there?
---
ESO-WW is a bad speller.
---
How do you know that? :thinking:
---
I've done that run...usually I get, at most, two, that are in more remote corners that others don't know about. Two isn't even enough to fix one armor piece unless it's like level 30. 
---
Extreme Southern and Northern boundaries seem to be full of lakes/streams/mountains/clear skies and the occasional hidden stories.
---
I tried this yesterday and my orbital never came in...
---
I knew they had no chance going in.  It's at Oakland against a bad team.  Mike Tomlin is always gonna lose that game.
---
I really wish they would add multiple types of ammo, Say 5.56 vs .223 Rem. or 7.62 vs .308... Armor Pen should be tied to the round (5.56 should have slightly more armor pen vs .223).
---
I don't think the Handmade should be up-chambered to .308. It's OP enough as it is compared to the assault rifle. If anything it should ideally be switched to .223. It should be able to fire 5.56, but at a cost to durability. 
---
A Service rifle would be neat but it seems redundant as we already have a combat rifle, handmade and assault rifle? I guess make the assault rifle always automatic (it is water cooled after all) would help that issue?
---
Yes. if doing too much , too fast 
---
Beat me to it
---
happens to me too
---
Well, that's really interesting, seems you have already used the build I'm trying to get to and have found it wanting. I have my precious PA T60 for fighting the ScorchBeasts but really wanted to mostly live fast and free with a melee build, I love the feeling of being unencumbered you get in normal armor.
---
I know about the sucky Whitenight nerf (only just taken to 3\*) but Rad-X, Rad Worm also, damn! 500 DR/600 ER and you where still shredded, seems I'm going to have to re think this whole melee build if I'm going to use it beyond farming ghouls at Whitespring.
---
I agree this Stim animation is galling during a fight, only a few seconds but it's caught me out sometimes leaving me incapacitated as the damage keeps raining in. 
---
I'll have to look at all the Power Armor perks to see if they can make it feel less lumbering and slow, but I just hate the HUD and the feeling of being trapped in a metal suit, it feels claustrophobic.
---
Might be time to respec my build again... humph ;)
---
Thanks for the great comment by the way.
---
Are there any plans to change/fix workshops so that if you get disconnected you can log back into that same server and not lose everything?  All it would need is if you log back on within even 3 or 5 minutes that you still own it.  Their value isn't very high since the ore nerfs and they could be a lot more relevant.  I have on multiple occasions setup a mini base to collect specific materials (not cheap at high levels when you have to worry about scorchbeasts attacking the base) and then only gotten one or two loads before an inevitable DC.
---
And on a similar side note - I can barely setup a few turrets before a scorchbeast comes and blows up everything.  Other monsters are fine, maybe just extend the timer to build defenses for scorchbeast attacks.  Thanks!
---
I'll take a look at that thank you :) 
---
please. do go on .
---
Yeah, most of my caps have been spent on plans. I've spent a little on serums from other players, and a bit on fast travel, but I've been thinking it might be worth buying springs, screws and ballistic fiber to reduce the grind for those items, now that I have most of the major plans that I'll need for awhile. Most of my group thought I was crazy to suggest it, but what else am I going to do with 1,200 caps a day? 
---
I would argue that it's about the journey, not the destination. 
---
Plenty of movies have a clearly identified ending. What's interesting is how they get there. 
---
Only way I know of "in game", would be by deleting character. I'm referring to going into game save data via PS4 settings category on dashboard, selecting 76, then deleting the save data. Which like I said is basically only your game settings. Wasn't something I was expecting to help me back when I was getting the blue screens a lot for about 2 weeks. But Bethesda suggested it, so I tried it. Don't think it did anything for me, but who knows. 
---
Yeah you don't even need TSE, I killed two scorchbeasts today at Whitesprings with an unimproved Gauss Rifle. The endless robots drew their fire almost completely, but the damage I was doing was reasonable. 
---
Just kidding. Exploit it all you want. That's what everyone does.
---
No, the maps never guaranteed plans - they are (well, were until the last patch) a good source for plans, but still subject to the benevolence of RNGesus.
---
Better go SuperMutant hunting then... :P 
---
I've been trying to get the sword from Whitespring for the Blade of Bastet - will have to try harder and follow some of the tips on here for getting it!
---
If you built your character for meta, and then the meta gets changed, what were you really expecting?
---
Go do melee meta now if meta is your thing, but keep in mind why tse got nerfed in the first place. 
---
However, the very fact that tse and now melee is so good is because of fo76's inability to build game mechanisms for casual play. All the regular gear fairly weak with barely any mods or upgrades avalible without farming, low durability, lots of junk scraps needed for repairs, and fighting boss creatures or luck spawn legendary enemeies are the only way to get better gear with low certity that any of it will be loot that fits or improves your characters build. 
---
Fallout 76 expect you to grind. Pointlessly. And the fact that there is very little storage or return in vendor caps for all these items is the key factor. Otherwise, the players would be able to trade spare loot items for something that fits their character better.  But 76 isnt facilitating any of that. 
---
Thats why im quiting.
---
standing around with your sledge and wondering why the queen isn't dying...
---
Awesome, thx!
---
&gt;Sentinel 
---
Hmm, another great suggestion, something else for me to look into. I have to say non PA armor seems the most complex system to get into, so many options, alternative types to try out, all with different built in perks that change the set as a whole.
---
Same happened to me but I don’t know if it was this last patch. It’s definitely gotten worse with the latest patch but sneak has been hit or miss for a little while. I just assumed I was being followed by enemies who spawned underground. I have to switch to an entirely different area of the map to lose caution and danger. 
---
One thing I did notice with this patch is as I am in danger sneak mode as soon as I enter an area with enemies they are alerted and tracking me down. Really sucks because I designed my character to be a stealthy sniper.
---
Even if they have no plans to add them now, I doubt they would be allowed to confirm/deny anything related to future MTX.
---
I totally understand you. And yeah, this game has more years to come and i hope (and i do think) that they get their shit together at some point. It is a process... and as you said previously, they have taken extreme damage, starting with the canvas bag scandal and with the game itself. They simply have to get things right, or they’ll loose a lot of their gamer base. And yeah, only my love for fallout let me play this game for so long... for now, Iam either doing camp builds in 76 or looking into f4 again, I bet Preston is worried bc he hasn’t see me for such a long time lol
---
I’m well aware that you can get them in the game. My point still stands that in game the sources of them are rare/infrequent. Finding them in containers is like 1:200, and quests... depends on the quests, and they aren’t grindable, just incidental. Static world spawns are limited; I know of about 6 off the top of my head, and if everyone suddenly wants them those 6 are going to be missing frequently (just look at fusion cores from generators/PA after the last few patches; I went from seeing them almost every time to finding them maybe 1/8th of the time)
---
Fear is the path to the dark side…fear leads to anger…anger leads to hate…hate leads to suffering.
---
I had server disconnect issues from day one of this game. I would also get the corrupted memory error on PS4, the ce-34878-0 one from Fallout 4. Honestly the only problem I have had is server disconnects and game crashes. Everything else i was willing to look past. But when I play and get the same workshop after a disconnect just to lose it again due to server disconnect, it becomes quite frustrating. Rip. 
---
Did you note the level of Luck stat on each person?
---
Yeah, I'm mainly taking the piss out of all the people defending Bethesda's literally unending fuckups as if they were a tiny development team as opposed to a massive corporation not putting any of their boundless resources to good use in fixing the game.
---
You may like Eagle Eyes and Cameleon.
---
Honestly, I think it comes down to pistols not really having much of a place in the world of 76. In real life, pistols are useful in tight quarters and pack enough punch for well-placed shots to kill almost anything, but the spongy enemies, fantastical weapon and ammo-carrying capabilities, and OP melee at the heart of 76 just doesn't leave us with any good reasons to use pistols, even as a sidearm.
---
Pistols would make more sense in a game with less spongy enemies, which as it happens I'd like to see. I'd also be entirely onboard with letting perk points put into rifles or heavy guns equally buff corresponding ballistic or energy pistols, since that would highlight their role as a supplementary sidearm.  However, as long as we can carry dozens of bigger guns and thousands of rounds of ammo, there's just not much incentive to empower pistols.
---
I haven't checked damage numbers to see if pistol damage per caliber make real sense compared to their long-barreled counterparts; if not that should be corrected, but bear in mind shorter barrels do equal lower accuracy and bullet energy up to a point depending on the cartridge. 
---
Incorrect. I'm on xbox and it's happening to me, and there's been multiple replies in this post across all platforms.
---
Exact same build. Exact same problem. Workin on my brawler melee guy because my sniper is so damned broken right now.
---
 Had this exact issue. No marsupial perk, we switched servers, then I'm recieving the Strange in Numbers perk without having the card selected. Which I'm not thrilled about because of the weird stutter while jumping.
---
I can drop a wooden wall to low health accidentally with a single shotgun blast. No it shouldn't.
---
since the patch, I have had more syringer, flare guns, and drills drop than I care to think about. Get half a chub seeing a 3 star walking around, drop em, and.................damn.
---
Scorchbeast Queen flying off the map and never coming back??? Happens all the time. Also what about removing the ultracite plans from her loot pool now that they are given to everyone for free?
---
Nearly 400 hours in. Never seen mothman of any kind. A few days ago I was walking along and there was a WHOOSH! next to me.think that was one but was gone.
---
 They are in the Mire. I see em' but I leave em' alone, I leave the Hermit Crab alone. I don't kill Possums and most other small animals either. RP baby.
---
The woman responder who trapped herself in a Supply Chamber at Morgan Town Airport. Scorched were clawing their way in, she had no way out and her supplies were very limited

Cool.

---
All interesting suggestions, looks like I've a lot to learn. It is interesting so I'm not complaining.
---
Same. Work 80-100 hours a week and I just want to play fallout.
---
But I spend so much time repairing, managing inventory and doing routes for caps that I’m just burned out until the devs rework the mechanics to let me actually play the game.
---
Totally great that people are having fun and I’m sure I would if I could sesh out for 2-3 hours, but I often only have an hour. In that hour, I found myself doing the logistics and setting up my next adventure for over half of my playtime. 
---
Eventually started getting ready/building/upgrading one day and then doing stuff the next. Finally took a look at that and re-downloaded FO4. Scratches the itch.
---
Fatman doesn’t need an apostrophe, here. You aren’t showing ownership, it’s just plural.
---
Huh? Seems like melee is the only thing that is not broke in this game
---
I never said everything was fine. My point is that the game isn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be. 
---
Ah, you’ve met my ex-wife then?
---
I'm telling you, Molotov cocktails work. Anytime I had a problem and I threw a Molotov cocktail, boom! Right away, I had a different problem.
---
Central Southern border and the NE corner all the way down to the bog are some of my favorite areas. 
---
God I hope one of the devs read this. I have always scratched my head and facepalmed as to why they are so underpowered and underutilized. The damage values need some serious work. I was over the moon when they said they’re reworking plasma/energy weapons. Let’s hope ballistic/nuclear are on their radar as well. 
---
I think that is what will happen in the future, hopefully, they are not overly expensive and allow extensive modding.  
---
Pls
---
&gt; I'm not spending 5 seconds admiring my shoe laces.
---
LOL, I do wonder why that particular action had to be so... realistic.
---
People loving the game? Wow look how awesome and supportive this community is.
---
People hating the game? Must be brigading.
---
&gt;P.S. The more you create accusations and fervor over a slight change, the more you empower YouTubers to just attack the game more.
---
P.S. The more Bethesda manages to screw up slight changes, the more they empower YouTubers to just attack the game more.
---
Danse Macabre by Saint-Saens would apropos to the setting as well. 
---
Yeah this. They stand in between me and the vendor and jump around. I've been here 30 seconds, you can't wait that long?
---
About 100 levels over my 2 friends that deal twice as much damage as I do. After level 80, the only thing that's going to give you a damage advantage over other players is gear. Sounds like you're searching for something that isn't there
---
Not so much a bug but when I hit "Repair All" on my CAMP device, can it also use materials to repair things that aren't totally broken?
---
I have walls and doors that have very little "health" left on them and no way to repair them that I know of.  Being able to hit that one CAMP device and repairing everything back to 100% would be nice.
---
I get where you are coming from but they need to break as soon as they do because it’s OP as hell, even with the shitty durability. I use my explosives for PVP all the time and they should break after 5-8 shots because if they didn’t I would literally wreck everyone over and over again. 
---
I’ve got a two shot MIRV, two shot triple barrel launcher, double explosive radius and rank 5 explosive perk. I have been extremely successful in PVP against all sorts of try hards with the best endgame stuff. What they need to do if they haven’t is fix explosive weapons, they are too damn strong and glitchy, especially shotguns. It’s just ridiculous. I was tearing through people like paper with my two shot lightweight explosive LMG but I haven’t played so I’m curious as to what my DMG will look like post nerfs
---
Dude I think you are missing the point, the TSE still absolutely crushes normal weapons
---
Ok
---
Could be worse. Those poor ghouls who run at you screaming bloody murder and fall down right in front of you... I just can't take them seriously with their little Ranger shorts and all.
---
Also, you can't be in Power Armor. Just fyi in case someone else doesn't understand
---
In FO4 missiles did minor impact damage and major explosion damage. I assume it’s the same in FO76.
---
My bet is it’s only applying the 20% to the impact damage... but something else must be funky if you’re seeing big difference without Demo Expert
---
Clear your cache. Also stop watching porn on the system you use for gaming. You're welcome.
---
Grognak and the Ruby Ruins for the WIN!
---
&gt;You are seriously losing your own argument at this point so why even bother?
---
you just did. and didn't even bother explaining why I'm "losing", but ok.
---
&gt;And the Gap is what any decent ranged players use to their advantage.
---
no argument here. problem is that there is no gap for a decent melee pvper, they force ranged to fight up close, so your point is kinda moot.
---
more on point though, a """gap""" is no excuse for a weapon being able to output 15K+ damage with a half-assed build. *that's op*.
---
&gt;but opted out of admitting the assault rifles that have +x% fire rate on them
---
because the point wasn't the attack speed bonus itself, but rather that melee can fill up the crit bar about as fast as any semi-auto ranged. about a post ago you made it sound like crits are something only ranged can take advantage of because of how fast they can refill the bar, which is untrue.
---
&gt;And clearly in your own contradiction of ranged weapons **not** breaking 1k
---
I said struggling. that means it's possible. "not" implies otherwise. I never said that.
---
&gt;you are still under this failed impression that ranged crits cant do serious damage which now lands us back at square 1
---
not upwards of 15K. which melee can dish out per regular, non-crit swing. and that was square one, that melee is now op compared to ranged. which it is.
---
I have seen this same thing.  I completed it wearing the outfit and it came back as a mission on my next login.
---
Yeah, just running around I do randomly get hurt without any logical reason in sight.
---
Ditto, those pebbles and twigs are killers!  
---
There's still plenty of people offering all serums for 500 caps on PC and lower for console. Most sellers also offer discounts if the buyer provides the flux. 
---
The player-to-player serum cost is more closely related to the ingredient cost (flux) than the NPC vendor cost. Things could change, but there isn't really sign of serum inflation. 
---
If my objective statement is meaningless and we learn nothing from it than the same case can be said for objective criticism. My point is not in giving a pass but instead in making the objective statement that 76 isn't as bad as everyone is saying. 
---
True. But that poor Flatwoods fellow was shoved in there by raiders after the bombs. Billy was shoved/hid in his refrigerator before the bombs fell.
---
What about the issue where you contract Rad worms, and then when it expires or is removed - none of your mutations work anymore?  that's the most annoying one and is new since the last patch.
---
I've never used mods on this one. Let me check my settings when I get home and I'll try to upload a picture.
---
 Yes please. I've lost two Blades of Bastet (Buddy gave me his) because of this. Almost lost my favorite legendary spear due to this. For the love of Crom, fix this ASAP!
---
they are a complete pain in the butt.  i have only ever successfully taken one down with help.  solo'ing them is a nightmare.  
---
Now if these were only kind of issues the game had, there would be a lot less drama.
---
You're done? Cool, I can finish this with some *actual* facts then.
---
- firstly, I do not in fact have a mule myself. I don't even have a second character. So regardless of anything else, you are *certainly* wrong in saying I'm cheating or rationalising it.
---
- there is also a limit on inventory space. The stash itself bypasses this.  Either you apply the same argument and declare the stash itself to be cheating, or you must admit this "bypassing the limit" argument is, at the absolute minimum, insufficient.
---
- this game is *chock full* of perks etc that bypass other game mechanics.  Bypassing something does not mean cheating.
---
- many other similar games explicitly allow mules. This is called precedent, and is relevant.  As far as I am aware, no other major online game explicitly allows item duping using recognised glitches.  They are not the same.
---
- Beth have not, to my knowledge, explicitly stated muling is cheating or otherwise. Since they will always be the final arbiter, any conclusion of yours or one is therefore conjecture.
---
Who knows, maybe your opinion will turn out to match Bethesda's.  But for now, it most definitely is absolutely nothing more than opinion.  THAT is a fact.
---
Power armor challenge!!
---
Where are Senica rocks again? I have marsupial and no fall damage. Do i need the power armor? I have no jetpack. 
---
Alan Watts? Is that you?
---
Pointing out the important things ;) 
---
This game fails to function properly for the "average 50%" just as much as the folks who play it 24-7.  Folks aren't debating the minutiae of obscure gear tweaks, they are debating why the servers keep crashing and deleting all their stuff and why patches reset old bugs.  Like what is this
---
Same. What system you on?
---
It went away after awhile and many crashes of course.
---
Replaced by an Armor one identical to it for a bit, but the most fun new bug is dying then coming back resoawned toa blacks screen with power armour ui frame.
---
Think finding that shitty brown, blending into the background, bad full of everything you just spent hours grinding for was bad?   Do it in the dark.
---
That was fucking fun.  Lost it all, of course.
---
When these people will realize making us lose everything on death isn't fun?  
---
Not everyone wants a hardcore fallout- most of us don't even want a pvp one for Christ sake.
---
How practical is it though? Personally I feel like I'd be more accurate with just the stock sights. Doesnt it come loose each time you fire and constantly need to be readjusted?
---
Pretty much every ridge in the savage divide

What type of shotgun is it? I had a quad combat shotgun before and it was beast with my build until I screwed up and sold it 😔 Anywho arm pen is a useless stat unless you are doing strictly pvp as not that many enemies really have armor on (Least not at the golf course haha) and reload speed can be decent-ish but is better to be swapped out for something else like *faster crit fill* 
---
Take the T3 quad combat shotgun I had, it had quad ammo capacity (32 rounds) +33% vats accuracy and +10% damage while aiming. Imo it was a God roll haha. It was beast though. Criplling enemies then blasting their faces off. I run 15 perception on my ranged builds cause it increase your aim in vats when you add the +15 perception from a unyielding set you get 30 perception man +33% accuracy in VATS from the gun I could literally cripple scorch beast from the ground forcing them to land without really trying. The range was beautiful. I could explain the pros and cons all day man but if there is any advice I can give you it is *experiment with builds and armors and mutations, But most importantly just have fun doing it. Yes this game gets frustrating at times and it will feel like your build is going nowhere, But believe me when I say it all comes together in the end and the reward is worth the frustration*
---
+25% dmg? I like. Currently using the speedy receiver for obvious reasons, but my new holy Grail appears to be that prime receiver! My only fear is the corresponding need for ultracite 5mm. I'm assuming that the only extra needed mat for crafting this ammo is the ultracite? And the ammo plans of course. Or does the ammo unlock via finding the receiver? I've yet to find any prime stuff for any of my current kit.
---
that last line paints a vivid picture
---
I think you are missing the point. As a end game Legendaries weapons, they should absolutely crushes normal weapons. Else, why should we farm them?
---
I’m only level 70 and I just managed to complete the nuke mission. It was really tedious and took a lot of my supplies but doable. 
---
I do have full X-01 PA that took a lot of hoarding and junking to build. I’m also terrible with perk cards and pretty much never use them in a meaningful way. 
---
I didn’t finish most of the main missions until level 60 or so. My play style is to push out to higher level areas to see if I can manage then go back to lower level areas and explore every nook and cranny. You can get a lot of stimpacks and ammo that way and there’s a whole lot of stuff to explore. 
---
Criticism is subjective.
---
Thank you for the list.
---
Some Bug items to add to you list:
---
* Kill a Mob and:
---
 * It falls with rag-doll physics, and poof just gone, no meat pile nothing but you do see the blood from the fight.
---
 * As it falls you see an inventory on the mob to be looted.  Hits the ground the corpse has no form of interaction.  i.e. no swirling arrows, nothing just like its a non lootable prop in the world.  (yeah I know, loot faster /s)
---
* Cap Stash - The stash item remained like a container after looting.  Next server hop or next day the cap stash is not there.
---
* Door close / shut - Game shows door closed, you click to open, door instantly is open and then slams shut.
---
* Randomly take damage - Just walking along, nothing around and bang got damage.  Didn't fall, didn't get shot, no mobs.
---
* Camp Defiance - Outside steps going up to entrance cause player to hang, have to hop over first step.
---
* Queen flies to an un-reachable location (off player reachable map).
---
* Flip lighter gives spring, but gold plated flip lighter does not.
---
* Inventory magically getting items.  i.e. I have 8 power cores.  I looted two, but burned through 3, but later I have 16 in inventory and 6 of them are stacked with the same power level.
---
* Spam (high speed) Crafting can cause serious server lag and crash.  https://redd.it/a3mdtp
---
* Spam World Interactions can cause lag and crash.  https://redd.it/a3o9el
---
* Mothman Museum - Locked door when unlocked detaches from wall and lays on floor.
---
I may be a bit late to the party but this was a long thread to read
---
Suggestion : remove the ability to camp in white spring 
---
Old ass gun does less damage than a nuclear weapon. 
---
“It just works.” - Todd Howard
---
Situational. I think that's the key. Its decent for specific use cases such as this.
---
Well, your ideas are fucking phenomenal.
---
I haven't seen an unruly golfer since launch. lol
---
considering how bad things are, your reaction is the very definition of downplaying as "everything's fine".
---
I mean, you just did it again. "the game isn't as bad as everyone says", that's gotta be a joke.
---
If your entire shotgun blast takes a wooden wall to low health then perhaps you shouldn't be fighting that close to someone elses camp
---
I thought that was the end... But there's others that only make sense of they were afterwards.
---
That's not even what I said. 
---
I understand what you mean, but the solution doesnt have to be perfect. It just has to be better than now--and a timer would at least be better than nothing. 
---
It's crazy that we can't upgrade legendary weapons/armor as we progress in level.  Such a disappointment.
---
Ah. Interesting. Good question. My luck was at least 17, and I did get a plan. I'll have to ask the others. They did most of the digging. 
---
(The latest patch](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al0bl3/fallout_76_patch_notes_january_29_2019/) changed the legendary effects of two shot and explosive to be 25% and 20% of base weapon damage where it pre-patch was 100% and 100% of weapon damage.
---
That coupled with changing the Demolition expert perk to max 60% explosive damage bonus, compared to max 100% damage bonus pre-patch made the top-damage ranged weapons considerably weaker.
---
Melee is still about as strong as you remember it and uses none of those legendary mods or the perk and hence wasn't affected by those changes. 
---
So your perception of melee being the most powerful is even moreso true post-patch.
---
"Significant  commitment to SPECIAL and perk allocations to make them usable (Bear  Arms 3, Ordnance Express 3, Stabilized 3, Demo Expert 5, Gunsmith 5,  etc.)"  
---
I mean, every build requires significant investment in points .Gunsmith 5 is needed for EVERY weapon build, in my opinion.
---
I really like those creepy pink forests in the bog. I tried to get a photo of those plants exploding but i always take to long to get pictures i like. 
---
I agree it should be moddable. My junk also shares your junk's unfortunate experiences with explosive weaponry.
---
I'd like to see unmodded and non-Legendary Railway Rifles have at least as much armor penetration as Legendary Anti-Armor guns firing regular bullets. A damage buff might make sense too. That said, ammo weight should also be high (I don't recall what it is currently).
---
At any rate, variety is good, and RR should be both moddable, and a rifle for perk purposes.
---
Nice edit. 
---
I wonder how many people you've "greifed."
---
Thanks
---
i dont want to set the world on fire, no really, i dont.
---
No wonder they are close to bankruptcy ...
---
Here are 2 things I would like to see fixed:
---
Earth Mover: Please make it give you ore, like it says, rather than scrap.
---
Earth Mover: Ignition Cores still seem to require being make one at a time and dropped on the floor to craft.  
---
Quality of Life items:
---
* In Game Bug / Player / Suggestion Report - Please give us the ability to report bugs or players.  Make it take a log snapshot and maybe an auto image of what we are reporting.
---
* Display preview of the item especially if its a Plan.  Plan: Modern Couch - how do I know what it looks like?
---
* Plan should have same name as what they make.  Some plans do not have same name.
---
##Perk / SPECIAL:
---
* Ability to downgrade. i.e. break a level 3 into a level 1 and a level 2 card.  Some of us upgraded too early.
---
* Respec Options:  After level 50 you can do the choice of 1 card or move one point, but also, at any time (after 50) you can sacrifice a card for ability to move one point. Maybe through a workbench.
---
 * 1 point per level of card. i.e. level 3 card 3 points, level 5 card 5 points.  This would be a good way for us to be able to get rid of unused / duplicate cards.
---
* Scrapper Perk - Should give screws and springs from scrapping weapons - and allow you to break down ammo into its elements (at a loss of course).
---
* Makeshift Warrior/Gunsmith Either buffed (90% slower wear) or Rank reduction to 3 Ranks (20/40/60%)
---
* Perception - Should increase ranged damage like Strength does for Melee.
---
##Team/Friends:
---
* Map - Have team mates show as different color dot instead of the default.  Also maybe a separate 3rd color for friends as well.
---
* Friends / Block list - It should be an either / or, not possible to be both. A person on your friends list should not be block-able.... 
---
* Block List - show a list of people blocked, See above.
---
* Team Workshop should allow fast travel to anyone on the team.
---
##Key-binds:
---
* Allow change of Map and Menu buttons.  i.e. Esc key set to just pull up menu, and M for Map.
---
* Allow change of Grenade key-bind (G in every other game, but long press E here)
---
* Re-work the key-binds so that there aren’t 3 different ways to go back. Currently tab, Esc and space bar are all used to go back in menus depending on which screen you are on
---
* ability to rebind any keys... not everyone uses QWERTY
---
* Mouse Wheel button to bring up favorite menu.
---
* Key-bind for going directly to photo-mode.
---
* Show us and allow us to change the secondary key assigned to a command, and allow us to split up currently merged keys. For example, to enter workshop mode or third person view, V and Mouse3 are both assigned to this. The key-binds screen only shows you that V is assigned, and if you change V to do something else, Mouse3 will do that too. So in this example, we should be able to set V and Mouse3 to do independent things and also be able to set different keys for workshop and third person.
---
* Ability to change the interact keys.  Trying to Reload my weapon in combat with R but now I am in a corpses inventory swap, rush to get out and hit Esc, now I am at the map, have to hit esc again.... hope I am not dead.
---
##UI:
---
* Fast Travel - Do the "enemies nearby" and "over encumbered" checks before verifying if I want to fast travel.
---
* Condition indicator for presently equipped weapon.  Yes it shows when your at 10% but would like to see an ever present one.
---
* Enable the mouse and keyboard so that menus can also be accessed that way
---
* Power Armor HUD - Give option to use default HUD.
---
* Make glow-sights / reflex dots visible while cloaked (chameleon)
---
* Terminal - Loading holo-tapes: List in alphabetical order.  And when at  a terminal like supply drop console, put the required tape at the top.
---
##Inventory / Stash
---
* Inventory sort option by total weight rather than by the individual item in the stack.
---
* Inventory summary of weight by category page your on.
---
* General sorting / logic
---
 * Sort option for most recently looted (help with notes or holotapes)
---
 * Sub-categories in aid for medicine, food, ingredients, chems and meds
---
 * Sub categories in misc. for for Holo-tapes, notes, quest items etc.
---
 * Sub-categories in weapons for weapon type (pistol, rifle etc.), melee and grenades
---
 * Sub-categories in apparel for armor, clothes, power armor
---
 * Power Armor chassis - Way to see which chassis is which in our inventory.... show what armor is on the chassis.
---
* Add some color or icons to better differentiate types of loot (all drinks with a glass icon, all food with a plate icon)
---
* Separate storage for Vanity stuff so it doesn't count against your stash limit.
---
* Separate containers for different type of items with separate stash limit. Aid / Ammo / Weapons / etc.
---
* Ability to set inventory limits. i.e. Scrap Steel never store in stash over 300.  I don't need 1000.
---
* Highlight new items in your inventory. When you are picking up so many holo-tapes and items, all while trying to listen to them and communicate with team mates it is so easy to miss something crucial you picked up and then not remember the name of the item.
---
* Ability to loot all from my stash.
---
* Ability to loot all from my stash by category. i.e. go into Junk tab and loot all will just do that category.
---
* Naming convention - 
---
 * Junk components should be named consistently across the various inventory and crafting interfaces. They should sort in a logical, alphabetical order, and I shouldn't need to memorize alternate item names. Screws should be under S for Screws, not L for Loose screws; Acid should be under A , not W; Adhesive under A, not E; etc. Just get rid of all the preceding descriptors and add scrap to the end where appropriate. Raw leather should be leather scrap and so forth.
---
 * Armor - Name should start with common info Type - Body Part - Mods    So Metal Arm Left pocketed  Same with power armor pieces.
---
 * Weapons - Name should start with common info. Type - Mods   So, Combat Shotgun piercing.
---
* Weapon / Armor Re-naming.  Allow me to make the name for the item.
---
* Storage box with 50lb weight limit (not stash related) that can be accessed across characters.
---
* Rifle weight needs to be dramatically reduced or give us a perk card that does this.
---
##Crafting/Scrapping/Repair:
---
* Cooking - Recipes should allow use of higher level water.  i.e. if recipe calls for dirty water, you can use boiled, and purified water.  If it calls for Boiled, you can use purified water... but not dirty, etc.
---
* Adhesive - Spoiled Fruit and Vegetables should be usable to craft this... go ahead touch a spoiled fruit or veggie... very sticky.
---
* Ability to Scrap Ammo to get Lead, Gunpowder and Steel.
---
* Some junk items get scrapped but they themselves are used for crafting stuff.  Give recipe to re-craft that item or allow flagging to not scrap.
---
* Repairing an item should not take materials that were not required to make it.  Leather armor level 20 takes ballistic material to repair, but it doesn't take any to create the armor.  It's easier to just make new armor considering the ballistic material is hard to find.
---
* Stash - Ability to Drop / Destroy item directly from the menu.
---
* Bulk Crafting - Making bullets, Boiled water, Mutt Chops? - how many do you want to craft then just do one ka-ching.
---
* Repair - Reward those that Upkeep Armor/Weapons - Make it so the "rare" materials needed to upkeep your gear cost less.
---
 * 99%-60% = 0 Ballistic Fiber/Screws/Nuclear Material
---
 * 59%-30% = 1 Ballistic Fiber/ 1-2 Screws etc Rare Mats
---
 * 29%-10% = 2 Ballistic Fiber/ 2-4 Screws etc Rare Mats
---
 * 9% - Broken = Same cost as to build a new item
---
When crafting - Show me how many of the item I am crafting that I have already.  i.e. Ammo, Food, drink etc.
---
##C.A.M.P.:
---
* Welcome Mat - Make it a fast travel location... so I can show up where I want on my Camp.  Like in FO4.
---
* CAMP items affect camp - This gives a practical application to specific items in our camp to benefit us with.
---
 * Nuka cola fridge? Nuka cola's -&gt; ice cold nuka cola's.
---
 * Crates, etc... reduced weight of x item type in stash.
---
 * Television playing? Give us well tuned/rested if we stay at our camp for long enough.
---
* New container type - Gift / giveaway - Anything you put in there someone can take without repercussions.
---
* Ability to display out collection -
---
 * Power Armor.
---
 * Display cases for - Bobble Heads, Teddy Bears, Gnomes, etc.
---
* Turret - Improve range.  Mobs are shooting my base but turrets are not returning fire.
---
##PvP:
---
* PvP - Griefing - PvP needs a flag.  I'm in or I'm out.   Or on their own server.... or if they keep attacking you when you do not return attack, give the non PvP a damage shield, that returns FULL damage to the offender.
---
* Revenge needs limits - Infinite revenge spawning needs a rework. Killing a wanted person should not flag you as a revenge candidate.
---
* Formerly Wanted players should be forced to respawn at Vault 76.
---
* If you initiate combat via "slap" you should wave your rights to revenge if you lose and must respawn at your camp, and if no camp forced respawn at Vault 76.  If you lose, you lose.
---
* Passive flag - Make it real.  If I flag passive, I cannot damage anyone, and they cannot damage me. 
---
* When a teammate is flagged for PvP teammate camp or workshop should not attack.
---
##General:
---
* Shotgun - Condition deteriorates too quickly.
---
* Ability to change game settings when server is off-line.  So we can make changes to resolution, quality, and key-binds during down time.
---
* Atomic Shop - Show both Male and Female models in the outfit, or provide a Preview with your present character selected.
---
* Make Train stations/Red Rocket Fast Travel Cheaper/No Cost
---
* Power Armor - 
---
 * Allow fist weapons to be usable.
---
 * Should take lowest Fusion Core when refilling.
---
* End Game content that doesn't force Power Armor.
---
* Hazmat Suit that you can wear with Armor.
---
* A way to see recently killed / loot able corpses in all the mire and detritus of combat.  Have lost way to many Boss mobs in the mess.
---
* More visible paper bag from death.  That bag needs to glow in the dark please.
---
* Gas Masks / Power Armor Chassis on your favorites wheel
---
* Photo Mode - Poses for when your sitting on your beloved couch.
---
* Holo-tapes should use the Volume from Voice not Effects.  (its a voice we are trying to hear not gun shots)
---
The real problem is we'll never know when it's fixed since a patch a week later might reset all the bugs again anyway.  It's like fighting someone who has a time matchine.
---
I do that. But I shouldnt have Tom it should fix what it can and leave the rest unfixed. 
---
Keep an eye on whitesprings. If there's a lot of higher lvl people there they are normally grinding it and go round in circles killing the mobs. Just sit on the outskirts near where you need to go and sneak in quietly. That's how I did it anyway lol
---
Can you be more speficic? Im too damn critical about photos. Takes me forever everytime to make one and not deleting it later. 
---
That's a false equivalency. Not as bad doesn't mean there aren't problems, it just means its not as bad as everyone is making it out to be.
---
I play on PC and have had nowhere near the claimed issues. I have had a few DCs and loading screen issues, but it's been much better recently. I did experience the regenerating health bug once and had the stretched PA body once. The server seems more stable recently, but it also feel more laggy. I notice this most when my initial swings with melee "miss".
---
What I think part of it is, many people treat all issues like bugs. If you combine those claims with the people that are spreading false info, it makes it seem much worse than it actually is. There are and have been many bugs, but not all of them are game-breaking and some require specific things to happen that not everyone does. The auto scrapping bulk with "scrap all" is a good example. By design, bulk was solely for buying and selling junk. Since it also doesn't save stash weight (except aluminum and lead) you would only have bulk on you if you were selling or buying. If you are buying to use, you would scrap it to use. If you are bulking to sell, I believe they expected you to bulk and sell right away since there is no benefit to storing bulk. The point being: If used by design, it's a non-issue. Since actual players do all sorts of things that may or may not make sense, it was determined that bulk was being scrapped. A bug most players could go without ever noticing, but a bug just the same. 
---
It's back up now
---
Like the idea of a Molotov made with Nuka Cola adds rad damage, quantum even more so etc. 
---
People without the map do get a few junk items, but they have to be really close to the person digging. 
---
I mean if I'm honest here, they just put a \_massive\_ cap sink in, with the fucking \_idiotic\_ raise in plan costs. Letting us save 20 caps traveling across the map to hit an event and walk around isn't exactly going to off-set that. 
---
Huh, that’s a good deal for a controller.
---
Then why are you wasting your time on this sub? Get a life dude.
---
I don't even...
---
wow.
---
And?
---
it's precisely as bad as everyone is making out to be. that's the point.
---
Not sure if it was just my imagination but sneaking around seemed to prevent those plants from exploding all the time.
---
Fanning the hammer for rapid fire
---
Never had problems with them with heavy tse even after the nerf. But fot melee yes, its pain
---
I'm 102. We had several high levels. He'd taken one down earlier without much problem. We all beat on it with everything we could throw, and it took the entire time to get her down to almost half health. Sometimes I would hit her, then see her health tick back up a bit. 
---
Sorta kinda. This is a small part of it, the bigger issues are with their core business rather than just some games not selling well.
---
This has happened a few times over the years when they have tons of extra inventory and are just looking to unload it. At least they're not giving it away with EVERY purchase like they did with Auto Assault many years ago.
---
Can you please remove the poor HDR/unsharpen mask filter? (Not talking about actual HDR for Xbox/PS4 Pro but the type that results in the weird highlights around certain objects - try looking at the C.A.M.P. model when placed on the Whitesprings golf course grass and you should see what I mean)
---
On top of this, I would love if interior shadows rendered the same as Fallout 4. This ambient occlusion that is lighting all interiors makes the game very unrealistic looking.
---
Honestly on this particular gun it's effectively a toy. It being a .22 the recoil doesn't really effect the zeroing much. I have to re-zero it maybe every 500 rounds or if I take it off the rail.
---
Mind you this is a custom job from a damn near master gunsmith he made on a lark so I can't speak as to how a factory stock on performs from experience.
---
I can tell you the Ruger MKIII he attached a cheap red dot to has only been zeroed once or twice in the last two years with about a thousand rounds put through it. It's just like a rifle, you compensate for the drop, ammo, conditions, etc. Just a little more so with the smaller calibur and shorter barrel.
---
&gt; also observed over the past two days that mineral veins, the ones attached to mountain walls and such, are no longer respawning properly.
---
This is part of that change they did for the Cap  Stash.  They are only lootable once per day.  Wood on the ground is the same as well as the mothman eggs.
---
Personally I do not like this particular change.
---
Have him restart it in safe mode or whatever it's called, then rebuild databases, it takes like 2 minutes.. something in the way they updated it is my guess, but some error in the databases is an issue I had two friends have.
---
In any case it cannot hurt anything and may make his ps4 more stable in general. Just make sure he has a cord he can comment to his ps4 while it's in safe mode. I hope this helps!
---
Beats me. It's like they're not even testing patches, or trying to fix some things that have been issues since release.
---
*Not going to keep arguing with you, If you are so high on your horse in knowing I am wrong then prove it. Make your own guide and your own video detailing the ups and downs of melee vs ranged. But make sure the melee fighter you pick is equal to your build cause I would hate to see you letting a melee beat your ass to prove your point. Although considering I highly doubt you have a decent build, You will probably have to fight some one level 30 or lower* 😂😪
---
So 'the same can be said for objective criticism' means...what? There is no such thing. Objective criticism is called 'facts'.
---
Very good point
---
Yeah but then this would lead to people having essentially unlimited ammo, which is the only reason they haven’t don’t this yet. Too many ammo types, with scrounger you would be able to scrap and craft way too much ammo. The balance feels good now, important to remember it’s a survival game not “here have as much ammo as you want” 
---
I am plentiful on all ammo I use with super duper and ammo Smith / some occasional scrounger in the mix. Also, if you engage with other players you’ll find people are very generous with the ammo they don’t use, everyone has a different build it’s easy to find and trade with someone who has 2500 5.56 that you can use just collecting dust in their inv (but you don’t even have to do that! Lol)
---
It's just to the east of the Senica Rocks visitor center.  The fast travel point is near a rail road bridge.  The power armor is only for fall damage.
---
Ya I am sure a non-shotgun would work better. I just don't get why crippling its ability to fly isn't a valid tactic. 
---
Hello there
---
I have a bloodied explosive .44 on my melee character. I keep it just to kill low level trash with otherwise useless ammo.
---
I'm waiting on Farcry and Metro to drop. Exodus looks sweet.
---
Voice chat mode - none: Area chat seems to be enabled. Is this by design? I’ve got a really bad cold and keep coughing. Feel like the entire game world can hear me. I am not wearing a headset, it’s being picked up through Kinect.
---
I get what you mean. But, why does Ordnance Express make it so you can carry like 100 missiles? Why even carry a missile launcher if I only get about 5 or 10 shots? If you gotta put perks into making it weigh less and making the ammo weigh less, why do they limit your use with crappy durability? I get it though. If there were a deathmatch mode, people would just spam missiles and nukes. But that's a looooot of materials for 100 missiles and nukes. It costs them in the end. 
---
Since the patch to fireproof (explosive res) I got a dense mod on my weightless marine armor (shit still weighs 4!) and I take 0 damage from an exploding car or the dreaded exploding legendary robot. I need to check pvp, specifically an explosive shotgun or your explosive LMG.
---
When you bring it up, make sure you're not just focusing on stealth builds. This is a much larger issue that is affecting everyone. I was under caution or danger for almost my entire play session last night and often couldn't find a single enemy anywhere around me. Pretty much makes Healing Factor useless and why I quit for the night. Thanks for your help sir or ma'am.
---
I heard if you have the perk or had it enabled, it was causing them to drain faster. This was chatter in game and on forums.
---
Just to say it: I think something “worser” is your grammar.
---
If there are no Zetabs now, I feel that they’ll come down the line... VTU journal entries set up for them. One of the language professors talks about studying some petroglyphs that are initially thought to have been left by Pre-Columbus Europeans, but then as time goes on one of the other professors begins to think that they may be extra-terrestrial because they can’t match them to any known people group.
---
I think there’s also allusion to the government being on their backs. A few of the people involved are paranoid and insist all data/research be stored offline.
---
I haven’t seen anything Zetan yet... but feel like the opportunities are definitely there for later content. 
---
Try moving it. Sometimes happens when to close to a wall or other object. Infuriating but.... Bethesda *shrug*
---
More like Not Fix amirite
---
Ain't that the truth.
---
Now I just miss Fallout 3's design for the Nuka-Grenade.
---
Lucky. I played for an hour yesterday and I had an infinite load screen, one straight up crash, which I clipped, and a server disconnect. The day before that I had a scorched with spaghetti-neck and an unkillable SBQ. I put over 1000 rounds into it myself, 8 plasma grenades, and watched a guy next to me throw THREE Oribital Strike Beacons, which did exactly nothing. My guns broke, I gave the thumbs down emote and turned off my xbox. Prior to that, about a month ago, I had 23 crashes in two days - this was cumulative and included about 15 actual crashes, a couple infinite loading screens and about 6 disconnects ( three were in a span of an hour where I had to repeat going through a bunker from the beginning every single time to finish a quest). Scrapped all my junk yesterday to see all 10 Bulk Steel I had just spent 20 plastic on had become un-Bulked. The Watoga Station floors and walls didn't load yesterday, that was cool, took a clip of that. Spawned in to being attacked by two scorchbeasts,ran away into another one, fast traveled away from that one only to get attacked by one while I was talking to the Whitespring Station VendorBot. I lose shotgun shells when I harvest certain plants or loot certain things. I was running along in my power armor and two pieces of it literally just fell off of me onto the ground, broke, and were no longer in my inventory, I clipped that. I've had a TON of fun playing this game, but it's undeniable (for me) that this game has TONS of problems. 
---
Maybe it's Xbox. Who knows. But I've said it before and I'll say it again - in the 25+ years I've been playing video games, I've never had a game crash as much or have as many bugs as this (and it's only been what, two and a half-ish months?). It's an unmitigated disaster, as far as I'm concerned - but that's just my experience. I'm glad you've been luckier. 
---
Yeah, they should add armor penetration onto crack shot or modern renegade. (Or somewhere)  
---
Indeed. I would love to see low level quests or high level quests that everyone can benefit from. The more that participate, the better the impact.  
---
Basic examples.  
---
Low level Event: [Molerat migration] Molerats head down a path from one part of the map to another. The more mole rats stopped, the greater the reward. 1-5 participants results in items and entire server gets 5% experience in Animal kills.  6-10 participants = 10% experience. 11-15 = 15% experience. +16 people, 20% experience bonus when killing animals. 
---
Midlevel Event: [Mole Miner Menace] They swarm a fortified area. Gauntlet users get a bonus to damage. Other weapons are weakened. 1-5 participants results in items and entire server gets coal filters for water.  6-10 participants = additional filters and food. 11-15 = even more filters, food and ammo. +16 people, filters, food, ammo and Random Plan. 
---
A moron circlejerk? Try TD
---
My son is just about there. I haven't been this disappointed since No Man's Sky. And even when I tried playing NMS after the fixes and updates, I just didn't care anymore. It's probably going to be the same here.
---
You free for the calibrated shocks or have a counteroffer you'll accept?
---
My excavator isn't strong enough to grind in the bog, but my X-01 has less carry weight than my regular armour. Please help if you can. Thanks
---
I really hate server hopping. Breaks the immersion. But they need to come up with a way to get the resources you need like junk and ore without server hopping. Loot respawning hourly.

#C.A.M.P. Suggestions
---
I've been spending a lot of time playing around with the CAMP lately /u/BethesdaGameStudios_, so I have a handful of suggestions. First, your request.
---
##C.A.M.P. Décor Ideas
---
* Various "Desk" items, ie: Phones, desk lamps, clipboards + pencils (either as a single placable or as seperate items, but with pencils being so small it might be easier to do them combined), cups, etc.
---
* Desk mounted "Terminal". Have it work just like the "terminal" already in the game, but look like the terminals *litterally everywhere else*.
---
* Tables with cups/plates on them already. That way you can give us a less "barren" looking table without having to deal with rendering a bunch of individual items. Obviously you wouldn't be able to loot any of these combined "cluttered" objects, but you can't for any C.A.M.P. items anyway.
---
* Other "cluttered" surfaces, again to save on rendering a bunch of additional items. Make a single placable item that is a desk with a cup, a clipboard, a couple pencils, and a functional (if powered via broadcast) desk lamp. Then it'd be a single resource but look less plain.
---
* Hanging Curtains. Both for use across windows and "sheer" curtains that you can walk through for use in doorways and across windows. 
---
* Books. Both individually on their backs so you can place them on desks/tables and as a "row of books", as well as shelves with various numbers of pre-placed books.
---
* Fans of various kinds. Desk fans, ceiling fans, pass-through wall fans (so you can put one on a wall and it shows up on both sides of the wall).
---
* Armoires. With and without clothes already hanging in them.
---
* Just, *in general*, more *versions* of the already existing things that include various levels of "clutter". So instead of just a plain, empty desk you could have the empty desk, one with just a clipboard and pencil, one with a clipboard, pencil, and desk lamp, one with a terminal, one with a few books in a row in the back and a desk lamp, etc.
---
* Two-sided "interior" walls. Know that dirty white wall that's on the "back" of the brick wall? Make a wall that has that on both sides. Also, a brick wall that has bricks on both sides.
---
* More Conduit types. Specifically, something like the tall one that goes in and out facing the same direction just switching from floor to ceiling height instead of reversing direction. Also, a few new kinds of pass-through conduit:
---
   * Pass-through conduit that has the connector at floor/ceiling height.
---
   * Pass-through conduit that goes up to the current height, passes through, and *stops* rather than having a pipe that continues up to ceiling height.
---
   * Pass-through conduit where the pass-through connector is at a 90 degree angle to the input pipe, so we can have the conduit running along the wall and then turn 90 degrees to go through the wall it is on rather than having to go through a wall at a corner to not look stupid. 
---
##Other C.A.M.P. Related Ideas
---
* ***Planters*** - These were in Fallout 4 and were awesome. They are just a long, dirt filled object with various plants in them. Don't even have to make it a general "dirt" one, just give us the ones that are already in a couple bunkers *in game* that have the plants pre-planted.
---
* Wall mounted Terminals, also like the ones already in a number of locations. For this one, make it so you can place it on one wall and it has a power connector terminal on the *other side* of the wall, allowing us to connect the terminal outside without having to route wires through the wall for it.
---
* Pass-through three-way switch. This would look like the existing "wall switch", but would have a duplicate of itself on the other side of the wall, perfectly lined up. They would link together. Only one side would have a "power connector" to connect to power and to something the switch needs to control. If you flip the switch on one side, it would flip it on the other side too. That way you can open/close doors both from *inside* and from *outside* without having to try to create some complicated rube-goldberg machine.
---
* Additional versions of the "advanced" doors, for instance ones that have built in doors/switches/keypads that have the keypad on the *outside* of the wall instead of the *inside*. 
---
* "Timed" switches. Works like the pressure plate, looks like a wall switch. You flip it and it sends power for 10 seconds, then stops. 
---
* Placable wall-mounted keypads. You put it on one wall, it has a plug on the *other side* of the wall. When the correct code is put in, sends power for 10 seconds and then stops.
---
* Motion sensors. Acts like an NPC/turret in that it has a "detection radius" and line of sight but instead of attacking things, it powers a connector.
---
* Drop ceilings. So, you would be able to place an "upper floor" layer, put down conduit, and then place a "drop ceiling" on the under side, covering the conduit and support struts of the "upper floor" layer. As a plus, you could have a bunch of styles of drop ceiling to let us customize our C.A.M.P.s more.
---
* More kinds of Fencing. Metal fence, metal railings, non-defense wood railings (preferably ones that don't look like nailed together 2x4s). Basically just a bunch of other options that are at 1/4th wall height. The 1/2 walls are great and all but they don't work as railings.
---
##Additional Terminal Functionality
---
The "Terminal" should also really have additional functionality added to it. Here's a few ideas:
---
* Lock/Unlock a powered door.
---
* Change the "Pin" code for a keypad.
---
* Name specific objects in the network so you can more easily interface with them. Or, if you don't want to deal with keeping track of named objects, at least number them and let us control them individually.
---
* "Guest Notes" - Allow us to type messages into the terminal that can be displayed when anyone uses them. In my dream world we would get a "full" system letting us create sub folders with different levels of access so that there could be a "General" level that anyone who walks up can access that has some notes and some commands, then a folder level with other notes and controls to other objects but I know that's a big ask.
---
Ok...so maybe my handful is a long list. :D Let me know if you want more ideas. I'm full of them.
---
I tried that first, still no dice. I also tried it at work benches at other locations like the train stations. Still nothing 😕
---
You might be disappointed bro. 50% of the time I get 5 endurance from mirelurk queen steak ( sin and class freak perk cards enabled) 50% of the time I get 2 endurance ( sin and class freak cards enabled) so it's a crapshoot. I get super excited when I get the 2x benefits though! My str, end, and agi, will all hit 30 or higher when everything meshes right
---
&gt;Why don't you trade for a better Gatling gun? 
---
Because I don't want duped weapons in my inventory. 
---
Yeah I know. Everyone's two- shot explosive Gatling was acquired legitimately. 
---
They got them legit by paying caps to dupers. 
---
Yeah, game is back to being melee only unless you like shotting something for half hour.
---
My main character uses guns (almost all of which were nerfed into the ground) and these bots are still a massive annoyance. The speed they move at makes it difficult to shoot them, and melee is, well, impossible. They need to nerf the health these guys have to make it some what bareable for melee characters. 
---
Slow down people! Before you hit that down vote for me wanting to make life a little easier for melee builds, I do think melee needs a nerf (or buff other weapon types to match it). Regardless, cargobots are annoying for all weapons, but melee got the, literal, short straw here. 
---
This was sarcasm, btw
---
I got this ps4 not this past Christmas, but the one before that. I don't personally know of more than one person using a pro, and I think it created more issues early on because I don't think they optimized for it.
---
I would guess that PS4 pro is less than 10% of the market share, based on the general population not going for 4k TV's in general.. little reason to get a pro without 4k, and if you're tech savvy I still don't think the pro is worth it for just partially upscaled resolution.
---
Really reaching on this one, Bethesda Austin marketing department.  "Early adopters of Fallout 76"?  No, we bought it as retail customers and have been eating it ever since.  Creation Engine has about as much of a future as the zeppelin.
---
I have the same problem 90% of the time when I play on Xbox
---
Preach
---
I guess only 3k upvote the positive posts too lol. It’s just an inactive group. Maybe it’s half and half. 
---
This is a new feature for you introduced in the newest poo...err I mean patch. 
---
&gt; basically calling them a goddamn liar for talking about bugs that the person in question didn't suffer from
---
To be fair, a fair number of the "issues" apparently were lies. Like trade stealing and such.
---
I have a two shot quad barrel missile launcher that's 3 stars, it's STILL great lol.
---
My biggest pet peeve is that the laser gates to the service and resort entrances to the enclave bunker never let me through, even though I’ve finished the enclave quest lines.
---
I’ve never had that happen before, but yea I’m on Xbox 
---
I don't see the point you are trying to make. But it seems you just have a hard on for hating a game. Which is fine and all. But that's not the purpose of this forum. 
---
If you are on PS4 and need some let me know.  I'll be on later and would be happy to share some from last night's evening of farming.
---
First person into a cell sets the npc and loot level, so if you log out a level 1 and are the first one in after servers are up..
---
Same. I'm on PC and always in PA when traveling.
---
How so? 
---
No it's not. Many studios do this.
---
&gt; And, because human brains are wired this way, people are much more likely to remember and talk about bad stuff than good stuff.
---
Expanding on that: your brain prioritizes information based on how atypical the experience is.  As an example, most people remember or even *notice* the sensation of all the thousands (or millions) of touches we make in any given day, but stepping on a Lego piece or something suddenly going numb are attention-grabbing events.  It’s a survival mechanism to identify and correct the things that go wrong in our lives.
---
Or, to put it another way, it’s common for someone to spend minutes, hours, or even days trying to figure out what went wrong when their aging car has trouble starting, but nobody wonders what went right when the engine turns over on the first try.
---
Only diseased ones. When I was a lower level, I had it chase me around a small building while I took pot shots at it. 
---
1000 each
---
It’s a display issue, it’s not actually removing ammo, just displaying that ammo that you reloaded into a weapon was removed from your inventory.
---
I mean, if you're actually concerned about your time, then it's what you would do. It takes a lot less time than leashing something to kill them
---
Oh man... That Gun was a favourite of mine in New Vegas.  When they added the Honest Hearts DLC, and I got my hands on "A Light Shining in Darkness", I about lost my shit.  I was almost always a pistol build in that game purely because of the .45 pistols.
---
I've seen many of them, including several in Scorched Earth. They're basically big, lumbering, violent teddy bears.
---
I want that time machine monorail to actually work.
---
^ 
---
Was going to say this. 
---
It's very infuriating 
---
Depends on the event, some of them randomly spawn regardless of nearby players (Distant Thunder as I understand it) and the timer counts down from its "spawning"
---
It makes the sound bit you don't actually take damage.
---
Haven’t gotten on an Xbox server in 2 months that had more than 6 people 
---
I was in my house and 4 of those people came by to level while screaming at me for duping.
---
I was by myself and don’t know how to dupe. 
---
I'm not sure if it's been addressed on the past month, but some time ago I sold my **Blade of Bastet**, thinking I could just craft another one. But that isn't the case. Is there any way you could make it so I could return to the Mistress of Mystery fabricator and  craft a new one?
---
I also play on ps4 and after reading this, i fear that i may lose some stuff, what exactly did you lose?
---
On PS4 with same problem. Was walking with hidden by the pumpkin patch. Suddenly I see an albino death claw sprinting to me. Goes straight to danger. Then the local scorchbeast flies straight to me from hundreds of meters away and ignores the death law that he passed to get to me.
---
Full sneak build with all perks, chameleon gear, 24 agi.
---
I haven’t noticed any comment from them either. I wouldn’t think much would go into simply preventing favorited items from being dropped/scrapped as a quick fix.
---
Try looking around for some reason legendaries drop outside the bodies for whatever reason I didn’t even notice until I killed a ghoul and a 3 star minigun spawned from nowhere. Makes me wonder how many legendaries I’ve missed because of this.
---
We were getting them a few days after you guys, but this last update I think we all got it at the same time. Also, I am not sure, but the way PC players talk about servers, it's more dead.. PS4 at the least I've never seen the same player more than once, so griefers are random and seldom, and easy to get away from if needed. I think I've run into 3 groups of griefers in I'm guessing over 400 hours of play?
---
Besides, I think most were just trying to initiate PvP, so hopefully next months survival update will solve that issue altogether.
---
This is unbelievably false, the criticism for this game has extended since launch.
---
This is you creating an argument then attacking it for pathetic reasons. Nothing more.
---
My personal favorite was the one with the firebreather initiates from the farm.
---
I didn’t know there was a wait time. It seems to only reset once I revisit my camp.
---
Nah just a casual. I didn’t really mean to bash serious gamers. Its just odd to me when people take stuff like this so serious. Honestly though I do think it’s sometimes the difference between enjoying the game and not enjoying it.
---
Ah okay. That's good to know.
---
I think you’re the one misunderstanding. Several times I’ve been in the vendor menu for less than a minute and had an impatient player shoot me, yell at me over the mic, or sprint into me repeatedly to try to irritate me into leaving so they can trade. They are the prick and if someone chooses to wait in the menu for a while to make them wait, it’s fair game. 
---
If someone goes AFK in the vendor menu, that’s a different story, but people need to chill and wait 45 seconds for their turn to trade. 
---
&gt;But that's not the purpose of this forum.
---
According to...who?
---
 PvP:
---
* PvP - Griefing - PvP needs a flag. I'm in or I'm out. Or on their own server.... or if they keep attacking you when you do not return attack, give the non PvP a damage shield, that returns FULL damage to the offender.
---
* If you initiate combat via "slap" you should wave your rights to revenge if you lose and must respawn at your camp, and if no camp forced respawn at Vault 76. If you lose, you lose.
---
Make up your mind. You say you are in or you're out. Why do you want to go back to the protection of slap damage virtual invulnerability then when you have willingly engaged in PvP?
---
Queue everyone telling you you're wrong and just crap.... 
---
I noticed the same btw :-)
---
Tagging on to this.  
---
Any way to make a Power Armor Display area that effectually makes the power armor a Display item but can be pulled back into use by the owner if they want.  Behind glass displays or whatnot to keep the game lore friendly as to why anyone can't just come up and take it. 
---
Info: Tweak-Suggestion for the PvE part, PvP doesn't interests me:
---
It would be cool if Demolition Expert multiplies explosive damage by 2/3/4/5/6.
---
I don't see a problem if a rocket gets about 1000dmg and a nuke 2000dmg, or more. High ammo weight, slow reload = They should be hard hitting. One hitting every type of minion in the game? Of course, why not? Ammo is heavy, quite rare and expensive.
---
Legendary explosive effect on the other side should only add simple 5 dmg per shot. Not percentage of the base dmg. Gives a maximum of 30 bonus damage per shot with lv.5 Demo Expert. Should be a nice buff for fast firing and ammo wasting weapons like the MG42 or the Minigun.
---
For balance Two Shot needs a big nerf for high fire rate weapons, rapidly increasing bullet spread over time could be a solution. But it should still be +100% base damage. This legendary effect should fit way better to slow firing, single shot weapons. Don't forget: explosive is weak on them. 
---
This could move TSE to a normal level without making it useless and without nerfing any other explosives in the game. No better, it buffs all explosives to a level where they can wreck something and makes the Demoman build powerful.
---
Do you have any armor that has the -20% weight reduction perk?  Try unequipping those pieces and just in case it gets reequipped automatically, put them into your stash.  I have a feeling the bug involves both the pocketed mods as well as the weight reduction bonus.
---
I found myself chasing one down a hill to loot it the other day.  Afterward I just sat there laughing.  I can't believe it happened, and even worse, I actually chased it.
---
I agree. I have put a fair amount of time into this game (a level 115+ character and a level 90 character...nuke zones used to level me so quickly) and still like it...mostly. I just really can't get over at how I spent $60 on a game that is just FULL of so many issues. This game should NOT have been released. It should have been pushed back another year so it was released properly (mostly) bug free. 
---
I also have been playing video games my whole life and have never played a game (which I paid for) that was this broken. I know they will fix it eventually, but that really shouldn't be the case in the first place. I completely understand why a lot of people are upset with Bethesda right now. With Anthem right around the corner, come the end of this month I will probably stop playing this game entirely...not to mention Division 2 less than a month after. It's too little too late for me at this point. I gave it a shot and had fun while I did, but the crashes and exploits ruined the game for me.
---
Listen, my mother doesn't have anything to do with this... looking at your other comments it doesn't seem we're disagreeing but you misunderstood my comment :p I am saying the wiki states the server has to be "up" for it to be a hot fix but that definition is not from anywhere and there are no citations to make that "official". Most other definitions (like the one you linked) state the same thing that I believe to be the correct and current interpretation, that the service has to be "live" or in production and that the fix needed to be expedited.
---
Killed several of them Mire and Divide. Found one waaay up North  (NW of Berkley cabin) in a “Carhenge” like the Behemoth in FO4. 
---
I've lost valuable items before, and so have many others. There is no way to retrieve them. Sorry.
---
Please don't mention this! My two-shot black power rifle and Two-Shot Dragon are my favorite weapons ... don't want them nerfed any more than they were with the last patch. I actually use these as my mains along with a non-explosive Combat shotty as a back-up for when it gets a little bit "crowded".
---
The sound the BP rifles make is freaking amazing. They are so satisfying to use that I'm willing to put up with the riduculously (yet quite understandably) high reload times.
---
Have you made sure all your materials are stored either in your inventory or in your stash?  Not split between the two?
---
I have lost 1 pair of bottle cap sunglasses, 1 clean ski hat, 1 clean space suit helmet a clean steel mining helmet 
---
Or just charge every time, and put the timer on the map.
---
Because all the people complaining about the state of the game all seem to be PC players, and they act like I'm crazy for having a good experience. From the comments in the post it seems like the majority of console players (at least that responded) are also having little/no issues.
---
Are you on PC? Has your experience been good or as bad as the people complaining daily?
---
Feel free to pull data from the (2) threads I've got linked in this post, a number of other issues covered there as well.  
---
[Bethesda the Mod Author community has been try to provide fixes to you since the BETA. You are still ignoring us and not using them../](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aljowa/bethesda_the_mod_author_community_has_been_try_to)
---
You’re surprised ? 
---
I'm a casual player, as well. I'm a middle aged lady with a more than full time job, family, etc. so my play time is limited to roughly 90 minutes in the evening after everyone else has gone to bed and maybe two hours on a Saturday and maybe two hours on a Sunday.
---
On XB.
---
After December's patch my game was literally unplayable. Most of the time I couldn't even load into a game and when I did, I got DC every five to six minutes on average. None of the mics we had in the house would work with the game anymore. I eventually bought a pricier router, one marketed for gaming, and I was able to play again. (The router was around $250, just to keep playing 76.)
---
I've learned not to try to open my pipboy until after my toon has fully loaded into the world or I'll get a DC.
---
My IRL friend and I never fast travel at the same time or one of us turns invisible to the other. 
---
I find it pretty common for me to get DC trying to enter the WS resort if there are a few other players nearby.
---
So I think one's mileage will vary. 
---
I have to leave for work in 20 minutes. Are you free now? Or otherwise in 12 hours?
---
Yes of course I sell it. I bulk on the fly when I can and keep looting and auto scrapping as probably many of us do as we venture about. After all, can’t always be next to a stash before we get over -encumbered. Figured they wouldn’t have screwed that up...  
---
What hype? There was next to no hype for this game. Anyone with a brain who watched the release news would have known what this was-- it's Fallout 4 in a bigger world without the story.
---
You SHOULD feel bad, because it sounds like you hyped it for them and either didn't do your research on the game, or completely misread the stuff out there that described it. And yes, it was always clear that the game was gonna be buggy as a Bethesda game, especially as a first shot at online. Hell, they released a statement specifically telling people the game would be messy on release before it came out... why didn't you just refund then?
---
I really don't understand these posts. There's no attempt to improve anything, it's just a big fat whine job and I'm amazed you're posting it this late after launch because all of your problems are so baseline, you would have known about them months ago. Did you just wait for the rage on this forum to bubble up so you could get some buoyancy for your whining? xD
---
You know I'm sitting on over 600 Glass scrap, with NOTHING to use it for.
---
Oh, Melee still works great! I've got All Rise and Optimized Bracers on my PA Arms and I have a blast Heavy Attacking things.
---
You really only lose out on Unarmed stuff.
---
Well no because you craft them into molotov as soon as you can, and use Heavy Ordnance. 
---
&gt; Just googled this, Fallout 4 came out Nov 10th, 2015. First DLC was March 2016 (Automatron) the first REAL game expansion, Far Harbor, was in May. FO76 is in no way behind schedule for content update compared to the previous game. 
---
Comparing single-player games with multiple play through paths and with mod support from day one with an online multi-player game isn't exactly apples to apples there.  Comparing it to other online multiplayer games would be much more apt.
---
Mr. President get down!
---
Not the thread this sub deserves, but the one it needs. 
---
Yep, this is a PS4 classic.  Has happened to me a number of times while fast traveling, game just fails to load part of your equipped items when you arrive.  If it happened to you in a different context, then it's probably some other bug.  Not aware of a fix or even a "workaround" as they call them these days.
---
“Is it just me or do I never get any bugs?!?!?”
---
Meanwhile skipping over the lack of end game, that the only end game content will fly away r disappear before you can loot it, etc. 
---
I’m not convinced they’re actual commenters now. It’s been unwavering support from the same people - paid shills. 
---
Most of my skills come from learning wood and metal shop in junior high and high school. I also did construction for a few years, and I have almost always had access to a decent workshop from my grandfather's as a kid and young adult to building my own as I could. Now I am just trying to motivate myself to get out in the cold to clean up and start working again. 
---
One of my first good Plans I found on my current Rifleman character. Bit of a disappointment. Also annoying to get mods for. Needs 6 nuclear material to create. Fucking _why_
---
I gave up on it when I got a lever action rifle that came with a medium scope and did better damage, and dumped all my ammo that must've been made from 1500 steel. Weighed a ton too
---
Because there isn’t any viable build anymore except for melee. I do 1000 damage with my +40% and martial artist gauntlet when below half health. 
---
Melee is literally all I use now. If they nerf that as well, I’m gone. All of my friends no longer play 76 and moved on to that Destiny crap. I’m gonna need to find a new game to sink my time into. Maybe ESO or Ark? Idk
---
I'd like to add that there is now an issue with being under "caution" or "danger" an excessive amount since the last patch. This is the case even when there are no enemies anywhere remotely nearby. Also, can someone please take five minutes to fix the slide selector when pricing items from your inventory? It can't be a difficult fix and it would make a surprising impact on quality of life, in my opinion. Thanks!
---
Its a list of viable options / solutions to PvP.
---
I would personnaly prefer a flag... all in or all out.  But that may not be an option to the Developers, so I gave another pathway.
---
My mind is made up... but I am flexible.
---
Also I've noticed it glitches out far less then the normal animation.
---
Thanks! I'm trying to think of another character to role play as. Maybe a hero?
---
It's ok I don't care much for PvP either other than to defend myself if some douche attacks me first
---
Ok, ill see if i have the same problem and ill let you know if i find a solution.
---
I finally found it at the ski resort
---
I've had the search problem also.  If the stashes are going to be searchable then they need to always be searchable.
---
you're making quite the request considering I don't even have an youtube channel just to win an internet argument. so I'll just say this: stealth boy.
---
ah, what the hell. I'll say a few more things. what sort of... "genius" thinks it's a good idea to charge at someone wielding a Fatman from a mile away? if distance is something you, as a melee player, have to worry about, then I'm sorry but you're doing it wrong. distance means squat.
---
but that's not even the point. the point is that melee is op. no matter what you say you're not gonna justify a weapon dishing out 15k+ per swing with a poorly optimized build. str scaling, power attacks, ninja, radicool, booze. melee has way too many things going on for it and can break 30k with a good build, 50k on a party.
---
*it needs to be nerfed*. bloodied too. now squirm like tse users did.
---
How'd they break their leg, then?
---
That would be a cool little bonus, but only if something in the camp relied solely on that power, like an electric chair that grants temporary energy resistance or something. Just spitballing here.
---
The only red scare in WV is from the hats. There are 2 types of businesses in WV, 1st deals in heart disease and heart disease accessories. 2nd is coal. But I'm sure all of them are stockpiling coal for ~~russia~~ trump.
---
Well I refrain from complaining, this is sorta my first. But 70 percent of the  time I fast travel to my camp, I spawn underneath a staircase and can’t move, and have to fast travel in again and hope it turns out better.
---
Also several of the missions are broken , because I did them co op with someone further along with me, and every time I fast travel , the number of frag mines in my inventory doubles for some reason (they are a quest item for rose) unfortunately I cannot use, store or craft with them in anyway , they just double and take up more space, I finally became overencumbered and diddnt turn on the game after that. 
---
Might give it a try again soon . Maybe some bugs have been fixed . 
---
I've heard of others having non-equipped perks trigger too though I haven't noticed it myself.
---
As for Luck of the Draw I think I had it (rank 3) proc 4 or 5 times last night. I'm almost at a break-even point. I have a one-handed melee and pistol build.
---
Lucky Break's not working as well as I hoped, or I've had bad luck the last couple days. I have both it and White Knight at rank 3 and my armor's still breaking. I wanted to nullify the repair aspect of the game but they're not making it easy.
---
I like the Skyrim model for this...  decorative weapons racks, armor mannequin etc. the Pegboard could be used as a weapons rack or even the store shelves  (like the ones in the watuga brotherhood merchant). For armor, the store mannequins for body armor, and the power armor displays from FO4. 
---
For the storage issue. Current stash boxes work great for accessing items globally but why can’t we create individual storage boxes at our camp that are independent of the global stash box? I go back to the Skyrim model. If you had a potion table you had storage boxes close to it for the potion component materials. I wouldn’t need those items globally, only at my camp to make the potions. Same thing for FO76 for some items a storage box next to my tinker bench to store lead for making ammo for example, I really don’t need access lead unless I’m building ammo which is typically not while I’m out exploring. 
---
Now if we could just figure out how to get Dogmeat in fo76 :)
---
But other than that, that's a good list of suggestions. 
---
Considering you're not even supposed to get this, obviously it is a glitch
---
Oh yeah and btw *The IRS wants to know your location*
---
Holy shit, great idea.  I would 100% participate more in events, (low to high level) if travel to them was free. There is already a risk of going into a nearly finished event and the rewards are good.  Plus if it fails, you still have to travel back to your spot so the expense is still there.
---
Love this idea.

Three for me in the hour I played yesterday. I posted about it if you care to look it up. 
---
*Add .45 Pipe Revolver to Legendary Loot Table|s*
---
You could check that ESM site to see if they were changed to auto scrap
---
I had a bug where my own turret in my camp became hostile to me turned red and everything, it wouldn't let me fast travel due to "enemies nearby" and it would attack me. It didn't do any damage and I couldn't damage it, so I ended up having to scrap it and build a new one. Some weird bugs going on...
---
Level does allow you to build more there could be someone who has the math on this.  But i noticed the increase was very slight maybe 1 more floor piece per level.  Though I'm not actually sure if its the budget moving up causing items to look like they cost less or if its just a flat increase in budget, either way i don't think it matters the outcome is the same.
---
Is this a plot spoiler?
---
I use nuka grenades and forget sometimes when throwing being too close. I tend to take myself sometimes :) In regards to ammo maybe not all ammo is scrap able but maybe just the heavy - missiles, mini nukes, plasma cores? I see your point though.
---
Posting those here, since you asked for feedback.

/u/BethesdaGameStudios_ I am sure that you aware of https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj11j2/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_jan_2019/ by /u/Aten_Ra.

Inspired by that list, I decided yesterday to start a github repo for the community to be able to report, track, and comment on known bugs and feature requests. Here is the spill, and we would really love if you join us in this effort.
---
## Introducing [Bugthesda - Community Issue Tracker for Bethesda games](https://github.com/bugthesda)
---
Bugthesda is a github "organization" were community members can open Issues (bug reports, feature requests, etc.) for games developed by Bethesda Game Studios. Right now there is only a repository for Fallout 76, since I do not want to interfere with the bug tracker the guys over [AFK Mods](https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/) (they guys that bring us the Unofficial Patches), and cause double duty.
---
This endeavor requires the participation of the community and it will need some people to take moderation roles to keep it in check. So, is you are interested, send me a message.
---
### Visit Bugthesda at https://github.com/bugthesda

Missing a critical Crash to Desktop error effecting players on all platforms.    
---
in the post I have the proof of concept, repeatable error and the fix for it.
---
[[Bug Fix] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/)
---
If they changed outfits to auto scrap then i quit this game
---
Yeah, but you also sound like you probably know more than your average PC player- as time goes on there seems to be far more people that are pretty clueless.
---
Like last night a made a short list of suggestions to someone who said they know PC based on their issues.. they never responded, but someone else did with "so it's a requirement to do all these things just to play a game!?" No dude, that's required to qualify yourself as a PC person so you don't have a shit machine.
---
I'm glad you have a good experience, maybe you should make a post with what your hardware is and what applications and processes you leave running in the background. My PC died, but I obsessed about killing any process that wasn't critical to my needs, because that caused the least issues in general.
---
This thread makes a good point. I guess that because pistols have been pure shit in this game, going back at least as far as Fallout 3, people just don't think about them anymore and have basically written them off. 
---
Because rifles and heavy weapons were great in Fallout 3 and 4, people expect them to be in Fallout 76.
---
But since they have been terrible in every Fallout game in the past decade, at least compared to rifles and heavy guns, people basically just don't think about them anymore. 
---
Sad but true. 
---
I have marsupial and speed demon recipies, 2000 a piece or 3000 for both, also willing to trade serums 
---
The Queen should be available to more than just the 4 people on a team, it's a server event, period. I do agree however that there should be some sort of prerequisite to going into battle against her, and some rebalancing   needs to be done with her HP scaling.
---
Whitesprings level cap is no bueno either..imo
---
Just throwing my hat into this ring.  I am by no means a stealth master, and don't have special equipment on my little level 26 sniper-in-training.  
---
Prior to the patch - I could sneak within range and take down a few mobs without even a "caution".  You know, pick out the outliers, set a mine or two...  
---
Now - Apparently they put twigs everywhere because I sneak onto a ridge to look down.  No caution, still hidden... perfect...  
---
Fire one shot with my supressed rifle on an outlier enemy, jumps straight to danger and everyone and their mother knows exactly where I am. Random people walk by, Scorchbeasts hone in on the location, Swarms of Feral Ghouls come from the Sons of Dane compound rush me because ll the rackit I'm making... Okay, so overdramatic, but the point remains.
---
Possibly unrelated, but the day the patch came out, I was over my weight limit without experiencing any over encumbrance penalties.
---
I took wood shop in high school, now I just tinker with projects if I have time. YouTube videos are helpful, but what I really need is space and extra time. 
---
as i keep telling my game buddie as he almost rages in questions of how and why. its 76 its broke.accept it and move on before you hurt yourself lol
---
I don't want BP nerfed either, all I want is a dmg increase to ballistic weaponry they should rightfully deserve, they fire things that explode  
---
Rad Worms is causing the Lockpicking 4 thing. Check out one of the topics about it on this Reddit when you get the chance.
---
Thanks for the down votes on a joke :)
---
just read back? we're going in circles at this point. the crashing, the PR.
---
Rent Free!
---
Nice one, but more like fighting a temporal fugue master to my mind.
---
I've killed the SBQ often enough to know when we're ahead of the clock.
---
Yep. It's not due to the patch by the way, I had that a few times when fiddling with PA too. It usually goes away after a relog. 
---
Maybe had a tiiiiiny bit of health left on the leg and a firecracker berry finished it off? Or an enemy under the map. That bug could be back.
---
But what if this fixes the things you didn't want fixed. I feel like there's no winning on this one.
---
This has happened to me today. I'm very frustrated with this. 
---
Just a lot more uniqueness, lore and depth. Ubi games tend to be quite shallow. Don't get me wrong some are good and ive played a bunch. Ubi is more content than quality which can be fun but its always over quick. I tend to never even finish them.
---
Based on what I've read, it seems like this happens whenever the person she's currently aggroed on disconnects.
---
Good luck finding a vendor with an amount a caps even near that
---
And I've given my take on it. It's not as bad a game as everyone is saying it is. It has it's flaws and problems but that is the norm.
---
ok..thnx
---
Heck yeah. Heading over the savage divide; beautiful
---
I play on consoles, have up on PC gaming while in the army back in the 90s.  Long story, but I'm happier this way.
---
I dunno i play with you 90% of the time you tell me. 
---
I play with your mom the other 10% of the time so maybe you should ask her?
---
Tagging on to this,  How about making a bounty for damaging a camp but then if the player REPAIRS said camp, the bounty is reduced until the damage dealt equals the damage made. BUT ONLY to that camp.  
---
AKA, can't damage player A's house and receive a bounty but go to player B's house and reduce/remove the bounty. 
---
You should change the Two Shot back to +100% and I'm fine with the NERF to the EXPLOSIVE part. Otherwise rename the guns to be One &amp; Quarter Shots then.
---
I've had that happen once. Then I got killed. Off popped the armor. Weird glitch.
---
A timer showing how long the event has so you don't waste your time going there when it has a minute left?? That's crazy talk! 
---

---
Let's just say PETA would firebomb my house.
---
Steam doesnt.
---
It’s not even letting get that far. 
---
I can’t access terminals or anything like that now.
---
u/BethesdaGamesStudios_
---
\*sigh\* Yep it's frustrating. But server stability has been better for me at least. Hopefully BGS will do all they can with factors they control to prevent disconnects, as its frustrating whether you're in the middle of a target-rich nuke zone, fighting the queen, or just have a bunch of workshops claimed and built up.
---
I don't understand the purpose of this thread. You basically just called someone's camp a 'poorly designed shitbox' and then proceeded to talk about how much fun you had getting inside and doing not much of anything at all. Was leaving spoiled meat and fertilizer supposed to be a funny insult to them?
---
What am I missing here? I don't get the humour part, but it does seem like you're being a snooty dick for no reason whatsoever. o\_O
---
Could someone else check this out for me, since patch 5, when I use a recon scope the "PIP" no longer shows up when zoomed in on an enemy, you have to zoom in, find the enemy and then go back out of scope mode before the pip shows up.
---
I thought before the patch you could see the PIP show up in the scope, and you could then move around a group of enemies and mark them all.
---
I noticed this doing the "Distant thunder" mission.
---
I’d appreciate some process to turn them into static objects to place. There was a FO4 mod that did it well
---
I think that is a good idea
---
Are you Jill the master of unlocking?
---
Im on level 150 and love it, have not had much to complain about, most irritating for me now is weapons break way to fast and queen is too hard now, we were about 10 guys yesterday i was 2nd lowest and we could not kill her in time, way i see it it is a survival game, it should be hard, you should struggle to find stuff, must be on the edge of depression..... some guys want to be gods with one shot weapons and being fed grapes while they sit is a bath... i think there is some barbie games out there for them to play. Just being naughty.... 
---
She cheats, the cheater.
---
Hold it. Some collectors pay crazy caps for that.

---
Dude that's some elitist shit. I'm baffled that anyone would thumbs up such a comment... this is a casual Fallout game not an artistic competition. What's wrong with you?
---
Then they need to put more locations to get ballistic fiber in the game.
---
You need to document these with videos like I did or your word means little
---
Lol, the /s wasn't needed. You drizzled the sarcasm on thick enough for pancakes.
---
&gt; Because there isn’t any viable build anymore except for melee.
---
This is... so fucking stupid. Oh QQ TSE guns aren't the best by a factor of 4 anymore, guns are no longer viable. I'm going to wallow in my own puddle of tears and waste others' time in the SBQ fight by standing around rather than maybe throw a few perks into a gun spec and help out.
---
 For the search problem of cap stash, there is a temporary solution : run for a few steps, come back and the search tab will return. It just works as the other crook guy says
---
Latex allergy, all leather and oil for this guy
---
Probably just accidentally scrapped it while scrapping junk armor pieces, or sold it while selling junk armor - almost certainly didn't just disappear on its own.
---
I've had it happen where I went to scrap something, hit confirm, game hangs.... hit confirm again just in case, try to back out, game catches up and scraps the item as well as the item that was right below it in my list.  Saw it happen, know that's what happened in my case, can't say for sure with you but it seems more likely than random disappearance that's so far unreported anywhere else.
---
Or modify a fatman.
---
Another great raft of suggestions, I'm really grateful to all these replies, I'll keep your post saved for future reference.
---
I only use a basic Logitech 2 button with wheel, I may have to invest in something with more switches. 
---
Going to look into Unyielding and Dense for the Torso piece thanks for that. Maybe running minimum may be easier to manage for basic farming wherever I happen to be. I've never got into VATS so I'm not worried about Scaly Skin, apart from the icky name :) Keep wanting to apply healing salve to stop the itching.
---
Grounded and speed demon... I've got a visit to Grafton rad pond coming up by the looks of things, I've stuck with Scaly Skin and Twisted Muscles, they are the first and only mutations I've received, was too worried about getting others that may have sucked. I'm going to need to spend time mutating and healing and see if I can get a better selection.
---
I had carnivore actually but lost it by sucking down RadX without Starched Jeans, remember it was pretty useful, maybe I'll be lucky and get that again.
---
I've got Barbarian 3\* and Ironclad 5\* now, never tried this Junk Shield will look at it, I like to travel light usually with zero junk so might not be worth it for me.
---
I'm going to have to sort out what the hell is happening with my BOS Auto Stim Right Arm, it doesn't proc below 25% health, will have to find some other pieces to ee if they work.
---
Thanks for your detailed reply, very helpful.
---
I play on xbox one x and still deal with issues on the daily. Ironically during the closed beta I never had any issues besides lag. Up till the current patch I still get constant disconnects, bringing up the map too quick sometimes causes my game to crash, fast traveling can cause textures to load incorrectly, unlootable bodies, glitched quest items, social bar not showing people online or not able to join/fast travel, invisible team mates, and finally when looking at light textures sometimes the rays will cause my textures to invert colors. I play with my Fiance who has an xbox one x as well in her office, but she plays with a 1080p freesync monitor and doesn't get the same texture issues I get. Overall I still like the game, but its definitely the worst performing Xbox game I have ever played. 
---
yes, but i think the tradeoff is worth it.
---
Well if we're to go off of black powder weaponry, im going to judge that the ammo we use would be akin to .50 cal miniballs.
---
Older guns, namely the M1795 could fire .69 cal balls, and the british brown bess could fire .75 cal balls. Which are 17.5mm and 19mm wide respectively.
---
Try going into safe mode and rebuild your database- you need a cord to plug the controller in while in safe mode. You're issues sound like my buddies issues and that resolved a majority of them.. this last update should have solved the mods getting eaten issue, and almost every other issue you mentioned should have been solved by the one before that or even earlier.
---
Stability wise early on I would have rated it the same.. by last month I would raise it to a 7.5, and with the last 2 updates I would put it at around 8.5- it's been rock solid for me.
---
Or how about the horde events? You fast travel tui the event only to have it completed because the legendary enemy was killed by another enemy.....
---
Can the event only proc the legendary enemy if a player actually joins the event? 
---
This is happening to me as well. I’m finding I need to be about 100lbs under weight to not get the over-encumbered warning. Are you using the Excavator power armor by chance? I wasn’t having any issues until I started wearing the excavator suite. Now when I step out the weights are all kinds of screwy. Super annoying as I’m in the middle of trying to collect a ton of steel and lead. 
---
Did anyone ever say and prove it did?
---
Minus value hmm sell it to a vendor and let us know what happens...
---
For science!.
---
On another thread about 10 confirms saying its not on xbox or ps4. Why i assumed this. Mine is also working (ps4)
---
Yeah now post patch I bet it deals 550 lol
---
Like them ideas!!!
---
Someone lower level was in zone or spawned them before you arrived, I've tested this (I reported it in the BETA) after every patch.
---
Actually not new, been playing since the beta opened and I’ve played all the fallout games. I’m tired of everyone having such a huge boner in the community for shitting on Bethesda. I craft things all the time, still not banned. I don’t have cheaters on my friends list though so I don’t imagine I’ll have any problems ;)
---
This I can agree with. I have no doubts at all. 
---
Haha I am going to try and get another one. I don’t want my only one to go away! 
---
I miss the issue where part of the shot off healthbar returns on enemies.
---
Was fixed before but came back with last patch. hotfix didnt fix it.
---
I have it only with ranged weapons. 
---
thanks.
---
At this point I take the "caution" and "danger" alerts as a general comment on the state of the game.
---
Very creative! 
---
and I've already replied to your take, explaining why you're wrong. I can even pinpoint when you stopped replying with arguments, here: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am041u/something_our_parents_used_to_tell_us_when_we/efj9mmq/
---
&gt;It has it's flaws and problems but that is the norm.
---
there you go downplaying the situation again. what Bethesda is doing isn't the norm. the worst example that comes to mind is NMS and Fo76 is infinitely worse.
---
Letting bethesda make their own decisions is part of the reason we are in this mess of a game to begin with. They nerf and change shit for no reason, half the time they dont even tell us. They DO NOT need to be in charge of decision making and that is painfully obvious
---
A predisposition to be an ass at times.
---
i dont use power armor, except for nuke events, so that's not it.
---
good to know tho.
---
Progression and stability. The full patch notes are floating around here. It's disgusting.
---
It really is super addicting, l kinda hate myself because ill be super mad at Bethesda but ill still play lol. 
---
Two typos in the first paragraph of your post.
---
 "does not cover **off** every single"  - Extra word
---
 "and where **are** team is at" - I think you meant "our" 
---
This does not look good for your quality assurance, and it perfectly sums up the problems with this game - you need better attention to detail.
---
Ah np.. Glad you got something out of it.
---
An added effect for this particular bug; if you’ve constantly in Cation, then Healing Factor and Regeneration armor won’t activate.  This is one I’ve experienced myself and can obviously replicate since (Hidden) is our prerequisite for these to work.
---
I agree that the engagement system is dumb as hell. But I'm also not much of a PvPer. So I'm really hoping 95% of it moves to the Survival servers when they open. Because ya, the slap system is a terrible mechanic, and I think people will be a lot happier with unrestricted PvP in Survival. Because as it is, the system in Adventure sucks. Tbh I hope after Survival they come out with something totally non-PvP for the people looking for that too. The half-assed middle ground they have now is nobody's friend.
---
Oh right, 1000 as the ultimate maximum with all things considered, that makes sense. Still seems a bit silly for a melee weapon to do more than a mini nuke tho
---
Non stealth pistol build here.
---
Pistols completely suck until you get GRS, better crits and crit savvy. The latter two don't unlock until LEVEL 45! And these perks can be used on any weapon, I'm just gimping myself using them with pistols.
---
Modern renegade is completely useless (4% cripple chance? I'm user a revolver, it literally never procs)
---
Packing light should be moved to strength
---
The single action revolver is a completely useless weapon unless you are trying to cosplay Revolver Ocelot. You can try to fix it by taking quick hands and hoping it procs on that last shot.
---
That's a good point, I'd buy junk if there was a weapon/armour I was working towards :) 
---
True but I feel like a heavy build really cuts down on your flexibility for QoL perks.
---
There’s times I feel 15 strength isn’t even enough since a huge chunk of it is weight mitigation perks. I wish I could run traveling pharmacy, lock and load, bullet shield, and others but I can’t justify taking off stuff like bear arms, ordnance express, bandolier, etc. add in 3 rank 1 heavy gunners and I only have 4 slots left. 
---
Until I clean out my stash again, I can’t even put some guns back in the box since they go back to normal weight. 
---
In general there’s a lot of perks that feel almost mandatory for any build. I just feel heavy weapons builds have more of these than some others. Just my opinion though
---
Or a super sledge costs a lot less to maintain and deals a ton of damage while everything else costs a bit for use.
---
This is probably the worst suggestion I've ever come across here. I have a hatred against explosives because they are so silly, annoying, and just plain dumb. Regular weapons are fine. Automatic assault rifle, handgun. You never got all these crazy explosive weapons in previous Fallout games so why the hell should you have them now? You think the real world is just littered with explosive weapons and missile launchers? They made it more realistic. 
---
Another thing I will say is this. they were very overpowered and extremely silly. Running around with a fat man, you can just destroy large swaths of enemies with no effort. Also workshops too. Such a dumb weapon. will never forget the time someone came into my camp and just started shooting explosives off to ruin my play experience
---
Ultracite ammo. I have not really tried to get much flux, so I only have 60 rounds. 
---
I have that as well but I generally don't direct it at people over aesthetics lol.
---
I’ve been having issues with what seems to be an abundance of Scorchbeasts chasing me for crazy long distances in the last few days. It’s frigging annoying. Im only level 45 so they are still significantly hard to take down. Had to server hop several times now due to them absolutely decimating my camp. 
---
Haven't found another one, btw. he is tiny: [https://i.imgur.com/H9Qy0bT.png](https://i.imgur.com/H9Qy0bT.png)
---
It holds the crate underneath and has thrusters or rotors like a quad copter at each corner. 
---
PS4!
---
&gt;Yes, and that's how the MAJORITY of people felt! The minority stuck in denial don't think like the rest of you.
---
Oh man do I love you. You are a really great guy. Super smart, put me right in a hole. I admit on that one.
---
Beyond that this is a forum for discussion and not just subjective criticism. My original comment was an objective statement. No bias, just the facts. 
---
No clue then
---
Sorry, I was being a dick, I shan't remove the evidence, I'll go stand in the corner :(
---
Garahhan (sp?) We were just in his tower last night and found the holotape along with the animal cages.
---
Not the max, people get way over that stacking loads of bobbleheads.....
---
there are legitimate reasons they have not done this, it's in the "known issues" thread.
---
There is a time limit to complete challenges, but they can be completed *before* the timer expires.
---
Example Challenge:  kill 5 things in 5 mins.  kill all in 1 min, challenge ends.
---
I was so excited when I found that area. Only to be obliterated by rads afterwards.
---
I’d take a perk or a drug for highlighting corpses or flowers ready to pick.  It would make my time in the Cranberry Bog much easier.
---
We could call the self-hug jackets....
---
Nice list of ideas!!
---
My uncle works at Bethesda and he told me to tell you to git gud.
---
Something that should be considered. Maybe add the letters G, Y, R to the markers to match the corresponding color? 
---
Wish I could say you might be right but I was legendary farming at whitesprings. I had just loaded up the at my base ( in 3rd person to show off the outfit ) so i could see i was wearing the item, went and did my run ( in power armour ) and when I returned to my base to put the items away i got out of my power armour to find my outfit wasnt on anymore, nor in my inventory or my stash, i had not dropped anything or scrapped or stored anything before that moment :/
---
I've wanted this change. There's not a lot of event participation unless it's uranium fever, and charging people doesn't add to the incentive.
---
So people don't abuse it, maybe the cost could be deferred so you're still charged if you abandon or fail the event. It's free travel but only if you finish. And I might exclude workshop defense events unless you're the owner or in a team with them, otherwise it becomes a free ambush teleport.
---
On a related note, events should disappear from the map when their countdowns reach a likely point of no return. I've joined events only to see them fail the moment I arrived.
---
My asshole has a mind of it's own and sometimes it says things without thinking it through.
---
The unruly golfers one is particularly annoying since there's almost always high level people at Whitesprings, so everything there spawns as level 50+ anyway. Can't do it at low level cause you die, can't do it at high level cause they don't spawn.
---
Ahhh that's no good. If on console I would recommend maybe deleting saved data from the console and try restarting. Might be enough to get it going. 
---
Nice. I've been looking for upgrades to my GG and .50 cal. The only explosive weapon I have is a harpoon gun which I modified for flechettes and use to take out trash mobs. The GG is just a furious, so I use that whenever she's landed, along with orbital strikes, and once she's under 50%, switch over to the executioner's .50 cal. And all 3 heavy weapons perks + maxed out bloody mess.
---
Ive gotten full loot before the event completed, and Ive also had to wait for the event to get any loot whatsoever (which can take upwards of 5 minutes spinning circle when its really bad). What Ive never had happen was partial loot first and then the legendary later.
---
I may stick around adventure to grief people tbh. Pvp is like sex. Its better when its unwanted. 
---
I dont feel like rerolling. 
---
Where did you find it?
---
I only found the corpse of a dog next to its owner who went to rescue it from the raiders 
---
I actually enjoy both of your arguments and I feel like to an extend you are right. Going back to the Comment that started this the point is how extreme people have been reacting to a video game. Fallout76 will not be a topic that will be talking about 100 years from now like Shakespeare because we don’t compare classic literature to comic books. 
---
Yes video games will be a topic in the future that will be talk about the same way we talk about classic literature, but this game is not it. Mario,pong,Galaga,street fighter, mortal Kombat, etc. This are games that had an impact in society and are worth discussing and talking about how the change culture, how they reshape an entire generation. 
---
But the amount of hate and drama behind a game that is obvious now it lunch in a incomplete state is being overblown when all you have to do is take the disc out and move on to the next game(the better game one might argue. Cough cough...cyberpunk lol)
---
Facts that do not change the discussion, so if you are trying to discuss you aren't going about it in a very good way.
---
yeah, some would do that, but it doesn't hurt anything and for those wanting to do events, it increases participation.

See, that's the kind of thinking a real PC gamer should have. Like one dude was saying he had to lower his resolution to 720 after an update, and I kinda figured he was probably pushing the limits of his setup. But that's what happens when you have gamers that shouldn't be on PC, they have no idea how to maintain it much less troubleshoot.
---
So if I log in and fast travel to a friend, and we hadn't invited each other to team yet, and a scorched is beating his mutfruit with a pipe, and I blow him apart and damage his mutfruit, I deserve a wanted?
---
Believe this is a result of the rad worms bug interacting with speed demon mutation, causing the positive and negative effects to increase. 
---
Well I think it’s doable depending on the combo of perks you use. I also have max weapon artisan so realistically with 200% cond. I was getting upwards of 6-12 shots with the MIRV and around 15-25 with the launcher, haven’t tested the exact number (and this was well before any recent patches / nerfing so I’m afraid to log in and see) but that alone was working really well for me. 
---
I have single handedly wiped out higher level squads in white springs zones, ran groups of 2-4 out of workshops, and defended myself from random griefers pretty successfully as a result of my build. I shouldn’t have been able to kill people 1v4. Honestly if I have the ammo, I can prob PVP about 20-30 times with my explosives alone, before I have to throw in the towel and pull out my explosive two shot LMG, which I literally NEVER to pull out because I usually nuke someone about 3-5 times and then they run away or send a hateful message lol. I think if perks allowed me to make my setup any better it would be unfair, I can shoot 6 missiles with double explosive radius in about 1.5 seconds and that’s usually enough to scare ppl away on its own, not to mention between mole miners and Super Duper / Ammosmith I essentially have unlimited missiles.
---
And somehow you've provided arguments? At the same time you stopped providing anything useful and just kept saying the same thing. 
---
No response from Bethesda? Not a big enough outcry to valid a response or fix i guess
---
They've got community managers all up in this subreddit who are doing exactly that, mind. They even frequently mention their reports which are exactly that, they summarize sentiments and feedback then hand that to devs.
---
While I am saying us posters are an extreme minority, we do tend to act like canaries in the coal mine, especially for certain issues. My point is, even when we're right about something it still might not matter, that's just the truth of finite time and resources.
---
thats cool
---
This is something I've been wanting for a while too. Favorites should automatically be locked against auto-scrapping, and we should be able to lock other things in the Pip-Boy with a button press. It's better when you have enough hours in the game that most of your stuff is legendary, but even then you've got power armor and underarmor to consider. I've lost one piece of Shielded Forest Operative Underarmor due to this so far, and as I'm an idiot, it'll happen again. :P
---
1) we are ignored normally, so any attention is good
---
2) we understand the man vs machine issue better than many so it is good for others to see how it affects people.
---
3) we get to play in our home state and show it off some to people who otherwise would never see it.
---
&gt; And I might exclude workshop defense events 
---
Agreed.  
---
Although I think it's weird that those are community-wide events to begin with.  They should only pop for those who own the workshop since it's a pvp zone.
---
I've got thru hiker coz I'm a Nuka/dog food guy and carry 15 cans with me at all times, so only need maybe ten stims for emergencies. 
---
It's strange how accommodating I've become of Inventory Management Simulator 2018 masquerading as a Fallout game
---
Were you able to interact with him?
---
I remember when I built my 50 cal , that I was disappointed when I found out that my wooden stick was causing more damage
---
I noticed with the disappearing corpses, what's happening is when they die they teleport to the location they spawned in their original state but unlootable and uninteractable. It happened today with ghouls for me in fort defiance, they would teleport back to the "sleeping" position and take their inventory with them but you'd just walk right through them.
---
Agree. Got similiar issues on my stealth build. Perk Escape artist is cousing some problems as well.
---
Yeah, that’s why I don’t use any melee chems, magazines, or bobble heads at Whitesprings.   It may take me a couple of extra swings to take out a glowing one, but it leaves them open for tagging by others or another melee to jump in.  I also hit one, then switch to another.  No need to be greedy. 
---
Everything is plentiful until you need it right then ;). I don't do an explosive build but I do try to do the daily challenges. Yesterday it was to make molotov cocktails. Oh, I need beer bottles and adhesive? That shouldn't be too hard. I found the adhesive I needed way before the beer bottles (That part took me 15 minutes. I spent like 45 minutes to an hour trying to find all the beer bottles).
---
All weapons need a buff or some sort of level scaling. With TSE practically dead, weapons aren't able to do jack shit to enemies now even with perk cards. Imagine going against 14 lvl 68 super mutants but you can barely scratch one down to 50% health unless you have a melee. 
---
We didn't need a Nerf right now, we needed a full redo on ALL weapons. But apparently melee needs a Nerf now because it's too good? It's the only reliable weapon now that can do damage even tho you can barely reach something with your attacks.
---
Don't just buff explosives buff literally everything.
---
Didn't they stop the stacking of bobbleheads and Rad-X?
---
Yeah, I made a post about the nerf/bug to vats crit that no one seems to care about and I also talked about stealth being messed up and gave several examples of what was happening.
---
But it got ignored and got zero traction because people were focused on their little bobby pins.
---
You've already made it clear that you have no interest in learning about or changing from being monetized to the detriment of gaming as a whole. Unless you have something new, stop replying.
---
Maybe add a weapons tab or simple inventory tab so I can start showing off that mini gun that I never use for any other reason and won’t drop for some reason. Imagine having your very own armory behind a steel wall with keypad locks
---
It's funny you should mention this. Between carry weight dynamic and storage space next time I hop online I plan on burning through my missiles and mini nukes just to get rid of them. I couldn't even sell them! I'll be hunting for super mutants and dumping the missile launcher in the dumpster.
---
1) Will you be balancing melee builds?
---
2) Could we get a respec event? 
---
It’s funny because zenimax owns Bethesda but no one blames them.
---
Same for me, built a large structure and saved a blueprint for the foundations and some walls and moved my camp and... no blueprints and all my foundations and walls were gone from the stored tab. There goes hundreds of mats.
---
I use three gatlings in my favorites and it only keeps one of the three - I have to reset the others every login.  Very frustrating!
---
I'm surprised you edited the comment, was not expecting that... thank you, that's honestly the nicest thing I've ever seen someone do here in response to my criticism. I hope I have as much grace if someone else criticizes me the next time I'm an ass. xD
---
&gt;drop no Lego
---
This should be added as an alternative to the punji board.
---
Maybe it's time for Bethesda actually "observe" how other online shooter game is able to turn around 
---
P.S. transparent communication
---
&gt;Since the beta I haven't had any major issues at all.
---
Now I'm confused.
---
 People keep telling me to pick the lock or there is no key and im stupid..... 
---
Fallout 76 Camp Venture weapons room key https://imgur.com/gallery/wFbNHyd
---
Killed about 4 of those but never seen a mothman
---
It's a bit disappointing beyond the initial "wow" though
---
I'd like them to fix Targeting HUD first so it doesn't cause crashes to you or the people around you.
---
But yeah, it needs to be more noticable, or at least a different color. Red highlights don't really help when you're in a Nuke zone with a Red filter on the area.
---
Corpses with contents in them should glow regardless of anything. Too many moving things in one small area in this game makes it impossible to find everything.
---
You sir are L U C K Y especially if you've really been playing since launch. I've been playing with friend since launch (stopped playing 2 weeks ago), and we have encountered at least 3 bugs average per session. In the beginning, we used to encounter 5 frustrating bugs not even 10 minutes into the game (damage bug, mutations not working correctly, camp bugs, graphical bugs, crashes, legendaries not giving legendaries, event bugs, quest bugs, SBQ bugs, etc.). It's a joke.
---
Facts that can change a discussion. I never imparted bias. 
---
Yeah I was thinking about that too. There are all times when the event fails randomly like the violent night event always failed for me when super mutants spawn as well. 
---
It shouldn't matter if a wooden stick does more damage.
---
I wanna be a cowboy baby
---
Soooo your bitter about explosive weapons because someone destroyed your base with them?, I've had my base destroyed WITH explosives on at least 5 different occasions and yet I've posted this trying to improve them because y'know trying to make the game fun and better for everyone.
---
You do realise the fat man has been in fallout since fo3 (or maybe even earlier I dunno) 
---
The impact stops at the player. Tell me and this is just a random example because I don’t know you but if you play call of duty and the developers did an amazing job at it. What did you get out of spending 100 hours in it besides enjoying yourself (which should be good enough reason don’t get me wrong).  Did it inspire you to do something other than playing? Did you enroll back in school? Did you decided that it was so inspirational it change your life around? Probably not. But there is literature out there strong enough to change people life in a good or bath way depending on what you read but my point is the level of impact that the art form has on an individual has a lot to do with its level of importance. 
---
My opinion that’s all:)
---
I agree with most… but you come across as a dick with the level cap things for SBQ &amp; Whitesprings. But yes, cabin campers suck during SBQ. 
---
I do 1k now and 4K before patch. :(
---
At least they can share adrenaline rank 5
---
Did you delete the save file in the system storage or the save file in the PS+ Cloud storage?
---
Making them free to join, to fix the bad UX of events being over when you join is not the answer, some kind of progress indicator or timer on events on the map is what they need.
---
I cant tell the world hasn't loaded yet
---
I've ran into this bug twice in the last week (including yesterday so I know it wasn't patched). When you're in a nuke silo and you initiate launch prep if the 3rd bot is destroyed by enemies the system will stall at 35%. You can relaunch the bot from the terminal, but the system progress will just be stuck at 35%. 
---
Another thing Bethesda will nerf.
---
&gt;So thus, server hopping to collect anything is an exploit. 
---
No, that is your guess, not something that Bethesda has said. Your "thus" is a non sequitur, and I repeat: BS.
---
I've spent way too many hours defending that teapot in the hopes of getting a specific plan that none of the vendors carry.
---
They do count for bandolier. It helps a lot
---
Same with harpoons and weirdly enough, cannonballs. I say weirdly enough since the broadsider is considered an explosive and isn’t affected by heavy gunner. Just seems strange to me 
---
1. PS4
---
2. Cristari
---
3. no pic/vid.
---
4. Powered Access Door - Brick keypad and power connectors on wrong side of wall.
---
When placing this wall the access pad is on the internal face of the wall, I.e. the plaster face. This wall also seems to be a lot thicker than the other brick wall pieces.
---
It would also be helpful to allow terminals to program the access code into the access pad. This should follow for the access pad item in the Advanced Connectors.
---
While we are on this subject we are also missing Barn, Warehouse and Steel versions of these walls. The Garage door is only available for Warehouse walls? Why can't we get Garage doors for Barn, Brick,  Warehouse and Wood walls?
---
5. No support ticket for this.
---
every single one of these replies does not point out the most obvious and best answer which is simple that eh Camp Module itself is no different than any other placed object in your camp.  Go into building mode, walk up to it, select, and switch to edit mode.  At this point you  can go place it anywhere you want just like you would with any other item you previously placed in your camp.  
---
Thank you OP.
---
Threads like this remind me of literally every patch or expansion of WoW I have seen since Burning Crusade. I played through most of them while managing restaurants for most of the last decade. When I went back to school after getting married and having kids my interest waned in WoW, not because the games were bad, but because the PLAYERS were such garbage. 
---
Always only concerned with endgame content, top tier builds, and bitching because their "loot grind sucked". They had the same voices as the soccermoms at the restaurants. Neither group had any appreciation for the Journey being more important than the destination nor any appreciation for the fact that no matter how many times they said "I could do your job in my sleep" "Is it so hard to cook a steak right?" as they put ketchup on a well done Filet Mignon sounded the exact same to me as these privileged children (and yes, if you spend your time playing video games, especially in the hundreds of hours range, you are privileged compared to most of the rest of the world which is much more concerned with SURVIVAL IRL) complaining about a game and "not getting their moneys worth" or "I am doing this for EVERYONE who spent money on it" when it is patently obvious that such altruism is at best a smokescreen to cover their tears of rage over their "endgame build" getting "nerfed" so that they have to WORK at the game like those plebians who haven't studied every statistic. 
---
Go out and get some exercise kids. That much rage and sitting in front of a screen sedentary is gonna kill you with a heart attack or worse sooner rather than later.....on second thought naaa, fire the lazers and sit right there and pour hate at me and maybe give the E.T. NES game a try. More peace and quiet that way in the long term.
---
Made two Whitespring runs this morning before work, had a couple legendary ghouls but not a single legendary drop.
---
Working as intended I guess. 
---
Maybe aid items too? At least things that aren't prepared/can spoil?
---
Would be neat to put some Nuka-Cola on display in my Vending Machine!
---
Or all the countless gameplay options and other things we can do in the game that they NEVER told us about… and isn’t available online either. We as the players were left to figure out the game with no instruction. 
---
Only bloody mess increases the base damage. 
---
Very likely. Let's just live in the moment
---
I agree with you for the most part, but the best way I can describe this map is bumpy. I regularly climb hills the size of The Throat of The World, after using mutations like marsupial I really noticed how much care they put into the cities too. It’s very fun climbing your way up rooftops and finding little secrets hidden away, albeit these were in earlier Bethesda games I think the landscapes have made a massive improvement!
---
That's in Toronto, though.
---
Yeah the bobby pin thing blew up when there are so many other underlying issues. Its too bad maybe thw hot fix could have done more if those posts weren't burried.
---
Yep. It's like skeletons in Skryim. 
---
Both iirc. But I might've just done it in system storage.
---
linking the indicator to health would not work, and could potentially lead to exploits.
---
Imagine you're fighting the SBQ - a timed event with a boss with health. If you have 10 seconds left in the event and if SBQ health was mostly full, the indicator would be green, suggesting you should go. Or if the SBQ was almost dead but plenty of time remained, it would be red. The indicator is not giving you enough information to make a good decision. Also, the SBQ regens health halfway through, so how would you know if you were at the very beginning, or at the mid point regen?
---
It's also reasonable to assume that people would join an event that was nearing a successful completion for the xp, so low level players could fast travel to the very end of a SBQ fight, exploiting the event.
---
They’re “looking into it”
---
The fact that 'Everything comes out with issues' does nothing to impact the discussion that certain issues should be fixed. Unless you are saying that the fact that other things have issues means that the expectation for issues to be fixed is unreasonable.
---
Thanks for sharing?...
---
It was a hyperbole comment there is no blitz perk but it is built into vats it's about 8 feet.
---
But does rifleman affect it as well?
---
This. The quest completes, but it's stuck on.
---
I tried the auto piston and the recoil was out of control. I don’t use VATS much but maybe I’ll give it another go with that approach. Outside of VATS  it’s impossible to keep on target 
---
Wouldn't all shots be hip fire at that point? or is that your point? Not trying to be mean.
---
Why not just remove the bonus damage on the card from the explosive bullet legendary? Still leaves them sought after 
---
Yes, but that is significantly less funny.
---
I agree with you that the game world is incredible in design, best of any fallout game by far, and marsupial means finally acrobatics is kinda back which i really missed from oblivion. I was just saying the space station looks so inviting but you can't go inside and there's nothing there of relevance except  a space suit and some low level mutants. At least give us a quest to scavenge something from it, I want more reasons to spend time there.
---
Ah okay, thanks for the clarification.  In the end though it was not an in-house project and didn't *feel* like a Bethesda game.
---
No power armour at all. I changed my outfits and armour a few times as well and nothing helped. 
---
I'm also trying to collect lead and steel too, not going very well. haha
---
Audio sound for picking produce no longer plays.  \*Clutches pearls\*  How am I to know that I've picked the fruit? (Watch this is one of the first things they address instead of the actual major issues.)
---
Well there never was endgame for us in the first place so the only enjoyment I’ve ever gotten was overpowered weapons. I don’t want to 6 shot every goddamn ghoul anymore. 
---
I just reached level 50 and now I have to spend 15 levels to get taming charisma perks because I have to reallocate my stats. Now it’ll take forever because exp and explosives were nerfed. I was a demolition build and they destroyed that because of tse. They had absolutely no reason to make other explosives useless. 
---
The nerfs will make survival lobbies fun because of fairness but until then I’m just gonna find something else. 
---
Ya ... people like you are what I'm worried about
---
You should test it out and let us know. Delete the system file first and then see if the settings reverted to default but everything else stay. Like characters and photos.
---
Then delete both and recheck.
---
The not so fun part is actively nuking your Character you've built up.
---
Same. Started happening right after hotfix. (PS4)
---
Yeah you get the benefits of all pistol perks and all rifle perks.
---
Even tank killer
---
They should buff weapons so they match melee. Perhaps make the more perception perks, the more damage you do with rifles like how strength is.
---
**As I understand the Quest:**   
---
POI061\_HouseOfScares "Crack the Code" \[QUST:004F82B8\]   
---
Which is the main quest line for "Kill a Wendigo while wearing a clown costume"  
---
It requires the following Armor Record to Complete:    
---
Clothes\_ClownOutfit "Clown Outfit" \[ARMO:0010CF7A\]  
---
Additionally the Following Outfit (Atom Store):  
---
ATX\_Clothes\_ClownOutfitClean "Clown Outfit" \[ARMO:0010CF7B\]  
---
Is missing the required keyword:  
---
HouseOfScaresOutfit \[KYWD:004F82BE\]
---
Now we have limited ability to troubleshoot and test, but based on Fallout 4's Quest systems, replacing the Armor Record with a FormList with both the Basic and AtomStore versions of the Clown Outfit, and Adding the Keyword to the Clean, AtomStore version of the Outfit should fix it.
---
Well Peter Hines has [confirmed](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vgr.com/fallout-76-microtransactions-hines/amp/) they are not going to include pay2win.  
---
However with the recent find of lunchboxes in the games files, this seems like it's going against what was said.  The fact Bethesda isn't answering this question raises some red flags. 
---
Yeah you can... build a doorway or windowed wall which allows the wire to pass thru first,  then when its placed and wired replace it with a solid wall... no problem... power is not cut. 
---
It's not a guess, it is perfect logic. But oh, you probably don't see yourself as an exploiter do you? You look down on those glitch using exploiters. You simply server hop to get what you want.
---
I may have to try this. But the selection of doors...
---
Power Armor HUD!!! Jesus Christ. I would actually wear PA if I didn’t have to use that atrocity they call a passing effort for a UI. That shit is horrendous. Great list. BGS will ignore this. But they’ll respond to someone saying how ‘water needs to be looked at’ or some shit. 
---
Also, is this just bolt action or the regular pipe rifle as well?
---
&gt; God I fucking hate self righteous entitled asswipes like you. 
---
I think people have all the right to get mad if they banned an acount for no reason at all that has a minimun of 60€ put in.
---
Another stealth sniper here, most of the stealth bugs are minor annoyances to me. But there are two that definitely impact my gameplay: staying in caution or danger, not able to get a sneak attack off and the escape artist perk hardly working.
---
This is certainly a much welcomed and appreciated post, but I'd absolutely love to see the developers comment on whether or not they've actually considered implementing text chat down the line, especially with the consideration that it would be the only method for a lot of players to communicate with one another in-game.
---
My base is on a giant cliff at the very bottom left of the map, you have to start walking south of the fissure site then go west on the fence line to climb up because there isn’t an access point from the west. It overlooks a huge valley and you an see all of asheap, pretty badass spot. 
---
They're working on a fix for this. It's my pet peeve too
---
Yeah sometimes I just don’t know what to think about this sub lol. We have issues with 2 playstyles that are actually viable alternatives to melee and they get ignored while we get 20+ upvoted posts about bobby pins, junk items, or people quitting.
---
Sigh*
---
That definitely disappoints me! I can remember when I was a low level and I saw Mount Blair off in the distance, I was getting so excited to trek there when I met somebody a little higher level than me that just let me fast travel there. We claimed the workshop and I was ecstatic to see it, but after realizing it’s only a few rooms and a wave defense I was pretty let down.
---
It would stack, but it’s a multiplier it doesn’t add. So it would either boost the damage by 30% then apply a 50% bonus on that new damage, or do it the other way around 
---
There is already a perk to reduce load time on those weapons.
---
Anyone actually playing an explosive build isn't using frag grenades, they are turning them into MIRVs or Nuka grenades which are very powerful.
---
Missile launcher condition indeed sucks. To me it is a niche weapon I use in conjunction with the zealot affix and a targeting computer to take down SBs easily, since all other explosive weapons fire in an arc which makes hitting SBs impossible until they land.
---
Heavy ordinance perk reduces weight, but mini nukes are still 0.6 which is pretty crazy.
---
Perks should not be made useless by bugs in my opinion.
---
The heavy guns reload perk and the heavy ordinance perk handle those complaints IMO.
---
If you think about it: It's just a DVD-Cover with a cardboard-CD, a keyboard layout instruction and DOOM/Rage2 advertising inside. Literally taking the controller, enter a code and throwing Fallout 76 in the trashcan.
---
Next time I wont buy a... physical copy? Waste of resources. :/

I try to use the sulfur drinking fountain if I can. It took me a while to find it because I kept looking at the center of the gazebo instead of the outer edge.
---
It's actually in a pretty good location. I usually get rad worms at the golf club, and the cure is only 100 feet away.
---
I'm pretty sure it works with all pipe weapons. I'll have to check.
---
Of course...it doesn't work with laser weapons because why would they get any love
---
Until people randomly quit blowing the crap out of camps, I am not sure that is a good idea. 
---
Yeah... so many people ranting and raving about Marrowind and FO3 like they are for Skyrim. That’s why Marrowind keeps getting re-released on every new gaming system and people keep buying it... sure... whatever you say...
---
On PC, I seen stashes fail to exist at known stash locations, only to appear as I was walking away (finder perk alerted me).  I've seen cap stashes with just a single cap.  I have seen plenty of cap stashes give no search option, and a few to initially give no search option only for that option to appear when I checked back moments later.  I've had stashes stop pinging when I looted them and stashes continue to ping after they are looted. 
---
"Snally Gaster and the Spit Attack Explosion" sounds like either a really great or really terrible all-wind instrument metal cover band.
---
If you are still taking suggestions, could something be done with the perk card packs every 5 levels?  Specifically around the cards that only have one rank (Science, Green Thumb, Professional Drinker, Travel Agent, etc,etc,etc).
---
Once I have one of those cards a second card has NO value whatsoever.  If a lookup could be done to exclude the card from possible cards in the pack it would improve the experience.  
---
I would get excited 2 levels before a pack to see what I get - even if it wasn't relevant to my play style.  This last pack (for Lv 75, so not talking 300+ here) had 2 single level duplicates.  Both of which came from previous card packs (a second Prof Drinker card when I have Endurance 2 and it requires 3.. really?!  Are you trying to give me a hiht I need to start drinking?)
---
This amazing Ive got a nice two shot in my inventory. Its super light as well.
---
100% agreed. Favorite weapon in the same. Shame only bloody mess boosts damage.

Here at Muhthesduh we value our communities input and appreciate your concerns about the state of heavy weapons weight restrictions and damage capacity in relation to other options in game. Rest assured we have looked into these issues and believe we've found a solutions that will make you all very happy. &lt;pause for non existent applause &gt; Next month we will be releasing explosive based dye packs to the Atom shop! No longer will you have to settle for the boring colors of the base line fire effects. Now a full rainbow of firey death will be available at your fingertips for the low cost of 1200 atoms per color. Now I know what you're thinking , "how will these new colored flames not conflict with the lore of the game?". our answer is It just works. "ok ... then will the colors apply to all your explosives or can you mix and match  for each weapon?" Rest assured It just works. ,"But that didn't answer our question... can we use the dye packs on our clothes and armor?" Trust us it just works!,"But..." and now just to show you how much we listen and care for your concerns and our lore we have begun work on incorporating a new monster type ... Dragons!

I’ve also noticed that my crit bar doesn’t go up at all when I’m unloading a ton do gullets in vats. But after I use my crit it just waits till I have no more AP and then it appears that I have a full crit meter again.
---
If you're naive to this then the amount of people working will not be beneficial to you, because you don't understand how many people you need for the job. Instead you should be asking if Bethesda is prioritizing this team correctly. And the answer appears to be no. 
---
If you damage someone elses property you are responsible for repairing it yes.
---
In the real world, pistols have less range and less accuracy and less stopping power than rifles.
---
I understand that some players want Bethesda to ignore the real world, and yes, this is a fantasy game in which Momma Murphy can kill one Deathclaw with one bullet from a pipe pistol. 
---
But even in terms of game balance in this fantasy realm, unless and until a pistol has the other downsides of a rifle — including weight, bulk, expense — pistols *ought* to be weaker, unless we're going with magic on top of fantasy.
---
The defense quest there is excruciating too because it usually spawns like 3 waves of robots, and the protectrons spawn all the way at the bottom of the dig machine and walk slowly slowly up the walkways to the top, takes them probably 20 minutes to ge t to the top. And if they find a door on the way they will stop to destroy it. You have to run around the whole thing multiple laps with VATS every wave to find them all, only to find an eyebot is at the top now shooting at your workshop. Never worth the effort in my experience, Wade airport is much better if you want a high budget workshop with lots of space.
---
Maybe later, when we can sell our things in machines, but if someone does not like it, you can deactivate it or not create the object.
---
I would like mine to work more than 50 percent of the time 
---
Definitely need better variety. Bring in some pistols from FO 1 &amp; 2, like the .223 pistol, and boost the hell out of the Alien Blaster like it's supposed to be.
---
No, he was just walking around. Didn't had the animal friend perk card at this time.
---
The weapon balancing really needs to be revisited, the TS(e) Adjustment completely Gutted the Demo based builds (not using TSE weapons) and made the already "Niche" Missile Launcher and Fatman completely worthless.  
---
This has actually been a bug since the beta, but whenever I or any other person tried to raise this issue, we were simply dismissed and downvoted by this subreddit.
---
There's also an issue with ranged sneak damage not applying to enemies, especially if other players are nearby. It's probably a server-to-client sync issue.
---
On Xbox the brick powered keypad door has the keypad and power connectors on the wrong side.

It still works but uhhh, I'd prefer the keypad to be on the outside. I don't like leaving my doors open to strangers.
---
They said they're going to buff the laser weapons and explosive weapons in the future. 
---
There is a red scare but it is not from China. The call is coming from inside the house.
---
Same here. But I am still upset at the near constant display of incompetence by Bethesda. 
---
I like it. Maybe an option in the game play settings, like pacifist, to turn your C.A.M.P. location on or off. I feel like that could encourage more player trades and interaction.  If we could have a guild of sorts, we can let the community know we are selling or in need of things, or just throwing a C.A.M.P. party, lol! 
---
In the last two days, I seen stashes fail to exist at known stash locations, only to appear as I was walking away (finder perk alerted me).  I've seen cap stashes with just a single cap.  I have seen many cap stashes give no search option, and a few to initially do so only for the option to appear when I checked back moments later.  I've had stashes stop pinging when I looted them and stashes continue to ping after they are looted. 
---
Blah. I have a hard enough time making regular ammo for my handmade :(
---
For me, for the most part, it wasn't really bad.  A few annoyances, but bearable.  
---
But ever since (I think it was the patch on the 11th?) I have consistent disconnects on PS4.  I go to fast travel to an event: disconnect.  I go to leave a building: Disconnect.  I get killed and go to respawn: Disconnect.  
---
Of course the last one is most annoying since I have lost my junk I've dropped as a result of it.  
---
I would normally question my connection, but to the best of my knowledge doing ping tests, it should be fine, so it seems server side during the game itself.  Some people blamed dupers, but then it continued to happen after the last patch that was supposed to stop all the duping... so I don't know, I don't even want to try anymore.  
---
In the most recent issue/bug log, Bethesda themselves have admitted that they are still having issues and looking into it.
---
And honestly, of all the things in the game, that is my biggest issue.  When I was able to play the game, I enjoyed it, but I'm so frustrated with not even being able to complete a simple quest like the DMV one since the quest requires to you enter and leave the building a couple of times, and at least once during those times causes the game to disconnect, and results in the quest going back to step 1
---
Oh anti-vaxxers are definitely in a different league of horrible, but since you can't put 2 and 2 together, let's go over the similarity checklist.
---
Frothing hostility: Check
---
No desire to hear evidence that you're wrong: Check
---
Willful Ignorance: Check
---
Hurt what you love because of poor actions: Check
---
Considering this has been your reaction twice, I'm just going to assume all further comments of yours are just going to be Facebook levels of insulting, so pardon me if I don't reply further.
---
Not for nothing, but you can't be banned for knowing people who are assholes in a game my dude. You sound like a genuine psycho.
---
It’s bizarre tbh, the short fall of pistols in real life is their relatively short range and lower accuracy (due to shorter barrel) a desert eagle would be an awesome edition to the game so I can run about like Dirty Harry 
---
That’s the biggest pain, I’m more into claiming and defending workshops once for the plans rather than the resources though, to be honest I’m kinda filled to the brim with anything workshops could give me lol thanks for the tip though!
---
Must not be for you then.
---
Trying to bring some levity to an over serious forum with a story of us having some fun. 
---
I've created my share of poorly designed shit boxes too.
---
I also sold my gun by mistake, my hats did not reach me to buy it again. We should have a button, to recover what we sell by mistake as wow 
---
I really didn't hit any walls or lose anything until I hit the point where you start to grind nukes. My first attempts at a solo or small party launch, we all disconnected. It sucked but other than that, I've had the same experience. If I lost an item, you can easily get another one. 
---
I've seen people are complaining about losing level 25 legendaries and armor and stuff and it leaves me thinking, who gives a shit? 
---
There are 2 possibilities. 1 is that there is a younger generation here who has access to the internet and low experience with video games, so ANYTHING that happens is a big deal. 2 is that there is a cult of folks that want to watch the game burn for the sake of it. These 2 items feed into each other and you get reports of glitched items or stolen power armor and dumb stuff like that
---
Explosive bobbleheads...
---
They clearly just rolled the long-game of lead poisoning into one immediate impact.  /s
---
Do you?  Because I assure you, nobody needs to jump online and go save your sorry ass.
---
There's one spot where a couple of low level ghouls, one of which is a ghoulfer, spawn regularly.
---
As best I can remember he's in the black box on this map:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/xh2QlWx](https://imgur.com/a/xh2QlWx)
---
He dies very often quickly however because there are bots patrolling the area that will swiss cheese him. I know if you're inside the objective circle you're not far enough up in the corner of the area; I generally saw him running across one of the cart paths towards one of the northern most entrances. 
---
I also get this bug where I am not only in stealth and it says caution but when I shoot it says I get my sneak attack damage buff (2.5 and 3.5 at night). But the enemy’a health bar drops and then shoots back up to only my normal guns dmg. Super frustrating.
---
So how long did it take for ESO to not be a shitshow? Because I'm pretty confident that there wasn't new problems every week or old problems resurfacing 2 months after the initial release.
---
love that fucking game!
---
This is the worst, especially when you've gone through the silo solo. Rinsed all your ammo and stimpacks trying to push through the silo and take out the SBQ and the server disconnects. It's happened to me twice, there's nothing more infuriating 
---
That's what most people say but you have to factor in that the 184 damage is with the 20% reduction against everything else applied so it would be 184 x 1.2 x1.5 to get the actual damage
---
You swap perks a lot?  I caught myself accidentally drop something while swapping perks because the key for perks and the key for dropping are right next to each other on PC.  I dunno how it is on PS4 though.  I lost my max level Bunker Buster and I dunno how but I assume I did this by accident.  Really don't know though and it really fucking sucks.
---
Funny you say that because I’ve definitely killed myself more than other players / AI have killed me.. lol double radius on mini nukes leaves VERY little room for error, on top of that the game is just flat out glitchy. Sometimes nukes get caught in the air and explode at half distance, and that is pretty much a guaranteed suicide. 
---
However, I recently started farming mutations and marsupial is BEAST for my build because I can easily jump away from blasts / on top of things for a much better vantage point. It’s hilarious because I’ll just go up on a rooftop or in a tree or something and I’m essentially untouchable. Even if you have a fancy jetpack or marsupial, good luck getting up to me lol 
---
All I can say is, through gritted teeth, "I am happy for you" while really just being envious. I have several disconnects per week, and I don't even play that much. I'm only level 47, for instance. 
---
As someone who takes public work benches regularly, it is very disheartening.
---
Marcus May have gotten a hooker pregnant in fallout 2
---
Oh there is and we the community have been posting em all the time.  
---
That list is more of an Acknowledged list.
---
Their response has basically been we cannot track specific items in your inventory, so we cannot restore lost items, have a nice day. It’s also why they cannot track duplicated items and have to rely on other triggers like mass crafting or weight. 
---
But that wasn't a frkng mistake: the game just decided to sell something else, not what was on screen (not even mentioning not what I clicked at).
---
I don’t have any two shots but def notice a big difference in how fast my weapons with exploding damage degrade after patch. 
---
Also pairing this with a zealot's weapon can do some serious damage (well about the same as 2 shot now but for all i know the bonuses could stack or something ridiculous)
---
&gt;the escape artist perk hardly working.
---
Pretty much this, hopefully we get Bethesda to actually look at this or give some idea why it is so inconsistent.  
---
I've seen the community one, but the official one is the one I would like to see. 
---
Of course I want the game to be better, and if you ask me, it's been getting better and will continue to get better. Not the same company, but just look at ESO, it is nearly a completely different gaming experience than when it was a beta. Some people just wanna complain and be mad because it's not perfect to their specific liking. I even have a cousin who has never even played the game but is right along with others talking shit about it. Don't like it? Don't play. Sorry you lost your $60 but that's a risk you take buying any game before it has been out for a while. We've all lost an entire set of power armor, it sucks but it's OK because it's just game, and the game is still fun. 
---
It's even crazier that you **can** upgrade the mistress of mysteries pistol and sword. But as far as I know, thare are the **only** quest legendaries that can be upgraded.
---
Completed Mayor for a Day sub-50? enjoy a weaker version of one of the best melee weapons in the game sucker.
---
Same here, was hitting a a level 62 achorched with a zealots grognak axe and the damn thing just keep on regenerating its health. I usually just hit em twice with a power attack with said weapon. 
---
Meanwhile at Bethesda HQ "so what your saying is we should nerf (insert fun thing here) till it's a tedious slog in the next patch excellent idea"
---
I am really disappointed in the state of this game.....I am personally pulling for Bethesda, as I am a Maryland native, but why are they doing things to make it not fun?  Where is their QA process.....I am sad for the state of the game industry right now.
---
Yeah they’re only level 9. You also don’t get anything for completing the quest. Unless having it no longer be on your screen after 3 weeks is it’s own reward, but... 
---
Awesome! I learned so many tricks from your Fallout 4 videos! 
---
Same here. No atoms yet. 
---
No, I read your comment in its entirety. You said that there was no proof whatsoever that some of the game breaking bugs from before have made it back, which is blatantly false. The obvious one is that the old duping method that was patched has made a return. Pretty sure when you can bring back the black market much easier for powerful items, the problem's back and the game is broken.
---
Missile Launchers and Fatmen were never really that great...
---
Notice how many of the crappy weapons don't have many damage-boosting modifications (Laser has the sniper barrels, there are a couple for the minigun, the fatman has the MIRV, which is like an alternative variant rather than a direct upgrade. Idt the missile launcher has any). Perhaps adding a receiver-equivalent mod slot for these weapons might be the best way to buff them.
---
Because if you compare the level 20 variant of the missile launcher to the level 25 variant of the lever gun, the missile launcher does double damage. Where it falls apart however, is the late game. Demo expert only gave it an 40% advantage, which felt like a band-aid of a solution imo.
---
Lmao 🙌🙌
---
Ahh, to be level 1-15 again. So much content ahead of you to look forward too. 
---
I miss those days.
---
I hate this change, but the nodes by my camp arent even respawning daily now. 2 did respawn in 24 hours, the other two, directly next to them took 3 days. 
---
yes, it's a damn problem, sometimes the game does not react in time, I end up selling more items than I planned, or even others 
---
Yep, stealth sniper here, can confirm.  
---
I'm almost 100% sure its an issue surrounding enemy perception.  
---
Notice how hitting a single Ghoul causes 100% of all nearby ghouls to converge on you?  This is an intentional mechanic to make the enemy more dangerous and challenging.  
---
Other enemies also do this, but it's less noticeable than ghouls especially when it's a ranged enemy.  So if you shoot one super mutant, all nearby become alerted to your presence.  
---
What I believe is happening is basically the code that makes enemies aware of you when you attack is affecting enemies that are much farther away than intended.  So basically if I hit one super mutant say at the entrance of west tek research, one of the enemies way off in the back becomes aware of me and thus I'm in "caution" even though that enemy was way too far to get alerted to me in the past.  
---
I notice that in a lot of cases once I kill every single enemy in a given location I finally get back to "hidden", which seems to confirm my hypothesis above.  
---
In some cases when I can't seem to get back to hidden no matter what I think it's tied to invisible enemies or enemies that spawned trapped inside objects, below the ground etc.  In one case at whitesprings I saw this in action: I had cleared all enemies I could find but was stuck in "danger".  I managed to find the enemy causing it by following the dot on my radar but the enemy was invisible.  I could even get the enemy to pop up in red letters but there was nothing there, I was literally looking at empty space.  
---
Only way I could get back to hidden was  to enter a new cell, in that case I went to the enclave bunker and it was back to normal.
---
They should make it like fallout 3 where you select a bunch of stuff and then confirm when you are sure it's all the right stuff.
---
And they can tell us they are ‘aware of it’ forever and forever and it’s like some magic little phrase that means they can move on to making the Atom Store even more fun! Being aware of the ‘Feed the People hopper’ bug since BETA. Yup. Still aware of it. 
---
Silver shroud isn't 
---
Not sure i like the idea of money for more slots but i guess its a possibility.
---
Before you go that path you know you can make all those builds on just one lad?. My lad is only 130 and i have shotgun, melee, heavy, healer, camp builds. With even more in the works if i really wanted to.
---
I’ve already done this but add a spoiler tag please!
---
That's true, but it doesn't negate the need that if you want something that fixes thirst, you should be able to view just items that will do that, or at least be able to sort items so that different benefits are logically grouped together. 
---
The core problem is whenever you are looking at the AID tab, you are only looking for one of four things (Food, water, health/hp, or buff items) and don't care about anything else in the list. Honestly just having a better naming convention would go a long way, but a big issue with that is the one you mention: there's many food items that also provide HP, or water, or even buffs, so sorting by the core name doesn't easily show you \*everything\* that might help you out.
---
That's why I think the best solution would be to have sub-tabs or something under AID that would list anything that applied to FOOD/WATER/HP/BUFFS, and anything that provided more than one would be listed under multiple of those tabs. Food and water overlap enough that I'd settle for having them on one tab, but I'd still like to easily be able to find water in a big list of food items.
---
The level 50s don't seem to be but the 80s absolutely suck. Had to solo 3 yesterday because, well I was there first. It took forever. Ammo wise 240 or so 556 and 183 shotgun shells. Fortunately I was up high and was able to use the crest of a roof to avoid some of the Sonic spam and blast them when they landed.
---
The best part is, three people spawned in and noped out leaving a lot of scorched to clean up when I took the three birds out. I was loaded to the gills with crap for my vendor run, but one of the two legendary guys disappeared into thin air.
---
🤔
---
I still get people messaging me asking to update the list lol.
---
Do you have the egg head mutation? I've found that affects this.
---
Saw a guy dressed as Grognak wearing red heels last night.  No more psycho for me for a while.
---
Git gud
---
YES!  
---
I want to show off all the teddy bear flavors. I even found a "bird decoration" that I'm hanging on to, just in case. The CAMP building minigame is sometimes frustrating, but I end up spending a lot of time making a place that is fun for other people to drop by and use/see--I even have a guesthouse. Not only do I want to show off my stuff, I really want to see what other people choose to decorate their CAMPs with. CAMPs make the wasteland a lot more interesting due to differences in personal design; further decorating would give us more to see, more to visit, more to talk about.
---
Was there a higher level player in the area? Enemies tend to get scaled up ive noticed.
---
Noticed this myself this AM. Logged in, crouched and "caution"
---
I keep medical privacy
---
Clutter makes it look like a home. 
---
My friends and I like the idea of static camp décor items like magazine and teddy bear shelf displays that require the player to collect one of each item in the set as the crafting materials. 
---
Kitchen counter displays with a breadbox and salt &amp; pepper shakers
---
Stacks of plates and glassware
---
Purified water and non perishable foods to put in actual kitchen cabinets
---
Refrigerators with static nuka cola shelf displays
---
Pot and pan hanging racks
---
Soap, toothbrush, and toothpaste bathroom sets
---
An actual bathroom sink to put those on
---
With an actual bathroom mirror
---
And as predefined clustered static objects they would take up so little budget. 
---
&gt; Don't like it? Don't play.
---
AGAIN, that is not a valid argument when money was spent. I will not accept losing my $60. I will accept no less than getting my money's worth and I will remain vocal until the game reaches the proper state. I'm sorry you're so quick to roll over and give up, but many of us are not.
---
I actually have this full set now. I posted this awhile ago, and i'm still confident in saying its one of, if not the most rare piece of apparel in the game
---
Monsters spawn in areas based on the level of the player that first entered.  Sometimes a player walks by and doesn't stay around to kill stuff, you enter and they are much higher.
---
Places like the Cranberry Bog, Savage Divide, and Mire don't have any real max cap.  So high level players going to vendors or quest locations but ignoring the rest of the area can make level 60+ spawn, and stay.
---
Places like Ash Heap, Forest, and Toxic Valley, have limits to how high the enemies can spawn.
---
There's no real way to know ahead of time, so you just have to be aware of your surroundings when you enter an area.
---
I have the same issue myself, I finally gave up trying.
---
It does not affect its weight.
---
"few hours to play per day in the best cases"
---
... after the family all goes to bed and after I should probably be asleep myself too.
---
 (at least that's how i play while juggling life)
---
PC?
---
I noticed that whatever my mouse is pointing at even after i’ve clicked to sell/store another item it will choose what is being pointed at when you press ok.
---
What's your issue, both are really good games.
---
I’ve had that happen but I just thought it was me 
---
Shit good to know, hopefully they’ll fixit. 
---
Are you a sniper build? What gun do you use for CQC? 
---
I want to use pistols but my AGI is stacked. 
---
I've been looking for the spear plans and have been unable to find them at any vendor.
---
there's absolutely no way you don't work in PR. the burden of proof is on you, since you're the one making absurd statements, yet you want me to make your case for you.
---
&gt;every game has disconnects
---
true, but you're downplaying. dcs are infinitely worse in Fo76 than any other triple A game. fact.
---
&gt;comparing the final boss crashing to enemies slipping into the ground
---
downplaying again, the final boss is an important aspect of any game and having it crash at least half the time is unacceptable.
---
&gt;cc information leaked but it's fine because no one was harmed
---
I don't even know what to say about this one except that companies get audited and go out of business for slips like this.
---
&gt;other mmos introduce patches that break things
---
downplaying yet again, no mmo introduces patches that break (unrelated) things 100% of the time unlike Bethesda. bonus points for taking months to fix simple things modders get right in an afternoon.
---
&gt;PR is better than other games
---
categorically untrue. canvas bags, essays, no refunds, rum, ban tickets not being answered within the timeframe set by Bethesda themselves. PR in Fo76 is a major reason why journos target it so often.
---
&gt;all of this happened to D3, GTA5 and WoW
---
also categorically untrue. *some* of it happened to *each* of those games *separately* and also in a much smaller scale.
---
like I said, the burden of proof in on you. nothing I just typed is wrong.
---
What do you mean replaces your underarmor? It isn't worn over the armor like a clown outfit for example? Thanks for posting, probably another 'sloppy' bug like the headlamps
---
The antennae that emits a radio signal to call for Settlers in Fallout 4 might be a good idea, with the added feature of signal strength promt
---
not sure what is/is not working but you are right, weapons are breaking MUCH faster now than they were pre-patch.  And before someone responds with "they break faster because you have to fire them more with the TSE nerf"...no, that does not explain what is happening.  Pre-patch I would maybe need to repair my TS Lever once per night.  Now I have to repair it on an almost hourly basis.  I am not firing 5X more rounds then I was before yet I am repariing it 5x as often.  
---
Here is what I am going to do this evening after work.  I will shoot into the sky over and over until the white-line is gone from a fully repaired rifle and count the number of bullets used.  First time will be with all of the relevant perk cards slotted and then I'll do it again without those cards to compare the results.  I suspect I will find that those cards are barely functioning right now. 
---
Ehh. If you don't value any semblance of a story to a game and are okay with running out of things to do after the main quest and your first SBQ kill go for it. I'd wait a year and see what it's like then, but right now there's really not much more to it than maybe three weeks worth of gaming, which for that price is still more than reasonable.
---
Thanks :D People are more likely to read something if it's properly formated.
---
3 people, a monkey, and a Grandmother. 
---
People exaggerate, especially on Reddit. Yes there are server and crashing issues sometimes, but almost any other online game has similar issues in the first few months.
---
The hate circlejerk for this game is still strong, and problems it has are blown way out of proportion for the most part. 
---
One good recent example is the TSE nerf. People had guns that could kill anything in the game with zero challenge. Now they’re “quitting” in droves because their instawin button is gone. 
---
Thank you very much i'll check it out for sure. 
---
It's really frustrating, eh!?
---
Made by a single man!
---
yep, PC
---
Have you taken a SBQ down since the update? It was hard but possible with TSE weapons. Only the bobblehead stack made it easy. Now it is simply a bullet sink with no reward so expect every nuke to be in Whitesprings until they do something about this.
---
I have had almost every mutation stop working the past day or so. Healing factor has not worked at all which ended up screwing me last night when I realized I had been running around with next to no health and it not regenerating. Marsup was bugged on one server, hopped to another and speed demon stopped working and Marsupial came back. One step forward 8 steps back as usual
---
I have no desire to respec back and forth, grinding levels just for that purpose.
---
I want to be able to log in to a build and go, not spend a week respecting when I want to change on a whim.
---
Maybe it's time to throw this game in the trash with no way to retrieve it.
---
Bethesda bad. Give upvotes and gold
---
It truly is and the Twitter support staff is also of no help with this issue.
---
I really liked the scenery at Twin Lakes. Nothing out of the ordinary, just nature, but it seemed like someone put a lot of effort into getting it just right.
---
Tanagra Town is something really special and unusual. A bit of a Star Trek easter egg, but a lot more than that.
---
Run run run jump
---
Why doesn’t the Scorchbeast Queen drop these plans instead since Ultracite can be crafted by tons of people if you lose the plans
---
Whatever it is, its too many. This game is a lost cause and it would be better for Bethesda at this point to just trash it.
---
I can’t sell it. 
---
LMAO yep exactly those fucking guys just don't get it
---
Uh, yeah explosive weapons are kind of a hot mess, lol. I actually heard about that cannonball thing the other day for the first time, myself.
---
Thats good. Im so glad i was extremly lucky with two acrobat 3* armor drops. It helps sooo much. 
---
not to be a downer, but this will never happen. None of the games based off this engine have ever had any sort of working/moving world functions. the best we might get is free fast travel between stations.
---
I have max gunsmith, weapon artison perks and submachine gun modded short light barrel, large drum, reflex, compensator. I mowed down a nonglow ghoul horde at whitespring but by second reload the submachine gun waa unusable and needed repair.
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_  
---
I could be wrong, but based on Fallout 4's quests..  
---
FF06\_Feed "Event: Feed the People" \[QUST:0009210E\]  
---
Uses the following formID list to filter what qualifies what can be placed in the container.  
---
FF06\_Feed\_IngredientFormList \[FLST:004F52C7\]   
---
Could the three items on the list be replaced with a Keyword to use as a Filter, added to the  
---
FF06\_Feed\_Ingredient\_Meat "Meat-flavored Soy Chunks" \[MISC:004F6DB5\]  
---
FF06\_Feed\_Ingredient\_Stock "Dehydrated Beef Stock" \[MISC:004F6DB3\]  
---
FF06\_Feed\_Ingredient\_Vegatables "Diced Vegetable Mix" \[MISC:004F6DB6\]  
---
Again just going by Fallout 4 as a base to test, that should filter the acceptable items for the Hopper to those food items
---
Well, I did look into it before deleting. Not really wanting to "nuke" the uber hours of progress, lol. Perhaps if you doubt it, you should give it a try.
---
[Grain of Salt](https://segmentnext.com/2018/10/08/fallout-76-manual-saves/)
---
"According to Hines, players will have to pick the game up from where it will respawn them and there won’t be any manual saves. Pete added that the game’s progression is constantly updated and the will be saved by “us”.
---
Now, the word is quite specific which indicates that there won’t be any local saves but the game will save on Bethesda’s server using the cloud.
---
Take it as a grain of salt until Bethesda confirms it. But, if the saves are stored on the cloud then it will present a problem for the players. It is likely that Fallout 76 will feature both local and cloud saves.
---
The reason why Fallout 76 won’t feature manual saves is that it is a multiplayer title not a single-player. So it makes sense that the game itself or server will save the game instead of the player."
---
Nice to see someone taking a scientific approach to things, rather than the fan "EVERYTHING IS BROKEN! WORST GAME EVAR!!!1!" or the dev "NERF EVERYTHING!!!1!" approach. 
---
Major issues for me would be anything that keeps me from playing the game, quests, etc. I never really had any issues like that.. during the beta they put out an update that fixed a lot of the framerate issues I had at first, but they didn't push that update when the game went live, I guess it created issues with quests or something..
---
So the first few weeks the game was out, without that update it was a little rough. Then there was an update the same day we got a PS4 firmware update- that's when I started getting crashes when I would mess around in my stash too much, only when I had legendaries stored in it- I moved them all to a mule character and that fixed that issue for me.
---
It's been over a month since they did an update that fixed those crashes, and it's been more and more stable since. Rock solid since two updates ago, zero issues.. but by then my friends and I were just burnt out.
---
What's been funny is I've been called a fan boy for not having issues when I honestly didn't know this game existed or was coming out until a few days before the ps4 beta, a friend convinced me to watch videos- turns out the people who had access before that lied a ton.
---
I put 5 bucks down on the game at GameStop which got me the beta code, and although I wish they included more content initially, I feel like I got my money out of it.. at least knowing that the dlc is free, unlike other games that want to charge you for installments of what feels like content that belonged in the base game.
---
That's a big deal to me, if they *did hold back content* from release, they aren't charging us for it later. I'd rather be playing sooner knowing the content will come..
---
Better business bureau.  
---
Might as well remove all the weapons and give us balloons at this rate...
---
It’s been too long, I forgot they look like that. I think I like that homemade-in-the-wasteland look more.
---
Pretty sure you get XP and caps, but it's been a while since I did it on my first character, so don't quote me on that.
---
Luck - good for you!
---
I know I’m almost a day late but I have to ask; are you using healing factor? Before, healing factor didn’t affect stimpaks but it does now.
---
steam might not, but various of the publishers that are do. 
---
might be a stupid question, but can't you just turn the door around?
---
If you on PC I have an X01 cal shock to trade...
---
2 people. They're both very confused.
---
Ohhh! That could be it! It’d also explain why the BB has exactly one more point of damage.
---
\+1   
---
Also could it "partially" repair, if we are short on Materials it would be fantastic if it could fix what it could.
---
I hope they get Wyatt Cheng for their next E3.
---
Or find crafting services  on (this)[https://discord.gg/5wUr7n] Discord server. It’s simple and fast enough. Some of crafting services are free, only mats require.
---
bruh that area sounds a little too tough for you now..im level 53 and lvl 62 charred ghouls def still give me a problem..try grinding a little in a less crazy area..i personally..like those areas for leveling up..but it seems too hard for you right now..there were other high-level players in the area which caused the 62 to spawn..im familiar with these things because ive been chilling in whitesprings since level 15
---
Maybe just an option to turn it off even...
---
No they shouldn’t.
---
*Very* interesting, thank you.
---
Playing with people makes it a lot easier but f that’s not an option you kinda just gotta grind 
---
Lol at all of the fellow banned hater friends he brought in. You know you’re telling the truth and calling out their shit when the only response they can muster are childish insults 😁
---
\+1....
---
Old as hell Bug reported in the Beta.
---
I wouldn't mind having a disease cure pod at my C.A.M.P. We already have decontamination shower. Medic pods already exists in the game and the animation for it. Please Bethesda, please please please...!!!
---
Person 1: Hurry up with the hotfix or I'm quitting this game forever!
---
Person 2: Take your time with the update, and get it right.
---
You can't please everyone.
---
I actually live at Twin Lakes hehe. First time i saw it i fell in love with the place. Now i have a neat little house in the water.
---
Never heard of Tanagra Town ill give it a look.
---
The photo i took of the monorail elevator is by far my favorite. Love this thing. 
---
You on pc?, grab loadout manager and swap on the fly. Levels are easy to get just on my daily mat,event and daily grind i net a few without touching nuke zones.
---
But up to you i guess i don't think this is a great path for them to travel. I think sticking to the atom store cosmetic items is best. Everything else is a rocky road.
---
im glad to know im not the only one experiencing this.
---
Yeah, your probably right about the weight limit introduction, I didn't think of that. 
---
So rely on RNG from a boring and lame task or rely on RNG from a quest that will imply to use tons of ammo with no guaranteed chance if success...
---
F ME Damn it, I am going to try this out, I hope you mean before the hot fix and it reverted back to the old way. 🤯
---
Border walking was the first thing I did in FO76 and I found him on a high cliff at the right map border. Huge swampy/water area beneath it. There is a path and some wooden bridges/stairs to reach the top. This is the location, if I remember right, I think it wasn't near Thunder Mountain power plant. ;P : [https://i.imgur.com/1aTGfBK.png](https://i.imgur.com/1aTGfBK.png)
---
Yeah thanks to my enclave underarmor I lose carryweight when I climb into powerarmor. 
---
It's a bit annoying.
---
Well, I'm done. Constant nerfs to make the game more grindy and to punish my favorite build (pistols/no power armor) even more? A patch that introduces MORE bugs than it fixes? Fuck this. Bethesda is done. This game shows they have no idea how to properly code, manage, or balance a game. There are amateur devs out there that do a better job at all three things than the entire team at Bethesda does.
---
I've never regretted the purchase of a game more.
---
Aaah well that solves that mystery lol.
---
I have a better idea, how about they just nurf YOU specifically since many of us don't have 50, 10, or even 5 fusion cores and can't find them very often now
---
And no, leaving something behind just lets them know somebody was there.
---
I get that. It was my first post to the sub. You're trying to make the most of the game. Have fun. Personally i can't express my disappointment enough. Bethesda has ruined my trust. That's all i came to say
---
Youre not in the majority (if it even is the majority) so you must be in denial because everyone thinks the same
---
Thats basically what youre saying right?
---
People can enjoy playing a game other people hate
---
The point being someone somewhere will be guaranteed able to craft the items you need
---
They are pretty rare compared to fallout 4, but yeah they exist! :) 
---
This seems insanely high. I have full 3 star vanguard and ironclad, barb, and evasive and not even close to this
---
Four different outfits are needed for maximum bonus though. That's my point. To achieve the full bonus, 3/4 of the items *must* be purchased.
---
I agree it's not a major issue as it is, but it is launching us down a dangerous path.
---
Would you be fine with next week 50% bonus damage for people with a weapon skin? Affordable! Then the following week, another shop-exclusive bonus, followed by another and another. Eventually it's not sustainable on "earned" atoms yet it has been slowly introduced over time to minimize player outcry.
---
They specifically said they wouldn't do this before the game launched. Additionally, how do you think the game will push those items? They'll balance all aspects of the game around people with bonuses to nudge the rest in that direction, like every other microtransaction game around.
---
Dangerous precedent, in my opinion. I hope I'm not right, but I'm afraid we'll be looking at this post in 6 months remembering when the game wasn't in such a shit, greedy state.
---
Haha
---
I could, but the inside isn't brick. Its white cement. So it looks kind of goofy.
---
That's fine for hardcore/serious gamers but we're talking casuals here, not the you and me types.
---
You may have saved the day👍
---
I asked for something from Bethesda which says server hopping is an exploit.
---
You produced nothing from Bethesda which says server hopping is an exploit.
---
Now you've doubled down and accused *me* of something. You're full of crap, sir or madam, and I repeat: I call BS. This concludes our conversation.
---
During my session last night I was walking the tracks looking for undiscovered map markers to “find” and had the thought, “Us vault dwellers are tasked with rebuilding western society. Surely there are those of us that were engineers/mechanics/etc. before the war - and were clearly being pushed to reestablish a capitalistic society. Why has no one ventured to repair and re-open the railroad?”
---
I know it’s currently impossible. But it would be REALLY cool if train stations were workshops that you could claim, trains were items that you could repair (like vertibots and AA turrets), and if you own consecutive train stations... you can run your train between those stations, and charge a price of your own choosing to other players.
---
This would not only create a new set of highly desirable/profitable workshops... but would also encourage teamwork to capture as many stations as possible. Alternatively it would encourage a lot more PvP in teams trying to steal owned stations because of their value. I think it would add a lot of validity to the role play aspect of the game. 
---
&gt;... a timer on the map doesn't necessarily give you all the info you'd need...
---
So you've decided to give us no information at all? Brilliant. Way to go.
---
Yeah none of those mutations affect it. They used to it show in the pip boy. The icon for it is a sad looking vault boy, mouth closed. It takes a loooooot of alcohol/drugs to get addicted, the chance is pretty low.if you take one only for emergencies you likely won’t get one often at all.
---
All other PA have plans you can buy to craft mods. 
---
thanks  ,    
---
today I'm going to take a loo k
---
I'm not giving up on anything, I LIKE the game and I really love playing it! I have a lot of fun with teams and even playing solo. The only thing I don't do is engage in PvP, just not me thing. For me, the game is so much fun that all these complaints don't bother me or ruin the game for me.
---
Yeah, Bethesda seems to be doing everything they can to get people to stop using TSEs. I'm half expecting them to just explode and insta-gib anyone who tries to use them next patch. 
---
Yeah makes sense
---
Ah, I gotcha.
---
&gt; Photos are stored on Beth servers
---
No they're not: I can go to the file location of all my photos because it's saved locally...
---
That's good, I'd hate for everyone who "purchased" these to have to suffer from the bug.
---
I can't speak for everyone who's now talking about this bug, but in my case, I've never had this happen before Patch 5.
---
The manta man outfit works as an outfit, but underarmors clip through it, atleast the enclave one does I havent tried others
---
Let me know if I missed other weapon complaints
---
I ok for RNG but why only X-01 should rely on RNG to get mods ? I m over 30hours of server hopping for my calibrated shocks. That’s just insane
---
I've had bulked items disappear twice in the last day when doing vendor runs - but both times the game crashed, so I assumed it had to be related.  Any chance you had a crash happen?
---
Great list, several of these I had on my bug list, but I had missed a few.   
---
I'm still waiting for them to add the missing Legendary Attach Points to the Drill and Syringer so all of those ones that drop on legendaries leveled lists will actually be worth something.
---
Why would I feel bad for them selling me hot garbage for $60?
---
Great idea! 
---
You wrote bug 7 before bug 6
---
It gets unequipped for some reason.  You have to regularly re-equip it.
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they're removing these items so they can sell them in the ATOM Store for real cash. Just look at the current power armor headlamp "bug".
---
There's an elevator that takes you to the top. I wanted to skydive off it but I had about a hundred pounds of junk on me and no power armor.
---
I thought one of the wings in the bunker had the plans for the mods?
---
Or was someone just flapping nonsense when they wrote that?
---
I can't figure out why the hell you need adhesive to make moltovs???
---
Yeah, I as well waited till a couple months after launch to purchase my reduced cost copy. Thank god I did or I would be as pissed as everyone else is around here. Definitely will wait a couple months after launch for future titles I plan on purchasing.
---
I was able to get on 76 early. Snow cancelation. I’m ready when you are. 
---
No, just no
---
CD Keys, way cheaper....
---
I've only seen a dead one in a cage at a Raider camp called The Freak Show or something.
---
Sorry, I recently started using punji boards around the extractors to take care of the mole rats and other small annoyances that come right next to them. That way folks can get supplies and not arrive to a broken extractor.
---
I’ll be on in 20 minutes
---
all glass bottles should work. what bullshit. 
---
why even bother having varieties of different empty bottles anyway 
---
Nobody cares about this long ass speech. Email it to Bethesda. 
---
Because, We The Enclave are the unwanted children of the wastes and are overlooked.
---
I’ve had the same kind of thoughts in regards to power plants. If you power them up, they provide power to workshops (Monongah Power Plant has a power box good for 100 electricity in the Munitions Factory for example). I think that if you complete an event to power up a plant AND own the workshop outside the plant, you should be able to charge a fee to anyone wanting to use your power. You could even set it up so that players could build power boxes in their camps and claim the workshop or pay a fee to activate it. 
---
Truly the Dark Souls of Fallout. 
---
I don't think he meant so much as cloud storage but rather the "checkpoints" on missions as well as properly logging out. The game is creating the saves. Not that it saves onto the server.
---
I play 10 hours a week max. I think it’s casual level
---
Imo only thing that matters is DMG, the game is unbalanced.  The enemies are unbalanced and only way to deal with balance issues is raw dps
---
As much as I would prefer to just buy them from a vendor, SBQ would still be much better than server hopping. At least then I could get them from actually playing the game instead of watching loading screens. 
---
I did skydive off it like 5 times and it was scary and i flought (is that a word?) like 5 seconds.
---
Its awesome! 
---
sorry
---
Finally. Thank you. 
---
Also price went down on the physical copy because it was released right before Black Friday and there was outrage
---
it deals 660 *i forgot if i was low hp or at max*
---
As far as i know it only sells the mods, randomly.
---
F
---
dont forget about the new broken cap stashes
---
It could be that you're just used to having pre-nerf TSEs backing you up. Even before the patch I had one or two SBQ fights with few or no TSEs and it made a very noticeable difference. Have you tried AA weapons? They're great against Scorch Beasts.
---
I don't think enemies' lack of energy resistance makes up for the just incredibly poor performance of energy weapons as a whole.  That (unbugged) 5 charge shot Salvaged Assaultron head blast pales in comparison to a regular single shot non-automatic rifle.  And ammo weight for energy weapons (or weapons in general, minus missiles or nukes) has never been a huge issue.  Comes with Batteries isn't going to make poor energy weapon suddenly better.
---
I don't see how additional slots for those who want them is any different than additional beds and paint jobs for those who want them.
---
If you like respeccing constantly that is fine, but it isn't an acceptable solution for me.
---
Damaged, but not destroyed, Camp items should be reset to full health upon loading into a world. It's a massive nuisance that the only way to repair damaged items is to store and re-place them. 
---
Especially if you're going to change the wanted system from adding wanted status to someone who damages them. The first thing people would start doing is damaging camp items to low health but not destroying them. 
---
During the beta (havent played the game for maybe a month and a half) i had a lockpicking skill of 6 when i only had 3 points.
---
greengaming , 
---
Moloshine. 
---
true it don't make any sense to exclude the x-01 alone out of all of them. guess good for the goose is good for the gander applies.
---
I play more but I've never even figured out Discord yet.  The primary mechanics around trading shouldn't be happening outside the game for people to find each other.
---
Superb analysis of gamers using FO76!
---
Don't worry, they'll eventually nerf melee because that's the strongest thing now, so everything will soon be as weak as pistols anyway! Have fun!
---
Why would they be embarrassed and ashamed that someone out 550+ hours into their game within 3 months?
---
Most games don't see that kinda playtime by players in their entire lifetime.
---
You obviously enjoyed the game if you played it that much.
---
One thing to keep in mind is when throwing multiple grenades is ensuring the arc is higher. The blast from the other one will detonate the second or third. I've killed myself a few times before I realized this. The other is mines, third one down activates them all :(  Trial by error i guess. Mostly now I don't carry mines and when tossing grenades I do one at a time or like you said being at a higher vantage point helps. 
---
No, I get the smiling, rosy-cheek one sticking his tongue out as if he's drunk.  I thought it just meant I was under the influence of something.
---
Lol how the hell does that indicate psycho? Maybe find a dictionary, moron. And Bethesda can ban you for whatever they fucking want, don’t kid yourself trying to think otherwise.
---
Nah he wrote it after **&amp;** before
---
I have purified water in the favorite wheel so no need to find.
---
I did forget the weight for explosive rounds as a reason to buff explosive weapons.
---
This is correct, don’t know why you get downvoted.
---
All valid points. Rather than basing it on just time or health, perhaps they could balance the two to determine probability of success or failure. 
---
I don’t think there’s a perfect solution to this problem, just ways to improve on what’s there. 
---
I purchased it directly from Bethesda.net. If you get a physical copy, I’m like...70% sure it just has a key and a downloader. And even if comes with a complete copy of some version of the game, you’d likely have many gigs worth of patch data to download.
---
"or brings back old ones." 
---
OR being the important bit.
---
Works with pipe revolver too btw
---
This is my go to fall back weapon.
---
I do use it on the bolt pistol but mostly as a sniper weapon
---
Any chance we can look to increase the Armor Penetration of the Gatling gun, .50 Cal, mini-gun and MG42? Right now a RNG gatling or 50 even if fully spec'd for the weapon does hardly any damage to the SBQ or standard SB, or other high level, heavy armor enemy. 
---
Everything but tricycles. That and the lack of pilot lights in the ovens are concerning.
---
Look into buying a used copy. Saw one on craigslist in my area for $10. Do not pay full price. There are deals out there. My digital copy was only $25 bought in mid December
---
Some of us have begun the task of trying to document and find the Heavy Combat armor.  So far it seems very random, and very rare, even though the patch notes say Vendor Plans are fixed and always available as soon as you are above the right level.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alygb7/plan_availability_on_vendors_working_as_intended/
---
What are you saying here? The AA affix doesn't work? Because it very clearly says it ignores 50% of armor.
---
Just travel along the sides of the savage divide there are tons of ridges overlooking the map there is a cool spot near the elevator looking over cortega
---
What plan? Please tell.
---
I thought the other thing that makes explosives hard to use though is the crafting cost of the mini nuke / missile / grenade. It's been a while since I checked but don't they require screws or springs or something? These are at the rarity level that's maybe appropriate for armor crafting / repair but it doesn't really make sense for ammo which you need to create a lot of. I remember taking one look at the material cost and thinking nope this is insane.
---
&gt; great expansions later in the year getting rave reviews 
---
Good joke. 10/10, would tell again.
---
Even with that perk the dps is pretty low. Also even with Ordinance Express the dps/weight is still very bad for these ammos.
---
All in all, they Explosive weapons are the worst choice in the game atm. The only decent option is AGL, but it breaks very fast and the Ammo is very hard to keep up.
---
Also if we could sell off or trade cards... Thru hikers nice but I don't need a 1, 2 and 3 lol
---
K. Bye. 
---
Please un-nerf Demo Expert or at least check out the damage of the explosive launcher weapons. I realize you guys wanted to make the perk fit with others and per-point it’s still a good deal, but some weapons like missile launchers are just not worth the durability they eat for the damage they output. Not to mention explosive ammo costs are phenomenally out of wack with what we get out of them now. I see you intend to address the auto grenade launcher not working with Bear Arms but did you know it also doesn’t work with Stabilized? Every perk that can affect a heavy weapon (other than Heavy Gunner perks) got broken for it, and the M79.
---
Also, heavy weapon durability in general is a problem. Not as bad as energy weapons but they’re still extremely fragile for their repair costs and use time.
---
Explain that Children of Atom
---
Scrap enough of a weapon and eventually you'll learn how to build one. The suppressed hunting rifle is a mainstay for me.
---
Absolutely agree, there has to be a way to scale after lvl 50
---
As a casual who started the game about a week ago, the game is very bland and empty, pretty much devoid, especially conpared to previous fallouts. Even as a casual, Im affected by the numerous bugs. When playing with my friend, one of us will "go invisible" and we wont be able to see each other to coop without restarting the game; too often the server will shutdown forcing us to find another server, which is frustrating and wastes time; it really sucks to encounter scorch beasts cause of their bugs: you cant hide jn a building to de aggro them and they just spam the sonic boom if youre outdoors, preventing any kind of escape; Ive lost loot cause the game spawned me in dead and wouldnt let me reapawn. Getting caps to do anything is a huge chore. I cant evem build a proper house cause the game wont let you save more than a handful of things in a blueprint. Theres just so much wrong with this AAA game its bonkers. The game feels like youre only killing things over again for the gameplay loop and when youre not killing, the game becomes Inventory Manager 2019 (you can only store a small amount which makes things worse...). Even as a casual who only plays in short bursts, the lack of effort into finishing this game and fixing bugs really shows, not only for me but for those who play with me. The future of fallout and elder scrolls games is in doubt for me.
---
Hey buddy ol pal.
---
And Todd in the corner rocking back and forth 
---
That is right. Guess you are super lucky!
---
No concrete evidence? It literally says „ignores 50% of opponents armor“, or did I not understand you right? (No native speaker)
---
Not that it would have helped in your case, but whenever I get the unresponsive workbench issue, I jump servers.  At the very least, it will save off your inventory.
---
The burden of proof is also on you. I gave you specific examples and reasoning yet you still continue to hold a subjective grudge. But let me add more information.
---
If you were caught cheating in H1Z1 you had to make a YouTube video apology for cheating. Tickets not being answered is also a constant problem in games like BDO or GW2, just this past week ArenaNet apologized for not answering tickets and improper bans. GTA 5 on PC didn't even run or work for almost a whole week. Diablo 3 and Error 37 locked out gamers for a few days. Ubisoft, Target, Blizzard, have also leaked cc information. The fact you say 76 dcs are the worst ever then say it's a fact shows how little experience or understanding you have. Any disconnect is a shitty disconnect. You get disconnected mid anything you are going to rage. WoW's plague bug was far worse than anything 76 has done. 
---
You continue to hold a subjective view of everything yet fail to look at the objective facts in front of you over an intense disdain and hatred for an intangible game. Either play it or don't, I don't care. But I will not stand here and listen to what is subjectively a false and incorrect narrative.
---
Melee generally doesn't need a rebalance, Ranged does.   
---
It should not take a level 200 6 shots with a .44 to kill a Molerat or a standard non-glowing Ghoul..   
---
Ranged, once leveled and "Perked up" should be able to One shot (head shots) "Trash Mobs" with High damage rifles, and kill those same targets in a few shots, not 15, with mid range weapons.   
---
One of the reasons duping was so rampant.  The RNG in this game is non existent.  Fanboys on this sub will LIE about it and come up with excuses but your 100% right.  There is nothing to EARN in this game, literally nothing to play for.  Just terrible RNG, that after the new patch, players can see how really bad it is because vendors now have plans you have never seen before.  
---
**Pip Boy Glitch** - bringing up your Pip-Boy immediately after loading into a server can cause you to get stuck in place, sometimes permanently, forcing a relog.
---
**Hunger and Thirst Drain** - hunger and thirst meters appear to be draining much quicker than normal as of Patch 5.
---
**"Damage Bug"** - Damage bug appears to be back, albeit far less common. Got stuck unable to deal ranged damage and had to use melee.
---
**Rad Worms** - Rad Worms is bugged and causes ALL player effects to be increased by 50%, not just radiation damage. When Rad Worms is cleared this can neuter some player effects such as the Marsupial mutation.
---
In fact the Rad Worms "perk" itself has two effect entries in the ESM, one is the correct effect that increases rads and the other is the glitched one that increases all player effects, so as a result Rad Worms is actually increasing rad damage twice! This should be an easy fix, just remove the errant effect entry.
---
**Double Loading Screens** - still present despite recent fixes. More of an annoyance than anything.
---
**Fake/Disappearing Loot** - occasionally when going to loot an enemy, some of the loot in the container will disappear and/or change to something else.
---
**Scorchbeast Queen flies off the map** - the SBQ will occasionally fly out of bounds and stay there for the duration of Scorched Earth, preventing players from completing the mission.
---
**Scorchbeast Queen's corpse disappears and cannot be looted** - under extreme server lag the SBQ's corpse will occasionally disappear entirely, not even leaving a meat pile, preventing players from looting her corpse.
---
**CAMP could not be placed, except it can** - On several occasions I've received the message that my CAMP could not be placed, yet I'm able to walk right up to where I had it and place the CAMP anyway.
---
**Harvesting plants is missing the sound cue** - since Patch 5, I no longer get an audio cue when I harvest my plants from my CAMP.
---
**Empath and Herd Mentality mutations unaffected by Class Freak** - issue has been present since launch.
---
**Quest "Recruitment Blues" triggering incorrectly** - sometimes walking up to Camp McClintock will trigger Recruitment Blues to start - even if it's already been completed!
---
**Zealot's and Scorched Killer prefixed weapons don't receive bonuses on the Scorchbeast Queen** - they do get bonuses on normal scorchbeasts however.
---
**Radiation Suits and the Grognak's Axe cannot be repaired past 100%** -- using the appropriate perks when repairing these items will only repair them to 100%.
---
**Legendary enemies attempting to drop legendary Drills and Syringers** - Drills and Syringers cannot spawn with legendary effects, yet Legendary enemies will attempt to drop them anyway, leaving a normal Drill or Syringer.
---
**Where is my Chainsaw?** - to my knowledge there is only one chainsaw in the entire game and it spawns at level 30. Additionally, no plans exist to craft one. I don't know if this was intentional or not but it seems like an oversight to me, can we get more spawns for this?
---
**Radium Rifle mod learn chance bugged** - Often you have to scrap dozens of these just to learn a single mod. Please investigate.
---
**Protective and Shielded Lining mods for Casual Underarmor are impossible to get** - There is no legitimate drop for the Protective Lining Casual Underarmor Mod anywhere in the game. As such, you cannot get this OR the shielded lining - "Daily: Queen of the Hunt" can award the Shielded lining but will not do so unless you already know the Protective lining, which is impossible because you can't get it legitimately.
---
Please look into these issues, a lot of them have been present since launch! And thanks for continuing to support the game.
---
Was it pretty much double damage before patch? That's a harsh drop. I've got an Instigating Fat Man, do you know if explosive weapons correctly use the Instigating modifier or not?
---
I haven't even started the bos on one of my characters and I saw the plan with phoenix
---
I'm not being belligerent, just thought people should know, this hasn't happened to me as a stealth character on xbox one. I don't have any Chameleon gear or perks.. maybe the problem is there?
---
I'm well aware that you can access your photos locally. But are you sure they're not also stored server side along with the characters? Only reason I make the assumption that they are is I did delete my save data, and it did not affect my pics at all. Only the game settings. 
---
It's upcoming content. That really shouldn't be there.
---
x Nubbz

Xbox 1S
---
I'm going to try my best to explain! I'm trying to scrap all my junk in my inventory (I know it leaves behind certain items and won't scrap literally everything) and it won't let me click scrap all as if there was nothing in my junk inventory. So I looked in the bench and sure enough I had nothing but when I check my pipboy I have all my junk still
---
Not quite right. My reasoning is that it's not the end of the world and it will be fixed in due time.
---
I really like this idea! It lets you choose whether or not you want your C.A.M.P. visible or not and adds a nice lore-friendly item that you can place!
---
I've had this for a while too.  It's like if you ever used Chameleon armor in a session, you continue to have it even if you un-equip it.
---
This is mostly small stuff, but it's a pile of probably similar things, especially the daily quests:
---
Triggering daily missions is random and sporadic. I have never gotten more than one of the Camden Park daily missions without changing servers, and I have to hang around the southern part of the ash heap to trigger it.  Supposedly you can get the whole 'mistaken identity' quest to trigger again but if so I don't know how or where.
---
I can go get Amy's password, head to the trailer and login to the terminal, and not trigger the Environmental monitor quest. As an aside, when the quest seems to randomly trigger, you have to find Amy's corpse again to get the password every time, and that's not flagged in the repeated mission.
---
I've never successfully purposefully triggered any daily in toxic valley while anywhere near toxic valley except replacing the gun range targets, which can often pop up when in Grafton.
---
Queen of the Hunt has only triggered once since the first time I got it several weeks ago, I think I was down in Cranberry bog when it popped. Accessing her terminal does nothing. 
---
The pumpkin collection/bomb quest I find can be fairly often triggered if I run to that location from 2-3 fast travel spots away. Fast travelling to him doesn't let me ever start the quest.
---
The tea-honey quest seems to only reset about 50% of the time and only after the tea time event. Though it's probably one of the more reliable daily's you can trigger.
---
There's no way to turn in technical documents I already had prior to getting the collect technical documents quest in the first place as far as I can tell.
---
Event: Swarm of Suitors seems broken or pointless; success gives like, 10 or 20 caps and 50 or something XP? Failure lets the queen spawn, for better rewards. Also scaling appears to be off; I was in the area when it started last night with my 103 level character and all the crabs were at their highest in the teens. My level 19 alt got chased out a few nights ago when it started with level 40 mirelurks (with no-one else around)
---
Was it really necessary to make the emergency supply drops locked, single loot, and owned? I was slowly using up my tapes just dropping stuff in the lower areas like the forest and such, I don't even check the loot myself, it's not worth the running time to get them, but for lowbies it's nice. Now it's a bounty troll causing them to get griefed.
---
Nagging annoyance, Toxic Valley Treasure Map 03 can't be anywhere but that crashed sailboat at the Pioneer camp. It's one of the more obvious maps in the set. And it doesn't work at what obviously is a dig mound. I looked up a list of maps online and went to every single map site listed and TV TM 03 opens (lets you dig at) none of them.
---
Guess we are 2/3 beta testing now. 
---
This was happening to me regularly at least before Christmas.
---
I love how many of these I’m starting to see lol
---
My server crashed and now it’s not there anymore so yeah
---
West Virginia runs on COAL, BY GOD!!!!!
---
No, I used to, but since a friend started dealing in mutations, I did a scrub down &amp; Re-Mute, to maximize positives, &amp; minimize the negatives, Only running 9 mutations now.
---
So there is Steve, and sometimes Erica from accounting comes down and helps out, and a guy named David comes and refills the vending machine in the basement where they work. So, three.
---
What about the stealth issues that have been reported, and bulk junk now getting scrapped when you scrap all junk post the patch 5 hotfix?
---
Certain areas hold certain enemies levels. You could try staying in either the Toxic Valley or Ash heap. The Savage Divide, The Mire, and The Cranberry Bog don't have a ceiling like the other two mentioned areas.
---
&gt;...the recent find of lunchboxes in the games files...
---
Wasn't that back before Christmas? And nothing's come of it since?
---
I believe the general consensus as well as what's been teased by BGS, that yes; they will be raid content.
---
If you go further south to Johnson's Acre, there's a small hill on the cliff with catapults [that fling skeletons over the edge of the map](/spoiler).

After the Vendor Plan patch a couple days ago or before?

I know the server isn't streaming audio moron, way to put words in my mouth. Also, your new name is "servers run **months and years** without restarts" guy. Anything you've said since then has just been you trying to sound like you're not an idiot. I'm not fooled.

Also, I posted last night to see if I'm the only one on console without real issues.. [turns out I'm not](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alytgk/honest_question_is_ps4_the_best_experience_or/).

So you keep on crying like a little baby while the rest of us have virtually no issues, Mr computer expert 😂😂😂

I hwvwnt been on in a while so it was before the patch

You're right. I could have sworn the WW2 documentary I watched said the Russians invented them. I knew they were named after the minister of foreign affairs in jest.

Fusion cores as ammo or grenades is a great idea. I've just dumped far too many to count, and it seems like such a waste every time

Any chance for a damage increase with Ultracite Gating laser?  I read that it was an 'end game weapon,' but the damage it does seems... a bit lite. I'm not asking to one- shot kill everything.  But an end game weapon that requires 5-10 shots with charging barrels seems... bit much? Also it breaks very fast and drains fusion cores fast, even with all three levels of the power user perks. 
---
Any chance you could make the drainage for the Gatling laser similar to how it was in Fallout 4? 
---
I think that I am going to swap the prime receiver in and out depending on whether I'm going to fight the SBQ or anything else

Automatic weapons cause frame rate issues on console

This post better be a joke...

Why would that be a reason to play more? i dont get it ...
---
Apologies I don’t know how I’ve missed that, I spent hours looking up AA online and didn’t see that somehow (that and I have an AA combat shotgun in game).  
---
  Curse me for missing that and hoping the Somerset special would be something “special”
---
The fact that this request was phrased the same as the slogan of a certain current political laughingstock disturbs me greatly.

Press F to pay respects
---
I thought they weigh 0.001lb. I could be wrong, Idk.
---
Peace ✌️ 
---
My assumption could be wrong. But I've been under the understanding that everything except game settings we're stored server side by Bethesda. And yes (as someone already pointed out), I am aware that the photos are stored locally. Seeing as how all of my data was still present after deleting everything in the FO76 game saved data section, I assume it's stored server side as well. Been wrong before though. 
---
I would honestly like to see them add Legendary Throwing Weapons. They would always have to spawn with a Returning affix, but everything after that could be a lot of fun. 
---
Exploding throwing knives, please. 
---
In all honesty, I dont think I have one. I like the idea of alot of the people and what they stood for, but I dont think they went about things the right way. I personally like the overseers view. That if all felactions disregarded what separated them, they could have stood against the scorched
---
No one would ever waste a nuke there. You're safe
---
How about a useful all purpose crossbow, talk about under used weapons?
---
Thats bad tho
---
Thank you, I have a hunting rifle at the minute (can't remember the prefixes) but I shall keep scrapping to look for the suppressed version!
---
:) you know I have the internet in my house...there’s something called YouTube on there......so I know what Fo76 looks and runs like on even Ultra settings. Good jokes though. Destiny/peasant and all that. Next you should tell me I’m a Sony Pony

They aren't weightless.  The weight display doesn't contain enough digits to show it.

No, he's on top of the mountain overlooking Harper's ferry.  If you fast travel to Harper's Ferry, turn around and you'll see a mountain on the other side of the river that the train tracks go into.  He's at the top of that.  
---
He's guarding the corpses of his masters.
---
G'day...what do you got :-)
---
The Demolitions Expert nerf failed to take into consideration that players focusing on throwables will not only have invested 5 perk slots into DE, but 2 or more perception perk slots (Grenader and Fire in the Hole) and up to 3 strength perk slots into Ordinance Express. Against the above I suggest that DE has not been over performing and that the nerf be un-nerfed.
---
 If TSE weapons need a further nerf then those effects should be disallowed on the same weapon.
---
I’d love to see more events like this! I didn’t even realize how cool it was until after it was gone.
---
No mention of explosive damage and how shitty the explosive damage is ? 
---
I would argue pistols are in a much worse position.
---
But ya, I pretty much have to run around using my All Rise until I have a decent amount of springs and aluminum to make missiles and 40mm grenades. I then burn through them pretty quick and have to go back to melee.
---
Spent all my caps on bulk springs and aluminum AFTER clearing my daily allocation of clipboards from Sugar Grove, McClintock, and pretty much any other office building I could think of. With ammosmith and super duper, I still only ended up with about 300 40mm ammo, which I can run through in less than an hour.
---
hello fellow ghost! how long does it last?
---
Yes, it’d really help a lot if they add this in! Also, it’d be great if they can make it so that you can’t sell your favourited items too! I’ve almost sold my favourited weapons to the vendors a few times and that was scary lol
---
Well, you'll always have the screenshot. 
---
And if that's the case, it's all the more reason that people need access to the armor plans. If we can't craft it, it's going to be so much harder to grind out those mods.
---
I don't think these items are completely exclusive to the dev room. I think they're just super rare.
---
🙄
---
see I found a set of the pants on watoga station which is why I became curious to where the others were as I planned to make BOS variant and hand it out to lvl 20s 
---
Amen!
---
forgot to answer your useless comment 
---
Honestly the queen just shouldn't scale to the number of people that show up. You should be thankful when more people come to help, not resent them for not doing their "fair share" of damage now that she's been scaled up to accommodate them. 
---
If it was it was done accidentally I assure you, I have no idea who your on about but I have a rough idea, their can't be that many laughingstocks in politics 
---
A lot of mining operations are owned by out of country monopolies. A lot of our coal mines were owned by German and Russian corporations dating back. Natural gas is still the way right now, but coal mining not as much. Even our water utilities were German owned for awhile. There is a business of coal mining engineers who literally work with Chinese companies to get coal mines up and running. 
---
There's the majority of the weird corporate bullshit you find in the game is very inspired by events that really happened. The excavator armor and motherhlode were literally a sci fi take on the John Henry fable. Even little shit like finding a house in monogah that a giant boulder smashed into is something that happens when mining regs are not enforced or too relaxed. 
---
I would go as far to say most of the pre war stories that aren't enclave and brotherhood centric are inspired by wv history.
---
You can add a switch to the back to allow yourself to open it.

[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup - Jan 2019 Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj11j2/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_jan_2019/)  
---
I had to break up the post because there are more thn 60,000 characters of bug's and suggested fixes, and there are tons not yet included.
---
I wanted a spiked walking cane plan but I could only find barbed. I must have spent a couple weeks trying to get it because [the wiki](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Spiked_Walking_Cane) said it dropped from the forest events/dailies.
---
I did eventually find the spiked mod a few nights ago at the Whitespring station vendor. Not the plan though, so I'd need another if I ever find a better cane.
---
This game clearly needs a Thompson Contender so we can get some nifty multi ammo boom sticks.
---
SO INCOMPETENT! How does a company just CONSTANTLY step in its dick this much? 
---
It doesn’t seem like they care about anything to do with weapons and there damage. 
---
Possibly to the end of the session.  I'm really not sure.  I also don't know if it is a functional Chameleon, or if it's just the aesthetic effect that gets stuck.
---
Here is a video displaying the issue at hand

Its a bug there using the red lamp for a model in the shop and they messed up the item names so you cant use red headlamps till a new pacth is out

Holotape "Incident Record 5374" in Watoga Emergency Services.  Oh, the dangers of automation ... :/

&gt;!Girl calls Emergency Services robots to report that her cat is stuck in a tree.  Bot uses stone-cold logic:  cat is in tree; cat shouldn't be in tree.  Shoot cat down; cat no longer in tree.!&lt;
---
And Black powder pistol is where?
---
Fuck your commie explosives! This ain’t the USSR! Use a baseball grenade like a proud ‘merican!
---
My guess is that you (and I) have very good internet connections and that many of the issues people are experiencing are due to the game client or server not handling latency well / correctly. The developers in their work environment obviously have awesome internet connections as well so they won't run into these bugs unless they setup some artificial latency testing environment.
---
If it was half AP for pistols could see it being a solid tradeoff 
---
Watch "Blood on the mountain" on Netflix. Also watch "the devil we know" on Netflix. Both with give you an in depth look at companies and secrets in our great state. 
---
The story out at "Johnson's Acre" was pretty good, I forget if it was a note or a holotape, but he talks about how he could see the war go down, but he was so far out, it didn't affect him, but now he has nowhere to go and no resources, and he decides he has to leave to make it.
---
it's also got the cool catapults, so it's worth going to.
---
Thank you seems my outfit is the only one with this bug, guess I made a poor choice, lol.
---
I think it would be great to display any toys, helmets, and masks you find out in the wasteland.   
---
In addition, I think it would be cool to make trophies. Say you kill a Deathclaw and it drops the Deathclaw head, you can later mount that in your camp.
---
Yup.  I had to just close Reddit out, couldn't see any of my other subreddits feed for all the fo76 patch rage
---
hmm ill server hop and see if that works
---
Please rethink your nerf of two shot rifles et al. It’s not a rebalancing act, it’s an ill conceived mistake, like most of the game since launch.
---
Ps4? What are they perks on it?
---
You gave the game more of a chance than it ever deserved. 
---
lol bethesda games to the rescue. fixing problems with more problems 1 problem at a time.
---
Sometimes you are constantly in caution now. Sometimes relogging fixes it. But Bethesda roll back whatever you did to sneak.
---
I never understood why they didn't give you plans to modify named guns like this. Why give me a world unique item I am just going to out level? My shotgun build would love to keep his Civil Unrest. A idea I was trying to work would mean named/legendary weapons would level with you, maybe you'd have to dump scrap into it? This would just be another thing to farm/compete with materials.
---
Get a prime receiver instead, it deals more dmg to everything AND even more to any scorched including scorchbeasts, but the ammo is harder to make.
---
i wish that "cripping" the center arms would drop the crate even if the cargobot isn't destroyed.
---
I say nerf melee. But we add some small base dmg boost per level after lvl 50? maybe 0.1, so 10 levels will give you an additional 1 point base dmg.
---
The thing about bugs is that they don't affect most people (usually). Same deal with defective hardware - it's not like 100% of Xbox 360s or IBM DeskStars died, but enough did that it was talked about a lot.
---
In FO76 there are enough problems and they are affecting enough people that it gets talked about. The fact that some players are blissfully ignorant and enjoying a mostly OK experience doesn't get Bethesda off the hook for releasing the game in this state.
---
But I have to ask did you really get through the game without being unable to complete Bureau of Tourism at some point because the ticket dispenser was intangible? Did you luck out and find Evan alive and ready to be killed?
---
people were talking about this just a while ago, apparently it’s because now the red headlamp is supposed to be like “an exclusive item” for the upcoming atom shop mothman paint job 
---
I got myself a  Executioners fat man for the late fight, which is great because that is when you get swarmed by mobs
---
Meh. 
---
That would add another 35-140 damage to each bullet you fired. I will pass on that horrible idea.
---
Make a new character and find a new way to play the game.
---
There will be a 200 caps a day limit on this, I guarantee it.
---
what we need to get is the plans for the somerset weapon as well as any legendary item we find so we can build them its not like a handful of 1 star items really will cause significant issues and would give crafters a reason to exists since as of right now high lvl crafters get nothing but mods 
---
If you made bug report, you won't get an answer.
---
So if weight isn't a problem pistols are worthless?
---
Yes!
---
It’s just weird that I can place a gate successfully but then not be able to attach the fence to it. It’s almost like the gate has a different set of perimeters than the fence, which honestly possible. It’s almost as frustrating and finicky as the stairs with the platform. 
---
Also, I’m glad to see someone else using “finagling” 😂. I just had to explain to my son what that meant. I use that word a lot in relation to fo76. Lol
---
I believe the base combat plans that allow you to make the actual armor are still available to buy from vendors, its just mods like the BoS mod, that can only be earned through scrapping where as before you could buy the plan or learn it via scrapping.
---
&gt; Have you taken a SBQ down since the update?
---
Yes, multiple times. Where it took 30 seconds before the update it takes about one minute now. You can't put that on bobble head stacking.
---
Wait, all the rifle *and* pistol perks work if it's a pipe rifle? The faster run while carrying, weight reduction, damage, etc? All of it?
---
You forgot to tell us how many hours you have played 
---
Have you played multiplayer game before (or work on IT project)? Discord is convenient tool for communication.
---
I thought about hub. I thought about cross-server stock market. I thought about vending machines. But these thing will not be implemented soon. And several discord servers for fo76 trade are exist now and works fine. I usually buy ammo there and sell mats.
---

Nope think I'll pass thanks ;) lol
---
Anybody else get the glitch when you kill a mass of enemies within a set time scale, like 10 seconds. Most/all spawn legendary items in, but are really crappy 1* ones? Killed a couple of 3* charred, with a mass of standards and instead of 2 3* legos, i get like 6 1* legos. I would prefer the quality over the quantity!
---
Instigating + vats crit dmg Black powder pistol kills nearly every enemy that walks on ground in one hit only with one pistol dmg perk and totally sneaky movement
---
P.S. I havn't tried a Zealots ML. How many missiles does it take to kill one SB?
---
Yep. That is all.
---
I'm not seeing the resistant, treated, shielded linings show up at all anymore. I would think that the raider lining (based on what i had previously learned) would show up at the raider vendor but I haven't seen them.
---
yeah it is boring.  but i like that.
---
I want more/better stair options that don't break you base. And something like pressure plates. 
---
They are separate in the challenge, the Alien is the same as the ones in previous Fallout games. Your either very new to Fallout or a troll.
---
PC here and while I've had some bugs and disconnects nothing that makes me rage - my friend on the other hand has had a ton and we fixed his pc (don't have a clue how but were not questioning the magic) 
---
that said I do want to keep focused on bugs so all can play and enjoy but at same time I feel the threats and rage needs to come down and bethesda needs to work on explaining things AHEAD of patches and doing some quality of life and balance (not nerf) fixes to the game
---
The Bohemeth is disappearing after ragdolling, and respawning at his location frozen. You then get no loot or XP 70% of the time. This started after the update.  We have seen it over 10 times on various servers.
---
This would be a great idea to help bridge the transparency and communication gap between Bethesda Staff and the community.
---
It's a great idea because even any sort of insight would be a breath of fresh air which we need. So naturally, of course that won't happen. Please check out this cool teddy bear outfit you can buy for ~~3600~~ 2800 Atoms on sale!
---
i can get x+100 to damage on level y+100. I can be better then low levels with the same guns and it makes sense
---
What platform is this on? I played on my stealth character after hearing this, and stealth is completely normal (functional, nothing unexpected) for me on PC. I wonder if there is some other interaction that is affecting some people but not others.
---
You're actually safe from most nukes unless someone randomly places one. There's only a some places considered "worth it". Whitesprings, Fissure Prime, West-Tek, Monograh Town, Harper's Ferry, Morgantown, Charleston, and Watoga.
---
The three most popular are Whitesprings, Prime, and National Array/West Tek. West Tek is a relatively recent find.
---
Just make sure they're not around these areas and you will be fine
---
Sorry, I was reloading mine first.
---
!!ding ding ding ding ding!!
---
I think the relevant perk (can make simple/advanced mods, or something like that) needs to be enabled in you SPECIAL stats.
---
I had bought a sacrificial blade mod for a machete and tried to install it, but it wouldn’t either. Had to increase the makeshift card to get it installed.
---
Experiencing the same issue. Hard to pinpoint what’s happening because the weights are ALL OVER the fucking place. At 310 capacity with deep pocketed leather everything, I was carrying about 260lbs and it was still showing as over-encumbered. Seems that I needed to be about 100lbs under weight to stop the warning. 
---
Server hopping seems to at least temporarily fix the problem. Tends to get out of whack when I’m switching from power armor to normal or when shifting junk from my person to the stash. 
---
Suuuuper frustrating. 
---
Pistols are useful in other scenarios, like looting for max potential. Not necessarily if there's a weight capacity issue.
---
Melee *isn't* OP because of it's range. This and the hunting Rifle are different viewpoints.
---
That's great and all - but the ATOM SHOP item is something i spent actual 'money' on.
---
Lol true but I’ve found more than two there. Kinda have to really look since there’s so much junk everywhere in that facility. If anything stock up on the straight jackets and buy them from the vendor
---
So you contend that FO76 is good for the brand?  The massive wave of negative press?  The heavy discounts?  The desperate attempts to give away copies?  These things will promote the FO brand in a positive way?
---
I hope we get mounted critters like in FO4 as well.
---
honestly this is best get caps quick method ive done to date. just mass craft, mass sell. no pissing around looting crap for hours, easy
---
What’s your build?
---
Tank melee / stealth rifleman?
---
You’ve got cover from atleast 2 points, use ranged weapons or, wait till it drops and swing that hammer
---
We shouldn't have fast travel at all. 
---
Drivers are updated to the version where Fallout 76 was officially supported. With your settings I have even lower values than 44 FPS. Are you still using the same settings as above? Thanks for your help!
---
can't understand why they don't put a lock feature in place to prevent this from happening.
---
Bulk items that are scrapped in the character’s inventory after using the “Scrap All” option is currently working correctly based on the original design of the scrapping system. Changing the system so that it prevents an item from being autoscrapped in players’ inventories, but still allows autoscrapping from the stash, would be new functionality that we’d implement specifically for this purpose.   
---
We felt it was important to quickly address bulk items needing to be manually scrapped in our hotfix on Thursday, but making further adjustments to prevent Scrap All from autoscrapping bulk in the inventory will take additional time. We’re also currently discussing an idea that would allow players to mark specific items to stop them from being autoscrapped. We’ll let you know as soon as we have something in place to address this. In the meantime, you can place bulk items in your stash to prevent Scrap All from breaking them up.
---
So why would anyone ever have to pay for anything if they could just use the service/product, then months after purchase make a phone call and get back all their money with no questions asked (as long as they say ‘it wasn’t fit for purpose’?)
---
Weak compared to what? Melee? With melee you're sacrificing range for raw power. With that lack of range, you need the health to absorb those hits.
---
i uninstalled fo76 lol
---
Why? At level 82, I can one-hit headshot almost everything that isn't a cryptid/scorchbeast with my non-two shot/explosive lever action rifle.
---
How much more damage do you need to be doing?
---
I hear that, and can appreciate it, but the evidence is overwhelming that this was a poorly thought out enterprise, and was more of a money grab from Bethesda than a game, capitalizing on the brand loyalty of the fallout base. I understand that we’re all just trying to make it through the day, but customers were taken advantage of. They have a right to be upset. Companies literally employ CM’s to put a positive spin on situations and mollify customers bases, further enabling these companies’ behavior. I don’t have access to a dev or Hines or Howard, or I’d tell them the same thing. 
---
Well tell that to Red Dead 2 :P
---
&gt; To (sic) much free time my friend?
---
Yes, actually :)
---
If you feel levels are horrible horrible pain then why care at all if they change things, you already clearly hate the game... or your just being dramatic...
---
Weird PS4 seems to be working fine
---
I agree, in fo4 pistols had a niche as the best guns for critical hits in the game.  Critical hits got heavily nerfed in fo76, and by proxy so did pistols.  
---
My suggestions:
---
* Make fo76 versions of "critical banker" but make it exclusive to pistols.
---
* Change grim reaper's sprint so that rank 3 works like it did in fo4 but only for pistols ex: " Any kill in V.A.T.S. has a 35% chance to restore all Action Points.  When using pistols, kills in V.A.T.S. that restore all action points also refill your Critical meter."
---
* Tweak critical savvy so that it works better for pistols.  
---
   * ATM critical savvy reduces crit meter consumption by 15%, 30%, and 45% for rank 1, 2, and 3. 
---
   * So change it to 25%, 50%, and 75% for pistols meaning at rank 3 critical hits will only consume 25% of the critical bar.  Or if that's op whatever % makes sense so long as pistols wind up with the capacity to spam crits more than other weapons.
---
Make it a berserker build and you'll still be able to wreck shit if you can get to it.
---
Fair
---
I could get behind that, though the bitching if implemented would be even worse than TSE
---
You forgot, “If I had my freakin duped explosive TSE..”
---
Answering you would be a spoiler, but [no it's not a plot spoiler.](/spoiler)
---
Probably with intention to make us grind even more since theres no endgame
---
The difference is that Bethesda hasn't given up on trying to charge $60 for the game. They don't have any physical stock to worry about while second party retailers (gamestop ,etc) have to justify shelf space. Additionally, most stores probably overestimated demand for fo76 based on a game that didn't shoot for rock bottom post launch. Thus gamestop and other stores selling physical copies are selling off their surplus for less to clear shelf space for other games that will have more demand.
---
I forget what I paid back then, but I think it was around 800ish caps?  Maybe between that and 1200?
---
To add value to character progression 
---
Fun fact: you can actually douse a fire with 100 proof vodka (only 50% abv) 
---
I’m not quite sure where it starts becoming flamable, maybe around 120 proof?
---
The internet will tell you 76-80 proof is flammable, but my own personal extensive testing says otherwise
---
I am definitely interested in Farcry. I was somewhat disappointed with FC5 but I still enjoyed the gameplay and storyline. I was just disappointed in the co-op and territory control mechanic. Exodus will probably be good. I recently picked up the Redux and enjoyed 2033 but I haven’t played the sequel yet. 
---
Awesome set-up. You make it look easy.
---
I don't understand so many thing in this regard
---
I think largetexturearraymipskip=1 instead of 0, I am using now. Try this please 
---
I'm just saying anyone who actually shoots knows it's surprisingly difficult to shoot a handgun accurately
---
VATS and crits? With Concentrated Fire on the head? Sneak DMG? Sneak Perk level?
---
Right, popularity equals quality, gotcha.  Kind of like how popular AOL got, or how popular iOS is, etc. It's not cause they are dumbed down for dumbasses or anything, you know, telling people exactly what to do and where to go. Nope, couldn't be that. 
---
I am, that could be why 
---
I was stuck with constant caution but mobs inside the building (which requires a loading screen to get into) were not aware of my presence.
---
I killed the turrets outside the building and it removed the caution status inside the building.
---
Oh ok. I've used them too but they end up getting destroyed by mobs.
---
As someone with a 2 yr old, I agree completely
---
No crash but had a few enimies frozen into place and unable to loot them after killing them, sorry to hear about your items though, seriously how can items just disappear 
---
Did you scrap before selling? Cause scrapping scraps all bulk junk now
---
Could we add some small base dmg boost per level? maybe 0.1, so 10 levels will give you an additional 1 point base dmg. Also some small base armor, hp scaling, to five some character progression past level 50. 
---
How about free (or reduced fare) if you've been to that area before? So level 2s don't jump where they don't really belong?
---
Blood on the Mountain covers the mining industry and the struggles and protests over the years. 
---
The Devil we know covers the chemical industry that has poisoned so many things, its terrifying. 
---
For real I could use that teddy bear outfit. Have just enough atoms, hope they listen to your idea
---
But why should you have to add a switch to something where theres already a switch that you just can't use? Also, if you flip that switch you have cant close it from the outside because the door stays on because there's power. It's just illogical. 
---
bruh im pretty much done i think..tuesday night..played 1.5 hours..wednesday night..logged in..felt no desire to really play..logged out after 5 mins..last night..did not play at all..a shame too..this was one of my favorites..and i invested countless hours into the game
---
I don't know if this is feature or a bug, so I'll just list it and you guys can help. So, someone nuked whitesprings today, so I jumped over. So 4 of us are marching along, and a bunch of ghouls runs out. We all shoot them, they all die. So we go to loot them, and before my eyes things start disappearing from the list of loot. It appears all of us were sharing the same loot as a "whoever gets there first" kind of thing. Is that right? I thought it was supposed to spawn separate loot for everyone. 
---
I need maps and paper for tables. I have a war room with a blank table :/
---
Eagerly picking up every gun so I could break it down. I was so excited when I found my first Combat Shotgun, because that meant I could start getting all the attachments for it and eventually make my own!
---
You scrapped then all back into un bulked items
---
I did the same earlier. You need to be careful
---
Yes, just yes.
---
Me too, but it's too late. It was a "from release or never" thing. 
---
I don't think suspension of that disbelief is beyond what is acceptable in the fallout world though. VATS could easily bridge that gap.
---
Its broken atm i think
---
I agree that there are many aspects to weapon balance but I’d still argue these weapons are very weak across the board. Totally agree with the melee arguments though.
---
An additional example of what you brought up is that the energy defenses of a lot of players are significantly lower than their standard damage resist, especially those who aren’t using PA. This means energy damage isn’t reduced as much as ballistic damage in PvP. But sadly, this still equates to less overall damage in most cases due to the significant base damage difference.
---
And I agree that between Weapon Artisan and Gunsmith 5 you can overcome a lot of the weapon fragility issues. Further I want to praise you for bringing up durability stock options. Ultimately a lot of challenges can be overcome by investing sting the problem and applying the right load-out. It’s one of the things I love about this game. 
---
However, I do think that energy weapons, even using many metrics, still reliably underperform compared to their ballistic counterparts. To be totally fair, there’s a wide range of ballistic imbalances too (comparing the 50 cal to the lmg or Gatling gun to mini gun shows glaring differences too) so it’s important that we note that.
---
I think the main issue is that base damage IS the number one metric if you’re not dedicated to a energy weapons character concept.
---
You’re not going to want use a laser rifle that does 1/5th the damage of an equal level combat rifle with the same perk load-out. The same is the case for the Gatling Laser/Plasma versus the Gatling Gun. DPS is more difficult to measure in FO76 than games that actually show damage numbers, but the difference is big enough to see in practice. If laser weapons were super fragile but did *more* damage before they broke that would feel balanced. If they were highly effective in PvP without armor-piercing perks or had a chance to apply unique, useful effects like defense lowering, blinding, etc, they might feel balanced. But how it is now is that they do damage similar to a ballistic weapon 20 levels lower, don’t do anything unique and break faster too.
---
How cool would it be if The Cryolater actually slowed mobs (and players!) usefully? That could be a meta counter to a melee PvP rush. What if plasma reduced armor for a limited time as it ate through the scorched beast’s hide? Or if a critical laser shot to the head add a % miss chance to your victim?
---
If there isn’t anything unique about energy weapons then they’re just weak options given the damage. People can work around durability, weight, and ammo costs, but they can’t work around a such low base damage. 
---
Nope. It’s real.
---
its fixed now had to close out the game but its fixed
---
Scrapping all junk in your inventory will scrap all bulked items as well.  Gotta keep them in your Stash or make sure to not "Scrap All" if you are trying to go to a Stash-less vendor to sell them.
---
Thank you. This was the saddest story I had the chance to read in my whole life. 
---
It's getting really hard to tell sometimes...
---
There was a guy early demanding bethesda let us exchange out atoms and caps for money because "we deserve it"
---
Favorite feature could work well for this potentially.
---
Umm, neither lol. The Flatwoods Monster is a purple friggin alien or I guess Zetan if you will. Outside of the alien blaster weapon, the Flatwoods Monster, and a random green alien in the bed of a dump truck Easter egg. I've not seen nor heard of anything else "alien-wise" in 76. Not saying I've seen it all by any means, because I most certainly have not. 
---
it can also be some small value for xp and armor. So lvl 250 does have something to gain character-wise when he hits lvl 251. 
---
All I know is 1 + 1 = 11. 
---
Explosive shouldn't be just a legendary type, it should be a receiver like the prime receiver, that you make a special "explosive ammo" for.  The mechanics are already in the game it should just be expanded.
---
That way it self-limits to however much ammo you can create.
---
As a wise man once said:
---
l think all bullets should cost $5,000 dollars! Five thousand dollars for a bullet. You know why? ‘Cause if a bullet costs $5,000, there’d be no more innocent bystanders. That’d be it. Every time someone gets shot, people will be like, ”Damn, he must have did somethin’… Shit, they put $5o,000 worth of bullets in his ass!’
---
Thought it was just me. I've got the Speed Demon, but even now it's crazy fast.
---
I'm from the Boston area and FO4 was actually quite disappointing on your third point
---
Thought that was beacuse they tried to create a mothman headlamp but screwed up the code?
---
One "F" equals one prayer.
---
Can I put this on my Resume? Bethesda, if you're reading this, I'm willing to relocate and help out the community team!
---
Think of the sweet sweet memes
---
That's why I attach a pressure plate for normal use.  (I add a switch in case I want to lock the door open)  Step on the plate, the door opens.  A couple seconds later, the door closes.
---
Its not a bug
---
Yes, what about them?
---
Same.  Day 1 of patch I found Heavy Combat Armor Legs on Watoga Station vendor.  Have not seen any Heavy Combat Armor plans since then.
---
Even just a video or something like Rare does with their dev updates. 
---
I get that, but I disagree that people would find them unprofessional. Look at the Wendy’s twitter, they’re “unprofessional” all the time, and people love it. People **hate** the passive “everything is no big deal” tone of a lot of these types of announcements. I think people would appreciate an acknowledgment that they (Bethesda) fucked up (frame that however you’d like) and an honest explanation of what happened and what’s wrong with these issues. People are looking to forgive Bethesda, even if they admitted they didn’t really try.
---
Not everyone has Bloodied, and let alone mutations. Not everyone wants to be a min/max no life gamer like yourself. Just saying ❤️
---
Because X01 is a prototype and there aren't a ton of mods floating out in the world
---
I love that there are people like you who can respond to bug reports like the above with the actual fix.
---
Lol it's not good, my launcher still breaks before I can kill it. I can get it to less than 20% before the launcher breaks,  but that is without weapon artisan.
---
You can probably down one with weapon artisan before it breaks. My zealots actually has that affix and another 10% bonus while aiming. It's still trash but it's pretty much our only weapon that can even hit a flying SB.
---
Gotta love the mods for nuking this post without even notifying.
---
Evey weapon break faster after the patch some i think
---
On Xbox there's a workaround for bug number two by joining on a recent player. I would have done a hard reset, that is physically unplug the power from the console, after bug 3 occurred. The going rate for stable flux ain't no 1000 caps either, more like 15-50.
---
thoughts and prayers
---
That's a terrible idea for them.
---
pressure plates are in the game. and yea i want better indoor stairs.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, only that some people are only now experiencing this bug.
---
If I ever need someone to stand in for me when i'm getting kicked in the balls I'll call you.
---
Because you're certainly a glutton for punishment sticking with a dying game that's made no real progress in over 3 months.
---
that would be nice
---
hahahahahaha
---
thanks for this
---
&gt;The burden of proof is also on you.
---
you're the one making inaccurate statements that go against the status quo.
---
&gt;I gave you specific examples and reasoning
---
&gt;yet you still continue to hold a subjective grudge.
---
let me show you why you're wrong:
---
&gt;If you were caught cheating in H1Z1 you had to make a YouTube video apology for cheating; Tickets not being answered is also a constant problem in games like BDO or GW2; GTA 5 on PC didn't even run or work for almost a whole week; Diablo 3 and Error 37 locked out gamers for a few days; Ubisoft, Target, Blizzard, have also leaked cc information
---
you see what those statements have in common? *each* of those games/companies *individually* checked *a* box. Fallout 76/Bethesda checked **all** of them. multiple times. that's reason 1, as for reason 2:
---
&gt;If you were caught cheating in H1Z1 you had to make a YouTube video apology for cheating.
---
did they also wrongly flag people for cheating? or continue to do so for that matter?
---
&gt;Tickets not being answered is also a constant problem in games like BDO or GW2.
---
do they set a timer themselves though, telling players that if they fail to reply before it expires, their accounts will be deleted? and then proceed to do so when they fail to meet their own timer?
---
&gt;GTA 5 on PC didn't even run or work for almost a whole week/Diablo 3 and Error 37 locked out gamers for a few days
---
but was it eventually fixed, properly? or did those games continue to suffer from issues present on release that rendered them virtually unplayable, months later?
---
&gt;Ubisoft, Target, Blizzard, have also leaked cc information.
---
but was it to other costumers who did nothing except trying to open a ticket?
---
&gt;The fact you say 76 dcs are the worst ever then say it's a fact shows how little experience or understanding you have.
---
2.5 months after release, would any of those games consistently disconnect players several times in a row in a span of less than 10 minutes or generally refuse to work for more than an hour at a time?
---
you keep on downplaying the situation. yes, everything that's happened to Fo76 happened to other games. but nowhere near to the same extent. and to quantify this extent, it's so bad that the game has become a laughing stock. few people remember early D3 anymore, but I can guarantee you nobody will ever forget Fo76 on release. it's the same as NMS, the game has become decent, but it'll always be picked on because of its release. except Fo76 was even worse. who could've imagined that Bethesda would mess up so many things in succession, but against all odds, they did.
---
that's how bad it is.
---
Very nice of you to do that. 
---
When you go to the hopper items are filtered, what the problem happens to be is when you tap a to drop the first item in there that is filtered often a pile of ammunition or one of your best pieces of armor or guns will show up in the list and you are already pressing a again.
---
For some reason the filter blips for a second and something else can fill its spot.
---
I went to do this a week ago. Killed 7 of them and then some other dude killed the other 3 of 'my' golfers. Keep checking in about once a day too see if they'll show up again and instead I more or less keep getting my ass handed to me by level 62 legendary bloated glowing ghouls. The good news is I've finally got enoug XP to (almost) hold my own now. (Though I'm still more likely to be all 'Run Away! Run Away!' than 'Bring it!')
---
I never used it in 76, but I did do another Fallout 3 playthrough last year and used the crafted weapons as much as possible. Gotta love nailing super mutant body parts to the wall with the Railway Rifle. 
---
I'd love to see it become viable in 76
---
This⬆️
---
Oh wow I thought this was gonna be another entitled "I deserve compensation for putting up with your game" but this is actually a problem that needs to be addressed.
---
 I grind atoms every day and actually find it relatively enjoyable so I agree with this OP. 
---
They were supposed to fix this two updates ago, hopefully it's not due to some "drip-feed" mentality and is an actual bug they're having trouble with
---
And cheap af to craft with easy to access junk 
---
There's crossbows?
---
Thanks for sharing 
---
Having an issue with crazy weight fluctuations. Showing over-encumbered even though I am far below my weight capacity. 
---
Enemies health bar almost seems spongey, every shot takes damage but there’s a tiny bounce back where they gain a tiny bit of life back after every shot. 
---
Even low level enemies seem to be taking an awful lot of bullets to kill after patch 5. I’m not using any explosive or two shot weapons. Lever action with maxed rifleman perks. It was taking down level 5-10 super mutants with one shot but now 2 shots for level 5 and 3 or more for level 10. That seems pretty ridiculous to me. High level enemies are almost unapproachable at this point. I do almost zero damage to Scorchbeasts. 
---
That's what I had to do but it's super unnecessary. Just swap the functionality of the switches and problem solved. 
---
I agree that marketing of the game was not ideal. It really should have been sold as a beta. However, it can still be argued that since the game is considered a service and not a stand alone product, that any patrons of the service around launch time are early adopters. 
---
Did you really use 20+ hours to gather 50 raw flux. Oh man. I can gather 150 In just 20min or so. There's several other issues with your story that doesn't add up. Just my saying.
---
I enjoyed that story.  Thank you very much.
---
And the surgical masked doesn't work with capped hat either. But it works with grey knitted hat. Was so disappointed when the scout mask didn't work with the grey knitted hat. (Beanie,)
---
I agree with that, I think it's cheaper to repair those than it is to repair an extractor though.
---
I've seen some pretty ingenious use of those boards at workshops lately.
---
Actually, we need a momentary switch.  That would solve it - and put the keypads on the outside, not the inside.
---
Thats funny, it'd never happen, they don't listen to the community, they just back-step and do their own things
---
Or at LEAST make the keypad switch just not do anything. I was more using the security door as an example of how the functionality should work. It's there - but you cant touch it, only the code operates it .
---
Why aren't people tired of all the bullshit Bethesda has put people through yet? I'm officially done and over with Fallout 76 and Bethesda.
---
As I don't use pistols, and I do not care, I will neither upvote or downvote this post, but i leave these words in recognition that someone may care one way or the other, and acknowledge their decision. 
---
Display Items-most importantly i believe you "need" to make the stands for these things cost budget and the Items part of your stash so we can not ever have a weird hotdog to hotdog bun situation.
---
 - Power Armor - with viable stats when looked at by friends such as the Legendary bonuses
---
 - Weapons - same as above
---
- items - bones, toys, bottles, books, bobbleheads, and comic book racks.
---
-pillow for my bed.
---
At this point I'm just trying to get through the main quest to be done with the game. I'm currently only level 20 and I'm on the last Free States quest.
---
People would track down your camps for the express purpose of shooting your babby
---
Happy to help, Keyword filters normally work really well...   
---
Here is hoping they start using the data we have been trying to give them since the BETA. ;) 
---
The first time I absolutely thought I must have done something, second time I was specifically paying attention because I bulked all the most expensive stuff for a quick run and lost it all.
---
So yeah, game is still screwing us now and then without even dropping/scrapping.  Why do I still love it anyway?
---
Wait THAT'S it? Are you kidding me!? They don't keep notes on how they fixed this shit? They couldn't just roll it back and fix the patch?? (the irony) are we sure they know what they're doing because it seems like they don't.
---
CAMP ISSUE - this last fix caused the already patchy keypad doors, and powered gates to stop working. One switch overrides causing the door to stick close and not reopen. Troublesome indeed.
---
&gt; I would have thought the Somerset special would have an increased AA value with it being a unique variant.
---
Yeah, I thought that too until I quickly realized all of the named legendaries were just shittier versions of a comparable 1-3★ legendary. Even All Rise being the best out of them is still a lot worse than a great roll 3★ Super Slege even a 2★ one if you don't mind the weight.
---
I still really like this idea OP. Maybe synths
---
ESO is more in the vain of WoW and FFXIV.
---
FO76 is more in the vain of GTAO
---
Different types of online experiences have different approaches.
---
You do realize that you can just turn the wall around so the keypad is on the outside, right?
---
Try reducing lighting quality to medium, I don’t notice the difference, also, distance sliders can make huge difference to stuttering in areas with many objects 
---
Love the franchise not the developer &lt;3
---
You'll notice my post says nothing about it being an open world RPG grind that is the issue. The balance is shit, and the bugs ruin the game on many levels. I could write a literal essay on how poor the design choices are, but I think the community has spoken well on most issues that have turned us all away.
---
I want Bethesda to know they should release a full game next time. Hoping a dev or two saw it. Thanks to capitalism their main concern was to make money, but they betrayed their fans pretty hard in the process. They have become the laughing stock of gaming, and it's not because of reactionary youtubers, its almost every community based around FO76 that is shitting on the game. I'm not looking down on people who still enjoy playing, I feel bad that ALL of us could be playing and enjoying it together, and it's a shame Bethesda gave us the middle finger as they drive away in their truckload of money, while we sit here with a half finished game, with not one redeeming quality.
---
There is that flying armored suite game Anthem doing some kind of test/access this weekend.
---
But will they start using it?  
---
We've been giving them problems and some of the solutions since the BETA and we kind of feel like they are falling on Deaf Ears.  
---
Since you are playing to not be seen or hit, then consider Adrenal Reaction too for some bonus damage when you are low on health.  The idea being that you keep your health low with radiation to gain the bonuses. 
---
U have kids op?
---
1.) What platform are you playing on? Xbox One X
---
2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account WAYNESTATON
---
3) Videos/screenshots of the issue (if applicable) - 
---
4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
Quest keeps respawning after I turn in technical data but I don’t get the last underarmor mod plan – I have the other variations of the lining Final Quest in BoS questline, Handing in technical data to camp Venture … 
---
5) Bethesda Customer Support Ticket Number (if applicable)
---
Agree. All the quest rewarded unique weapons and armour should be upgradeable just like the MoM pistol and sword.
---
Is that what happened? Cuz last night I almost wet my pants cuz a putrid glowing Wendigo showed up at Whitesprings and I put on that dumb dirty clown outfit and finally put that m-fer down. And I swear I got like 250Xp and some caps and I was ecstatic that the quest went away. But then this morning I logged in for a minute and the quest was STILL there. So I mean what is this quest never going away?
---
I'd like to see this, but I feel like it would just devolve into the same stuff as Twitter comments.
---
I think explosives could have an interesting niche as status effect weapons that are worth running. Sure, I want them to deal big damage with the right person loadout, but at base level it would be neat if you had some stuff like
---
Shrapnel - Always crippled a random limb, 2 on direct hit.  
---
Cryo - Slowed enemies until they died/ pvp ended.  
---
Diseased - Inflict a random disease with a timer set to 5 minutes
---
Irradiated - Inflict a random mutation + rad damage
---
Purifying - Suppress all buffs/debuffs for 5 minutes
---
Incieneary - create an area that Burns continuously for the next 2 minutes and causes damage if you stay inside it
---
Tar - create an area that requires ap to move through (over encumbered style)
---
Stim-powered - anyone hit directly gets a stimpack effect, anyone in splash zone gets diluted effect
---
Pushing - pushes anyone in the splash zone and deals damage
---
Those were off the top of my head. If the effects were weird I can see them being used for fun
---
Most people don't know how atom farming will look like, once you have done all challenges. It's very limited and a lot of effort for literally nothing.
---
They think, Bethesda will throw Atoms at them. In the end, you can barely buy something good. Weeks of farming for a simple hat from Fallout 4.
---
I had 179 bobbypins when they broke the weight of em, it made me sad selling most of them
---
My VATS just stopped working altogether since the hotfix yesterday.  
---
If you want to know ways around it, try using the perk that increases stimpak effectiveness (forget its name) or using class freak, which makes the negative effects of mutations weaker, or both!
---
Or use bloodsucker and sell your stimpaks 🧛🏻‍♂️
---
Oh jeez, I was there when the shitstorm happened on the no man's sky reddit and that was by far a worse experience than what's happening here, it took hello games well over a year to redeem that game. That sub was by far more toxic than this sub and r fallout combined, so much in fact the moderators shut down the sub.
---
So I think I can stand a bit of punishment tbh lol
---
I have 0 stealth perks or mutations, and I noticed this being prevalent Thursday night when I was playing. It was messing with my head because I kept being in a constant Caution state at my camp. When this happens, I search for the offender and destroy them before going  about my business. Well that night. . . He/they were apparently using a stealth boy or 10, because there were no hostiles for miles. Weird, oh and this was on PS4 btw.
---
Can't wait to see them in the atom shop where I'll have to pay 500 atoms for a chessboard that I can place in my camp.
---
In case it has not already been mentioned, the weapon durability issue is not isolated to energy weapons. I can directly attest to a significant increase in the rate at which rifles break since this last patch.  Specifically for Handmade, Lever, and Hunting rifles.  I’ve been forced to carry 4 rifles around so I’m not jumping back to camp to repair as often.  
---
Mostly water might be Speed Demon Negative effect 
---
being a decoration you could just repair it lol
---
They could do that already if they wanted to, they don't need to add support for that, I don't think you really understand how modding works
---
My T-51 bright headlamp is also marked as an atom shop item. lol
---
Thanks for this u/Tybber42. We've been exploring deep dives into some of our systems like this for future Inside the Vaults and specifics on C.A.M.P. is one we'd like to do very soon. We'd love to have feedback on other topics we could go into as well. 
---
Team of 40.
---
2 are working on bugs
---
38 are working 24/7 on atom shop
---
0 are working on being able to put a Teddy Bear on a shelf
---
I've literally tried every combo of perk cards and nearly every legendary weapon, melee, ranged, heavy or not.  
---
Range needs help, I have no problem with a Vanilla SuperSledge Oneshotting a Ghoul, just like I think a Vanilla fully upgraded Hunting Rifle should one shot the same Ghoul (assuming you hit the head ;) )
---
It would be better the idea of ​​doing something so that our character can jump walls or be able to be with the whole body on the floor.  
---
This seems to be the norm, having to wait for items to spawn, honestly thats pretty fucking broken.
---
Scrap baby get fertilizer.... 
---
An AMA with BGS would be useless as 90% of the posts would be salty expressions they would not answer.  
---
You should quit ANY game after 550 hours, even if it was flawless and made by God himself.
---
New atom shop items
---
Are you kidding me?! Man, I've been patient but fuck, they can't get anything right. 
---
there's a lot of people giving advice but also a lot of people that aren't and are just bashing the game, like you saying I don't have the right to like a game because you think it's shit
---
Lmao, you are just a little cry baby, you are probobly one of the people crying about how it takes you 50 bullets to take down a scorchbeast, im sure it is intended to feel that way, they are fuckin mini bosses, you dont need to be dealing 500 damage with your weapons unless you are gonna kill the queen, and just saying, i dont min/max most of the time, i kill everything just fine with a handmade rifle
---
I know that area well as I used the inside of Emmet disposal to farm mutations for a couple weeks.  The high level scorched aren't as tough as other high level creatures.  It would definitely take some doing, but it's possible to take down at your level.  
---
I'm almost positive the high radiation wasn't coming from him.  That site has super high radiation pockets all over the area, and some are not as obvious as usual with glowing barrels everywhere.  You were probably bumping into those high radiation pockets during the fight.  They have caught me by surprise quite a few times.    
---
I love the idea of tiered bulking:
---
* 1 Steel Scrap = 0.03 lbs
---
* 10 Steel Scrap = 1 Stack of Steel = 0.27 lbs (0.03 * 10 * 0.9), weight savings of 0.03 lbs
---
* 10 Stacks = 1 Pallet of Steel = 2.43 lbs (0.27 * 10 * 0.9), weight savings of 0.57 lbs
---
* 10 Pallets = 1 Crate of Steel = 24.87 (2.43 * 10 * 0.9), weight savings of 5.13 lbs
---
Each level of bulking reduces the weight by 10% (so not a big deal, but in large quantities it would add up). Each level of bulking could require 2 Plastic, still, so bulking is not *free*. 
---
Smart man . Wish i could push the button 
---
Another thing is the Broadsider.
---
I have thousands of lead, which is all that cannonballs require.
---
It seems decent if you have max Grenadier and the mutlishot canister, but there is a stupid downside.
---
The cannonballs count as ballistic ammo instead of explosives,  and they weigh 1 lb each. I discovered this when I made 500 cannonballs last night and couldn't move.
---
Since Bear Arms doesn't apply to the AGL, and the missile launcher and fat man aren't so hot right now, I think I'm going to swap my 3 point bear arms for 2 points in bandolier and 1 point in strong back.
---
I can then just carry my AGL, All Rise, and Broadsider.
---
If you can get the cannonballs to 0.1 weight with bandolier and a multi shot canister, I think the Broadsider will be quite ammo efficient for clearing trash.
---
Broken.
---
I think Bethesda did listen to ESO feedback and that's why we got a Fallout game that plays like a Fallout game instead of an Elder Scrolls game that only looks like an Elder Scrolls game.
---
People don't remember but Google "boycott ESO" and you'll see the same drama posts that we get about 76. Except that game became one of the largest MMOs.
---
Nerds will always use drama and try to sway people having fun to boycott. "boycott and resist" lol
---
Could be, but you aren't.
---
I have the Vault tec workbench and I CANNOT use it in my CAMP. it changes positions every time I log and I have to move it back. yes it clips into walls and stuff.
---
&gt; Scrap baby get fertilizer.... 
---
Oh my I laughed soo hard on that one thanks lol
---
I know, humurous, just as this game has become.
---
More like April 2020. 
---
Many of us don't *need* more stash space. We truly want sorts and data that tell us what is consuming the limit. There are mods being used on PC that tell total weight by category (weapons, apparel, junk, etc) and total weight by item type. It is more important to know that I have 15 lbs of steel scrap not that an individual piece of steel weighs .03 lbs.
---
reminds me of the pizza man joke from SWBF2 community when people used to ask how many ppl were working on that game. it was like 2 ppl and the pizza man
---
love the entitlement.
---
"Game has bugs, we deserve free things"
---
No, but I want kids but probably won't happen.
---
I do have babysitting experience baby sitting my nieces 3 kids
---
Oh yeah, Fallout isn't realistic because most people are too stupid to know that eating a macaroni and cheese uncooked straight out of a carxboard box can't actually heal your bullet wounds in seconds. Christ, how pretentious can you be?
---
Yeah I've been just standing still in stealth mode alt-tabbed (two screens so I can still see my game in windowed mode) and just randomly pop into [Danger] without a single enemy or player in sight. Wouldn't go away until I relogged. Spent a good 5 minutes just running around looking for any kind of enemy in the vicinity and found nothing.
---
Similar situations have been plaguing my gameplay since the patch. Thank God this toon's build is melee (AKA the _only_ working build at the moment). 
---
Can I be your second?
---
I hope so cause y'all are awesome.
---
That could also work, maybe even having it where that’s what the perk card does. Have the tse perk card I was talking about add the explosive area damage and have it on 3 perks and only let it go to 30% area damage (10% each).. That way we could have our damage back like your saying but also add only another 5% to the after patch 25%damage all together 
---
FO76 has been uninstalled towards the middle of December. I'm officially done with Fallout 76 and over with Bethesda. Never buying another Bethesda product again.
---
You would NOT want ESO's engine for Fallout unless you wanted a generic MMO with cooldowns and button rotations
---
Hope its the case of a bug as well, otherwise, pure evil haha
---
Not sure why Ive already been downvoted, seems to be a legit issue..
---
I thought so 😁 have 3 and i dont want kids in the game , but thats me lol
---
Explosive vent guy never walk without his single action revolver with ivory grip
---
Just make it so people who have completed the bunker buster quest be able to participate In it, would seem like a reasonable prerequisite no? A difficult mission that low levels won’t be able to achieve on their own, would prevent them from leeching the SBQ.
---
Same here. Completed the quest, about 30 min later I noticed it way back in my quests.
---
Can you enable a setting so that if I'm in pacifist mode (or add yet another on/off) and own a workshop that if someone goes to claim my workshop I can just... let them take it without flagging me for pvp?
---
We need synth babies now
---
They should put a chemistry station inside Artisan’s Corner.
---
Oh my I laughed soo hard on that one thanks lol 
---
Compared to the amount of health and damage resistance enemies have.
---
Try to fight some level 68 Supermutant with a regular rifle without legendary effects and you will know what I mean 
---
Lol maybe... We just want a stable game as well...   
---
I could be wrong, but the way I look at it, we won't get private servers until the game has been stable and the player base rebounds... So it's in all our best interests to get this fixed, quickly.
---
At this point, yes.  That has been my experience.  I was so sick of the damn quest I put the outfit on and went into the Wendigo Cave.  It was not a fun experience but I got the job done.  
---
I was very disappointed when I logged in again and the quest showed back up.
---
Same here my guy. I recently made a switch over to the prime .50 cal receiver. For my hunting rifle I have all the rifle cards maxed, sneak maxed, the sandman one maxed, whatever one does 2.5x sneak damage maxed, bloody mess and tenderizer. 
---
Anything you’d suggest? 
---
What cards do you have for the pistol? Just the gunslinger cards? I use a two shot single action but it’s trash after the patch and I’m looking for a better secondary. 
---
Because it accurately portrays reality? Xp
---
you think that's bad? meat hooks get bonuses from both unnarmed AND one handed.
---
so if a deathclaw gauntlet/power fist can output 20k damage with a power attack, a hook can deal roughly 60% more.
---
**a goddamn meat hook**.
---
I like the perk card breakdown, that would be super helpful when respecting after the fixes over and over. 
---
They’ve been looking into it since day one lol
---
Yeah, before the patch it was about 75% effective, now it's about 5-10%.
---
sounds like a solo player
---
A lot of people reporting on os4 but I haven’t gotten a chance to play so idk. 
---
Let's add to this energy weapons with SHOTGUN in the name not counting for shotgun perks. With how expensive it is to make shotgun shells I had really been looking forward to making a plasma shotgun as an ammo alternative, only to find out nine of my perks applied to it. 
---
It was frustrating but doable with Leon A.  I beat that in 6 hours.
---
I'm doing Claire B now, and i'm so pissed off I quit the game. I have a shitty six-shooter with horrid reload times, and 9mm that I only get ammo for if I craft it.  But if I craft it, I'm giving up potential ammo for the vastly superior grenade launcher (which I've actually found more ammo for than any other gun in the game; which is useless because I don't have it yet).  
---
Mr. X is ALWAYS right behind me.  If I outrun him, stop and check out a room, I come back out, and BAM he's down the hallway coming right for me.  My personal favorite was when I was running from X on the 2nd Floor, got away, ran up the stairs to the third floor, only to find Mr X walking towards the 3rd Floor landing.  The only way he could have gotten there was to punch through the damn ceiling and climb up, or teleport.  There is no other direct path from the SWAT office hallway to the ruined storeroom hallway.    
---
The zombies are CROWDED around the stairway near the Photo Lab save point.  One on the ground, and two on each landing.  Not enough room to dodge them without wasting precious ammo first, and not even head shots take them out for good.  I've seen the head explode on the one by the base of the stairs TWICE, but every time I come by that area, he's back and blocking my way.  
---
Path A was harsh but fair.  I'm pretty damn sure Path B is cheating its ass off.  
---
The splash damage must help out a lot. Only fat man I ever got that was worth a damn was a mutant's fat man. And +10% damage is hardly worth carrying 24lb worth of ammo.
---
Understand.
---
Anyway i found it like 3 times today, never found the long coat, pretty frustrating
---
I got a flare gun instead of a 3 drop legendary once.......not legendary just a shitty flare gun
---
Do you have low health and an Unyielding build on? Melee gets insane boosts from strength
---
Yeah, I already tried that... but it didn't work :(
---
I really don't get this. I got bored of Fallout 76 personally. At first I would film some and play each day for hours, not filming at all but just to experience it. Over time I got pretty bored of the game and made a video talking about that. 
---
I still (mostly) enjoy making videos on the game. That for me is very different than just playing it personally. You do some research, film some stuff, and edit it together. 
---
With the most recent update I read the patch notes and loved it. I don't think it'll get people back into the game, but for me at least it brought a lot of changes I think that make the game we have right now a bit more enjoyable. I film a video about that and post it. 
---
Later I find that the update shipped with some bugs and in reality most people aren't as happy as I was with the update. So I make a video talking about the bugs, but as I mention in that video I believe a massive part of it is how angry people are at the constant flow of nerfs. I didn't personally use TSE, PA, over carry weight, or any of the other things nerfed so it didn't seem like a big deal to me originally (and still isn't, but now I recognize why it is bother so many others). It's the union of people being pissed about nerfs and some new bugs that leads (IMO) to people calling for the update to be reverted and also overexaggerating how many bugs there were. So I made a video on that.
---
As a bug free update I still think it would be one of the best the game saw, that is evidentally not the popular opinion but again most of the nerfed stuff didn't effect my build/playstyle. You're comparing a video that is very indicative of my personal views to one that is more just covering what other people are saying. Perhaps the greater issue is I should be more clear which is which in my videos, but at the end of the day I don't think I flip flopped. I thought the update looked great, later saw the bugs it came with, but also that people were unhappy and talked about it. 
---
That's how I have it....
---
Why are you telling us this if you don't care? lol
---
As far as I know they only stopped explosive bobblehead stacking....Not tested
---
Do it
---
Wait till you get John Wickes fookin pencil. It can kill 3 enemies with one attack.
---
Thanks I am going to look for that. I too got my Sommerset Special at lvl 5 not knowing better. I had thought the diamond symbols meant I could upgrade it when I leveled up but I found out that is not how it works lol.
---
"it's not how I want it"
---
I'd love to see stars be toggleable. So you could equip a level 2 or 3 as needed and not need multiple versions of the same cards
---
Let me first thank you for helping keep that one together, but the one I really want to see is Bethesda's known list. That way we would have an idea what is on yours that should be on theirs. 
---
How do I get my refund already? This game is straight up bait and switch compared to the trailer and most of the player base agrees...just give me my money back already you scammers 
---
Wasn't aware of meat hooks. I know pipe rifles have/had something similar going on. 
---
I'm talking about two different objects. The switch with a keypad on it and the security door with the keypad on the front and the switch on the back. 
---
Keypad switch with no door - you can just flip the switch and bypass the keypad to turn power on.
---
Security door with keypad on the outside -  only the keypad activates the switch on the other side of the wall which turns power on and also opens the door.  You cant flip that switch at all, only the keypad flips it. 
---
Naw, it's a silly conversation about semantics, just having fun :)
---
There are several inside the Artisan's Corner.
---
Man I’m scared to do anything after a buddy of mine got banned for massively diluting stimpacks  I guess that was an “exploit” too
---
I'm beginning to think maybe I *am* just lucky.  Bureau of Tourism took me about 10 minutes to complete and was probably one of the easier quests in the game for me.  I didn't even really have to fight very many enemies.  Just complete the assigned task, fast travel to the next one, and repeat.
---
Of course. Damage mitigation isnt a issue with my build either, I tank alot at low health.
---
Yeah I mean there's so much COOL stuff and it's such a shame you can't look at any of it. Bobbleheads, Magazines, toys, armor, outfits, weapons. There's so much stuff that in 4 would go right on the wall and in a display case that I just have to say 'oh well' and junk it or sell it or drop it.
---
Also Bethesda if you're reading this there's one I think we should have which are dedicated storage containers for specific objects. They can count against our total world items but I just want to put outfits in a dresser and food in a cooler and chems in a first aid kit and stuff like that. Surely there must be some way to have containers that only show us part of our stored inventory.
---
Why bother? The full melee build can do more damage in the ten seconds of landed time than you can in a minute of shooting her in the air. Sad part is that I'm not exaggerating at all after the TSE nerf. 
---
That's true.
---
Yeah, sure, let's go with that.
---
Definitely not for combat, no. I agree. Fallout isn't an MMO. It just seems like there's parts that would work, and they're trying to reinvent the wheel. 
---
Is it only one star?
---
And the same would be true for any game in any state, and yet there exist persistently terrible games.
---
I do mostly play solo.  Do you think playing on a team could be what the difference is?
---
79 with probably the same gun, still takes me 2-3 headshots to kill things.
---
Thanks for seeing to this!
---
As a bit of constructive feedback regarding the list, either with this or future updates, could you please separate known issues that have yet to be fixed from issues that have been fixed? Presently it's a lot harder to know whether or not a problem needs addressing or has already been fixed than it needs to be.
---
you only think rad worms are fun until you have to take a rest break and have to try to pass said worms !
---
Looks like maybe it degrades with the number of shots.  I know some people broke 2 of them during queen fight.
---
MMO
---
Although that tag is wrong, as this is not an MMO.  This is not a massively multiplayer online game.  This is a multiplayer online game.
---
Pricing if you pay with money is a problem. The amounts are fine for atom only paying. Now if they actually wanted $18 dollars for skins I don't think they would get it
---
I have an new character I started with the intention of him being a Weapons Vendor, and another that's a Blacksmith (Armor Vendor), these characters are not Mules but are obviously Over Encumbered.
---
One of them is still OK since the patch, (200lbs +/- from the Max limit), but the other one who had around 2000lbs pre-Patch is now over 17000, which make no sense at all, I took several weapons off and the weight did not change removed all scrap &amp; it did not change, I can't figure out where the weight is coming from.
---
This would not be a serious issue, since he never goes anywhere but a short walk from spawn to CAMP. but the other issue is that I have a lot of caps on the character that I need with no way to get to them.
---
Is there a way to get the paint job back through learning plans???? I bought a jet pack but it wasn’t the same as my armor so I just went with standard. Missing the black n yellow lol
---
I'm sure some experiences are overly exaggerated, such as someone might crash twice in a couple weeks and say 'IT KEEPS FUCKING CRASHING", some people might just have shitty luck however and everything bad that could go wrong with this game, just happens to go back with them.
---
😪 *Says a salty TSE user* even if they nerf melee I have ranged builds, I have melee builds and I have stealth builds so it means little to me. The fact still stands if you cant kill a melee opponent then you suck at playing ranged.
---
Holy shot that sonic disruption Dragonrend reference just flirted me. That. Is. Perfect.
---
Well you're in for a rough ride, I'm betting in 6-8 months this game still won't be in a state worth playing with the rate of updates and how Bethesda's been treating them. Not to mention having actual content to do aside from killing ghouls in Whitesprings and killing the SBQ after running a nuke silo and praying you don't disconnect. They really are clueless to balancing and running an online game. At this point I wish FO76 would have been a 4 player co-op experience instead of a pseudo MMO. Maybe if that's the case they could have made a fun and balanced game you could play with friends without worrying about all the problems the current game has.
---
The saddest fact about you mentioning No Mans Sky was it was a small independant company that was too small for the ambitions and had to rush out a product to get Sony off their backs. Bethesda boasted that FO76 is the biggest game with the most devs working on it they've ever had. Multiple teams across several studios worked to create FO76 and yet here we are with a game with more bugs than content. 
---
You can dream and write up suggestions for the game until your fingers are sore but the problem is Bethesda already shipped FO76 and it's old news. It sold poorly, had poor reception and as such it won't have nearly the people working on keeping it going with content updates as it did when it was in development (and well honestly that didn't seem to help anyways?).
---
The whole point of my post isn't to be negative or to whine, I'm done with the game. I gave it a chance, and another chance, and another. It's too far gone and it's time we realize that and move on with our lives. Let's just pray that if there is a Fallout 5 it's actually a game worth $60 and worth spending time in.
---
This is hilarious. It doesn't matter what you "asked for" the game was never going to be single-player co-op.
---
Good lord this sub...
---
So MORPG? Not MMO?
---
Yep, it avoids the rare responder bot from spawning 
---
I also put away high damage weapons and just tag stuff if there are others around. Most of the time its a good group and we either go to the farming station by the pool, or stand in a semicircle around the doors and just light them all up when they charge out. People that build bases on the back side and people that charge in and greedily kill them all highly annoy me. 
---
Ive also run into a couple lowbies trying to get the sword out of the condos and cleared the way for them since all the charred were level 62. I always damaged them to allllmost dead, let the level 20 somethings tag them, and then finish if needed. 
---
Explosives are like you said,  a novelty.  
---
At this point they should just stick to game publishing instead of also developing them. Can't remember the last Bethesda made game I enjoyed 
---
Me too it's so annoying 
---
Explosives are more of a strategic thing.  I do like the feather light “Daisy Cutter”.  Good for when I feel like exploding lot of cars.  Super mutants...notsomuch.
---
Op vampire ched build incoming
---
You are not supposed to crit on every single shot buddy. That’s why there are perks to make you crit more often. 
---
It stills doesn’t matter what I asked for. But I’d still rather know who was asking Bethesda for what
---
I agree the pistols are cool but severely under-powered and not really viable compared to other weapon options. I do like pistols though and the idea of a gunslinger... I have my character looking like a cowboy with the hat and a long trench coat. 
---
It seems like this should be obvious to the developers as well so it makes me think they know about it but for some reason don't want to increase the damage of pistols. So... I was thinking what if you could dual wield pistols (could just be standard or a perk card)? I mean it doesn't make any sense that you can't already in-game. Pistols usually are for closer range anyway, so maybe make it if dual weilding, the range is reduced but the hip-fire is increased or something to make up for it. Because I don't see how they could make it dual wield and still be able to zoom in and use cross hairs with the controls set up... console or PC.
---
Pretty much its a really bad place to build. They get wrecked alot because it stops the event from happening. One of the event bits is a rare vendor to spawn.
---
That is a more accurate genre identifier, yes.  
---
You're better off uninstalling it. Seems they track how many people have their game installed, and the less people who have it installed, the more of a message will be sent. 
---
They have silver for blood
---
SP with CO-OP
---
I prefer playing alone, like FO4, but would like to play with others sometimes, trading, etc.
---
I don't want FO76 to become like Fortnite, etc.
---
yes any CAMP in this area will prevent the Charleston vendor from spawning, as such a lot of players consider any CAMP there to be interfering with game play and will destroy it on sight.
---
Avoid building here and behind the golf shop in WS.
---
In the [feedback post](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/) they are asking for our suggestions on decor items like this.
---
No thanks.
---
Oh man. I just killed it. Crap. What does the bot do? 
---
MMLFGA!!
---
that's a good compromise.  
---
free travel if you've already discovered the location.
---
Right this is more an issue from bloodied rather than melee. Though they probably WILL nerf str melee boosts.  A bloodied gun isn't equal to a bloodied melee because of that
---
 Anecdotally, yes, although that vendor does go through other locations as well (e.g. Flatwoods near the welcome sign on the southeast end of town).
---
I use bear hands to make it easy for me to carry 2 gatlings a missile launcher and my fatty
---
Which makes ya wonder why we prefered it on steam. Hell epic store will ban your entire account.
---
I know i understand that im not suppoed to and I am ok with nerfing my crits because they were stupidly op but now u cant use them at all
---
That is a great suggestion as well. Even having just a simple progress bar would be beneficial, especially combined with a timer. (Powering up for example can still be worth joining with 20 minutes left out of 60, but only if someone else has done enough of the steps)
---
I know there might be some concern that people would use this to jump in at the last second for cheap rewards, but  that could be mitigated easily by scaling rewards based on the percent of time spent in the event.
---
Can you people be anymore salty about your unbrokenly broken TSE trash? I think the answer is yes. Not a word was spoken about melee being too OP until your stupid TSE guns got needed and now oh melee is too OP its not fair! Wah wah wah. I hope Bethesda takes it up another notch I say if they nerf melee then they should completely remove explosive perk from guns and then what will y'all bitch about? Oh I know how broken your guns will really be.
---
What about around the snake logo at whitesprings?
---
progress timer doesn't work.  most events end when the objective is complete.
---
&gt;bulk
---
The need to add back the keyword "NoAutoScrapJunk \[KYWD:004ECBA8\]" that somehow got stripped in the Update from almost all "Bulk" Items
---
Create an Inventory tab for the C.A.M.P. that allows placement of items from your junk or weapons or armor as static C.A.M.P. decor at the cost of budget

---
We have them in fo76
---
&gt;Says a salty TSE user
---
I don't use TS. I hate the accuracy penalty.
---
&gt;The fact still stands if you cant kill a melee opponent then you suck at playing ranged.
---
I wouldn't say that considering a *good* melee player will just sneak 30K damage up your ass after a stagger. but ok.
---
the point is that melee is op. now **that's** a fact.
---
I visited Boston last summer. I told my wife I Wouldn’t go near the swan lake... too many behemoths for me 😀
---
Your issue is legit, and should be addressed by BGS
---
Your demand for compensation gets you the downvotes though, as it makes you appear entitled.
---
I think you’re full of shit. 
---
Damage is king. Who cares that you have to be close with melee when you kill everything short of a scorchbeast in one hit, and every non-player enemy just tickles you when you're in PA and then you heal it all back with healing factor. Oh, just one more little thing you skipped over, you don't use ammo XD. Just a minor detail lol. 
---
Weapon classes are very unbalanced and the last patch didn't do anything but make melee the clear king of efficient killing for anything other than regular scorchbeasts, even though it already was. The melee perks are stronger than ranged perks, you have more ways to buff yourself than ranged does, the mutations for melee are +25% damage while the one ranged mutation is +25% to crits only, and strength directly buffs your damage and gives you carry weight. That's not balanced imo. It more than makes up for having to hit things.
---
Don't nerf melee though. Stop nerfing shit and start buffing. The game is stale AF right now. Making players feel less powerful after all this time, with nothing new to do, is a recipe for people quitting. For every one of these people who says the game is more fun now because it takes longer to kill things, you have 10 people who are pissed off because they're weaker (as you can see by the ratio of posts here). 
---
I had a good two shot .44 that was in no way OP; now its flat out worse than just using a normal pistol due to the accuracy penalty of two shot and one of the projectiles missing if you arent well within shotgun range. 
---
Ok so buy this ammo for 6k, then I drop the armor for you. If it glitches you get a full refund
---
It waa basically an experiment to see if they could add network capabilities to Gamebryo
---
I was experiencing this bug at times even before most recent patch! But cannot confirm whether the patch had any impact as I stopped playing the game.
---
Wouldn’t that be detrimental to start explaining to people how to do that?
---
Yesss...
---
long long overdue!
---
Yeah I wouldn't bother with low health if it wasn't for Adrenal Reaction ,Nerd Rage and Unyielding. Bloody alone isnt that powerful.
---
Oh, I've had that luck before. Couldn't build my camp somewhere because the spot was already taken. Left the server, pressed play again, and I got put  right back to the same server.
---
Don't worry it's that your info is being passed around until it finds where the buck stops
---
This almost needs its own thread, I just figured this out about an hour ago when I was trying to get some ore for ammo and repairs. The rarer ores not respawning on server hop are going to cause major issues for weapons like the plasma rifle which uses a lot of copper for ammo.
---
I'd say it's more GTA:O combined with something like Destiny or The Division
---
I get they have a lot of JOKE weapons out there but they should NOT be allowed as a possible roll on high level loot tables.
---
They've always done this, it just helps the Player as you should always have a ton on you. If it's realism you want... then go out side. 
---
U cant use 2 crits in one use of the VATS

Take a look at my thread powering through west tek with a legendary pipe rifle that **doesn't** have bloodied, 2 shot, explosive or any of that stuff. All it has is 50% armor reduction. I'm also not even running tank killer.
---
I even one shot the level 62 mutant Primus near the end.
---

Neon Letters are one of the easiest to see examples.

Also, we should be able to Snap 1x1 second floors to the Long Staircase.
---
On player vending, open up some of those locked rooms in Whitesprings and let people rent a stall for a certain number of caps and let them supply their personal vendor with the stock of items they have for sale.
---
Yeah it's ridiculous. I have a friend and she got a mole miner's gauntlet up to 1900. With swing speed!
---
I just want the ones were all entitled to. If Ive done the challenges, if YOUVE done the challenges, then we are entitled. I didnt ask for FREE Atoms, just the ones, yes, we are entitled to.
---
Agree, who thought good game design was to encourage players to not do the quests?  
---
I learned with my 2nd on characters to wait until 50
---
Generally safe, but high traffic and I see a lot of camps there, so possibility of not being able to place.
---
Keep it away from the golf club with turrets on it and most people dont care.
---
A good compromise is to use colors AND some type of obvious symbol or icon that also indicates the status. Like maybe an hourglass icon with different fill amounts, or even just multiple hourglasses for longer time on the clock.
---
Holy Crap I didn’t realize that!
---
I dunno, I have seen plenty of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood and other B movie westerns that used alcohol in a bottle with a soaked rag for a wick to believe that they weren't invented until the 20th century. We all know that if the Duke or Clint Eastwood had it in their movies it has to be accurate.  /s
---
I'm not familiar with the switch without the door.  Can it be configured by the terminal?  Perhaps it has a different mode.  Otherwise why would it even exist?  
---
The switch on the door cannot be manually operated at all, but you can add a second one next to it.
---
It's just a game dude

I'm right there with you.

The Super Duper Proc sound will continue until it finishes all the queu'ed SuperDuper hits in my experience.

You can rebuild it at a higher level at a workbench. Just don't get rid of it and upgrade it to your current level.

Cry me a river dude. Learn how to build your class. If you let a player *sneak* up on you then you're a trash player and don't hand me that stealthboy or chameleon armor bullshit I can see those people coming from a mile away and easily keep a mile between us ya know why?? Cause sneaking can not move as fast as someone standing straight up and running. Your points are *irrelevant* 
---
where on earth did you think fallout, or video games in general were supposed to be based on reality.
---
They accidentally removed the keyword NoAutoScrapJunk \[KYWD:004ECBA8\] from almost all the Bulk items.  
---
Hopefully they will add it back.  
---
I think you’re hearing what you want to hear louder than what’s being said.

“But I know a guy (or I am myself) who plays on PS4 disproves your theory” - what you just did - isn’t someone tainted in statistics would ever frame anything.

They're working very hard to get more into the atom shop as we speak.

Working on making 76 a finished product? They'll get around to it.

im the same, i got the Email about a month ago and no atoms. Also kinda a bummer that the canvas bag is gonna take 4-6 months to arrive. But at least you are still getting one.

Yeah, the flowers thing has been infuriating... It's an impossible reward to collect.
---
I didn't bother crafting anything, I just ran around gathering empty bottles of all kind and selling them. I specifically ignore beer bottles since they aren't consumed by the scrap all junk. Gee what a concept. 
---
Calling TSE a build is comical. It's just an easy button for lazy people.
---
Just happened earlier this morning meaning I stayed up after 5AM to help out, only to have us all dtopped with around 10 secs left.......WTF
---
Alternate perspective - they're still Bethesda employees, and may not actually be able to reply to threads like this without risking their job. They also have to be very careful with what they say. 
---
Acid bulk used to scrap for some extra free acid, pretty sure they patched that.
---
see, now what they'll do is nerf black powder weapons so they do less damage than mini nukes, rather than buff mini nukes since that's what they SHOULD be doing instead of nerfs.
---
ESO was an eventually victory, they'll make improvements and updates. ESO got these same "THIS IS AWFUL WE NEED TO BOYCOTT ESO" posts in 2014 that 76 is getting in 2018/19. Now it's one of the best MMOs out there, but still not great if you're a Skyrim fan
---
They'll pass this info along don't you worry
---
With my death claw, I take about 1/8 of scorched queens health on every swing, it's crazy. That's only sitting at around 4k dmg, couldn't imagine 10k+
---
Get real. The engine is Bethesda. It’s another element of their incompetence. The animations look like shit in creation, it’s been glitchy as fuck for forever. Do you remember Skyrim launch? 
---
The engine is probably the worst in modern gaming. It looks like last gen polygons and animations with upscale textures, which only happens sometimes lol
---
yea, a timer isn't going to work for everything, there is no 1 solution...
---
for defend:  show the wave 1/4 and wave progress
---
for uranium fever:  timer
---
for horde events so how many spots have been checked
---
for powering up a power station: show the three progress meters
---
or even as simple as...
---
if no one has started the quest yet, then the timer before it despawns
---
if someone is doing it... even just showing whatever they see as their progress.
---
might not solve EVERY quest's issue, but would sure be a hellova lot better then the roulette we currently have
---
later bruh, you totally stuck it to the man with this post
---
Plans for Heavy Combat Chest. Because BOS is a mod you apply, like dense or pocketed. I just learned you can apply BOS to Heavy Combat too. But I think you need separate plans i.e. Combat BOS Chest and Heavy Combat Chest. look me up astro13 if you want to make a chest piece for you.  
---
Cats out tha bag yo.  
---
we have 171k people in this sub, even if 100% of them didnt know how to dupe, and they all learned from here, and duped, we would have added a total of about 2% of the players knowing how and duping.    
---
But it's quite clear that more than 2% of people know how and are duping.  So talking about it here would have negligible impact on the game itself, though it might make this sub furious.
---
isn't 500 atoms like $4.99? That's kind of a slap in the face.
---
i have seen this several times on XB1
---
This used to happen to me at Watoga, way before the latest patch / hotfix. The robots would just drop dead at the very sight of me :-D
---
He sells the Hunter's longcoat
---
Honestly this is the best idea for junk decoration I’ve heard yet
---
Sorry. Just not interested. Your comparison is stupid. End of. Have a nice day. 
---
It's actually a really good place to build, it's a bad place to put a rare spawn. No other farms like that
---
Used to happen to me until the first major patch. It appears to be back now. Had it happen in Harper's Ferry and Watoga last night. 
---
That's so stupid!
---
That's like saying i need a plastic cup to attack a robber, instead of a frying pan to the head!
---
think I'll log in and out a ton see if new plans show up
---
It's doubling the base carry weight bonus for the excavator. Excavator has +100 carry weight compared to the other PAs, and it get's applied twice sometimes if you load while in it, bumping you up to the CW you'd have if you had installed Calibrated shocks. Getting out and back in resets this to where it should normally be with the straight +100. 
---
Method is tossing your stuff in a fissure and relogging
---
Where to sell flux for 1000 cap? I sell it for 100 usually.
---
All of the Optimized Bracers use this as the "Parent" OMOD for their effect.  
---
\_PARENT\_mod\_PowerArmor\_GENERIC\_Optimized "TEMPLATE: Optimized Bracers" \[OMOD:003D4E59\]  
---
It has the following Errors in it.  
---
It has the keyword PA\_RustyKnuckles\_AV \[AVIF:0020D96F\] when it should be using the keyword PA\_OptimizedBracers\_AV \[AVIF:0022B645\]  
---
It has the Enchant EnchPowerArmor\_CommonArm "PA Common Arm" \[ENCH:00248490\] in it, when it should be using EnchPowerArmor\_OptimizedBracers "Optimized Bracers Left" \[ENCH:0018354D\].  
---
It's been reported multiple times before, back as far as the BETA, and we are hoping to see a fix soon.
---
&gt;Learn how to build your class.
---
I could spent decades building my class and never be able to output 50k damage. now this is a crazy idea, but *maybe* that means melee is op.
---
&gt;Cause sneaking can not move as fast as someone standing straight up and running.
---
you do know stealth boy works while you're *standing up and running*, right?
---
&gt;I can see those people coming from a mile away
---
categorically false. if you're wanted, a sneak attack could come from anywhere. can you see through walls? or maybe through mountains if they have the high ground.
---
Thank you
---
I got an email yesterday too, same shit brotha
---
Well, you see when two people love each other very much, and they both consent, they mush body parts together and poof! 9 months later a little dup is pushed out of mommies parts..
---
Jerry Miculek would like a word with you sir.. j/k  
---
Indeed i have had my eye on it abit. Once i learnt of the rare spawn i quickly gave up hope of building there as i love that spawn. Then ofcourse i installed text chat.. so now i can easily get him and Grahm any time i need them.
---
Dont feel bad I *bulked* a handful of materials this morning before I left for work and when I walked to the stash box to stash them *poof* they were gone
---
Nope sorry, they used the red tactical file as the base for the new Atom shop item, Mothman HeadLamp. but ended up replacing the file instead of copying it. As such all red tactical headlamps now require the Atom store purchase permission to be installed which we cannot get as it is not being sold yet.
---
save it for when the fix it, but expect them to break something else.
---
Honestly if I play non stop all week before patch my guns won’t even break. I only fix to get back over 100%.  So a fix on that is understandable. I do run with gunsmith rank 5 to get this.  I know without the perk guns break stupid fast
---
Patch 5 was what killed it for me, and many others. I kept holding out hope that with every update the game would get better. It just seems to get worse. Yes, they're fixing things, but they're doing it by breaking an equal, if not greater amount of things. 
---
The CAMP system is the only fun part about the game to me at the moment, and I hit max budget the other day. 
---
Exactly. The one I'm referring to is this: 
---
https://imgur.com/a/QIICEAW
---
The keypad is purely there to flip the switch *which you can also just do manually*. It's literally pointless. 
---
There are other places to spawn the vendor I think but no amazing farm spots like that
---
It also appears something is up with mods not scrapping. Definitely had the issue of all bulk scrapping but I was making ammo last night and now my X01 jetpack is missing. Thought this was safe?! Had to back out of a trade scheduled for this weekend.
---
I got a fuse off a three star legendary earlier today, I'm hoping it's a fuse for my Tesla gun to make a legendary one. 
---
glad I could help
---
Start leveling into Enforcer immediately. You'll be able to take on anything.
---
or just go simple:  free travel to events
---
Hire the Modders 
---
Right, agreed, but that's not what happened here...
---
And you just took the opportunity to go off on another rant...
---
Are we going for three?  
---
Made my first character a gunslinger, made it to lvl 50 with him. It was very rough the whole time, never found a good legendary pistol and ended up using a pipe pistol and .44 for most of the game. 
---
Yeah "nuka cola" I'm sure thats what you want. Comon man no need to hide the need for a cold beer.
---
Too late to farm karma points
---
yeah pretty much can switch for melee or shotgun.
---
and wow thats really good build! nice!!!
---
\&gt;I encounter these bugs individually at least once, if not more, every day I play.
---
This is the key. Nearly all of those things I've experienced. And I've mentioned them here and people have said "Don't worry it won't do that anymore" (camp lost), or "they've fixed that now" (hundreds of caps getting drained when it said it would only cost 30 caps) and so on. Thing is. Nothing's been fixed. Not really. The game is a broken mess and Beth have lost the ability to improve it. 
---
The very first time I launched my own nuke the game crashed as it detonated and I lost the zone.
---
I worked my ass off to save caps for a (yeah probably duped but so what) TSE and that's been nerfed to the ground. I farmed and farmed and farmed and traded my way up. I ran cap stash routes over and over which you now can't. I killed SBs with all my ammo and got... nothing. I switched servers a billion times to get X01 mods, made a new account for handmade plans, logging in and out and in and out to see if the vendors had those rare items, and now they do just let me pick the pieces I want (not X01) they'll have tripled the price.
---
\&gt;The gameplay is so much fun, but its impossible to play when the biggest enemy you face in the game is the game itself.
---
We said somthing about it last week. Fucking Ladydevann actually replied and said "were looking into it". Then it shows up again. 
---
Theyre laughing at us, folks! And douchebags like this "Amazing" dude below is right there circlejerking with them...
---
sounds like you got your money's worth. Take a nice break, check out the sun maybe, and come back later.
---
What about the keypad on the tower?  Does that one work?
---
eso team isn't the 76 team. what you say is possible but comparing the two justifies it can happen just because of the bethesda name don't cut it.
---
Indeed one of my favorite bits of end game. Is just traveling around and looking for good build locations. Sometimes i just build a base to see what could be then pull it back down again on the next move.
---
Hey dad 
---
I get legendaries from common things all the time I think the names are bugged
---
When I was playing, I had noticed that either storing, retrieving, or equipping a tesla rifle was causing blue screen fairly frequently. *shrugs*
---
The OP is bitching about a nerf, about a weapon combination that still absolutely destroys normal weapons.
---
God made the game people play for years
---
lol very true, but I thought that is what this was going to be!
---
Wot
---
bloodied baseball bat?
---
My fallout 4 survival build was an agility/luck gunslinger. Most fun build ever. Late game the vats cutscenes do take about 5 minutes to process with all of my AP.
---
Can you make non-power armor builds viable on endgame without having to wear NO armor? Like hazmat suits that don’t take up ALL slots or something? Popping Rad-X and RadShield is a nuisance and makes mutations useless...
---
The problem is that some of the people reporting the kinds of huge, game-breaking issues don’t even own the game, let alone play it...
---
I don't care if it's in a brown paper bag, shooting a bench press set of weights in a brown paper bag at anything is going to leave a mark.

---
ESO team was a bunch of nobodies before, and ESO wasn't anything like how it is now. Same can happen for this game, probably will. Google 'boycott ESO' and behold all the similarly salty posts from 5 years ago. Honestly the game probably won't ever get good in a lot of people's eyes but will find its own population like ESO did
---
Terrible analogy....
---
That bat yes (searing rocked mod on), what do you have in mind?
---
That's a fair assessment, thanks
---
Yeah, people like this cannot just skip over shit or walk-away.  Being a dick just validated their existence.  They are broken and there isn’t any fix unless they actually take a good hard look at themselves.  So don’t waste your time, ever, on them.  
---
Method involves tse... throw it in suitcase at nearest train station...spam interact with vendor and relog. Item will disappear from your inventory but you should mysteriously receive 5$ from paypal
---
&gt; However bring on the hate the TSE 200% to 50% was for the better, and brings more diversified game play and weapon choices. 
---
Sorry but I'd be at least a little skeptical of the opinion of the guy who thinks Bloodied Explosive and Furious Explosive weren't good enough to use on any weapon or build over those big bad mandatory TSE's until they slashed Two Shot's effectiveness to a quarter of what it once was.
---
Thank you, dropped all my blanks and it worked perfectly. Surprised this is still a bug.
---
Is that a different one? The one in talking about it about as tall as a character. Are you talking about the pylon one? I saw references to it but haven't actually seen it.
---
Then I’m saying they need to bring on some members of the ESO team or just have them train the 76 team. They just need help right now.
---
Man, if I had reddit gold I’d give it to you. This is very well written and thought out. 
---
I haven't touched fallout 76 after the new patch, but as soon as I heard mutations were breaking because of the rad worm disease, I was afraid of logging on and losing all my hard earned mutations 
---
Put food in your stash, it doesn’t seem to decay.  At least, I have not run across any when I scrap my crops for the fruit/veg and fertilizer/
---
Jerry is not a person haha
---
Either way. Even if the one you're talking about exists and does work, the one I'm talking about is broken and should be addressed. 
---
&gt; Kill Windingo in Clown Suit - does not ever complete.  Mentions of it being an issue using the clown suit from the Atomic Store. 
---
**As I understand the Quest:**
---
POI061\_HouseOfScares "Crack the Code" \[QUST:004F82B8\]  
---
It requires the following Armor Record to Complete:Clothes\_ClownOutfit "Clown Outfit" \[ARMO:0010CF7A\]  
---
HouseOfScaresOutfit \[KYWD:004F82BE\]  
---
Now we have limited ability to troubleshoot and test, but based on Fallout 4's Quest systems, replacing the Armor Record with a FormList with both the Basic and AtomStore versions of the Clown Outfit, and Adding the Keyword to the Clean, AtomStore version of the Outfit should/could fix it.  
---
Nothing in mind really, just wanted one with swing speed, at max caps that's all. IF you have others (melee) that need cap top up no problem..
---
Is there any chance issues with the "Class Freak" perk will be looked into?
---
Empath and Grounded are completely unaffected and it causes mutation negative effects to reduce SPECIAL stats by fractions instead of whole numbers which prevents other perks (such as Barbarian) from working properly when used with Class Freak as they appear to have not been programmed to handle fraction values. 
---
Yes, I mean the pylon one.
---
Yea no kidding... im playing tonight, ill test it lol
---
a better question would be why is two-shot still extremely innacurate considering it was nerfed to the ground
---
Two and a half men ran for 12 seasons.  Big Bang Theory is on season 12 as well.
---
Some people are just easily entertained.  
---
Not really. Takes about 1.5-2 mintues for me to fully reload in and then run to the vendor, took all of 30-45 seconds with this method. But that's if you wanna get pedantic, like I said, I did it because it was entertaining. 
---
I'd check if it can be configured with the terminal.  Laser tripwires can be.
---
I'll give it a try if I see it. 
---
\+1...  
---
The Rebalance was not handled well and completely wrecked the Demo build.
---
I'm confused, duping relies on rolling back a character after a crash right? What would mass crafting do? 
---
I tried. It only gives the option to turn every switch connected to it on, which turns my decon shower on that I have running from another circuit. 
---
Couldnt it also bump up the level of baddies a low level player is facing with no promise of help if a high level teleports in and pieces out.
---
The fact that my gunslinger used the lvl 5 somerset until lvl 40 shows how powerful and vital the AP is..
---
that right there would be a good move, but i doubt it. as it is they threw in a back burner team that failed to perform. i question why is that?
---
It's not the Responder's Eyebot that is the vendor if that's the one you killed.  
---
All ranged weapons are broken. They all suck compared to melee. The whole system is rediculas as it is. How about stop nerfing and start buffing. Make other weapons stronger. Hell buff the bosses to. Just stop nerfing everything.  
---
That's my guess too
---
Good point. Farcry5 is the first game of the series that i played and only tried it because 76 was having a lot of problems while there was a 60% sale on ubisoft games. So i tried it and am hooked. seeing that new dawn will be a post apocalypse wasteland game in the mountains, i thought it will be bad for bethesda in comparison 
---
Yea, it's recoil is pretty hilarious. I ws running around with about 25 agility and a full 10 rounds was a little under half of my AP. That with concentrated fire made it deal decent damage along with the adrenal mutation.
---
Lol, holy shit.  Link?
---
Basically what I do everytime I long on. Sell to all venders and move camp. When I fast travel to Charleston I always try to spawn the vendor. If someone has built their camp on the small pond there I let them know it's frowned upon, like last night, by destroying the front door, generators, and turrets. I in no way grief people but this spot and Whitesprings Club House are the unspoken rule on where to not build.
---
Because companies in West Virginia (meaning mining companies) generally ARE evil. Reference this Last Week Tonight with John Oliver video. Murray Energy DID sue Oliver, but lost their case.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw6RsUhw1Q8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw6RsUhw1Q8)
---
Except the base armor sets aren't being consistently offered by the vendors. That's the whole point of the thread.
---
Quite possibly. 
---
&gt;There's no way to turn in technical documents I already had prior to getting the collect technical documents quest in the first place as far as I can tell.
---
If you drop them (make sure to bobbinpin the bag first) and then pick them up 1 or 2 at a time it will usually trigger the quest and allow a hand in.
---
No time for important things . Too much nerfing for Bes atm
---
*jingles keys*
---
Got em
---
Is that what you really think is going on?  Everyone that's pointing out all the things wrong with the game is "pretending"?
---
Are you sure that's the intellectual hill you want to die on?
---
ok bye
---
LOL ... I kiled some Legendary albino deathclaw 3\*  98 lvl....... the drop was 25 level 1\* nocturnal wood armour piece...COmmmmon WTF    a 98 dropss some shit loot...   
---
Every single multiplayer game ever released should be considered 'half-finished'. I don't really appreciate this criticism and I've clocked almost 200 hours into the game so far so it feels play-ready to me, as I have definitely had good value for dollars spent.
---
The game may not be great overall (open to taste), but it does have redeeming qualities for many of us. The world is quite expansive. It has varied zones unlike every other Fallout. Those zones have great artistic direction. The environment design is well done. The music is great as usual (love Inon Zur). The crafting is deeper than most vanilla Fallouts. The perk system is unique and consistently rewarding with milestones. The survival components are not really hard, but still tougher and deeper than past Fallouts.
---
These are the main ones that stand out to me.
---
Aside from that, the number of people shitting on the game is impressive. It's clearly not well liked by the masses. Then again, a lot of games aren't well liked by the masses. And the masses are not always very smart. A lot of games catch a ton of shit from excited, angsty gamers who feel entitled to the best possible game they can conceive of every time they spend money. A lot of gamers are straight-up assholes and act like children, and I've seen *plenty* of that from plenty of people dumping on 76. It's possible to level an accurate or important opinion and still be a complete asshat during the delivery, which pretty much makes the opinion a failure. I don't listen to stupid, rude people in real life, not sure why a well-paid game developer would listen to them online.
---
So I think it's fine if you assign value to the reactions of people to 76-- including many who straight-up hate the game yet have never played it. I can't personally put much stock into the viewpoints and frequent overreactions/exaggerations of manchildren who freak out over a video game.
---
The only thing I can really agree with is that yes, Bethesda corporate is greedy. Most game publishers are pretty much greedy I think. But Bethesda has made some bad choices and hopefully they will either dig themselves out of the hole in spite of the people who gloat over every misstep, or they pass on the game to modders before too long. 
---
All that said, I appreciate your civil reply, but I still don't understand why you're so blamey toward Bethesda for the state of the game when it was pretty apparent how it would go down before launch even happened. But hopefully you can find another game to wash away the bad taste. ;)
---
Do we have confirmation anywhere that these work on all scorched creatures and scorch beasts? I've read conflicting things so I'd love some actual data or sources.
---
Going off memory here but I think I remember reading that scorched killer receivers only apply to scorched people, the zealots effect applies to all scorched creatures but not scorch beasts, and the prime receiver applies to everything.
---
Again, I have no idea how true any of this is and would love some solid info from anyone.
---
They accidentally removed the NoAutoScrapJunk \[KYWD:004ECBA8\] keyword from all the Bulk items, super easy fix, so we hope they'll add it back before long.
---
Why bother they would never put anyone that is directly in charge of anything. Likely a PR person that would have to "check with Dev team" about every issue brought up.
---
If we actual did get some high up they would never give you any real answers most vague promises to look into that, "its an option we are look at for a future update" etc.
---
Rather have a detailed road-map about the planned changes, upgrades and DLCs fo76 will be gettting in the next year. But this had better be a meaty bone with real info not just vague promises.
---
Better yet make it Video that includes some gameplay footage.
---
Where's the BEEF??? BETHESDA!!!
---
&gt; Level 248 here on PC. I've experienced more serious bugs like CTDs and frequent SNR maybe once in ten sessions,
---
That's a terrible ratio.
---
I'm constantly thirsty it seems.  Hungry, not so much but I have needed more food lately.  Beginning to think my Speed Demon  mutation negative effect never was cured.  :(

---
You should be able to make it.  It's in advanced power connectors
---
I'm all for pistols being more viable than they are but at the same time I'm not sure that I'd be on board with having them on par with other weapons for the late game.
---
Think about it in the term of real world situations. You don't see special forces, military units, tactical units etc. use pistols as lead weapons. Nor do you really see them used in a specialist capacity either. Shotguns were used in the military and some units for close quarters, heavy weapons like flamers and snipers were military specialists and so on. The only instance I can think of pistols is their use along with a riot shield or as a backup weapon. So expecting them to perform on par with other end-game weapons is questionable.
---
Having said that though (mainly to manage expectations), it doesn't mean to say that there can't be some improvements.
---
There's already an in-game benefit where pistols don't slow you down at all when drawn. Maybe that could be made a little more pronounced by not just improving movement speed (there's already a perk for that, Gunrunner) but maybe reload speed as well.
---
Maybe there could also be an improvement in VATS accuracy at closer range, particularly for non-torso body parts, since the weapon is lighter and less prone to swaying like a heavier weapon might cause. Maybe better VATS crippling too at close range? I'd imagine it'd be easier to be a crackshot and be able to hit something small like someone's eye or limb join at close range compared to a rifle, scoped or otherwise.
---
Btw, I've noticed that a scoped 10mm pistol has no sighted sway on it at all by default. No need for armour mods to achieve that.
---
They could also perhaps allow for duel wielding so you can "stack" legendary effects but have to do away with scope usage and accuracy in the process. That's probably unlikely for a fair while due to likely engine limitations. However, I can see a riot shield be more viable. It's already in the skyrim code (complete with shield bash from memory...?) and it also makes sense from a viability point of view. Your weapon won't hit any harder but you'll be a lot tankier from the front.
---
So there could be some ways for pistols to be around late game but I don't think they should ever be on par with other late game weapons in raw damage output, even allowing for some fictional boost to sell the gunslinger fantasy. However, maybe in niche ways like high mobility, close range accuracy/crit or extra utility like the shield.
---
Ditto.
---
 Problem in my eyes is that all the perks are in AGI, which you want high, but if you spec them you cut other things like sneak damage, action boy, etc. Be great to move one more to perception, maybe a swagger perk in cha, etc. 
---
Never heard of *berry mentats*  have you? Can I see through walls? As a matter of fact I can. But also I am a dev so seeing misplaced particles from being *invisible* stick out like a sore thumb to me but eh.
---
You are so hell bent on proving I am wrong it is really pathetic at this point  *You're wasting oxygen son*
---
Proof?
---
maybe the legendary effects should be active only for pve,
---
turn them off completely for pvp, and balance some of the melee damage for pvp combat, they almost always kill you in one hit .
---
The TSE "Rebalance" needs to be revisited, badly.  
---
Completely wrecked the Demo builds, and Missile Launchers and Fatmen were barely worth it before hand.
---
Isn't that what perk cards are for? Higher levels would have access to more cards so they are better with the same guns.
---
Unless you are talking of against lvl 50+ "low lvl" characters, lower than you at least, which at that point I'd say more relies on whether said weapon was able to be modified more because of crafting perks.
---
Are you saying you think lowly of yourself?  
---
The point is it would be op
---
A revisiting of the TSE "Rebalance" needs to happen
---
Maybe try appealing your ban before throwing insults? I would be pissed to but throwing a tantrum on redit isnt going to help any. 
---
I've had spots where it seemed to produce them about 70% of digs (in the forest) and others only 20% or so (in bog).  I only dug about 10 at each location.
---
Rather than just increase the numbers, I think that heavy explosives should get bonus effects that create a niche for them. Missile launchers and Fatmen (Fatmans?) could do a % of max health, plus a static number. 
---
Maybe 1 or 2% for missiles, and 3-5% for Fatman. (Maybe more maybe less, we'd need some testing to dial in the numbers to feel good without being overpowered.)
---
And the grenade launcher could have a built in tenderizer mechanic. Getting repeatedly exploded certainly would mess up any armor you're sporting. 
---
Additionally, these types of weapons could have a guaranteed "flinch" proc on targets, interrupting and preventing the use of any abilities for 2 or 3 seconds. 
---
It would make them uniquely adept at taking out large targets, while still adding a bit of utility and damage to help with smaller enemies. 
---
I hope a Bethesda Community Manger will respond and clarify this issue.
---
Being polite tends to be a more adult way of handling issues. It's way better than saying REEEEEE at Bethesda and you're being a decent human being. Thanks for being responsible. 
---
Yes, same. Ps4

Maybe you've become so stealthy that you wrap around the other side of invisible to super-visible. Like how Gandhi's stats were so anti-war in Civilization that he just became nuke happy. 
---
Luck of the Draw helps a lot if you have the spare points to max it out. 
---
Powering down Whitesprings
---
Stop complaining and send a ticket dumbyhead 
---
That's exactly what I was thinking.
---
Especially at White Springs. The one time I specifically went to gather phlox I ended up with approximately 25 stable various fluxes. In an hour.
---
Lots of people have been posting similar things, but none are providing evidence. 
---
Which means someone bought the plans off the vendor before you got there. 
---
Vendor inventories are instanced to the server not to the player, they made it easier, but not as easy as getting the Ultracite armor plans is now.
---
And why the downvote?
---
agree to disagree!
---
Sounds like astroturfing to me ;-)
---
If.... if you're being serious, how does disabling barriers not get you banned? Also why is that option a thing? Does it help with anything else?
---
Any plans on adding the ability to change the pip-boy light color? Not a fan of the default green. 
---
Ahhh. Yeah. The gigantic one. Lol it's massive so I opted for the smaller one and assumed they had the same functionality. I'll give it a try. That link is awesome, btw. 
---
I wrote down 1000 emails explaining what i was doing, support tickets and tons of other stuff. Not even answered, i'm really sad about this and i Need to talk and let everyone know that there Is actually a lot of errors in how do they ban.
---
The Broadsider is an explosive weapon, effected by demo expert instead of heavy gunner.
---
However, cannonballs count as ballistic ammo instead of explosive ammo.
---
As an explosive character, am I seriously expected to perk into Bandolier to use an explosive weapon? This makes no sense and I have to believe it's a bug.
---
Why do Cannonballs show up under normal ammo on the tinker's bench instead of explosive ammo when they in fact explode and their parent weapon is explosive?
---
I want to use the broadsider, but it seems utterly broken mechanically and isn't powerful at all.
---
*Finish Him!* and as if to solidify my point you complain your gun doesnt do enough damage but then say you wont use a TS cause of the accuracy penalty which immediately cuts your damage in half, and if you are that worried about accuracy **You dont know how to build your character** *Fatality*
---
I don't blame you at all. From a bugs stand point almost any other game is better than 76 lol. F5 main story was one of the best ubi games ive played. Im a huge fan of watchdogs as well. 
---
All I really want is a wall plaque to put my tse in, maybe a tasteful rip sign to go with it. 
---
I would say guerilla perk has it worse then gunslinger due to lack of weapon and perk choices.
---
Thanks for that!
---
How do you get the vendor bot to spawn i have tried so many times no luck
---
Well we don’t know what they’re for either, and it’s a little bit of jumping to conclusions to say they’re for Pay to Win items. What if lunchboxes are going to be similar to Fallout 4 lunchboxes, or they’re going to be an in-game reward for, say, finishing 5 events, or taking a workshop, or holding 5 workshops at once?
---
Spaghetti... dogs?
---
Deathclaw on a zamboni- I love it!
---
didn't know you could have permanent berry mentats. and you don't need to be a dev to see through stealth boy, the point is making it more difficult for people to see you, not outright impossible.
---
unless you're standing behind a wall or mountain that is. my point. at least you're not trying to prove that melee isn't op anymore. it's an impossible task, so I understand.
---
Bethesda, can I just have a few plastic trees so I can literally farm it?  Went through 200+ plastic because I'm not smart and scrapped all 3 times last night with bulk items in my inventory AFTER I discovered the bug. :(
---
Yeah, and 500 atoms can get you like a bed if that
---
it saves you like 30 caps...I don't think that's op, but appreciate the input :)
---
I can get behind this, I mean PVP should be flat damage all effects disabled... build against build.
---
Now fix perk and explosive damage nerf and maybe some of us will come back to play
---
If you're on PC I'd be happy to make you a handmade rifle
---
Winner winner! Lmao. Forgot to pay bill, all g now
---
Can I have your loot ?
---
We'll see about that! Thanks for the reply
---
I’m talking about level 100, 200, 300. There is nothing to do with perks etc. 
---
I mean yea, it's levity, but is it also condescending and mean? Fun at someone else's expense? It reads a bit that way to me. Some dude unknowingly ended up in your spot with a build you consider inferior so you mock them on the forums and leave poop in their home?
---
Ehhh. Hopefully you didn't intend it the way I'm seeing it. 
---
I'll have to go through my post history, gimme a minute.
---
Also, another guy was threatening to sure because the TSE nerf ruined his build and wasted his time.
---
...IF it’s on sale. 
---
I didn’t notice the damage at first 
---
How ti prove evidence??? I got banned sever hours later when It happened, and the only thing i got in my mind Is that they saw my Halloween costumes CRAFTING as glitching. How Can i get the video of what i was doing? Don't mind if You do not trust me, i was lvl 196 and taking up 500 Rubber and 100 of the other material ti craft some.costumes Is not a problem for me, so why the hell i got banned??? Do not even have never taken up 100% duped items for being scared of ban, why so crafting items took me to a ban?
---
I loved that mod. I miss it when playing 76.
---
too\* sorry
---
Be happy there isn't a legendary Commie Whacker or Protest Sign
---
At least a Rolling Pin can kill stuff
---
Already did, i complain because they do not response to my tickets and emails, that's why i complain on reddit
---
I didn't read all of your post, but I like that you actually have researched or know the profile of the 10mm. It is my favorite caliber, but unfortunately I had to sell my kimber a few years ago. I usually explain the 10mm as having the stopping power of the .45 at the velocity of a 9mm. Obviously it ia slightly smaller than the .45 and has a velocity a little slower than the 9mm, but it is close enough for a quick description. That, and I hate doing math and trying to figure out ballistic trajectories etc. I know what grain I like to fire up to 600 yards. I have a separate grain that I will use for attempting shots up to 1000 yards with my .308, but really I would not attempt a shot for a deer or elk beyond about 500 meters, or about 600 yards just to round up. I used to shoot a .300 win mag, but I really didn't need to destroy a tree to get the elk behind it. Well maybe if it was an aspen I would. I hated those groves and never understood how such large magnificent beasts like bull elk could run through them without getting severely hurt. 
---
I didnt get a notification of rewards when completing the mission. Ofc there could be xp rewarded but not notified.
---
...are you seriously being this cringy?
---
eh, ok. TS is a 25% bonus, not 50. there are better prefixes now. and have you tried shooting a heavy weapon with poor accuracy?
---
I'm gonna say no since you're so blatantly wrong.
---
Killing effects for PvP only would have made a lot of since.
---
I made an AMA suggestion a few weeks ago, and the top comment was similar to this. Help me out? Trying to understand why its a bad idea, what exactly are the risks and what do they have to lose?
---
Trolls? Angry people? Too many questions all over the place? That happens now and has for some time. An AMA, especially one that is recurring, would help clear the air and add some transparency. PR is already so bad it can only get better, not worse - and I'm not even angry, just looking for 2 way comms vs. the 1 way we have now.
---
that's fallout 5
---
How do you know it was from crafting costumes?
---
How many did you craft? I want to craft a shitload of stuff and see if it triggers a ban.
---
Idk why people still play this game.
---
I like the game too, playing it right now over 100 hours in, but it's broken as FUCK and Bethesda seems to screw up everything they touch and take ten steps back for every step forward. There's no denying that.
---
I expect better, I will accept no less for my money, and you bet your ass I will call them out whenever they do some dumb shit. Don't like it, don't read it.
---
Garys

I've created an explosives build to test the viability of it, and I had a blast doing it. With the explosive weight reduction perk, I could carry 100 missiles no sweat, and thousands of grenade launcher rounds. Something to factor in for DPS is how often you miss, and missing is difficult with the grenade launcher due to the blast radius, and impossible with the missile launcher once you get the targeting software. ADS to lock on, fire a salvo of four rockets, then loot the resulting crater. I still had a bit of trouble justifying the fat man, but with the daisy cutter coming in at less than six pounds and ammo weighting 0.6 pounds for me, it made for a fun tool to rain down destruction on a nuke zone or main street Watoga. 
---
Lol.  Yesterday this one guy being me was so impatient that he started shooting me.    I decided to go into the in game menu, then off pacifist mode and shoot back.     
---
Lucky for him, he didn’t have any junk on him.  
---
Vats logic still thinks its two projectiles, don't use vats and they both go "close" to the same spot, use vats and its like having a staring contest with Steve Buchemi
---
I am on Xbox Live and have the following three serum recipes.
---
Herbivore
---
Carnivore
---
Eagle Eyes
---
I have two herbivore serum sitting on me right now. If anybody wants any of these I will give it to you for free if you supply the materials.
---
If you don't have them, I'll make them for 250 each as long as I've got the materials.
---
Yep, clearly it was the Explosives Expert and White Knight perks that need nerfing along with TSEs. Game's perfectly balanced now.
---
I would go as far as remove legendary effects from pvp, you would loose what little build diversity there is. Scaling should defiantly scale independently from pvm.  
---
SP Co-op
---
I have this with the PC the mouse can easily move your the selection even if you are not near it. Always use arrow keys when trading or selling.
---
I'm really dying to understand how this works, because it's critically important to my motivation to continue building on one character. Sometimes I will get 5 levels and it feels like nothing has changed, so then I wonder, will anything change if I keep going? Should I just retire this char and move on to a new one and a new build?
---
I really wish Bethesda would just make the damn budget and item placement cost transparent instead of this useless bar and percentage haha. xD  I've poked one of their CMs here on reddit to ask if they could clarify how building budget works and if it increases, but they never replied. It seems like something that should have been very easy to read from the start.
---
Anyway, if you ever get confirmation of how this works please let me know, and I'll do the same if you're interested.  
---
Have you tried a gamma gun?
---
Game is currently useless. Played all the time before this patch. Signed in today in the am, only time I get to play is around 7am till around 10am. Signed in couldn’t moved but could fast travel. Okay Ill reset. But it happens again. So I reset again. This time I spawn in falling and die, then it freezes on the respawn screen. Okay, I’ll eat breakfast and go at it again. Come back, launch it up, and guess who’s falling through solid mountain yet again. Gave up. Try again tomorrow smh 
---
Halloween costumes use plastic, not rubber 
---
This!
---
I'm not entirely against an increase to build budget but I don't think we should be able to build massive settlements either.
---
I like the idea of the camp being a mobile platform. It's meant to be small. The only problem is that no one really uses it in that fashion. I find constantly that I want to setup a camp in order to do something small like rest or cook or such but not have to worry about rebuilding my home and placing it back where it was.
---
Maybe the solution is to have a H.O.M.E. that can allow for a larger budget but at a much larger cost for moving it around and the C.A.M.P. having a considerably smaller budget than it already has but has no setup cost and, like power armour, disappears back into your inventory or where ever it comes from once you leave its area.
---
Hard to say what you're doing different. I'm on PC, and I'm having fun, but I cannot say it's been bug-free. In addition to disconnects, I've seen: 
---
* Creatures bug out in the ground or in a structure, but you need to kill them for a quest... This happens lots, particularly with taking or defending public workshops. If you don't do that, you might not see this as much. 
---
* Items disappear, including one teammate's whole excavator suit. I think it might have happened because I fast traveled to him as he was logging out, but I don't know. One time I logged in my shotgun was gone and I had a grenade launcher in its place. It doesn't happen often, but that's really impactful in an item-driven game! 
---
* Other players appear in their skivvies, or power-armor top and bare-legs below (not since last patch)
---
* Other players on the team are bugged into invisibility: "Where are you?" "Right beside you." It's really hard to coordinate with invisible teammates
---
* Quest markers don't appear on map (even after hitting 'c' for show location)
---
* Super-mutant faces hover in the air (that's some eerie stuff)
---
* Base turrets all toggle to destroyed, and won't repair, but then toggle back to fixed with a re-log
---
I will say that playing with other people on coms highlights the bugs, because if one of you sees something out-of-sorts, it's a bit clearer when it's a bug. 
---
Beyond the bugs, there's lots of UI complaints that Fallout players are used to fixing with mods, but it's not so clear what mods are kosher in this shared environment. 
---
SEPARATE SERVERS FOR PVE AND PVP.  
---
NO OTHER COMPROMISE.
---
Oh and can you let me know what you level your char is in the video? I'm 55 on my main so I'm curious if you're higher than me, it seems like you've got more decor placed overall but my main's camp is also much more of an interior detail build.
---
Pigs won't take a bullet to save a human.......
---
Might be a rando drop for that, then, as I did it as well and didn't get it there.
---
Thank you for being a kind deliverer of excess plans, regardless of whether I got it or not!
---
Exactly
---
Raleigh clay bunker jtluk
---
I sincerely appreciate it.
---
I think Is for that, because i Readed up that some people got banned for this, and this Is the only thing i could have done, because i remember that 1 day before the ban i did like 200 Halloween costumes to take em a part, i got this costume Plan 2 days before doing this, and i was so Happy see this could Be sold for 63 Caps each
---
I'm not sure if camping there actually stops the vendor from spawning. The time I actually found the long coat there was someones CAMP right next to him. I was pissed when I loaded in, decided to try to get him to soawn and he did. Not sure if everyone is just repeating what they read on here or if theres truth to it but I know he can spawn there even if a camp is nearby. 
---
I think they'll stay exactly as they are, as Bethesda's best move financially is to abandon this game ASAP.
---
I mean exactly how are the suppose to provide evidence?  I question the accounts here in accuracy, but how should they prove it.  BTW none of the dupers (if you believe there account) got banned for duped, it was all related users reporting them from what they said.  The ones that created an account to sale from are all good.
---
Every answer will just be: “We’ll pass it alone to the team.”
---
Attacking Bethesda does not help the Fallout Community
---
Now you know 😁, and know is half the battle!
---
Thank you! Not to mention how I can get server disconnected at any moment INCLUDING during events. Why should anyone risk the trip like that? If the event is near me then maybe it's worth it. Otherwise you're basically gambling.
---
Complaining that you don't like a game you enjoyed for 100+ hours does not help the fallout community. We were promised infinite upgrades, literally "we will never abandon this game". Nothing bethesda has done contradicts this. I personally have found over 2 dozen unopenable doors waiting for new content. That content is coming. Maybe next month maybe next year. This game is 2 and 1/2 months old. You played and enjoyed it for at least 40 hours. So go play rdr2 or whatever else you like and then come back to Fo76 when there is more to enjoy.
---
Flower armor. Im pretty proud of that. 
---
(Cause i use it to pick flowers lol)
---
WoW’s game director tried that and it went pretty terribly.
---
even outside vats it's absolutely terrible. I've seen projectiles fly 90 degrees off. that's absurd considering the nerf.
---
That’s a very nice offer, but I’m PS4
---
but even in a separate pvp server, someone with legendary weapons will always have an advantage, there is not much balance 
---
**Issues with daily quests:**
---
There is a pretty major issue with daily quests and progression. If you get disconnected from the server or log out, you lose all progression on daily quests, no longer have access to the quest in your log, and cannot simply go back to the same location and acquire the quest again. 
---
One recent example was on a quest called Vox something. Essentially, the player needed to collect data by shooting 3 different and specific animals with a Vox syringer and return with the data. First off, it can be difficult to find the three specific animals, so my first 30 minutes was spent searching for one and finding two of the other animals instead. I was on my way to find the third in a new location when a Scorchbeast attacked near Whitesprings. With help from the bots, I was able to kill the Scorchbeast, only for the server to disconnect and upon logging back in, the quest was simply gone. 
---
This has happened a few other times, another one trying to bury some civil war remains. I got to the end of the quest, placed the remains and needed a shovel. There was supposed to be a shovel next to the grave, but someone had already taken it earlier apparently. I travel around searching for a shovel with no luck and eventually get disconnected by the server. Log back in and the quest is gone, along with my progress. 
---
Quests should remain in your log if you get disconnected. Period. 
---
Quests should also retain your current progress. Period. 
---
On a separate note, thank you for posting this thread and I really hope to see continued improvement through the game's life. Below are some general comments because I have a bit of free time and just want to express these thoughts in an updated feedback thread: 
---
**Scorchbeast mechanics:**
---
I really hope the Scorchbeast mechanics are adjusted. I fought on a couple days ago with a friend and their mechanics can only be described as broken. I was running around in power armor while this thing CONSTANTLY fired it's sonic boom attack. If I wasn't moving around, I would expect the attack to go on indefinitely. In a 10 second period, the beast likely shot 12 sonic booms with 100% accuracy, completely blinds you to their whereabouts, and the player does little to no damage, only able to get realistic damage when it lands which is once in a 20 minute fight. In the end, the loot is incredibly underwhelming after you go through that much ammo and stimpacks. I have video if you'd like to see the "battle."
---
**Perk Cards and swapping:**
---
Issues with perks and swapping out cards due to the severely limited number of perk points. Possible to make some types of perk card passive rather than take up SPECIAL slots? Lock pick, hacker, some weight reduction perks, etc. Players are still working hard for their levels and get stuck with either constantly swapping cards or limiting their build potential. I currently have far too many weight reduction cards applied to customize my build in a meaningful way. I also cannot sell the excess items I acquire through my travels because there are so few options for selling items. Why would I want to drop everything I've collected instead of sell it and then turn around, back into the wastes and collect the same stuff again? 
---
**Resources and limited investment opportunities:**
---
Coming off the last topic, along with vendors needing more caps to offload excess equipment, aid, and junk, Workshops need to be improved and turned into investment opportunities for players and their extra scrap. In Fallout 4, whenever you claimed a new workshop, their inventories were essentially empty and it was up to the player to invest their collected materials into the base. Players could build what they wanted to fortify or beautify the workshop and the progress would be saved. There is currently very little incentive to claim workshops at the moment.
---
Around the time the game came out, I claimed a few workshops, built them up, and as I neared the time for a defense to take place, I was disconnected from the server and lost all progress on that workshop. Today, I don't want to have anything to do with workshops no matter how much I want to build up a base on one and join those activities. When nothing is saved and you are constantly disconnected and lose progress, I am not having a good time. 
---
[A month ago I wrote up this post about re-working workshops](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3f1tm/i_think_im_done_with_workshops_until_they_get_a/). I am sharing again in the feedback thread with hopes you'll take a look and think about their current state of development. 
---
**CAMP building restrictions:**
---
If we ever get improvements to workshops, or even if we're limited to our small camps, there are too many restrictions when building. Things like:
---
- Cannot delete item because part of the base will not be accessible
---
- Cannot place item, needs support (even though the object is clearing inside the ground or on top of another piece)
---
- Item intersects with another object in ways that don't seem correct
---
- Restrictions on placing objects or attaching certain objects to others. One example is that I could not place a half wall at the underside of the upper shed roof eave to create a split gable type of roof. There are also no options that I could tell to actually create clerestory windows in a half wall system. I had to circumvent this by placing a small gable roof, place the wall, delete the roof and replace the shed roof piece. 
---
- Restrictions on building budget. They're just small. If you expand on the CAMP and start allowing us to place "junk" or "Aid" items for decorations (which I really hope you do), this will need to expanded upon beyond what is already needed in terms of limited budget. 
---
- Not being able to place "Second story" floors next to foundation or "first story" floors is incredibly limiting for interesting buildings and developing more difficult terrain. 
---
- Note that a "flatten" terrain tool would be a welcome and very interesting tool.
---
- Can we also have the ability to actually bulldoze environmental scrap including wisps of grass that like to protrude through foundation floors?
---
**Power armor:**
---
Power armor needs some attention. First off, allowing us to rename frames and other equipment would be a great step in the right direction. However, we also need a way to better manage multiple frames and swapping pieces. I recently went out and found a few level 50 pieces for a couple different Power armor sets and had to constantly place the frames to swap out the parts. After a couple minutes, they would drop back into my inventory and I would have to place them again in order to keep swapping and examining different parts between the different sets. 
---
I've also run into a bug with trying to manage my power armor sets and have had parts go missing off my raider set of armor. I also have some video of this if you'd like to see and I've been meaning to fully assemble the video to report the bug. 
---
Naming sets is the first step in this process and being able to "display" the sets in power armor stations would be the ultimate situation. I'd love to be able to create a space in my camp with a few power armor stations in a garage of sorts, and walk down the stairs to the displayed armor sets, pick one out, jump in and head off into the wastes. With them displayed in a more permanent manner, they would also be more accessible to work on. I did the same thing in Fallout 4 with different sets placed in my house and easy to take off and swap different parts and pieces. 
---
**Teams:**
---
There also appears to be a bug floating around with joining teams. I've noticed on a few occasions that I could not join a friend's team without re logging or completely reloading the game. In one example, I sent a team invite to a friend who just logged on and he was busy fighting a Deathclaw so he couldn't stop to accept the invite. After he finished, I left the team I joined by inviting him and tried to invite again, but he wasn't able to accept the request or even see that I sent a request. 
---
Another example was with a random player I met. I needed to drop some extra scrap and came across a level 3 guy and gave him some bulk materials I had in excess. He invited me to a team, but I wasn't sure how long I was going to be playing. I ended up doing a nearby event and he followed and decided I would invite him to a team and take a workshop just for something fun to do. I couldn't invite him because he was apparently already part of a team that he created when he initially invited me, but I had declined. I finally got the word to him that I wanted to team up and I eventually got an invite out that didn't come back with the error, but he couldn't join. We shared the confused emote and eventually went our separate ways. 
---
It’s a shame really they should listen to us
---
**In-game bug reporting and commenting:**
---
I think something that could be of huge benefit to the development and communication team for this game would be an in-game bug/comment reporting system. If players had the ability to report bugs within the game itself or make comments about potential improvements, this information could be gathered and be incredibly useful for development. Fortnite has a system in place where players can comment or report bugs within the game environment which is quick and easy, provides useful coding information, and allows players to report stuff as they happen rather than trying to remember hours later like I am today. 
---
**Rambling:**
---
I could go on, but I have already gone on long enough. There are more ideas that could really help the game and it's development and I hope your team evaluates everything that is getting discussed to improve upon the game. I understand there are some more important bugs to tackle first, but these other issues will also need some attention before too long or players will continue to leave the game and may not return. We already saw a lot of backlash after the last round of patches. *(Do I need to mention the White Knight nerf and how you attacked the remedy rather than addressing the cause?)
---
Once I get a chance, I'll be posting a couple of the videos I mentioned in the post above to demonstrate some of the issues I've encountered and would be interested in a reaction. 
---
Thanks for reading and sorry for the drawn out post. This is truly one of the only few outlets to express concern with hope of making improvements to the game. 
---
It should be 100% and they should balance PvP separately like Destiny. 
---
I like it! I take alot of pictures and would be nice to display them. 
---
It's as if this game is being managed by a bunch of incompetent morons. 
---
Oh wait 
---
Yeah, there really hasn't been enough discussion about the AI. It's brilliant one moment and then completely bugged and mindless (or frozen) the next. There's too many other things that need fixing first, but the balance would be even worse if the AI wasn't so frequently mindless. 
---
Ui. Thanks for the Tip
---
There's a dead one in the back of a garbage truck on a main road in the Ash Heap.
---
Also, the Flatwoods Monster is a Zetan.
---
We gonna get a qwertz optimization anytime soon too?
---
It works fine for us on Ps4 but I wish u luck man. I can understand that such things are really frustraing
---
I actually haven’t. Have you tried it with any luck?
---
This is the first game where I’ve given up on using a .50 Cal rifle. 
---
I rushed so hard and fast into the game where I never considered if they’d unbalanced the damn thing but it being tied to the .308 rifle as an ammo kid should have been my first clue. 
---
The lever action rifle does a similar amount of damage but without the extremely slow reload speed on every shot. 
---
They need a "flower power" Power Armor paint now. Ty dye colors, and maybe some smoke coming out the helmet? 
---
So what you're saying is, you want to give your credit card to Bethesda for some American Patriot paint before the Superbowl right ?
---
I couldn't agree more, would love to know more in depth. I wish every game studio could be more like Rare. How active they are with the Sea of Thieves community is what I'd like to see from every studio.
---
&gt; Game design just has so little thought into it.
---
Honestly, this has *always* been a problem with Bethesda's games, it's just that it's easier to tolerate in a single-player game, even outside of the fact that multi-player games usually get more balance patches or the fact that you could mod previous games to fix the parts you didn't like.
---
Hey now, let's leave a little room for hyperbole. This is the internet after-all. 
---
Same for me too 
---
I just want current turrets to be more responsive. It seems that enemies have to be on top of them and firing at them before the turrets response.
---
I actually find it to be the happy medium of DPS/ROF/range between the minigun and Gatling gun. A good mainline heavy gun, especially since I just picked up one with armor penetration.
---
I'd recommend fully investing into heavy weapons and taking the .50 for a spin again. Keeping up on ammo is a little tough but it's the only gun I need in most encounters.
---
anyway i cannot even Remember the right materials because i had no time to craft more.
---
And trust me that i was having like 20.000 Caps, and buy plastic or farm It, for me, that actually used to play the game for 6/8 hours per day was not hard to get.
---
Try to create a new account and create hundreds of items, i want to do this try to see if actually Is an automatic ban.
---
One of my friends already got the calibrated shocks plan.

Hmm I agree on some points, I but I feel or at least I think most of the regular gamers/ fallout players who like fo but who dislike the thought of a fo online experience, got turned off by the game when all the glitches and bugs were in your face a few weeks before the global launch and thought twice about buying into this experience
---
 I'm also guessing most bought the game and dropped it when they realized it was not worth the time 
---
And because of that when you claim that *most* of the players who are still hanging on to fo 76 and enjoy the content and will continue to enjoy it, my belief it is because *the majority* of the fan base does not and have moved on from another division/destiny/ rushed ass game that they've seen before and are waiting a year of content/patches to come out before returning and the few legitimate players that continue  to speak out and complain about on going changes and problems they don't like and get traction is because they've stuck to it (and no I'm not talking about fake posts and bs like that) and I feel should be listened instead of being told they are cry babies and saying something along the lines of "they're just haters and are the cause of this drought of content"  which doesn't open a discussion with them and instead rules out their points without a valid argument and further and is toxic and make this look more and more like  if Titanic had an echo chamber chat room before it split in half
---
Your main point is, "this is not a game for tryhards, it's for casuals and they have to cater to the casuals to make money, simple" my belief is if you don't cater to tryhards and only cater to casuals then you will get casual sales and make casual money, the problem with that  is 76 was made of consoles/PC and not released as a  mobile game where it could be heavy on the MTXs to make up for the fact it doesn't have large following and rely on people to turn into a whales for short bursts of gameplay and on console and pc you have a ton of amazing games and personally FO76 is very niche, unless we have hard in game stats about the player base on day1-day7 then compare its player stats a week before a patch and after for every patch, I won't believe that it's a profitable game that has a future, from the little I hear about announcements made by the devs, it looks like it's on life support already, I haven't heard a ripple of new major story content, nothing for wary players that love the fo world but want to enjoy themselves in fallout experience but with the option to do co op and because of the lack of plan for content I personally don't see a reason to return, they're just not selling me the supposed bright future of this game, trust can only go so far when it comes to a corporate entity and mines at an all time low when it comes to the FO franchise, especially after FO4
---
Lol maybe on your ps4. I’m glad to hear that but I’m on ps4
---
That's fine. 
---
Interesting on that last point. I ask, are there any references to the feuding Hatfield and McCoy families in the game? I'm at a loss to think of why they wouldn't be referenced in the game somewhere. I wonder if perhaps they might be included in a future DLC. Maybe one with factional PVP? If there's ONE THING in WV state history that most out-of-staters know about it's the Hatfields &amp; McCoys feud.
---
Let's see, to avoid getting sued, they could call the two families something like the Hertzfelds and the McCory's (I renamed my original idea for the first family to something worse in order to leave Bethesda open to use that idea without worry of me trying to extract money from them). Maybe a third faction, state police or some kind of federal Dept of Energy equivalent or the agency that took over the uranium mine in Uranium Fever? Trying to stop both factions from causing problems for the mining industry. Like other factions in the game, their robots (and terminals) would continue hiring on local helpers/fighters long after the original members of those factions were all killed off by the Scorched/Scorchbeasts.
---
The ruined it. They vastly overestimated the amount of people being negatively affected by TSE's and instead punished everyone who was just minding their own business. 
---
I'm actually putting this claim to the test, I've recorded every single step. Waiting to see the results. I posted about it here, and my post got deleted asap.... which I also took a SS of.
---
Worst Fix ever.
---
facts me too i kinda hate the fact that you have to spend a whole week for ONE legendary item which is pretty useless in the end
---
There's an interesting concept in UX design based on how our eyes see things, and the overall report is that shape/shading is seen before colouring. A good UI should be decipherable in completely greyscale.
---
Thaaannk you for this. Totally unaware of stuff like this. Now I just have to figure out where those areas are. 
---
They really should all of are mods are the absolute hardest to get.
---
Top of the monorail elevator. 10 bags I believe.
---
Watoga station vendor has had dense mod for combat armor and the plan for the marine dense chest I have yet to see the plan for the combat dense just the mod
---
Curious does the excavator have a rocketpack?
---
I dont plan on getting it just curious. My current one is set for max carry wt for fast-traveling.
---
Should make a sabot for the missile launcher. 1 harpoon, 20lb+ pound weight, and oil. Would be fun.
---
A two shot guided missile will fire two missiles inside each other and be guided, you can actually see the two missiles if you turn real fast when firing it will split them up. Though my two shot only does 1 damage more than my regular missile launcher.
---
I rarely go to you tube, except to watch izzy swan's crazy inventions. One day I will attempt a few of them. Well for shop work, gaming is a different story. I bought a kreg tool and when I registered it, it gave me access to hundreds of plans, and then I did the same with my ryobi battery tools so I get a monthly email from them that usually has some plans. I print off the ones I like and put them in a binder for later use. Sometimes I modify from original due to what I have available, or if I am trying to put in a space that is smaller than what the plans build. I am great at modifying plans, I just suck at trying to draw them out. 
---
Just a random tip:   
---
with white knight 3 you only need 2 fibers per armor piece.  Add in "fix it good" to repair armor to 200% so you need to repair less often.  All told you will no longer see ballistic fiber as any sort of limiting factor.
---
Wish I could’ve hopped on to help too, I freaking love killing SBs. A little Endangerol and about 100 rounds from my .50 Cal usually does the trick. 
---
thx man..definitely..its almost embarassing how many hours i played lol..i loved it..i like grinding..whitesprings was so much fun..its too bad bethesda had to basically give us the middle finger..i really really liked this game too..my backlog is ridiculous anyway..guess ill start dabbling into that
---
I've seen the idea floated around a lot of having teo seperate types of systems one for a more permanent location and one for a mobile camp and Im not opposed but I think first steps should be increasing camp budget. 
---
The argument that players arent using camp as a mobile base as its intended doesn't really hold water in my opinion. If it was meant to strictly be a mobile base we would have only been given different size tents and not the ability to build brick walls, place fish lamps, welcome home signs, etc. 
---
I think bethesda understands players want more permanent type bases which is why a lot.of the items in the game exists. We just need a little bump in budget with the release of new items etc, so I don't have to dismantle the core parts of my base I already have just to plave a sign or planter. 
---
Wow....just wow. That roughly 7 hours of game play a day since launch. 
---
We the council of Reddit elders accept your resignation. The only thing is, you can't come back and tell us how terrible the game is, if you aren't actually playing it. 
---
Really? That’s the part you focused on?
---
It's a dick move cause I don't think destroying their camp makes it any more likely that the bot would spawn.
---
Rather than being a dick to that person, they can deal with the real problem and constantly put pressure of Bethesda to fix the issue so the bot can spawn regardless of where you place your camp. Maybe even have the bot spawn in a protected in-game area where you can't build a camp so it's a non-issue and probably easy to fix.
---
I didn’t check which sub this post was in so the entire time I thought this was some hyper meta /r/outside post about trump and nukes 
---
And there answers to the other 10% would be, "We're aware of the issue and are looking into it," or, "That's a great idea thanks for the feedback."
---
Sorry for not wanting to join “Bethesda is made out of evil aliens rather than hard working regular people trying to do their job” hate circle-jerk cult cult.

I hope you find your little self-affirming in-group satisfying.

You can make better turrets with a perk, Home Defense, in agility. You can make heavy machine gun turrets, rocket launchers, laser turrets &lt;think science is needed as well for this&gt;.

Regarding animal taming and player vending, i made a post a while back suggesting ideas to really flesh those features out. It was a bit long and detailed, but heres a link to the OP if you'd kindly have a look see.

Not that I was aware of, but now I get it, as above. ty. 
---
Not recently as my PvP days are largely behind me, but early in the game I did smoke a player with one that was being.............extra. Large blast radius and more importantly it kinda nullifies auto-stim armor since you have the rads to deal with, give it a shot and see how it works. Can't hurt.
---
It is indeed quite comical to read what the patch changed. Below is an excerpt:

Like how the hell did they not see this coming?
---
I'm usually not a complainer, but this time was really enough, never glitched in any game, never exploited, Just played as my best, and this Is the result... Really pissed off.
---
I've noticed my knife speed if faster in Power Armor at least it seems like it, not sure why really. I love knives close up, I think also if I spam W and stay right up against single enemies they can't hit, inside there attack radius? Scorchbeasts once grounded with shotgun and Enforcer perk seem to be unclipped and I end up inside them swinging like crazy doing good damage, really funny. Not sure what other player are seeing.
---
I've always said petrol bombs are best in the hands of heavy drinkers.
---
Oh idk are you being typical premadonna using words like cringy? Omg that's so cringe! 😪 Every one knows heavy guns are shit in this game. But considering you are giving some insight (*finally*) to your trash build it is all making sense now 😂 careful now don't *cringe* I would hate to now I hit you right in the *feels* 😭😪
---
Great info.  Right up the ally with your post about MOD creators helping Bethesda solve their issues.  
---
Fingers crossed that they take notice.
---
I crashed my game when my glitched-out Tesla Gun fired and detonated EVERY. SINGLE. CAR. at the Garrahan Mining complex. It arced through every car and cascaded causing every car to explode at once. For my buddy who didn't get booted, it was AWESOME to see. For me...not so much.
---
&gt;As well there seems to be an "invisible ledge" that you land on as you start coming down from a large jump, this could be removed.
---
I was wondering why I was making that "grunt" and jerk my hands around thing every time I jumped last night.
---
It's not specific to fast travelling. I've seen it just by walking into some areas. Like I'd be able to maybe kill off one or two but then you hear the rest die around you on their own.
---
Random Mass Perma-Bans: For when people aren't abandoning you garbagefire of a game fast enough!
---
Peter Hines isn't MIA by accident, it's a PR tactic to keep a low profile.
---
There are few things that Bethesda did that in most countries are illegal or outright criminal (e.g. the Christmas fake sale), talking about it could get them even in further trouble. 
---
On the same note, a law firm are moving a class action against them *exclusively* for California consumers, since the agreement you take for their service unable any possibility of class actions in most US states (something related to mandatory extrajudicial dispute resolution). 
---
Aside all of this, the AMA would probably turn into a hate train.
---
There's at least one cat and one dog in the game. I don't want to say where because it was really awesome stumbling upon them randomly. I'd highly recommend limiting fast travel so you can explore instead.
---
Would like to add regarding vendor caps. Let’s do 1400 (7*200) for each faction and reset weekly. That helps a lot for the casual players. Instead of doing the vendor cap run daily they can have their time to do it in a week. 
---
Stash:
---
Only non-junk items count towards those 600 or 400lb since mostly armors and weapons are unique and would impact server. 
---
Junk items scraps basically just a string of numbers, should not go heavy on servers performance. And hopefully you can hoard maximum number of maybe 500 -1000 for each stack?
---
The shot gun perks don't apply to the m79 anymore.

Top of the monorail, at the foot of the monorail, outside the lucky hole mine, around the corner from Harpers Ferry behind the chem station. Also if you're on Xbox I have a ton. 
---
I heard Gatling fire rate is crazy now, maybe something to work with there. My approach is low health melee with a bloody explosive shotgun. Shotgun still one shots, melee for queen. Who knows if that's on the overkill nerf list though. 
---
Black Water Mine. Uranium Fever area 3 bags. 
---
I would love to hear from the devs regarding why they believe 4% cripple chance on the Modern Renegade perk is acceptable.
---
BF for Ballistic fiber. Probably kevlar IRL. But fallout sometimes is intentionally unrealistic. Fiber glass is different resource.
---
The Lynch mob would show up pretty quick. I'd be stoked for an event like this though!
---
Thank you for the advice. :) 
---
My 10mm has a bunch of upgrades and I love it and it feels the love and thus reciprocates the love in the form of hella kills how dare you slut shame my pistols it’s 2014.
---
I think there’s several bags at Harper’s ferry too. Might be fertilizer bags. Can’t remember for sure. But I think it’s cement. Near the chem station near the vendor. 
---
I've got an AMA for them, What the fuck have you guys been smoking?
---
You’re a super sledge
---
Sigh,  crashing is still happening.  Lag seems worse in general.  
---
Marine Dense Mod at Harper’s Ferry Bot. Random
---
Agreed, op’s request is silly. 
---
Some TSEs are still viable. Something like a pistol isn't. My double barrel shotgun was still able to one-shot most enemies at 415 damage. 
---
Kept enough perk cards left over to switch to a melee build anyway. Why use a gun at close range if you can hit it harder? 
---
I also know that a TSE Gauss can also still one-shot. Hope this helps and maybe you only need to tweak a few things.
---
Overall I think this change was good. It's great to one-hit trash enemies, but you can't make every enemy a trash mob because then what's the point?
---
Will do!
---
It's basically everything East of the Forest (green area on the map you start in).  Forest is generally save, and you usually don't have much beyond level 10, regardless of player level.  You might get the occasional level 16-18 "boss" type or something.
---
Ash Heap is the mining themed area to the south, and is a mid-level area.  I think it peaks around level 40.
---
Toxic Valley is the grey-ish toxic area to the north, and is a little lower average level than Ash Heap.
---
Once you head East past the mountains, that is the Savage Divide.  Beyond that is the Mire, and Cranberry Bog is to the South of the Mire.  Those three areas are much higher level, and have potentially very high level monsters.
---
Well I don't think they're gonna make it easier. But who knows?
---
I don't have to prove what I know. You on the other hand only insist on talking in circles so why waste my time? Oh that's right because you are so adamant you are right! Now if only you put 1/4 of that energy into actually providing proof to prove me wrong.
---
At first I thought it was just Dupers complaining/lying... which still might be the case, But there are so many of these stories popping up since patch5/hotfix. Also interested to know why I'm getting my posts deleted covering how I'm testing this exact issue and recording everything with a few other players. May I ask, how many did you craft?
---
This might be an agreeable medium if they can get the game in a state where you actually trust that all 50 perk cards are working.

Some on the bottom shelf of the BOS vendor at Watoga.

*I even occasionally join an Event to find it's not even in progress when I get there.*

Yep - happened to me last night. Travelled to the event. No event in progress but the event marker was still on the map.
---
In general both need a buff
---
I doubt this will yield a result as iirc weapon degradation only occurs when you deal damage.  So shooting into the sky should cause 0 degradation.  
---
That said if you do indeed see degradation without dealing damage that would explain a lot.
---
I have been disconnected maybe 6 times in over 200 hours. I play solo on Xbox1 I can run away from a dozen scorched and 3 scorch beasts and not lag.

So you have a chameleon suit of PA?

please tell me you're joking.

---
google that word. exactly as you typed. the top definition on urbandictionary is my reply to you.
---
From what I understand, mass crafting done fast enough is used to crash the server. Just what I’ve kinda deduced from multiple Reddit posts, so it could be incorrect. 
---
I too wanted this when I was playing. Its a small thing, but I hope they adjust this before I come back to the game.
---
Wait...wut?? I thought all clothing was worth 1 cap. Are golf outfits a thing? 
---
Is it?  I remember getting the plan and building one.  It said a very nice rate in the 200's I think.  Then when I fired it it was slow as hell.
---
Rock on my dude
---
yes, because gamers online are extremely well known for being mature and intelligent when it comes to discussion. I'm sure all questions will be well thought out, sensible and not filled with rage and insults.
---
Believe the Abandoned Bog Town building that you access from the roof has some as well. The top floor has all the fans and typewriters. The next floor down has cement. 
---
Ok, great. Well as long as you are satisfied I guess there's no reason to try and improve it for other people then.
---
No problem. Also, consider nuka grenades (not the quantums). Sentinel works if they're standing still, so while they very well may have dense+fireproof on, odds are they aren't rocking heavy rad resistance. The non-quantums do heavy rad damage and force them to move, thus opening a damage window for you. Plus, if they have marsupial and jump away from the grenade you can follow the jump arc and tag them with the gamma gun. All theory of course.
---
Happy hunting.
---
&gt;We shouldn't have fast travel at all.
---
For fucks sake don't give them more ideas to screw over enjoying the game.
---
Cannonballs are not affected by the Ordinance Express perk.
---
They explode and their parent weapon is explosive. This makes no sense and makes the already underwhelming Broadsider utterly useless.
---
I haven't tried that but I have tried moving my camp many times just the normal way by like paying for it. At this point I'll try anything, it can't get any worst then it already is i guess. 
---
I'm saying that I recognize a narcissist when I see one. They generally think quite highly of themselves, and look down upon others. I prefer to fall somewhere in the middle personally. 
---
Everyone will either ask loaded questions or questions they can't answer.  
---
Result being that the AMA does nothing to make them look good and a whole lot to make them look bad.
---
&gt;then the problem is in your game play and perk setup
---
Which is kind of the point? This is/was supposed to be Fallout. I haven’t played this game any different than I ever played previous titles. I’ve never specced straight into specific weapons because I’ve never wanted to. This game requires you to build specific ways because it was never balanced properly. They threw in most of the effects and weapons from 4 with very slight adjustments and didn’t really test them. I’ve always built myself into strength because I’m a hoarder. I carry a wide set of weapons so I can use whatever feels more fun at that point in time but without being specced into dealing damage with guns I simply can’t do much which was never really an issue of mine in 4
---
Brahminlanche!
---
Maybe just maybe they have tons of other people also submiting tickets
---
I don’t necessarily doubt that you were banned, I just doubt the reasoning. If accurate, everybody needs details and proof—ideally screenshots of communication with Bethesda that explains the reasoning for the ban.
---
Looking at your profile I can see that you’ve done a lot of trading. Nothing wrong with that, but you probably acquired duped items/caps in the process. That’s a more likely reason for a ban than crafting. 
---
If you had tons of items in your inventory when trading, you also might have been reported as a duper by someone who traded with you. Maybe they were wrong, maybe not—I’m assuming nothing. 
---
As slow as Bethesda has been to act on any number of things, it’s unlikely that you got a ban for something within hours of doing it. 
---
Indubitably 
---
Oh buddy, you have no idea. One fully restocked golf club is 250 caps with the merchant perk and 4 cha
---
Melee and unarmed are OP in comparison to ranged weapons, but the problem is that ranged weapons need to be buffed to cut out the bullet sponge problem in PVE.
---
Where are you building your camp? Move it to a safer zone/location.
---
Pistols are part of the reasons I want shields added.  More defence from shields + single handed weapons seems like a good balance option.
---
I gotcha, thanks for the perspective. Can't speak for you per se, but I'll guess we both want the game to succeed. I also think legal minefields can be avoided by redlining them straight away. And I think most people are focused on the right now and future, less so about past issues - although that would certainly come up, hence the redlining. The advantage to an AMA is they can choose what to answer. That guy trolling? Ignore. That lady having a tantrum? Skip. That would be a lot of ignoring and skipping, leaving their energies to address the rationale people.
---
Yes... and it seems to randomly drop after fast travelling or getting in/out of power armor.
---
I only use antibiotics. If I’m out and have a disease and only a disease cure I save it until I can craft the antibiotics.  I usually don’t run out. I think it’s well worth the perk points as I have low endurance so am constantly getting diseases.
---
&gt; The argument that players arent using camp as a mobile base as its intended doesn't really hold water in my opinion. If it was meant to strictly be a mobile base we would have only been given different size tents and not the ability to build brick walls, place fish lamps, welcome home signs, etc. 
---
All you need to do is look at all the trailers to see the intent Bethesda had in terms of camp usage. They're all pretty small, open and very temporary looking setups. Not multi-storey mansions with a hobby farm.
---
You're just cherry picking things to suit your argument. You do realise the M in C.A.M.P. stands for mobile, right?
---
My TSE 10mm pistol was a really nice utility gun. It did like 160 damage. I've used it ever since I got it at level 45 and It's my go-to. I'm level 70, It one shotted enemies up to like level 20, then 2-3 up to 40.  I used it to soften up stuff I'm too far away to shotgun. It never felt OP. Now it's an absolute toy.  
---
The idea has been brought up and we indicated via the bethesdagamestudios_ account that we can look into that, whether as a live stream, in the subreddit etc.
---
This would be great! 
---
As you level up, so should your build.
---
Are grabbing the rifleman perks? All three of them and maxing them out? Are you grabbing Sneak for extra damage? Are you using crits? Are you grabbing crit related perks?
---
you want me to prove to you that sun is hot as well? melee output 17k on a poorly optimized build. this has been recorded. now either you think a weapon doing 17k damage per swing is perfectly balanced or I just proved to you they're op.

On top of that huge bridge by flatwoods. There is flipped over truck with spilled toxix waste barrels. Behind it should be 4 bags

If you really want to try your luck then when I next hop on I’ll give you my direct build set so you can tell me how much damage you start dealing with it
---
Promise? Unsub if you could as well. 
---
I received my atoms shortly after the email. 
---
I know it's meant to be multiplayer I am in PS4 and no one I know is playing this game, so I am at it solo but sometimes it's just impossible!
---
they should be disabled in pvp servers, yes.
---
before nerf i had a tse 10mm, i used it mainly in low level areas to clear low lvl mobs to save ammo for the normal guns i used. I got to using it in nuke zones even prepatch that explosive caused me to tag everything but being a 10mm it did so lil damage it never really hurt the lvl 68 glowing ones..  
---
i seen/heard quite a few players freak out when they would see or hear the explosive rounds  and start trying to kill everything before big bad tse shotgun guy killed everything then realizing im over here with a pea shooter.
---
It has been in previous games, yes. That does hold true. But it wasn't nearly as easy to obtain them as it is in this game. In this game, they have mutants running around with missile launchers firing them like crazy for no reason. 
---
Also no, I'm not bitter because someone destroyed my base with them. I'm bitter because it makes no damn sense why there would be so many explosives in this game. In a single player game, sure, makes perfect sense because anything is possible but this isn't online game. Everyone running around with explosive weapons blasting things is just silly. That's the kind of game you want? Low effort big explosions ? Lol
---
I usually see about 1 every other day.
---
Even maxed perks takes a whole clip, sometimes two to take a mutant down. 
---
Looking for a change to the game not a work around.
---
Yeah there stupid reasoning of balancing the weapons..when they made it worse..they are gonna add the fun toys for us only to take that away..terrible terrible mistake bethesda..u hit rock-bottom
---
Great idea!
---
Camp is in the middle bear Helvetia but I spawned near the Pumpkin house. I think I just got some bad luck!
---
Then whats the point in farming out loot? Most of the game just disappears....
---
PC player, level 104, had the game since beta. I have experienced so many CTD's, SBQ despawns, Game freezes, server disconnects in the middle of silo runs, death during loading screens, dying + server crash so you lose all your loot, server destabilizations, carry weight restrictions, and exploiters, constant unfixed bugs AND EVEN THE PATCHES are killing the game for me. I haven't logged in in over two weeks and probably wont until a massive fix is released. 
---
Personally ill be ok with it, Ive done most everything ive set out to do in this game. I just feel bad for the people that will be still playing. Idk if they are trying to go Dark Souls with this game, so many mixed actions taken. 
---
So coop
---
Wait... I'm so confused.  Scrapping bulk from inventory to craft/repair but NOT when using "Scrap All" is how it worked until just a few days ago.
---
I'm glad that you intend to fix it but don't be fake news saying this was not a bug and really wasn't a feature before.
---
Bingo, I've had to wait up to 10 seconds
---
If you add spot lights it helps the turrets track targets and they engage from a farther distance.
---
What's the point of this post? To make you feel better? Cause I just don't see how this would help the devs focus their time to improve the game.
---
Not to say that fo76 is even close at the moment, but if it was that easy to make everything perfectly balanced, everyone else would be doing it in their games too.
---
Thanks for that - i read it and immediately felt bad about taking loot from that Level 1\*&amp; that was helping me survive. Whew!
---
Why is min/max bad? Some people enjoy that aspect of any game. Others enjoy trading. Some may enjoy role playing. Is anyone who plays differently from you a no lifer?
---
Seriously. Issue since beta, how has it not gotten any attention?
---
I don't think size is a valid portion of the comparison at this point.
---
&gt; AMA does nothing to make them look good and a whole lot to make them look bad 
---
Well said. The difference between us is not that large. I simply think they have nothing to lose. 
---
They aren't tough though LOL 3 star enemies are a joke
---
Exotic weapons dp not exist anymore. 
---
It’s not about helping devs and this subreddit isn’t dedicated to that either. This is as pointed out a community census. If you don’t feel it’s necessary then ignore it like every other post that does not interest you
---
I need to Kno bc I do the same at the train station
---
I'd love to see your experience, because I had about 80 hours in the game and had at least a dozen disconnects, crashes, enemies invisible, and phantom weight issues when they were around. 
---
Just because you were lucky enough to not experience several dc's or crashes a play session doesn't mean other people don't. 
---
Another post trying to downplay the issues with this game just because you personally are still enjoying it.
---
I love it.

And bluejean overall paint for the power farmer. 
---
No offense but I assume that anyone who assumes they "recognize a narcissist when they see one" based on a single anonymous internet comment is probably a bit of a narcissist themselves.  *shrug*
---
Put it to you this was Scout armor mods (Pocketed,Ultra-light) are there but they aren't clearly marked of they are for chest or limb armor. X-01 mods vary and you aren't even guaranteed to find what you're looking for even with hours of server hopping.
---
Not sure if you read anything I actually wrote but okay. Doesn't matter what they showed in trailers its how a majority of players play the game. They showed camp vendors in the trailers, and all kinds of other things that aren't in thr game. So the argument that in the trailer they were all small so thats how they shouls be is just low effort. 
---
None taken.
---
Yeah, your hostility and projection is kinda weird... Nothing I said was Bethesda specific.
---
Nor do I fault them specifically for this. It's just simply economics and a problem of scale.
---
Lol. I literally just got a Nocturnal rolling pin from my queen. It was 40% swing speed though....
---
1.5k hows that sound? That just about the absolute base value for these in game.
---
Nope. Try his rad rage build with a bloodied TS and then talk that shit. Again just a 1/4 of that energy.
---
Tag a community manager. They might be able to pass it up the chain as I've seen them respond to someone with a similar problem saying as much.
---
Don't know if it'll help speed things up any for you but right now it's better than the status quo.
---
550 hours since Nov 14th is 7 hours a day.  Every day.  I think you go your money's worth....
---
&gt; But are you sure they're not also stored server side along with the characters? Only reason I make the assumption that they are is I did delete my save data, and it did not affect my pics at all. Only the game settings.
---
It would be technically within the realm of possibility but with how much space a halfway decent quality pic would take up they'd easily rack up an insane amount of unnecessary extra costs just for the remote storage of any and every in-game picture taken. And I know that at least on Sony consoles it's possible for devs to store certain game data separately from both the game installation files and save data (e.g. even if you delete save data and and reinstall some EA or Ubi title they can still make it so you won't have to remember your login for their stupid 3rd party accounts that are pointless for consoles). I also seem to recall pictures/screenshots on the PS4 just being stored separately from game data by default but it's been too long of a time since I played my PS4 to say for sure.
---
Platform?
---
This is really what the game is lacking, balance. I want to be able to make a viable build for almost every armor/weapon type/perk build.
---
No armor compares to Unyielding for damage bonuses, no weapons compare to bloody melee, and no armor compares to heavy combat.
---
They don't even have to make them 'equal', just give some differing advantages like the perk cards
---
Some guy posted a video of it firing like it was a handmade. Haven't got around to confirming though. Martial artist affects fire rate for some reason.
---
Do you have rad worms / did you use a disease control to remove rad worms prior to checking your junk  weight? 
---
that's a problem with Fo76 as a whole, though. but that's what pve servers are for anyway.
---
most pvpers don't really like maintaining their builds anyhow. a little bit of grinding is fine, but spending most of the time farming ballistic fiber is not. time that could be spent shooting other players.
---
either that or nerf legendary effects by 90% so the bonus they get isn't entirely game breaking.
---
I saw three of them at the same time last night, in two different areas of the map.
---
Hey u/Harveywilliam420,
---
Would you send me a PM with your PSN ID and character name so we can look into it? Thanks in advance. 
---
Have been searching the web for this.  Would be such a great feature for players.
---
Eh ppl need to understand what viable is before that happens.
---
My buddy was doing over 3k per shot with a gatling gun before patch.. I would say you need to work on your build a whole lot of that's all you were getting out of it.
---
no bloodied ranged weapon in the game is capable of outputting 17k damage. properly built or otherwise.
---
only melee can because it scales with str. regardless, any weapon capable of outputting that much damage is op. fact.
---
Clothing is the most cost to weight efficient thing to sell. Pick up space suits for 60-70 caps per, straight jackets are 40-50. 
---
Until one of your enemies is dead. 
---
Um ok bye then? Lol I’m so sick of these I’m
---
Leaving blog post stop it no one cares stop being so dramatic it’s just a video game. 
---
Hey! You replied, thanks! 
---
I guess they really did just reuse most all code from Fo4. I was mainly curious as to if disabling the barriers also disabled Invisible walls. Idk why I thought it would. But it would be neat if it did.
---
Oh my Glob!?  You're so very right about how many ideas I had about that. Amazeballs. 
---
Because the poster above literally failed to kill the SBQ at all.
---
When I get home I might be able to mod or craft you one. 
---
Instigating just means double damage when they're at full health, no matter the weapon their effect is what it is. Nothing else is going to change that.
---
I know that there are discussions about the viability of certain weapon types taking place (i.e. heavy weapons and energy weapons), but this is something I can add as well.
---
Thank you for this feedback mate.
---
just wanted to say thanx to the bethesda team... ive been watching alot of the feedback with all the bugs, and sweing all of the haters whine because they dont like so.ething in the game.. ect.. YES 76 still has alot of problem that need addressed... and from what ive seen, the bethesda team is working on it.... thanx
---
that having been said to the haters... if  you've never programmed a computer to do even a simple task; then stop hating... the programmers are putting in millions of lines of code... 1 accidental keystroke and it could take them a month to find it... as fast as ive seen half of these fixes and hotfixes... ya'll need to bak off, give them a chance to breath... 
---
      BETHESDA TEAM.... Stop... close your eyes..  put your fingers in the locked position,..  crack them, slow down and fix the game... i dont care about the little shit cometics suck.. i care about being a lvl 111 that has trouble with a lvl68 because the targeting systems aren't working properly.. i care that  hard earned items i accidentally drop keep falling through the world...  i care not that the legendaries drop legendary items all the time ( because that would suck) But that the 3 star legendary monsters are dropping 1 star items(crap)... im a lvl100+ going alter a 3 star scorched beast a want a 3star pice of armor or a 3 star legendary weapon... and turn the BIG bosses  into 4 star legendaries.. 
---
one last thing .. i have a pvp friend in the game that got irritated that bethesda nerfed the weapons and now he cant kill the scorhed queen by himself... could you please explain to the community that the WHOLE POINT to the scorched queen is CO-Op playing... im sick of all the pvp players bitching the cant kill the queen by themselves... thanx  and thanx again for taking the time out of YOUR buisy day to lets us know that you are listeng and working to fix the problems.... Mnemoth
---
Fuck that, I asked for Fallout 5 and never cared about MMO *or* CO-OP.
---
I know a place outdoors where there's a single shot glass just floating in the air about 8 feet off the ground. I'll never tell where 'cause I don't ever want them to fix it :-P 
---
Thanks, and Would be nice, no official reply from them on that thread either...    
---
Community Manager yes, but it's the same old "keep submitting bug reports" that seems to get us no where
---
Yeah the thing about other fallout games is that the carry weights are balanced so you can carry more than a few weapons and more than one set of armor. You also didn’t need to waste perks on lame ass carry weight perks just to be able to play the game.
---
As long as the server doesn't crash
---
No, I read it. Let me simplify my argument.
---
&gt; The argument that players arent using camp as a mobile base as its intended doesn't really hold water in my opinion.  
---
&gt; You're just cherry picking things to suit your argument. You do realise the M in C.A.M.P. stands for mobile, right? 
---
So... does the M meaning mobile in C.A.M.P. not show the intent of camps being mobile not also hold water?
---
&lt;I'm not sure why I stick to pistols, I just love them.
---
quick, light, efficient, fun
---
I think people are weary of pvp since the patch. I had grafton steel, monogah pp, and the ammunition factory at the same time and no one contested. I later on had a bounty of 150 caps and no one came to collect. 
---
Guess it wasnt clear. I ment the lvls i would have to do now since i need to do almost total respect since most my points i had weight shit since inventory management is ass. So i would be fucking crippled while attempting the lvling. I do clearly hate the game at this patch since im not sinking hours to just hope to have fun again. Oh well. 
---
I’ll put you down for simply Single Player then
---
If you can't beat the SBQ with an Ivory gripped pistol and a barbed walking cane then this game is rigged!  This is obviously the build Bethesda has been pushing on us!
---
Someone said they had a pet deathclaw 
---
Clealry yoy know your vocabulary as well as you know this game. Prima Madonna and PreMadonna ha e the same meaning. 
---
*Fatalitly* Also I pressume words like Armor Armour color and colour make you *cringe* also huh? 😂😪
---
PVP and PVE damage should always be separate...yet for some F-ing reason companies continue to NOT learn from those before them.
---
Thank you. Idk how OP allegedly experienced so few bugs and crashes when playing on Xbox. I'm on One X, and granted I don't get frame drops as much and the game probably looks better than on OG Xbox One, but I am no less susceptible to disconnects and crashes.
---
Go vats, shouldn't be a big shift
---
Gotta disagree.  
---
Game would be a nightmare to balance.  In a years time you will have people with 1000+ levels.  There's already people running around in the 2-300 range after a couple months, so 100 levels per month is definitely possible. These guys doing an extra 500 per shot are supposed to somehow exist in the same game as fresh noobs out of the vault?  
---
Shit I saw a level 800+ a couple weeks ago, that guy is probably 1000 by now and would be over 10k by years end...
---
I think that's why it's better to put things in containers than just drop in bags. 
---
Is that true?? My main is a meat hook, instigating with 40% swing speed 
---
Haha, your humours ditty at the end has lightened the mood. I think I will just steer clear for now.
---
How many shots to kill a SCorch beast?
---
what is GRS?
---
In hindsight, I think you're totally right. I was staying clear of any all barrels, but when this guy smacked half my nuts off with one punch, I panic ran, and almost certainly did the radiation to myself. 
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like the ONLY things that have an effect on the whole server are powering up the nuclear plants, and that's it.
---
Sure, it's good, but like, if we are supposed to be working together, some events/quests to emphasize that would be nice.
---
**Ladies and Gentlemen of Reddit, I rest my case. This Premadonna is clueless as clueless.*
---
They already made it too easy at release, the only thing I hope is that they don't overdo making it more difficult for players so much new ones can't get in.
---
&gt; I was mainly curious as to if disabling the barriers also disabled Invisible walls
---
if i wasn't clear, the setting let's you hop the fence around the edge of the map (sometimes there is no fence though) through the invisible walls that extend from the floor to the skybox.  not sure if you mean invisible walls but those are the 'barriers' it lets you walk/jump through.
---
I mean if you have the time to waste like that in your life then good for you. But thats a big blow to alotta ppl just playing a hr or 2 a week to spend rebuilding.
---
they don't. you're factually wrong. literally just look it up.
---
These needs way more likes 
---
Yes, they are stored separately from the save data, application data etc. , In Capture Gallery sub folder. Which contains trophy screenshots, screen captures and photo mode pics.
---
Eh, I read this "it will lose internet at some point". I was confused by your confidence in being saved by a `scorchbeast left the server`.
---
That's probably the worst one I've had to deal with personally. Tried at least three times and have never beat it. My best had 12 or so minutes left and I was around 45/50. Still no idea how long it's really supposed to take.
---
If they want C.A.M.P.s to be camps they shouldn't be selling additional *building* parts, like the vault tec garage door, in the Atom Shop much less putting other large building plans in-game or making moving the thing so expensive.
---
It's just you. I've seen one in my last 3 play sessions. I've even had a couple of people try to start PvP fights with me too.
---
Maintain builds? Mate...the market is full of people looking for assassins sentinal and assassins cavaniel(pardon the spelling) with bloodied/aae handmades or shotguns... people have made perfect pvp builds and want too keep them so that they're OP for March. Plus legendary pvp fighting is the only thing thats keeping the game fresh-ish
---
I've been following along this sub for the laughs. I don't even own Fallout 76. So this is just an external perspective...
---
I don't think this would go the way you'd want it to go. It's unfortunate, because the actual dev's are the ones with the technical ability to explain the progress or non-progression on fixes-- at least to the satisfaction that this community wants it. Community managers are just dev-Twitters.
---
I assume the community wants feedback on bugs like, "The SBQ while move to an unreachable location when players do X. It has something to do with Damage Type X, however we cannot disable this because it's integral to gameplay. Please avoid Damage Type X while fighting SBQ until we find a fix."
---
It's gonna take a Dev a ton of time to write out satisfactory responses for all, or even just half the bugs that are major concerns right now. From my observations, either Bethesda doesn't have the dev's to spare (cause they'd rather them work), or dev's just don't want to do it. 
---
Dev's get paid a lot more than community managers, and although it would benefit user experience, Bethesda has systematically shown they rather just move onto the next project, than make sure their prior one is stable.
---
Most of their dev's are probably working on TES6 already. 
---
Honestly, explosive weapons were broken as fuck. Anything besides a scorch beast died in a single shot. Including players, regardless of their build- except for sentinel or cavalier with 3 points in fireproof. Now that armor is bullet proof literally without the fireproof.
---
So yeah, there's still things that need to be nerfed, and I think after that then can buff certain things.. balance is a hard thing to find and just changing numbers arbitrarily isn't the way to get there. It's a process I hope they take their time with rather than tweaking the values of everything once a week.
---
Simple. It's priceless
---
Jup, its considered both a pistol and rifle!
---
Some legendary weapons have been nerfed. 
---
I think they may have intentionally made enemies a bit tougher. I don't think it was ever their intent that a level 20 player could take out a queen. 
---
“Chances are 9.9 out of 10 they’ll close the ticket without ever looking at it”. 
---
Saying that requires some very paranoid, culty views. 
---
Nobody who has ever worked in a large organization and has the most basic, minimal understanding of how anything anywhere works. 
---
You put up a sign saying you’re clueless (which is ok, we’re all clueless about many things in the world), but you then proceeded to build opinion and predictions based on your ignorance, in all
---
likelihood because that particular opinion affirms some held views. And following the smoke to the fire, the views your proclamation would affirm is the circle-jerk cult. 
---
You’re human, buddy. And that means you do things normal humans do. And that makes anyone who gets how humans operate see and understand what you’re doing. 
---
That does help tons, but even doing that I've still never been able to finish it .
---
Also rarely see nukes, is this signs of the end?
---
I'm waiting for it to be nerfed.
---
Survival mode won't launch until things are balanced
---
Im sure they wont do it, they would get destroyed. That was not meant to be malicious, but im sure an AMA would be bad news for Bethesda. I would be very surprised if they do. 
---
But it sure would be cool to see answers for a lot of stuff, or at least see a response that doesnt include “we are looming into it”. 
---
I wish the 10mm was viable in this game... :(
---
Huh, Arbitrations clauses must also be known to the State of California to cause cancer.
---
Curious to the cost..do they break down into 5 ballistic fiber or anything crazy? That's one of the only materials I have trouble keeping enough of. 
---
yeap. just take rank 1 Iron Fist/Gladiator if you don't believe me and test it out yourself.
---
All ranged weapons need to be tweaked.   
---
No melee doesn't need to be nerfed, ranged needs to be buffed.   
---
Humor me...   
---
At level 50 with a vanilla super sledge a melee character can one shot trash ghouls, MoleRats and PowerAttack one hit allot of other lower end mobs..  
---
And they should be able to.    
---
And a level 50 with a fully upgraded hunting rifle should be able to do the same thing...  (Assuming head shots and the same perk Loadout) It should not take 5 rounds.. It shouldn't take 6 - 12 rounds with a .44 to drop a basic Ghoul...  Or a clip of 10mm ammo..  
---
Ultracite is useless in large quantities, feel free to vendor it. You only need one for each ammo bulk. Hardened mass is found on mobs in nuked areas. 
---
Yes.  They have been for a while now.  The conduit / switches plan is now correctly called Advanced Power Connectors.
---
They are already free to join if you just walk into the area... but I assume you mean they should be free fast travel points?
---
Hard to say, since they’re plentiful enough that this could be used as a fast travel cost work around. 
---
Unfortunately combat events do scale based on the number of and the level of its participants. A sudden influx of players jumping into an event just for the fast travel could mess up the event for others legitimately trying to participate in them.
---
That said... there should most definitely be a timer displayed on the map for events.
---
That's not what it means.  "Running" is pushing all the way on the controller.  "Running" while stealthed is crouching and pushing forward all the way.  Otherwise you need to barely push the controller forward and move at approximately the rate you would if encumbered.  Standing means no stealth at all.  
---
So the answer is yes. They do disappear lol
---
Issue is in this game there are entire weapon types that are barely usable. 
---
This happened to me just last night, and I've seen it before a couple of times too.
---
As a CA resident, they do.
---
Did they unfuck the elevator yet? 
---
What about the rest of the chimney?
---
Hey buddy where did you get the plans for that gun you are holding 
---
Nice! Good to know. 
---
alot of the bugs can be more apparent during player interaction 
---
That's crazy. But if they patch it then I'd have a bunch of useless one handed perks.. 
---
True, even more so because you would already sell said junk if marine helmets didn't exist. 
---
I'm on Xbox and most of my captures of my husband are him doing something in his skivvies.  He always seems to load in his underwear when we go place to place.  Or, one of us is completely invisible to the other, even if we're standing right next to each other.  That makes teamwork hard sometimes because we can't find each other!
---
My favorite capture I got just a few day ago.  My husband loaded in his undies again, but technically had power armor on.  So his character has distorted and elongated limbs that fit the power armor shape.
---
I noticed that luck of the draw triggers far less than lucky break in general, I don't run it normally.
---
Disclaimer, I run a non-auto build so I fire less rounds ie:chance to trigger is less
---
Scary that your post got deleted though. Please keep us updated. 
---
I think powered spotlights (also under the turret category) can trigger your turrets.
---
I installed some of those after finding a liberator chipping away at my fusion reactor without triggering my missile turrets, but haven't had them long enough to see them work.
---
I also tried placing an extra turret near the problem spot, and attacking it seems to aggro the rest of my turrets, but that's a waste of budget if spotlights work.
---
Well yes it is! You are right I saw a nuke drop on prime today and literal and one 73 showed up and two 50 levels. 
---
Understand. But since adding one to my camp, my crops have not been damaged at all by the random spawns of mole rats and mutants. My heavy turrets and missile launcher take em out immediately.
---
Actually this is not entirely true. Depending on the placement of the camp sometimes a camp there will not affect the vendor spawning. I've gotten the vendor to spawn numerous times with a camp there. 
---
I did notice that the outfit my character had been wearing was swapped with a different outfit in my inventory the other day.
---
Nothing had been deleted.
---
Sadly there is only one with a keypad. 
---
Yes I am aware.  Balance is still hard to come by and Bethesda is definitely approaching this in a tried and true and stupid way that other companies have used and failed with.
---
The map design makes that a stupid idea. You'd be forced into wearing power armor to traverse horizontally on the map
---
Don't disagree with you there at all. 
---
I get it there's a disconnect, which is why I said what I said earlier.
---
All I'm saying is let's not pretend that camps weren't intended to be temporary and mobile. It's in the name.
---
Try storing all your junk into your Stash, or out of your Stash and into your Inventory.
---
Sometimes it doesn't like materials being split between your person and your stash.
---
And I had someone tell me the mods auto-scrapping themselves for material requirements was one of those bugs that didn't exist and everyone kept making it up because they're just too stupid to manage not accidentally losing them while blaming Bethesda for it. Well at least until I posted a screenshot of the easily reproducible bug myself where the crafting UI literally spelled out that my weapon repair was about to use one of my mods as steel. And that was just about a week or so before the patch notes that fixed it. lol
---
Very nice!  Taking out SB with a couple swings must feel OP.  Sort of like TSE before they nerfed 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤷🏼‍♂️
---
It’s like cop showed up at your door and ask you for a video proof that you did not murder someone a year ago. 
---
The problems are blown way out of proportion, but they are present. I see a long dog every 2-3 queen fights. I blue screen every few hours. I dropped a piece of gear spamming the drop button in my junk menu. The second time it happened it was my power armor chest, so I noticed, thank Todd.
---
There are two Dynamics at work. People are outraged, far more than necessary for the game. Part of the fury is because of the power armor edition bags, nuka dark rum, leather jacket, etc. That outrage is being pointed at this game like a gas pump spraying a camp fire.
---
The other part is that the game is great, and broken. People really wanna roll around in this game like a warm blanket from the dryer. Unfortunately, the bugs and crashes are like static electricity shocking them out of their nice warm blanket. 
---
Bethesda made what I really call a great game, but handled it very badly. They launched too early, under a cloud.  They haven't been terribly meticulous about their patches and  regression testing. They've made questionable decisions with game balance that don't address a current problem, rather than fix clear and present problems. It's clear mismanagement of man power. I'm looking at you battlecry studios. I mean.... Bethesda Austin.
---
Great game, bad management.
---
Crafted 40 Fire axes and walked around with them, have 2 exact copies of a random legendary in my inventory. I'll report here if I get banned, but pretty sure if that doesn't do it then these reports of being banned for crafting are false rumors.
---
Entire  weapons were killed in the process. Blanket nerfs = fail.
---
I’m sure they’re gonna do so much for the game to make it better..... lol
---
How about how we talk about when you started trading god tier weapons and armor 2 weeks ago?
---
I have always wondered what was causing that. I never understood why I had more carry weight when I first logged in. 
---
Since the patch (or at least the hotfix) one time last night I noticed I was encumbered and couldn't sprint, but it didn't display the red icon in the bottom corner. I dumped some items, fast traveled and it was fine after that.
---
This reminds me of Skyrim. Dragon priest masks could also not be worn with hats/hoods. So maybe we need a community mod/fix for this 🤔
---
On Xbox, my husband will load in his underwear a lot, even if he's fully clothed or in power armor.
---
The one that is the most annoying though is when one of us becomes completely invisible to the other.  We're standing right next to each other, but one of us is invisible.  That makes teamwork very difficult sometimes.
---
Yeah i killed the flatwoods monster which happens to be a zetan.
---
Oh totally. I think it was the two shots mostly though. Personally, I've got a bloodied explosive lever action at 25 that was my "shit got real" gun. Even at almost no health full rifleman, and demo expert, it took 2-3 shots to take out lv68 ghouls or scorched. If it had been a 2 shot? Way OP.
---
Really I think that just removing the possibility to create TSE would have worked fine. Two shot OR explosive, never both. Fixed!
---
Im down for cold beer.
---
Put all of your junk in stash and try again. It was supposed to be fixed.
---
What do you mean by this? 
---
Energy and explosive weapons aren't viable. A few heavy ones as well.  That's a lot of guns. 
---
Its been mentioned before but……Server Wide Events 
---
One of my best memories of Lord of the Rings Online – from years ago, was a server wide event, a message went out that orks were attacking an area, and players from all over the map all came together and worked together to fight off what was happening  - I only remember this happening once in all the years I played that game, but word of mouth from an event like that can massively increase players and bring new people to the fold.
---
I understand that to make this work, the various servers have to be able to run without crashing – not an easy task, but im sure it will get there.
---
But just to be playing the game doing your own thing, and suddenly a “radio call” goes out stating that SM have been seen moving down the road towards Flatwoods, players from all over the map all come together to fight them off, all working together as a massive team, stories are made, videos / pictures end up on social media and this leads to more players. – and should the SM get to Flatwoods…. Then for x amount of time Flatwoods is full of them, and becomes a “no-go area” unless we can work and clear it out!
---
No in game auction house, no vendor capability, no central hub.  Sounds Bethesda is incorporating vault tech method.
---
Btw, now that I'm home and in front of the PS4. I did look at all of the "save data" on my system for 76, and it amounts to "settings" which is all of 3.15 MB. Definitely nothing of substance relating to characters or data to speak of. Also checked online storage, and it contained that same "settings" file along with a file named "control settings", which also only weighed in around 3.15 MB. 
---
LOL is it a shotgun with 9% accuracy? cause they do that... its a close range weapon.
---
I’m a bit worried about how energy weapons are listed here but other underperforming weapons aren’t. Please look in to redoing weapon, armor and perk balance individually and not just buffing or nerfing things by category. 
---
The changes made a while back to buff full auto weapons created quite a few balance problems by overtuning weapons that didn’t need the damage buff to begin with but still left many automatics woefully underpowered. 
---
Isn’t the world divided into cells, and if a player hasn’t visited a cell within X number of minutes, the cell is unloaded and when visited again it will be freshly populated?  So, how long your items persist depends on how continually visited by players the location is where you left them.
---
NP
---
If you havent played 3 or NV I'd recommend them over a 12th FO4 playthrough - both are incredibly enjoyable games (some would argue both are better than 4 as well)
---
Lucky Bastar.... I mean good for him :P
---
Yes. The actually fixed it.
---
Yes a icon on the map showing wears would be nice, much like Rust vending machines. You can choose to broadcast or not.
---
They said a while back that they're looking into player vending machines or something along those lines.
---
It's coming. How or when is another thing.
---
Not double but 50% increase. Side effect also. 
---
&gt; you keep making statements and arguments that demonstrate that you don't fully understand. 
---
You know what? I'm sure that you are right. I don't fully understand how probability works.  
---
I should not have even tried to debate that with you. 
---
So the RNG in this game is in accordance with the laws of probability that you are speaking of. 
---
How does that make for a good game design? 
---
I mean, in an earlier post, you suggested that the rarity of plans/ mods could be an incentive to keep playing the game. 
---
Do you really think people want to  keep running the same event if they have done it 50 times already and every single time got the exact same mod, based on the possibility that they MIGHT get it on the 51st try? 
---
I can't speak for anyone else, but I had quit running he Distant Thunder event in the hopes that I might get plans for T51 calibrated shocks. I just got tired of it. 
---
When they decided to make the plans a permanent vendor item that cost 5800 caps, THAT provides an incentive to keep playing. 
---
I know that the plan is obtainable. I just have to grind for caps and then I have to grind for the rare materials to make the shocks.  THAT is an incentive to play the game. 
---
are you being dense on purpose? to hit for 17k damage, with Covert Operator, a ranged weapon would need to have **6.8k** listed damage. and that's no accounting for a sneak power attack, which ranged doesn't have. otherwise it's closer to **9520** (17k * 1.4 = 23.8k / 2.5 = 9520)
---
prove that I'm wrong. show me one ranged weapon that can hit for 10k damage.
---
Ok but it was completely overpowered and DID need a balance... but they decided to nuke the hell out of it from high orbit.
---
Actually, I just wanted Fallout 5.... 
---
not sure... I believe it does according to the wiki.
---
Haha good point. It seems silly to me, but this hoarding/grinding game that has a limit to how much wealth you can accrue. Once you are at endgame, there isn’t anything to buy. And you cannot just keep gaining caps. 
---
Yes this did it. Thank u very much for the quik response!! 
---
Thank you for the tip. It worked! 
---
No clue. I've been stuck having it untouched on my shelf for a good couple of weeks now.
---
Well, they did add gun-fu so all bets are off.
---
I can safely say melee prolonged my stay
---
Well no problem mate! I wasn’t sure myself for a second. 
---
Unless they changed how vendor inventories operate and didn't note it, that has not been my experience. I've had friends standing right next to me on the same server and get a different vendor inventory. 
---
In fact, just last week I finally got the Charleston vendor event to spawn, I logged in with each of my characters. Each time the inventory was different and was also always different than my friend who stayed logged on while I got each of my characters.
---
So if they did change how vendor inventories work, it was with this most recent patch and there was no documentation that I saw spelling it out.
---
Yep, this bug is apparently back after the hotfix, could have been patch 5 though, but I think it was the hotfix.
---
I don't know about EVERY build but a lot more would be nice. 
---
Also viable is very subjective. Some people thing that without pre-nerf TSE, nothing is viable.
---
They said they're working on the heavies and energies so that's coming.
---
Complaints have always been louder than praise online, and no one complains when things go right.
---
I get that it was OP but omg they killed it. It’s a legendary weapon it should do more damage than my normal shotgun. I really hope enough people bring this to Bethesda’s attention and they fix it. 
---
I would love a Furious, 40% increased Swing Speed Commie Whacker. I would giggle all day while using that.
---
I took an extra few minutes in the bathroom to play games on my phone and BETHESDA BANNED ME!! 
---
The only problem with this is the need for more cloud storage and that's expensive, so maybe once FO76 becomes more polished and more people actually buy the game and stop needlessly hating on it they may increase camp size. 
---
I could be wrong though, hopefully I am.
---
Oh, was just a joke. "Known to the State of California to cause cancer" is a common thing on labels due to Proposition 65.  
---
Though, I guess the joke doesn't pan out, because Proposition 65 only requires the label be on the product and the joke mostly implies that that's why the clause wouldn't work in California.
---
I'd guess the variances are due to level locks. So the plans are there, just lower level players only get to pick from a curated list based on their present level.  
---
To confirm that make a level 1 and go to those same stations, you'll probably find that a lot of the plans are not available to that new character but your lvl 67 has more options.
---
Yeah since the patch slots 1 2 3 need to redone every time i relog.  
---
That is until 5 minutes later and every explosive weapon you have is broken so you gotta swap to a different weapon or stick with grenades.
---
I meant maintining as in fixing. my armor and weapon broke after a few dozen encounters while wanted.
---
but I digress. legendaries are a sure fire way to make sure survival fails. remember how fun stacked bobbleheads bypassing slap damage were? that's survival with legendaries enabled.
---
Pretty sure you can bulk screws.
---
Similar to what others have noted, this upcoming fix is intended to correct an issue that causes players to become WANTED and have a Bounty even if they accidentally hit someone else's C.A.M.P. This fix will make it so only destroyed objects in C.A.M.P.s will add a Bounty and WANTED status. 
---
You're not going to get one.
---
The  lower base damage than Rifle counter parts, perk bloat in AGI, and no Anti-Armor perk = BAD TIMES.
---
A recipe for disaster.  Heavy guns and pistols got really obliterated with the TSE nerf, as TSE carried them. Heavy and Energy were already unplayable trash. So that's 4 entire weapon styles that are gutter shit. 
---
Fun game.
---
No problem, Thank you for putting it under consideration, if it helps push this game forward for the better I'm all for it.
---
Ya loot away my friend loot away!
---
The more you give gaming companies money for broken products that they will take 5 years to fix is empowering con men and women.

Whilst you tubers are a pain in the ass you don't have to click them, If you become a Bethesda customer your kinda stuck with a £60 tea coaster.

Lol thanks, I was part of the 5th Louisiana Infantry civil war reenactors in my days of highschool. It was a blast (no pun intended).
---
Fastest pin in the west
---
I understand there are better ways to do this, but I think every solution probably needs at least a timer. Other info will help players better decide if an event is viable, but without a timer any other info is only marginally better than the current situation.  
---
We understand dev resources are limited, and in this case I think just adding the timer and improving it later would be preferable to most players than just not having anything until you are able to complete a full solution.
---
I haven’t noticed it, but I run luck of the draw 3 and don’t use TSE weapons. Perhaps the explosion causes durability loss?
---
\* over looks the vastly improved UI, better snapping, bulldozer... \*
---
I got a furious cryolator and a 50% speed BP pistol if you're looking for 3 stars.
---
Well ranged is kinda shit now, most guns are really bad. Rifle Vats and Explosive Shotgun are the only good options.

God will they please get 1 patch right?

You didn't answer his question. What is the point of a "community consensus" on this matter.
---
&gt; **Energy Weapon Durability and Performance**  
---
&gt;**STATUS:** We are aware of issues with energy weapons and are investigating.  
---
&gt;**Salvaged Assaultron Head Consumes Ammo in One Shot**  
---
&gt;**STATUS:** We’re aware of this issue and are addressing it in a future update.
---
Is there a reason these weapon issues never seem to be a priority?  Why aren't these going to be in the next patch? Assaultron head dates clear back to FO4.
---
Now let me *learn* you something else *boy* No word was ever a word until it was created and related to a meaning and or definition. *Have a nice day*
---
I've been trying to bring attention to this and been met with nothing but "Pistols are fine"
---
Yeah it takes off some of the grind. I get survival but like, 93% of the game felt like a grind for ammo, gears/useful junk or fusion cores to me. It's fallout, I want to explore without a *constant worry* of fusion cores or getting stuck with low power/surrounded with no ammo. I've never done a melee build in any game but this game kinda forced it. 
---
Instead of a weapons-based boost, it should be a max perks boost, like maxing all the heavy gunners cards and demolition and maybe one or two others. And make the perks boost to damage really big and worth it. So to get the Big Bonus you have to really commit to the build or, for high-level players, you have to at least have a lot of cards in use. 
---
I'm thinking it's going to have to do with the vault in the mire (94?). My guess is that it got overrun by strangle root after a  GEK experiment gone wrong. 
---
no, gatling. regular, not laser. but also a laser rifle, this one was the worst: the two beams fired in opposite directions, both at 90 degrees.
---
I looked to my right and saw the burn mark from the laser.
---
Yeah that is why the explosive nerf was a huge nerf for me unfairly. I finially had a 10 mm pistol that had two shot and explosive on it. It had 170 damage and could kill stuff in a few shots if i was sneaking. Now it does 60 damage and it takes three rounds to kill a lv 20 enemy.
---
Would have to agree. I very much doubt they will refund anywhere.
---
Congrats..
---
Grim Reaper's Sprint.
---
Well then it's likely that it just directly reads from that folder so you can delete everything but that and reinstall without it making a single difference in whether your load screen pics will be there or not even without them being stored remotely.
---
Sorry to beat the dead horse, but the bigger problem is not just the heavy weapon balance issue, but the "Balance" of the TS(e) gutted the Demo build completely.   
---
Walking that back and using one of the many suggested alternatives that don't involve crippling entire builds and classifications of weapons would be wonderful, the easiest being adjusting the original Explosive Legendary effect so it does not benefit from the Explosive perks at all, leaving it a flat +25 points of damage, which is powerful, but relatively balanced and going from there.
---
Ugh.
---
Same too with vendor bot Greg out in Grafton.
---
Grenades are a lot of fun tbh. I’ve found that I generally only have durability issues with the missile launcher, which can be mitigated slightly with the weapon artisan perks. Even so, once that big fella breaks I usually switch to the grenade launcher, and that lasts me a very long while. Plus, grenade launcher rounds are cheap to make which is nice
---
I don't think capitalism would work if you could return stuff way after purchasing. You can't go to a ticket booth and demand money back over a crap movie. Why is 76 special? Those who pre-ordered and were literally unable to play the game have a case. But "unhappy with the direction" is far from a good reason.
---
I can’t help but wonder why?

Around "Top of the World" there are tons of beer bottles.

Not that I know of. You'd expect at least some cloth when you scrap an outfit but in every case I've tried it gives you nothing and you lose the item.

eh, it's just 3 really. and you should have enough str to accommodate them.

About as much point as a post about naming a Deathclaw Gary. This isn’t trying to bring about some revolution of change or address some wild issue. It’s a post that people in the Reddit can simply participate in. I’m simply curious. I had a question to ask and if people wanted to reply to it they could. There doesn’t have to be any “point” beyond that

Disagree with tse. Pretty useless right now. One shotting everything melee, 8 to 10 shots with tse. Gg.

Toot Toot bitches
---
I traded for a furious weight reduced Railway rifle and was so so disappointed when I went to use it for the first time...   
---
There are a ton of weapons that need major "rebalancing".. All ranged IMHO (but the handmade which is oddly good)...  
---
Hell, the Broadsider is worthless, doing less than most rifles.
---
If you look at other comments in this post, it's not clear how that works, nor if that's the only problem.
---
People at the same level at the same time looking at the same vendor apparently have different results.
---
Not saying you're wrong. Just that there could be a lot more to it than just that.
---
I’m wanted I was trying to be a bounty hunter an accidentally shot the dudes camp

There should be fewer and bigger events, like the scorchbeast queen, but for different stages of the game and different factions.

Greg is the Camden bot vendor lol 
---
I have max strength but zero one handed perks lol. And since I'm switching my build and I'm level 110 it takes forever 
---
There’s a mod called Better Inventory that does a lot of this.   It will probably be awhile before they add that functionality to the game with everything else going on in the game.  Google is your friend. 
---
No the server does lol
---
Thank you sincerely for the response, i hope this issue can be fixed before others are effected by it and can enjoy roaming the wasteland in style :D
---
Mmmm, that sweet dual wield gun kata. I would 100% roll a Grammaton Cleric.
---
Which sucks but I never had the ammo to make Them useful really anyways. I don't know how I managed to fuck it up so badly when everyone else is like "I just scrapped 50009 ammo so I didn't drown." I'm like "this ammo vendor just took almost all my caps so I could get 70 weak bullets to do a sliver of damage to this scorchbeast.." I'm hoping there's a hump I can get over where it gets easier and less grindy, but until then, sledge 
---
Um, they'll check with the dev team and get back to you after the next stable release. 
---
HAHAHAHAH this is awesome...... I need this in my life.
---
PS4 Pro Game crashes to blue screen 2-3 times a day , it is very hard to join other games with out game crashing or stuck in never ending load screen. Had countless items disappear from inventory specifically mods. I love the game but it is getting hard to play. Just a quick question why not be able to lock certain items in your inventory so you cannot accidentally drop high value items or trade them for free.  
---
That is illegal. Also you get VAC'd, which you keep your games, just can't play any VAC games online on VAC servers, which 99.99% are.
---
Oh well that is easy enough. It's called your equation is missing one very important factor and that is (rate of fire × velocity × damage output × distance = Equivalent damage) 
---
*Someone call a fire truck! Little homie just got burned*
---
And, that's an excuse for sub-standard work? 
---
The Superbowl is only a game, and look at the shit storm that came down due to the missed call. 
---
Sloppy is sloppy regardless of your profession. 
---
they will. its just to kill the market, its all about money.
---
While I agree that they could use a buff, there's ways to make them work. You have to actually put some thought into your perk investment. 
---
Using regular weapons isn't like TSE, where you can one- shot kill everything with near zero thought put into how you invest your perks.  I know people with TSE rifles who had invested  virtually nothing in rifleman and were one- shot killing everything. 
---
The idea is something they are aware of and working on. 
---
You Brotherhood scum are all the same. I hope we get a PvP area in the future where we can wipe out the vermin that your group are.
---
Nope, no plan today, weird.
---
I was wondering about something... if you have a Weapon/Mutation/Perk that deals radiation damage, and you fight a ghoul (They heal from radiation) does that heal them?
---
Umm... I think you mean Chad.

post a link to reputable source. preferably the where you got that, because I think you got it off urbandictionary.

Different server, same scorchbeast
---
someone in a thread about camp budget said that they thought that camp items take up less budget at you level up; but they thought that something you built at level 10 is still taking up the same amount of budget at level 80, you have to scrap it and rebuild it for it to cost less budget. i have been reluctant to test this yet, but might try it next time i move.
---
Maybe they would consider number 1 if your rambling request didn't make you sound like a total dick bag.
---
It’s about as different as New Vegas was to 3. I’m fine with it running on the same engine and being very similar to F4. What I’m not fine with is the lack of content or initiative on Bethesda’s behalf.
---
It’s very telling who they choose to respond to. It’s usually short snippet comments. It’s never the well-thought-out comments with lots of viable points. 
---
A "pistol build" lol. Why wouldn't anyone build their character around a weapon meant as a backup weapon? A pistol is a sidearm for shooting roaches or to use if your main weapon breaks. It's not a main weapon, nor should it be.
---
I suppose you think rifles should do the same damage as a missile launcher too?
---
I'd like to know how you know what most of them are thinking
---
Turrets aside, I wish I could be half as creative building camps.
---
Having said that, a spotlight on each side would make this a monster.
---
yes, and you're factually wrong about this one.
---
I am ok with it. I got to play early for a 1/3rd a tank of gas.
---
Lol! 
---
Never had a thing contested, and only seen 3 or 4 people wanted. The fo76 community are usually pretty chill from what I've seen and avoid pvp. 
---
This happened to me too. The amusement park worker outfit I was wearing disappeared when I logged into game leaving me naked.
---
This game needs Thanos. 
---
Seriously, thank you (and this entire community) for taking the time out of all your days to post feedback like this.
---
We take everything you say seriously. We absolutely love how dedicated you all are to this game. We want nothing more than to ensure you are having a great time, and conversations like this are fundamental to that happening.
---
Every answer would be “we’re aware of it and working on it”. 
---
Well, if the damage to both gun and explosion from impact we're boosted, isn't that double the damage? It would basically mean tse weapons would be would like... Game meta and that's not something I wanted to think about. 
---
I never saw one person loose their whole account, VAC bans ban you from VAC games, and online in VAC servers.
---
Remember it's just a game 
---
Oh, yeah, you can get those with a perk. I misunderstood you.
---
Nuka-Molotov
---
Does rad damage basically
---
Red Dead SP is straight up amazing. Online is trash, IMO. 
---
Thank you. 100% this. What’s the point if everybody‘s armor and weapons are the same? There would be no incentive to play this mode whatsoever. I‘m spending countless hours BECAUSE I WANT TO BE FUCKING BETTER EQUIPPED AFTERWARDS. Why would I play this mode if there is no way to improve my gear? Just to collect some screws and fight a player every couple of hours? I don’t think so....
---
I'm on PS4 as well and I have a couple friends who play it. We just got bored and moved on until more content arrives.
---
yep, the super bowl is just a game also. Important versus not important. Just play the game or don't. Complain or don't. Don't expect everyone to get their pitchfork out cause they tool away your ultra mega blaster.
---
I had a deathclaw [uppercut his own Head after I shot it off](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/tempest-storm27/video/68105738). Good times
---
You're talking about the Veteran Ranger outfit from New Vegas correct? Yes I'd love that. 
---
I also would mind seeing the crazy faction outfits from Nuka World show back up. Some of those were pretty cool. 
---
Maybe a variety used camo pack for all guns. Not the clean like it was just painted camo but beat up. Urban, forest, winter, desert, and whatever else. Weapons need a bit of variety. 
---
On the subject of weapons maybe a clean look for all as well, for those that find that one gun and would want to clean it real well and get it looking super nice. 
---
Yeah. It’s all BS. Copy / Paste. Looks like they are ‘staying’ up with the community. It satisfies a few. 
---
Well no shit it came from the urban dictionary you are the one who said look there. But you failed to acknowledge the (2) section which was the top part of my comment and the bottom part of my comment is from the actual meaning of prima donna. So ya know, You tried to to fire back and once again only back fired. 
---
*Tell the grave digger it will need to be a big hole to fit this prick and all his shit*
---
That sounds to me like a fixed list that’s gonna reset on a timer so instead of taking let’s say 20 hours of my time if we’re lucky it’ll instead take months to get the item I want and that’s if I check every reset :(
---
Rather than an AMA, I'd just like to see devs be active on here. Not every day of course but from time to time, particularly to deal with pressing issues or to nip issues/controversies in the bud. 
---
There are a ton of online games that have active dev participation. I don't see why Bethesda doesn't either.
---
It's durability :D
---
If you decide to ever return to the game there is a room inside The Whitespring resort on the shop aisle with every crafting station and your stash box. Just amble on in and craft in relative safety.
---
i'm going to be on soon
---
Gonna be interesting to watch that romanticize ritual -  I got a pretty large contact list in 76, have no idea how many, but it does scroll for a while before it reaches the end,  logged in yesterday to see who was on..  Only one person on that list was online, and that was a dude who I given noob armor to when he was fresh out of the vault, and never interacted with him again.
---
Haha see the plans are my favorite part. I have a production design degree so spent a long time making plans. Usually for things way way way outside my budget.  Though the last video I watched was wiring a lamp which was helpful because I was making some lamps as gifts. Safety first. 
---
Hm I will just grab the shish kebab plan then
---
So being butthurt gives you the power to know the motivation of someone you've never met?
---
you know this will only resolve in bethesda nerfing melee weapons, right?
---
Guess it's good that you get both when you buy it. Online is pretty fun.
---
I ran a pistol build in FO4, I forget the name but the pistol you got from that quest for the Railroad people.  Tried it in 76 and ended up taking an extended break because its so weak.  My wife is mowing stuff down and i'm a weakling.  I don't really get why you would use a pistol build in 76 at this point because there isn't any end game viability, but i'm too lazy to level another character.  They need to either make them viable end game or make it more clear they aren't / won't be.
---
Just don't waste your time picking perk cards for melee because it's the next stop on the Nerf train.
---
It does, I checked before I made the post.
---
I only use a tse lever with a a silencer and furious power fist on my stealth sniper build I can 1 shot or hit most things 
---
Same for me on PS4. I haven't blue screened once since the patch. I've only had one server d/c. It was so nice owning workshops and being able to collect on them. 
---
You have to grind for better loot then. Period. Seriously, of course there will be and have to be players with better gear! There has to be a reason to play the mode. I don’t want to spend countless hours without the possibility of earning more powerful loot. It is not enough to fight another player every other hour.
---
All bloodied everything like we gang banging
---
I don't run Auto Weapons normally, just a Gatling for Queen Battles, but it used to trigger regularly for me pre-patch, I'm also burning 5-6 times the ammo I did pre-patch as well.
---
I will savour the opportunity to gun you down as you flounder towards me.
---
Uh huh go back to your urban dictionary and finish reading that page. Since you are clearly only a skimming reader I know it will be painful, *Though not nearly as painful as realizing you are wrong*
---
Can you please make tamed creatures appear with a non hostile health bar, and maybe even the owners name? Or at the very least allow us to use a number of stims to revive them, like you rebuild your base? I'm sick of having my sloth killed by a startled passer by, they take forever to find. 
---
It also badly needs a mod slot that can take a recoil control mod. 
---
No, it should be doing the full dmg, the way they handled the TS(e) Rebalance was, well, not good.
---
we're talking dps now? because with 40% faster swing speed melee out-dps' any ranged weapon.
---
even full autos can't dish out enough damage to out dps what, 3 swings per second? each putting out over 17k damage? not even the LMG can shoot 50 rounds per second. and even if it did, the tooltip damage woud have to be 1000.
---
except it's closer to 50.
---
Even though plans are supposed to be permanent at vendors now, I have yet to see them sold for dense mods. I do occasionally see the mod itself available for purchase in Watoga.
---
Tse Gatling gun X4. One breaks, switch to the next.
---
Haven’t played since patch so I’m sure I’ll need to redo my weapons 
---
Sweet. Do you remember where exactly did you pick it up from?
---
Please replace the demolition expert, two shot and explosive bullets %s.. These nerfs hurt the game and ruined many weapons usability.
---
Fixing one weapon isn't worth ruining many. Also most people are upset by the two shot explosive nerf. Please revert these changes
---
Okay. Just let me know
---
Please do an AMA
---
What about the auto receiver and commando? 
---
The enemies don’t get stronger after level 80+, so there doesn’t seem to be a point to adding damage to certain weapons. Also if your level 200+ automatic, high fire rate weapons will become OP.
---
Monthly/weekly devstreams like warframe does could really help out the game! Of course you'd have to filter out the actual suggestions from the nonhelpful toxicity
---
The thing that's becoming increasingly clear with FO76 is that Bethesda literally has nobody working there who knows how to balance a game. With all the single player titles we always kind of joked around about bad balance and how the modders had to fix it, but it never seemed like that big of a deal.
---
But with this game, where it's blatantly obvious that the total lack of balance is ruining the game for basically everyone who likes to work from a character concept to a working build, and not from whatever works to their character it's clear that they just don't know what to do about it. There isn't even any indication that they are aware of the problem or understand why people would want to have the ability to make unique and interesting builds to suit their playstyle without getting horribly punished for it.
---
The Creation Engine is getting more love and attention? Seriously?
---
So all those bugs which we had since day 1 and are very similar to bugs from Skyrim/Fallout 4 should not be related to the engine? Because the engine received some love and fixes?!
---
They replaced the renderer. And smashed a multiplayer with survival mechanics on top. Or they just digged it out and reactivated from the Gambryo backbones (because it feels like this). But besides that, the physics is again coupled to frame rate. So we received the 60fps lock. A big number of items cause server instabilitg. So a maximum carry weight was introduced. Similar to the maximum limit of NPC in Skyrim, before instability was reached - caused by this cell-based loading. Items with missing keywords are another bug, which could be easily resolved by using so called "interfaces" in programming. Duping exists because of de-sync. between clients and severs. Don't know how to fix such a problem, but it shows that even new things are not implemented with love.
---
So...I think I am blind, because I don't see the "love and attention" that Bethesda gives to the Creation Engine. I see only an old sinking Titanic repaired with more and more duckt tape. Oh yeah, and it got a new painting from the atomic store.
---
TSE 10mm Submachine Gun &amp; AASS Deathclaw Gauntlet with talons, marsupial, twisted  muscles, healing factor, and class freak. I used to have a sniper build before but couldn't get a decent enough sniping rifle so I just went commando ;-)
---
This guy doesnt PR.
---
Think of it this way, people who have no issues with the game or at least very few issues have no reason to post about it. It's running as intended, why make a point out that?
---
People who do have issues make a post. We don't know how many experienced them outside of each person making a post about it, though 20 people complaining about a bug already seems like a lot to an individual (compared to the thousands of players, pretty small though). I upvote issues other people despite not personally experiencing them myself to bring attention to it.
---
Tl;dr: We have no clue whether the minority is the one with or without issues.
---
They just gotta increase the grind
---
I'd tell you but I'm afraid they'll nerf it 
---
more often than not the top definition is the correct one. which is why it's at the top, because it was voted the best, the most accurate.
---
Agree, got to high level and realized it too late.  Its silly at this point to even bother trying with pistols when everything else is so much more powerful.
---
There's not a report category of having glitched items. So any Feedback ticket wont be replied back.
---
It would break after 5 shots. 
---
you're doing what most people call not being a whiny bitch, or a new vegas fanboy
---
i run a ts+fast reload pipe gun, and a vampire bowie knife. (ts+fast reload pipe bolt when low ammo)
---
What will you do when they nerf it?
---
I'm on PC and I've noticed no changes to stealth. I run Sneak 3, Escape Artist 1. I have the chameleon mutation but it never activates since I use armor. My chestpiece makes me invisible when sneaking and not moving. My limbs are all shadowed, and either 1 or 2 of them also have the legendary effect that makes sneaking better.
---
I'm not trying to disagree with OP; but the QA and/or Dev team need data points. It could be some other interaction that I dont have going on (my mutation doesnt apply, for example). Or it could be only on some platforms.
---
Hopefully they can get to the bottom of it.
---
its got a pipe rifle style look so it really should fall under pipe weapon and rifle 
---
that said I'd love a entire railway themed set like railway pistol and railway multi launcher (fires 6 spikes at once and is a heavy weapon) 
---
what about the top definition though? are you just ignore that? because it clearly states that you're wrong.
---
but what's more, a quick google search will also prove you wrong.
---
Only 29% of gamers are under 18, 42% of that 29% are console gamers. 
---
If fallout was released in 1997, and the average gamer is over 35, then the average gamer has been around and experienced gaming in the 90s and all the things you talked about and more. I remember writing config files and running home servers for games, that doesnt mean I am OK with a glitchy ass AAA game release. COD cant do it because we all know they never gave a shit about customers only money, fallout used to care, fallout used to be great, now all they care about is money also... so we are bitching and complaining because we have been betrayed, young or old we all know what fallout used to be some are ok with an aging company fucking up, others expect experience to produce better results.
---
Yeah I think people want an "Ask Me Literally Anything and I Will Answer Honestly.
---
AMLAIWAH
---
Which no corporation is ever going to do.
---
Though it would be lovely to see Todd Howard have to say "Yeah I lied through my teeth and we pushed this game out a year too soon."
---
I can’t bring myself to get that feeling from weapon whose recoil I can not control. 
---
Pistols should take way less AP to fire then they currently do.
---
Why moo use the chemistry stations at white springs? It has all the crafting stations, a stash box, and vendors from 2 factions nearby.
---
I'm one of the people who didn't particularly like FO76 but I really have nothing against Beth. That being said, an AMA would turn into a bloodbath. I'm sure Beth knows they fucked up more than once, and an AMA would just invite this wretched hive of scum and villainy to pitchfork the shit out of them.
---
thx!
---
Yeah just another in the long ass list of things that need to be fixed. 
---
Camp Venture is good for it ballistic fiber too, as well as that Army training camp (can't remember the name).
---
Not even water purifier.  I have stopped grabbing  water from my medium purifiers because you get a lot of it while casually playing. 
---
I wanna hang you from your underwear and stuff you in a locker. Don’t know why...
---
They have, but we've (mod authors) been trying to feed them fixes for months, and they are going ignored.  
---
Hell on the [Fallout 76 Known Issues and Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/) thread it took me 15 minutes total to look up several of the problems reported and point out the fixes, but we keep being told "We are looking into it".  
---
I have trouble giving praise when they are refusing to use what we are giving them.
---
They didn't before...?

4. Healing-Over-Time long-term consumables are still broken after the hotfix.  For example, Sweet Tato Stew is supposed to heal .25HP per second for an hour but does not do any healing at all after initial ingestion-related healing. This first broke on January 29 and was not fixed by the hotfix.
---

These actually scale to your level and can drop legendaries. I know the notes are dumb but the rewards are not. Got a three star handmade from one.
---
I think there has to be some specific interaction that only affects some players. I'm all stealthed up in my gear and build, and I'm on PC, and stealth has been normal for me. Do you have the chameleon mutation? I do but I wear armor so it never kicks in.
---
yeah I've ran into people who have helped me and I've also helped people below me for all the rage and insanity in youtube and reddit the actual player base is very helpful and pleasant 
---
Grafton station
---
My son and I played ark for a while, he still plays. We has a "petting zoo" we built over a couple weeks. 
---
Ark just became the same stuff every day and I lost interest. 
---
Absolutely yes.
---
I once dropped my 3* Super Sledge, nearly had a panic attack. Thankfully it was there in a paper bag in front of a vendor.
---
I actually did drop my shielded Vault-Tec University jumpsuit, didn't notice and fast traveled away. I was lucky because it was the easiest thing in my inventory to replace.
---
Seems legit. When they determined the amount of materials needed compared to their respawn rate, server-hopping was most likely not in their calculations.
---
You can't make your equation and exclude distance, velocity and rate of fire. If you do then you are literally saying that one bullet should do the equivalent of one melee swing and that is by far the most moronic logic I have ever seen spoken on Reddit cause then when you calculate the *distance* You're so pissy about ranged builds would be the only builds people used cause you could literally obliterate a melee before they could even get in range to fight back. 
---
*Your logic is flawed, Your build is clearly flawed, Your accusations are irrelevant. Why even bother? Quit the game and quit Reddit while you're at it cause clearly you suck at both*
---
Drills should do extra damage to workshop objects, like the Wrecking Ball perk.
---
I play frequently and follow this sub, but I'm still probably well in the "filthy casual" category compared to a lot of people. And I have to say I disagree with some of your points. Nerfs and other changes (like raising cap prices for plans) just mean that the average player has to do a ton more grinding. If anything, it's only the people playing 10 hours a day that have a chance at accomplishing a lot of stuff that should be run of the mill, like being able to build their own better weapons and mods. For an average player, everything now is just even further out of reach.  
---
Example: I've spent all of the last two nights basically just grinding for caps and stimpaks, and probably have a lot more of the same. For hypothetically being able to get 1400 caps a day,  what I actually have to show for my time is pretty tragic, like up to 400 caps and about 4 total stims. Found the excavator mods at Camden vendor and then saw the price. Yeowtch. 6800 for calibrated shocks (\*with\* hard bargain). Hypothetically thats 5 days of grinding, plus whatever fast travel costs you have for vendor hopping, but at the rate I'm doing it's probably more like 3 weeks.   
---
tl;dr: As an average player, these changes really aren't helping me at all.
---
even if it was just a photo ID of us on a computer screen 
---
&gt; Make a Junk tab for C.A.M.P.s to be able to place Junk items from our inventory as C.A.M.P. decorations ~~at the cost of budget~~
---
FTFY, we need more budget not less.
---
correct, that was another secret nerf in patch 5, no ore's do anymore...
---
they nerf, nerf, nerf and dosent add anything new, strange that they dont see them self how this is going to end, never seen the servers so empty...
---
The change to a pure emphasis on grinding every aspect of end game has turned me into a dick.  I started the game meeting players outside 76 following the beta, and go in game them guns/ammo/meds. Moved into helping people level, complete quests, and drop the queen.  
---
But now there is just nothing else to do but farm. Farm mats for billets, to kill enemies that take more rounds, farm mats for stimpacks because they heal less now, and actually farm food and water because those fly down now too.  Everything endgame is just grinding.
---
But recently I found the out to make this game fun again.  If anyone pulls a gun on me, I kill them. If anyone splash damaged me with a TSE - I kill them.  If they kill me and run, I find their base and start killing it until they fight me again.  I almost always have a bounty since patch 5, and honestly, change of play style is more fun than running laps of whitesprings...I also am now spending like 50c to travel across the map to murder someone with a 5c bounty.  Bethesda has slowly converted me from a really nice guy into a monster; I am become death.
---
It was mainly to avoid ammo. It will suck when they nerf it but I'd rather respawn and be able to fight then clicking a gun with no ammo and trying to gunbash through an army. 
---
I didn’t say reduce our budget limits. I said make the item cost budget to place. Just like a wall, pot, table, or workbench does
---
Isn't that something specifically addressed in the last update?
---
I just uninstalled, but i just wanted you to know that this video makes me want to reinstall just to try the tips. GJ brother. 
---
Wouldn't it just be easier to the Chem bench in the shops below the resort? 
---
I've had the glitch happen to me yesterday. I got infected with Rad Worms and I had heard those rumors as well so I checked my pip-boy and well enough all of my mutations were buffed up by 50%. And just to clarify I haven't yet unlocked Strange in Numbers perk.
---
It clearly says I am wrong and then on the same page proves I'm right. You are literally as dumb as the urban dictionary you try to defend yourself with. Teach yourself something and then come talk to me.
---
Havent mole rats always had this issue though? They are super cheap. What about scorched and whatnot?
---
I honestly can't recall. I should have written it down or something two months ago.
---
The baby is a ***source*** of fertilizer, just be sure to change his diaper often.

It'll suck but I mainly did it to avoid ammo. I'd rather respawn and be able to fight then respawn and have to try and gunbash through an army 
---
I would Really like to see them add clutter designed by Elianora as placeable CAMP items. That girl knows how to decorate. 
---
Just because you have wide population statistics that tell you old people make up, say, 25% of the population doesn’t mean you’ll find that occurande rate if you step into an elderly care home. 
---
The stats you named lump together a very large current generation audience consuming what appeals to them with a smaller gen-x audience consuming what appeals to them. 
---
Their overall size is vastly different. 
---
Now you’ve walked into a title where the occurande rate of each audience is different to where those stats were mostly gathered, and you’re trying to say your stats apply here.
---
Doesn’t work, buddy. 
---
Ummm space engineers. Have like 3k hours. Some games are actually fun. 
---
If you haven't played it to experience it yourself then you can't really be unhappy with the games direction. Yes Bethesda did shady and unacceptable stuff multiple times, and yes the nerfs are harsh but needed.
---
.44, pump action shotgun, and lever action rifle. Complete with the cowboy hat and duster. Yee haw!
---
Hell no I want the wear and tear on the trench coat but yes the NV Vetran Ranger armor... just thinking about it gives me goosebumps... is that weird?
---
Too bad dupers have a stock of inventory to sit on that will spiral in game markets out of control for years to come.
---
It was voted best and most accurate! By illiterate people like you. There is a reason why it's called the *urban* dictionary. 
---
I think Manta Man needs a kid sidekick. The submersible kid!
---
Maybe its the stat. I have most stealth perks and gear, but my agility is 8. Stealth works fine for me (PC). Just trying to help narrow it down.
---
Oh I absolutely agree that user feedback should be a thing so that devs can improve upon their code to somewhat meet what the people want. But when someone takes to overly-criticizing a gigantic developer like Bethesda, and sits there and patronizes them like they could single-handedly do a better job... that's ignorant and there's entirely too much of that on this sub. 
---
Yea I kept thinking I was landing and bouncing off cars but when I'd check there wasn't anything there.
---
I don't think you can do a double jump from it, or at least I never could, that could be interesting as well, but i'd opt for just the high jump.
---
you're still going on about distance? check clown daddy's channel. it shows why you're wrong about the imaginary gap. not to mention weapons have range as well and get weaker the farther your are.
---
regardles, I'll reiterate: no ranged weapon can output over 17k damage, be it single shot or dps. only melee can. which makes it op. *fact*.
---
No it wouldn’t. You would still get the damage and be able to have a chance indoors being able to take enemies fast but only be able to do 5% more explosive area damage than you do now after the fact. It would bring normal guns back where she should be and the tse useable again. And to restore fatmans etc put them on a second perk that was able to bring the damage of the fat man and Grenades back to where they should be consisting that is the most iconic weapon of the game. Plus it shoots nukes. It should be op 
---
I found this useful, thanks. I've never used antibiotics, but between them and Rejuvenated, I shouldn't be getting sick anymore.
---
and now you understand why you can jump higher!
---
Thanks for your super fast reply! I'll check the mine out anyway, a little more loot never hurts for us scavengers :-) 
---
Now that I did not know! Haha going for the regular definition here 😉
---
THEY ARE ALL GREG DAMNIT! lol jk yeah that's Chad
---
Pipe weapons are low key OP, I hope they don’t get nerfed.
---
You aren’t wrong. 
---
nuuuuuu
---
they should make it so it fires 2 ammo for the 2 shots and raise the damage to make it closer to a faster firing weapon which would even out the bonus with a bit of a extras - it should also be a barrel mod +1 star
---
also explosive rounds should be a clip add on not a legend this would then need a explosive craftable ammo - this would allow a slightly higher boost to the rifle damage (say 35%) but give a pro con balance also giving people more options when crafting / modding weapons 
---
by making it so explosive and two shots have a more balanced approach that is also more accessible we expand the games immersion and fun level 
---
and for those who say - well farmings all the end game we have - FOR NOW its the end game for now I'm looking months in the future as the game is expanded 
---
Unmodded Pipe pistol and a combat knife. Gotta make it a challenge,  eh? 
---
Add “sold” to that list please.
---
Server lag made me sell my All Rise for like 60 caps.
---
Had to buy it back for 382.   -_-‘
---
@Aaxxo
---
same with ps4
---
I feel your pain. My explosive radium got nerfed into the ground. Ammo was already a grind.
---
I have an instigating super sledge with 40% power swing damage that I never used before because melee really isn't much fun. It's so much more OP than any gun I had and I don't even have many perks for a melee build.
---
After all of the time I spent allocating points towards a commando build only to have it nerfed, I don't want to devote any time towards a melee build. No way melee doesn't get a nerf next.....I saw a guy last night boasting a 2,000 damage deathclaw.
---
Yes! I do indeed good citizen!
---
had a level 70 death head rad scorpion 
---
chase me  though a turret camp at the golf club back door  when I tried to go to the fountain last night
---
dammed thing spawned on me again  when  tried to go back to get healed of bone worms 
---
so this time I led the nasty back to the turrets
---
crawed up on top  and  killed like 16 ghouls and 3 legendary s for a bunch of xp
---
and fond a weird bug that lets you repair a turret and makes it  owned 
---
need to make the area around  back door off limits to camps 
---
and stop spawning monsters and  crap at the whitesprings  fountain  its stacking the deck when you keep a player from healing 
---
this was surprisingly well thought out... good point!
---
I’ve had it a few times and server hoping fixed it for me.
---
Same, lately
---
Seems like you have to get at least 200 caps on your head and be somewhere kinda central on the map for people to notice. If you wreck up the same base twice oh, that usually gets then fired up enough to do something about it. Worst case I'll throw up a group post that says '200 cap Bounty - Come Get It'.  that tends to draw some pretty serious killers. For anyone curious, I'm not doing this to grief. I'm testing Fortress Blueprints and I need legitimate attackers. Is too bad we don't have a more benign way to induce at a bounty.
---
Just keep your big ass f@#k-off bats put away please.

Only if the next sentence starts with, "so are you just happy to see me..."

Oooof I agree.

Because the movie didn't start looping back round to the start at the 67 minute mark and then the projectionists promised to get it fixed (soon) but took months and months whilst they learnt how to act.

Shredding Minigun. That is all.
---
Yeah I noticed this straight away! My AAE Pump is breaking really fast and I havent been using it alot as I've been exploring not grinding.
---
I grabbed the skins right away. So far I have been rocking  Grognak. (Mavcop6 PS4)

You need to mass craft item to cause a server disconnect. There are a number of videos showing the technique that was patched. 
---
GET OUT OF MY HEAD DEMON!!!

Can you also do this to Digestive Goo, which is used as a component of Overdrive? It drives (heh) me mad when I go farming for it and accidentally scrap it before I can use it.

---
Nah, no holes big enough in the wasteland for this pile of junk.

Don’t think of the problem without proposing a solution at least. I heard that a different kind of currency was in the works. Maybe that will do something.?

I am pretty sure if you are on Xbox Live he would build them for anybody for free, just need the materials.

Xbox One

2) prealin

4) I wanted to scrap items at the workbench at Sutton Station. When I did that, it appeared to me that even scrap bundles were scrapped with the "scrap all" function and that most of my scrap had disappeared after that. I had about 240 in weight and 211 after that. I did not go into my stash nor did I see it on the ground.

The PSN Trophy for PS4 (Playstation 4) named "Fallout Forever" which requires a user to reach level 100 is bugged and becomes unobtainable if that player character goes in and completes the event quest "Monster Mash" inside of Watoga High School.
---
Pistols are only good for fighting your way back to a rifle.
---
Ive went to 7 so far and have 2 completed. Im close to running out and Im getting salty.
---
Yup, instead of nerfing TSE they should just make other weapons viable too. 
---
Sigh. Vault Boy/Girl turrets.
---
Hilarious - they got the good stuff, the Leather Right Leg (vs. leather armor...).
---
Is this from a quest? Not something I've encountered into yet.
---
Nope. None of them do. 
---
I've noticed a fair share of bugs, but I've also become aware (mostly from this sub) of several more things \*I just never knew were bugs\*. Many are subtle. Like plenty of perks just don't work as described or at all, and that's often difficult to prove, or even observe the effect measurably. 
---
Not sure how ALL SYSTEMS for the crashing. I know 6 people on ps4 including myself who have not crashed one time since the new patch. Perfect gameply even in nukes. Numerous other people are reporting that ps4 is fine. 
---
You're not as edgy or clever as you think
---
cause Melee needs a buff....
---
It wouldn't surprise me to learn that the durability of guns with certain affixes got a nerf. 
---
I seasoned my steak with the salt from your comments and it is quite tasty. 
---
Camp decor wise: 
---
Mainly, I want to place items I picked up on my adventures myself. I want to find and build a collection of teddy bears, not buy them all in the atomic shop. Anyone can easily do that. 
---
What makes a home, is having someone walk in and think "damn, where'd you find that clean globe?"
---
As for items: telephones, teddies, vases (with flowers or not), teapots (especially the house one), maybe dishes in general would be nice for decorating a kitchen, the little figurines you find sometimes? and pool cue and balls so it actually looks usable. :)
---
They can't even manage a stash increase after saying they would monitor it and adjust accordingly.
---
Doubt they will add a camp increase anytime in the next 6 month's.
---
And keep crying. I'm done with this convo (which is short for conversation in case your urban bible doesn't tell you) 
---
You just keep talking in circles and like any other fail troll have to resort to grammar Nazi tactics when you're out of ammo. I just got home from work so I'll be getting on fallout now and killing people with my non-OP ranged build to make my videos. *Good Day Sir*
---
I'm pretty chill with my bounty on
---
Absolutely not. For all the things that need attention, there's still an open world with plenty of things to do. Many of us who started playing before launch are still playing and regularly joining up with new players, something that couldn't have been said about ET over the same timespan.
---
I have 25 agi and I don't even need to change weapons. I never seem to be out of caution when mobs are around, when they all die; hidden.
---
Issue only presented itself the last update. Is dumb7.
---
How do you see how “empty” the servers are?
---
Replied 
---
monthly livestreams are the way to go, nice pressure release valve and  less annoying to the devs than something weekly
---
I have several bloodied explosive guns that are still op as fuck. My build is pretty solid and I can't complain.
---
Maybe make them less fragile, would be nice to fire more then 3 mussels before it breaks. 
---
I got rid of guns, ammo, armour and just use a deathclaw. So much fun! 
---
you still haven't proven me wrong.
---
&gt;You just keep talking in circles and like any other fail troll have to resort to grammar Nazi tactics
---
so you're admitting you're wrong and there's no such thing as "premadonna"?
---
Needs to happen immediately 
---
I think Bethesda needs to cater to the hardcore players (not saying the top 1%) and not the casuals.  Casuals will stop playing the game whether things get fix or not.  That's what casuals do.  They play a game for a short time then move on.  The hardcore community is what keeps these games alive.  They are the ones investing 100s of hours every month.  They are the ones buying stuff and keeping the game alive.  
---
Just take Destiny 2, for example.  It's a game that was tailor for casuals.  It sold well, but weeks after release, the player based dropped a lot (don't have the exact figures).  It's not until Bungie started to change Destiny 2 to be more like Destiny 1 that the player based started to grow again.  The changes caused the hardcore players to stick around and play the game day and day out.
---
Casual gamers are the majority.  But let's be honest, if you want your game to survive the long haul, you need to capture the hardcore players, especially for MMO-type games. 
---
Oh yay! A university! Of uneducated idiots and typical citizens who dont know what they're voting on! And have no clue what is going on in the world around them 90% of the time! 😪 I said *Good Day Sir*
---
SP CO-OP
---
No kidding, I tried a new legendary launcher on one supermutty and it took 3 missiles to kill it.  Ridiculous.   All of the tse are so weak now that it takes multiple reloads to kill non starred mobs.  
---
It’s a survivor game it shouldn’t be easy to find stuff
---
It just about hits the 1 enemy in font of us as well half the time :/
---
AOE damage would be nice, but the amount of time it would take them to make it, add it, break it, fix it and then patch it would just take far to much time and know how....neither of which fo76 has a lot off :/
---
I discovered it throughout the BoS story line. Near their former base in the middle of nothing. 
---
I can't agree enough. I recently started a pistol character and his playstyle is really fun but I can't get over how weak my weapons are. I have an exploding bloodied western revolver that is decent but I've got to always be half health if I want it to do some decent damage.
---
Love the stupidity.
---
„Don’t understand the meaning of post, you is shit lolz“
---
I'm still playing it and having fun.
---
Doesn't mean I'm going to go out of my way and defend them to a rightfully upset public.
---
Yeah, RNG is RNG. Or instead they could just make the game not suck so much.
---
I dunno, they give us updates with Inside the Vault, and while they may not feel great I would assume the content they put into those updates is as much as they're allowed to share.
---
Plus I don't know how much positive affect an AMA would have. Guaranteed it would be full of shitters being shitters, and no doubt many of the responses would be met with stupid remarks and mockery. 
---
I understand the desire but I'd have to say any kind of direct interaction between gamers and Bethesda at this point sounds like a shitshow to me.
---
You can keep waitint, Bethesda already said it isn't going free to play any time soon. *shrug*
---
Interesting. Guess I'll check out West-Tek soon. 
---
I found one on the vendorbot at harpers ferry yesterday post patch
---
I think this should be the guiding design principle:
---
* When you are at level 50 with a level 50 missile launcher shooting a level 50 super mutant and score a direct hit in the chest, the mutant should explode into a fine mist, sending body parts in every direction.
---
   * What happens now is that maybe 5-10% of the mutants health is lost and it doesn't even flinch.
---
* I shouldn't need a perk for the above to happen. A rocket launcher should blow things up even if I only know how to point it somewhere and press the red button.
---
* Perk cards should maybe
---
   * Improve the AoE damage radius for hitting nearby targets
---
   * Improve the AoE damage amount to nearby targets in that radius
---
   * More accurate/aggressive tracking
---
   * Option for rockets to explode when proximity to target is detected instead of just flying past. (similar to the GRENADES AND HORSHOES item perk in Destiny)
---
You can decide to scale up/down the damage based on level, but when all is equal, missile launcher should end things.
---
At the end of the day, a missile launcher is a situational weapon, I am not going to perk into it. The ammo is too heavy for it to be worth the effort. Make the ammo rarer, keep it heavy, but make it mean something if I bother to lug the ammo around.
---
Is probably talking about the refire rate.  Took 30 sec to fire first round, ~10 sec per shot at 4 shots when I experimented with it.  Extra guns just fired them in series one at a time with same rate.  
---
Said they'd fix it soon as well....more likely FTP before its fixed though :/
---
Just sayin...
---
I’m just waiting on the next content add-on. Most likely with the vaults, but I’m hoping on a new boss
---
Charleston and sutton, look there. It is extemely expensive though.
---
Hm. I’ll try that when I get home, see if it affects me too. What mutations?

They don't have the balls or the time to do so
---
You are heavily misinformed if you think this is anything close to a mobile game.....
---
Stick to your iPhone.
---
Yeah yeah, I'll believe it when I see it. Just saying.
---
I shouldn’t feel like I am doing chores.
---
Good luck with that lol. I've played a few unpopular games and livestreams tend to be bad.
---
you already have the ability to respec and finding anything you need for any build is easy
---
so let me get this straight, urban dictionary isn't good enough, a professor from an university isn't good enough, so just what is good enough?

Hm, what region is that? Can't find that location in the wiki.

---
I've been saving my caps. So I have enough. I've just been trying to find it. I just got on, like 20 minutes ago for he first time since the last patch. So I'm just looking around for it. I'll check it out. 
---
Someone probably watched a random zombie movie and thought it was nifty.
---
You must not have downloaded the multiplayer expansion for E.T. then, speak for yourself.
---
/u/lonevaultwanderer , /u/ladydevann - Could one of you guys please look into this a little? 
---
I don't seem to be the only one experiencing this, and it makes it quite hard to earn xp when enemies just die before you can reach them.
---
That's what the benches are there for.  Sit down, take a load off, and wait your turn.  Had a guy punching me after a few seconds so I decided it'd be a great time for a bathroom break. 
---
What do you want, live decision making and commitments?
---
That doesn't happen, wake up please. xD
---
Bet it was Todd, or some other shareholder that just floated through the office one day pecking the dev's head about some stupid drill his kid wants in the game daddy makes.
---
That's why its useless and does all of 12 damage or whatever it is :/
---
Ah, but which one of these is the bug?
---
* How much damage the enemy ends up taking.  It could be intentional that enemies are vulnerable to sneak attacks only because they let down their guard (don’t see any players) not because they don’t know where the attack is coming from (don’t see you).
---
* The client makes a guess (shows gray damage) and then has to be corrected by the server (the gray damage gets healed instead of taken off), so the bug is that the client is making wrong guesses.
---
I get that it is a survivor game, but the tediousness in this game is ramped to such a high degree that it is painstakingly dreadful.
---
The Bess was .75 cal but they used .69 balls because the powder would foul the barrel, making it hard to load, after a few shots.
---
Just look for this bot named Pee-Wee
---
Its 2 damage btw
---
E.T. was so bad, some argue it had an industry harming impact. In 2019 a bad game can just be a bad game, and ideally have some lessons learned for other devs.
---
E.T. was also locked in time, BGS gets to respond to feedback and update FO76. Even No Man's Sky got better over time.
---
I relate with the disappointment, but wouldn't compare to E.T.
---
No. That's silly. You're not going to melt down glass and make a bottle. But after you drink a beer or similar bottle, it should turn into an empty bottle, absolutely. 
---
Provide some links to those posts and shut this false claim down?
---
Think for yourself. Don't use others' opinions as fact. You should probably play the game. You'll be pleasantly surprised. Especially if you have the notion that it is anything like a mobile game.
---
We have, they never respond.
---
4 hours a week for me lol.  I could probably find time to play, but I like my sleep.  I spend more time reading and watching people play games than I actually play.  Tis the life of adulthood.
---
They always have more to lose. xD
---
Yeah no.... I‘ve seen that post and your comment. You simply did not understand what the OP of the other post was talking about... sorry bro. (Btw the other post is 8-10 posts above this one at the moment when sorting by new)
---
I played the game for a hundred hours, i'm not even close to my 3rd buy in the atom shop, this is bullshit
---
Shot 3 vertibirds down with one once.  I think in only cost 1k steel...
---
Ooooooooh yeah.
---
At first, I was like "Oh nice, handcuffs. Could get screws." then I took a good long look at everything else in the room and went "It's always the rich guys that are into the kinky stuff, isn't it?"
---
Someone's a bit angry. Deep breaths, friend. In the end, it's just a videogame.
---
Plausible, except I think they fixed the radworms issue as it wasn't retaining bonuses for me last night. 
---
That's what I said 3 patches ago about duping and server stability :/
---
Is it really that bad? I adored that perk when I used to regularly play, but I haven't tried the new update yet
---
Not in game, i knew there was a 2 though ; )
---
LOL no I don’t. I am level 225. Do you know how hard it is to level right now? I have like 30 something points to move around for my optimal build. Do you know how long it takes for me to level up on this game, while balancing ammo depletion, weapon and armor repairs, inventory space, WHILE trying to maintain a fun and engaging experience? Pretty fucking hard. This game is dreadful in its current state.
---
Oh god yes,Ive been wishing for something like this since launch, I can't tell you how many times I've had to go back to the NukaCola bunker cause I accidentally scrapped my "bottle &amp; cappy" outfit  
---
I don't think gaming is any different from watching tv or browsing the web on your free time.  I think gaming is actually more beneficial.
---
What do you mean bulldozer? There is no bulldozer. also, snapping is just as bad because it was copied right out of Fallout 4. It's the exact same thing! What do you mean snapping is better? I had to remove the entire roof of my house to put on a different type of wall after I got the brick building set because it said that it was floating. All I did was removed the wooden wall. Outrageous
---
if you nerf stuff and you no longer like the build or need to change it that should not be our fault. we should get a respect because having to level up 30 times to respect something and then they nerf that is bs
---
A powder gun can do more damage than a nuke. 
---
\*Hits yao guai with nuke\* 
---
\*Barely does damage\*
---
\*Shoots yao guai with black powder rifle\*
---
\*Takes half of his health\*
---
Hmmm..
---
They did. My camp was placed by a few veins for that very reason. 
---
This would be pure perfection 👍🤘
---
Hey Swoftz, just providing visibility to our recent known issues post, but in there we mention that we are looking into power armor/weapons renaming as an option for an update later in the year.
---
Sure, As soon as you admit you are wrong and melee builds Aren't OP. 
---
Not sure if trolling...
---
OP thank you for this! Alot of the complaints etc. About TSE and whatnot go right over my head!  I definitely play casually and have only just reached lvl 31. I find the game to be more enjoyable when exploring new areas not sure if what I'm packing will be sufficient to deal damage to what I may encounter.. 
---
well yeah, that's because they've pretty much abandoned the game. But at the very least, settlements would be a lot more fun if they actually worked differently and they reduced the issues with clipping and snapping. But they made no change since the last game
---
I am honestly awaiting announcements of new quests and such. and the timeline for actual new content
---
and then it land and you oneshoot it. yeah, we get it. your plank with nails taped in is stronger than my nuclear catapult. no need to rub it in.
---
Ark ported to phone alright, multiplayer is shitty but the single player runs fine. 
---
This would probably be better as a phone game as well tbh it might get some love of Bethesda that way and get a decent team of devs working on it
---
Me too. I actually quit when it first came out because of it too. I was literally stuck near the top of the world. I crashed there, and whenever I would log back in, I’d crash as soon as I did anything.
---
My friend eventually talked me into coming back after a patch a few weeks ago, and I’ve had zero problems since. Not even a single disconnect
---
He will probably switch to laser weapons.
---
Because you surely know what tools they are using. If you understand regression testing then you wouldn't be making comments like that. For all we know the bobby pin weight regression was a combination of multiple factors.
---
I'm a casual player who hates all the issues with this game. However, I understand the process of development and how issues arise. That's why I'm much more understanding than those who think that there is 
---
a 100% foolproof method to prevent bugs and regressions from occurring.
---
How cynical of me.
---
Straight away we'd get posts here, YouTube clickbait and web articles saying "*Bethesda steals modders work and profits on it!!*". They probably want to avoid using somebody else's work and want to fix it themselves. That said, I bet they read things like your fix and it does help (so please keep at it!).
---
This is true. Thanks for the correction.
---
and was made even more useless with the flawed TS(e) Rebalance....
---
Yep but small in comparison to everything else that is messed up abt the game
---
 Youre using the internet wrong
---
Gotta love it when Fanbois add that context themselves hey :)
---
There was another guy a day or two ago that had the same thing happen. In his plea for them to unban him he said he has never duped except for the one time he duped. 
---
You can go through my comments to see that one. Nobody else caught it in that thread
---
But what if they scan the game files for any files that aren't already there and ban you for it? While I doubt they would do that, it is the dumbest thing to do so, based on their past decisions with 76, is the one they're probably gonna choose. 
---
Exacta-fucking-lootly. We take all this time to build our builds to these weapons, they nerf them into the ground to be only shadows of what they used to be, nerf the ability to level and increase how hard it is to obtain ammo and are like, okay now, have fun trying to unfuck yourself. Absolutely absurd. I cannot get how people can defend this game in doing so.
---
Well that makes no fucking sense at all.  The weapon shouldn’t care if I hit the target or not.  Will have to see.  Can also do the test out in the wild with the same approach. 
---
Not everyone builds guns.
---
Some people have pack mule characters that they never make weapons with.
---
Literally said I don’t see any words, actions or, visuals to even remotely indicate that they’re “raiders”. If you’re just doing it to mess up someone’s day grow a pair and own it. 
---
They said it wont go FTP.
---
So I guess it gets fixed or gets turned off :P
---
This is rage inducing in the moment. It hilarious when you watch someone else chase one down a mountain.
---
I don't really think this is true.  
---
They're not even able to fix the all problems that they've created.  Most of the bugs and the bug fixes have been problems unique to fo76.  The general jankiness of a typical creation engine game is there, but they've got a mountain of more pressing stuff to get through first.
---
Given their backlog as well as some experience on the subject, I also really doubt they're digging deep and coming up with holistic fixes to underlying problems.  When everything is on fire and everyone's yelling at you, you break out the duct tape and just try to get everything mostly working again.  You're not fixing the underlying system, you're creating more technical debt that you'll have to pay off later.  To be clear, this is not quite their fault (beyond releasing such a buggy game at all) - when you're trying to fix so many issues so quickly you don't have the luxury to look too closely at them.
---
What major Creation Engine bugs have they fixed, anyway?  Can you even name one?  
---
never, because they stated it will not go F2P after the first huge rumors that came from literally nowhere started.
---
Nah he's to busy now
---
I love the game! I have experienced frequent crashes but since the last patch not one yet. Most other "issues" that I originally thought was a glitch turned out to be user error. 
---
You know what.
---
Can you fast travel out the vault to a friend?
---
That would sidestep the vault trophy.
---
Pistols aren't viable at Endgame also 
---
**Atom store outfits having issues:** Rose dress kicks up in the back, displaying granny panties for all the world to see. Wouldn't be that much of an issue if it was temporary exposure but nope. Tattered skirt doesn't seem to share the same issue.
---
Visual issues with the silver shroud outfit. seems like the underarmor might be causing the glitch (not positive) there are times you look like scarecrow and the outfit is in tatters, and other times it looks as advertised.
---
I think it's ok that the smallest, lightest, cheapest weapons are outclassed by the heaviest, most expensive ones.
---
At level 80 the only weapons I use are a vampire's walking cane (158 dmg), a vampire's western revolver (maybe 135, can't remember), and an armor-piercing 10mm pistol (maybe 40-50-ish).
---
The revolver lacks penetration but the [mitigation formula](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#Fallout_4) is more forgiving of high damage-per-bullet weapons, assuming 76 uses the same formula as FO4.
---
I been have been killing mobs with a single bullet including other Dwellers. V.A.T.S with crit boosts have always been a thing in the fallout series. No sneak needed bonuses 
---
 For me it changed very little. I got a low level one shot exploder shotgun that just murdered everything. I was embarrassed to use it so I very seldom did.
---
 So the game is about the same for those of us who did not take the OP train. At your level you hardly need to.
---
*waves hands*
---
I'm with you on the workshops. I've only played around with them one time (Tyler County Dirt Track, not the best one I know, but I enjoy the forest) and after I finally had it set up the way I wanted, I disconnected and haven't tried again. It's pretty demoralizing to the players when they're too paranoid to play the game, because Bethesda can't manage to figure out stable servers.
---
I would LOVE a way to display power armor permanently without it taking up stash space. I'd be perfectly fine with it taking up C.A.M.P. space instead.
---
I roll with a TSE Gauss Rifle (suppressed), AA Shishkebab and AA Combat Knife. :)
---
I have Calibrated shocks and will get 550 if I load in whilst wearing the Excavator!
---
Wait. You were making witch costumes, and then scrapping them to sell to vendors?
---
Why would you need to craft them to scrap them to sell them?
---
I definitely saw some odd stuff last night. I'm usually baseline about 245 / 345 with Excavator PA. So with the log-in bug sometimes its 445. Last night for a while I was sitting at 400 even. Even if it had stacked my deep-pocketed armor and counting possible buffs, I think the max I could conceivably get is about 370. Then it went back to normal after a bit.
---
Hit level 50 a few days ago, still don't have the Reclamation Day achievement. I'm still in the vault, hooked up to a chair Matrix-style, exploring Appalachia in my dreams and learning some sweet kung fu
---
Just dont wear a MMLFGA hat around scorched - it triggers them.
---
If you played beta you don’t get the trophy for leaving the vault. I had to create a 2nd character just for the trophy.
---
Shhhhhh dont let Bethesda know about my super fast gatling.
---
25% fire rate and martial artist 3 means I can crank the bitch like a minigun
---
It just works
---
You don’t have time to tweet when you’re hiding in your ivory tower counting all your money
---
Check his post history. I took screenshot in case he ninja’d it. 
---
Wouldn’t you have then left the vault and be eligible for the trophy?
---
I'd let us display any item in our inventory, and just count it in our stash allotment. I'd love to be able to "park" my power armor. or have a bobblehead display like fo4...
---
I wish that long line of cars near the WS golf course could be chain reacted
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Lever action and Handmade with the appropriate perks still easily kill level 68 mutants. One shot with the lever action is sneaking, 3 shots (or one and a headshot) not sneaking. Handmade clearly takes more but with a few going to the head its not even a full clip. Sure you have to actually aim instead of just shooting near them with explosive weapons. 
---
I mean, to play devils advocate, Fallout 4 came out November 2015, the first dlc (automaton) was March, and I think Far Harbor was May.
---
So as long as we see some content by March its par for the course for DLC releases.
---
That's the Voice of Set.
---
Right. My bad, thanks for the clarification. 
---
I’ve had the vendor spawn multiple times when a camp was next to Charleston if the house was on the northeast corner of the pond but never had it spawn if the camp was closer than that. 
---
JESUS ALLMIGHTY. I never even put up that much turrets when I even farm nor build a big apartment building like this.
---
Land mine
---
No.  All things considered ET was not as bad as its reputation.
---
First off, ET was not responsible for the gaming crash.  Atari was...ET was just one of last high profile game before the crash.
---
Second, ET was created by one person... ONE PERSON...and he was given something like 8 weeks to create the game and he did it.
---
Third, the game sold well, but the hype train lead retailers to order way more copies than they should have.
---
Just mods being accidentally scrapped. Op is saying should be expanded to more things. 
---
Damn shame.
---
Good thing I'm not a "fanboi", then. Just a normal guy that finds constant crying about videogames on the Internet quite childish.
---
Instigating lever action and an instigating button with +40% power attack damage
---
Digging the right up dude. 👍 
---
It's all about the pros and the cons.
---
We can talk about that when we're also talking about player-made expansions for a developer-abandoned FO76.
---
Nooooooo!  You've done it now. XD
---
There's one thing devs do *constantly* when balancing multiplayer games, across the entire industry, that I just don't understand:
---
When one thing is too strong, they nerf *everything* related to why that thing is strong.  The end result is a thing that's too weak.
---
It plays out exactly the same every time.  Rather than iteratively addressing each of the components and seeing how that changes the final result, they just smash it into little tiny pieces.
---
They could have easily tweaked any *one* number related to TSE and waited to see how that would look.  Instead they heavily nerfed two shot, explosive, *and* the perk.
---
It's just bad design, and it's not limited to Bethesda.  I don't get why that approach is so common.
---
My husband and I play together on ps4 (seperate consols off the same internet connection). Earlier this week he got blue screened over 20 times in 1 day. Same with 2 of our team mates. I had no disconnects at all but I did get a spaghetti dog for the 1st time. I've had a relatively bug free game thus far and I'm sitting at over 350 hours. By relatively bug free I mean only a few small annoyances. Nothing game breaking for me. I guess I've been lucky. 
---
Can these Free to play posts keep getting deleted please, Bethesda has already denied these stupid rumors, they're just spam now.
---
Except if it's offered freely...  
---
#feelsbadman
---
Nah and it's not NMS levels of controversy either. It's more like ESO levels of bad
---
why not spoilable stuff too, but if you leave it out you'll see the spoiled remains laying around your camp. then you would have to clean it up... Oh, the immersion!
---
Was hunting for Legendarys earlier at the steakhouse near RobCo. I'm 9/9 rifle perks, 2/3 tank killer, 3/3 Bloody Mess, using Handmade rifle.
---
Not one of the super mutants took more than 5 shots to the head to take down. No sneak, no crit. I'm not trying to brag, just not really sure of the weakness you're reffering to?
---
I'm a pure melee-build, but I carry around a rifle just for scorchbeasts so I can feel like I'm doing something when they won't land.
---
https://i.imgur.com/TS7GnM0.png
---
Can't we just call them Michael Moore's
---
 I love carving them up with the Blade of Bastet, its just fun. ;)
---
And so the enemy has discovered healing Armor and how to house stimpacks.....makes it more realistic
---
I've level 49 with mine, and OP is pretty much completely right. Now, I only invested the 3 perk points for 30% damage instead of the 9 perk points for 60%, but still, it's not great. I can definitely beat up on some like level 40 stuff, but the whitespring nuke ghouls? I'm basically just tagging them for others. It's rough. I started taking some heavy gun perk so at least I could find something to shoot the SB queen with. 
---
The caps should be refunded if you stay to the end of the event - win or lose.
---
&gt; the more of a message will be sent.
---
"Hmm, says right here everyone who abruptly stopped playing the game immediately uninstalled and no one who stopped playing is keeping it installed for even a little bit. What could this mean?"
---
"Isn't it obvious? They really need that HD space so much they stop playing the game and uninstall just to free it up. Clearly our former players are ridiculously desperate for HD space. Perhaps we should try to partner with HD/SSD manufacturers to offer any player with a Fallout 76 account discounted storage devices since that's exactly what they're telling us they want."
---
Thanks.  Kind of confirms what I thought.  Vendor change removed it. :(
---
Moving forward, his next project is 16 times the size with endless amounts of detail and an all new lighting system never before seen 
---
It doesn't bug out every time rad worms goes away but if it does, yes, logging out and back in appears to fix it.
---
Why so they can sit and lie to us more?
---
It went free to play yesterday, didn't you see the tweet from Bill Gates.
---
Don't take any media too seriously. They're often concentrating on raising their own profile.
---
I'ed make you 2 for 4000 Caps. So that I can buy my self Plan: T-51b Calibrated Shocks
---
It's not going free to play but they will continue to add expansions for free so the games going to be getting more content which will make up for the price.
---
Can you please make the whitesprings robots ignore unintentional damage with pacifist? I had to evacuate the area multiple times because of a stray bullet hitting a Mr handy, turning all robots hostile. Being chased by a horde of sentries and assaultrons while you're just trying to bash some ghouls gets annoying pretty fast.
---
i'm logging on right now, my username is fordhamae
---
With as many bugs the game has/had....
---
Isn't it plausible?
---
Agreed, I just thought it was. Thanks.
---
Same here. The only lockups was the pip boy thing.
---
Sitting in the corner under the shower, tilting... „It just works, it just works, it just works...“
---
Wait, you can still dupe? I thought that was fixed. 
---
absolutely not. which other legendary mod comes even close to +50% dmg??? it is still one of the best legendary mods. maybe instead of asking for a two-shot buff ask for a buff to ranged weapons in general.
---
Ah okies so fanatical then....sounds like a Bethesda fanboi's mo tbh but hey ho :P
---
Maybe worth it, but completely annoying, you travel to the start of the event and there is nothing there and you then  get 4 circles across the current map area to go to, to search for the horde, I don't bother any more, just too annoying and silly.
---
You guys are seriously stepping it up in the past few days. We’ve had a lot of communication, more than you had between the beta and actual game release. With that said, there is still a lot of damage control to be done to make Fallout 76 not COMPLETELY tank. But there is an attempt being made  
---
This is how broken your game is my lvl 17 toon can out damage a lvl 167 toon .with my lvl 10 44 .they were using a lvl 50 two shot none explosive 10mm .my 44 were killing lvl 42 with two shots it took him 10 to 15 shots to do the same damage.this is way to funny .good job 
---
My title asks if anyone is waiting on F2P . I’m not asserting FO76 will go F2P; I’m wondering who is on the same boat as me . I love fallout but I’m waiting . Wondering if anyone feels the same 
---
It was unfixed in the latest patch. I haven’t seen concrete proof yet but everyone’s talking about it. 
---
Oh joy... 
---
I wanna see if anyone else is waiting for it like I am don’t be so negative 
---
Kind of what I was thinking too. So many quests have such little reward For how much running around they involve. 
---
C'mon, you really still believe Bethesda....
---
Is there any chat about increasing the yeild received from crafting fuel ammunition for the flamethrower? I love using it when I can,but it seems it would take me a lot of time to gather enough resources to yeild a viable amount of ammo for it.
---
+1 Scrolled down to find this comment, wasn't disappointed. 
---
People like to dramatize things happening in the game because it sounds juicier.
---
It's not really a war, just a problem some games have. Eventually Bethesda will fix the exploits and ban the dupers, and the "economy" will settle.
---
It's already relatively settled, dupers don't dupe for caps anymore unless they're feeling generous. It's all monetary now. Like if you dupe and haven't moved onto cash what is you doing bby
---
Considering..... looking at all the posts here and all the youtube videos it could be just me and you maybe a couple more playing, they can make it massive now and let all legendaries be guaranteed ***...... i love this game 
---
Guys, i know you care, but really. We cant be just making post anymore. If we really want to make a change happen we need to band together. 1,000 people? Nahh aint gonna change nothin. 20,000 they might cinsider it. But with the 171,000 people on this sub we can make a diffrence. 
---
Its simple really, when you make a post ask for people to stand with you. Have them copy your post txt.. however you do that on moble i dont know. And send it to EVERY community rep from bethesda. We can tackle one issue at a time. Just make sure your calling them out to respond. Publicly. On reditt. Then and only then, when they recieve LITERALLY thousands of messages all saying THE EXACT SAME THING. We will get enough of a chance to make changes happen.
---
Now this isnt an easy idea, it takes planning. Your first hurdle is to open a discussion regarding one specific issue. We all must diberate what we are seeing, and we all must speak our minds on what us fair and how far changes should go. After this is done. One person will post with the ultimate descision we made, and we all copy amd send it off.
---
Its far fetched, but i would be morified to log in one day and find literally thousands of messages in my inbox... its be scary and id have to listen. And because its kind of their job, theyd have to respond. 
---
Lastly if we all speak with one voice, if we all say the same thing we cant be set aside. We can demand and actually get work to be done right.
---
Tho we should leave TSE alone for a while to make sure people give up on them before allowing them to be buffed properly and reasonably since there are FAR too many floating around these days.
---
Did you put my post through a translator and back through to English? Haha
---
Did he lie about the game tho? Its exactly as he said it would be more or less.
---
[Mein Führer is not amused.](https://i.imgur.com/gMdtU0S.png)
---
Agreed.  There would be more of a sense of world rebuilding if everyone in the world receives the rewards.  If there were a greater reward server wide for more people involved in a given event it may add incentive for individuals to work together as a team more often.
---
Then play something else. Games nerf and buff thinblgs all the time. People are always mad about them. If you're that mad and the game has become that unenjoyable then just don't play it. 
---
Also, respecs are in the game already? Unless they removed them since I played last. 
---
Nope. The last patch apparently brought some of them back. 
---
I don't know which ones work. I don't dupe. 
---
All I know is that people are now offering duping services right now, and hunters long coats and mutation serum RECIPES both cost 100-200 caps each....
---
They were worth way more last week. It seems someone has duped the shit out of them since the last patch. 
---
I think you can go back to the mansion and make it again, mate.
---
They remind me of [Han Solo's blaster](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Han%27s_heavy_blaster_pistol), made from an antique [Mauser C96](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauser_C96) (96 as in 1896) with a bunch of random junk added to it.
---
Right but it helps to post links for the lazy disbelievers.
---
Oh was looking into that last night, im sure i have it learned but cant find in my build menu, what vendor sells them?
---
I played a lot of AAA games. Not on console, but on PC. And I played multiplayer when I was a student and time did not matter. 
---
Now I just can\`t play 3 or 4 hours in one piece. I still play 10, 20 hours a week. So games like Witcher or even Minecraft (I played A LOT with my little daughter on our private server) are not a problem. Also Ark, X3, 7D2d, etc.
---
I have several hundred hours in Elder Scrolls and Fallout games.  I am / maybe "was" what you could call a Bethesda Fanboy starting with the first Elder Scrolls games and FO3. I blindly preordered FO4, Skyrim and the DLCs and did not regret it for a single minute. And yes, I preordered FO76 and I love the detailed world and the storytelling.
---
But I do not play at the moment. Partly because of the problems I mentioned above, partly because I just get more fun playing X4 and Alpha 17 of 7D2D at the moment.
---
But I read on reddit about FO76. And most of the things I read here is just not what I expected from a Fallout Game. 
---
Every time I try to play again, I log in and start exploring. But then I have to pause and after that I just start X4 or 7D2D and play it for the rest of the evening or weekend.
---
I know, probably it just "is not for me"....
---
And because of that I asked Bethesda if they really wanted to make a game that is not for people like me. 
---
I have yet to find the union hat, we found union uniform plans first or second time we saw him. If it helps I've only ever found him at a house unmarked on the map, but it's down the 59, just a little south of Slocum's Joe. He's there pretty often actually. I just got a civil war era dress plan from him right now. He also always has black powder weapons on him.
---
Dang, I'm saving up 20k to buy a recipe and they're selling for 200. 
---
Sneak attacks, regardless of where the enemy gets attacks from should do the extra damage depending on the perk state you have. It shouldnt be "it takes this much damage but since its under attack from other people its is expecting damage from other sources as well." That makes no sense and makes the perk worthless to the person using it. To put it in a real situation, if someone is in a fight and someone comes in from the side and sucker punched them, they will probably get knocked the hell out. Same case with a sneak attack from another player. That damage needs to still count and not get kicked back to a non-sneak attack damage or less in some cases. 
---
I wish I would've kept my explosive armor penetrating pipe rifle
---
If I could express some feedback, just start with the subreddit. The Livestream chat feed would just be an overwhelming negative responses from people who just hate on the game.
---
Here, you have a little more control with poor behavior/negative comments that have no constructive value to the AMA.
---
If not the AMA, simply upload a video. Don't be afraid to take a light hearted jab at Fallout 76, much like how the Skyrim for Alexa came to be. Some lighthearted humor paired with honest self reflection from the 76 team could make a huge impression going forward.
---
Of course, that's only the first step, trying to connect with the players. Action needs to follow up.
---
All the best
---
Might sound mean but this type of absolutely terrible suggestions is why Bethesda should sometimes not hear to the community. 
---
That's a strange decision
---
As someone who uses fatman's, missle launchers, grenade launchers auto or manual i got to say a couple things. With over 630 hours played while using these weapons regularly i think my input should be considered. 
---
If you dont have the following your going to have a bad time:
---
\-Bear Arms
---
\-Ordnance Express 
---
\-Demo Expert Maxed 
---
Extras not required but help tremendously:
---
\-Stabilized (if you use power armor) 
---
\-One Man Army
---
\-Adrenaline Reaction mutation
---
\-Marsupial Mutation 
---
\-Super Duper for creating more Ammo 
---
\-Damage boosting Chems
---
\-Utilizing stealth 2.0x bonus 
---
I keep hearing people complain about the weight of the weapons and ammo but they refuse to slot the perks to use them. I can carry over 4 missle launchers and 4 fatmans for like 18 pounds. That is literally nothing. Then i can carry like 50 missles and 20 fatmans with ease. These perks are a must for the play-style and people assume you can forgo them. 
---
Now regarding durability, i think this is a none issue since they all weight next to nothing. Just bring multiple and your good to go. Repair them with weapon artisan as well.
---
Ammo is also very easy to craft in my opinion and takes no time at all to get a mass amount.  
---
The damage is pretty high once you get bloodied or anti armor variants and use the "Extras" ive listed. 
---
The only changes i would consider are the following: 
---
\-Increase base damage of all explosive weapons (none legendary perk related) by 40% to compensate for the lost damage after the TSE nerf. This will also assist those without legendary explosive weapons. 
---
\-Make bear arms effect the Auto Grenade Launcher. 
---
\-Increase weight of mini nukes to 8 pounds (an increase am i crazy?...nope slot ordnance express please). In my opinion Mini Nukes are very overpowered. I can one shot level 91 death claws with my Bloodied Fatman. 
---
In general the damage is there but you need a min/max'd setup. Players also forget these weapons provide massive AoE. They cant beat single target weapons from a damage perspective. 
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
They are offering duping services for caps, and some are giving away the hundreds of newly duped items to everyone. 
---
They are losing interest in the game, and are doing as much damage as they can before leaving. 
---
And Bethesda is a pretty close second tbh. 
---
I love my pistols. They do need work but its not that bad really. I use 1 point of adrenaline and 2 gun fu. after killing 1 mob the rest are 1 shot even in a situation where its a heavy armor enemy using a vats crit build with it you are doin insane damage. I pretty much crit every other shot at least. I use ps4 so im holding triangle down permanently .I use a quad western revolver with vats crit modifiers as my main but an AA pistol would be sweet still looking.
---
I am dydamas
---
Please don't read this as me mansplaining/dumbsplaining the election system. I assume that not every reader is American, not every reader is over 18, not every American reader over 18 is a voter.  
---
What you're asking (why all the voting locations?) is the same as asking "Why all the carved and plastic pumpkins on porches?"). The bombs dropped on 10/23/2077. Not only was that eight days before Halloween, it was a few days more before election day.
---
In the U.S. elections are held on the first Tuesday in November. The presidential elections are every four years, the national Senate elections are every six years (each state gets two senators, who aren't elected the same year), and the House of Representatives are elected every two years.  
---
With local and state offices the rules for when their elections are held are set at the state, county or local levels, depending on state constitutions and the like. In places where elections are considered an onerous expense (read: states with no income tax, very often the "right to work" states)  the elections are typically held only in even year numbers. In other states (read: states up north with income tax, they might hold certain elections like mayor, attorney general, state supreme court, city/town council in odd years). This means holding elections when the public isn't already voting for representatives and president and/or senators.  
---
This is the first game in the Fallout series where I've seen voting locations. I find this interesting because despite West Virginia being a Union state during the Civil War, it is generally considered a southern state. I suppose that Boston not holding elections in 2077 for mayor or for governor of the Commonwealth in an odd year (nor any other local offices) is probably an example of the historical divergence. OTOH, West Virginia almost certainly isn't a Right to Work state, given the once-great power that the miners' unions once held there.
---
It is Bethesda..  
---
Okay, whatever makes you feel better, man!
---
Time to play Warframe until next patch or two
---
See what happens then
---
I enjoyed the game. But fuck me is Fallout going in a bad direction...
---
&gt; I had to remove the entire roof of my house to put on a different type of wall after I got the brick building set because it said that it was floating. 
---
Oh, that reminds me. Another improved feature is you can replace an existing structure in place with a like one. In your specific case you didn't need to remove the roof. You just use replace and choose a new wall.
---
I think you need to learn the new camp system. It's obvious that you're ignorant of some of its features, bulldozer included.
---
Anyone know where the small numbers and letters are?
---
You're welcome. 
---
PS. Worm Boosted Marsupial is fun.
---
 [**u/LoneVaultWanderer**](https://www.reddit.com/user/LoneVaultWanderer/)  \- Will the TSE orientated nerfs be altered in the future? Even if it was just the rollback on the explosive bullet damage. Melee really the only viable build to roll on against the SBQ, and probably too good now as a result of this.   
---
For constructive criticism in general, the nerf on TSE could have maybe had a lesser nerf (eg. 20/25%) on both to make it less reliant to certain players and hopefully keep it in line with Melee builds for PvE (I can understand with two shot mostly getting a nerf). Also,for PvP, most legendary effects should be disabled, of course not PvP related weapon effects and armour effects, as it is in Fo76 for PvP situations. (People will probably not like my personal opinion on TSE, but they've pretty much been ruined.
---
For passive mode changes, the Hunter/Hunted mode should be the only way that players can participate in PvP battles (except Versus events) to avoid High level grievers on low level players. This should apply to C.A.M.P buildings as well to avoid the same problem (in some C.A.M.P placements, this could differ, though might be rare).
---
Regarding stash, could we do something like separating junk scrap and other items?
---
For example, 400lb - 600lb for non junk scrap items (unique items) and junk scrap should be just a item with a string of numbers and should not hugely impact the server whatever the number behind that is and hopefully can hoard like 500-1000 of each junk scrap?
---
&gt;I can't kill every enemy in the game on a whim! This means the game is not fun, it's just work!
---
Jesus what a fucking whiner
---
For what it’s worth, a level 45 ski sword with skates or metallic shards (Black Diamond also comes with STR+1) does more damage - just doesn’t have the armor piercing traits
---
An even better question is why is it still called Two Shot and not "One and a Quarter Shot"?
---
On Xbox, yes. 
---
They seem to still be worth more on PC. 
---
A week or so ago on xbox, recipes for serums went for 1-1.5k if you knew who to ask. 
---
Since the last patch, they have tanked in price again. 
---
One thing is to just have a look at the map, yes, they could be "hiding / sneaking" but it was never like this before, another ting is how often there are nuke lunches, a month back the nukes where doping like flies all the time, to find one now i must serve hop or lunch one myself...
---
Have played since first possible hour, but it's like ther is no anymore to do, was hoping they would add new stuff faster, and not just use all their manpower on nerfing (and few bugs) :/
---
Nah it's not because they're losing interest, it's because they know the dupe fun is almost over. Wouldn't chalk it up to much else
---
And I’m saving in game caps to buy one serum from Modus.. I’m so dumb 😢
---
Sorry I meant the list is missing this stuff. I had her craft me an extra in case I got tired of my union one, but I sold it. It just looked like I was wearing one of Hillary Clinton's pantsuits. The union uniform makes me look like an adventurer. 
---
We have invented moderation a while back you know all
---
The platforms to do this support it. 
---
This is a red herring. 
---
" We're aware \_\_\_\_\_ is broken, we're looking at remediating it in the future"
---
OK fair enough. So it's the most powerful ledge effect for Fat Man then
---
Mutations aren't working. Marsupial for example is not working. Strange in numbers unequipped, no change. Re-equipped, no change. Strange in numbers is not being shared, not on a team. 
---
I like the idea, I'm always crafting 50 cal ammo which I don't need but other people do 
---
I like to think that somehow the residents of West Virginia post-war have been drafted into some sort of eternal Clown-Wendigo War.
---
Really? Hmm... I'll take a look after work, here's hoping I still have the garb thing 
---
Bwahaha I think I will. And you can see a shit ton of others (what little were left) doing the same. I am asking for change in support of the consumer, but I guess if you like being fucked in the ass by bethesda, be my guest. From reading your post though it doesn’t seem like you’ve played much on the last patch. Spend a few hours and get back to me.
---
When I say respec (and others) we are referring to a total respec of all your points.
---
Wouldn't this make it easier to report dupers?
---
it happened to me too (PS4). I have absolutely no idea what caused it but I think it had to do with a glitch in the armor legendary mod that gives you a stealth field when hit melee. It is a complete random guess but is the only thing in my build that might give me stealth so it might be a glitch with that
---
Yeah, you might as well get the recipe. They're relatively cheap to make and you can sell them for a lot of caps. I had a friendly player make me the marsupial mutation yesterday, and it looks like it had a cap value of 400 at... Wait, crap, they Max at 200. Nm. 
---
Everytime I see him I think of Mermaid Man
---
Have you had any other player try to flip the switch?  Just a theory, but maybe "owner" can flip the switch anytime, but other players need the code to flip the switch after you have closed it.
---
nah its just what i think / do  
---
Pete Hines barely comments on it. Do you think Todd Howard would?
---
Does he even tweet?
---
No dumbass, the game mechanics do not physically allow for gains like that 
---
Please dear god do an AMA.   
---
I'd love for you to see the earnest feedback of this game and how everyone outside this sub feels. 
---
I got bit by the Bulk monster too. 
---
Hes got a point. Its a pain in the ass to respec talents. Theres no room for error or trial. 
---
Needs to be a full point refund option at least even it was 2000 capa or something.
---
They couldn't pay me enough money to do that if I was working for Beth, haha...
---
I was honestly just limiting my options so it's less work for them to do, which gives it better potential to actually happen. It the difference between adjusting a couple dozen compatible models and q couple hundred.
---
I was exploring with a stranger in Watoga the other day and he had an interesting idea. level up weapons the more you use them. It’s something that would have to be played around with, but at least then they would have to focus on an upgrade tree for each weapon. It might help with balancing things out. 
---
I can make quite a few of the serums now on xbox. 
---
If you need one - hit me up. 
---
Don't waste caps on MODUS. 
---
I posted the links to the 2 posts, but that only tells part of the story. You have to look at the full history first. 
---
What, people so readily forgot about Alien Colonial Marine?
---
How is the dupe fun almost over? 4 months in and duping still exists. 
---
Late-ish reply. But if you throw them overhand then ya. But if u throw them like side armed over ur head then it could be doable. Like imagine standing still and throwing a handle sized full bottle. over and under hand won't go pretty far, but if the target is to your left or right(depending on dominant hand), if you slightly swing it behind you and then over your head from the side, you'll get the most power
---
C’mon, Mr Sensationalism. 
---
If evidence shows anything, It’s that the “thank you for the feedback” will be followed try the hot button issues raised addresses in 1-2 patches, released on a bi-weekly cadence. 
---
Put credit where it’s due. 
---
I mean, what do you expect? The design lead answering your questions to connect to your computer remotely then and there and amend the binary files of your game by hand to make what you wished for reality? 
---
Exactly, even if it is like a buyable item in the game. Just please, anything in the consumer’s corner because realistically, they haven’t got much there.
---
I sold black diamond also lol, I rarely use legendary weapons, in fallout 4 I just collected them and built my very own mansion on spectacle island where it has its very own large armory that housed one of every kind of weapon plus all legendary weapons, didn't really care about the armor though
---
They should of just converted it to the FO4 trait 'Powerful' + 25% dmg. That way we'd gain a bunch of accuracy back at least. As it is TS is pretty bad now, Anti Armor, Bloodied etc are far better choices. I wouldn't of been mad if they changed Explosive to something else too, Incendiary or whatever.
---
I would do a lot more events if I had some way of knowing I wasn't about to piss away caps to travel to it. 
---
oh man i thought i was the only one who puts their throwaways in there. Well done :P
---
I like it!
---
If Bethesda even make the effort to read the LFG posts. 
---
Doubt they do. 
---
Could it be made so the icon is a chart and as less time is left, less of it is filled in? i.e. a nearly over event would an outline with a small colored in sliver. This would solve the problem of not being accessible to colorblind people as well, without a timer or more text.
---
Which is better for a heavily armoured enemy, or even a moderately armoured one?
---
At least one NPC is bothered.  &gt;! https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer%27s_log_-_Nuke_launch !&lt;
---
I might be able to help. I have a fair amount but so have a buddy that has near everything
---
Because instead of ignoring it like for the first two and a half months they're attempting to fix the exploits
---
I’m a casual player and have experienced some of the bugs. 
---
It’s always with the scorched. They refuse to die. Their health “regenerates.” I’ll knock them down to where they barely have an HP left and it’ll stay there no matter how many bullets I keep putting in them and then their health bar is full again. The game also lags when I’m fighting a few of them to the point that one second they’re standing in front of you and the next they’re behind you and you’re shooting into an empty space because they basically teleported behind you. The game stutters and lags to the point that you don’t see them move around. 
---
The game sometimes doesn’t save correctly.  Like yesterday. I needed to get my Military ID to register with the BoS. I go through all the DMV BS, get my ID, fast travel to to Fort Defiance, sign out for a bathroom break, log back in and I’m standing in front of fort defiance but I have to do all of the DMV bullshit again. 
---
I also have problems with no getting loot from things I kill which is especially annoying when I help kill a scorchbeast  in a blast zone. 
---
But these things are rare. They happen every other week or so. Not every day. 
---
there is a dude who i play with that has his base near white springs and offers soup and random loot and sometimes PA to people when playing and a rad shower when nuked
---
It was a joke. Lighten' up Francis.
---
Plus, farming challenges is boring and basically requires different builds, even if you don't want to. Basically their way of keeping you playing.
---
Good, but what level you are?
---
That's what I assumes but my buddy did it with and without entering the code, and the left the team and did it both ways. To be super sure, he went and punched my brahmin, which got my turrets to attack him and caused him to be hostile (which I immediately turned off because he rerolled and was only lvl12 getting hit by two missile turrets, lol) and again he was still able to do it both ways. 
---
So in 2 levels you’ll respec the points into a new place. Not bad
---
I haven’t been playing long but It might be a prize bot thing. I’ve noticed that they’re are prize bots and I don’t know what to do with the certificates so it could be that 
---
Yeah, in the original game "Iguana" bits were made by Iguana Bob from corpses he got from Doc Morbid.
---
 To make you feel better. The Mosstown Scorch home is a place I ran through early on and got completely fucked over, with a Scorchbeast strafing me and Scorched all over.
---
 Went back today and snuck in. She showed up right away as her fissure is nearby and this is her special pack of Scorched. Murdered them all and she never got off a shot. Snuck away. The last is symbolic as I nearly just murdered her, but decided this way was better.
---
I’m saddened this hasn’t gotten more attention
---
My concerns/suggestions/questions
---
- Assassin Sentinel is over-performing in PvP and is or will be mandatory.  Is this intended?  If not, this needs to be brought in line with the other bonuses, simply distinct for PvP.
---
- Sentinel also procs while jumping. This isn’t reflected in description and seems to be unintended.
---
- I have a new computer I purchased at the end of January.  My drivers are updated.  Full screen mode.  I get hard system lockouts, only while playing this game.  Even with settings toggled down to low.
---
- Barbarian and Evasive are bugged, and even un-bugged, seem excessively expensive. Will you consider reworking these perks?  They are duplicative and underwhelming, particularly for the required point investiture and stat investiture.
---
- Mysterious Stranger used to be one of the coolest abilities in all of Fallout, music included. Can you buff or rework this perk, including leveling the Mysterious Stranger up to a lore-appropriate level?  Perk is largely useless.
---
- Endurance is underwhelming, as are endurance perks.  The stat itself needs reworking as do the perks generally with the exception of a few perks.
---
- Many Enemy levels do not conform to difficulty.  Why are mangy rat level 21s so beefy?  Why are anglers raid bosses?
---
- Scorched Beasts either have poor hit registry, hidden perks with extreme evasion %, and/or the old invulnerability feature/bug remains, exclusive to them.
---
- Nocturnal (useless in nearly every scenario), has no purpose as a prefix.  Please rework. 
---
- Hunger/thirst are currently bugged, rapidly depleting player nutrition and water.
---
- Pick Flowers Challenge (bugged)
---
- Laser, Plasma, Energy weaponry underperforming, needs extensive reworking 
---
- Scrapped assaultron head: bugged since beta, has not been fixed.  Desperately needs a fix, or removal (depletes 100% of player fusion cells)
---
- Explore Appalachia 7600 hours rewards 20 atomic shop points.  Please remove challenge entirely.
---
- Fully Rank Up Perk Cards: bugged, does not register completions 
---
- Atomic Shop (limited time deals) are insulting when coupled with -x% off.  This is a virtual economy with no established value, appearing for the first time. It is patronizing and dishonest to suggest players are receiving a discount.
---
- Chems generally are not effective enough, chem use perks are bad investments.
---
- **********PLANS: RAIDER ARMOR IS NOT PURCHASEABLE********* a major inexplicable and frustrating decision and oversight present since beta 
---
Makes me feel like Basil Fawlty cursing god
---
It was the only way to be sure.
---
But when it lands you can one shot them. Meanwhile everyone with a gun has them break before they even for 1/16th the health in damage.
---
ITT: people wanting a live and personalised patch experience from their very own Bethesda representative. 
---
I think the blade of basset ignores 50% - depending on your perks that could be extremely useful 
---
An AMA from all 3 people that work on the game?
---
Its clearly not a AAA title. It seems to be a fundraiser for bethesda while they work on tes6 and starfield
---
I thought these where all bugged, you can complete it? And it scales? 
---
These are found on random bodies(live mobs?)  at encounter points right? I’ve only ever gotten one and I think it just disappeared when I logged out. 
---
Just joined the 'Find the Robobrain Horde' near Watoga because I'm a masochist, nothing at the start point 4 circles across the area, first two in Watoga, nothing there, just those closed off building, third area, nothing there, I gave up logged off and watched a movie. Probably just not in the mood.
---
I mean for players to report them. Of course Bethesda isn't going to have a team of people actively hunt them down.
---
Happened to me as well, other people can see you, it's just annoying have to do a full game restart to get rid of it. Would be cool if no one could see you, but both NPC's and players can see you
---
Yeah the strangler bloom at the event always does this.
---
I'm asking what they "did"
---
Pretty sure they mean "make builds other than melee a viable option for end game content"
---
I love using my sniper rifle with stealth but Bethesda doesn't
---
You misunderstood me. I don't want a vault tec colored turret. I want a giant vault boy statue (like we have) holding a mini gun and he shoots you. Imagine a giant heavy weapon bobble head that actually fires
---
Agreed on both counts. It's still a top-tier effect, up there with anti-armor and furious, it's just no longer the only affect you'd want. 
---
Whelp, that's useless then. Guess I'll be taking my keypad post down then. Thank you for the response, I've always wondered that.
---
Yes. He said FU to the moon and back.  
---
What is scarier than turret (which most people shrug off anyways?) Explosive turret 
---
Tinfoil hat take- they intentionally made it so you could and implemented a better way to track them, setting a trap of sorts.  
---
A guy can dream, right?
---
I'd be cool with that :)
---
Shit.  
---
No xD i crafted Halloween Skeleton costume to sell at vendors and in my store
---
I won them twice a workshop. I believe I have sent them both at the vendor at Camden Park and Grafton vendors .. it's still somewhat RNG, not fixed but probably only take a few hops to see it is my guess.
---
TSEs are still really powerful compared to everything else. They just need to either buff guns in general, or nerf mob health across the board.
---
Thank you for sharing your misfortune. I'll be playing tonight and definitely keeping that in mind. So do we need to scrap individual pieces for right now? 
---
Sometimes, in environments of genuine toxicity, jokes of this kind grow the toxicity mountain just as non-jokes do, despite being jokes. 
---
Let’s not. 
---
Cuz isnt it a dangerous location making it more dangerous?
---
Your camp budget is based off the number of polygons present on your placed items. Also delete those 2 turrets and you'll have a ton of free space
---
Gun runner actually doesn't work with anything if you have speed demon. Move speed is capped at 20% from all sources. So if you have speed demon nothing will increase your ms under any circumstances. Not gun runner, not sleek, not shrouded, not dead man sprinting. None of it does anything if you have speed demon.
---
I run a full crit build with a lever action rifle and although I don't pvp much but the 5 times I have it was always a win for me, even against TSE and I have only 1 endurance, so here's my secret: stealth boys with the secret agent perk. 3 headshots and every TSE kid is donezo. It might not be the same with a heavy guns build but you could give it a try and test how it feels.
---
Weapons were nerfed into the ground. Only viable build is melee now.
---
If you have Rad Worms and they are cured your mutations are now suppressed such as marsupial.
---
Costumes are randomly vanishing now.
---
Power armor armor value is higher if you are naked when you get in it.
---
Went from.double loading screen to double loading screen with an extra black screen. 
---
It worked just not the way they intended 😂
---
Low damage high attack rate weapons suck.
---
Armor needs a rework in this game, badly, or at the very least the devs need to understand what armor means for weapon balance. They give higher level enemies more and more armor like a second health bar, making them exponentially stronger and demanding higher and higher alpha strike damage to overcome these higher and higher resistances, if all guns did the same damage per shot this wouldn't matter, but there are weapons like the minigun that struggle against the armor of level 10 enemies but can't be acquired before level 35, as if it is supposed to scratch even lightly armored end game threats, lightly armored in this context being 100 or so armor on the shirtless scorched who are the lowest armor enemies at any particular level, super mutants approach 200 armor, and some of the top end enemies can close in on 300 armor at the top end. Remember, 14 armor is all that is needed to cut a minigun's damage in half, so even giving it 95% armor penetration wouldn't matter.
---
Then there are energy weapons, that don't get armor piercing, have lower alpha damage to compensate the fact that "most enemies are vulnerable to energy damage" as the devs seam to operate, in spite of the fact energy resistance across the board is HIGHER than physical, a honeybeast, which is "vulnerable" to fire and cryo (energy damage) has 132 armor, and 150 energy resistance, those super mutants with 178 armor, they have 300 energy resist. If energy weapons had double the damage output of their normal counterpart they would only be about the same, and in many cases still far worse. Remember, there is nor armor piercing for energy weapons.
---
If you took all the armor off a super mutant, and gave them 10x more hit points then a minigun would kill faster, while a super sledge would kill slower and both would end up about even.
---
The system also makes buffing weird, double a weapon's damage and you nearly quadruple it's effectiveness because you also end up halving armor.
---
Yeah, no problem, that's why I want then to fix it. My buddy didn't know what I was trying to do and was like "What the fuck? What's the point of the keypad?" which was met with "Exactly".
---
I Just buyed for Caps and then reselled??? So??? 
---
Harpers Ferry... dangerous? The only dangerous thing in that area IS the turrets. Do they even exist anywhere else on the map? Why not in silos?
---
That'd be awesome.  A lot of comments on the possibility seem to be negative, but please remember that angry people scream a lot louder than everyone else.  There's real reason for some disappointment, but most of us genuinely want helpful discourse, deeper insights, and more meaningful exchanges.    
---
Every game lives and dies by it's community, and I don't envy Bethesda having to sort through an AMA filled with unreasonably angry people, but it would immensely helpful to us all.
---
That is an interesting theory, actually. 
---
For now though, on xbox, the market is irreparably damaged. 
---
It will only be fixed when new higher tier, rare items are added. 
---
Only caveat I'd include is making the vendor inventory similar to your stash inventory in that it's linked to you, not to the vendor. That way when the game crashes and you log back in you can re-rent a vendor and the new one will still have all your stuff to sell.
---
It truly is sad. As someone who loves science weapons, I'm basically forced to follow a melee build if I attempt Whitesprings. And I'm level 83...
---
 I use an Explosive Tesla Rifle with a charging rail and it's almost useless now, since the nerf and was close to it, even before the nerf. Now, my whole build is really screwed. 
---
 Another thing... I legitimately farmed for my plans and recipes. It made my character special because I had so many plans that others would kill for. Now, my traveling salesman/engineer is almost useless. With this last update, everyone can be that character. Making all of the plans accessible through the vendors basically killed it for many of us that do salesman/repair/modifications build. That was a serious blow to the economy. 
---
 Its almost as of we are fighting an uphill battle at this point. 
---
I dunno. I don't think you are being honest. 
---
Melee requiring you to get close to enemies doesn't really sacrifice safety when the vast majority of enemies will come to you and die in one hit when they get there. 
---
Lots of materials, also plan cost 5400 caps with the level 3 card.
---
If yiu just grab a bunch of random junk and sell it to the faction vendors you can get 1600 caps a day. 
---
Hell yeah, I'm in Order of Mysteries and use them to craft that buff item with my Stealth Boys and keep on accidentally scrapping the ones I've found before I find a tinker workbench. In fact, I noticed this was happening because I scrapped everything at the tinker workbench RIGHT BEFORE I was about to craft one of them. On the upside I smacked my head hard enough that what I was doing wrong finally sunk in. Now to sell off the bulk of my Stealth Boys because they're WAY more common than HalluciGen gas canisters. 
---
The game called dying light would be a fun thing for you then it’s a parkour zombie FPS survival game that’s all you need to know
---
I found a Deathclaw gauntlet at Blackwater Mine when I first went there and it’s now my go-to weapon. It’s brutal and fun as hell. Still trying to find the extra claw mod though. 
---
Yes. It’s not perfect but it’s in better shape than this sub makes it out to be. The posts here make it seem like it crashes every 15 minutes and has only 10 hours of content, but honestly you can go several sessions without crashing and people are playing for 100 - 200 hours, etc.  If you’ve played any Bethesda games in the last few years you know it’s going to be buggy and frustrating at times, but overall really fun. If you’re on PC then mods will help. 
---
I bet there are some devs that lurk here.
---
No idea lol just putting out my thoughts out there cuz going there when a low lvl isnt necessary so maybe the turrets are placed for higher levels than  the regular
---
Can confirm. Saw one in Flatwoods, killed one in the Mire.
---
You can't stack chameleon. One piece is as effective as 5. Some people who claim it stacks say they can take more steps before they de-stealth but from my tests this is not true.
---
I need 2 points to respect demo expert, 3 more demos for a level 3 and then 2 more cards for those 2 points. that's 7 man.
---
Known issues for 76? 
---
The game is beyond broken!
---
I personally would enjoy a live stream more, simply by knowing at anytime you can open up a pre saved video of an issue/fix or balance change you looking into to actively show us what your talkikg about.
---
Like with TSE, it would have been much more well recieved to have seen a before and after vid showing how the change will affect it.
---
and the scorch queen event gives you 200 caps a piece right? Some people are just lazy :(
---
No, I  whouldnt even call it the worse game of this decade. WarZ (the game, not the movie) was worse, it literally changed the video game industry it was so bad.
---
 In the end FO:76 dosn't have the developers selling esp hacks on ebay, loot is actually somewhat randomly generated (WarZ rotated what spawned where with a weekly patch) and we have never had a patch so bad that the game actually became unplayabe forcing the dev to shut the game down for a entire week a day later to fix it.
---
 FO:76 isn't so catastrophically bad it will change the way the largest video game retailer operates. (WarZ was the first game steam ever allowed you to refund, and valve offered a refund to every single person who bought the game on the platform at one point.)
---
Musta been a Limp Bizkit fan.
---
I have all the melee mutations s well as speed demon, carnivour etc. I literally pretend I'm some beast killing and eating as I go haha 
---
two-shot is never going to be buffed again. it was clearly superior to everything else. stop crying it was a good change for the vast majority of the players.
---
Honestly they kinda thickly now. They aren’t as damaging to you. It’s more like if enemies didn’t attack you but directly attacked your armor to try and destroy it 
---
Yeah, I had a lot of hope and a lot of faith in the game and in Bethesda up until this last patch. And I’m still gonna give them one more patch to redeem themselves. After that, if they haven’t done something big to better the health and well being of the game, I’m gonna be offboard the 76 train and just wait for their next single player title. I can’t with this shit anymore, it’s been such a catastrophe the whole time. And the game was fun, I enjoyed playing it and I wanted it to become better and now it’s just not looking like it’s gonna happen, they’ve just nerfed builds to the point where everything that was fun isn’t fun anymore
---
I can explain in 3 simple words: It Just Works. You don't need to question it or wonder about it since despite any other evidence you can rest assured it's working.
---
Shadowed is among the mods that you get from plans, not from scrapping.
---
[This google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/htmlview#]) has shadowed leather armor plans as “Wearables mods random drops (Toxic Valley)” as probably a pre-patch-5 thing, so post-patch-5 the first thing I’d check is if the responders bots in Grafton sell them.
---
What is with the rendering of the assets being slow?  Not user bases but actual building assets?
---
Hopefully Bethesda decides to buff ranged weapons, as opposed to just nerfing melee.
---
Why?  Just because?  You had literally no reason to assume that.
---
If it was on Xbox you can get it back through the order section on the store. Other than that I'm not sure. 
---
Aim higher man if that's the dream!
---
Should be patched by now
---
Probably more like 99% once r/fallout and r/gaming got wind of it. Really not a productive use of anyone's time.
---
I welcome an AMA with BGS. It would be a hilarious trainwreck and they know it. Reddit AMA's are known for asking the tough, honest questions, and not relenting if a generic, blowoff answer is given, which is all BGS would produce. It would be on one of those "worst Reddit AMAs ever" listicles easily.
---
107 I think
---
The main point was that a lot of people are being detected from a long distance away and after shooting three - five bullets. Not the fact that I have 5 pieces of chameleon armor that have a shadowed mod on them.
---
I’ve never really tested the difference about the de-stealth thing.
---
Who you buy? :p
---
"Special" is a pretty common word used in real-life pistol models.
---
Let's do! I mean I'm Mr. Sensationalism after all, right? That's what I should do. 
---
And I'm sure personal attacks like yours above do absolutely nothing to grow your magic mountain of toxicity. :D
---
I've only ever done the sbq once cuz people on tha Aussie servers just don't seem to nuke very often. And being in NZ I'm never playing at peak times for them. 
---
So real talk -- I know you can totally build a molotov IRL with any kind of bottle whatsoever, but from every movie that I can think of seeing one they've always used a brown bottle. Why? Nobody knows.  But maybe that's why it's never bothered me that you can only use beer bottles in game.
---
Also seeing the favorites reset thing. Oddly, it actually re-mapped my TSE Handmade to the slot (1) previously occupied by another Handmade, (I had 3 handmade rifles in my favorites at 1, 5 &amp; 6).   
---
I'd previously seen a problem (pre-patch) when "identical" guns were favorite-d (i.e. 3 black powder pistols in "chain" slots 4-5-6 for rapid switch ala Josie Whales...) When the "same" guns got to same durability level, it seemed like the favorites slots emptied, leaving only "one" gun in favorites (and blank open slots where the other guns were). Not sure if it's related, since it's also only the "multiple guns/same type" that seem to be affected.   
---
Lol i dont go there often unless i wanted some plans but i stay out of the way cuz usually i attract hordes of everything 
---
Don’t forget some worthless body armor that’s complete shit.  I killed a 4* this afternoon and it dropped a damn wooden leg.  I mean, really?  It’s not been the same since the patch earlier in the week.  
---
so they did elder scolls online and it bombed on release until a few years later now, I'm being told it's worth playing now. Division same story, no mans sky same story. Different reasons maybe but I see it constantly now. Release a half assed game and fix later, Put up with the flak until then. Bethesda especially already knew the difficulty in converting one of their franchises to be online why would they not learn from that mistake. 
---
Why are developers the really big ones I mean with massive amounts of resources and money acting like some 2 week old indie dev with only a few coders.
---
I think I found that out the hard way. I prob scrapped 500 level 1 light leather left arms today. Go basically every mod except shadowed. Spend the other half of the day server hopping and checking most the vendors and found zero shadowed. I think the drop changed with the new patch. I also did not see one BOS Combat armor mod either. 
---
I think this is a temporary debuff to drive the auction prices down and punish dupers and their customers. Then, like a month from now after the dupes have lost value and been dropped not sold for $20 on ebay, etc., it can get buffed back up to where it should be.
---
The whining has been a mess. I understand being upset at certain things, cool, but I had somebody rage out at me as if they control anything
---
Some few people can with a crazy min-max build. This is not the standard by which you should judge melee.
---
I agree but p2w is a slippery slope, it starts with these innocent buffs and in due time you will see dmg buffs or gun cosmetics that slightly alter gun stats.
---
At best they lose the hours their devs spent on it that they could have spent working on the game.
---
At near worst the devs see the anger of the community first hand and get so demoralized they quit working on the game.
---
At absolute worst the devs see the anger of the community first hand and get so demoralized they quit life. 
---
Go to the general Steak house across the street from Robo Co. farm Generals Steak House and then Kill all Enemies in Robo co. Go back to the road. Quit game wait a min log back in. You can make 400-600 Caps a hour this method if you get super Mutants at both spots. Also pick up Grenades to sell. There can also be 3 Legendaries to spawn in that area.
---
This is how I hit Cap Limit my first 5-8 times.
---
this is correct.
---
I probably could buy the recipes i want in 20-30 days that way.
---
But im especially considering new players (characters)   
---
They may need a bunch of those 20.000cap plans.
---
Having to farm for every one of those 10+days, seems like flawed design to be honest.
---
After 1-2days of playing focusing on earning caps, they should give you the ability to purchase a cool recipe.
---
Its also not the most fun activity to sell 100+items to a vendor (item by item since the trade is clunky) 
---
I simply think there should be a better balance between ways and amount of caps earned VS prices and ways of spending caps.
---
Right now that feels off by alot (if feels like they want to increase the time needed to get fun recipes, so players wont notice how empty the game is)  
---
Ok, as You Wish...
---
So, Just suppose i was a duper, and being advertised of these bans based on weight and crafting, u suppose that i start doing duplication at the same time of the patch??? I'm not a stupid guy, then i'm not a liar, Just saying that they have something like an automatic ban method for those Who craft too much costumes, armors ecc... So why i do have to duplicate on my main account??? I'm not stupid, All i wanted was playing together with my Friends, everyone of them knows that All the thing i got went from my "Power Armor crafting service" before the patch came out i was a merchant on Power armors, i got a lot of Plans for the crafting and All my Caps went out from there. So now, i don't care if You trust me,You can't unban me, only Bethesda Can, i'm Just telling You my bad and sad story, ended by Bethesda mistakes.
---
I dont understand where this bullshit comes from. I am level 79 with a non-legendary level 45 lever rifle. I killed 2 scorchbeasts while protecting the robot for Census Violence event. That means I had to shoot at and kill multiple other enemies at the same time.  
---
I solod this event.  
---
Both scorchbeasts died and my gun didnt break.  
---
Am I missing something or does everyone else have guns made of glass?
---
I figured it's more useful to describe how often it happens to me, than to characterize how acceptable/terrible it is subjectively. We each have our own limits; the game is still fun for me whereas it wouldn't be for others at this point. That's totally fair.
---
Just because you disagree with someone doesn't make them objectively wrong and you objectively right.
---
There is a *lot* to be said for an early-available legendary pistol.  I am mind-boggled that you see this as a bad thing.
---
I have three friends who play, and we all put our C.A.M.Ps at different ends of the map, when we're online, we can fast/travel NE, NW, SE, SW and Central (Vault 76) for free. 
---
Even if we're not meeting up to do quests and play together, we party up for the fast travel. 
---
That's how we somewhat get around the fast travel cost. :)

I want some better Grammar in that post so I can read it. 😂

I mowed down an entire crop of 68s near Whitespring and the loot drops were awful.  On top of that my sweet auto grenade launcher broke way too damn early.  Talk about a kick in the nuts

You are one of the few who feels that way. Nobody is crying, it simply does not make sense. I feel that I have put together a well rounded set of options that will help bring balance and stability to the game. If you don't have constructive additions, perhaps this is the wrong thread to bring your cavalier attitude to.
---
Carnivore is freakin’ awesome. If I need the bonuses I’ll cook the meat but in a rush and my hunger is low? Who cares. I’ll eat some raw meat and be on my merry way. I always seem to start my characters planning to go for guns and ending up using melee. 
---
the fastest way I've found is to rotate throw all the vendors by selling junk and chems and also by farming the Behemont near Huntersville. Gives around 30 caps every time and you can server swap to spawn it again. Also, farming West-Tek since each super mutant gives like 4 caps so if there are 20 of them it is 80 caps per run, but super mutants have a lot of armor so it gets kind of annoying.
---
They do not encourage you to not do quests.  You are choosing to not do them because you think min/maxing a weapon is more important than enjoying the game.
---
Just gonna tag on that MIRV *grenades* basically do nothing (no frags come out) and the Quantum grenade has an incorrectly *miniscule* blast radius.
---
Truth
---
I sure hope that happens. I remember my first time fighting the SBQ. I had found this amazing 3 star legendary gatling plasma and was totally stoked to use it. I used it on her and saw her health going down before my eyes and I was like WOW I'm actually having an affect on her, holy crap this is amazeballs.... when suddenly after 2 plasma cores (I had like 15 in my inventory all saved up ) BAM it's broke. And I gave that gun away immediately I was heartbroken
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I still feel if events would give u 50-100caps and/or vendors would have a slightly higher cap.
---
The whole experience and gameplay would feel alot better and less clunky.
---
I dont feel like raising the caps from events would break the game.  
---
Aswell as the possiblity to get 3000 instead of 1600caps a day from vendors (or even 16000caps a day from vendors shouldnt break the game)  
---
People who enjoy playing/farming could actually do it.
---
I think thats a good thing
---
I have definetly done just this. I can't remember what movie but I wasn't the only one, I did step out like halfway through I think it was Peter Jackson's King Kong or something along those lines. I think quitting now would be the halfway mark. If someone is asking an honest question we shouldn't be pushing them further from the game. 
---
...that’s unique and exclusive to higher levels? At a level you spend little time at? No, it’s completely inefficient. For very basic and obvious reasons. 
---
This is such a simple and straightforward concept that you must be an obsessed fan boy. 
---
This is one of the most basic possible concepts to grasp that children understand it and have attested to that on these birds. 
---
I can’t possibly begin to understand your confusion and given the complete lack of critical thinking and elementary logic, I just can’t justify continuing a conversation with you without losing brain cells. 
---
Yes, abusing damage stacking to acquire enough alpha damage to ignore armor is really good. Alpha is all that matters in this game, and stacking 120% damage on a weapon with a high damage per shot is strong,
---
It's got what 91 damage with hardened receiver at base, multiplied by 2.2 for 200 damage, which is the critical mass where armor stops completely screwing your damage over, with 50% pen giving you an excellent amount of damage, against a super mutant of \~150 per shot
---
For references, super mutant Primuses have 178 armor, meaning any weapon with less than 178 damage per shot gets wrecked, yours is so high on the power curve you barely even need the piercing effect.
---
Going from some regular rolled items to all of a sudden having multiple god tier stuff looks suspicious. You want to exonerate yourself here is your chance. 
---
Yeah, I usually just do the whitesprings bunker, whitesprings, then the raider station below it. But that's not really earning me loads of caps I've only got ~5000 caps. 
---
Fair enough. Sorry for going personal :/
---
This subreddit seems to oscillate between silly ludicrous levels of entitlement and negativity and positive feedback with really good game-steering ideas. 
---
If it was just the bad it wouldn’t be worth the commentary. r/fallout got like that.

Worth fighting for a constructive feedback forum to hang out on.

I bought some floors from the shop, that’s it.

Excavator power armour plans are at Camden Park. There's a responder robot
---
Did you only test this once and how many maps did each player use? 100?
---
Manta man. I'm also debating on the rest I've saved up enough for them all so it would be a cool set. Running around acting like mermaid man is hilarious. 
---
Grenades only work half the time.  They're already a pain in the ass to use being that you have to hold down the same button you press for melee attacks making it clunky as fuck then you have to aim the thing and hope the enemy doesn't move a foot to his left in the next several seconds.  If you do manage to throw it correctly then you just have to pray that it isn't bugged and the grenade does no damage or if it even explodes next to them at all and doesn't zip 50 feet to your right for whatever fucking reason.  Grenades are so damn fucked.
---
A surefire mark of a functional game with a functional team behind it.
---
Dear Bethesda,
---
How do you sleep at night knowing that you ruined our beloved franchise?
---
Signed /r/Fallout 
---
It’s not just Harpers Ferry. Any turret that’s mark 7-8(forgot which one) is always explosive. It’s always been that way
---
I'm going to buy a new pip boy as well, just made that decision but yeah I'm definetly considering using some atoms now that I've started. Saved up a cool 4k just playing casual.
---
I got rid of my blade of bastett and would love to rebuild it with a Chinese officer's sword
---
Guess you don't have a shotgun build.
---
 Mine is hitting at about 130 and I have 2 armor piercing and 2 more weapon speed from perks. Its beastly. ;)
---
Pistols ARE bad. I have a pistol character and it’s just weak
---
that don't show anything but the ignorance of completing a pre-order.
---
weren’t you the guy who grinded this game like crazy ? i think you told me ~12 hours a day. kinda crazy how this one patch was enough to drive you away 
---
No problem. It also good for XP.
---
Enforcer.
---
I don't see why anyone would want an AMA with the Fo76 team. We can't even get straight answers on *this sub*, where the reception for the game is a lot better than the entire Reddit community would have patience for. 90% of the questions would be ignored, 5% would be questions by their marketing team, and the other 5% would be "we'll get back to you"-type questions. The only use a BGS AMA would have would be for comedic purposes.
---
and grenade launchers
---
Brillant
---
Love it when kids don’t realize their behavior and mannerisms give them away, and think being on the internet hides the subtle clues they leave in how they express themselves, what they care about, and their, well, juvenile way of looking at the world.
---
Even less they realize how well attuned those of us with kids are to these subtle clues. 
---
This is at the bottom of the QoL update list. It will never be touched.
---
I play the same way. Lever action and super sledge. Personally I feel it works great. 
---
Thanks for the tip, i appriciate the community sharing some knowledge with me :) &lt;3 
---
My point is, that they could make events give slightly more caps (50-100) and maybe raise the vendor cap so you dont have to visit 10vendors every day (and can maybe earn more then just 1600caps a day from selling stuff if you really want to)  
---
The mutant hunting seems like alot of fun. Aswell as farming the Behemont.
---
I would love for bethesda to embrace that kind of gameplay those, and give us a spot where you can farm many behemonts.
---
Or make a quest for those super mutants and give you another 100caps on top of the 80cap you get from the run!
---
It would feel so great and rewarding everytime u would finish that quest :)
---
I hope you get the point, the specifics are up to them. I would just hope they give us something to do.
---
I did the respawning cap runs before, and it was honestly the most fun i had in the game.
---
it was a chill predictable activity, that actually felt rewarding!!!!! and the last part made it fun!
---
I was a super Active member of All facebook communityes, i love this game and i Just growed up faster, i Just made my way with luck and a lot of trades, farmed a lot before the patches and playing since day 1. I Just got some items that i could trade for other items i do Need, the only thing i was selling was Power Armor crafting service. Sometimes maybe something else, but i traded more thanks to facebook groups.
---
I guess the question becomes, if you have incisor maxed out with the higher base damage of the ski sword. Is that still better than lower base damage of Bastet at the armor pen cap?
---
Look at bottom of picture. They are paid for with Credit that was on my account. They are not just preordered. They are paid for in full.
---
Well I just looked through his history and it's nothing but posts about wanting to buy cool stuff for caps? Did I miss something? 
---
Agreed. If you want them to acknowledge the issues we're presenting, we need to acknowledge that fixes takes time. Complain until you're hoarse if it makes you feel better, but I'm pretty sure the severity of an issue and number of users affected is the primary determinant in prioritization the fix, while how whiny the issue makes you is just the primary determinant in how whiny you are.
---
And gladiator....
---
Downing Bethesda but have no problem dumping money into EA. Hmm.
---
That's all good, but trying to dictate how others post in an open forum is about as easy as steering the Titanic through a minefield. And it's probably as I'll advised to begin with.
---
i appriciate all the tips &lt;3 
---
My point is just that i would love for bethesda to embrace us farming caps.
---
And maybe giving us a rewarding way of doing it (by adding quest to some of the current good spots or designing something fun themselves)  
---
Or simply adding more cap rewards to events (which would fix the cap issue and make events more fun/rewarding)
---
sorry but I disagree. Although must of your suggestions would definitely make the game less tedious, it is in the way of making the game easier and that is really bad for the long term and Bethesda knows it. Also, must of your suggestion might be good but being realistic, Bethesda hasn't been the greatest programmer of all time and your changes would mean such a huge code remake that is just not going to happen.
---
Yooooo. I’ll be seeing you on there if you’re on ps4. This last patch did me in too. 
---
Todd doesn't use social media
---
Looks good to me. Only thing different is I dont run bird bones or any other -str mutations, so class freak frees up some points to dump into endurance for extra health.
---
I believe turret level scales with your level
---
What's enjoyable is subjective, but most people would agree that having inferior gear and struggling to make your build work properly because appropriate level weapons of the type you want are not dropping, is not enjoyable.
---
Their poor design choice most certainly encourages players to wait if the weapon in question is for the build they are going for, it guarantees a level appropriate legendary for the build you want.  
---
I didn’t make a random assumption, like I said I’d researched it, albeit incredibly poorly it seems lol.
---
Weird flex
---
Just carry a crap pump shotgun on you and throw on enforcer. 
---
Bought the brown cowboy hat and then found the black one as a pick-up an hour later. LOL
---
oh wow another et reference post
---
The thing is the most important part of that build is the gauss rifle's high base damage, you stack all those same bonuses on a weapon with low base damage and you are exponentially less powerful, because armor in this game says any weapon that falls below the 200 damage per shot treshold can get wrecked. That is why automatics are junk.
---
Good, let's all suffer equally. Long live unarmed.
---
LOL c’mon you were going to buy that game anyway.
---
I've server hoped a but there and at watoga station.  So far I've got full sturdy combat armor and heavy legs and chest.
---
If I read through a thread and someone made it silly negative, but someone complemented the adult view, great. 
---
If someone hasn’t done the latter, I don’t see why I can do my civic duty to keep a subreddit I want fit. 
---
Theres a bug in the ”I am become death” quest. It vanished from main quests and so far theres no way to get it back. Launching a nuke doesnt complete it either.
---
Gladiator only affects the damage and affects both weapons equally though. We’re talking dps with the armor pen against an armored target(say a super mutant). Would be interested to know, if anyone has any insight.
---
^ no reason to complain, you got a 3star; it just wasn't the one you wanted.  Tons of ppl only get 1star legs.
---
Yes I used to grind 8-16 hours a day. Yes the patch a long list of Incompetence final became to much.
---
It was more than 200 sure to sell to vendors and give some to my Friends, exactly i don't know because of super duper, and i crafted It 1 day before the patch, then at 10.53 a.m. arrived the mail that says "undefinetly banned" and to write down to them what You were doing when crafting these items and explain them why i did, if i think there was an error, like they know that there Is a problem
---
I've thought it is weird that the Molotovs look like the vodka bottle, but require the beer bottles.
---
I was also wishing that if you ate any tinned item that you got a can in your Junk, or drank a beverage that the bottle would be put in your Junk as well.
---
don't do it, it'll will be filled with so many disingenuous comments. I don't know how you would filter through the legitimate constructive criticism from the salt and trolling.  the post would be locked so quickly
---
What I don't get about this post and the other hundreds like it  is you all KNEW this nerf was coming......... For like a month. So you had time to modify points lvln during that time. You didn't so that's on you.
---
once you get over the 200 damage per shot threshold that's where true power is.
---
The only thing that would get me to consider giving FO76 another shot would be if I could start a fresh character on a server where pvp has been disabled. It's been fixed enough now that my main problems aren't the game itself, but other people.

After doing some quests for Rose, I talked nice to a death-claw and all that. It told me to go back to her. I did and when I interact she just says “oh you’re back” when I interact again she threatens me (funny, but I’d like to finish the quest). 
---
I tried it on a team, off of a team and alone. I tried leaving and coming back. It’s highlighted that I need to talk to her. She just isn’t happy with my performance I guess. 😉
---
I also live in this location and I’m looking for what to build on that road
---
I enjoy a lot of EA’s games. I just don’t spend money on Micro Transactions.
---
I also bought the New Far Cry!
---
"This is the reason why it's so ridiculous that the .308 round in hunting rifles is so much more damaging than that in the LMG - it's the same round, same size/weight slug, same amount of powder, same casing. "  
---
Nah fam, this isn't a ballistics simulator and that's not how it works, and I say that as a combat vet who loves games that deeply model that sort of thing. The game does not even have the concept of ballistic coefficients, grain weights, and barrel lengths, and literally never has. Nobody wants to worry about whether their 10MM SMG is over gassed or whether the dwell time on their Handmade changes with barrel length and ROF.  
---
Do pistols maybe need a buff for gameplay and fun factor reasons? Sure, I wouldn't dispute that.  But if you're looking to get into the granularity of real-world ballistics in a game that was literally never designed to have them, you're going to be disappointed.     
---
Haha same with me! I wanted to make a sniper, 20 odd hours in and I'm remaking my character into pure melee! 
---
I mean.... what's the point in any of the posts here? It's a forum. Where people post things. 
---
The way crafting recipes work in Gamebryo doesn’t allow for substitutions or generic lists of items as inputs.
---
So the only way to have the ability to craft from different types of bottles is the have multiple recipes:
---
    Beer Bottle Molotov     
---
    Rum Bottle Molotov     
---
    Vodka Bottle Molotov     
---
    Baby Bottle Molotov     
---
    Mason Jar Molotov     
---
    _&amp;c._
---
This quickly becomes unwieldy if you want players to be able to use all their junk as it would be used in the real world.
---
You will notice than in FO4, Wild Corn and farmed Corn were separate ingestible, and only Corn could be used in cooking recipes. There was no ability to substitute one for the other. In FO76, they’ve removed the separate. Wild varieties of produce, and now Corn is Corn and Mutfruit is Mutfruit and you don’t have to care if you picked it from a field or from a farm.
---
I’m on Xbox One X. But both games should be amazing no matter what system!
---
Sounds like you are super min/maxed lol
---
Maybe there’s a table somewhere. My experience has been that if it takes, say 5-6 hits to kill a feral ghoul at a nuke zone with Black Diamond, then it’ll take 7-8 with the blade...
---
What weapon did you get?
---
Engaging food safety evaluation.
---
Oh no 
---
Yeah just don't put the bulk you want to sell or keep in your inventory while you scrap. Keep that in you s.t.a.s.h
---
Ooo tough guy 
---
Rip plastic 
---
I think rifles must be in a good place. I'm full non-auto rifle build and SB aren't much trouble unless there is more than one of them.
---
Looks fine for a bloodied melee build, but you will prob have to switch out some of those perk cards for weight reduction cards eventually.
---
Oh no, you found out Bethesda's biggest secret: they were unable to get the scorchbeast AI right, that's why they outsourced it, and each and every scorchbeast is actually controlled by an underpaid Indian clickfarm worker. :-P
---
Yeah spent like 40 something caps for Uranium Fever, it had nobody there, when I got there, there was about 20 seconds left and the event was never even started...
---
Or you could just explain it as "it's a really hot .40", which is much closer to accurate description of the recoil profile and cartridge dimensions. 
---
Nerf melee, buff energy and explosive weapons (nades/nade and missile launchers, Fat Man), and either restore Two Shot to +100% or nix it. Nix Explosive legendary effect and replace it and TS with multiple ammo types per cartridge. Armor-piercing, explosive, incendiary, subsonic, etc. with unique weight and effect on weapon condition per type.
---
Make Mini Nukes scarce and ditch the recipe.
---
Plus, i Can Just screenshot All my post, i do not Need to being a ninja to delete the One i May"not want to show" Just go and see It and proof me what i selled that was so suspicious
---
Shyeah, Right! I don't even own *a* gun, let alone many guns that would necessitate an entire rack.
---
Lol what?? You are probably very gifted then as I have never seen a SBQ down in a minute in 20+ nukes
---
It must be exhausting to be you
---
Congrats on tanking against 3 SB and saving 2 lowbies. 
---
You rock! 👍
---
Filling in time watching progress bars :)
---
Obviously i'm not talking about you personally, I'm saying when there are multiple definitions for a word, the person using that word get's to decide what definition they use, not the person receiving the word.
---
What do you mean always done this? They weighed like .01 for a while 
---
And you make that statement and Mass Effect Andromeda was 100 times better then Fallout 76.
---
So let’s be honest here and talk about it?
---
All Rise and a Gauss Rifle haven't let me down yet. 
---
Ha, so I'm not an adult now. Guess you're not really sorry. Peace out, brother.
---
Hey do you have marsupial
---
Im missing master gladiator and I'm lvl  114.... Sometimes it just forgets cards
---
give the poor guy his plastic back , Jeez bethesda
---
I used and loved that mod too. Along with "Place Anywhere" or something to that effect, it resulted in me spending a lot more time and gratification building.
---
Awesome, thx
---
lol fix yur armor...
---
OK so that maybe why it kept happening to me last night.  I'll try it out when I get home.
---
&gt;Damaging another player’s C.A.M.P tags the attacker as Wanted
---
STATUS: We’re aware of this issue and plan on addressing it in the next patch. 
---
Wait this isn't intentional? Why the f not?  Some dudes trashed my entire camp and got a 35 cap wanted (that's it, I would gladly pay that much to recoup the materials I lost repairing it...) 
---
So when fixed, we can just smash peoples shit for free?
---
Today, about 12 of us fought a scorchbeast  and it stayed on the ground about 60% of the time. We killed it with about 6 minutes to spare. Of course the server crashed about 20 minutes later but at least the battle was done.
---
i just played up my second character, and like you i didn't get it.
---
But at level 55 or 56, when you cant ad more point's you will have the whole list of perks to shose from :)
---
At lunchtime today I did the Ghoul circuit at whitespring (level 81, PS4) and oddly I encountered at least 3 of the golfer ghouls over by the cabins when I used to never ever see them.
---
Oh boy now you’ve got me thinking about heavy attacks with AP vs standard attacks. This is too much lol. 
---
I guess they’re still comparable, it’s probably the +1 strength that gives black diamond the advantage on a ghoul since they have very little armor.
---
Quite simply? You've been lucky. None of the most common bugs have a 100% replication rate. They won't always happen, or even usually happen. For most of us they happen often enough to be a serious problem, but there are hundreds of thousands of people playing this game. Statistically speaking, some people - such as yourself and others in this thread - are going to get lucky and miss most of them.  
---
So, to answer your question: you're not doing anything differently. This isn't something that has anything to do with what players are or aren't doing, really, especially since all the mods that exist so far are purely client-side and can't modify the game in any meaningful way. Whether the game works well or not is on Bethesda's end, not ours.
---
I did level up 2 levels at the same time, so I wonder if that has something to do with it. 
---
Don’t know or care what you are. 
---
Just saying that the OP’s diaper commentary about very infantile online behavior here (which, whether you’re an adult or a child, you’re chosen to defend) is spot-on correct.
---
In their other games e.g. skyrim, fallout 4 ect. They were probably just testing out adding weight. I guess it didn't get recieved well by others? 
---
How much for one
---
Snapping is *far* improved in 76, you can snap stuff you could never do in 4 like making internal walls without glitching. 
---
that is a pre-0rder ,paid in full before release. ty for agreeing.
---
How else is the small poor dev going to survive if these knights in sparkling tinfoil armor aren't there to defend the company's bad consumer practices? I mean look at all these entitled gamers, demanding a decent quality product. Such bullying I haven't seen since the days tiny EA got sucker punched by mean ol' gamers for putting a lil' bit of lootbox in their game.
---
I disagree its not overpowered. Its quality of life at best. If its available to everyone it gives no one an advantage over another. So its in no one way overpowered. Plus this isn't a pvp game so having a slight advantage means nothing.
---
They need to rebalance weapons. Civil war weapons should be balanced with regular weapons on a DPS basis. Explosive weapons should require high carry weight for ammo but do massive damage. They need to think of weapons on a category basis. 
---
You are right, they need to make it viable end game.  It seems like they really weighted this game heavily in favor of melee. 
---
Melee weapons do way more damage than guns even with zero investment in melee perks. 
---
That seems kind of crazy to me and really makes me wonder, do they actually play their own games? 
---
I mean, it does feel like they made all these weapons without bothering to test their damage output or durability. 
---
Heads roll when a product is indecently bad. Unless it's Colonial Marines, I guess in that case everyone points fingers at everyone and costumers eat dick.
---
Did he have a lot of veggies in his camp that he scrapped but are still in his storage. Ive had those eat my budget till I removed them from the stash
---
Nope. I leave it at that screen all the time and never had an issue 
---
Take a look around on the ground. I've had many instances where the legendary will actually get thrown on the ground instead of being in the loot.
---
&gt;additional ancillary pistol perks include one that gives 20% more run speed ........ The perks for pistols are horrible,  
---
Yo, literally the only weapon perk in the game that makes you run faster (and it stacks with the non-weapon ones), and you think it's horrible?   
---
My dude...
---
I have to agree with everything that you just stated. I am 100% in the same boat as you. As a long time Bethesda fan(I am 35 years old and been a gamer sine I can hold a controller in my hand), I just can not continue to support them. In my honest opinion  /u/[LoneVaultWanderer](https://www.reddit.com/user/LoneVaultWanderer) and the rest of the team, should just hand it over to the modding community. At least they know what to do with this IP.
---
 All in all... Myself and many gamers didn't dupe or fuck over the community. Why are we being punished?
---
so you are the guy that keeps taking my tech data.
---
How many hours in total? Curious.
---
At least the plan price increase shows that Bethesda is somewhat sensitive to stimulate trading.
---
I was dumping plans left and right but with these prices its worth it to hang on to them.
---
But there certainly are major issues, first with no (official) ingame chat, making trading awkward for the non-mic and english speaking players.
---
A real central trading hub wont work either except for perhaps the most rarest of items. Then again i threw away loads of 1 or 2* legendaries which couldve been at use for someone.
---
What would be cool is players could rent like a parcel at a community based village. And get a second budget for a building there (so they can keep there ‘home’ base). And place vending machines at those buidlings. This village would not be restricted by the single server but just show the buildings of all servers.
---
Not only would it be cool to visit such a place, but a good way to interact and get some competitive building going on.
---
Also could be a way to become like a wasteland real estate mogul, buy parcels at the nicest most in demand places and develop them with skilled builders.
---
90 caps (cover the cost of flux etc.). 
---
Around 600
---
I can just imagine what kind of a shitshow that would turn into.  The comment section would literally give you cancer it would be so toxic.
---
I bounced back and forth between being interested and annoyed throughout this and settled on it being a really cool idea with enough balance that I am honestly not sure if I would go through the whole process, but would love to see the option available.
---
Well, it's not just perks. It's mods that I learned from scrapping them.   I maxed out all three levels of shut gunner, plus I equipped the hardened receiver mod. I also have the bloody mess perk. That's really it as far as I know.
---
Just to add in my own for the Devs/Mods at Bethesda:  
---
Full Stealth Unyielding build w/ Chameleon Chest + Unyielding limbs, Rad and Low HP related perk cards, etc.  On PS4
---
My personal experience has been-  
---
Melee- Making stealth melee attacks seems to maintain Caution without nearby enemies picking out my exact location, or in the event they do, they do not send me into Danger when standing even directly in front of me.  
---
\---Worth noting that my Melee with an Anti-Armor Grognak is well over 600 (special boosts+mutations) before I ever make a Stealth bonus.  I have ZERO melee perks.  So each swing in stealth is 600\*3.5 (Stealth perk+Sandman, but can you imagine ninja in there?).  I'm easily one-shotting Glowings in nuked Whitespring at night.  
---
Ranged- Making a silenced single takedown headshot; nearby enemies will begin firing on my exact position and melee will begin stalking towards the spot I fired from; this occurs even if NPCs were not facing my direction when the shot was made (as though tracing the bullet trajectory).  HOWEVER, if I move as any good sniper should- I remain in caution and don't get hit, might even drop back into full Hidden.  Mobs seem to be responding to positioning, or "assuming" where the sniper is which is actually really cool and I hope intentional because the realism level is rad.  That said, they seem to be WAY too smart in figuring out the exact spot the shots came from.  
---
\---To note for comparison to melee as well:  Full Rifle perks (Master \*\*\* + the other two) + Tank Buster while using a Legendary Anti-Armor Sniper Rifle topline mods (built for max damage per shot)  I'm shooting for \~280 per shot before Stealth.  I'm doing half the damage with full perk investment.  This may be an unrelated matter and instead an issue with the Rifleman perks?  Even landing a clean headshot the same Glowing that goes down in one Grognak Swing can take about 2-3 shots to drop.  Just wanted to note it while I was on the subject.  
---
I use Glowing Ones as an example.  However this scenario also applies to lvl 50 bots in Watoga.    
---
This is all anecdotal.  My own observations from my own experiences, but hopefully it helps in some way.
---
They may not be, for sure, but how do you know they’re not making good money? 
---
This forum, or even the entire online presence of all fallout76 players who choose to interact about the game online, is a small fraction of the overall player base. 
---
Your entire argument amounts to “me and my little tribe don’t like it, so it must be a commercial failure.”
---
It may or may not be, but what you argues sure as hell ain’t proof. 
---
Yeah, if your wife plays Fallout 76, you want to convince her to go one-handed melee build for when one of these drops. There's a bladed mod for this weapon, possibly others?
---
So much plastic 
---
Well you can only get one at a time do it might have been in your inventory just the quest is hidden n
---
Cool can you make me one my ign is trainfan03
---
Faction build sets. 
---
Brotherhood, Enclave, Responders, Raiders, Vault Tec. There's a pretty big list here. 
---
Ditto my friend, been waiting for the return of the silver shroud costume. My friends pinged me in discord as soon as it release because it’s something I’ve been talking about. Just wish they’d have put a silver sub machine gun skin in with it.
---
Death has come for you... and I am its Shroud!
---
Damn dude weren't you the guy who would spend ridiculous hours grinding?  Good shit on getting fed up with new levels of incompetence.  
---
How bethesda has been given a pass for years for releasing broken unfinished games on an extremely outdated engine from the 90s with embarrassingly bad textures/graphics is completely beyond me.  
---
The engine doesn’t allow for substations of recipe inputs so the only way for this to happen is separate recipe for each type of bottle, all of which would be shown as “Molotov Cocktail” in the crafting list.
---
Thinking a bit more on it ... could you create a scrap material “Empty Bottle” that all of the types of bottles would auto-scrap into, and have that as the input to Molotov or alcohol recipes. Hmm could work ... brb have to update some of my FO4 mods ...
---
What I don’t get about this comment is the amount of foresight needed to know how exactly a game will play. Things sound a certain way but you don’t know until you really get your hands on it. Also, they nerfed demo unexpectedly, partially blind-sighting us
---
It's a bug with rad worms I believe.
---
None of the things I have said make the game any easier than it is now, so you really didn't read the post. And anything I suggested with code besides the damage counter and respec quest have been or already are code that just needs to be reverted or tweaked. Thank you for your time.
---
Well, I maxed out all three levels of heavy gunner, plus maxed out bloody mess, plus mods that boost damage. Mods that I learned by scrapping the guns. I really think that's all I've done. No mutations or anything like that. 
---
I feel this way about my last job. 
---
(Sorry, OT) 
---
Damn. So you got your money”s worth I’d say. I’ve been playing since the BETA and haven’t cracked 200 yet.
---
I predict they will be like a strike mission in Destiny, and nothing close to a real raid.
---
Going to be 50 this year and my brother and i would fight over that handheld football game from Mattel. I mastered Frogger (although Pong was a favorite in my house) on a cabinet at my local corner store, one quarter at a time. I love this game even with all the problems. I just love Fallout. It makes me happy to see so many oldies represented here. 
---
Are we sure they will even be using fixes that go into this version.  
---
They had to recode many things because the creation engine wasn't able to support multiplayer.  
---
Seems the future releases are intended to be single player it's possible they branched the F76 version off and have no intention of merging changes back into the single player properties.  
---
I'd love to hear from the team what their actual plan is for this one, it would certainly be awesome if F76 changes are made into the next games because that implies it could be a lot easier for us to get multiplayer mods for upcoming games.
---
You can save it in parts
---
That's specifically why I mentioned moderate to heavily armoured enemies. It's easy to know which one does well with low armour enemies.
---
I'm done for the night now (11:30pm UK time). But can tomorrow morning or next week (going away for the weekend). 
---
A user called u/fancycalf also sells all serums for 100caps. He is always on and really nice. 
---
So if you need it now, see if he is online. 
---
Yep had 600 hours in the game..had legit 4 TSE drop had serval Explosive Weapons dropped.
---
Was 203. Last 2 weeks just farmed plans to sell and kill SBQ. Used to level up 20 levels a day. Hit Cap Limit  40 plus times.
---
Yes I’m fed up with there incompetence.
---
Is the T51 better or something? I see so many high level players, like 100+ trying to get a suit of that. Also IGN? So I can add you and come see you for that once I have the caps lmao
---
Makes sense since for it to be closer to modern style IMO. To me the prototype and experimental stuff we find in the universe looked more modern or scifi, not retrofuture. Which is why to me at least it seems the Enclave's equipment doesn't look nearly as retrofuture as the rest of the world.
---
All right cool I’ll ask him
---
Don't tell me! Tell that to OP, he is the one that got the bludgeoning Bakeware! 
---
I saw that last when I was replacing my lvl 25 excavator pieces with the lvl 45 version.  Showed duplicates on the frame but when closing the interface and opening again, there was only 1 of each.
---
lol def bro, my non-legendary rifle and sneak build is tip top for shooting down true-sight mobs. Topkek! 
---
Update: Mutations spontaneously turn off (marsupial in particular) regardless of whether Strange in Numbers is used or not or whether I am teamed or not. 
---
Gotta keep telling myself I love this game... 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
You can earn 400-600 Caps an hour and a lot of XP farming this one spot.
---
Quite right.  Atom shop is cosmetic only.  Want to do a quest -- so it without Atom shop.
---
Bro I can feel your positivity from my screen haha. Agree with basically everything you just said, specially the quest event part of it. Also, if you go to West-Tek it is excellent for farming legendaries as well as mutations! Just throw yourself on the green tanks and it is a easy mutation, and if you do not like it then there are free decontamination towers so that you do not have to waste radaways. Oh and by the way, do not forget that in 2 (maybe just 1 tho I cant remember) of the fev tanks there are those super mutant meat balls which always have around 50 caps so it is basically free money. Keeping the cap farming stats. Also the Monster Mash event spawns a whole lot of ghouls which could have some caps in their inventories, plus it is a quite could event too. Another great strat is to visit Grafton each time you login to check if the Grafton Day event pops. Super easy level 40 Grafton Monster spawns and you get like 20 caps from the mob plus some goodies from completing the event. So yeah those are my personal ways to farm for caps while waiting for the vendors to refill, and also when killing all those super mutants, collect their assault rifles since they sell for a really good price. Hope it helps :)
---
stealth and VATS is much different with the recent patch and hotfix. I run a full set of muffled/shadowed chameleon armor, and have a full set of muffled/shadowed weightless armor and chameleon mutation. in either armour and level 3 sneak, i could fire a 3 revolver shots while crouch walking without hitting danger around regular mobs. With a silenced weapon, level 68 super mutants would run into and past me to where they last thought i was. With escape artist i could RUN 10 feet,  sneak, and enter caution with regular mobs (scorched/mole miner/ghouls/super mutants), only a pack of 5+ regular mobs with LOS or scorched beasts/cryptids and other mobs required me to run 20-30-50 feet to hit caution again. now in west tek two "alert" super mutants with LOS can see me and then 10 more that can't see me instantly know where I am, requiring me to run nearly 50-100 yards away to hit caution with escape artist.
---
the hidden effect of chameleon does stack for AI, you've never been able to sneak walk and stay in the chameleon cloaked mode, but the effect on AI is present as long as you are in caution, whether you are cloaked or not. You can kind of game the Chameleon cloaking effect to stay cloaked while moving, but you have to move so slowly that its not useful or game breaking.
---
It sounds like a more reliable fertilizer producer than the Brahmin pen, something tells me people will be less reluctant to slaughter an innocent baby than they will my poor innocent Brahmin!
---
Yeah. I tend to disagree with OP, but bullshit lies are about par for the course on this subreddit so I'm neither surprised, nor disappointed.
---
&gt;So if weight isn't a problem pistols are worthless?
---
If AP costs in VATS are the same/similar to FO4, then they should be cheaper to use in VATS. Depending on the specifics, it might mean that a crit-based build might be better with pistols than rifles.
---
They are rifled. They arent rifles. Rifle has referred to small arms exclusively for a rather long time.
---
Large calibre guns with rifling are called rifled guns, not rifles.
---
If you're going to be semantic, be correct.
---
Damn dude get your money back

https://www.geek.com/games/is-anthem-the-next-fallout-76-1771786/
---
Anthem aint looking good
---
On PS4 putting it into rest mode on the main screen seems to cause issues with the social menu. If I boot from the XMB it will populate on login, but if I boot directly to the game from rest mode it won’t. 
---
Can not be as worse as Fallout 76
---
My rage is that there seems to be damage falloff unless your target is right I front of you.  If you want to maximize your damage as a sniper, do it from melee range.
---
Ah ok. Have seen a few posts about it so figured it may be related considering the " symptoms"
---
They do by putting your str to 11
---
It's not entirely systems based, but I'd love to see deep dives into specific quests, taking about level design, plot, &amp;c.
---
The end of the glass cavern with the scorchbeast &amp; dead BOS is so powerful, and I'd love to know how it was iterated
---
Came here to post this.
---
Bug
---
Never in my life would I think fallout would get this low man
---
Makes me sad and ashamed for my fallout tattoo on my calf lol. I’m sure 5 will redeem the series.
---
Its incredibly active since every person is a fan loving the game
---
Managed to kill her in my most recent fight, but there was a weird glitch(?) where the game wasn't tracking her movement. 
---
Every single time I fought her, there was a yellow diamond on the map showing her location.  Without that marker to follow it was a little confusing. 
---
Maybe I just didn't have the quest "Scorched Earth" marked in my pip boy, but I've never had to go into my point and make sure the quest was marked in the past. 
---
It was odd. 
---
It'll be tied to ppls internet connections.
---
depends on the server more than you. If you do move looking down or anywhere to have less screen effects will help a lot. PS4 actually falls behind on that part. the perception change sort of nerfs how effective that is in this game but it is still something that helps a little
---
super important. try not to spawn next to your camp. honestly that's only if you're having real trouble. 
---
One would think...I can actually carry more in my street-armor than in my PA due to weight reduction mods on my armor and deep pockets.  Pretty much only hope into my PA for nuke zones
---
How do I keep playing when every weapon I want to use literally breaks within 5-10 minutes?
---
No, as far as I can tell it stays on till you leave the server. Sometimes it stays flipped even after leaving lol.
---
I played Wildstar, which was unpopular, and I saw the harassment on their streams. Moderation is heavily reactive, not proactive, and there's only so much they can do. Even on Twitch I would see people being toxic and trying to pull the stream off rails.
---
So no, it's not a red herring, it's called reality. 
---
There's a bunch around some near the pioneer scout camp. With the wood collecting perk, I gotten 40 from a brief trip around the area.
---
Haha I had to convert to heavy weapons secondary for my melee. Before I would just jump around and swing at it pretending I almost got it. 
---
I went in with a friend and I found the Vault Boy Mining headlamp and he found the t-45 super bright headlamp. They were located in a red industrial trunk in one of the rooms in the mine.
---
Why can't you be working at Bethesda.....
---
You have to be really careful with these laggy ass servers. Sometimes it seems like it didn't register your click/button press, so you press it again and it ends up selling two things at once. 
---
They are priced that way so you trade with players.
---
Active traders can hit the 25k cap very quickly especially with tse not being the best anymore
---
you can't  play legit and have 16 000 pounds of scrap... i weight sometimes 450 lbps and it's a lot already you are a duper probably
---
That would ruin the game for me. I’m still finding new areas of the game while out exploring. Found a Pied Piper eyebot the other day. It was leading a group of friendly radrats. Also taking the time to examine things closely when I stumble upon them. Kind of cool how you can piece together what happened in each situation with the corpses and skeletons. Love it. 
---
yo on a similar note, there should be threads or even quilds that endorse behaviour for good server quality.
---
I do also understand that the second you start blowing shit up, the servers are pushed but that's a way we should actually be pushing, so long as its for functional ingame purposes. 
---
The whole game is one big fuck off. 
---
I just want a "blueprint all" option, blueprint should equal build budget and shouldn't have to tag everything individually.....
---
This is why I don't launch nukes at fissure site prime anymore. I let someone else do the dirty work and just join in the fight when it happens. 
---
I'd be furious if I went through the trouble of clearing the silo, launching the nuke, taking  out 1/3 of the queen's health, only to have  the server crash.
---
Really sucks man. Sorry to hear that.
---
I sell my excess water to vendors. 
---
no, man, I SET A QUANTITY AT 3! I was selling three something, and sold a sledgehammer
---
I don’t mean moderators cleaning up what’s already up. 
---
I mean moderators serving as gatekeepers for what goes up during an AMA session. 
---
I appriciate the kind words (they really warm my heart) and list of juicy tips &lt;3 
---
Will check everyone of those out, Grafton is one i really like, both events are super fun i do them all the time!
---
Every tip helps me and i hope every comment helps bethesda improve the game :)   
---
Have a good one my friend and much love &lt;3 
---
PS: If you ever wanna chat or play feel free to send me your discord or fallout 76 name i would love to add you :)
---
Is it gone from stats or just not working. For me it was wonky because of the rad worms bug.
---
This article looks like it was written by someone who didn't actually play the demo. My friends and I all played it, and for a demo version it worked great after they fixed the inital issues, which they resolved pretty quickly as far as I could tell. Playing the open demo now and having a blast. 😊
---
Ok message me please
---
I like this, there are stuff i see that i think "this would be cool in my camp on a shelf"
---
MAKE IT HAPPEN BETHESDA!!!!
---
you screwing up too much, now its ur turn to listen to us!!! 
---
I don't let Internet strangers tell me what I should or shouldn't like. But hey, you do you.
---
Stop using OP melee.
---
Yeah, totally agree. All explosive weapons (the natural ones, not the ones from the legendary effect) are way to weak. Even with the old demolition expert they where not strong enough if you take into account how heavy the ammo is and how costly it is to craft said ammo. 
---
I know right? Why on earth do people not want to spend multiple hours a day in a video game doing monotonous unfun things for a handful of caps a day for almost 2 weeks to buy a SINGLE plan. People are just so lazy not wanting to spend their valuable time doing that. The nerve of those lazy people. 
---
Breaks after 3 enemies.
---
The D is strong with this meme
---
My and my wife’s accounts are both stuck in the Mistress of Mystery quest line. I’ve submitted help requests and followed all the recommended mitigation steps with no luck.
---
*very minor spoilers to follow:
---
We completed the steps to gain Olivia’s login but do not have the login option in the CRYPTOS computer. The quest to gain her login/holotape is completed but we don’t have the Olivia holotape so we can’t access the next step in the quest. 
---
This is my preferred build as well.  Does it stack with the max level incisor perk?
---
&gt; Why is a CAMP item worth more than a life?
---
'cos the programmers are libertarians?
---
Its really just armor penetration.  If you have perks that give your weapon armor pen, or you can get a magazine that gives it armor pen, the gun is serviceable.  Revolvers have neither.  Its also a big reason energy weapons suck since there is no energy resistance penetration.  The reason the sommerset is so op when you level is because of its armor pen.
---
I also wish they would make the single action the highest damaging revolver.  It has the longest reload after all and it sounds like a hand cannon when you fire it.
---
If you can decorate your camp with all those junks items, I think fewer people will feel the need to buy camp items from Atomic shop, so...
---
Can you PM me, I been trying to make a non shotgun/rifle build work after nerf to no avail.
---
Right I have a lvl 5 unyeilding pice that also gives an extra +1 cha, then I slap on all my other unyeilding. After that, go get a ton of rads or knock your health down low some other way (rads is easiest). Now your stats should have a healthy bonus, enjoy your shopping!
---
It's gone from my stats too.  I don't think any of my other mutations are gone, just that one.  Unfortunately, that's the best mutation there is.
---
wait for robots to load in a walk without stutter.
---
TSE Gatling Plasma. Bloody Auto Grenade Launcher. 
---
It's fun, but they both break after 1-6 minutes of use. So I kind of stopped logging in.
---
Well you're a little out of context then, cause I was replying about livestreams, not the AMA. I have problems with the AMA but they're a bit different.
---
I like the weekly idea, but I think it makes the capmax too strong for Bethesda liking.  And I love the idea of an extra junk stash, although I don't have much hope in them changing/adding it.
---
It's funny you pay a bunch of money to get something. they give you dollar store vendor trash instead then to compensate for blatantly ripping you off they say hey kid here's five dollars that you can only spend in my store on imaginary items....am I the only one who thinks this is some next level bullshit? If people condone the practices of these big company's screwing over the little guys it will only get worse from here on out
---
They are already dangerously near.
---
“Through February 4, gain +15 max health for each member on your team wearing a unique unstoppables outfit!”
---
You don't always hit the scorchbeast. But when you do, you stick it up it's rear.
---
I gigglesnorted. He hurled that thing. Did you go looking for it?
---
I honestly haven't heard much about Anthem nor did I have plans now or later to purchase it I was mearly pointing attention to the fact FO76 is now the go to term for a bad MMO
---
Explain live-streams please. 
---
By the last mission you will have to drop a nuke. Enjoy the game play as you have many hours of leveling before you will launch your first nuke (unless you join a person's group).
---
 I don't know if we need it. If the blade is 50% then I should have 100% with 2 Incisor. It feels like its 100%, I carve up Muties like dinner. ;)
---
It's pretty damn bad, maybe not 10% but more like 20% or so.
---
it only takes one...
---
yes you got banned for duping even though you didn't.. 
---
easy way yo fix that make 10, srap 10 ... yes it takes longer.. but... patience gets you past the idots who want to circumvent the system... 
---
easy way to describe... tortoise and the hare..!
---
From what I have seen, I really doubt the game is going to be very well patched or supported. I think the most we can hope for, is the ability to run the game on private servers, and have the modding community fix the game. I see a lot of potential for modders to come in and improve the game.
---
I honestly love the idea of being a trader (and setting up shop)  
---
But i feel like the limited carryweight really disabled that playstyle abit.
---
Also i heared that some people were proud of having the actual recepies or power armor mods.  
---
Now its easier/more predictable to buy them yourself. (dont have to server hop so much just have the caps)  
---
I think if they would find a good balance for the legendaries, that would improve trading the most (make TSE viable but not the \*best\* )
---
Also adding more cool mods/buffing other mods and guns so they are actually viable, could be a good way.
---
I wanted to make a pistol character when i first started, but i didnt find a fun pistol to use.... (if they would make all weapon classes great and strong, for example energy weapons, trading would be a more common thing)  
---
Right now you are so limited in good builds, once you got your items , there is no reason to try something different (because its shitty) 
---
I'd be okay with nerfing damage a bit to hit multiple enemies, it wouldn't really affect PvP much, though. Just PvE. 
---
No, a bug. If you enter your power armor with underarmor (clothes are fine) you have less resist than you should have. If you unequip your underarmor before you enter power armor, you have the full resist of your PA.
---
That’s a pre order.
---
It’s how my legally got tse handmaid makes me feel now since it was nerfed.
---
Ah, cool found it, ty. It doesn't stand out as much as I expected when running through them all.
---
It would explain their unending rage at the world.
---
Now that Str can be 15, PA was left behind at 11.
---
Good game but not really relevant.
---
Me too.
---
Ive been on and off about it. But i play more like a weirdo than an actual survivor. When i scrapped my stash to make more room, my husband saw i literally have dedicated my stash to junk... which i know is a bit much.... i obviously have a problem. And i appreciate the thought, but i can gather some plastic up. It will take all day, but i enjoy the scavenging aspect to the game. I really hope the game improves for players like you as well. It's all we can hope for in these times. Lol
---
Yea sure we could play sometime but I'm on PS4 so idk about you :C I'll dm you me discord if you want to tho, you seem quite nice.
---
Dat quick left turn
---
Leveling at 100 is the same at 400
---
Qustion: if I drop a nuke for my last mission will everyone on the server see it and get rad and their base be destroyed?
---
&gt; for a demo version it worked great after they fixed the inital issues
---
Sounds exactly like what people said in the B.E.T.A
---
&gt; and I can't think of one off the top of my head that has been as rocky and meandering as this one... 
---
Everquest, Star Wars Galaxies, DCUO, WoW, The Old Republic... dear lord TOR &gt;.&lt;   
---
and more recently Final Fantasy XIV.    
---
Sorry, that's not meant to like argue- if anything I mean it to help underscore the point you're trying to make.  Game launches are rocky.  ONLINE game launches are a nightmare.  Even the best of them still took about 3 months to get stable/playable.  -and I played all the listed above during those early, horror-show months, and beyond... 
---
...except DCUO because that F2P move THAT quick was just the biggest middle finger in my face. 
---
No 5, 76 is the first in the series following a new direction for the franchise....
---
Look at bottom of pic. It already took the money out of my account. They are paid for just waiting on release.
---
Hey, are you on xbox? If i gather enough plastic today i will start to donate to the players who went through the similar instance. I know how much gathering junk is not some players cup o tea.
---
Everyone on the team sees the leaders quests. But any quests everyone else has are not shown unless the team leader is tracking them.
---
Which is an absolute pain in the ass in this current patch.
---
I just got home and server hopped at Watoga Station.
---
Heavy Combat armor plans (not mod plans) are still random.
---
Level 56, PS4.
---
1st time:  Heavy Combat Torso Plan
---
2nd time:  Heavy Combat Torso Plan
---
3rd time:  Heavy Combat Arm Plan
---
Each Heavy Combat Plan cost me 970 caps with 4 Charisma and Hard Bargain 3.  But after getting Legs the first day I now have the whole set.
---
Annoying that it is still randomized after they said it was not.
---
Have not seen Marine armor plans
---
This is only a visual bug, that shows that ammo get´s taken away from a gun you used ealier. The truth is that you don´t actually lose ammo.
---
Just need to know where to look my friend, raider camps are absolutely chuck a block with them
---
In the context of the person I was originally responding to, live video that showcases the devs talking about plans for the game and such. That's basically what Wildstar tried to do on Twitch and every time the chat section was full of asshats who tried to derail. Given how little known that game was compared to Fallout 76, I think a Bethesda version of that would be a complete nightmare.  
---
having a mule etc etc alt tabbing etc is not at all the way it's meant to be played... enjoy your ban
---
What is the note called in the inventory, I've never seen this and I think it's pretty cool!
---
Can I get a link to these such games , might as well get some free stuff. , hahahahaha
---
Nuka bottle should be able to be crafted into molotov missiles 
---
Then...play...Mass Effect?
---
I guess I'm glad you enjoy letting the internet know you don't like this game and showing us your pre-orders. 
---
saw the image... clicked the link... saw this dude's round house design... remebered my floating junk pile of a base... smashed an upvote.
---
&gt; By the way everyone if you server hop for Ballistic Fiber, or anything really, then it's considered an exploit. 
---
And you're considered an idiot.
---
It does. You didn't think that much metal *actually* weighed only 10 pounds, did you? Most power armor is just compensating for its own weight.
---
Demo expert nerf was definitely overkill.
---
Agreed. Ghouls and scorched piling up on you isn't even really a challenge, just a nuisance. Being able to hit multiple enemies at once would be great, but I think it should be limited to maybe only 2-3 at once. 
---
So when u have nothing store what's the grey bare behind the white one food growing?
---
No you would build your own legs and then trade those over to him to mod them. We've been doing stuff like this for weeks. He's collecting the excavator plans and I am collecting the t-45 plans. Another guy is collecting the t51 plans and another one t60.
---
I wish I understood why they don't want to be helped.
---
Had one fall down a fissure pool. Several people around all did thumbs down. One guy puked on it lol
---
Damn. 
---
That's honestly a prime example of how out of hand I feel this game is. Bethesda can't even put out an update-something meant to fix problems-without breaking something else.
---
Maybe once you acquire &lt;leather right leg&gt; you can attach your "bladed" mod to it.   
---
\#itsbladed 
---
Well bubblegum is today’s daily again. The only places I know of is in whitesprings. In the bungalows with the Christmas trees and all the toys, and in the laundry room near the parking lot. I’ll update if I find more 
---
I literally was able to fly on a nuke zone with power armor not once did I hit the floor.
---
As a result I was a gliding vats killing machine flying over Morgantown but then I wasn’t able to stop floating , unable to loot anything.
---
Cool but annoying 
---
It still looks like a great game, I expect the In GameShop to be typical EA overpriced crap and eventually the will go with loot boxes but still worth a try.
---
I thought F76 would be my forever game by so far the have nerf'd my weapon by 80%, nerf'd my perks, stealth is broken and they nerf'd critical builds. The only viable build right now is melee and with a Str of 1,  I am in a bad place to respec my build.  I am looking at a 30 level grind to fix this while doing less damage than a Melee 100 level below me.
---
Wow I loved the game and my character so much, then with 1 patch and 1 hotfix my build is no fubar'd I am at a loss on how to start fixing this mess.
---
While I will hope for some epic patch that fixes everything I will be looking for something that truly catches my eye. 
---
Are you butt hurt that I woke up and became aware of the incompetence of Bethesda Austin? That I see that they have a great base game and they don’t know what they are doing?...that I can afford to buy better games?
---
That I’m showing others that I was putting my money where my mouth is and I unhappy and walking away?
---
Exactly!
---
It can become a chore at times.
---
Can we have a radio or jukebox for our Camps that plays the regular radio station? 
---
It's just sad that fallout was trying to compete in the grinding scene.. but instead has pushed away those hardcore grinding gamers.
---
Theoretically true but a nightmare in practice!
---
False. You do need to carry multiple since they do not have the durability of melee and single shot guns, but you're just spreading misinformation.
---
[Here](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/rtrnofdmax/video/68553672) is a clip I made last night. I am still working on my farming route in a Morgantown Nuke zone, but you can see me clear two large groups without the gun breaking. I killed at least as many before and after this clip.
---
Pretty positive I saw them at Lewisberg station since the new patch.
---
https://imgur.com/a/pC79bIA
---
It's not that big. The target area will be marked on the map, and everyone will be given short warning and enough time to vacate the area. 
---
I was a major grinder in the game. 600 hours Level 203. Yeah they pushed me away.
---
How are they able to tell if you are server hopping or getting disconnected, it happens often enough.
---
Only the area you drop the nuke in will experience those effects. And there is a countdown server wide so people know. 
---
It's a small area. Players are notified and can leave think it takes 3 min to land. As u play if you see  a big red circle on map that's a nuke zone. 
---
People love to circlejerk. It's how they get those sweet fake Internet points.
---
Honestly I was amazed that they even had that as a modification in a multiplayer game. It was op in Fallout 4 but it didn't matter because it's a single player game. 2 Shot made all other modifications obsolete
---
Seriously, what was BGS thinking? Yeah sure dude a fucking board with a nail in it is more durable than a fucking gatling gun. Whatever.
---
Well for me I just want their stuff and I hope they don't take it too hard 
---
Let us know how that turns out
---
RIP
---
Bethesda should sell Fallout 76 IP to some other company. Studio that enjoys developing Fo76. They obviously don't care about the patches and content. Somehow they can release broken game builds and people still play the game and accept every buggy update. Not many studios have gained that kind of position, where they can publish shit without consequences. Change of studio would be so amazing.
---
No clue where they came from 😂
---
It would make sense, since we are fellow vault dwellers... trying to survive after being cooped up together.
---
