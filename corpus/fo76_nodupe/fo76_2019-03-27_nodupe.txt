I used to use it and it triples the time. Hmm have to try nukashine and see, but I'm sure it does triple time. When I was low level, it kept me from getting addicted to alcohol between bottles.
---
---
---
I didn’t even get to really experience the event. Busy life is cruel lol. I did get a couple masks and plans though. My one good run had a ton of people that were considerate and let us all tag the sloth.
---
I played the beta and retired that character at launch instead of carrying the progress. Used him for the first time in months for the survival beta. 
---
it probably depends on what the players think and ive seen a mix of reviews about ones saying people should stop whining about being kill and ones saying you should have to start a new survival character.
---

---
I personaly think you should have to start a new survival only character so TSE and AA weapons are actually rare instead of being duped to shit.
---
You werent able to recover your junk?
---
So crowd are the watchers... are alarm clocks the keepers? (Of time 😂)
---
&gt; I raise a purified water to everyone here and hope your journeys in Appalachia stay interesting and friendly. 
---
Ok, but wouln't you rather have a Nukashine?
---
Women gamers rarely open their Mics.  Consider yourself lucky she even yelled at you. Thanks for reinforcing my point.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah I thought so too. But all ever did for me was triple the time. I have a nukashine though, can test out.
---
Thanks for this, I was having problems today
---
I was a little hype for that camo...let's hope that this reaches to Bethesda.
---
Just don’t. 
---
I am having the exact same issue with bourbon. I am out of about 10 bourbons and nothing.
---
No, but like I said, my bad...I tried...done. ;)
---
keep looking you'll get there. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Though its much easier to find decent rips of the first book and the newer ones done by Kevin after  Frank Herbert's death mainly as they where published after the era of public library making really bad tape audiobooks.
---
Its kinda weird that no one has done a fully voiced and consistent with the actors production of all of them if anything is begging for that kinda treatment its dune.
---
Of you can send me the exact name of the plan I can have dig through my stash in the morning 
---
I'll experiment with it when I am on again.
---
This.  Just friggin pay attention and prepare.
---
That looks amazing! Great job!
---
Option 3. Takes items from player to cover cap amount. Killer gets caps, player trying to no risk potentially loses gear.
---
Put your gun away first 
---
Yeah, I'm pretty excited for prestige mode, I had the most fun in the game at the early levels when I was actually afraid of fighting packs of super mutants or anglers. I also wonder what the Nuclear Winter mode will change, hopefully they make something like a ''hard mode'' PvE where all enemies are lvl 50+ and they deal more damage, have increased legendary spawn rate,etc stuff like the FO4 survival mode.
---
Shhh our little secret
---
Just looking through myself, don't have it either, and when you check the atom store, there isn't even a camo paint for the shotgun that they said it was supposed to get. Hopefully they correct that.
---
Thankfully there are still idiots in Adventure mode who try to defend their CAMP 😂😂
---
I bought it on launch day because I have loved Fallout since the first game (the REAL first game, not FO3) I played for about a month or two (got to about level 33) and lost interest. I also saw the road map, and thought that I should check it out again, but when I heard about Fasnacht and the fun everybody was having with that, I immediately jumped back in.
---
I'm definitely enjoying it again and hope to see it grow even more in the future!
---
I just tried to recreate the bug on PS4 and it appears you're right, but (weirdly enough) doesn't work for the helmet. I tried it on my X-01 but the Wasteland Walker paint is still grayed out. I didn't have a T-45 or T-60 to test on.
---
No I agree it's shit. I would love a BOS paladin paint job for the ultracite armor. It is BOS armor after all. I don't know why it can't be outfitted with the brotherhood insignia. Come on Bethesda. 
---
Right now it’s not a place we’re you can expect to have normal non-violent interactions with players. Everyone is shooting everyone. And it will be like that until the novelty wares off and Bethesda does a bit more balancing. 
---
Normally I am one to avoid opinions and check a game out if it looks interesting to me. Plus, I always try to find something enjoyable, especially if I put the money out for it. Honestly with that kind of thinking, I am normally in a situation where I don’t regret my purchase. With that said, I didn’t have a problem finding something to enjoy about 76. This game is a blast, especially with friends, and I enjoy it as much as every Fallout. Sure it has its problems, which every game has, but it’s still quite enjoyable. Maybe I am a little biased because my town is in the game lol, but I really enjoy the map and it’s layout as well. 
---
I won’t lie though. There have been times I have been bored since I did most of the quests, but with them adding new things within these updates, it’s just getting better from here. Glad to see you enjoying the game and I raise a purified water to you as well. 
---
It doesnt remove the ability to 1 shot, but it does make it PvP instead of hide from the scary people.
---
Excellent let the games begin

Yea, I saw a few days ago about talk that Ultracite was getting a paint job. Was expecting something decent, got "Prototype" instead. lol
---
I did, got OS by some random duo in PA, was so quick i couldn't even see the weapon they shot me with, not very survival like to me
---
There are legitimate reasons to allow mode swapping. Mode swapping makes it so I don't have to make a new character to do unregulated PVP, or if I were a future player who starts on survival, it doesn't require me to make a new character if I decide to play on adventure. A fresh start is also a poor reason to forc eus to make new characters, as forcing us to make them would have only delayed what we have now until dedicated players built up an arsenal, which wouldn't be much time. The problems with survival wouldn't be solved with a "fresh start".
---
THIS YOUR SO RIGHT PREPARE FOR THE SLAUGHTER
---
Interesting, I think there would need to be some safeguards in place as there are just some players who are just broke, especially when starting new characters, and this could be potentially unfair to them. I do appreciate the idea tho!
---
No problem friend. Typically what I do when I wanna make friends without much commitment/without mic is walk up to someone, right in front of them, and spam crouch/heart emote until it becomes clear that I'm not going anywhere any time soon lmoaaa 
---
This is awesome! 
---
I said this same thing in the BDO forums; one-shotting someone isn't PvP. It's hide and seek. One-shotting is boring for the winner, and frustrating for the defeated.
---
I just spent three hours in it. Never had more than one hit either way. I have some serious OP guns. It was a game of who can get the first hit. 
---
I fast traveled to Morgantown, died before the screen loaded, figured I try again, just because, I heard someone say , "he respawned" before the screen loaded and died again. Went elsewhere then.
---
They either need to make the travel/spawn points safe, (but then people will just camp further out), or increase the places to spawn/travel (but people will eventually figure that out and camp them too but will be thinned out), or allow respawn anywhere. 
---
Even a combination, like, can only travel to stations, that are safe zones, giving one a chance to assess the area before engaging, while deaths allow respawn anywhere on the map with 10 or more seconds of invincible unless you shoot/attack. 
---
The Basha would be a light weight item, deployable like a suit of Power Armour, but would need to be placed in the vicinity of two or more trees. It would allow players to use it as if it was a Weapons workshop and cooking workshop, along with using it as a Stash. It would allow a maximum of two players to take shelter within it-hiding them from sight whilst also being protected with the ability to rest there and then.  
---
\--
---
The Bergen would be a wearable item that would allow the player to increase their carry weight, it would likely have mods like this:  
---
Normal: +100 max carry weight
---
Rocket pouches: +40 max carry weight  
---
Waist and back protection: +20 Damage resistance
---
Strap pouches: +15 max carry weight  
---
Waist pouches: +10 max carry weight, - 10% AP  
---
\[And a bunch of mods that change its' colour/ camouflage\]  
---
The Assault Vest would primary be cosmetic, but would add  +24 max carry weight, +40 Damage resistance, +20 Energy resistance with -5% AP. It would most likely take up the chest slot.
---
Hiding has nothing to do with this, 8m talking full on pvp in their face. Sneak attacks dont apply here. If it did, they would of nerfed sneak attacks instead.
---
Yes i am complaining but seeing as its a beta and theyll take and consider the players suggestions i will complain. Im not gonna play survival bc its awfully unbalanced. The respawn invulnerability isnt active right now so people kill you as you load and you lose 100 caps in seconds. Sure it may be an endgame type of. Mode but i dont see where that s fun for anyone without god rolls on a power weapon.
---
Ehh i mean in my opinion it just drives home how this game or any fallout for that matter shouldnt be a multiplayer game, because it is a mechanic of fallout games.
---
&gt; There's still a lot of issues with the game, especially the end game,
---
See, this is a problem I have.  In an online game with potentially unlimited updates what is this *end game* of which you speak? 
---
I would love to pick these safes when I come across them...except I don't want to even take the 5 seconds it takes to switch the perks around because I'm so sick of doing it.
---
It will die down. I hope. I just want to be able to play the normal game with looming high stakes risk. Not a deathmatch shit storm. 
---
I agree and see how this could be a turn off for a lot of new players. In other games I mostly play stealth/melee but finally landed on rifle/vats at level 92.  Since the game revolves around the number 76, how about offering a reset of your SPECIAL points at level 76?
---
Look at the patch notes and it’ll be clearer then anyone can explain it 
---
I've seen it a few days after the game was out on the mountain near Flatwoods where there is a wooden training circuit i never managed to complete.
---
Tbh I don't blame Pete for the social media blackout. Just about anything he said would've been met with almost nothing but hate, and a large portion of the response would still currently be that. 
---
The "end game" should be content which players can repeatedly do which gives people a challenge and things to do after they've exhausted questing. Right now, the end game is just battling the Scorchbeast Queen, but they've got dungeons (the vaults) and other things coming which should add to it.
---
You know, you had me right up until you said " it is nice to have a break stuff server....etc.'  Sounds like you are a griefer at heart.  Thanks for your personal reply.
---
Legit cant even spawn in far enough for that. Not the problem.
---
Read my above comment. So why should my rifles be dealing less damage if sneaking and hiding is the issue?
---
Its been in the game since Fallout 1 to be honest.
---
Must have been enjoyable.
---
Harper's ferry vendor and watoga vendor sell some wall plans.
---
My bad kinda forgot about it havent played in a month or so I'll reinstall once I get home.
---
I think its crimson flux I need to make it the other materials are mundane things I most likely already have
---
Please do...seriously....it’s a great idea...
---
yes please, whenever I see a key now I pause and scroll through my misc section to avoid getting a double. and as said I have so many stupid hornwright cards....
---
I only use a combat shotgun, I just really want a nice paint to put on it. In 4 I had a 'flame' paint from the creation club.
---
one instance :P
---
like its not going on in most of the severs at vault 76 
---
PvP Griefers would have stayed but since slap damage is reduced to 0, it's a bit harder to do when you can't kill someone. It was a really good move IMO to force people to move over to Survival if they want to role-play a sociopath.
---
It might have something to do with the constant exposure to radiation. Sure, we can use some radaway to cure it, but long term effects on the brain and it's mental state have got to be taxing. All sorts of mental illness could be emerging we don't even know about. Not to mention the PTSD from being thrusted into this world, first thing out of the vault your attacked by flying commie robots trying to kill you... 
---
Add in the constant need for drugs, booze and pharmaceuticals that have to be used just to survive and you can start to easily see how everyone goes a little psycho. 
---
Spawn at your camp
---
What the hell does that mean?
---
Also the vendor in the ski resort by top of the world should have the warehouse plans if i recall
---
IMO the patches and QOL improvements have massively improved this game alone. 
---
Now I know we have only had a few minor additions to the game so far but I love what we have had. Its fun and fits the theme of the game too. The roadmap for the next couple of months has me really excited.
---
the roadmap for the rest of the year also has me super excited and im sure will keep me playing throughout. I really do trust the devs with new content.
---
Plus I love that they are listening to community feedback to improve and enhance the game.
---
I mean for a minute. I can actually wipe someone's base. That's when they seem to leave. I feel like if they had a faction based system or something it would be more entertaining. 
---
Just don't what?
---
Instead of a single 3 star perk card, I would suggest using three 1 stars. Damage total is an extra 10% more than using a 3 star.
---
This was thoroughly thought out. I just looked up the info and it shows alot of promise.
---
Hopefully this comes into light. Have you thought of making a post about this idea?
---
He meant hide from people like you  (one shot hits) because they were scary in default game. He who hits first wins.
---
I actually would like a mode with no legendaries at all, full loot. The game would actually be pretty fun and balanced, and most weapon types and build would be viable in one way or another.
---
The problems with survival are because of poor balancing and mechanics revolving around respawning and leader board visibility. A fresh start wouldn't fix that, and you don't need duped items to be a powerhouse in PVP.
---
Don't.  But it was a lot more aid than I expected to lose.
---
I'm with them. I already checked patch notes, and that's what I'm still worried about. I don't want to lose close to 400caps to someone who would've only lost 100 if our max health and capabilities is the same.
---
I tried it on t-51 but I didn't have a helmet to try it on 
---
Yeah, I agree.
---
It’s not that because you can have that damage or feel entitled to it. It’s the fact that when it does happen there’s little to do in the way to avoid it. Sure killing a SB in a single hit is cool. When a player spends their whole time in game thinking they’ve finally made it, they’ve gotten the best gun or weapon they dreamed about getting and armour only for some pinhead hopped up on psycho going “move peasant” is just completely demoralizing. 
---
Some flawed mechanic that really irks me. Prime plans stop dropping from scorchbeasts if you've learned the same ones previously. If you've learned all of them, scorchbeasts simply don't drop them anymore. They're not replaced with anything in that drop slot either. You just get nothing from then on. So learning the Prime plans leads to a loot disadvantage.
---
Could you add that to your lists? I feel like I've seriously screwed over my character by learning all the Prime plans.
---
I'm not talking about interacting. What I'm really asking is can bases be attached with impunity, or will they get a wanted level and marker like in adventure mode. 
---
I played for an hour, got to number one on the leaderboard, and promptly let a man murder me which he did without hesitation. 
---
It’s not bad it’s kinda sweaty rn. But it is fun and tense. I played on a level 5 I made for survival so I wasn’t to worried.
---
It seems like it’ll be fun. Not fast traveling is honestly the biggest gameplay change as travel time is much longer now. 
---
Thank you, I’ll wait it out!
---
Adventure.  No way I'm stepping into survival without a group to join.
---
I wosh there were some form of outfit for the freestates. It’s the only faction that don’t have any. Even a logo on a t shirt would be nice
---
Very nice and interesting build.
---
From my experience, it really hasn't been that bad. I've had so much fun, trying to stay on the leaderboard, trying to take out the #1 person on the server, and so on. I would give it a chance. 
---
I would probably wait. I didn't have a particularly bad experience, but the mode definitely needs a lot more tuning, especially with regards to spawn times. Get the weapon from the challenge if you want though.
---
Not just via the workshop mechanics. Let's not be disingenuous here. Your complaints are not different than those players who prefer the PVE play style but were farmed in their camps and elsewhere on the map. Yet somehow yours aren't "salty" because you're CHOOSING to play on the PVP server. I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy I have been reading across the forum today that is so eerily reminiscent of what PVE folks said about the broken PVP mechanics that made them easy but unwilling targets. 
---
Negative? Hardly. Floating happily in the Dead Sea. 
---
And as a side note: have you considered just switching servers? It was always a patent answer in the past...
---
This is visual bug and not calculation bug. The first damage is how much you'd deal without the defensive effects, and the final value is the hit minus dmg negated
---
I never had an encounter go more than one hit. Either they hit me or I hit them.
---
I noticed this, but I thought it was just other players spamming the 3 different types stimpacks and food/drinks.
---
It sounds quite what?
---
#2 I never experience that.
---
#3 It's what I do. Then go hide in the bathroom, crouching. I maybe sometimes open and close the door to attract a bit of attention.
---
I have an anti-armor LMG and I love it but barely use it because the rate of ammo production in the work bench is a lousy 21 rounds per batch. That is ridiculous for a heavy weapon with a high rate of fire. Minigun, gatling, and .50 cal produce 180 rounds per batch. Something needs to be done about this.
---
Survival Mode is complete trash. Shoot first ask questions later... there is no “adrenaline rush” when seeing another player because you know they are just gunna shoot you. Walking everywhere is a pain in the ass and loosing all your junk and aid is also not fun. Adventure mode or the previous game was better than this “survival”. I just can’t defend this game anymore... the direction the developers and shareholders of Bethesda have taken this game is to cater to toxic behavior. 
---
I get your point, but it was my only counter to all the OP heavy weapons and plasma guns. Thise change will bring the automatic weapons even further into the meta, and the non automatics are nerfed. Its was hard enough to take down people in power armor without giving in to the OP guns and meta. Now it feels like I have to.
---
That’s awesome I hope Bethesda implements this!
---
It's broken as fuck. I tested explosive weapons against players and they heal like NPCs did, so the damage bug is now affecting PVP.
---
It's good in a lot of ways and super promising, but the misses miss HARD. At the moment I would say it is much better to hold off unless you're making an exclusive character for survival (which everyone should be forced to). 
---
This lets you tweak your perks and your inventory management to better suite the current hostile state of the wasteland. 
---
I know it can be finicky and take a while to load it may also be problems with the PC servers.
---
&gt;  after about 4 weeks, reaching lvl 113 
---
After 230 odd hours I'm at level 88.  You really rushed it, no wonder you burnt out.
---
If you've ever played the game at all, of course.
---
Would be cool to have a market in each of the areas of the map so that varied levels can get to them without having to travel too far or risk encountering high level enemies. 
---
My weapons just dont do enough damage then bc ill head shot somone standing still and they take another hit
---
They are open to attack. I just leveled a guys base who attacked me. 
---
Now that they reworked the budget system to build stuff like this, we need a bigger or customizable build area so that we can at least build higher.
---
I would be fine with the way they supposedly have it set up already, if it actually worked. But I wasn’t invincible for any amount of time of respawn. So the mode is useless. 
---
I made a new character about 2 weeks ago that I've been neglecting (it was level 5 when I stopped). Decided to make that my survival character.
---
No. It's survival mode.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
wat
---
Yeah you basically have to have god tier guns or you have no chance. I just took squad of four guys over and over because I have guns that put out crazy damage. 
---
:D :D
---
Well no shit you can spawn elsewhere dude.. did you even read the notes?  You're supposed to be invulnerable for at least several seconds after fast traveling or spawning (until 'firing your weapon'), to combat being spawn killed.  Not a fact, not looking for a workaround, looking for the facts they claimed. 
---
Again, not even hating. Still super excited for the new survival mode.  Just want to provide feedback against what they tried to do that didnt work. 
---
Lol, they will continue to whine.
---
If you like being cannon fodder to bunny hopping TSE campers at spawn points it's great. Other than that, it's a complete waste of caps, stimpaks and junk. 
---
The notes say specifically you can only have 1 stimpack active at a time in PVP, so you actually can't spam them.
---
maybe stop fast traveling if it proves to be too dangerous?
---
So, let's say they make it so you can only make new characters. What happens in 3 months when a new player who wants to play survival has the exact same problem you're having now?
---
Even if you made people have to make new characters now in 3 months, when everyone has leveled back up, people would be bitching and whining that older players are too OP and requesting the ability to import Adventure characters
---
I’m responding to someone who is saying the game mode is ruined by dupers because of one instance of pvp where people *might* have been duping. So yes, one instance. 
---
Again, I don’t think people should have been able to port over their characters. I’m just saying there’s no reason to see one instance and say the game is ruined. Give it a few days, see how bad it *actually* is, and then make a judgement. Rather than just confirming one’s own bias and calling it good. 
---
You drop a random amount of aid on death.  This includes bobbleheads and magazines (like when I died lol).
---
Plan accordingly.
---
Semi-auto handmade is my "panicked spray and pray" for when you get swarmed  by ghouls. Especially when your primary is a rifle that has a fire rate of 3.
---
They share the same perks, so you can focus on one build, rather than trying to make a mediocre hybrid sniper.
---
What’s the challenge?
---
Yeah, but you have to draw the line somewhere.
---
Right now people are being killed as they load into the game. 
---
My autocorrect is retarted as hell today.
---
No I actually had about 30 shots on someone and they would not die, kept dropping to 1% and healing fully every second.
---
I really think they should remove the stealth/camo things from the survival game world and just have it be done via stealth boys. Clothing that grants you invisibility when crouched would be super OP in a PvP server.
---
I mean i would love the R91 as a low tier/reskin of the weapon honestly
---
I think wanted is only for placing bounties. Killing, destroying is open season.
---
Nice on the eyes and still functional. Verry well done
---
Wtf? OP joined the survival server where he knew this type of stuff would happen, not only that but joined as a lvl 15. Might wanna stay in stay in adventure mode if that was upsetting. 
---
“Yeah, b-b-b-b-but he-“
---
Nope, survival mode. This is how it is right now. Lol 
---
Lol
---
I was both dominating heavily, with longest life at 2h half of that while under bounty, and getting rekt. I think its great, the only major issue is that the spawn points should be randomized. The PvP right now is all about map control and spawning on contested train station is suicide. Movement decisions and terrain usage meant nothing and now mean everything.
---
I do number 3 on xbox all the time.
---
I suppose they lack uniforms because off their antiestablishmentarianism or whatever the word is. Though it's a shame. Some hunting gear with their logo would be awesome
---
Then people will just camp the outside of the circle and wait for you to come out.
---
&gt; A year wasted on finishing the base version of the game
---
Wait, we're in November 2019 already?  You want to tell me what happened with Brexit?  
---
If we start talking real weights, then who among us can walk around with 900lbs of gear on in the first place.  Even 300 lbs, damn.  I personally do not want this game thinking in that direction.  So it is off my 10lbs, you make up with 100s on the other side.
---
I know it's bug but to combat it just spawn somewhere else. 
---
I like this but then what does T.E.N.T stand for?
---
You can't fast travel??
---
Scorched around your level drop them constantly. 
---
Sounds like I'm on the right track.  And I get caught spraying and praying too often
---
I mean stimpak+diluted+super+food+drink, I guess that you could get a big regen boost if you combine all that.
---
Its overall more fun, in my opinion, when you can trade back and forth and use actual tactics to fight. The game of one hit versus one hit is very boring and offers nothing to anyone. 
---
Think back to the announcement trailer when the one guy starting attacking the player character. Battles like that are intense and memorable. Every person running around with the ability to be hit once, from a distance, and immediately dropped is neither of those things. 
---
Then you have armor effects that nullify all damage (nearly), and you have this bizzare broken environment that isn't enjoyable at all.
---
That's a good point, i'll edit it and post it...
---
I'd prefer it as a standalone weapon but if it was a skin for the handmade I'd love it because that gun is fugly
---
It's honestly the most fun I've had with this game in a long time. 
---
No I'm saying you can only have 1 active at a time. You can't stim + super stim.
---
Same here. Such a pain. 
---
Snipers camping is normal, its literally what they do. Im not a sniper though.
---
But I do see your point. Thing is, I have this build because players will start blasting you with some  random OP automatic energy gun in full power armor. Now because of this change, I will need to cheese fights or even build differently in order to stand a chance since my non automatic weapons were nerfed while their weapons are still OP and untouched. This change would of been fine if they also balance everything else along with it.
---
Thats just the UI of the health bar glitching, the calculations are correct, its unrelated to survival and visible in the game for last few months, you just haven't shot a properly made character yet if its your first encounter with this issue.
---
That would be amazing! I go to Bridge Day every year and it would make my absolute day if they did this!
---
Yes someone almost got me like that they were selling plans and was waiting with people 
---
Add me if you are on PS and come talk camps sometime :) 
---
I killed a guy and he dropped 65 dog food
---
I like that its the AK esque rifle we have all wanted
---
Ok, I'll give you that.  it's just as easy as PLANNING to kill random players and really not worrying about being a badass.  That's the type of people the most complaints will be about.  Good point
---
I was looking forward to this game until I read the reviews. 
---
Started playing first time yesterday and fell in love with it. Just stares out of the vault near the overseers camp I got a goody bag from a kind vault dweller.
---
Walked down the road and saw someone’s “bar” their built, was welcomed in, took a look around and she gave me a goody bag with schematics. 
---
I left to do some responder missions and headed back to the bar and she waved at me and poof like magic disappeared into thin air. 
---
Noticed a lighthouse on a hill and another camp like a condor with 3 players in power armour I greeted and helped myself to some tato and corn.
---
It’s amazing 
---
That’s pretty shady, but I won’t lie it’s kind of brilliant 
---
I literally just saw a Flatwoods monster with three purple glowing ghouls outside vault 51 a few minutes ago
---
Tequila. yummy.
---
So I actually lost all that shit I don’t believe this I’m gonna have a heart attack SmMH I GOT CUCKED
---
didn't know that flame proof would effect that, thx
---
I'd rather have the Chinese assault rifle back.
---
Let’s hope they pay attention to the feed back and actually do something about it rather quickly (unlike the beta for the game itself)
---
I feel like it'd be a smaller based faction. A team of like 4 that'd use stealth to infiltrate larger faction controlled areas, deal some damage, take some shit, and then slink back into the shadows
---
Yeah but I was already a step ahead I check before I join or when I do join I check server 
---
I did this run 8 times and only got to tag him three times. Higher levels one shotted him before we could even see which place he spawned. 😫
---
Howdy it's me your friendly neighborhood necro poster. I knew the guy who owned it, he was a friend.  
---
I can't give you the long version because it might make me look bad, so here's the Barr  summary. Dude is a high school kid who had a fun little discord server with online buddies. It got big which was fantastic! They even started a patreon to fund contests and give aways to make it even bigger. 
---
But then some of those buddies started abusing the server and breaking rules. Duping. Scamming. Just vanishing without ever logging back in. They had to be banned and now it was a little less fun.
---
Then came the exploits with no end in sight. At one point there were 37 bans in one hour of dupers. It took constant work to keep the trade economy somewhat decent. And it was a little less fun.
---
Then one of his friends with admin privileges went wild and fucked the server up for everyone. And then more friends left. And it got a little less fun.
---
And the game was getting boring. Why bother logging in to farm more legendaries when you already have tse and everything you could want? 
---
So yeah when a guy offered 1500 real life dollars to take the server that had been becoming less fun to own he took it. And if that sounds childish the dude is 16 and a high school student, of course it does.
---
The difference is there are ways to avoid PvP when in adventure mode, don’t claim workshops and keep pacifist mode on at all times. If these 2 things are done then you can’t be killed by other players. In Survival mode PvP is constant and thus more scrutiny needs to be given to the rules surrounding it. 
---
You’re the one who sounds salty btw, coming onto a post specifically about PvP and survival mode and bringing up old issues about Adventure mode. I recognize that there are some mechanics that cause grief for Pacifist players, but there are also legitimate ways, besides server hopping, to avoid these. There are no such methods in survival mode so far, you’re the one who’s being disingenuous.
---
That buzz is so unpleasant I didn't even make it to the end of that short clip. Please tell me most of the time you can tune it out and don't really notice it?
---
And that's what I'm asking for. Balance for everyone.
---
it's gonna get worse, prepare to laugh your guts up.
---
This is more than just one person.  
---
I'm pretty sure that by survival mode, they mean "Don't be a dick and camp near a low level area just to kill players in about 0.1 seconds." It's just flexing at this point.
---
It feels like it was designed to be a containment zone for the some of the griefers and those who wanted to play with their duped toys. Seems like it's doing an okay job at that so far.
---
That wouldn't fix the problem, it would make it less obvious until others got built up (at the expense of those who decide later to do PVP, or those who start with survival who decide to go to adventure).
---
That honestly doesn seem that fun. I can deal with the other stuf but wheres the skill of pvp if literally 1 shot is a kill and vats does all the work
---
This is exactly how I expected to play survival.  Great post and everyone should read this.
---
That was it. I killed a one-star legendary super mutant overlord and now I’m 1/25.
---
Thanks!
---
When a player takes action against another, for zero benefit, except to cause turmoil for the player, it’s griefing. Causing grief. The reason players cause grief is because they are not severely penalized. I’m just saying to raise the stakes. So griefers have to make destroying a camp a strategic decision. They wreck my camp, their camp might become wanted or nuked. Then it’s back to being strategic survival instead of giggling and saying look what I can get away with.  
---
You can annihilate player CAMPS.
---
How can you check what server they are on before joining?
---
I could careless about the caps it's the spawn killing trolling that pisses me off. The same guys spawn killing are exploiting to make them even more L33T. You can tell right away when someone is cheating. What a shit show!!! 
---
On social tab it shows if in PvP server or not 
---
I was stuck like you. Server hopping fixed this problem. Eventually you will get a server where the area you need to go is empty so when you get there it will spawn enemies your level and not super high from other players.
---
This changed the game for me and I've been playing non-stop for the past week and a half now that I can actually complete quests!
---
Yep, another reason to stay solo. 
---
If it has that bonfire it’s survival 
---
Stash your aid, stash your junk. Log out at your camp, then go to survival. Run around for a bit. Have fun, lose some caps. If you know what you are getting into, it is a great game mode. Most of the complaints are people who keep trying to respawn at train stations or the vault knowing they are camped, complaining that their op 1 shot doesnt work anymore, or their invincible armor loadout still died. The aid loss is larger than we were lead to believe, but if you stash most before going out its not a big deal, and you can restock from stash when you respawn.
---
Apparently
---
Well, that is Survival PvP in a nutshell, is it not?
---
I never thought of that :( guess I'll need trades to come to me or add as friend. I don't want to step even a toe in survival. 
---
Wow! Great job!
---
Thanks. I've been working and haven't gotten on much today. I don't want to get ambushed. Lol
---
Gah! Thank you!!!
---
The only way you get a “wanted” marker if if you kill someone and they place a bounty on your head. 
---
Read the patch notes. It’s all explained in detail 
---
That's terrible advice. 
---
A game should be open and welcoming to everyone, not just the elite of the elite. That's how a game goes from wobbly legs to straight dead. You need to have the ability to grow and skill dominate, which this is not. 
---
At the moment the only thing that dominates is if you have someone dupe you a crazy gun, you buy said gun (real money or outrages caps), or you get crazy lucky and find one. Theres no skill, nothing to learn, and most important no fun to that. Balance is important and how anyone can deny that is baffling to me. 
---
Trust I loaded in to his server n noticed it instantly lol I closed app automatically 
---
I was never able to one shot people i power armor though. Now that same damage against power armor is also nerfed, its not just about the one shot damage- its an overall damage nerf (maybe percentage wise). I like my character as someone who doesnt use power armor, but pvp is insanely tough with how much bullet spongey people become in power armor while barely having any downsides at all to wearing it (not to mention they can use stimpacks insantly). I get that power armor is a huge part of fallout and it makes sense that everyone wears it, but im not a fan of it being the only choice you have when it comes to pvp.
---
You should totally put your camp in a heavy traffic area for good trading in survival. 🙄
---
Blueprints work great for me. It is hard to find a buildable place where it turns green, but it is much easier then building from scratch. 
---
Fought a squad of four and they all spammed them, after 700 hours I have two. 
---
No doubt! Does it look different? 
---
I know people are going to hate this.  But I have played mmo where you lose all your stuff when you die.  Solves some of the issues caused by high levels cruising in from adventure mode and makes it a little easier for new characters to catch up.  You'd learn to only venture out with what you were willing to lose... But also add some replay value as there is no obtaining your dream gear and being"done"
---
I read the notes. Being Bethesda the notes don't always match what happens in game.
---
Yeah the spawn timer needs an increase, I think Bethesda recognizes this, hopefully.  Posts where legitimate critiques are brought up only help to create a mode we all want to play in. I’m confident in the devs ability to fix this but it might only happen if enough support is shown. Thanks for the input!
---
I love how you still manage to complain about TSE even though it would absolutely not matter remotely what they shot you with in this situation. 
---
There's a challenge to kill legendary enemies on survival, which gives you a legendary weapon (forgot which one, there's a list of them somewhere).
---
I’m sorry
---
Wait
---
Pointing (“Over there”/“this way”)
---
Thank you 
---
Greatest build i've seen so far.
---
Yeah in like 24 hours all the assholes are going to come back to PvE because it turns out they don't actually want a challenge.
---
A fist dropping a paper bag might work, or a gift box 
---
Or the fact that rank is decided by how long you live. I could go chamelion in the wendigo cave, living off mirelurk meat and dirty water indefinitely. You might see me on the world map, but good luck finding an invisible player perched on a stalagmite in the dark.
---
Yeah that's basically all it is. There is potential for this to be awesome if they make it something that isn't one shot kills only. Maybe in a group it'll be funner. It would have been better as team based PvP. Like deathmatch how Destiny kinda levels the playing field. 
---
I set it up for trading long before survival was a thing. I was wondering about the mechanics of leaving it there while I'm out exploring. 
---
I’ve had the same thing happen to me, to be honest I doubt they would care if you said sorry, probably just using it as an easy PvP excuse
---
Tune it back on from the pip boy
---
Spawn somewhere else and move tactically. 
---
Due to tool limitations, we can't determine rule 6 applys
---
Seasons would be kinda cool.
---
Bring back the R91, the Chinese Assault Rifle, and bring back 7.62 too.  I want my handmade to be chambered for that again.
---
Totally agree. Maybe a nice hunters long coat with the logo on the back or some apocalypse hazmat/gas mask suit thing. A bit like Netflix’s the rain
---
No but when you go to map there’s a scoreboard of top 3 or 4 n some other stuff idk I left Instantly lol 
---
Yeah I’m sure that’s what they mean, but will the players actually do that? Based off of how things were going in 76, no way. So to expect an easy time in survival at this given time is unrealistic. 
---
I have seen other folks post about how they’ve gotten lucky, or just played their cards right to survive. There’s really a lot that can happen, and not just a cookie cutter experience. 
---
If people are gonna “flex” well...that’s only natural in a video game is it not? In battle royales, fn for example, people flex skins all the time. In cod people flex with most kills. In Minecraft people flex with their creations. In battlefield people flex in top squad. Here in 76 people are flexing by straight murking you. 
---
If plays are being made which are acceptable within the bounds of the game at the current state then I would not whine about it. 
---
Hahaha
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
That's what I was thinking :P
---
Due to the short barrel I can't imagine it being great for birds anyway.
---
Even though you could relatively easy get hold of a Saiga here in Europe, I've never seen one outside a range in gun clubs. It is not like we have a use for it even in personal defense. 
---
Ok, thanks. :) I wanted to make sure I didn't have run back up there and get it. 
---
&gt; I guess you're taking it personally that no one likes your "mail system" idea.
---
I've suggested it in other threads exactly like this and it's been pretty well received. What I don't like is you, your patronizing attitude, your know it all mentality and your high horse. You're full of shit, you're looking down on me, overlooking your own mistakes in this conversation and putting all the negativity on me. Well you're a bigger piece of shit than you realize and you can enjoy digesting that fact throughout your life.
---
Nope, apparently it’s just one giant battle royal map now lol
---
Beth, srsly.... "press enter to continue"  it's not that hard.
---
Which is why I am hoping that PVP will be eliminated completely from adventure mode eventually, or at least highly restricted. Limited to workshops, with workshops nearly impossible to take if the owner has heavily invested in defenses.  I don't mean locking up the workbench. Just a setup where it's nearly impossible to hide from missile turrets while contesting workshops, and buff missile turrets haha.
---
there's establishing dominance, and then there's whatever this bot just did...
---
Want the rewards? Man up/woman up and take the risk.
---
Lol drop keys, since the patch today I haven't been able to drop anything - I've spent the entire evening placing anything I don't want into containers as my drop function just doesn't work.
---
There's definitely not enough hazmat options. The gas masks are cool, but they're so limited. I think even a reskinned version of the Institute Hooded Hazmat Suit would be cool. Add some nets and fishing hooks over it, etc.
---
You mean you haven't seen that episode? 
---
Didnt know it was that bad. Im only level 40, but i rely on switching from the black powder to my other rifles and killing power armored players with a few shots because I wouldnt be able to survive a prolonged fight against a bullet sponge with a 2 shot gatling plasma that can instantly stimpack.  The problem here is, that gatling plasma (or any other automatic weapon) will still 2 shot me according to the change, since it seemed like it only effects huge hits from non automatics.
---
This has been that way since TSE nerf , if you didn’t know they nerfed TSE n demo bad, so it’s not worth points to me tbh 
---
I think its the point to gather lots of players at one spot to create a PvP event . 
---
How anyone could meet each others in this big map without this mechanic?
---
Roll a new toon. Its exhilarating trying to survive as a noobie.
---
Boring people play boring mode in boring wat and are bored (and annoyed) what's not to love?
---
I've just sicced my son on you, prepare to die, bitches.
---
Plot twist: it was posted here as bait!
---
Yes. There’s always a strategy but that’s not the point. The only other place to spawn is you camp. But let’s say you want to spawn anywhere else. All the other spawns have people camping usually. That alone isn’t so bad. But someone camping can see you before you even fully load into the game and they can kill you. 
---
Do you see how that is an issue?
---
I had fun on my new level 2 character. I think you might have been a player advocating for no server wipe survival mode. It's just a BETA chill.
---
Cool, I'm going to investigate. Thanks for sharing!
---
Can't really have a safe zone in PVP games, your point is well taken, but let me ask," Do you know a SAFE ZONE PVP?"  At what point do you quit pushing a button for "READY" 
---
What I dont understand is why this leaderboards mechanic exists without rewarding or incentivizing anything for it. Other than to make you a target for being killed, as what happened to you. 
---
If you're too broke to lose caps and have no aid items and enjoy being murdered, that's cool, I guess. But I dont really see the point in it. You cant even fight back when someone rolls on you with a crazy gun and/ or gear. 
---
I actually don't like most of these player builds because they all kinda look the same. Yours is just amazing though, considering how limited the building mode is. Great job! 
---
Really? everyone here sounds like they are camping spawns or hiding. Great job manning up! Running away till you hit top 3 doesn't sound fun at all!
---
I don't want to say where it is but I found a spot where you can be on the wrong side of building geometry and nothing can shoot you, you can't really do anything but sit there but it's tempting to give it a try
---
kthxbai
---
Only train stations, camps, and vault 76. Heard of campers and what not but on Xbox it really wasn’t to bad. Someone did come to claim my bounty (12 caps) in all of 30 seconds though. 
---
Then what's the problem? Go and hide.
---
Blackbird was available for under 2 days and has never returned.  If you want it badly I recommend getting it now.
---
The fast travel is still the same as normal game play.  Your character appears to other players even before you see anything or have control again.  So they kill you on those spawn point without you even having a chance to counter.  We spawn always at the same spot at each location.   The server shouldn't show you to other players before you even see the players.  They need to tweak sequence of events between the client and server.  Or they make us invulnerable and cant use weapon for 10 sec after fast travel, to at least give us some time to even see those damn campers.
---
They need to fix the issue,  yes of course.  I'm just suggesting how you can temporarily get around it.  We are in agreement that the damage shield needs to actually last until you load in. 
---
I am like lvl 20, adult gamer, every time I am on I get killed by some asshole in power armor. I have better luck collaborating in RDR2. I am still interested in going back when Bethesda has fixed more stuff. Good drops and a better team matching system could make all the difference.
---
Technically not true bethesda just reduced the amount of every item with the same legendaries to 1 instance of that legendary. Day you had 5 tse combat shotguns bethesda reduced it to 1.
---
Indeed. It's not like they're gonna dry out.  Even with 1 skin or 2 per week,there are enough weapon to last for a year. It' wouldn't be hard to come up with new ones in a year time then.
---
As long as Bethesda considers one-shotting people as "PvP", it will be bad.
---
I collect all the limited times power armor paints. I never got blackbird unfortunately.
---
I don't specifically know how many times I participated over the week, but I am under the impression at least 30 (PC player). I have arrived early, triggering the event to spawn; I've arrived just as the bots rounded the last house, before triggering the sloth; I've been the one to find all 5 bots; I've walked with the parade (though always just-head of the Master of Ceremony); I've worn a mask at least one time; completed it a couple times while it was nuked; heck even completed it where every single balloon was popped (which I found strange as I arrived there and it was in that state already). Since I wasn't aware there WAS a bug until now, I didn't think to make a point of keeping track OR with doing things different for any reason. 
---
That being said, I know for sure that at least one time I did not get a mask and was confused as there were no bot deaths. I received many plans (not sure if ant were Confetti and until I can get the update, can't check). Soldier and Witch were most common for me, with Toothy Man being least, with Giant and Owl being second least. I received the Beret once (gold colored, if there are multiple). I received multiple Legendary armor pieces, generally low level, pretty sure Tier 1 on every one. I don't think any Legendary weaponry. Was fortunate enough to be first to look at someone's Lunchbag of give-aways to nab the Old Man Winter Effigy, so that's cool!
---
I don't think 1 week is long enough for people to nail down a specific set of variables to meet, if indeed that theory is the ticket to getting them. I would think 3 weeks would be needed to try and work out all the scenarios as there are just so many to consider. 
---
At this point, in order to "do the right thing", I think Bethesda simply needs to put up all the masks (that were drops) on the Atom Shop at 20 Atoms for Common, 100 Atoms for Uncommon, and 250 Atoms for Rare. If they're up for at least a week, I think that gives plenty of time for people to not just see their availability, but also easily complete Challenges to earn the Atoms and not have to purchase any. (I considered saying having them all be 10 Atoms, since we've already had to grind enough, that grinding challenges wouldn't make matters better... but I just wanted to somewhat keep with the sense of rarity and accomplishment I guess.)
---
I do feel that perhaps 1 week is too short for Limited things to be up. Especially the couple-days on Limited Time items in the Atom Shop. Some people don't have the time to play like other people do, and grind out for certain things, or to grind for the Atoms, or can afford to buy the Atoms. Some people weren't able to even download the game until months after release due to bandwidth limitations (\*cough\* me) and find out they've missed some really cool Atom Shop items (Blackbird PA paint for starters T\_T). Which this is my opinion as someone who ran a themed, RPG Minecraft server for over 4 years, where we had quests and limited ones as well, so I have hindsight on my side. For my server, players could at least trade a lot of the rare things, where as I can't trade anyone for the missed out Atom Shop items. If anything those should be up "limited" at an ultra-low price, but always be available in some capacity. 
---
But now I'm getting a bit off topic so I'll conclude it here :P Really really wanted the Jester mask, and also kinda wanted whatever the dark brownish-green cat-esque one with the tentacle hair was lol
---
Snort. The past, being yesterday? 
---
You can avoid PVP too... silly rabbit
---
LOL
---
It's not even on the pip boy
---
Seconded.
---
Greifers still found a way around the adventure mode restrictions.. there using gernades to kill people apparently it acts same way as cars exploding .. heard about it after a lvl 14 noob told me that happened to them early tonight
---
*That's the way you do it* -- Mr Punch.
---
Anything greater than 1? Isn’t zero considered null?
---
I played in a 3 man earlier but 1 shot is 1 shot and ruined it. Now i gotta grind for one of those ridiculous weapons just for them to be nerfed in a week.
---
Well I wouldn't consider limiting someone's attainable power a good system for PvP...
---
Indubitably.
---
You know mothman is a real life cryptid, right?
---
I would have very much preferred everyone had to start a new character. Doesn’t matter. There are games out there that does sort of gimmicky “survival” mode better and I dislike them. I’ll just wait for pantheon to come in 10 years before I play another video game.
---
i know they nerfed demolition expert.from 100% to 60%..but what im sayin is its only.giving 10% extra damagr
---
People dumping their caps on mule characters and PvPing with no real consequences but all the rewards is a problem as-well. I appreciate all the points you made and have faith that the devs will make much needed improvements to make this game mode we’ve all wanted. Really satisfied with it so far and having lots of fun but theres definite need for improvement in some areas. 
---
Actually I'm not a griefer, was a bad reference to a Limp Bizkit song Haha. I really dont participate in PVP in the game outside of getting the trophy and the occasional bought with friends. 
---
Ok I'll be on tomorrow 4 pm central time
---
Yea definitely, wasn't it in notes that there was a cool down time, I think it's 0.05 seconds
---
And still, it's the system that all the successful PvP games use. I wonder why.
---
So do you have any legitimate critiques with my post or are you just here trolling?
---
Well then that's on me. I knew what I was getting into by playing survival mode. I'm in no position to complain.
---
Just got the game and I still have a lot to learn about the game. Feels like a bunch of info to take in while starting and still getting used to online mechanics with no pauses.
---
The fasnacht man mask is obtainable within the normal game (even before the event) and wasn’t linked to the event. Sadly (unless Bethesda decides to add them in somehow, which I doubt) the parade masks are now impossible to get outside of play trading.
---
You still need?
---
Risk &amp; Reward 
---
It’s only 60 percent damage of the explosive effect which is only a 25 percent increase.
---
So if your weapon was 100 damage, explosive weapon adds 25 damage.  Then if you add the demolition expert, it’s only 60 percent of 25 which is 15.  So total damage is now 140.  Which demolition adds about 10 percent which is right.
---
Somebody please correct me if I’m wrong.
---
I can't think of a way to really fix PvP. Like. Nerfing doesn't help. But this is just insane how it's only one shots. 
---
I’ve seen mil cots at enclave, so I say live it up! Lolz
---
Not really. Most RPGs allow you to become as powerful as you like depending on what build you want. 
---
So now you want me to “man up” and go hide? Not sure this process has been thought out enough and feels like really bad idea from the get go. I understand it’s a beta but what I’m saying is I want cool stuff too but don’t want to do this crap pvp. I hate pvp in general. It’s not my thing. I didn’t buy the game for pvp. I want these types of rewards in adventure mode as well. 
---
Isn't it a pain in the ass! I ran around it for an hour getting the stupid biometric scans to actually register. Then getting further. It was kinda fun, but so angry when I lost all my junk because of the disconnects. Looking forward to actually launching one soon. 
---
Very similar experience with me. I was neuroticly checking the map every 5 minutes watching myself slowly climb to 3rd place. It's like waiting for execution time.
---
"Bounties Costing Twice the Amount they're Worth - This one's pretty simple, what you put on somebody's head is what people should get for killing them. What's happening to the other half? Is it getting given as commission to the damn scorched?!"
---
This is surely intentional, and needed, to prevent bounty abuse. If you kill me and I can set a 1000 cap bounty on you, I can then kill you and get my 1000 caps right back from your purse. By making it cost twice as much, it prevents abuse of this system, and makes sure most players won't set a ridiculously high bounty. 
---
I think your reply is awesome and you get what I was saying!  I promise you. a lot of these whiners had an unreal fantasy about their abilities because they were able to get away with exploiting "PACIFIST" or non PVP interested players before.  Karma is and always will be a bitch!
---
Logged off right now but just wondering how long is the bundle available?
---
The hate train has left the station.
---
Not necessarily, I know a bunch of people just really wanted one of those five rare masks (I myself just wanted the sun mask), so a lot more people would be happier if just some of them were a little more easily attainable 
---
6 days
---
Instead of scrolling for ore, sort by weight. Ore, bobbypins, and gunpowder will be at the top. I forget what the key is on PC. but on console it's L3 i think. it says on the bottom of the screen when you have the pip boy up...
---
Though, I would like a keyring be added. FO3 had one, but then iirc had no way of telling me which keys I had. That might bother some people. Wouldnt bother me, i get to a door and it'll tell me if i have it or not when i try opening so who cares, right?
---
Understand the difference between login servers and game servers.
---
I’ll be frank with you. PA doesn’t offer enough. I’ve seen people in full regalia get downed by knuckle dusters. 
---
IMO automatic weapons should be default weaker than semi.  Spitting that many rounds at a target is never fun for the one receiving it. The weapons shouldn’t need to be nerfed every time. The effect the weapon has and well perks should be looked at. 
---
I’m a stealth marksman. And someone raging out on chems and booze will 99% kill me. I might get 2-3 shots off be fore they blitz vats me.  It that’s the tradeoff. High range dps and should be poor melee skills. 
---
Also devs should have only allows 1-2* items in at first to start off on good note. Then added 3-4–5 stars as dlc is was added. Hey would have been a good balance to begin out on. 
---
On my second character I stopped picking up keys.  They give me so much anxiety it's ridiculous.  Plus many of them are useless and can be bypassed with lockpicking anyway.
---
I have like ten though and I think I'm just going to have to delete the character.  RIP Fasnacht recipes.  Goodbye cruel keys.
---
I think I got that one,  I can make one at your camp as well. 
---
6 days I think, I could be wrong tho :s
---
idk my tse weapon went from 200 to 220 with demolition maxed out...no way is that worth 5 points of perks. 
---
Much agreed. I shouldn't be able to wipe a squad four times without reloading. Then get one shoted by a tse shotgun from way further than a shotgun can shoot. It's super close to being awesome. Maybe a faction system? Big team battles? 
---
There's not really a limit for screenshots tho, so what i do is i screenshot each good photo i take. Then it get uploaded to xboxdvr.com.
---
Why is that abuse though? You'd loose caps from death, pay 1000, kill, get 1000 for a net loss of what you lost on death, you wouldn't gain any caps.
---
With only new characters,you would just postpone the same result.
---
Get all the rifleman perks maxed. As well as tank kill and bloody mess. 
---
I don’t want to spend 45+ caps each time I want to move. And each time I do move it, there’s a chance it’s occupied.
---
Yup, it's waay too little time
---
I just wish all the extra Hornwright Alpha and Beta security keys taking up space in my Misc tab would go away.
---
Yes please.
---
I was in a tree sniping at multiple people fighting at White Springs about 3 hours ago
---
I see this as accurate and a good and bad thing. 
---
It would mean pvp servers are just for high levels hunting each other, which is cool in its own right. A battle royal rpg in the most genuine way possible. 
---
That said it would also mean leveling there would be a nightmare and likely would not encourage players to actually "play" there but instead just pvp. 
---
It also means if you aren't forced to level there, then you won't be able to hunt weaker players on their way up once you hit max. Onr of the benefits of bring max level should be feeling advantageous fighting weaker lowbie food.
---
I mean, they're survival mode exclusives. I'm fairly certain one will be up for sale on the bazaar soon enough and you can just buy one but if you wanna work for it, there's only one way. 
---
Survival mode is meant to be hardcore. Griefing was always gonna happen on day one of the beta, and yes it's silly, but it could very well lessen over time once the grief boners die out.
---
Hey, if you didn't get it, you didn't get it. It's fine.
---
Look, it's simple. That cool stuff? You have to go through the risky stuff to get it. 
---
Its kinda been thrown around but having pvp only characters. I dont like this idea bc i want transferable builds and i dont like having multiple characters. I want to just be able to have a chance at shooting at someone before they instakill me.
---
Ok, fair enough, come to my camp,  I have successfully defended it more times than I haven't  See my post" Just because I don't PVP, doesn't mean I don't know how"
---
In between Treetops and Camp Venture yesterday I saw 2 level 18 diseased scorched mirelurks absolutely wrecking a pack of feral ghouls - Im not sure if it was what youd consider an event or not, but with no scorchbeast in sight it seemed bizarre that there would be scorched mirelurks.
---
This right here is why i want a fresh slate. Tons of players are gonna have a huge edge.
---
Why yes, I'm trolling your blatant hypocrisy. You're getting a taste of what PVE players have been dealing with since day one but it's somehow different for you because you're actually making the choice to play PVP so by golly it should be fair. Welcome to the party pal. 
---
What are the perks I should be looking out for? I’ve been saving bloodied no matter what and most 2 or 3 star drops 
---
How am I being a drama queen? People are acting like this is a battle royale pvp only mode. Its dissapointing. I don’t see very many people sticking to survival if this is how it’s going to be. Would you rather have mostly positive interactions with others or would you rather get one shotted as you spawn into a spot a guy is camping with his one shot tse gun? I bet you’d rather have the first option. Good day sir.
---
If I were stuck in the same house as you people for 25 years I would murder you all the second I got out. 
---
Please don’t tell my wife I said that. 
---
We are talking about PvP games, not RPGs.
---
Survival is PvP - we should compare it with games of the same nature.
---
If we had PvP only characters kinda how they do on Ark that would fix the one shot issue. Because then we wouldn't have the massively duped tse guns. I would bet 90% of these end game guns are duped. 
---
What do the stars mean anyway?
---
Well i have too many magazine and meds. Guess i won't touch survival for a couple of months then.
---
&gt; And because of how the game is designed, you can only respawn at 76 because you have no train stations unlocked when you start a new character.
---
Only if you don't know how to read.  Start a new character in adventure mode, find the stations, spawn into survival mode wherever you want.  Start out by hunting the trolls waiting under the bridges near train stations and V76.  
---
Are you using fireproof or dense/padded armor mods? TSE are still powerful but with appropriate counters they are not too powerful.
---
So I did hit Play and found I could get into the Survival mode and all was well. Idk why they noted the version would change, but it doesn't change in the launcher... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Holy shit I killed a guy and got 33 stimpacks and a bunch of other stuff.
---
Clear your inventory people!!!!
---
And good day to you, my queen.
---
It’s different tho idk how you can’t see that but I’m done trying to enlighten you, have a good day!
---
If you’re still looking for it I have few hundred of them and I can sell 100 for 80 caps
---
I loved the fact so many people were actually marching with the parade. It just felt like people really got into the event. I miss it already.
---
I'll always have the [campy parade music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqe3MRb3StY).
---
More stars more effects. 
---
It’s pure luck bud, just keep scrapping 
---
Given the truckload of sports gear and the volleyball net set up not far away,  could be a “fitness and endurance” vault.
---
As frustrating as that must have been it's also strangely hilarious 
---
Sorry bro. I got enough now. Thx for the offer. If I'm running low I'll hit you up and see if you still got em
---
That's the spirit! You are a wolf.
---
&gt;had an unreal fantasy about their abilities because they were able to get away with exploiting "PACIFIST" or non PVP 
---
Absolutely. And I think Bethesda re-balanced things with this latest patch. I saw a guy complaining that his assassin's cavalier armor wasn't working because he was getting killed lol.  Guess he hadn't read the patch notes saying that weapons were re-balanced.   
---
Ok that’s fine
---
No sir. Fallout is an RPG with PvP elements and so that's what I'm comparing it to. We should not be comparing it with Call of Duty.
---
You should record videos of any encounters you have.
---
I thought a campfire appears next to names if someone is in a survival world? I would just not join if they are in survival.
---
Awesome.  Aqua boy/ girl needed !! 
---
The whole point in the "reward" is for doing the *challenge*.
---
It's not a challenge to grind out legendaries in adventure mode.
---
It is, however, a challenge to do so in survival mode when everyone is killing everyone and you're under threat of losing all your shit.
---
That deserves a reward.
---
Damn millennials, expecting something for nothing.
---
Very nice
---
Great idea.  And the "sound alert" should be: *wheeeeeeeeee KABOOM!"
---
Good one. You know it’s a great insult when you use it again because it didn’t work the first time.
---
And then splice it together with the music from Biv's jukebox. I'd watch that.
---
Love the detail! The workshop looks like its straight from the game! And its realistic to! Amazing build
---
Worked for Indiana Jones, Must be good.
---
Pulawski -- not Frigidaire,
---
First of all yes it would be possible to kill somebody, it happens all the time. Also, of course builds require sacrifices, but in other cases the pay off is now way better. If I had sacrificed being stealth o could be better at explosives or something. Now I'm not good at explosives and I'm not good at stealth. 
---
Ready to rebuild the wasteland than immediately destroy it with nukes.
---
Strange maybe go talk where you triggered it
---
Please don't be salty. It's just a game, y u heff to be medd??
---
For me the benefits are
---
Convenience and access.
---
I’m a pack rat, while questing. I’m almost always overburdened.
---
Setting up camp close by the quest area, let’s  me use the nearby available crafting stations, so that all I’d have to do is eat and quickly nap in between quests. Rather than run back to my camp/home base each time.
---
Chobbam armored fridge with spall liner.
---
It's not. But I understand how convincing yourself it is makes the medicine taste a little less bitter and your utter inability to be honest easier to digest.
---
May your griefing be blessed.
---
dotdotdot for reference
---
Thanks
---
We could have said that for Adventure mode as it was before. Survival is PvP, and it is advertised as such - just as the devs intended it to be.
---
Had 2500 starting, died about 3 times, lost 500 total. IDK might be random or not but each death seems to be around 200?
---
I went back to fort defiance and tried to restart it but it didn't.....soooo it stinks
---
Unfortunately this will never happen as they have already released survival mode and yea... just as you expected. Super duper sand high levels who stockpiles and own the server. It’s cool and competitive... def not worth any waste of what little time I have to game.
---
Good to know, but I wish that had been an option. :-)
---
RANDUMB bullshit happening to you isn't fun.
---
The bounty is the worst. If you have a bounty it constantly pings every time you close out of the map. Kill feed doesn’t bother me.
---
I really wanted an opt in opt out feature for adventure mode, always wanted to stay off the map so I didn't feel like someone with a crazy camp destruction build was looking for me.
---
I don’t engage in workshop PvP but glad you’re looking at this from an unbiased perspective, thanks for the blessings mate!
---
Ok so maybe there's a max of LVL 100, then doubled
---
What LVL are you?
---
Maybe restart your console or pc?
---
I wish I had friends
---
I'm right there with ya, even made a character that will hopefully use the robot as a companion. Fingers crossed.
---
What weapons do you use? As for armpr I wear a hodgepodge, anything with weight reducing perks.  I do like vanguard armor. It gives more protection the higher your health is.
---
Yes. You need to open your settings and raise the volume. It glitches to 0 occasionally. 
---
I never compared it to adventure mode either so I just find it really trolly that you’re trying to make the arguments you are.
---
I’m not a millennial. Didn’t ask for free stuff. Just a different opinion than the pvp die bards here I guess. 
---
If you type their name in the Xbox search though you won't see that.
---
Ah and the classic “why you mad” Mate, that form of trolling died back in 2012. Much like your dreams and aspirations 
---
I would settle for a spiral staircase
---
Ahhh ok thank you!
---
I hope you’re right... I’ve heard plenty of “raiders” say they will continue to return to adventure mode to harass pacifists and level camps just because it’s easy pickings 
---
They are pretty explicit in game that it is survivor mode beta, so maybe they'll gauge how overrun it is with characters too OP to just switch over.
---
I'm done just doesn't mean what it used to...
---
That acctually sounds awesome. Black and blue with maybe a chain handing over the shoulder and looping round the hip. Hey besthesda free ideas here
---
I considered hopping back into FO76 with the introduction of survival mode, but considering they didn't make it a fresh restart for everyone, it appears I'll be sticking to other games. No one wants to play with level 200+ neck beards killing you off of the spawn with TSE weapons. Make everyone start from square one when the full version of survival comes out and then I'll consider coming back.
---
We should have 76 points to distribute to negate the bullshit lockpicking, carry weight cards. 
---
Yes and that's fine. But as a PvP RPG it should not be compared to non RPG titles in how the mechanics work. Successful games with character builds do not generally limit the maximum amount of damage allowed to be dealt from one player to another. Whatever damage output you have is what you do go9ve or take the other person's resistance. 
---
With every response of yours to my intended weak trolling, I know you are getting increasingly triggered, and you know it too.
---
So be smart, and stop answering. You'll feel better, I promise.
---
Motan is real life folklore. Bethesda borrowed it and for sure didn’t come up with it themselves. 
---
I loaded 5 shots form a TSE Lever action into a guy (5 direct hits + I’m a rifleman build) only to have him charge me and one-shot me with a melee weapon. Deflating to say the least. 
---
Ahh, I see how that can be an issue then. I am on PC.
---
Kill feed on the server I was was going off every 4-5 seconds. Someone was either insta killing or committing suicide. It might not be annoying to you but if you experienced it at high rates I know you would agree. 
---
This is a pretty good idea. I know I would pay good caps for a courier service if I was on XB1.
---
You went into a pvp server w/pacifists enabled? 
---
Dude, if you are on PC, open up the console and cheat. 
---
Thanks, doesn't even have to be survival but say you're building your base and need materials yknow?
---
That seems to be the common experience from these type of posts all day. I hear camping is a real big problem too. Sorry to hear of your experience man. 
---
They just need to do away with legendary weapons and gear all together in survival mode. And the perks that make you do massive damage while starving, irradiated, low health, etc. it makes it completely broken. Not to mention people think this is fallout battle royale so they kill everyone on sight. I ran into a few nice players in survival, but a majority were spawn camping pussies with their tse’s
---
THE ALIENS CAUSED THE APOCALYPSE! I KNEW IT!
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
---
I have heard spam kills. People camp spawn locations and kill people. Once they fix that BS the kill rates will go down. It could be toned down a bit, sure.
---
Vault 76 should be available in this scenario as well.
---
One example of a PvP RPG with one-shot mechanics would be...?
---
I am not really high level (61), but I purposely used a weapon I don't have perks for and only hit the sloth 1 or 2 times and would walk away so everyone else could hit.
---
I have created a character today, and i understood: Soon i will be in Top 3, and some level 218 will come to kill me from one hit, so, i need to put my items in the box, and wait till my queue resets :D than, repeat.
---
So, i dont see Any point for players till level 100? no, probably 200, when you will have that gear to survive those shots, to play this :/
---
I thought it will be fun.. i though it will be interesting to hide when you see something high is around, and wait till he will go away :D But you cant hide, you are marked as you have something blinking in your ass. Nonsense.
---
If they were half as rare as the rare masks were last week probably on the order of 98% duped.  
---
It’s not worth it, if you want the 5 points in intelligence then I’d recommend Nerd rage and maybe 2 points of the perk that makes your stimpacks heal for more health. 
---
This post slowly gets more and more angering as I read.
---
I’d say you are spot on. It can only boost the explosive effect, not the full damage output. 
---
This map update bug happened all the time BEFORE this patch. It just wasn't as noticeable since it was just workshops and people you weren't fighting being wrongfully claimed/not claimed and visible on the map or not when they should/shouldn't be. 
---
Still no fix to randomly switching to fists instead of your secondary weapon...
---
Stash your aid. There's no way you need dozens of radaway on your person all at once. 
---
Same here. I always hit and then back off 
---
Git gud
---
The right arm of the free world!
---
You aren’t a coward for around the bullshit that is fallout 76’s survival mode right now. Trust me it’s not even worth it. 
---
Yep.  More of this.  All good ideas.  
---
I don’t think people are being critical of a PVP environment.  I think people are being critical because they didn’t run the traps before rolling this out.  Sound familiar? 
---
I get that it’s a beta which is code for let’s be lazy and rush to implement thinking they got the drop on us fools.  What they got seems like a flawed environment and may prevent a lot of players from joining it.  Not that things can’t be fixed but seems like some major glitches right out of the gate especially the instant spawn deaths.  
---
In WoW you can certainly one shot others if you have the equipment and abilities for it and it is one of the most successful RPGs of all time if not the most.
---
I smell troll
---
My stash was full which is why I didn't stash before leaving. Was headed to station to sell some of it
---
Poor Reginald, having such an unruly neighbour. 
---
I agree completely about duped stuff but its just awkward in this game to restrict a character bc of others breaking the game. I take time to build my characters and it would be nice to see how they work with pvp.
---
From other players? Because that’s mostly luck, whether that player was on that server or on reddit that day, and if not from players and from vendors let me know how. I’m a broke boi
---
Calling it now. In the wastelanders update this vault will open and NPCs will come out. Save this comment so I can make history as a psychic lads.
---
Well they need to add new quests and modes like king of the hill and team death match in survival. Take away the adventure aspect perhaps. 
---
Survival at this state ain’t for everybody. I for one had a good run, till some group of bastards whooped my ass (I was playing alone). Good thing I was only carrying about five stims, radaway, and several chems. Wasn’t expecting to use a shitload. 
---
Lolz.. 
---
Ive been at work all day, and so I haven't had a chance to check it out yet. Is there fast travel on the survival servers?
---
There are a few locations, that are only accessible by placing a camp, building. Then if you move the camp you'd remove any way to get there and no1 could build. I think this game has way too many ways around these things.
---
I myself have a literal underground base/bar/nightclub on 1 alt that if I really wanted to, I could just hang out and no1 would be able to attack me. But I wouldn't do that because it's scummy, but I imagine there will be alot of people taking advantage of game mechanics.
---
You're thing is ok. It's just creating a difficult situation to attack you. I'm excited to build a base in a difficult positive. Place mines, traps, defence all around and wait like a mini boss.
---
Incentivize it rather. 
---
Daaaaaamn
---
K, thanks, bye.
---
Seriously!!!  They're the most interesting holotapes and all it says is, "(Radio Drama Plays)"
---
I mean having that weapon return wouldn’t be that far of a stretch, West Virginia is in the greater DC area, the Greenbrier/Whitespring Bunker was supposed to house members of congress, maybe the Columbia Commonwealth National Guard stationed troops near the Whitespring in case of the Nuclear Attack on the nation, maybe finding a shipment of the weapons on a ruined fallout 3 military truck (like this: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/c/c0/FNV_Military_Truck.png/revision/latest?cb=20110326201109) as both a call back to the fallout 3 engine textures and the kick off point for the weapon.
---
I like that a lot, I was also hoping maybe something cool happens when you turn level 76 and it's also recieved by the people level 77+
---
To V76 and trainstations. So people are camping the station spawns.
---
Grabbing popcorn..
---
No we need more hairstyles for the super mutants. Haha! 🤣
---
PS4 requires you to be friends first. Weird how Xbox let’s you join peoples games just by searching their name. 
---
No, I fucking hate pvp in this game. But this mode was awesome and I love it.
---
I didn’t imagine WV at all, had a full on fangirl moment when I heard the first few notes of Country Roads in the first trailer. 
---
This guy is a beast of a trader - has loads of weapons, all top notch, highest levels. Definitely check him out! 
---
p.s. Thanks for the fire axe and the tesla rifle! They’ve worked wonders for my bloodied build - couldn’t be happier! 
---
I don’t get why you’d expect to compete with people who play the game more and take they’re build more seriously for pvp?  That doesn’t make sense in literally any case you apply it too. 
---
Survival is not for you. Stick to adventure.
---
It has two mod slots, but no mods I believe. I could be wrong.
---
I've heard this before but u can't effectively have enough perks for everything you need but I may be wrong
---
It’s a known bug. Happens when you have two of the same mask and mess with equipping and unequipping them 
---
I don't know what kind of build those explosive users are using that can one-shot my build. 400/400/550 resistances, 45% fireproof perk. And of course the usual jumping in the air to exploit-avoid my VATS melee-attacks. If you let a melee specialist get into melee range, you deserve to die, not left-click spam with an explosive automatic/Shotgun/Rifle.
---
It worked for me. I was in front of the little chapel in the cemetery. Don't mind the church nearby.
---
As I posted prior to launch....
---
Reasons why survival mode is in a bad state;
---
* The whole point of survival mode is ruined when free, unlimited migration is enabled. What's the point of playing the so called 'hard mode' when you can just go back to easy mode whenever you want?
---
* Weapons and armour are currently balanced for PVE. Legendary effects can put players in an almost invincible state against those who don't have them
---
* Full PVP = competitive environment. Yet the thrill of PVP will be overshadowed by players coming into survival mode with gear sets they earned in adventure mode. Player's deciding to play exclusively in survival mode are at a much bigger disadvantage which will discourage those like myself from doing so making the mode again pointless beyond anything other than death match.
---
* Because survival mode is identical to adventure mode minus a few perks (20% xp and weekly rewards) there is no incentive to play this mode exclusively. Characters aren't bound and as mentioned above not many will play it exclusively because the mode is supposed to be competitive due to full PVP. Why would somebody put themself at at a huge disadvantage over others?
---
* The mode is at risk of becoming nothing more than a deathmatch arena. Player's will be reluctant to start new characters there because of the high risk and why do so when you can just level in the comfort of PVE mode. This also has the risk of killing them mode at its entirety. Nobody is going to feel bound survival.
---
* The excessive duping and unbalanced loot economy that has plagued the game during its first couple of months will now spill into this new mode. We will see a lot of top tier OP weapons from the get go.
---
* There will be no level playing field. Let me just clear this up as well as I see a lot of counters coming at this point. A level playing field isn't purely down to load out. There is a sense of achievement that comes with earning equipment in a tough environment. When players can jump back to easy mode and then jump back with the top tier loot then this sense of achievement is lost. Survival mode carries no weight, it is meaningless so long as you can jump between modes unless you think of it as a pure PVP environment. It's a total missed opportunity.
---
What could BGS have done...
---
**Option One - Fresh Start For All**
---
The simplest solution would have been to only allow for new characters to enter. This is my preferred choice, nothing outlandish its been done in other games many times before.
---
**Option Two - One Way Migration (With only character progress)**
---
This would have been absolutely fine as well and solves the issue most have with losing their progress. You spawn in at Vault 76 with only your vault suit but you retain all story progress and your character level.
---
Additionally they could have done more things to handle the broken PVP, broken adventure mode market spilling in as well as handle legendary weapons getting bought for cash...
---
* Significantly reduce the effect of legendary mods as well as create new ones specifically for this game mode that won't ruin the balance of PVP. Weapons and armour need a total overhaul so that in PVP combat there is always a chance the weaker side can win even if the probability is low. Nobody should be invincible no matter what level they hit. All guns should be effective in PVP. Of course some should be better than others but the gap between the high end and the low end needs closing for there to be any sort of fairness to exist.
---
* Disable legendary items trading
---
* When dropped, legendary items only appear to their owners. They cannot be picked up by other players.
---
Always watch others on twitch before diving in to get an idea on what to expect so you can plan accordingly. 
---
Here's something I will never get: What's wrong with being a casual? There's nothing wrong with doing things casual because you're either starting out, because of a disability (being mentally younger (like me), having a disorder which makes you tick very easily, etc.), or because you just want to see the story without dying so much and getting frustrated. From what I can tell, mocking people who prefer casual is basically saying that those people are low tier players and should just not play games at all.
---
There are even movies.
---
Whomp wha 
---
(Drum rimshot)
---
That's especially true for this build.  
---
  
---
I wanted both Incisor and Martial artist but couldn't afford the special points.
---
Lol, i'm 60 years old and I actually know who LB is, just don't allow to know their music!  Sorry if I offended you
---
Yeah. It really is. Very exciting.
---
Yeah I'm gonna try it tomorrow
---
That’s a major glitch if you ask me.  It’s basically the Survival equivalent of some tool setting up their camp behind Whitesprings Golf Club with their turrets and missiles going full bore. 
---
I would think it would be an easy fix. Make the first 5-10 seconds a delay or make you safe from the one shot crew that will just camp out and tag people at spawn locations.  
---
Help Preston Garvey 
---
Went on a 4 man raid  was tracking down the top 3 players until we where  ontop  of the server then hunted down players we came across got called hackers for busting down a wanted players wall to kill him in his base.  Had a big hall of aid and junk berry mentas handy for tracking down those invisible players.
---
Give it God awful accuracy. 
---
It’s double your level, so for me I lose 414 caps ever time because I’m lvl 207. It’s not ideal but they are releasing prestige mode soon and I think this will fix the discrepancies between levels. 
---
The thing that irks me the most is players dumping all their caps on mules and PvPing with none of the consequences and all the rewards, pretty shady if you ask me.
---
Escort Mission: The Messenger
---
Yeah but the ultimate is Zastava AKs and all of them are cheap
---
Not at all! Sorry I came off as something I wasnt I was just trying to insert a poorly timed theme that popped into my head. 
---
I like your moxie
---
Lol not a bad idea at all 
---
So...just exit to the main menu, and click play over and over and that will place me in different servers?  Okay, I will give that a try.  Because this has been one of my complaint I have had about my experience with Thai game since the second week.  Thanks for the advice 
---
Whoooosh
---
He was mocking casual players.
---
What's fascinating for me is that I will notice it, become consumed by it and start to spiral into madness from the thought of it being this way forever... Then 2 minutes later something else grabs my attention and I move on. But only for a little while, it lurks in the periphery and it's sure to be back. 
---
Is there black camouflage in the bundle?
---
Exactly!
---
Eh I mean it's kinda the standard way to do it in survival games. But I feel you. I know my build is unfairly good. 
---
Oh yeah, mines are fantastic now. I've wounded a few people using those strategically. 
---
I'm not a PvP die "bard". 
---
It's just pretty simple, if you want the reward, do the challenge. Hike up your panties and go kill some legendaries in survival.
---
I hate how the gameplay in survival is turning out, but that's not stopping me from hopping in and enduring the shitfest to get those sweet exclusive legendaries.
---
Thanks lol I think it would be a cool new way to play the game
---
Don't people run adamantium skeleton?
---
I hope not! I’m a sneaky/sniper rifle build... not interested in PvP but I hope they haven’t nerfed that stuff for PVE 
---
Imagine it with Armor Piercing Legendary effect as well as the Stabilized perk, that sweet, sweet 95% armor ignore where everyone, including players, is just butt naked to your gun. 
---
How did you get the red rocket logo on the garage door?
---
I like how it's only the raiders who actually like this.
---
Honestly I've just wanted co op fallout for the longest time and I'm happy it's here. The lack of npcs definitely is a noticeable problem in this game but otherwise I've been having a great time pillaging the wasteland, alone or with a friend!
---
Obviously so are you Sir!
---
Ha that sounds cool.
---
 Mutant slayers with limb damage and aim down sight movement speed. I can happily go sight seeing in Huntersville
---
I don't exactly disagree but in a month, new people joining survival would have the same kind of experience as what's happening now. Whether duped items or not, a fully specced out build who's been playing non stop for a month would have the same functional effect.
---
Either way, new characters or no, I'm staying far away.
---
Can't tell if serious...
---
You are wrong. The game mode is not intended in that way. New characters wouldn't do the things better. Overpowered characters would show in a few hours. Of you don't want OP toons then they need a temporary session (like survival in The Division) with a blank inventory. No access to stash with only a set of perk cards. Two or three hours max for gear up your character.
---
WoW is an MMO, not strictly an RPG. And besides, you can't - unless things have drastically changed in BfA. I should know, I used to play only PvP.
---
Ah. Yeah, fast travel should probably be completely disabled for something like a full PVP server, maybe other than to ones own camp. It's going to lead to such exploits.
---
Ive been searching for some time and almost all of them are dead
---
Yes you can and it's still an rpg 
---
Probably around October 23rd, 2077 
---
lol
---
I think a nuke drop might k ocs you off your perch... better not afk for too long.
---
If it's enabled in the PvP server you can't damage other players bases
---
How did you kill people at level 4, wtf.
---
Sadly Reddit doesn't have a crayon mode so that I can help you understand either. I'm not sure if you are being purposely obtuse or are actually too shallow to see the similarities in your complaints and those that PVE players have been making for months regarding PVP mechanics; All the while being called salty, amongst other things for saying anything by PVPers.
---
Honestly it's quite delicious.
---
One guy dropped 100 super stimpacks lol, I went back to adventure mode and gave most of them to some low levels in Morgantown.. I think it’s what they would’ve wanted. Rip
---
Bug: Crushing Blow Challenge
---
Only legendary enemies with a star next to their name are counted. Sometimes legendary enemies have 0 stars, they still have legendary in their name and drop a legendary item but the Crushing Blow weekly challenge does not count these legendary enemies.
---
I never heard it?
---
If so..that’s my bad, but after 100s of real posts even this gets me heated.  
---
Sincerely, the boy that got whooshed.

having recently made a trip to West Virginia it is totally worth it and I wouldn't have visited if it hadn't been for 76 ( also some of the tourist places I visited knew about fallout and were quite happy with the  extra business the game brought , mothman museum pretty much had a little fallout shrine ) 
---
This just happened today when my brother and I were playing.  He had Go and Inspect, and when he looked at me, he could order me to go, but nothing ever showed up for me.  He could also pick things up from really far away.
---
So, what is the reward for being nr. 1, if any? I was nr. 2 for a about half an hour and nothing really happened, save for few guys that tried to shoot me on sight.
---
So the argument is going to be like that. Okay.
---
No you can't and no it's not.
---
Ha! I bet they tough about that. New OP characters would be present in a few hours. There are a lot of people with no life out there. 
---
BethesdaPlease.... all they gotta do is listen. No one wants those op characters to come over to this mode. It should’ve been new characters only. They just won’t listen it’s depressing. 
---
Couple of months? Sounds like you have all the game to play...go do that.
---
He probably got crit-strung; crits ignore that sentinel assassun shenanigans and with an auto weapon every round as long as you hold the trigger from a crit counts as a crit .
---
That's been my intention from day one. I've got my camp in a wicked isolated spot, and run a piece of chameleon just for survival. 
---
Google it. You can, period.
---
I started over and been playing this more so than my level 127... it was nice knowing what to do, when and how. 
---
Also what perk cards to get first and what not. 
---
Sure that might have happened to you but it’s not something I did personally so I find you trolling this post to be petty at best. But whatever man have your little moment if that will make you feel better. I’m actively trying to encourage discussion to make this game better, what exactly are you doing rn? Smh
---
Using the Snap-Off tools brand... might cause issues
---
It makes you look like Bumblebee from Transformers
---
No kidding.  How strategic to simply take advantage of an obvious oversight or glitch to advance.  Sort of sounds like an argument a duper would make.  
---
I'll play survival mode first thing tomorrow and give my opinion.
---
I wonder how much more balanced would PvP be if legendary effects from weapons and armor were disabled against other players, and just act like normal modded weapons/armor.
---
Didn't need to kill, just stay alive.  The leader board is based on time alive.
---
But in my 3 deaths, not a single player killed me with a One-shot.
---
I only had a machete and a pipe pistol, so I did not even try to kill, but I am curious how I would have done.
---
That's not the intended game mode. I would love a survival mode by session (2 or 3 hours) with fresh characters. But this survival mode is about PvP, not farming loot. 
---
What about ak pistols who makes the best one? I have a thing for guns that clear the range when I go shooting. Current king is a s&amp;w 500 that has cleared the pistol range by the end of the first cylinder every time
---
I completely agree. I never would touch survival mode because I prefer to go casual for lore and fun sake but I have heard that there were asshole players that try to ruin the experience for someone before they could even experience it. 
---
Not a pvp player, but sounds like I may need to try test out my still intact bunker and see if they can get in.
---
sadly no, but the dessert one is
---
It would be cool if they rotated. 
---
HAHAHA! You don’t make time in your life to scour every detail the patch notes of a game you play sometimes?! What a fucking LOSER! 
---
Would actually be a fun event tbh.
---

---
any weapon that you can mod with a Calibrated (Superior Critical) or Tweaked Automatic (Improved Critical) receiver and suppress is now a VATS weapon regardless of any weapon damage perk cards.
---
i have several 20% weapon weight reduction armors and carry around almost 200lbs of rifles, shotguns and pistols and use them all.
---
Just noticed that myself when I went to change it.
---
My *LOW* expectations say May at earliest. But being an international customer, at the bottom of the world, I'm realistically expecting closer to the anniversary of the release of F76, November before I get pissed
---
Keep scrapping them. I finally got a drum mag 2 days ago lmao 
---
I say if you are going to play survival then it no ones fault but your own.
---
Awww man. At least give them a day to enjoy them before...well...
---
Took me quite awhile. Some of them I didn’t snap together I just lined up the best I could. 
---
Is your camp not a fast travel spot?
---
Ugh I hope May
---
I have stims for sale
---
This is what I had been hoping for a couple months. That the vaults would open and people (NPCs) populate Waste Virginia for us to interact and trade with. Naturally, some would become Raiders, etc. 
---
To my dismay, they ended up being announced as Raid Dungeons... which seems stupid if they've been sealed up this whole time (remember, 76 is supposed to be the first to unseal), as what could possibly be worth looting in them. But... we'll see where they take it :)
---
Whatever makes you feel better, chief!
---
Really wish they would fix this, has been an issue for a while. But I understand that they have bigger issues to worry about at the same time 
---
Going to try this right meow and get back to you.  
---
Played with a group of 4 we has some wins and some losses would definitely recommend backup if your going in of your out of room move some excess items to a mule character have over 100 stimpacks on my mele and in the stash with my main as well only go in with bare minimum aid and no junk players loot bags are not alwase picked up could go sneeky and mop up the loot these are marked on the map picked a few up on my travels.
---
Please don't. Keep in mind new characters wouldn't be better. OP toons would show in a few hours. You all guys are understimating the amount of people with no life playing videogames.
---
Now you are just disagreeing with a literal fact. Have a nice one.
---
Why would it get deleted?
---
That was an atom shop item briefly.
---
Genuinely that'd be great, might be hard to do with chameleon and TSE though given they have very visually different effects from standard gear.
---
I am going to hold out for that one. Hopefully soon 
---
Good idea. 👍
---
Considered hopping back into FO76 because I was for a survival mode from day one but I think I'll be giving this a pass for now until its sorted out. 
---
Baffles me that Bethesda had the opportunity to push out a game mode without dupes and they just let the opportunity slip through their fingers. 
---
Same problem will occur down the line. This will fix nothing.
---
I'm kinda pissed that people who are afraid of clowns still have to put on the clown suit to kill a wendigo. While I'm at it, helping a raider like rose in the main quest goes against my desire for a rainbows and sunshine wasteland, so I should be able to get rewarded for it without doing it. I mean, I paid for the game so they owe it to me.
---
Buying the game only entitles you to play the game. They want to encourage people to play survival and test the new game mode with gun rewards, they can. Its your choice if you want to jump through the hoops for the treat, but you don't get to complain about not getting the treat if you choose not to do the work.
---
HOLY BATMAN it worked!  
---
I actually reached the end of the parade where the legendary sloth would have spawned but before we could trigger the event a bunch of mutants behemoths spawned along with these fat glowing ones  in 3 packs. We lost a robot and failed the event. Bummer. 
---
Anyone selling a two shot action lever on xbox?
---
so playing around with it, it tripled the effects on special points (positive and negative), not the duration.  
---
I don't see any change to the other effects, like the OP asked about.  
---
actually slap damage has just been reduced to 0, meaning you cant be killed by other players while playing adventure mode on pacifist unless you hit someone back which i dont think you can do in pacifist mode anyway
---
What's y'all PS4 usernames maybe we could team up? (Level 40 something btw at least I think 40 idr)
---
I’m a level 100, I did the quest lines and I got good gear (well good at the time), I’m trying out Survival mode seems kinda meh, and I’m trying to find the nuka dlc.
---
Yeah I mean my old WASR was about 8 lbs with a wooden foregrip and a dogleg for a sight.
---
My AR10 with bipod, scope, and 25 rd mags is just around 18, idk how in the word they got their weights for an AK.
---
Can do.
---
Yeah, lol they just nuked me. I tried to hop in the elevator at the last second to technically be inside when the nuke hit, but it did not work. Lol it was a good hour and a half though. 
---
All I know is that I'm really happy about adventure mode now that I don't have to deal with any of that PVP bull crap anymore.
---
Boy these guys sure do work hard on finding new and inventive ways to attempt to troll people. 
---
Its got implemented with todays update. The no CAMP Damage my guess will be added on April 9th.
---
I hope it’s not aliens
---
I chewed through approximately 1500 .308 rounds to take out 3 legendary fog crawlers, somewhere in savage divide.
---
It was fun as hell, but dang it, I literally have no ammo for my sniper rifle.   
---
As far as I understand it, yes it's either coming or might have been today. It does still leave the whole camp destruction issue, which might be fixed next patch 
---
No, we're *playing* Fallout, so it's bugs and glitches you have to worry about!
---
Medical centres etc. generally have first aid kits in abundance, as flawlessin mentioned. Bathrooms are good as far as containers go too.
---
Where you will get way more Stimpaks than you will ever need however, would be Super Mutants. Not sure if the low level ones are as consistent, but clearing a densely populated building/area with Super Mutants will usually net you a ton of them. I play a stealth build and end up using maybe 1-2 Stimpaks every 5 hours I play or so, so if you get 30-40 an hour grinding Mutants, they add up - and weigh you down - way too fast :P
---
The downside of being visible to everyone when top 3 I guess. I'm sure that could use some tuning.  Keep at it. I'm excited to read peoples success stories from survival.
---
Sounds like that invisibility glitch popped over to survival, he was most likely a meathook or deathclaw oneshot build and was glitched so no one see him I've been invisible to my friends before relogging will fix it but until then, he is overpowered af.
---
Why would anyone go to survival mode knowing that there will be level 200+ squads to one shot kill you before you spawn in? You wouldn’t. 
---
Starting new would even out be playing field and prevent the run over of duplicated items, god armor and weapons. 
---
Leveling servers like armor and weapons would help make the world a better place, say no higher than 10 levels higher+/-
---
90%+ of the reviews so far from players saying they aren’t going back. 
---
Haha! New characters wouldn't be better. Just think a little. OP toons would show in a few hours. This mode is about PvP, not about farming loot. Although I could love a survival mode a la The Division: session limited to 2-3 hours with fresh inventory. But they never told us this survival mode could be anything like that.
---
Looks like Excavator Armor...lol   
---
I'm a hoarder myself, so I get where you are coming from. But seeing as dropping 400 Stimpaks etc. in the middle of nowhere feels like a painful waste, consider checking out PvP. Suddenly having 100 more carry weight and it having zero impact on my gameplay was actually a real blessing. Feels pretty bad with the current numbers on items being dropped in terms of valuable chems etc., but Stimpaks, ugh!
---
Were the ghouls glowing purple cause you took grape mentats?
---
Melee
---
I'm already running into full servers just with the Wild Appalachia people coming back lol. 
---
lol you jump into a sub for the game and then a patch notes thread which is literally the newest possible version to ask if anyone's still playing and he's the edgelord?
---
Idiot. 
---
This would happen eventually even if you did have to make new characters &gt;_&gt;
---
But I admit there is a problem with the spawn time kills. That will be fix, it's beta. Patience, wait, stop complaining
---
No problem I’ll send you a pm and we can go from there
---
Yeah yeah, whatever.
---
No, they were glowing in his eye beams
---
I'm down just tell me what time you get on and your to see if our matches up. I usually play in the morning or after school eastern time.
---
My lvl 81 has experienced it enough to give an outsiders answer which imo they would tell you themselves: they want to, so they will continue to do so
---
I played melee through fallout 4 a bunch, and Vegas, and melee in this game doesn’t seem balanced so I kinda am avoiding it 
---
yep.i.use nerd rage batteries included and.2 points.in gunsmith..i run at 20% health so stimpak.perk is no good to me
---
Unless you have a time travel machine, you're gonna have to wait, chief.
---
Yep! It shouldn't take more than a few tries. I was even able to get into Whitesprings alone and spawn low level ghouls one time but that might have been due in part to everyone being busy with the Fasnacht event that's over now.
---
But yeah, I played since beta and felt the same way so I hadn't actually touched the game in a few months. Picked it up again two weeks ago and someone on Reddit gave me this advice. Literal game changer!
---
Tired of typing same reply to this. You can find a bunch of other threads with same ideas and peoples opinions on it.
---
I know right?  I'm like surprisingly emotional about it being over.  I wish I had a holotape of that Fasnacht melody.
---
Exactly what Bethesda said would happen with the game mechanics... happened.
---
Players: Surprised Pikachu face
---
How mature. 
---
Yeah, but you can't interact with them in any way.
---
And yet still the easiest way to handle shit like that, is to lvl cap damage. Where higher level players can't hurt players lower than themselves by x amount, but x can always attack higher. So if some lvl 2 clown decided to pop a few shots off at a lvl 20, then that's his own stupidity an nature has taken its' course an his death assured. It's not fucking rocking science to write no more than 100 lines more of code an slap it the fuck into their already piss poor code, kick it a few times  an iunno maybe stroke one out into the console an call it a fucking day.
---
Answering in kind, nothing more.
---
Sorry that you've gone this route.
---
Is it for survival only? 
---
Sell them! Always a market of Stims.
---
Sell them back to the player you killed 🤣🤣
---
I used to use it with happy go lucky for the luck boost. It doesn't affect that. It does triple the time your high on on bottle though.
---
This game is terribly unbalanced from its core. This mode will never be good ever even with a clean wipe. Yes this is not constructive at all buts its fucking true. 
---
If you get what your asking for you will have no chance, I mean zero. Duping is still ingame, you have access to great weapons and armor now. If you get your way only the dupers will have the best gear because I promise you they wont be selling it.
---
What is elder plan
---
Lol 20, I turned in 100 just to get the initiate paint lol random is random 
---
No
---
Look. The mere account name doesn't allow you to do anything.
---
O glorious mothmen, please accept my humble offering of karma. 
---
He wasn't using a melee weapon, I know that much. He was sniping people in the head. I could tell because I would watch his position on the map, and he never got close enough for melee, but just barely close enough to get you with Long Shot and something with already crazy range. And to be able to snipe a crouched invisible player in the head every time from that far away through bushes like he could...I really think it was an aimbot of some sort combined with something that kept him off radar and invisible.
---
Many people including myself have no desire for a game where you can play "safe" and  choose not to engage with other players. I don't see being killed by other players in any context as griefing. I do however think balancing is really important and I hope that the devs make the appropriate changes during the beta.
---
Just a bigger target on the back of your head so players tend to try and attack you more 
---
I’m sitting at over 5k right now too. I still did the event though when it showed up and did a quick lap through town to get cooking oil and stuff for donuts each time as well. 
---
Need help nuke just dropped small numbers 
---
The elder T-60 power armor plan?
---
Oof
---
Yeah for PvP I’d trim the fat and throw those batters included and gunsmith points into another special tree but that’s just me and I get the QOL aspect of it.
---
I was asking the other commenter if his method of making caps was to spawn kill players at the train station. I personally make a lot of caps by finding items that sell for a good price and sourcing them for cheap. 
---
An example of this, on Xbox some people will pay 2.5k for TSE weapons. I look for posts of people selling these for cheaper. Some people will sell them for as low as 500 caps. I'll buy it then sell it on, netting myself 2000 caps for little work.
---
We have 2 TSE mini guns on her now 
---
not a PvP'er, but i thought, lets give it a try.  so i created a new character.  walked out of the vault and......POP    POP     POP!!  i am dead 3 times by people 150+ levels above me.  what is the point?  i got 0 caps, 0 aid, and 0 stims.  did NOT pick them up on my way out.  guess i griefed the griefers!  
---
I love that spot, I used to have a base under that bridge myself. Great job
---
see, I just tried vodka, rum, the hoppy hunter, and whiskey, perk had no effect on duration, only the changes to my specials
---
Make sure you have read the previous paint plan. You can’t learn the next paint until you have learned all previous. 
---
I didn't "jump" into this sub. It showed up on my normal feed for whatever reason. A developer can still update a game and nobody plays it. Especially a company like Bethesda, who royally fucked up and betrayed its loyal community multiple times in a short period of time. 
---
Wait does the level update on the ID picture? Mine still says level 1
---
Are you on console or PC? I have a lot of extra masks and camp items if you play Xbox. I can sell them to you. 
---
That’s beautiful!
---
Once camps are locked out of damage next month adventure mode pvp is entirely optional.
---
My favorite Protectron is the one stuck guarding Responder Miguel Caldera's corpse. He has the best lines, and I think all protections, even hostile ones, should have a bunch of smart ass dialogue too. Plus I would like to see the Securitron robots make a return. They existed pre-war. 
---
And where is Caesar's Legion!?!?!
---
I'd trade you an application command for a wastlad
---
ANY LÄMP?
---
Honestly, this is the best thing about the mode. Raiders can go be assholes to each other in the Asshole Universe version of West Virginia, while on Earth 1 the rest of us can get busy rebuilding the wasteland.
---
Because it marks them on the map as Wanted.
---
Yep me too, but that's what other people explained, that even when not having a bounty, the killer gets caps.
---
if you meant to say atomic command i'm in :D
---
I don't PvP. I use the workshop for the XP points, fast travel option, and I could get materials too. But scavenging, exploring and do near events is better. When you think about that, really the only important thing about workshops is the PvP. I got a lot of workshops for session, but when they are contested in a toxic way I just leave. I am not losing anything and they are easy of get in another server.
---
I have been mainly using one handed melee and I have three pieces of vanguard armor atm and it seems solid. I have a bloodied faster swing and power attack more damage Chinese officer sword as my main weapon 
---
Survival mode sounds like an awesome place to go donate 1000s of caps and stimpacks to griefers. What fun.
---
AA is for quitters
---
When you log out it resets your technical data count to 1 
---
I think it knows if you just keep on doing it. I stopped and just did it every other day and got better plans. I’ve received Initiate, Knight and Captain (think it was called that) along with BOS underarmor and combat armor plans. But mostly just everything else. 
---
I did. Still haven’t gotten it.
---
UG man.... Survival has SUCH potential...but   constant spawn kill  ?  Still One shot kills?  Its like the only way to really do well in survival...is to do just that...literally stay the heck away from everyone one else lol...  
---
Have you looked at r/fo76bazaar? You can find some really good weapons and gear for sale. Are you on xbone?
---
Don't forget, we all shave our entire body every day and literally cannot get dirty.
---
no
---
So I started with gamestop beta and then got game thru game fly and absolutely hated it same issues as beta just bought it earlier this month from a pawn shop for 20 bucks I told my self there is no way I will pay 60 30 sure being I saw they were adding new content and I ran into a wall with div 2 waiting for world 5 and raid or possibly jumping on if I can get a group but done everything I can with solo running but back to fallout since buying it for 20 dollars and waiting for most of the day to install on my xbox some of the issues with game are still there but I so far have ran into more helpful players then toxic ones mostly soloing and enjoying myself my biggest and really most irrating gripe about this game is that I just got to level 30 so for the leveling at least for me has been a crawl which is fine but come on but no it's the way the world levels to the player level of highest character around area even if there on other side of map it's really hard to fight 69 to 89 chars solo when your at least 30 levels below so have had to leave and come back to different  servers and I lose connection to server a lot witch is annoying as well but the level issue is very annoying 
---
Always welcome and thank you for feedback and karma. Another good deal coming your way soon. 
---
I have every BOS paint except for elder. And yes. Even paladin.
---
Alright sorry I couldn’t solve it right now
---
That’s pretty unlucky although I’ve heard it’s the hardest paint to get. Based on drop Chance alone not taking into account all the previous paints as a prerequisite 
---
Paying it forward, missy. 
---
"What go around come around kid..."
---
I attempted to participate in numerous constructive discussions regarding PVP and griefing issues from the PVE perspective and was repeatedly attacked by the PVP faction. Now I see those same arguments being made BY PVPers and I'm supposed to go, " ahhhhhh, that's so sad..." 
---
Watch that 1st step from your high horse lil' gal. It's a doozy.
---
How is that fun at all? People with insane legendaries from farming for hours and hours killing people that want to immerse in survival mode.
---
After reading 95% of the page and not seeing any mention of it (much to my surprise):
---
I vote for the no map marker, but as mentioned in the comments it shows up afterwards...  
---
***BUT***  
---
Air-raid sirens drone in the vicinity of where it'll land. If you can still hear the siren, you're not clear. 
---
I know it may seem like it'll be super-annoying, but it doesn't have to be ear-piercingly loud like reality, and considering you're about to be vaporized... it's incentive to haul ass!  
---
Which on that note... perhaps you can't fast-travel out *(something-something radar jamming countermeasures? heh)* and DO have to literally run to safety? That's where, as also commented, the Pulowski Shelters come in to save you from the blast. (I've not tested in it out but my hope is that you can't just climb into PA to 'ride out a nuke', so that would make the shelters have function)
---
Quit telling people to quit or I’ll go tell Mom to make you quit. 
---
It may be good but how fast it eats through ammo that you can only make 21 at a time really sucks.
---
It’s for the pvp ain’t it? I would help you out but I’m on XB1 and people aren’t going to be giving those away because of the pvp mode
---
Make neutral areas for seasonal events. 
---
You can actually build those. I got the plan the other day.
---
Christ knows how many I’ve handed in over the last 500+ hours and I’ve never seen one. Hopefully you’ll have better luck.
---
12 fingers crossed for you though 
---
(Bloody mutations! Lol)
---
Damn I really want to save my atoms, and I just bought the excavator paint and the lever action paint cuz I use both of those often.
---
Welp, time to fork out the rest of em!
---
lol, spare me. I'm on the board every day and there's always asswipes like you popping in to make both exact comments you just made "lol who even plays" "I don't care about the game/don't play it, it just showed up on my feed" pretty much daily. 
---
Find somewhere else to get your edge fix, junior. 
---
Yeah. The paint has a awesome emblem too! 
---
Because YOU lose 1000 caps and I break even. You think it's fair for someone to lose that many caps in PVP? I'm level 100. You kill me, you get 100 caps. If I could put a 1000 cap bounty on you and collect it, I'm getting 10x as much back as I lost. 
---
Sorry for the late reply, OP is already planning to purchase it.
---
It is from the enclave mission if you ever drop it by accident like I did you can buy another at the armory vendor for 1k caps. What an expensive mistake I made 
---
Missile silo state or holotape?
---
Well, it's a two week drought until then, unfortunately.
---
It would have been kind of nice if the Sheepsquatch content didn't come on the same day as the Player Vending, but what can you do.
---
There is no perks to reduce the weight of rifles right?
---
Funny how you talk about the gun and not the ammo. 5mm and .50cal weigh the same dont they? Makes a whole lotta sense
---
Upvote, just for your comment indicating people have been swinging dick. Lmao
---
I don't see why they couldn't change it, survival mode is currently in beta.
---
You are correct. Worth a shot trying a speedy unarmed build I'm looking to switch from my sentinels assassin set I was using. thanks for the thought though!
---
Not working as intended I’d say.   I was still getting one shot in my decked out PA and with DR buffs in PvP 
---
Was there even a patch between the beta of fo76 and launch? They don’t care about betas
---
Depends on your platform. On Xbox, you just have to put your cursor on the challenge and press y. I think it tells you what you need to press at the bottom of the screen
---
Oh I totally understand I am a SUPER HOARDER! Good thing hoarder police protections don’t come knocking because oh boy, it wouldn’t be good lol!
---
That is a really good idea, 200 of everything except for the super necessary! 
---
Do you find bulking helps weight management as well? I’m still new and I haven’t tried bulking everything yet but maybe I should?
---
I hope they implement the “decorate your C.A.M.P. with stuff from your stash” REALLY SOON, I’ve been saving so much stuff in hopes for that and then when I finally saw it was gonna happen I was so excited! (Until randomly ALL my plushies disappeared?! I had pretty much every one you could get 😭) 
---
But anyways, thank you for the 200 idea, I like that and I think that is DEFINITELY a safe number. I live by the lesson my dad taught me 
---
“I would rather be looking AT it, than FOR it” which is a very smart thing but sometimes there is just TOO much! Thanks for your reply!
---
Best review I’ve seen so far.  Pretty much my same experience.  I think with a few tweaks it could be exciting.  
---
Its named "missile silo state holotape"
---
Only fortify perception? Might be the dress. Int and Per might be from the Nocturnal perk.
---
You get ten turrets for your base. Have you ever seen ten turrets against a player? They'll get lit up. They might not die instantly just from the turrets but it isn't going to tickle either. With an active defender that's a death sentence. I've held off multiple attackers at a workshop numerous times with the help of turrets. 
---
Transportable Extension for Non-invasive Travel
---
The problem isnt bwing one shot the problem is completely depleting someones health and them for whatever reason not dying and becoming invicible
---
Honestly I didn't even know I had it. Does it show the new cooldown period before you can launch again?
---
Wish I had thought of that rather than wasting my time rolling for that bloody beret I didn’t get lol.
---
We still need a perk that lets you fast travel while over encumbered :(
---
Haha, I'm dumb. My bad. Quiet\*\*\*\*
---
Why did you keep spawning there if it was just a death zone? I understand it’s annoying but it’s your fault.
---
I'm excited to get so high of a level that after I've acquired everything I could ever hope for, I get a good heavy weapon build going. That hand crank gat had me intrigued from day one. 
---
I can’t help but laugh at the haters.
---
Couldn’t get your way? Bethesda fault..
---
I had the same problem, sort of. For some reason #3 was on the map but 1 &amp; 2 were not. Should they still appear if they are hidden, chameleon, or using stealth boys?
---
Or just don’t participate if you don’t have anything constructive to contribute. You’re not even attempting to defend zero cap PvPing, you’re just trollin for the sake of it and I find it pretty sad tbh. I hope you find happiness buddy because it won’t come via attacking people on the internet, like I said earlier hope you have a good day!
---
I wish i had coins to gild, or mod privileges to make this the sticky
---
TSE weapons are not even that good now lol 
---
t.duper that has a ton of tse weapons
---
Stuff like how the favorites wheel gets messed up when you dare to have more than one of the same type of weapon assigned to it.  That's been a "We're looking into it" since Patch 5.  The inability to "Inspect" stuff in the vendors happened in Patch 6, no traction on that either.
---
And then there's just the litany of quests or events that barely work at all, like Swarm of Suitors.  They found time to fix some random issue in Signal Strength.  I guess they fixed that weird too-many-Holotapes issue too.
---
And then there's Fasnacht.  For all of its issues, I really feel its absence now.  I don't know what possessed them to have a limited time event in a game that's really starved for quest content.

Oooo, that's also a good one. Mine was

I got to #1 with a lvl 5 by just wandering around the forest looking for plans... Held it for about 15 minutes too before I sat down to cook some dog. It took a crackshot team of two to take me put as I stirred the pot. Frankly I'm surprised they survived.
---
Had I been actively seeking people though, I'm sure I would have been destroyed.  But I don't see a point in finding a hiding spot and waiting it out. 
---
The disease actually comes from being on the ground. If it's a raised bed there's no disease chance
---
What is the elder plan?
---
Figures all the grief/murder one-shot duper asshats would immediately jump over and ruin it for everyone in pvp mode. Apparently Bethesda didn't think this out well.  There should be spawn invincibility for 20 seconds where you can run for cover before you can get 1 shotted.
---
Nice try! Obviously he just wants to know your location so he can slaughter you and take your stuff. 
---
Yeahyeahyeahyeah! That's what I meant we would need to trade it tomorrow though.
---
For the reason I said, to get my loot and because nothing else was close. I thought (a) I'd be invulnerable longer &amp; (b) the people killing each other would get bored.
---
As I mentioned I had a lot of loot and you lose it quickly
---
I’ve seen an Abe Lincoln before. 
---
Why is that jumping thing in the game? It looks so stupid.
---
That's because he **Exists** my friend.
---
You do ...  plus ( in my case  ) $200 caps
---
Well first off, I didn't say either of those things. I asked a legitimate question as to who still plays the game. I also did not say I don't care about/don't play it. I DO care about the game. Else I wouldn't have bought the fucking thing. Yes, I don't follow the subreddit. In fact, I've been trying to hide it, and other subs, entirely from my feeds, but that doesn't appear to be possible. It seems that you're just upset somebody is questioning the game/developer/community. Stop being an asshat and actually try to encourage people to join/come back to the community.
---
Does it play?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/bzoHxhC.png](https://i.imgur.com/bzoHxhC.png)
---
I fixed my issue by just putting on any head gear. 
---
What’s wrong with the kill feed?
---
I literally noticed it today
---
I wish they would keep the event alive one day a week. 
---
Lol whiners gonna whine. They wanted the PVP potential while PVE people told them to screw off...now they get their just deserts
---
I've had the same base essentially since I started playing. Smack dab in the middle of all the different vendor factions on a junk node. There's a cliff on one side, so enemies only ever come from one direction, and since this character hit 50 half the time it's an Alpha Deathclaw, so great for a little XP boost and black titanium also.
---
It is super hard to copy and paste. The one time I moved camp and moved back I couldn't even manually build it the same, let alone have blueprinted it.
---
Oh so cutthroats will still be keeping the raider hate alive and well in adventure? Good to know. 
---
I'm hopping over to survival after marie kondo'ing the shit out of my character, i run a raider bar, i need to be able to fit my booze at the very least! 
---
I love how salty the day one posts are, it's going to create the more realistic feel of using your stash to hold what you need, rather than just legendary weapons and armor. Instead of players wandering with 200 purified water, psychobuff, grape mentat etc.
---
FO4 really brought “key chaos” to my attention, so yes! Please let this happen!
---
You know, if it was bad enough that other players in the area were equally confused and called a truce to try and figure it out, I'd say report him.
---
I’m no longer involved with the Guard so I couldn’t tell you if they even have holding in WV. Fallout is strange world so who knows. 
---
I’d love to see a new event when a armoured convoy with weapons has stopped and broke down in Appalachia and the overseer sends us there to take the goods. And we as the good dwellers we are try to defend it from the robots trying Secure back. And have a chance and getting the gun. I think the best place we would see it would be the enclave bunker. 
---
i dont do pvp tho
---
You’ve been playing since beta and you’re only 40..?
---
Good god what have you been doing? 
---
Bruh this is a top class idea
---
It’s a rare BOS paint plan.
---
Dude... They never say anything about that. They are merchandising this like a PvP mode. I would love a temporary session a la The Division, but playing this survival mode and wating that is just wrong.
---
welcome to the world of fallout 76 where it “all just works” 
---
I put in probably 4 hours into survival mode so far and I have yet to even see any of the top three people. I don't even know what they look like on the map. Either way I had a pretty good time then we'll definitely be doing again 10 out of 10
---
Jesus did you sleep in those 3 days ?
---
Yeah, I think  they way forward for the moment is 0 caps 0 chems and try your luck. The camping at stations is pretty bad but it's the first day so everyone is in pvp mode I guess!
---
Cool
---
Is the shotgun  skin available separately or only as the pack. The price is on point for the pack but I already have blackbird paint just want something for my shotty
---
I’m just bummed out. I got 150 hours in and like no bugs then out of nowhere the game picks me as it’s next target. How lame. 
---
Honestly most of the bases I see on here don't really impress me, don't get me wrong I love seeing different bases, but I'm very impressed with this one. It looks huge and coherent when seen from the outside, and detailed/decorative. 
---
Random amount of aid items, also lose double the amount of caps as you normally would 
---
Its shows a terminal screen displaying the status of the 3 silos.
---
There so many I started at 730 with 150 556 rounds and 8000 caps and a half full stash I now have 9000 556 rounds 4400 caps and a full stash
---
No Rifle Gaming does a series on this what would happen if you nuke X location..the Pulaski shelters don't, would be cool if they did. Neither do portopotties. 
---
Ur good
---
Only players with the most kills or on a kill streak  should be visible on the map 
---
This
---
yeah, that's cool with me man. thanks. 
---
Wow, Mrs. Mods Elinore would love this.
---
As a new player why would I ever want to play survival mode? Serious question 
---
I’m only in survival to grind for the week challenges too
---
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
You play survival, try to survive lol
---
you lose quite a lot of aid!
---
Yep, I tried it, but I was losing more than I was gaining and didn’t think it was worth the trouble.  PVP can be fun, but this ain’t it.  
---
I like yours better, I couldn't think of a good N
---
A camp and a house maybe ?
---
Home offering universal survival equipment
---
Maybe someone else could make a better acronym 
---
I would get 80% finished to step 1,784 then realize I made a fatal flaw on step 2 and can't finish it.
---
This, karma doesn't matter to immortal beings
---
Yeah seriously, they datamines it. It’s impossible
---
Nah. That's exactly what Survival is about - surviving and staying alive to reap the rewards. I would've been shaking. Loved your story!
---
Same here, I was doing some inventory management when the 500 cap value caught my eye.
---
For reference, WV has under 2m total citizens and the two biggest 'cities' are around 50k, one of which is the capital
---
So you still show on the map? I haven't played survival mode yet, but I assumed you wouldn't show. What about crouching?
---
You don't need makeshift warrior and gunsmith equipped at the same time, take some intelligence points and sounds elsewhere, more strength and endurance!
---
300 Purified water?? Dont you drink, bro?? 
---
I mean once you died twice didn’t you think it was a good idea to leave?
---
I'm just glad all the gear people have was naturally gained through their own experiences giving them the upperhand... no.
---
Got any vanguard heavy metal?
---
I literally just gave that exact gun to a friend
---
Only top 3 show on map.
---
It even says in the patch notes players will not be shown unless on scoreboard as top 3 for survival time smh bugthesda.
---
People will buy it since it's an option. Sure it's not what we all 'want', but it's something.
---
I guess I had just been exposed to all the negative comments so I didnt think people were that interested! But now that I think about it, I've heard plenty of people crap on fortnite.
---
no the only equipment I have to offer for trade is strictly vanity. sorry:(
---
On the other hand, it's $15 for a handful of digital skins....
---
Close one fellas great effort 🤙
---
I'm fairly certain the limb damage still works the same as it did in F04, where they have their own health bar.
---
Gained 3000 caps lost 1000 caps I'm over encumbered from loot bags at white springs. Not all my kills but I gott some aid out of it.. too much omg I'm lovin this new mode but I'm hoarding side now cuz I'm overweight and I think I should go die and give some back
---
Because it wasn’t first. 94 was.
---
Thats amazing! I feel like mine is almost as big (and much worse mind you) but super empty compared to that. Wonder why mine takes so much. Will need to investigate!
---
Yes friggin please. I love the Zeta Aliens storyline. Could have some mothmen and flatwoods monsters in there too. Lore suggests they are not of this world.
---
Vault 94 opened very shortly after the bombs fell, started a farm and started helping people. The vault was filled with very religious people, but they chose to help everyone regardless of faith. The Scorched Plague wiped those good people out too. I believe the Vault automatically sealed, but you can find it in the Mire, surrounded by corpses and crops.
---
I had a lot of fun walking around on my new boy doing the quests over from the beginning....until I had apparently been alive the longest and someone appeared from nowhere to kill me.
---
Then I had more fun questing and I even met a few friendly players we initiated trade and I got some armor.
---
So I continued to quest while crouched for added 'realism' and after I had done that for a while I was killed out of nowhere because I had once again become the longest living boy in the wasteland....
---
I was one hour old when they came and killed me and took basically all my aid(because I was storing my junk constantly and forgot about aid)
---
Am i salty? Yes. Would I like, at the very least, the longest living marker gone? Yes. Would I be lying if I said I was still having fun? No. I'm having a blast with the beta I can only pray to Rngesus and our lord Todd that they look hard at what people are saying before the full release of survival.
---
Omg I've lost anger made so much today
---
So, if anyone has more of anything than you, they must have been cheating or duping. 
---
Got it. 
---
Wow. This is all good news...the more people spend, the more I benefit.
---
That's weird. I haven't used it in quite a while cause once you get leveled you have so much. But remember that's what I used it for duration. The liquor or beer would always end way before the timer on addiction would. So I'd use that to extend the high duration per bottle. It used to work good for whitesprings but haven't used it in while.
---
Ha, well, I work like 60 hours a week and I'm still somewhat social. I tend to only have a few hours a week to play. And I've taken breaks when bugs kept me from continuing with various quests, only returning after I got confirmation they were fixed.
---
Just the top three longest survivors
---
So that's what happened to me yesterday. 
---
I have a copy that’s yours for 200. PSN VinKramey 
---
Not a bug they nerfed cores in power armor.
---
Stalker's the dragon v.a.s.t. critical hits with unyielding armor?
---
It sucks man ik how you feel :( I can’t even count how many times I’ve been trying to farm fusion cores and then sike disconnected right after I use up resources setting it up 
---
Me lol constantly dying and loosing all their aid no thanks
---
But what about durability degradation?    
---
    
---
I suppose by the time I'm level 50 I'll have a lot of junk for repairs, so maybe you're right.
---
I did a video on it. It doesn't work
---
It's been rough for sure, dont spawn at whitesprings or watoga.. YOU ARE NOT INVULNERABLE WHEN YOU SPAWN so be careful and be prepared to lose alot 
---
Same happened to me
---
Tbh I think only players with a bounty should be visible and leave it at that
---
Just said about removing Legendaries I am totally on board with this. 
---
I believe it's wrong to generalize all "millennials" as expecting something for nothing
---
"Anyone born between 1981 and 1996 (ages 23 to 38 in 2019) is considered a Millennial," quote from the Google.
---
Are you saying every single person across the world ages 23 to 38 expect something from nothing?
---
On a side note I agree with you about the rewards, nothing in life is free and you have to work for it.
---
Ya I'm overweight already from aid I've gotten alone
---
I have the far left Toorhy mask on Xbox if anyone is interested in trading
---
Vault 94 opened one year after the bombs. 
---
Idk why ppl keep this much shit on  them lol
---
Yeah I am in the same position - close to 100 turned in and still havent received a single paint plan
---
 They do not, Bethesda even specified this with the eliminating slap in adventure mode. My best recommendation (fron a raider) is a dense mod on the chest. I can stand right beside an exploding car afk. When someone tries this it usually resulted in me depositing my junk and unloading with a build appropriate weapon
---
Or after dying you get a couple minutes of invincible status 
---
I was meaning, those other players aren't going to be short on said items. Stuff doesn't get lost, it gets transferred from some to other.
---
Well, on my first login I see little over 10 players online, of course only some I've played along with casually a bit, while most are just players I've traded and left them there as sometimes its fun to join someones game, at bare minium you can then fast travel to them if they are in convinient place then carry on your adventures on your own.
---
But anyway non were seem to be in the new mode so there's that. Like I said it my list was mostly traders so they might not represent general playerbase fully. I have no chance to try it with my main, I got like 400-500 stims drugs on me. And those things are pretty impossible to stash because they are heavy.
---
Feels a bit joke the whole mode. But, that doesn't mean all new features should be somethng I want to use. The game I play seems still fine and even better.
---
I’ve hoarded as of now 30000 rounds trying to get to 100000 just in case... lol 
---
There’s a terminal that says that people heard a loud boom and the area around the reaches over 7900 road per sec 
---
The map is so big that with 24 people I feel like if you just avoid certain hotspots you won’t run into anyone and can just play like normal without fighting anyone. And you can just put chems in your stash and carry around 2-3 of each right?
---
I glitched my way into all 3, if you want to know how shit got ruined while they were locked up I can let you know over PM to avoid spoilers
---
Have a look at r/fo76/comments/b5buwd/gallery\_with\_t60\_paints\_bos\_knightbos\_knight/
---
I've never been spawn killed yet today. Maybe its internet connection based
---
For melee I always have a backup and repairs are cheap on most weapons.
---
 be careful going there.  Its a real pain
---
Repeat that in English and with context.
---
Have a look at  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5buwd/gallery\_with\_t60\_paints\_bos\_knightbos\_knight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5buwd/gallery_with_t60_paints_bos_knightbos_knight/) 
---
How else would you trade with people? So on PS4 you have to befriend everyone you're going to trade with one time?
---
Didn't work for me, I was rocking a floating hat and a surgical mask lol. It eventually fixed after I left my console off for a bit while eating
---
I think it flags the longest survivor so you eventually get attacked
---
The millennial thing was silly little joke. I am a millennial myself.
---
What your beef with survival mode?? 
---
I get the point 
---
Yeah. i loaded into adventure mode to trade and it was a little empty. Survival mode is definately the new way to play
---
Idk I’ve literally died before the my character has loaded in on my screen. d:
---
Yeah. No unwanted harassment from being simply looked up. That’s a privacy concern imo
---
Anyone else hopes it brings in a new npc like even a different bot or different merchant would be nice. A living person no like I can’t see it. A ghoul vender I like that. Because they’re was ghouls who were sane in the mire 
---
No he didn't mean that, try again.
---
Wait... remove legendaries? So remove the entire point of playing, which is to get better loot? 
---
Why not just ask them to remove stealth boys from the franchise? 
---
You're basically asking them to render them entirely useless 
---
Do you know if that’s per session or a running total? If it’s per session you could just served hop and be incognito again
---
Pretty sure it’s agility 
---
&gt; First of all yes it would be possible to kill somebody, it happens all the time. 
---
It happens all the time *when they can find you on the map.*
---
If they could not find you, you can go find somewhere out of the way where no one will find you and thus no one will kill you.  That's why 1-3 is visible on the map - so that people *will actually die*.  Which is the point of these servers.
---
&gt;  If I had sacrificed being stealth o could be better at explosives or something. Now I'm not good at explosives and I'm not good at stealth. 
---
Then go play on adventure where you can be as safe as you appear to want.
---
Ahh okay thanks for the answers guys. 
---
Ah give it a r/woooosh from me, completely misunderstood. You see alot of that kind generalizing around lately, sorry~
---
This was one of my concerns, not tried survival yet and probably won’t bother after everything I’ve heard today. Had a lovely and productive evening in adventure mode today though, so I guess I can’t really complain lol. 
---
Put in pvp cards, mod your armor for pvp. They are not going to change the game because your too lazy to use the tools already ingame. Stop spawning at the same spot too......you have a camp use it.
---
Not sure
---
Nah, i feel like people would abuse the shit out of that. I think there should just be pvp protection in fast travel areas
---
Added u will be on tomorrow still want / need the chest piece.
---
And your final paragraph outlines the problem. You got stomped, so now you're going to take out your frustration by cheese stomping others like you were. 
---
I have no idea I dropped mine lmao
---
I lost 1 stim, 2 diluted stims, 4 radaway, and some food/water. Stash all except what you can afford to lose when you die. Its survival beta, who knows if it may take it all one of these times.
---
I still wouldn’t be interested even if you had to create a new character.  I don’t like that you see everyone on the map, etc.
---
When they first announced the new mode I was hoping it would be like playing “adventure” mode minus the slap damage and seeing every players location.  Knowing where people are takes away the excitement for me.  Hopefully the PVP crowd is enjoying it though.
---
yeah, pretty much this. I think we could do with a few more respawn points too, if you dont' want to die at the spawn point.
---
Somewhere in the Mire there is a terminal that says that the vault had an accident and went boom. The area around the vault reached over 7900 or so rads per sec. 
---
sorry I’m dyslexic. 
---
 I mean, a forcing a “fresh restart” would only delay this by a week, a month tops.
---
I don’t get how that’s a solution at all. I guess there would be less Assassins/TwoShot/Explosive/Bloodied style builds, but a level 30 camping outside 76 preying on level 5-10s doesn’t really need all that. 
---
Dont be selfish some of us wanted this for the fun we been havin today. It's not your need to see, but understand that others want it.. stay on adventure mode or dont play online multiplayer games. We all dont want to play your it your way so let us have our game mode and stay in yours please
---
I did this to not only get the Camp plans and hat (which looks great with the Bomber Jacket) but I  also farmed a bunch of Mini Nukes from this thing as well. I must've gathered 60+ over the course of the event. Plus the people picking up said mini nukes and dropping them in various containers throughout Helvetia...thanks kind strangers!
---
I hope there's other events such as this in the future.
---
Whitesprings and Harper's town. If you find a good server with many legendaries they will respawn in the same spot, some come back 30min? Later and farm them again.
---
Lol I love that shit. Get em!
---
It's the snipers motto......
---
3 shots 1 kill........or something like that.
---
Good luck with that
---
Remove any and all legendaries, stealth boys for survival with fresh new characters.
---
Then everyone is even.
---
More like 200 here and only initiate paint. Just a lot of bomber jacket and such.
---
it was separate for a very short time, now it is part of the bundle
---
Listen my man. I know you think you’re some master manipulator, but I can assure you I’m not triggered. Chill out, Dr Evil. 
---
Though i get what you're saying.
---
But it's not called PVP beta it's called a SURVIVAL beta, two completely different things.
---
Yeah I wanted to try the mode but I was mainly trying to get some new plans for my house but I could get anywhere because of this issue.
---
They're good at a few things (one of them is exploration-based storytelling). But at things like game design, balancing, UI? Not so good.
---
You should have already if you can, it's fun as fuck. I've lost alot today and I've made alot too. Jus try it before you knock it or post shit on here lol
---
May the odds be ever in your favour. 
---
The vampires .50 is a stupid weapon. I use one for large mobs and feel like a rank, not metaphorically, an actual tank lol. What lvl are you?
---
Damn :/ might have to pass for now. Thanks I'm at work another good few hrs yet
---
Something a lot of people forget.
---
I don't know why it's so hard for folks to realize you can't play survival like you do adventure. You can't just fast travel to your favorite places and high traffic areas anymore. Not without extreme risk. There are ways and means to going where you want and doing what you need to get done. They're just going to take a little more time and invention then you're used to.
---
Yeah we all been there, lost so much myself, probably more than most on here. It's just junk you can get it back. Try losing all the caps you collected as a low level player due to vendor serums disappearing. Or a whole chassis of x01 after a disconnect. The games pretty decent right now, never seen that before though.
---
Get perks that heal you without the need for aid items. Regeneration legendary armour and the healing factor will be your best friend. 
---
Also, when you first enter the bunker through the vault door, drop down into that lower floor around the inside that the bridge extends over. There’s a wrecked assaultron that’ll play an audio file
---
I've killed around 15 legendaries, and it says I've  only killed 3
---
You haven’t played the game in weeks can you play it a bit and then voice a opinion? 
---
Ah, alright. That would explain why they're all dead. Must have been the reactor.
---
I apologize for being so crass
---
Be a good boy and go play outside, will you? Sounds like you need some fresh air.
---
I say sabotage 
---
I had this problem too on PS4. I was not sure if it meant 25 different legendaries? But after killing at least 7 different types I still only registered at 4 killed.
---
My boyfriend said 2 players invited him, he accepted thinking they wanted to team up then they just fast traveled to him, left the group and killed him. This is NOT an ok loophole and prevents fun group dynamics. Anyone else think there should be a fix? 
---
Definitely not a mode of play in which I’m interested. 
---
Disagree  this is pvp st an almost unrestricted level. No cooldowns you lose your loot like you should. The spawn in invulnerable mechanic is broken so dont spawn in high traffic locations. Game mode is fine so far shitty and harsh jus how it should be!!! 
---
I dont see the problem. If people are low level they can grind in adventure mode then bring it over to survival. THERE IS NO PROBLEM
---
Drinking BlackBerry Juice and convening with the Wise Mothman has the same affect. I'm not diving into that grief-pit, daddy-o
---
Yes but with the bracket solution it could add a benefit to players who don’t like grinding and would still enjoy a pvp experience 
---
Ooh, could be.
---
They better fix this by week 5
---
Dude. I started with a level 1 character and got killed by several level 200+ players camping out in Flatwoods waiting for low level players to arrive.
---
If you don’t have any god-tier equipment Survival mode isn’t fun. Regardless of server there always seem to be some level 300 asshole camping out at Whitesprings sniping everyone that spawns in.
---
The long nv scope is like that. Just bloodied + adrenal.
---
Lovin this new mode
---
Many of the challenges have been bugged since the start of the game.
---
Wont fix. See the other threads on this for why.
---
So? How is that abuse exactly?
---
Could you link one?
---
If you dont keep the solider certificate i think it bugs out
---
You lose almost all of it.
---
If your a casual then PLAY ADVENTURE MODE.. 
---
Yes. 
---
Not basically. I’m exactly asking that. 
---
Some parts of the game have to go in order for the game to function as a PvP experience. 
---
We removed NPCs completely.
---
Looking at your pip boy no longer pauses the game. 
---
Hell, they even made it so you can’t just hammer stimpacks anymore. 
---
You’re going to tell me that removing stealth boys  (the #1 tool that will be used to grief people) from the game is a bad thing?
---
I've got a 3* level 10 TSE pipe bolt action that I bought from a vendor bot for my alt. I have absolutely no interest in survival mode but if I did play it I would use my low level alt character, who also has some pretty good legendary armor that I've collected.
---
Whitesprings to west Tek to watoga. You can also do the steakhouse if you want. 
---
Faster leveling via higher XP gains, basically.
---
Why ppl carry so much stuff on them when they k ow they can lose it??? 
---
A reactor would have warned them of it failing. Someone slipped it a Mickey and killed the all sans the chap on the pike. 
---
Staring at it right now and it's not doing anything out of the ordinary...
---
Gawd!! I dont want to be top 3!!
---
This is what I want for survival mode. The current implementation is kind of disappointing. 
---
Just be less shit!
---
Where is that thread? Used to be stickied at the top, now gone.
---
Honestly, there is just too many blow hards that have TSE weapons that will end you quick. You also lose some aid items as well as all your junk when you die. I would stay away until you have better weapons and armor. I'm lvl 75 and I'm not even thinking of stepping foot in survival for a good while.
---
I occasionally see the third bronze one but I haven't seen the first and second ones yet. They sort of look like casino chips with a pulsating disk surrounding it.
---
Bc fallout was never limiting in that aspect before 76. Having anything and everything at your fingertips for crafting or quests was really nice. 
---
The survivors aspect, I can understand. I can appreciate that. What I can’t appreciate is that Survival is going to be overwhelmed with TSE weapons. The casual player isn’t going to be able to shit in peace without someone with a TSE weapon obliterating them. 
---
I tried it once. No crazy weapons. Just my battle axe and my power armor. Started knocking out some missions. That XP gain is pretty nice. At least I thought. Once I realized I was pushing the top 3, I stopped. Then someone left and there I was. #3. Almost immediately I have dick bagels on my ass. A level 83 and a 190. Both running around without any kind of armor, but sure as shit lobbing some TSE shit my way. I’m 165. Fully suited up and character set specifically for melee and power armor. This cockknocker UNLOADS a barrage of TSE trash on me. Faster than any automatic weapon I’ve ever seen or come across. I’m dead before I can even pull my axe out. 
---
That’s what’s ruined it for me. Because no matter what setup you have, no matter how good your setup is, one asshat with a TSE will take you out. Personally, I would love to see TSE get scrapped from the game. Make it a balanced game. No one play style can obliterate the rest. But I might as well shit in one hand and pray with the other. And to all of you who pray on those without TSE, I hope you break your hand. Ave Satanas. 
---
Well then they could just grey out the option.
---
Yeah, I think allowing to play it with your character from launch was a really bad move. It's one of the main reasons why I don't really want to play it, because I'm just gonna go up against level 400 gods with amazing armor and weapons that will still OHK me. Who knows if these characters and their equipment are even legit with all the rampant duping and exploits this game has had since launch.
---
I definitely think they should still change it as a completely separate game world requiring new character creations so everyone starts off with a clean slate. Luckily, this is a beta version so it's very possible Bethesda will make this change down the road. 
---
I think the leaderboard should be based on kills, so the people who want to fight can grapple for first place, while newer players can level up and get gear.
---
Lol my b, I’ve been honing my build for the survival mode so that’s where my minds at rn. Batteries included saves lives fr, I still think luck of the draw is better than gunsmith tho for longevity of your gun. 
---
Looking at it right now, looks like it's still messed up to me.
---
If they remove all legendary effect and start fresh I'll consider it. And then refresh it every 3 months or so. Or if you die you lose a random armor/weapon.
---
I recommend looking on the positive side: all those assholes are there now, and griefing is (basically) gone in Adventure  
---
If you ever want to grind caps that would be the way, they had to have made good money killing me and with him being top of the board there was no shortage of higher level hunters
---
If nobody kills me ... eventually i get to be in top 3!  So i MUST get killed to stay out of top 3 and not shown on map.
---
Ok. Gotcha. 😭
---
Why would they? Explosive is still effectively a first tier effect as a second tier slot. Realistically, it’s still OP for being a 2nd tier legendary.
---
Understood this perfectly.
---
That’s just Instigating. None of the survival legendaries are unique. Just guaranteed. 
---
I have nothing against being a casual players if thats how you want to play more power to you! Early on I created a bounty hunting service to protect you from griefers because I agree you shouldn’t be bullied by more powerful players. However survival was created for players like myself to go around killing people and seeing who is the biggest and baddest in the wasteland, now casual players are making posts saying that they should be able to compete with players like myself who spent months prepping for this mode. You have adventure mode which is basically a pve server so I feel like I have to defend my pvp servers because i dont want to be forced to start again regain all my mutation recipes &amp; gear etc for the benefit casual players who are literally just going to find themselves in the exact same spot a month or two later after a reset. So if you dont want to get killed stay on the pve server harsh but thats my opinion.
---
Ah ok, I thought you bought another one. Well as soon as I find out I'll let you know.
---
You got me
---
Bases need to be safe zones or something, I get killed and can’t despair anywhere else cause it tells me my base is under attack, so I respawn and get insta killed before I can even move. Not sure if it’s a glitch or a poor decision on their part, 
---
You either didn’t read my post or lack the comprehension skills to grasp it. 
---
“Legendary” variants of weapons can still exist, but they would be slight upgrades to existing weapons. A regular sledgehammer (with zero stars) does X. A 1⭐️ sledge does x + 10%. A 2⭐️ sledge does X + 15%. Etc etc. goes all the way up to 5⭐️ with increasing rarities. Gives you loot to grind for and incentives without giving game breaking advantages. 
---
And removes all the magical bullshit effects. 
---
This is heavily laced with sarcasm
---
Ok
---
Until one of you gets to #1-3 longest lived.
---
38 on the character possessing it, it’s level 45-50. Now are you saying stupid as I’m dummy good or stupid as in garbage?
---
I don't have to. It's been discussed for months by those of us in the PVE crowd. Like I said earlier, "Welcome to the party, pal."
---
P.S. I'm pretty freakin' happy.
---
Once it’s powered the 12:00 blinks. No clue what it says though, I don’t know Morse 
---
Git gud lmao
---
Current implementation is wild!! Holy I had a great time! Top 4 players were all in the same party and were in a party. 3 used themselves as bait while the fourth sniped anyone wandering in then the 3 would clean them up with their miniguns/PA builds. 
---
I'm having such a blast with this. I just wish that nukes weren't visible so we could wipe vault campers
---
Never heard of Bethesda telling everyone to make new characters? I'm too behind for this news.
---
I really do wish for this also. But, I guess that’s what pacifist mode and discord are for. 
---
Does it update the challenge though? I picked some games in a suitcase that were dropped and it still wants me to get those for the challenge. 
---
Each world has its own lore. In the adventure world, Vault 76 was actually a control vault. In Survival, the vault was filled with people that had different types of psychoses. Once released one Vault 76 were mostly peaceful and helpful while the other world had former neighbors killing each other for junkyards, bottle caps, and fists fills of screws.
---
I agree.  Party chat is great and all, but doesn't work well with the game sound no matter how I play with the settings.
---
Hooray! Entertaining post sir. 
---
While I am mocking casual players that is just the superficial layer of the post, the deeper reason of it is to bring awareness to the fact that as a casual player you should not expect to be able to compete with players who spend more time playing and know more about the mechanics have better builds and gear etc
---
VATS is still an issue. And players need something to work towards. 
---
The “legendary” system I’ve proposed gives that and removes all the erroneous magical effects that exist for some reason. 
---
I got full set of assassin's been saving for survival mode. 
---
Now they gonna be worth heaps of caps 😋
---
I’m opposed to cheating using console
---
&gt; Some guy called me a lair and was demanding proof.
---
My biggest problem with this community is their blind support and their tendency to attack anyone who isn't happy with something. It's embarrassing. People are allowed to have different opinions, and just because their experience is different from yours doesn't mean they're wrong
---
You seem to be taking your anger out on the wrong person.
---
I may be that only 3 star legendary enemies count. That's the way the other "kill legendaries" challenges worked.
---
Also the other prices where very fair 300 for paint job and 800 for costume
---
No I'm saying that not just nerfing, but eliminating something based off impressions of a new system gleaned over less than a 24 hour period is not a well thought out suggestion. 
---
Everyone is burning through their stealth boys, not every player in Survival has 400 of them. 
---
Not waiting to see their impact over a longer period is short sighted and not reasonable. 
---
If it's still a problem across a significant portion of the survival player base is spamming them after more time? Then sure, maybe.
---
Guy who didn't go down could've been using, explosive resist perks, dodge perks, med X. Not sure
---
Disagree I managed to make a new character and play for about 3 hours without running into any high level campers. The process of doing the early game quests and fighting with people at the same level doing the same missions was the most fun Ive had playing the game. But then I started running into people 150+ two shotting and camping then the fun was gone. A forced restart would have been amazing at least the people against it know that they were wrong now.
---
As a character that emulates Pickman on occasion, Stabber's Point is my favorite.  
---
Yah, but I also like making soup - I also use the water for currency or for other players. 
---
Wow. Resorting to personal insults because nobody likes your idea... cool bro.
---
Lmao level 50 isn’t shit against these players
---
I got shot at Stabber's Point. This is an outrage.
---
Yep. Check my thread on the same issues.

Silent-courteous, doesn’t have a mic. Willing to trade, waves at you, then leaves you alone. Doesn’t attack your camp, might give you a nice item for free. Great person, although you never spoke to them or got their name.

I'm at 10 legendaries just doing leader of the pack.  Haven't had any problems yet.  So doesn't need to be 3*

Gamer Tag? I'll message u when I can trade it mine is tuskedcargo99
---
Preach that... or don’t be surprised when you get murdered
---
It wasn't exactly buried.  Nor were the patch notes for this patch very long.
---
Survival only seems like fun for players with BiS gear so they can grief people from the sound of it. 
---
Woah another zinger my dude 
---
I’d guess Most of the people complaining aren’t even the ones who were calling for PvP servers. Everyone I know loves it and it seems like the casual players who wanted to test out a new mode just weren’t prepared for the difficulty and losing all their aid items. 
---
There are some threads that are bringing up some issues but it’s not really complaining so much as constructive criticism. If you consider that whining then I guess that’s all this forum is because I see posts about tons of things that have to do with PvE all the time. 
---
I really think you’re conflating people explaining to PvE players how to stay out of PvP; pacifist mode on and don’t claim workshops, to legitimate critiques by PvP players on how to make the game mode even better. 
---
If only it was super easy to drop all my rifle perk cards and switch to heavy gun cards...
---
Because first impressions are everything?
---
Look at how poorly this game is perceived by the entire gaming community despite the MASSIVE improvements they’ve made. 
---
All it takes is people logging in, getting invisible sniped/melee’d, and losing a good amount of stuff to never come back to the game. 
---
Mine is simply blinking 12:00 like it's not set, which is what it did on startup.  Can you record video?
---
Hi! Are these both one star weapons?
---
Play adventure then.
---
With the map as large as it is, how will anyone ever find another person?
---
4 year on-and-off former EVE player here. If I learned one thing from there it’s that if a system incentivises cheating, people will do it. Unfortunately Fallout 76 inadvertently incentivised such individuals with weak code. And like in EVE, they’ll do it because they can. Because no one will punish them (yet). 
---
Tl;dr: People can be assholes.
---
I'm pretty sure it was the into song when it first launched. 
---
They might be crouched?
---
In survival, you can’t go to vendors or you will be killed. You can’t go to locations that people frequent, such as sugar grove, whitesprings, west tek, lucky hole mine, excetera. Grinding xp is only doable if you don’t have any caps, junk, or aid.
---
Fuck off if you dont like it dont play
---
What is it?
---
I’m too cheap lmao 
---
It wasn’t a personal insult. It was an overwhelming probability of fact. 
---
You either saw the title and immediately posted a response without reading, or you read it and didn’t understand what was being said. 
---
As evidenced by the fact that you haven’t brought anything to the table other than the fact that your feelings were hurt, it appears you now realize the proposal was a little more than halfway decent. 
---
Exactly , it’s part of the game.
---
 Finally player encounters are exciting.
---
honestly, i lost like 2k caps by getting killed by a guy with marcupial and a tse laser rifle. literally one shotted me
---
That needs to be reported, you shouldn't feel like you'll be shot at Stabber's point.
---
I've heard of a guy that got bound up, whipped, spanked, and humiliated  too. Then he went to Stabber's Point. He got stabbed.
---
Was unaware of the separate vendor caps, thnx.
---
What happened?
---
Honestly, I’ve not bothered with survival and I probably never will. If I wanted a to load, die, load, die, load, die... I’d play cod. If I wanted to battle against 20+ people in a pointless free for all I’d play fortnight.
---
I don’t want to play either of the those, I want to play fallout. 
---
Inb4: it’s a multiplayer game now.
---
I’m aware of that and thoroughly enjoy it  (lvl 100), but survival mode is a kick in the balls to true fallout fans. (In my mid 40s and been hooked since the original)
---
Why pay for anything digital at all ever amiriiht?
---
yes it is and any workshops you claim.
---
By “preparing” you mean using exploits to gain massive amounts of levels and dupe overpowered equipment? 
---
Emergency Protocols + Dodgy + Med-X should do that. Not too sure how the damage reduction stacking works though.
---
like to be prepared and i give away alot of free meds to newbies
---
What are the lego stats?
---
hmmm, honestly not sure. i'd like to own them all regardless though. 
---
Not really excited for any of these, just cause weapon/armor skins were never my thing. 
---
The things I’ve been saving up Atoms and waiting for are the Travel Sticker Pip-Boy and the Prepper Trapper outfit. Hopefully we get those soon...
---
Yep, same here. Loading is so ridiculously slow and laggy at the moment it makes spawning impossible.
---
Mr Yac same as here :)
---
A lot of people have been collecting 'leveling gear' and..... thanks again to duping......there are a lot of pretty good low level pieces floating around out there.
---
I could use my main account to keep my alt loaded up with ammo, stimpaks, etc.. I also have access to my nephew's account that he doesn't use (his uncle bought him a game that he doesn't play). I could literally cheat and use my nephew's account to log in and bring aid and ammo to myself. It just goes to show you just how ridiculous PvP is in this game. People with alt accounts who have duped weapons and armor have a massive advantage.
---
I agree with the limit the amount of aid, and for the spawn protection, maybe being spawned in the general area of the location, but people would learn the spawns 
---
Same here. I want a refund lol
---
Check your stats.  Rattle hands for example is a disease that lowers ranged weapon damage. 
---
There needs to be a consequence for people dumping all their caps on mules and PvPing with no risk but still able to reap all the rewards. 
---
There are perks that give you extra damage resistance at low health, plus some to avoid damage entirely, plus some to increase your heal rate at low HP. 
---
Also, he could have had fireproof. 
---
I suggested a while back they should have given everyone who had an existing account one free token. That token would allow you to transfer one character to survival mode for free but no back and forth. Once it was used it was used  and your existing character was permanently transferred. Other than that what mode you create a character in is the mode it’s bound to. Then they could have sold additional character transfer tokens in the atom shop to make money.  It would have been fair to the PVP players who had existing characters and wanted to transfer their main at no cost, it would have cut down on grieving significantly by limiting the back and forth, and it would have made Bethesda a ton of money. Everybody wins. But alas they do not read their own forums.
---
You might want to start picking up items in the game.  'Cause I've started selling the large number I've picked up.
---
K
---
I am aware that you are just trolling
---
If you've planned your perk tree for PvP, at LVL 50-60, you already have the exact same advantages of someone LVL 150. LVL 50 caps perk, health and action points. Maybe for lower lvls like 1-25, 25-50, but 50+ we're all in the same boat.
---
I'm nearly LVL 200, but my character is suited for PvE, I know that if I go into survival. I have chances of being destroyed by LVL 45 guys with PvP builds and maxed 45 gear. The build is much more important than the LVL after LVL 45.
---
Well if people start doing that a lot then people just won’t put bounties on people 
---
Sound like you’re have a blast. I’m right there with you.
---
If you are at least a somewhat competent game designer, you don't need a beta to understand that auto aim and very rare weapons giving insane advantage that you can buy on Ebay in PvP is a crazy dumb idea.
---
Agreed!
---
Dope!
---
were u able to find the answer to this?
---
Couldn’t you let a random low level kill you and do the same thing? 
---
pvp happens very quickly, but I'm surprised at how balanced it is, considering I've been able to challenge people with what appeared to be sentinel's armor. Also, I've only been one shot by a melee build, which is avoidable. If you're losing fights a lot, try taking cover as soon as you take fire, and utilize grenades/drugs/stealth boys
---
??? you sure about that i always do this after an update too just cause it makes the game run better but it always deletes my pics when i do that ...and yes i'm not deleting the save file just the reserved space
---
Same!!!! 
---
&gt; Serious question: What is Bethesda's motivation for rolling out this Survival Mode the way it is now? 
---
Because it's a beta and they need as many people playing it as they can find.  Preferably those players that love to find ways to exploit and/or abuse game mechanics.
---
Ya i usually play on pacifist mode and use the xbox party mode to talk. But i feel its just not the same as being on a team. 
---
I have no desire to play PvP whatsoever. Having you all off the server is like Christmas day for some of us. 
---
It is. Full title is 0.03% chance of survival mode.
---
Didn't show up for me either. Whole reason I got the pack. Darn. 
---
There was a dupe banning wave and removal many of these weapons were removed not only that many of these weapons were nerfed and not over powered at all. All this op gear is countered name something op and ill tell you how to counter it: tse? Flame proof and dense mods. Bloodied? Gamma guns. You just lack in game knowledge about mechanics if you think anything is greatly over powered.
---
Pretty sure theres actually a pacifist mode glitch going around where it gets turned on for no reason. happened to me, at least. maybe you both just got unlucky
---
Yep. Me. 
---
I was like wait.. this thing gives 4acid per scrap and resets every hour lol
---
It's not per session. Its overall. Tested it.
---
Log off. Close your application. Restart it. Log back on. 
---
Pardon the late reply, but I decided to try the drill on the queen. 
---
 Only threw 4 perk points into the Gladiator cards and a single point into Martial Artist, and repaired the thing to 200%. Holy SHIT. Now I'm a believer. What did you end up replacing yours with?
---
I lost damn near all my aid items after dying THREE TIMES. Fuck this horse piss. 
---
Never seen raider long coat before hmm
---
Lever action sniper rifle FTW.
---
Exactly.
---
Agreed. Players shouldn't know where anyone else is. 
---
High level players waiting at Train stations for lower levels to re- spawn back in and one shot lol, lost over 200 diluted stims and over 1k caps ... I quit
---
Here is man with some self accountability take notes from him
---
Then don't cry. 
---
I'm hoping its going to be similar to the frost survival simulator mod for fallout 4. Much harder enemies and much less loot.
---
second two points are spot on, and I agree that while two shots are better than one shots, it could be better. As for melee builds, they will always be rediculous because of how strength works, but they're outplayable by running, cryo grenades/mines, ect... 
---
I’d like at least higher level mole miners max lvl40? Seems too low compared to lvl68 scorched and mutants 
---
So our heavy weapons are still going to nerfed. They will then still have a laughable damage output, causing one to eat up ammo. You should change the title of "heavy weapons" to "noise makers" or pee shooters.
---
Looks fun. I always hated pvp anyways. This makes me never wanna touch survival 
---
Good list. Thanks 
---
Insert but aliens meme here...
---
No. Patch notes even say u can use existing characters
---
Impossible. The issue is moving items between normal and survival. If each can’t play on the other mode then you can’t transport items between and cheat the progression on survival. 
---
I’m not gonna lie I tried it at the right now finally got out of that.  Earned about 1000 caps but it’s on unsporting and kinda not fun 
---
Nice job, much appreciated even at lvl 101!
---
There’s one with strangler bloom and it’s just a beer.
---
I don’t know what you’re talking about tbh. I have 45% fireproof and 400/400/500 + PA resists and they can still bring you to death in the blink of an eye. Practically a one shot.
---
Full of campers. Sounds like a perfect opportunity.  Go to Adventure server. Move your camp just to southeast of Blackwater Mine but don't build anything. Sign out, and join PvP server. You are now in an elevated position above the Whitesprings station. Pop a berry mentat and hunt done the campers.
---
Adapt and overcome.
---
*used to deal slap damage
---
Although he was in PA so he could'nt be using a bolstering/bloodied armor/weapon build. Also I think the agility dodge perks work only without PA, only serendipity and nerd rage perks would be useful.
---
The same way people stumble upon each other without looking at the map in adventure mode. Players naturally gravitate towards points of interest like events, quest areas, vendors, etc.
---
2nd idea is fine, but level brackets (which a lot of people seem to be suggesting) would be incredibly inconvenient for playing with friends, trading, teaming up, or being able to feel a clear sense of progression against other players. It also doesnt fix the issue, because players WILL just buy or grind legendaries to give to a lvl 30 or so character that let them have a huge advantage over others

ok im sending you a friend request my psn is DollynhoBR02
---
Because the other player wasted caps that you and your friend get to keep anyways.
---
With a friend, you get some of the money back. basically, the other person places a bounty on you, and you ultimately just end up getting more money
---
Missing for me as well. Looks like it's time to send in the tickets and emails....
---
I didn't do it. I saw how hard it was to get the mask so I didn't bother. : /
---
Sure, I'll ask. Bethesda, please remove stealth boy from the franchise. It's a stupid item that has no place in PvP.
---
Weird, i was level 2 and immediately got shanked by a level 85
---
I was thinking you could implement a something like the divisions dark zone where it scales to the players ranks and it pairs you with other people in groups on the situation of people buying legendaries or giving them to thirties level lock will keep most insane weapons away but anything else there is nothing you could do unless Bethesda added the introduction of universal gun level and effects for survival mode which would be annoying to higher levels and destroy the point
---
I had a similar experience learning those in that order in the same day or two.  But I've turned in 30+ TD since with no Paladin or Elder
---
this entire post is sarcasm...
---
They made a mistake when the game was released and wapped with the initial paint. It's not like they don't mess up some times haha.
---
Spawn camping will literally ruin survival. 
---
I guess they changed that after people crying because they don't want to start a new character..
---
The "top 3" are visible so that they actually have to fight someone.  Ya know, the thing people claimed they wanted from PVP in the game.  Apparently, y'all wanted to pretend to be tough without actually taking any risks.
---
So, go ahead and game it.  Put on aquaboy/girl, go into one of the flooded mines, position yourself behind a corner or two from places where people can stand, and you too can never die, even while you're visible on the map.  You'll be perfectly safe while scoring internet points about being tough enough to play on survival.  Look at you atop the longest lived leaderboard!!
---
I know but it’s more the gear also I have as well have a pve build I use but at least for the sake of the below 50s it should be bracketed

How? Lied to? You must be living the fast life then.
---
Even if they did they'd only be delaying the behavior described in the original post, saying "your character is limited to one gamemode" means literally nothing after farming for a while.
---
Yep. It’s turned into gta online faster than gta 5 turned into gta online
---
I dont blame ya, I'm stingy with my caps as well
---
FYI, the parenthesis in your link URL messes it up.
---
try ending with backslash before the first one, like this: 
---
     \))
---
Huh so I guess the legendary vendor is in the game after all
---
Yeah that I agree with. Either; 1-25,26-50 or 1-20, 21-40, 41-60.
---
 The combo I've seen be deadly is pairing black powder weapons. Hit with the pistol to start and try to get them to between 50-60% health, then switch to rifle and blow their head off. The biggest annoyance(s) are life saving and auto stim armor, and their associated perks. 
---
A bloody ripper!
---
I didn’t even know there were wings other than the military one until I was level 120, don’t feel bad lol.
---
Ahh that happened to me i got to level 7, even met a few friendlies, then after an hour or so i got murked by the guy on top......good thing I was in my camp......where he waited. So i went to the vault and began my journey anew, beat part was my camp was just a stash box I clipped into a tree so all my stuff was safe 😂
---
White knights? So people who want a fair game without bullshit glitches are white knights? Okay my guy
---
I had him a while back. Ran away from enemies the whole time
---
this joke would make sense if it was called "get spawn killed over and over mode"...  but it's not, it's called survival mode...
---
They made a mistake when the game was released and wapped with the initial paint. (Prototype X-01 hint) It's not like they don't mess up some times haha. Or maybe they didn't have the time to finish it before the game was pushed out.
---
This is a game changer..... 
---
I’m saying it’s stupid as in I have one and it’s awesome. Get a mob to surround you and let rip, with the rate of fire it has you heal faster than you can take damage. It’s by Fay my favourite weapon in the game (and I have several TSE weapons). If you have room in your stash it’s worth keeping, especially as it only weighs about 2lbs with bear arms X3. It’ll be handy to have for farming westek and whitesprings. 
---
Augh, that would have been a better post title. XD
---
Happy cake day!
---
Yeah I don't feel bad for you cause they put it in the patch notes and when they first talked about survival mode that you can drop aid upon death. Go back to adventure if you can't handle it then
---
Never thought of this. I usually just take a picture of myself as I travel through new places.
---
Thanks haha
---
That'd be neat to be able to put a little scouting camp/outpost out there that could serve as basically a respawn point or a strategical teleport point away from wherever your main camp is.  Though it should still require the same relocate fees as a normal CAMP just so it's not too heavily used as a spot to keep respawning at.  
---
Nah I think it's kinda shit, I just jumped a lvl 20 and they 1 shot me, I'm lvl 62
---
Bethesda, hire this man.
---
Yep. https://youtu.be/QALzQWqkJt4
---
Anyone mini-nuke the robots halfway through the parade on you? 
---
After having two different players do that on two different servers, I kinda feel like it would have been nice to allow them to be repaired.
---
List top 3 killers, do not show anyone on the map. Let the players know the names of the top 3 and have that nagging fear you will bump into them while you are busy scrapping junks.  
---
Most builds *can* be completed at lvl 50-60 and many 100+ players still lack decent legendaries. You are able to 1-2 hit people in max lvl pa while using a 1*Lvl 35 Gaussrifle.(If your build is decent)
---
There is supposed to be an immunity period after fast traveling or respawning. Is it not working properly?
---
Even with a bounty, at most I think it should only update the blip every few minutes, so it's more of a last known position and not a death sentence.
---
yeah I went to see it and noticed that tonight
---
They made it clear you can switch between adventure and survival with existing characters. Shared process. Sorry mate :(
---
Just don’t spawn there a lot and make sure to be there as little as possible if you are wanted or one of the top 3, that way nobody will go there 
---
Sometimes when you load out and load back in it’ll give you a different quest, has happened to me a couple times.  This one is a pain but you can get some when the Strangler quest is active, just have to be diligent when it spawns! 
---
I knew hanging onto that furious LMG was a good idea.
---
The leaderboard exists so that you actually have to take risk to play in survival mode.
---
Consider the OP's story if there were no markers for the top 3 longest lived.  He would play the same, cautious way, and thus take virtually no risk.
---
I just assign them to the weapons wheel thing, three guns, a melee, 3 nade types, then food, water, stimpack
---
I found it somewhere. Can't quite remember where😬. So it's found around the world in some places as well. Maybe from workshop defenses things? Sorry I couldn't be of more help 
---
I know but why I don't see it?
---
i can't log on on pc anymore. i port forwarded as well.
---
I log in and instantly says "disconnected from server"
---
The only thing that makes me sad about this event is that it only lasted a week and I only bothered to check it out at the tail-end.  
---
Hoping they do more stuff like this in the future and maybe consider extending it two two weeks instead of one.  
---
Mine sounds like a buzz in my brain. Medication side effect caused it two years ago. Have never had complete silence since.
---
seriously, and how are you going to do any questing while in the top 3?  what if you didn't notice you were even in the top 3?  it makes zero sense to me...
---
Even things beyond stims and radaway?
---
i got camped by a lv70 in the overseer camp with my new character and lost all my 5 stimpank and shit they give you from the vault, then i close and played adventure mode with my 130lv character
---
I literally could not care less enough about you not caring. Woohoo. Go you! 
---
Yeah, no :P It's kinda cluttered for me. Could you be a pal and link it? &lt;3
---
level 43 here, i made  a hardened handmade with a  drum magazine, great for when you get mobbed by ghouls 
---
You obviously cared enough about my not caring to reply but okay 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I just... Have it. I must have found it really early on, because I don't remember learning it.
---
COOL STORY BROOOOOOO
---
Don’t, you will regret it
---
Dumb question I only ask to cover all grounds but did you read the plan? Lol 
---
Lmaooooo go away whiny lil bitch
---
It is not working properly. Makes survival unplayable. 
---
feels nice to do all those things from the start, plus you level pretty fast and i want to change completely my deck from melee to just pure sneaky sniper, can't do that on my main.
---
You sound like the type of person to abuse this nonsense. 
---
Similar experiences to a lot of people.  My favorite is crashing when eating pre-packaged food I've looted (Salisbury Steak, Blamco, etc..)
---
Im loving the survival mode been running around killing people getting shit tons of meds and cash everyone keeps bitching about peoople with one shot weapons but just play adventure if thats the case? Survival is a good gamemode if u want to kill players but not feel like a dick 😁 alot of people are gonna be pissed of about me saying this but its how pvp is in this game untill they fix it but doesnt stop it from being fun
---
Do you have the relevant lvl crafting perk? They won’t show with out it.
---
(also the perk has to be active btw)
---
They weigh too much to he worthwhile to me. 
---
Poor salty whiny lil bitch baby :( go back to adventure since you obviously suck at PVP, from the sounds of it lol
---
Dang. That sucks. Hopefully they will get it fixed sooner rather than later
---
The invulnerability period is there, but it takes so long to fully load in that it runs out before you're able to move your character.
---
I like this idea best. I think bounty’s are interesting and good, but an ever present Icon is asinine. You could literally be walking across the field and get sniped or sneaked up on and bloodied with an unarmed build. It’s not fair.
---
Yeah, it seems very odd to make a new mode that's PvP-heavier and then... just let everyone in regardless of whether or not they're level 200+ with duped legendaries and so on.  Seems like it goes against the very nature of a survival server.  
---
Though it's not even really a "survival server" I guess since that would imply there's higher stakes on the line (i.e. permadeath).  
---
Invincibly in fast travel and respawns is supposed to a feature. It’s in the patch notes. It’s broken. The devs somehow managed to not check that the most important feature of survival mode is not working. 
---
no i was doing full damage for a fact
---
Nope I agree with you! I personally could not handle playing in survival mode, as I like to keep to myself for the most part, so  I'm keeping my happy pacifist ass in adventure mode 🤷🏻‍♀️ simple as that!! Glad to hear someone is enjoying survival mode, so far you're the first one I've heard who likes it haha

At work so only got 3.
---
I never passed an hour without a random psycho came for me 
---
Yup, that’s another way survival mode has ruined a perfectly good (albeit flawed but brilliant) game.
---
I lost my 200 cream
---
It’s definitely known. If you walk on the highway out of watoga you will eventually walk upon a hole in the road. The tunnel follows underneath the road and has a few exits the last being at big town. 
---
Usually super mutants, mongrels, crickets, and mole rats in there. Also some aid.
---
K thanks
---
I made 18k caps, yeet. Lots of dog food and other goodies!!
---
Cheat progression? It’s a mode you can opt in and out of. If you make the choice to go on to the mode without the proper preparation, then that’s your fault. The only cheat of progression I see is you making this silly notion to take away peoples hours of hard work because it’s “not fair”. That’s were this double mode comes into play. You grind  or trade for that TSE or Bloodied weapon in Adventure and hop on to Survival to bust some heads. Does it need tweaking, of course. Balance where balance is needed, but locking someone out of a character they sunk hours of playtime into is just nonsense. The only exception to this is are those with illegitimate items, but that is something that can be overcome with time and price punishing those who actually worked for their items as well it make this a real problem.
---
i dont understand..it costs caps to place a bounty..then the person who has the bounty on them loses caps..how does anyone profit from that?
---
Well the whole point of having 2 modes is ones for people who want to have fun and just level and the other one is for more experienced players who had their fun finished all quests in the game done every event and just want to pvp without annoying players who dont want to pvp
---
Fast travel to multiple spots within the area I did the burning mine and it worked for me 
---
I'm going to lose aid when I die? I have over 500 pounds of meds and supplies in aid so that's annoying.
---
A low-level player loses a small amount of caps when they die. A high-level loses a large amount. Sure, there's no disincentive, but there's not much incentive, either, and level scaling means that you stand to do more damage than you deserve. 
---
Killing a low-level might be more trouble than it's worth. 
---
Honestly I would have a blast with surprise missiles even on the regular mode. All we should hear is like a cartoonish missile whistling before we get blown up! 
---
COOL STORY BROOOOO
---
Yeah I did is there a perk I need 
---
Which one is it? 
---
As somebody who was running a Heavy build aince the beginning (advantage: you get to carry a whole bunch of guns with you to every battle), mmm those Heavy buffs were just the best
---
So true! I like the way you put it
---
Idk if it's any different for Xbox or PC but this 50 snaps is way worse on ps4 if more than one user plays fallout 76.
---
I have two other people who play the game on my console and that 50 pics limit is ***shared*** between us **all**
---
No it’s a photo frame
---
Dude that thing looks fantastic!
---
Why can’t you do that? Is there no way to “respec” at some point?
---
Nope. Even on low health build, you dont need a freakibg thousand stimpaks. Plan better next time. 
---
Watoga it’s the best go kill one and server hop I’m
---
Trying this once I empty all my aid 
---
I believe it’s the gun smith perks 
---
If you can spawn in
---
Forcing people to create new characters nwiuld be pointless. Within a month brand new level 2 characters leaving the vault would never go anywhere from the high levels killing them. You need to be able to build up before going into survival.p
---
&gt;Map Reveals - I'm not entirely against this, but it's a form of punishment being revealed on the map not a brag. 
---
This is to force you to actually face risk.
---
If you play the game cautiously, you can pretty much never die.  Don't hang around places like Whitesprings where lots of other people are, play a sneak build, and use the NPCs as warnings that there are other players about.
---
&gt;Bounties Costing Twice the Amount they're Worth - This one's pretty simple, what you put on somebody's head is what people should get for killing them. What's happening to the other half? 
---
It's a money sink.
---
There's a bunch of money flowing into the game via vendors, and not a whole lot of ways money leaves the game.  That's not good in the very near term, because MUDflation is not a good thing.  So the game needs sinks of some sort to take money out of the game.
---
&gt;Edit: Oh and remove the killfeed, why the Hell is there a killfeed?!? 
---
So that you feel a sense of danger.
---
Outplayed.
---
Everyone wanted an online es/fallout game, when get em both and people flock the generic run of the mill mmo poop that is eso.
---
I’ll never understand the opinion of the masses, all the top games are typically rehashed garbage or haven’t left the leader boards in years. There has to be some sort of group think that goes into this stuff
---
The other player is wasting caps already though.  Doesn’t it cost the player 2:1 ratio for applying a bounty?
---
No idea but for the récord i got killed 3 times and I was only level 15 once I hit the time survived leaderboard I got stalked and killed always 
---
And if there is more than one account on the ps4 who plays f76 it is *shared* between them.
---
I don't think I've ever seen anyone say anything about it. 
---
What about the people who want to make a new character in survival.  How does one prepare for that?  By... not making a new character?  Shouldn't this at least be a reasonable option for those who want that experience?  If it was made for fully geared players only, then why exactly is a new character ever given as a choice?  And what's your argument against keeping lower level players in a separate server from fully geared ones?  Because then you wouldn't have anyone to overpower?  
---
I can and my camp is at whitespring station 
---
This happened to me today. I lost dozens of stimpacks, RadAway, etc and 240 caps. Not worth it. Last time I touch survival.
---
That said I see the appeal for other players. Just not my thing.
---
What system do u play on?
---
Actually that's pretty cool man. Sorry for being an ass 
---
It is all in beta still so they can roll back and make changes to it later which I hope they do...
---
batteries included just prevents me from being overencumbered and hold all my energy ammo..luck of the draw is good but its in luck not intelligence...i have just enough points in luck for starch gene class freak and good with salt. pvp would be fun if it didnt cost so much caps 
---
I saw a texture with snow 
---
Nope. No mods except the Prime reciever exist for the LMG (I mean, what did you expect? It *is* a MG-42 after all. Not much you can do with it)
---
We told em so,now they can bask in the tears.
---
Sounds like consensual PvP. Nothing to see here, move along.
---
LMAO
---
They’ll get rid of it soon, the invulnerability doesn’t even exist 
---
&gt; while newer players can level up and get gear.
---
That's called "Adventure mode".
---
Maybe they haven’t change their icon?
---
If you leave the survival server to go to Adventure to fast travel, what guarantees that you will go back to the same survival server you left?
---
Thx daddy ;)
---
I really dislike the leaderboards. It becomes like a hunt for the #1. At most just show the bounties people get, and if somone goes on a killing spree have like an hour to get hella caps and do from that person.
---
I don't dupe or cheat, but my bloody build one-shots a lot, so I guess I'm in your list of scorn? 🙄
---
I chose this build *because* of the challenge. If I get hit in PvE, I usually die. I have to play much more carefully.
---
But yet....people still making new characters and then bitching lol
---
Think it’s gunsmith, it has 5 lvls so not sure how far you would need to upgrade it. That said you can craft the handmade from lvl 15 so I wouldn’t imagine it needs many rank ups to be able to craft it. 
---
Hey, what system are you on? 
---
Honestly I thought it was a random reward for a public event or something! Its realativley cheap too at the medical bay modus 
---
What level are you? 
---
This is an absolutely phenomenal C.A.M.P. btw
---
It tells you what perk you need when you view it at the weapon bench.  
---
Think so? It was all colorful on map a while ago. I haven't seen any non default icons recently like for days.
---
Coud just have it to where armor is set to 50 50 50 for anyone in active pvp
---
I did it the genuine way when I heard you could carry over accounts.  Hit level 60 the other day, not TSE, no bloodied build, no exploits. Just playing casually.
---
thanks man
---
How's yours?
---
What's crazy is I think some top shelf douchebags are still in adventure. Went to turn in my technical data first thing today when I logged on and as I was walking out the door, some guy was standing in front of me with a Fatman in my face just harassing me. Sure no slap damage, but I think some people just like being rude in general.
---
Preach on brother. 
---
Workshops in PVE will be a total nightmare with broke and butthurt griefers, ahem, "Raiders" looking to PVP easy targets for caps and resources.  Expect stupid stuff too.. Like traps to lure you into car explosions, etc. since the new pacifist mode will negate their ability to do slap damage. I'm more interested how these PVP parasites will screw up PVE now they realize being one-shot killed and respawning over and over is not much fun in survival mode.
---
True that forgot about that one, yeah I really hope we get a vendor that maybe is a special vendor that sells the new alcohols.
---
Survival mode is broken. People camp on top of choke-points and train stations with TSE weapons. I was pumped for this mode for 12 hours and lost hype in 12 minutes.
---
I finally did it. 
---
So someone suggested this and it worked for me. 
---
I went to Watoga (where the robots are friendly to me) and stripped off all my perk cards, weapons and apparel. I drank the bourbon, snuck up to a protectron and punched it in the back and the mission finally completed. 
---
I agree the spawncamping is dumb (even though the delay is long enough to run a few meters away and shoot back), but... no. The fast travel strategy you mentioned isnt that useful, at least not for chasing down players, because on relog you aren't in the same server. If you do rejoin a friend, it isn't really that big a deal because the fight with the other person will still be the same, regardless of how long it took you to get there. I just dont see it happening often enough or being a big enough deal to be a serious problem. On the other side, allowing fast travel anywhere would be extremely chaotic for fair pvp, as the whole server would be fast travelling directly on the top 3 people on the leaderboard.
---
Yes because I believe that snap impressions often lead to shitty suggestions/impressions I must be spamming stealth boys. 
---
The internet is fucking brilliant.
---
It’s all just a simulation, that’s why none of the clocks work and dates never change.
---
As they repeatedly mentioned in the game..
---
Nothing is real.
---
Saved, you beautiful farmer.
---
Time to do AWOL more often then 
---
Yes. They will absolutely abandon the game, and not just return to the mode where all the improvements have been made, the mode they likely picked up the game in the first place.
---
I swear to God. 
---
U mean u can blueprint what u have built in your workshop and place it again? 
---
Dont let people camp vault 76
---
no discounts if you already have some skins tho
---
I took a picture with an invisible head wearing cowboy hat shades and a bandana
---
Stealth commando
---
if you join off of a friend it is guaranteed to rejoin off of a friend. otherwise not exactly a chance 
---
Nobody cared about the griefers burning camps and farming caps before, picking on low levels and their workshops... you attacked back, it was consensual. Get good. Oh just server hop away from the bullies. Just ignore them, its only slap damage. Don't engage them... 
---
Welcome to the Thunderdome!
---
Oh my bad. I just found a person with a nuka girl. Sorry for this stupid post I made.
---
Did you select survivor mode when you joined the server? It's clearly stated, full on PvP. Obviously any game mechanics are intentional and not a cheap exploit.
---
I wish we could get our perk card choices given back for these useless perks broken by patches or nerfing, like cap collector doesn't even work anymore since cap stashes are containers now.
---
The thing is it runs through ammo fast as hell 
---
Nice!
---
all good :)
---
You’ve got some spot on suggestions. Hopefully these catch their attention. I’m all for no leader board, and much less map reveals.  u/ladydevann
---
Yes
---
So you have pacifist mode turned on?
---
If you don't have an answer for my question please keep your opinion for yourself.
---
Sounds like you'd be happiest if you just kept playing Division 2.
---
Hah, that's fantastic 
---
Yeah I like how they did so much work on camping for adventure mode, but this mode they were too short sighted to see camping. Like if your going make few fast travel points make the spawn locations random areas around that location so its impossible for a camper to just have their sights on the 1 spawn point at that location.
---
In your defense, it can spawn as random reward. I bought it, then a few weeks later got the recipe during Uranium Fever. I got the Super Stimpak recipe from one of many nuke launches. 
---
Agreed
---
Absolute pro tip!
---
Which game mode?
---
What did you need help on?
---
I don't believe so
---
What about the war cemetery up north, civil war fort. Sorry i cant remember its name, but theres a daily there.
---
Hunter/Hunted event is exactly this. Would make more sense this way in survival.
---
Max out all rifleman perks (total of 9 pts needed) and that’ll get you +60% damage only for semi auto rifles 
---
Or a 12 year old microwaving a hot pocket and doing the most obnoxious lip smacking eating of it I’ve ever heard after asking me to join him and help him do the excavator Armor quest. 
---
PS4
---
That’s what I have but I feel two shots might not be good anymore 
---
I’m sorry but there is much more pressing matters for the community managers or whatever to reply to.
---
Sorry. Xbox One here.
---
This is why they should have made it new characters only and the weekly legendary weapon make it craftable item you unlock for all your current characters, and the item isn't tradeable like an atom shop item so people can't make profit off it.
---
Survival, killing players, PS4 
---
thats the point, theres really no reason to put a bounty on someone because their friend can take it and split it.
---
Psn noscope_420bird lv 93 btw
---
Are you actually gaining xp?
---
Or is it just delayed xp, form a mob you killed sometime before?
---
This is the first camp I've seen that really looks fully finished and realistic. Great idea putting it against the damn. Job well done!
---
Also wont be on till tomorrow 
---
PvP drives up prices on PvP gear. PvE player loots a good PvP gear. PvE sells to PvP because they don't need. Economy saved.
---
I've been trying to figure out of its worth it to start a new character and your comment was helpful. I'll give it a go and just avoid the likley camp spots and see if I can survive by being a dirty sneak :P That'll be my motivation because I sure as hell won't be able to kill anybody for a while.
---
you can join through recent
---
My feedback (sorry for my english)
---
1) Remove top 3 from map too. It punish you for surviving, so it suck
---
2) Remove cap reward scaling after level 50. It punish you for leveling, so it suck.
---
3) Invulnerability window don't work, camping is a thing, you get one shot after window ends, and it ends even before loading finishes. Change stations to sanctuary zones, maybe?
---
Also, as a side note, general imbalance of builds just shines in new mode.
---
4) While aid items dropping seems fair, if all healing gone, you're out of game. Either exclude healing items, or keep minimum (and minimum like 20-50, let's be real). Or ammo for non-current weapon can be dropped instead.
---
Overall new mode don't feels like a "surviving" with additional danger from dwellers who can go hostile, it's more like a some kind of king-of-the-hill deathmatch, but for pure pvp mode it's too much rigged and imbalanced to be competitive.
---
pacifist mode is off and was never on 
---
&gt;Special weapons are locked behind loss 200 caps every time some loser chooses to fuck with you
---
What does this mean?
---
Hopefully this year, wonder if we will even get them what if they are going play the lets stall until everyone forgets card?
---
Imagine if we could do this outside of the game...
---
Yes, you need to have a good ammo farming routine to fuel it. Personally when I need to build my ammo reserves I switch to sniper to farm out the lead and steel, and back to commando when I've stocked back up.
---
True that.
---
you can join through recent players
---
😂
---
The camp is awesome lol. I’ve spent hours and hours slowly accumulating plans and making one hell of a hangout/trading post lol
---
To get tokens for it or outfit itself
---
Kids these days don’t remember the VCR flashing 12:00.
---
Where’s a good place to farm lead?
---
Thats kinda sad.
---
The experience boost, mostly. I actually *am* a new player, and I thought about seeing if I could sneak by in Survival just for that juicy extra 20%.
---
Plus, what do I have to lose at low level? 
---
or that same 12 year old singing along to juicewrld that’s blasting in the background
---
They should employ level matching, proper matchmaking algorithms, like every other multiplayer game in existence. You're a level 5? You should get put on a server with only people +\- 5 of your level. 
---
Since they obviously are pandering to the types of people who go into level 200+, and will cry that they can't test it in PVP (aka, the only people spending real money on the atom shop), then just let those people play with each other only. Bam, fair.
---
I want people to be forced to start over too, but it just doesn't make sense for holding onto players that will keep spending real world money on future content. They gotta make their money. 
---
Personally, i'm not PVP-ing until I'm either OP as Shiet, or they implement matchmaking. This "get who you get" crap is... well brahmin shit. 
---
Eh, all he did since you didn't have any caps or items was raise his standing in the ladder, and the top 3 players are seen by everyone on the map even when crouched. All he did was let people know there was an easy camper at the vault lol
---
How did u get the brotherhood stuff?
---
I  spotted (and immediately killed) a Legendary Insult Bot the other day. I deeply regret not waiting for him to roast me.
---
Here we go lol
---
They didn't on this, so I fully expect them not to afterwards. 
---
Pardon my noobness about biv(I’ve been farming the parade) but how are you notified about the daily?  Is it like the Camden park daily’s where you have to get in range of the park?
---
I don’t know I’m new too. I could see it being really not much fun if you get camped and lose all your aid 
---
I can't actually tell because the xp metre isn't very accurate. I hopped on there now and clicked play and when I loaded in I got 56 xp for no apparent reason.
---
Noticed my friend was online so I joined his server and it actually popped up 56 xp twice. Perhaps its just purely visual or it is delayed xp but I can't quite figure out whats happening.
---
Dam, yeah I would submit a ticket to Bethesda, maybe a patch will eventually fix it in couple months since it will be low priority for them since its giving away free atoms.
---
I made friends and hung out with 3 people, I just constantly did the heart emote, and wave, and was sure to put my weapon away!
---
&gt;reasonable prices 
---
Good joke. 
---
I know i made a 4 Survival Mode account and its tuff i thought others would do the same but nope level 200+ just camping vault 76 and killing me over and over agian
---
I've thought about this, too. What about the pipboy tho?
---
I chose to start a new character to avoid losing items. The fact that I was level 2 didn’t stop level 300+ player from using their explosive weapons on me. I was in Flatwoods and was killed by a high level player hiding next to the player spawn point. You literally won’t survive survival mode unless you have god-tier weapons and armour.
---
You realise survival is supposed to be HARDER right? Doing that would be counterproductive.
---

This is roughly what I see.  But it's more for stealthyness.
---
This games pvp will never be good, why are they even trying still lmao. Who ever asked for a fallout pvp game
---
I agree.  In fact, you just made me wonder if they are worried they haven't plugged all the holes and a fresh start would reveal that.
---
I fuckin called that from the get go with the spawnkill and level hunting shit thats why i didnt even try and get on today. People been waiting to test their armor out for weeks its gonna be a while before it dies down
---
It was knife of you to post this.  Shanks!
---
+?
---
Already thinking about a Vault Tec Security Cop with a drug problem who hunts down bounties in survival mode to get his fixes
---
Kill 20-25 legendary enemies 
---
Yes, I just had a different expectation....
---
I have beret.. not sure if I wanna sell as it’s my
---
Only one... offer?
---
The faggots who camp at the trains get me the hardest, these no life losers, Iv lost now 3000 caps I lose 4000 I’m uninstalling 
---
You are clearly missing the point. 
---
1000 caps?
---
So working for your guns is bad? He have this free gun and participation trophy 
---
Maybe some brave modder could help us? It's actually a qol thing, it wouldn't change game aspects
---
I personally would have liked to see a vendor that you could trade masks in for tokens. Then use those tokens to buy plans or eventually save up for a rare mask. I gave up on the rare masks and decided to go for all the plans. I got them all but it required a lot of server hopping to get. Given it's a limited time event and not everyone has time to grind 24/7 it would have been nice to have an alternative way to get the rewards. 
---
If you said adventure, then sure, but survivle... heh, yeah right. Git gud scrub.
---
what system u on?
---
and yes it does
---
For now I've just kept all the old changes I read about in my ini, even with updates adding an in-game DOF. I'm pretty happy with it. Right now I'm just wondering if there are any changes I can make for possibly more smooth (less fluctuating) performance essentially. Or just anything new that I may have missed to keep in mind.
---
Right now I know of disabling grass, but I quite like that. I was thinking of editing the shadow distance to a lower number, but I'm not too show how much impact it would be.
---
Oh I dont need a cap reward to give ya the old wastelander treatment.
---
XB1
---
So his motto is "just one more hit" !?
---
That looks amazing!  How did you get those angled walls?
---
There’s a difference between working to get your gun and getting raped while working 
---
Man I just server hopped 6 times and nothing   Supposed to Benin the shelving by the yellow crate and overturned brown crate right?
---
They said from the beginning that you could use existing characters
---
Requiring new characters would only delay this, not prevent it.
---
Start your new character in adventure mode, travel somewhere else, log out and load into survival. 
---
I have 80super stimpacks, and 100lbs free in stash. Also i am lvl 200 so i would lose 400caps per death?
---
Do you have any perk points accumulated? You need to use up any previous points until you're technically using the point from hitting level 21. 
---
Check your xp now, then join friends server. See if you have more?
---
I’ve tried drinking fermented beer and it doesn’t trigger anything else. My quest says “fresh beer”. No idea what to do
---
I think it's worse for people questing at Whitespring, the train station is a permanent PvP mode.
---
I can't complain though I'm having a blast, I've jumped back on my old heavy gun build and have been using my bunker buster and ultracite anti armour MG42 to melt kids.
---
I generally leave low levels alone but with the whole being red when you have your gun out I have had level 20-30s just open up on me in which I'll melt them if they are actually doing significant damage. 
---
Well done! kthxbai lol 
---
My only complaint is I keep fucking crashing. 
---
i will give you one(plan) join my game GT : Tanaas 
---
send xbox msg once you in my world
---
So you’re telling me every spot where a legendary mob spawns there someone waiting to kill you?  Don’t go to white springs get creative adapt of die my guy 
---
I agree with you.  I feel like this new mode isn’t that though.  It is just battle royale.  If they got rid of the showing who has survived the longest nonsense and players showing up on the map it could be that.
---
Basically just take away the whole slap damage thing and make it a mystery as far as where people are.  Then it really does raise the tension.
---
“For the love of Paladin Danse”
---
This quote made today amazing.
---
Wow. Sweet!  Thank you!   Headed you way 
---
My experience of survival mode so far... Level 51.
---
Spawn in, start an event (because why not?).
---
Play for 50-something minutes.
---
Go to one of needed event locations.
---
Hey is that a level-300???? Bloody-*BANG-back-of-head-explodes-with-one-shot*.
---
Fair enough.
---
Respawn at CAMP.
---
Log out, log in to Adventure.
---
If you dont turn of pacifist mode in adventure, you may have problems in survival cause it works there too. Cool people downvoting what they dont understand to.
---
yup
---
White springs, hawke refuge, RR watoga all being camped, every time 
---
That bunker we was using to kill scorchbeast queen everytime. Also there are more than one in cranbery bog.
---
Always 
---
The only way to respec is after level 50 you can choose to reallocate a special stat instead of getting a perk. It's super slow but technically possible.
---
That looks so cozy. 
---
This kind of post won't see this logic lol every time this point is brought up, they ignore it. 
---
I'm guessing you are in the wrong thread?
---
Oh damn. I better look at builds then or I’m gonna be gimped. I’m only at level 6 though so it’s not too late 
---
God damn that's hot. I personally build my base up by Aaronholt Homestead
---
I absolutely love that you included the Scorchbeast queen in this list. Perfect.
---
Also, saved this post. Thanks for the info and references!
---
I’m not talking about the people currently playing. They’re going to most likely continue playing regardless. 
---
I’m talking about the thousands and thousands of players who were excited to play a Fallout PvP game who quit while waiting for this to be released, only for it to be as janky as ever. 
---
*I swear to God.*
---
It resolved lol. Yeah I checked my status first thing 
---
you can every 5lv take1 point and put it into another special, but being lv130 takes ages to lv up. From the scratch you lv super fast, dunno i think it's better
---
Would get raped again... jeez
---
Well... I was... disconnected from server. Trying again
---
It's a mode that is almost literally the same thing as what we have already. We want new content. Nobody asked for this mode, just pvp in normal mode.
---
Yay!
---
So ppl are not stashing items? Really?
---
Does the other person have pacifist mode on? That happened to me the other day. Trying to help someone who had a bounty. Was three swings in with no damage before I realized I had pacifist on.   
---
Currently "World spawned" booze works for Biv's repeatables.
---
You just need to get a Pickaxe Pilsner from wherever and give it to him and you are done.
---
I think there's a difference between having to put in time and having to win the lottery. I vastly prefer the former to the latter if I'm being asked to spend a bunch of my free time on a game. 
---
I don't even know if it's role-play at this point.
---
send me msg ( on xbox)once you get in 
---
Just because someone is complaining about how survival currently works doesn’t mean that they disagreed with you or were shitting on you.
---
👍
---
So I can wear the spacesuit and jump in low gravity 🚀
---
what is your gt?
---
dunno, different receivers (scorch killer at least) maybe extended magazine capacity. at least something to mod it with.
---
Krazylikeafox 
---
If you're wanted and don't want to be just take off your armor and stand around at Whitesprings, someone will be along shortly to relieve you of your bounty.
---
Yes I agree, I should have stashed. But I seriously think it’s super unreasonable to have lost that many healing items per death. I think 1-5 is more than reasonable per item. 1-5 stims would have made more sense than 40 or whatever 
---
World is full.  
---
OP, that is exactly what I was hoping for.  The current survival mode is just battle royale.
---
Bout the same price as watching a digital moving picture
---
I'd rather look badass than go to the movies (or buy coffee at $5/cup, or smokes, or alcohol...)
---
They never said we had to make a new guy.....
---
No worries I can wait.  
---
A friend of mine took a look at my inventory said this the other day "anything one star or non-legendary ..sell"
---
I don't see HOW he could have been using VATS. VATS has a maximum range wherein you can actually target players, and he was one shotting people beyond that range. And you can't target a crouched person or Chameleon/stealth boy user. But he was nailing people well outside that range, without missing EVERY time. I just for the life of me can't figure out how you could do that without an aimbot of some kind. You could do it manually in theory, but you will miss most of your shots and in practice that is extremely hard to do. Every time is beyond all skill and coincidence, imo. The more I think about it the more I suspect he was aimbotting. Nothing else seems to fit, regardless of gear and skill.
---
As a level 127 who just did my first solo silo last week a word to the wise: it's a bit time consuming but no harder than West-Tek and shares more in common with the power plant repowering side quests than anything else. Also fuck ceiling lasers.
---
Well ..it's a lesson-learned..I'm always mad at myself when I lose my loot
---
I also don't see why they can't change it as it would be an evergreen experience as long as they required you to reroll. 
---
Berets are really 1000?
---
I tried it once a few months ago and ran out of ammo. 
---
It’s gone :( heard the mod is still for sale tho 
---
I really want it.
---
That would be a good idea.  I can't quite remember which game did it, but there was one I played some time ago where a red circle would pop up on the map basically detailing any area with a lot of PvP activity (so it'd be an indicator to steer clear or go check it out depending on your motives).   Might've been RIFT in its Conquest PvP mode and general world PvP or something.  
---
That is the point.  You just play the game, but tension is higher since you have no idea who is around the next corner and if they are friendly.
---
I’m fine with having the current mode for people that want to just go after each other non stop too.
---
I got some as a reward for another quest of his and have been holding on to it in case I need it for another of his.
---
Narcissistic much?
---
So you met Biv eh? He's new to the Wasteland and gives out daily quests so the high levels were probably going to see him, or using the vendor bot in Flatwoods.
---
I have no problem with survival mode but I’m sure Bethesda didn’t want people spawn killed whenever they are forced to fast travel to a train station.. fecking ridiculous if you ask me Bethesda is just digging there own grave at this point. 
---
Hold onto C.A.M.P plans for me and the dragon. I can trade you legendaries and caps for both. I can get on this weekend. I’ll private message you when I can trade.
---
Then don't go in survival mode with &lt;Lv5? Like how fucking hard is this? It takes like 10 mins to get level 5 from adventure mode.
---
You're making non issue an issue just to complain.
---
That is amazing!
---
I do see this as a testing ground, they might find and work out a lot of game issues dealing with this mode. Though I really don't feel like being a guinea pig personally, I'll be over here with popcorn for now.
---
I feel like this could have been a phase before people start banding together into factions to kill the solo raiders, but there isn't really enough persistent community with the small number of players per game server. So it really does favor the solo raider types more I think.
---
As fuck
---
Mutations?
---
That and/or the event rewards could be buffed up in general.  It's sad to see basically no one bothering to do events anymore.  
---
He wants scared me and I shot at him..good thing I missed
---
Endurance is your best friend. Photosynthetic and Sun Kissed make the loss of aids on death a minor issue. Endurance to some may seem lackluster, but you can’t go wrong with more health. Also, it open up the Good Doggy perk so dog food is three times as helpful. Even at low levels I find myself coming across a can a lot.
---
Thank you! Level 130 and still useful! How do you save a post lol
---
What about...
---
"Random guy who comes out of stealth and hits you 3 times (one being high multiplier VATS crit to the head) before you can determine their build to pull out your counter"?
---
First ones the hardest. Eventually you'll get them down to 25 minutes or less and then even faster. Hope it went well!
---
Nevermind got it lol
---
Healing Factor my be the best mutation in the game.
---
Has someone who used to play piano and still loves hearing a piano. Thank you so very much! I love them 
---
Nevermind got it!
---
See I was worried about that too so I spent an entire day dedicated to crafting a TON of ammo cuz I knew that a.) I was gonna be facing down a million high level robots and b.) Presuming a successful launch I'd have to turn around and do an SBQ fight and that eats ammo for breakfast by itself. I ended up crafting 5,000 5mm, 1,000 .308, 1,000 .45 and 1,000 plasma cartridges. Ended up using maybe 2,000 of the 5mm and a handful of the rest. YMMV.
---
What in the actual _________
---
I personally wouldnt group with anyone in this gamemode already joined a group to have people tp to me quit  and gun me down.. Saddly for them i hunted them down and got my stuff back plus more in these gamemode its better solo raiding
---
Neat
---
This is pretty frustrating for an event that only lasted 1 week. If you use EXTREMELY low ball estimates, 3 different platforms with 100 servers each, running the event 40 times a day, with 5 players in each event for 7 days, that gives you 420,000 runs. We know of MAYBE 2 people overall 3 platforms that MIGHT have gotten one from the event. I ran the event at least 40 or 50 times and never had less than 5 people in my events, usually closer to 10. I also know for a fact that the event runs more often than 2 times an hour so my low ball numbers are probably laughably low. However, even if my numbers were completely accurate how many people would think it was worth doing this event if out 420,000 attempts 2 people got rare masks? That means they had 3 masks that never even dropped.
---
Suppose you are a level 20. A level 50 scorch beast starts attacking you. What do you do? RUN! Do the same in PvP. Not likely a level 100+ will chase you down for 40 caps and your meager supplies. If he does, turn some corners, find a hiding spot, fast travel to your camp. PvE doesn't hold your hand against high levels, PvP shouldn't either.
---
Biscuit lmao
---
Alright, I'm sold. Gimme space boots! 😀
---
At least in theory...
---
Yeah, greatest-generation-green. 
---
The shotgun skin is not working for me. It doesn't give me the option to paint any of my pump shotguns even though it clearly says that it is in the bundle.
---
The Morgantown Airport one is in the back NW area up the hill a little.
---
I have experienced both behaviours before patch 7 alas it seems - subjectively, as it turns out I have not recorded any hard data - to be much more common now, especially with the food buffs.
---
It is pretty much a given that I will lose the buff upon changing worlds or logging out.
---
Yea we’ll a lot of higher levels have snipers that can one shot or guns that can kill before you know there nearby
---
Well fuck. Sentinels armor users can now withstand everything congratulations bethesda you’ve allowed people to become gods. 
---
Everyone interested in PvP likes the idea of survival lol, not sure where you’re coming from
---
I like the compromise of allowing everyone to create a level 1 Survival Locked character that only gets put on servers with other Survival Locked characters.
---
Let the Level 287 carebears with full Duped Sentinel armor hack each other to pieces on their own playground. Let those who want an authentic survival experience to have that as well. 
---
I have yet to run into him. But the prizebot stalks me. 
---
Top kek!
---
That will happen no matter your level.
---
OIC, you were just tossing out a red herring. 
---
There no one shots, but a two shot is still very likely. Personally I have survived 4 total, but I just believe that was due to a wonky build. As for weaponry, 2H and Unarmed are still the best option.
---
not my taste but it's a good bundle for the price
---
I created a new toon, watched as people swarmed flatwoods looking for my level 3 (1hr life) kill people in sentinels crouching, stealthboys. there mustve been like 4 new people there level 3 or level 5 and atleast 6 higher levels all stealth sniper sentinel builds. My games bugged atm and I cant aim down sights or use vats for some reason I mocked people and then they all killed me and that was that.
---
Crits for sentinels? These still work?
---
I basically live at West Tek and it's certainly not a 10\10 ratio for getting legendaries. It's a high chance, but not definitely not a 100%.
---
My testing shows that it’s actually just sentinel armor and a 3 shot game for anyone not running it.  
---
Pipe rifles are as effective as bloodied weapons.
---
Well I don't mean "ruined" by "worth looting", I mean literal value, like tech :P 
---
I can imagine they'd get ruined right quick through the general course of finding out the Vault's "mission", then the usual rioting out of being pissed off lol
---
Beyond that, I'll pass on any spoilers and just be patient for their release (as curious as I may in fact be), but thank you! ;)
---
Good luck! You got this!
---
They don’t exist , if they do I’ll pay 10 k caps 
---
What I think needs to happen is get rid of trading so you cant just buy  your gear, force 6 month long seasons of new characters and leader boards and only show top 1 longest life
---
Private servers, I’m sure you’ll get it eventually.
---
Woah! You're well on your way to some sweet Nukashine!
---
But sometimes it takes a while to find them and watoga is pretty big
---
cool
---
Ooh yeah, Everything! My friend picked up a serum from a bag. 
---
Where?
---
Looks awesome.  Budget well balanced. Just on how big it is, I would have thought the inside would have a lot of empty space, but you really made the interior look used and interesting. Love camps the utilize unique locations.
---
There should be level limits per server, like levels 1-25 on this server, 100+ servers, etc. One question though, is damage still scaled to be ‘equal’ and ‘balanced’ like it was before?
---
You mean Crits on sentinels? If so, I’m not sure as I just stagger and kill them no problem. Gonna have to wait for some actual testing as mine is inconsistent at times.
---
Not with brackets a level 25 can’t one shot anouther 25 and the gunfight might actually be interesting because there could be strategy and a fair fight rather then just run away or get 1 shot snipe because the maxed out level has nothing better to do it makes it a game everyone can hop into. For example it wouldn’t be like this but people enjoy halo because in most game modes it’s a fair start and casual players and pros can match up without the pro getting an instant kill. A good example of a pvp in a pve mode allowing casuals to enjoy themselves is the division series because of its bracket system
---
Thanks dude, I appreciate the info a lot
---
I went to West Tek at least 10 times and in my experience there was at least one legendary there every time. RobCo usually isn’t that good yes, I just got lucky most likely, but Defiance every time I go there I find at least one legendary ghoul.
---
Solid advice, I'm planning on starting a new character in survival tonight
---
The witch is a common. Are you sure that's the one you need?
---
Are u on now
---
Some of us don’t always catch the patch notes, I’m not gonna break out the old “I have a life” gem so I’ll just say I must have been a bit busy with other things and didn’t see them. I saw I’d lose “some” aid items, I did *not* assume that meant in 2 deaths I’d lose 55 stimpacks and god knows what else, my carry weight went from 175 to 99...
---
No help cleared reserve and cache and get disconnected almost every time I fast travel since update this morning as well as not being able to login on any world after disconnect only tried in adventure mode anyone else having this issue or suggestions?
---
The first versions is notch 
---
No problem. It’s all I could muster at the time, but I can tell you TSE is not a one shot.
---
Generally the Whitesprings station vendor has all of them, but they're a little expensive.
---
Where on the map is that?
---
The invulnerability buff isn't working at the moment. 
---
But the fact that their friend could take it and split it doesn’t make it any more of a waste to the player putting the bounty out there in the first place.  They are already spending 2x the caps. 
---
Nice
---
Super informative for both newbies and experts.
---
Thank you for you insights, you are truly appreciated.
---
No, I get the point.  You want a game without much risk, but want the extra rewards.
---
I really wish you could snap foundations to floors 
---
For the daily 
---
Holy...
---
The one picture I seent looked like the Combat Shotgun.
---
Perception does help detect sneaking players, on the compass, and agility does help you stay sneaking and other players not spot you on their compass due to your agility.
---
I was doing about 400 Avg a punch, with 125% armor negation, would a crit one shot someone?
---
80 % next to Phoenix one will spawn 
---
It's been pretty rewarding for me... 100+ kills and 2 deaths so far.I started at 2k caps and am pretty close to cap max. I had to mule a bunch of aid and junk to 3 other characters.  
---
The truth is, if you don't have the gear you're gonna get destroyed. Also, inventory management is a must. I'm having fun, but reality is it is very unbalanced currently.
---
What time will you be on I think I'll be on till may be 7 or 8
---
Ya.  Pretty sure everyone forgets where wanted bounty caps come from.  They come from the wanted player. 
---
It’s a wild experience. Just don’t get mad and give up like a lot of this sub has
---
Heavy leather is the strongest when you combined points for DR and ER. It has slightly lower DR than metal but double ER. 
---
Combat/marine are weaker but give you RR, which isnt that consequential due to most situations needing RR will require powrr armor or hazmat anyway. 
---
See, I thought about saying how that could be a possibility, but I didn't want to give people ideas! Now I feel like I've been scammed... hahaha
---
Sure sure, as soon as explosive legendaries are nerfed again. Getting 1 shorted through 45% fireproof and PA is not acceptable.
---
Thanks for the PSA.  This is the exact kind of post we need as the game keeps getting it's locations gimped (and I'm assumed buffed elsewhere). Adding some of the ones I ignored now that I know legendaries are pretty much guaranteed.
---
Platform?
---
There’s a volleyball net there with a score lol
---
Armor pen caps at about 90%, but that all depends on who you are fighting. With little armor, without a doubt, but a stacked melee build, probably not.
---
I assume damage reduction perks still work if Sentinel does? Blocker, Dodgy, Lone Wanderer etc.
---
ps4
---
Me too. 
---
Hey that's a good idea. Also add some sort of slot system, like lots at a flea market that would allow you a limited build space to make buildings with other players in a sense. Lots next to one another that are separate but close and make it so weapons are holstered within a certain distance. You could have a little player made town.
---
It’s in beta so it can change. The characters need to be separate. But the biggest start is to remove legendary weapons and armor. Those stupid TSE, Bloodied, Sentinel builds are basically the meta. It’s the main reason why I don’t engage too much unless in a group. Removing them will make it more skill based with builds. 
---
I got witch
---
I'd actually like it if locations were hidden for everyone the entire time.  I like the idea of less restrictions on PvP, but at the same time just because I don't mind being able to be killed or kill myself I don't always want to focus on that aspect of it.
---
It's kind of difficult to go questing or just scavenge for stuff if after an hour or two you are now targeted for being at the top of the leader board.
---
does it bother anyone else the order seems to be random?  I mean the SBQ is right in the middle!  what is this order!
---
otherwise good list, quite informative, thank you.
---
Same for me.  And it is the primary reason why I bought the bundle. 
---
Is it a Ganymede plush? He makes a good birb
---
There are definitely things that could have been WAY better about survival, but its not like theyre forcing you to play survival. If you dont want to play the mode then its literally as easy as not playing it.
---
Example 1 had no perks. Example 2 had blocker and dodgy on. It appears to have no effect, similar to Armor piercing effects(DR and ER is a myth now I guess) didn’t think it was worth mentioning, but thank you, will edit.
---
Anyone with half a brain could see the absolute disaster of letting people's super powered characters into it and look at that, it's a total disaster.
---
West Tek is fickle, sometimes she'll bless you with multiple 3* in a single run, sometimes she'll leave you out to dry 10 times in a row. As I said I live there, and have ran it at too many times to count. I have it down to an art. 
---
I have never once had a legendary at Defiance, but I only go there to farm ballistic fiber. I'll add it to my farming run though, hopefully the RNG will start being kind to me. I actually rarely see ghouls there, I usually get insects for some reason.
---
Excuse me, what do you mean "mistake"? Hasn't it been normal for them to a) release unfinished products and b) to eather not fix them or taking forver to do so (the ps4 version of my fo4 is unplayable to this day because of the "0kb" error that precents saving the game).. if this was a mistake then it was a calculated one and i'm not even mad at them for that as that much was to be expected. What i'm mad at is the state this game is in from a multiplayer perspective because it's lacking, a lot.
---
I mean is there a single content in the game that actually supports the idea of multiplayer? All the events can be soloed, it doesn't have anything similar to dungeons or raids ... there's in fact nothing that could be called a endgame. It's nothing but farming and far from a state where finishing what they've started and charged people money for would do anything for it. That's where theyr efforts are asked for and looking at the roadmap, it's definitly not gonna happen in the near future, if at all.
---
(I forgot to reply to this) about the X2 damage wouldn’t  I need a specific perk to do that like how melee builds have Ninja? If that’s the case then covert operative would work since I’m using ranged weapons. Wouldn’t two shot  blackpowder weapons work just the same? Thanks for the tips 
---
Rip I'm XB1
---
and yea you were looking in  right spot its just only ther elike one outta 15 times or so that i go there 
---
Stealthboys and cryo weapons counter VATS builds, also just having good game sense and your play style to ensure you don’t get jumped on like that if you fast travelling to stations dont be suprised if somone is camping there if you survive getting jumped pop a stealth boy or throw a cryo grenade depleting their ap.  Tho to be fair you strat should be doing you best not to put yourself in a place you are likely too get jumped. As any good build will kill you if they get the jump on you like an any other game. Agree that steath is very strong in this game mode probs needs some tweaking but there are counters you can also use berry mentats to ensure ppl dont get the jump on you or use pa helmets which have a similar effect
---
Interesting. Maybe they weren't intending Sentinel to work either but they forgot.
---
How long does one have to live to make it on the leader board?
---
I disagree slightly. I think a bubble area should appear around you, about the size of a nuke that only adjusts once you cross its threshold so nobody knows exactly where you are.
---
Since I learned that it has a guaranteed legendary, I’ll run it as much as possible with my troubleshooter weaponry.
---
Those Gutsy robots though... they’ll mess you up!
---
Thats exactly what i was thinking!
---
Perhaps, but it’s too late. Thank god I convinced sentinel man to help me run tests after he got 2000 caps off me.
---
You have to go to Biv to get the next daily.  Sometimes he's drunker than usual, so it can take a few tries.  
---
Not on that one. Just don't be dumb and accept requests from strangers. Adventure mode is for paling around to with strangers 
---
You will find a vendor at Camden Park.
---
At least people would have to earn what they get not just hop in with "dirty" characters and one-shotting everyone.
---
i'm a little disappointed, I would like to get the bundle but I had already gotten the camo for the hunting rifle and the combat armor a while back.  can't justify getting a bundle that i already have 2 paints for.  I feel like we'll see more bundles similar to this one in the future.  Fingers crossed
---
Did you even read the post? He talked about making pacifist mode always disabled when entering survival since it makes no sense. You are talking shit without even reading. Like for real you've got problems. Big yikes.
---
I love that song, thank you for your contribution. It always made me remember the bee bot, bzz bzz. Happy memories. 
---
I think what you saw was the rare random encounter [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jlqqWL6dM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jlqqWL6dM)    
---
That's not new though, but definitely cool looking. I ran into it last week while tromping through the mountains.
---
Lol, read the post body....
---
r/madlads
---
I mean I'm expecting some frustration. But the only way to get better is to play a better opponent. It's nice being a God sometimes but I enjoy the frantic survival too. Kinda like when you meet your fist couple scorchbeasts. Also makes me thin of the older Resident Evil games or Metro. Sometimes stealth and a "tactical retreat" are the best options.

Looks like a pump. From their article https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6wzJHNfuM1wa2mGyDq62yD/fallout-76-new-items-and-sales-in-the-atomic-shop
---
Day 1 player here. The track hasn't changed since the BETA. Country Roads was never used as the intro theme.
---
The only thing a vendor is going to do in survival mode is get robbed
---
Have you read the patch notes?
---
At the time I put the events down that I did the most often, but I can always reorder it later if you want.
---
Weight rooms. Charleston fire dept  the motel near flatwoods. The prison.
---
Agreed 
---
The internet loves hate.  It's a sneaky hate spiral.
---
Angry feels good in a visceral way.  And being angry with other people is the best way to be angry.
---
I havent trusted the Internet's opinion since 1998.
---
I'm super glad you are enjoying it.  Seeing all the people here going "wow, it's actually fun" makes me sad.  If Zenimax had listened to the Internet Rage Mob, all these people discovering the fun factor never would have had a chance.
---
Not blaming you, just thinking out loud.  How many good things have been destroyed because a vocal minority killed it before it had a chance to show off?
---
YASS!!!! I've been thinking this for some time.  Just being able to drop a small camp to offload excess junk would be flipping wonderful. 
---
10 heavy machine guns in a row CHEWS through players not running sentinel assassin. 
---
Line it up at a spawn point and you have a very good spawn trap that gives you just enough time to get a shot in.
---
That would be even better, great idea! 
---
You want to encourage pvp gently, and give folks the ability to steer clear of a hot area. And getting on the leaderboard is something you want to do, not something you want to avoid by giving away your position. "forced" eventual dying isn't fun for anyone. 
---
Played an hour on my level 30 today without dying. My god tier weapons were the Perfect storm and an unmodded non legendary super sledge. The secret to my success is because I am low level and not op I didn't go to the popular points on the map. Even got 2 legendaries from doing Horde events.
---
most likely it is
---
Props. By my most generous estimate, I'm still not above about 30.
---
They will include something similar in a future patch \[no ETA for that tho\].
---
Gg
---
I quit after 7 🤣
---
It would have to be temporary and be recalled like your PA after so much time, or when you leave a server. 
---
Don’t bother going down the left side for exp or legendaries because yeah it usually is either bloatflys or molerats. The right side always has ghouls for me with the legendaries usually being on the first and second floors.
---
Jokes on you.  I don't even have a pee pee.
---
As long as you don't make the shadow distance too low it'll work very very well. Too low and things outside the range kinda flicker
---
You sonovabitch how’d you do it? Did you have to suck off Todd Howard or lay Pete Hines for those?
---
I only have a stealth/bloodied/crit build and I tried it on survival for a short while. I have all the perk cards maxed, low health, and perforated magazine on a bloodied explosive hunting rifle and every sneak critical head shot I landed, it knocked about 2/3 of their health down. They usually stimpak before I could land a second shot. Power armor or not, it seemed to be the same. I dont know if any of them had assassins sentinel though. I used to bounty hunt and be able to one shot pretty much anyone with this build. So my conclusion is that one shotting anyone with full health in survival isn't likely.
---
That'd be rad, there could be a daily where you find him sheet music. &lt;3
---
Or just nerf all armor and attack bonuses with respect to other players. You can keep PVE advantages but you can’t steam roll other players who aren’t meticulously designed.
---
Resistance doesn’t matter anymore. It’s 3 hits with standard weapons mate. 
---
I wear hearing aids &amp; have a streaming gizmo for the TV just so I can keep the TV volume low but loud in my ears. I wasted a perk on the caps finder... I was standing right in front of a cap box &amp; heard nothing... My wife sitting next to me said "what's that annoying beep/swish noise?" ... I turned the volume all the way up on the TV &amp; finally heard it. I laughed, turned the volume down &amp; deselected the perk. I also can dimmly hear the beep of a silo code carrier but can't tell what direction it is coming from, thank God for my teammates. 
---
Yeah, I finally realized the reason that someone was firing their gun into the ground was that they had dropped some things for me. I guess they got the message across, but it was kind of awkward.
---
Gotcha. Thanks 
---
I did it for the plans. Unfortunately I had no luck with the masks. It would have been nice to see people getting them but hopefully the next event we'll get some better drop rates. 
---
I expected at least the latter. I never wanted to play with people who already have BIS, I just wanted to play other fresh survival characters. Hopefully they add this, because this is extremely not fun as a new character. Just get steam rolled. I never asked for swapping modes, and was under the assumption we would be making fresh characters. 
---
Pretty much ruined the whole mode for me. I normally play survival games, and put tons of hours into DayZ mod, and standalone, and a ton of others. This takes the cake for worst survival experience. In DayZ, a crappy weapon and a dream can work. At least had a fair chance against gear people.This is just like lol you dead on sight. 
---
This is basically a high level mode to pure PvP and that’s okay, if you already have the gear, and build for it. Most of us were not planning on this, and we’re plan on fresh characters. There really needs to be some sort of level sorting. I understand they probably don’t want to fracture the player base, but this will get old fast if this how it’s going to be. I will just stick to adventure, and just worry about my business, and player vending machines. Which sucks I was excited for my two different mod characters. 
---
I login on pc aswell and it asks for my username, not my email. To enter the email I would need to bypass the launcher and load the exe directly, then login.
---
I see what you’re saying but at the same time in a couple weeks here people would have gear in survival and be doing exactly the same thing even if they were required to make new characters. It really doesn’t make a difference. 
---
no they spawn on top of west tek
---
Haters gonna say you server hopped 100 times at the top of West-Tek
---
Cut it out, these are horrible
---
Always wondered why it let you name a character if no one could see the name. 
---
Did you know those lamps only run for 20 minutes before shutting off?
---
I kept respawning at an event I didn't even get an option to fast travel out of to my camp :) what goes on in that studio is beyond me
---
I was killed within 2min. 🙃
---
Love this event.  Did it twice today, actually got a 3\* instigating combat rifle first go.  Second go I got an extra 3\* in wave 2 and it promptly blew up, blew up the truck next to it, and vanished.  I spent 15 minutes looking for it.  And the final 3\* gave me 1\* wood chest piece....
---
Sounds dumb
---
Couldn’t agree more, once they bring it to Steam they should kick it off with a free weekend right off the bat. I know so many people who are curious to try it out but still don’t want to pay for it and are still spooked by all the controversies before and after launch.
---
Average third place guaranteed seems to be around 45m but it can be longer. Survival rates seem to follow a weak form of zipf’s law where the exponent is between 1 and 2. So you might have a 1st that’s at 4 hours, 2nd at 2, and 3rd at 45m-1h. 
---
Great job man?  System?
---
You forgot  t h e m m   c l i p b o a r d s
---
You come off like the most especially stupid breed of asshole. Is that intentional or are you just having a bad night and not reading what you’re typing and the tone with which your message is coming across?
---
As long as mob spawns are based on players in area I want them on the map. Less for my own sake now but for lower level players.
---
I’m still relative low level (38) and don’t have a lot of caps. I would do more events, but it costs so much to travel to them I almost never find it worth it. I’d like to see Bethesda reduce or remove the fast travel cost on active events, along with having a “featured” event each week that grants better rewards. 
---
But even if they forced new characters most of you would be 20 levels in by the time I got to play. I am sure I am not the only one that doesn't get to play everyday. So does it really matter? It's not like everyone is going to play at the same time for the same amount of time.
---
Let's say they did force new characters. I MIGHT get to play Saturday. I login Saturday, I bet I would still run into people with PA already. Not really fair how you slice it. So it's not that big a deal. Unless you are one of the ones that can afford to play all day everyday, someone will always be higher level than you.
---
TL;DR If new characters were forced, some players will still be a lot higher level than others cuz life.
---
Dude it's like 20 bucks
---
I means someone nuked it earlier. Things will still spawn like it's a nuke zone for a decent while after the nuke itself is gone. 
---
Lol it took me 10 minutes to get the xo1 quantum paint today, it’s not that hard
---
Until you said that didn’t even know you could get one there 😂
---
Use vats lol. 
---
I am!
---
Better and rarer the mod is, harder will be the chance to unlock it, it took me like 50 handmade rifle to scrap to get the powerful automatic receiver and even more to get the special wood stock who looks like a stock from a VSS vintorez. Some plan seems only unlocked by purchasing it at vendor like fierce receiver for the assault rifle.
---
I know the feels, if your not supposed to be visible on the map, howd a band of ten guys know right where i was and even if killed they respawned on my death point, with 1 shot shotties. 
---
I'm PS4 as well, and yeah it seems to take a longer time to load in then what I've seen of PC and Xbox players. I haven't had a chance to try survival yet, but the invulnerability limit seemed pretty low to me when I read it. It can take me upwards of two full minutes to load in sometimes.
---
Doubtful. I can assure you there are currently thousands of tse handmades, shotguns, sentinel assassin's pieces... in adventure. What time would it take to have that amount in survival without duping? Maybe half a year at best. Specially considering that the popular legendary farming spots will be a bloodbath.
---
and I just switched to a melee build. GD it.
---
Being non-hostile to your group and others that are engaged in the same event as you is already a thing, with or without pacifist turned on. This is more likely an oversight on their part and will be patched. 
---
Yes! Not sure why you got downvoted though? But that was a fun quest line
---
I have had this for ages. It's not purely visual, either. The XP gain caused me to level up multiple times.
---
Times are tough atm. I have a code not being used. Someone might want it. 
---
Same, but in the future when we need a lot to like the current daily atom challenge kill ticks while using rip.
---
Ultracite PA reflectives plates
---
watch them run up to you and crumble
---
Gosh that sounds horrible. I wish the best of luck to you and your lack of caps lol
---
Huh, and to think I just give them to people.
---
New characters won't fix this problem, it will only delay it (and only once, unless you suggest periodic wipes). People don't need duped weapons to dunk on low-leveled players or even higher leveled casuals. All for the cost of forcing people (current and future) interested in both modes to use two separate characters.
---
Bethesda realized that they could make a map bigger and bigger with more and more quests but eventually players moved on. So, they the brilliant fuckers they are, created something completely new. This game is so dynamic and beautiful. Other people are what make this game great. If you hauled ass through the the story to get to the endgame you got what you always get, a now beaten "campaign" and a useless game. This game is different. You create a life and a purpose for yourself and can change that at the drop of the hat. 
---
You can sneak around the map now with a stealth build and shoot someone in the back. You can collect and sell for caps. You can join friends for events. You can meet friends at your camps and trade what you've found. You can scavenge for yourself or just to give other begginers loot they need to survive. You can be a saint. You can be a raider. You can be a trader. You can be a builder. You can be a casual. You can be a fanatic. 
---
Bethesda is brilliant. Nothing does it for me like this. It's just like good music or scotch. It's not easy the first time you experience it, because its...different. But once you give it a shot you could see what you're missing.
---
Survival should be: everyone starts from 0. Ammo weighs more and will always way more.  Increase proximity audio, can only carry two guns and a melee weapon.  I think they should have introduced the backpack in survival mode 
---
Hopefully they get there shit together haha 
---
I didn't intend to trade in survival. I just don't want my camp leveled just because someone can. It seems silly that you have to choose one or the other.
---
Exactly. What they need to do is find some way of limiting high levels from going after low levels. At least put a limit on any level below 50 if they are so many levels below you you can’t fight them. 50 and above are all fair game cause everyone has the same amount of special points and same amount of perk points they can use. 
---
Sounds like uhh...maybe legendaries shouldn't be in survival mode and you can only use base weapons, weapon mods and shit. Just a thought. 
---
Happened to me as well. 
---
I was having fun too, but then they just kept spawn killing me and a few others.
---
I think I’ll quit for now and go back once they fix Survival mode a little better. 
---
Survival? Welcome to it
---
What's criminal is 12hrs in and no one else upvoted you...
---
Perhaps they're just lacking context due to being too young? lol  
---

---
Gear isn’t as hard to get as you seem to think. Be it a couple weeks or half a year eventually people will have the gear and the exact same thing will be happening and the exact same complaints will be being made. If the mode is around for the long hall it doesn’t matter if they let old characters in. 
---
Also a vendor in Grafton
---
What platform? I just picked one up today 
---
PS4 🤞
---
Well, given the man's wearing Enclave clothing, and has a face not rotted away, I suspected a friend stood on the fence and Mistiqe killed them and that's how they fell. :P
---
But don't worry, I wondered the same thing initially till I worked it out. Other theory was an explosion happened to blow them up there, but that seemed waaay too unlikely!
---
No you didn't. Losing 1 robot doeant fail the event. 
---
Fast travel between train stations should be free.
---
Change my mind.
---
A suggestion that I think will help a lot of the people like you who are getting spawn camped and losing thousands of caps: spawn somewhere else. I lose sympathy after death #1.
---
One time some one throwed  3 orbital strikes
---
Didn't they fix the duping issue? I thought they did, because if it's still possible then new characters could dupe the first good weapon they come across and then that would make new character starts meaningless. 
---
I know they nerfed TSE and deleted things from people's inventory where they found hundreds of the same item but I thought they fixed the way to do it, too.
---
Gotta watch out for those clowns. 
---
He has not heard the true word...
---
except the part where you pay 1000 caps so you arent making anything back. 
---
I woke up next to a group of gnomes with a hatchet and a skeleton, and a teddy bear sitting in a chair watching them.
---
You sure that one Responder Eyebot wasn't around?
---
Vault 76 is NOT supposed to be the first to open. It opened 5 years after a bunch of other vaults had been opened already. 
---
And what’s the point really?
---
Yeah, there's always salt here on this sub during patch day, and some people come along and downvote anything that can be seen a positive statement about the game. No worries, glad you are enjoying yourself! If you're on PS4 and ever need help with anything just let me know.
---
Could’ve been unarmored people using the chameleon serum? I know I took my armor off since I don’t use stealth boys and brought the fight to them and won more times than not. 
---
Exactly what I thought would happen. A patch to make griefing and spawn killing even easier. *SLOW CLAP* Good job Bethesda.
---
This hasn't happened to me yet but I feel like it will.
---
Me too! What’s your psn? I’m on now for a bit and I’ll be on tomorrow as well
---
Yup. It’s all fucked. And it’s TSE one shots all day. 
---
Okay, no problem my guy
---
Trickay1stave I’m on as well. I can join up.
---
x2 damage is when you are not spotted by enemies and crouched. I think that's what you're asking? Covert Operative just increases the sneak damage to 2.5 I believe. Two shot weapons used to be +100% damage, but are now +25% because they were too powerful. Two shots also have more recoil spacing out the shots. 
---
If you're using a new character make a 4 by 4 camp with workbenches, a bed, stash, and turrets that you can plonk down anywhere. Really helpful to be able to store junk and aid for only like 10 caps.
---
* **Hallowed is the Mothman** * 
---
It’s one shot and you’re dead. Don’t believe what you’re seeing. This is bullshit. I want a real PvP experience. Not just level 255s with OP weapons. Peace out, Survival. 
---
Thanks for the heads up. Good to know that happens. I found a post mentioning that fShadowDistance
---
and fDirShadowDistance set at 20000 in the ini would be Fallout 4 on Ultra and 8000 was Skyrim on Ultra.
---
Not sure what kind of visuals it'll change in-game but maybe it'll be a good starting point. Do you know of a number that you think is rather unnoticeable visually, yet improves performance?
---
The one I’m stuck on is the Asylum one, which I assume is Fort Defiance, but I don’t know where the actual photo location/cemetery is. Beckley I just did but I can’t remember exactly, but it’s within the town.
---
It's a great deal.  I scooped it up right away, even though I already have the combat and hunting rifle skins.  The desert camo is perfect for the environment, especially Savage Divide.  It looks even more boss than the WV paint.
---
I didn't even notice that it came with camo suits.  I'm not in game now.  Which ones are they?
---
Yup. This shit is fucked. Beth don’t care. They’ve never addressed our concerns about this specifically. I just got one-shotted numerous times and got spawn killed like no other. Grace period, my ass.
---
They fixed duping, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. People are just looking for excuses on why they keep dying when they try to PvP.
---
I think it would be kind of cool if there were survival leagues/seasons. Everyone makes a new character for it, it goes for a couple months or something, the legendaries would just be available to the season, you’d have your leaderboard, and at the end of it you switch them all to adventure characters and do it all over again. 
---
Lol the problems with survival are not with keeping your character. Also in a month with a character reset you will still have an imbalance of players resulting in the only thing different being we can’t switch characters. If anything they should of had you make a new character for the first few weeks then allow all characters
---
juicewrld?   
---
So I usually start a party on console, even if playing alone, cuz it mutes everyone.  I see the little mic symbol when other players approach but I can't hear them. I did this because I heard a 12 year old trying to rap. It bothered me that he didn't know he was terrible. Since then Party all the time. On rare occassions I do leave the party to try and chat with some of you to see if there is interest in a trade, but I usually don't do this until I am about to log off.
---
Yeah. If you hide, you’re not going to get killed. Who’d have thought. 
---
The real problem is that legendary items balanced for PvE are hilariously unbalanced for PvP.
---
Devs should remove legendaries from Survival mode and make it so that the only legendaries you can use in it are the challenge rewards. This would actually give players a huge incentive to do them.
---
Yup. This shit is fucked. I want a real PvP experience. This is just TSE’s and spawn killing. It’s awful. 
---
Nice thing to note is, unlike Uranium Fever, a lot of the robots won’t be one shorted by some OP build if others are doing the event. They are pretty spongey.
---
Survival is fucking trash. It isn’t even PvP. It’s one shot OP weapons and spawn skills. This is fucked. Beth don’t give a fuck. 
---
Why though?  It makes more sense to me to not know at all like it would be IRL.  You know they are there by keeping your ears and eyes open.
---
I do think a mode sort of like the current survival has a place for people that want that too though.  More of the arcade death match type of vibe.
---
This is starting to sound like PUBG tactics. I wonder how many PVPers in Fo76 also play PUBG.
---
12 year old, get real...only pensioners play fo76.
---
It’s missing the shotgun skin ;/ 
---
I want the anti-material rifle to come back. When modded out it looks so goddamn cool. But it should already be in the game. Like most things in the Atom Shop.
---
Tysm! Are you sure you don’t want caps or anything?
---
I think it's fine to listen to others, but perhaps avoid the random youtube channel. Youtube streamers treat it like a business, because it is, and will mostly post things that the masses will agree to. Maybe get the opinion of people that like similar things as you?
---
Anyway, welcome home.
---
Why insist or starting a new character and not bring your main into survival???
---
I kinda want to make an alt just to see if I can hide in a cave or something lol. 
---
How does it work? Do the top 5 end up on the map, or do you have to naturally find people?
---
I’m saving all mine up for when player vending comes out to so people can buy them if they need them for the quests.
---
The dude has a point. You’ve got zero evidence that those people duped their stealthboys. With perks, just 1 single stealthboy can last 2 minutes. 
---
With regard to you having found so few in 700 hours of play, it definitely sounds like a “you” problem. I’ve got under 200 hours myself, have never intentionally gone out to farm them or bought them from other players/vendors, and have dozens.
---
I get it. It’s frustrating dying at all and even more so when you feel like you were unfairly slaughtered. This particular issue isn’t because of duping, though; it’s the overall balance of things that’s the problem. Regardless of whether or not a stealthboy was truly duped, these people will be able to run around invisibly murdering you until you ragequit. 
---
Instead of immediately jumping to the “they must be cheating” conclusion, try and think about whether or not what occurred is possible within the current rules of the game. It’s like folks allegedly getting one-shot with slap damage, which was proven to be impossible unless you had literally 5hp to begin with. Rather than think about how they could have possibly been flagged for pvp (usually ended up being either them or someone in their team claimed a workshop that got contested!), they wrongly jumped to the cheating conclusion.
---
tl;dr It’s not duping that’s the problem here. Stealthboys aren’t rare and can last 2min per. Think critically before crying foul. 
---
Yeah you can make some truly unique and interesting looking characters. There is just something about this game's art style. 
---
How about remove all legendary items from survival mode, except legendary rewards for doing the survival-only weekly challenges?
---
This would drastically reduce the power of players' ability to 1-shot each other, whilst simultaneously creating huge incentive for players to do the survival mode challenges.
---
Def, I’m at max caps right now anyway haha!! No worries at all. Enjoy :)
---
Only on steel, lead and aluminum I think.  
---
Still playing the game, but not rushing to where the campers have pitched their tents. People keep complaining that game is unplayable because spawn camp at whitespring, watoga, etc. I am trying to point out that it is a LARGE map. You can play Survival and not get constantly murdered. 
---
Is there any point in making a new character ?
---
I sell witch mask for 3K if you're interested
---
Did they’ve ever fix this?
---
Before the patch it was worth doing for selling purposes you could get better prices off of them say you wanted to sell steel 2 for 1 cap well you can only go as low as 1 per steel by when bulked there’s 30 steel you could sell them for 2:1
---
Most games like that allow characters to transfer from PvP servers to PvE servers but not the other way around.
---
Fighting in PvP against a player that farmed his gear in safe-and-easy PvE mode is just lame.
---
&gt;It's just a beta!
---
So was the actual game, and literally nothing was changed from beta to release, despite all the community outcry.
---
And now, despite people practically begging Bethesda to let it be a "fresh start" kind of deal, they gave us... this. Unless they completely purge the survival servers (and they almost certainly won't), the mode is forever tainted right from the start. 
---
I don't think they ever fixed this annoyance in FO4, but maybe we'll get lucky.
---
These puns make me run for the hilts.
---
Glad to hear it!
---
So after the patches bulking only affected it for selling not for weight? 
---
Congrats! 
---
Eyyyyy OP?!?  What level are you hommie?  I’m level 57, and if I relocate I’m retiring there 
---
Oh shit thats how they caught us! lol
---
I had mine built behind Grafton station and got a lot of foot traffic.
---
This, survival is fucked up, but not because of level diferences.
---
No that’s was the same before and after I think they changed the weights on some items but it’s not really anything to worry about.
---
it doesnt matter, there were gonna be high levels with crazy gear anyway.  Theres always gonna be some dude who plays 18 hours a day with nothing better to do than PvP.  
---
I think you can mute people through the social menu. I had to do it once because someone was blaring music while fighting the SBQ. I didn't mind what he was playing, it was just that the blood pouring out of my ears  needed to stop.
---
Yeah they should make the spawn points into non-combat zones. Of course then you’d have folks camping the edges of the zone but at least you’d have the opportunity to fast travel or server hop if necessary without being repeatedly murdered every time you respawn. 
---
Oh nooo, we neeeeed youuuu! Heheheheh jk but for real, In my brief experience today it wasn’t bad at all. There was pvp going on in the world but I didn’t experience any of it. I quested by myself but was always conscious that I might have to fight a raider. It was pretty fun, dogg ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
That's kind of it in a nutshell, isn't it. What we ***wanted*** was a deeply serious, intense, high-stakes game mode where smart planning, grit, and skill would win the day; what we ***got*** was an OP gear clown fiesta where no one wins and skill doesn't matter.
---
What a complete waste of design resources.

---
&gt;People are acting like this is a battle royale pvp only mode.
---
Only because Bethesda designed it poorly.
---
They need to listen to feedback and fix it.
---
I don’t know. Marsupial is really good. Tied for first imo. 
---
If they did someone would probably want 3 star weapons over caps or put something really high on it like 20k caps
---
I’ve got a camp a little above flatwoods and a little below the vault and get a lot of foot traffic from random people. I get a lot of visitors and a lot of servers also seem to have a camp there so I have to move servers. Seems like a popular area so you can try there.

I hope it gets better in the future. Cause right now, it’s basically a kill-o-thon.

And a crisper!
---
No. He’s a cockatiel. Adopted him when his owners left him outside for 3 months in the summer last year. 
---
Aluminum, Copper, Cork, Fertilizer, Gears, Lead, Oil, and Springs all weigh less bulked
---
Try taking over a workshop and getting someone to fight you.
---
Thanks ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
same dont have the shotty camo, but I have fun that my T60 have a skin called "Woodland Warrior camo"  the prob is that the warrior skin is only for the right leg 
---
Hey yo Dave I can hear your nose whistle through your mic again, wait what the feck is that.... oh shit. 😏
---
Good for you 👏👏👏
---
I think it’s an audio bug. Usually the volume fades with distance, but in this case that doesn’t seem to be working. 
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
also tones of meds, this is fuking crazy
---
Yes, because hiding is totally feasible when you have a high level player hunting you down just the fun of it. I didn’t have any caps or aid items. I guess since it’s the first day, everyone is just killing each other. 
---
It sounds good. Give everyone the true survival experience. Hell even add perma death. Make people take thing for granted. 
---
You should never eat a clown. They taste funny. 
---
So I don’t know for sure however when you fast travel to the fort you walk through the iron gate and then jump over the hedges to your right there are a bunch of graves. This could be the cemetery but I haven’t checked myself. 
---
Nah. Not this 
---
I have no idea what you just said, but I'm not going to try to decipher it either.
---
However, what I said is a fact. Anyone saying else, is just talking bullshit.
---
Since too many people don't like simple facts like these, well, there's nothing further to discuss. 
---
Be clueless and worried that if someone knows your email, IP and account names and ect, that some scary monster from the internet will come and do whatever scary monsters do. Ignore the fact that hunders or thounsands of people can see all these anyway.
---
Wish I would have.
---
I could have bought it for 1/3 the price, and not wasted a week trying to make launch fun.
---
Or just spent the money on Kingmaker :(
---
For Power armor it’s either X-01 or Ultracite.. depending on if you need focus on physical or energy damage resistance.
---
Really it all depends on the situation/mods etc. but this two are top level 
---
Or you can just carry nothing and drop nothing when you die lol
---
All intelligent people realize this eventually.  I haven't judged games by community response in a long time.
---
Top 3 are on the map as described in the patch notes, however I’m not sure if sneaking disables this visibility. I have two bounty collections that suggest crouching takes podium players off the map, or my targets we’re idiots despite setting up trap bounties with their friends and none of them checked the map. 
---
I think you can buy it at the whitesprings train station :) 
---
Drop landmimes and use vats. 
---
Also the cryolator is very good at hindering their jumping. 
---
Can I have some?
---
Ive seen them at watoga vendor
---
I like how a bunch of people think that the shit show survival is is because beth allowed people to bring over their characters. Like are you dumb, or stupid? ;p don’t need to explain why requiring to make a new character is dumb, plenty of people have expressed my point already and how in a month it would not fix survival and it would be the same shit show it is now.
---
It was a bug I didn't actually have that much :(
---
The bedrooms are really great.
---
Not to mention how ridiculously bright nighttime is now.
---
In my reading/replying I jumbled in my head your post and some of the others. Your situation sucked. Plain and simple.
---
Mode where you lose resources, you farmet months in adventure, in few minutes. I am glad i find out by another player diing. 
---
Don't try to track the entire jump. Aim during their ascent and pull the trigger when they're on their way down. Practice with a teammate so you don't have to worry about the frustration of dying/respawning while you work on mastering this.
---
For good measure, practice with a teammate who also has chameleon gear, and kill two birds with one stone. You'll get good at spotting stealthed players and gain practice coping with the next thing that's going to piss you off: *invisible* kangaroos.
---
Depends on your role:
---
* For Melee combat: +3 STR and +2 END from Shielded Enclave Operative Underarmor
---
* For Ranged combat: +3 AGI +3 PER +1 LCK from Shielded Raider Underarmor
---
* For crafting and merchant: +3 INT +3 CHA +1 LCK from Shielded Casual Underarmor
---
I'm not sure if Shielded Vault, Marine, or BoS is best in slot for any role. Comments welcome.
---
Depends on your build.
---
Wandering around the Mire and Cranberry Bog at any location while being lvl 50+ will net you a decent chance at legendary enemies.  Of course, you're going to find more where more enemies spawn, such as Watoga, Harper's Ferry and the unmarked farm near Abandoned Waste Dump (always two high level mobs duking it out with a last man standing rule)
---
Personally, I've had very good luck at the Thunder Mountain Substation just NW of Harper's Ferry and Big B's Rest Stop south of HF (my power armor/melee can't port directly into Harper's without losing all audio except team chat).  If you're at Big B's (Bigby a DnD reference?), make a short walk up the road to the west.  Under the train trestle is a random encounter point that can net you rare plans, items and more possible legendaries.
---
The other Thunder Mtn Substation north of Watoga also has a Deathclaw fighting a swarm of ants, and it's very likely that at least one ant is legendary.  The deathclaw makes quick work of the ants, so an explosive gun, tesla rifle, tesla coiled power armor or other AOE effect (even a simple molotov works) is recommended.  The deathclaw will ignore you until all the ants are dead, so I recommend helping the ants kill it, then taking them on.  I'd rather fight 3-4 injured ants than one injured deathclaw.
---
Of course, your mileage may vary.  I commonly farm Watoga and Whitesprings for legendaries, and some runs will have only one single star legendary, then a server hop might result in so many one star items that you become over-encumbered.  2-3 star enemies, which is where the really interesting stuff is at, are a totally random crapshoot.
---
At the risk of blowing up my honeyhole, **do not** underestimate horde events.  I've gotten all of my best gear from them.  Literally.  I got this [combat rifle](https://imgur.com/7cXTTsp) from a mirelurk near Fort Defiance a while back.  Today I got this [10mm SMG](https://imgur.com/nujmqBy) from a robobrain at Robco.
---
I wish I would have know that sooner. I’ve been bulking every single thing lol. I have almost 2 alts full with bulked junk. Guess I’m ready for player vendors...
---
I will trade or pay handsomely for the balloon recipe if you have a copy
---
Cool i got 200level there finaly. Also you look like gollum, but with hairs.
---
Those level 10’s need to go to adventure.
---
I think it’s a great idea, and would be awesome if you could hide in your basement at your camp, oh wait that’s right we don’t have those..... yet. 
---
iirc pc can’t
---
It ended this morning, pre-update.
---
Survival is generally suited for high level players that hop servers to find people who want to pvp. High level players want to use all that gear they saved up for. 
---
Add a zero and maybe, lol
---
This is what they do in diablo 3. And it works. 
---
Only problem is people are raging the thought of having to make a new character. But we are all going to do this anyways. So why is this current moment an issue?
---
What outfit is that?
---
The mode was designed for high level players that want to PvP , or masochistic low levels that want to give all their caps away. 
---
wooow so no way i can get a mask now ?
---
Only lead and aluminum. A bug in their bulks weights makes them weight about 50% less. All other bulks may add or remove a tiny bit of weight and are not worth wasting 2 plastic on unless you are going to immediately sell it to a vendor.
---
No. That's not a solution. Players should not be barred from a game mode just because they are low levels. The whole point of survival is to survive and have a harder experience. It's not survival when you're level 200 and have 10000 purified water and best loot.
---
If you need help dm me my group and I launch 2-3 a day
---
Now that we have a choice, Survival needs to be left alone to be a free for all. Players who want that, need a place to have it—otherwise they’ll keep finding ways around the limits in Adventure Mode. 
---
They’ve said that CAMPs will become non destructible by non hostiles in Adventure Mode, it’s just going to take a little more time. 
---
Subtle but cute, I love it!
---
2^32 = 4,294,967,296; max size for a 32-bit integer. 
---
So, I had a good time in survival mode. I went in with next to nothing as far as aid goes, cleared out my junk, etc. Played on my lvl 315 because my alt didn't have the points to respec into pvp spec right now. I played my standard heavy weapons / power armor build. I'd say the people I encountered were pretty evenly split between full assn/sent BE handmade players and power armor / non crazy geared players. Thanks to my  BE harpoon gun, I got a lot of kills. There were a few people that just stood there and took all the damage without losing any health though, and then killed me before I could switch to a gamma gun. Thankfully that was the exception, but considering that I probably ruined the nights of a few of the PvE players who will never come back to survival mode, I can't see this nice balance lasting. Within a few weeks it's going to be nothing but the elite pvpers. 
---
Overall, while it was fun for a few hours, it certainly was inefficient as hell to be constantly micro managing my inventory. In 3 hours I got as much done in survival as I would have gotten done in 30 minutes on adventure. I think for this reason, it's just not for me. 
---
TBH I can't see it holding the attention of the hardcore pvpers either. It's way too RNG / "who sees who first". It's always kind of like that in open world survival games, but I didn't mind it as much in games like REND or Atlas.
---
I have a duplicate of the witch on Xbox, I’m willing to trade for a ballon recipe if you have it
---
All I can visualize is the  moment in the hunger games when everyone is scrambling for looting or to get the hell out The cornucopia. 
---
How much?
---
The gear discrepancy is out of control.  Don't bother starting on a survival server..
---
And Vice Versa for high levels. High level players should not be punished just for having gear better than yours.
---
I have masks if your on ps4
---
Add me gofukyurslf326
---
Ok, keep your secrets and leave...
---
There were only four or five masks that were reasonably attainable, and most players have duplicates. You should be able to trade for them. 
---
I can give you one of each of you're on PS4. (PSN: femiwhat)
---
PlayStation right?
---
aw man im on xbox
---
How are you finding people to fight with? Heading over to hotspots or just following the top 3 players?
---
Max out demo expert 5 pts
---
I spent yesterday also building a bunker, I think its... 95% impenetrable 
---
Totally the state of the game. 
---
I have it maxed the thing is I have all the rifleman perks now I’m working on the commando perks 
---
you will also drop boobleheads, magazines, all alcohol and drugs. Every item in aid.
---
AWOL is one of the few events that I'll drop everything to do.
---
He had sentinel assassin armour. If you have the perk Concentrated Fire aim for the head in VATS.
---
There should be Xbox players out there with spare masks - people collected heaps.
---
See if you can get someone to give or trade some to you.
---
Gunzzz are too OP brooo they need to remove dem gunzzz and we fight with our fists ! Yeah, last man standing fist fight the queen ! YOLO
---
You can find it at whitesprings bunker 
---
Sent it
---
My camp in survival was a stash box with a turret on it lol. 
---
Also: Moving your camp or switching servers will rebuild it without using materials. 
---
I was thinking about a radius, but not for fast travel.  I figured after you get a certain distance away it would trigger an auto-recall timer like on power armor chassis.
---
I do like the idea of the mini-STASH too.  That way you could pack some stimpaks and food, like a camping cooler.  Maybe it could be limited to non-spoilable foods to help with the programming; keeping track of individual food items with different conditions in a separate inventory sounds tricky, limiting it to fixed condition items might help.
---
&gt;I’m about to hit level 5 and when I do, they all headshot me
---
Hitting level 5 doesn't matter in Survival. A level 2 player is fair game, as well.
---
Ye this is problem, because back in time, best method to get caps was to kill queen, you could do 7mins thru silo 3mins queen, so every 10mins 200caps. Thats 1200caps per hour with best group in game. Now you can make thousands per hour just by killing guys, what?
---
The thing is if you have the bandolier perk you basically just carry all of your ammo 
---
You could use the fireproof and or the dense chest mod. You could also use your camp to respawn. Or you could keep kamikaze face rolling from the same spawn point. I play solo so it was not me killing you but have seen your type all day.
---
Thanks. Good trick to know
---
1000 caps fair? 
---
I wish there was a min level req for survival that way people wouldn’t get confused as to whom this new game mode was intended for.  Don’t go to survival on a new character. It was made for end game players.  However I still am roaming around on a level 10 pestering all the high levels and laugh as they get zero caps only for me to respawn and slap them with my lvl 5 board all over again. Literally being a pest lmao 
---
That’s the reason I’m not hopping in it. I knew the moment they announced this that was coming the camping and unbalanced mess we have. 
---
I’ll gladly miss a reward that I can get in adventure mode. 
---
Remember that this Bethesda studio required weeks of bitching from the community before they added push-to-talk, a game option available in pretty much every online game for the last 10+ years at least.
---
&gt;  If true, that’s fucking weak. 
---
And thats 95% of the PvP community that I have ever experienced in this game summed up, only twice have I had people PvP me when they weren't wearing god tier armour and have god tier weapons
---
* Locked Survival-Only characters.
---
* 3-month league reset to maintain the health of starting/leveling character population.
---
Endgame is nice, but without massive amounts of new content, it won't encourage most players to come back and play the whole game: we'll just dip our toes in, finish the new stuff, then log out until the next content patch.
---
Continually resetting progression allows the field to remain relevant to a larger portion of the population. Most players will be WELL finished hitting 60+ in the first few weeks.
---
juice wrld is a crappy rapper that 12 year olds look up to like a god because he’s “edgy” 
---
Mate, then tell me how Indiana Jones is still alive then?
---
shame on you ......lol
---
Gonna try this tomorrow 
---
Clean Park Ranger outfit I believe 
---
I haven't see a plan there in weeks. Either is it over-farmed or plans no longer spawn there.
---
Oh goodness thank you I need it bad 
---
Well, just found out I have 100 RadAways. Probably won't need it for years.
---
Oh, for sure. Some sad people enjoy harassing and bullying others, and have no interest in fair fights like what they might find in Survival mode.
---
No legendaries on survival would be amazing. Sure you would have the one shots from dragon users but that’s a lot better than all the spawn camping TSE bullshit you see now in survival 
---
1. Lock me out of my time sunk character.
---
2. Remove my good loot.
---
3. Yes
---
4. Negate a major mechanic of the game and leave those who spent points into the perks in a bind.
---
What even are these suggestions? Hopefully it’s just you venting anger because yikes. Only worth while one is the third.
---
Good work! I have a question for you. Was this all the same map / session? I have a theory that the chance to get a legendary 2 or 3 star on any specific spawn stays consistent on each server.
---
alrighty
---
Wtf is this logic? This is like saying a lv10 should be able to SBQ then complain that she needs to be nerfed to accomnidate low levels.
---
Survival is for PVP. PLAYERS VS PLAYERS.
---
It's not another PVE mode. 
---
I have the camo bundle but the same thing happen to me, only have the Woodland Warrior skin for my T60 right leg
---
Not sure I haven't been on that bug character since.
---
I hope player vending shows on the map and is immune to destruction if you get trolls that are going to hunt peoples camps.
---
I spent all evening hunting players and what i found is i usually ended up hunting the players hunting the top players. Some people could 2 shot me across the map (yup still broken ass weapons out there) while my assassin level action full talents shot a guy 12 times in 16 seconds without powerarmor and the guy just laughed at me and blew me up.
---
Thats why we need fresh survival  toons. With a level playing field all this nonsense won't be so abusive.
---
I suggested something like this many a time. 
---
Two hubs: 
---
Social hub. Players can come hang out trade, whatever. 
---
Battle hub. Players meet split into team and duke it out TDM style. 
---
Everyday the hubs rotate around the map changing the   Battle scene and social hub. 
---
Giggity
---
Unfortunately, I’m not certain adding _more_ spawn points isn’t necessarily going to reduce the odds of us getting tagged by grievers, they’ll just scatter out in the end instead of grouping up at places like Vault 76. If anything they most likely will target those new spawns as they’ll draw more attention for players trying to respawn. Think of it like rolling the dice and you roll the unlucky number of the location you choose to spawn at assuming out of 22 other players on any given server at least 8 are huddling at individual locations. Next thing you know, that new location to spawn isn’t very safe because XxChickenGuy42xX is keeping an eye on said location for new traffic.
---
I’m not saying it’s a bad idea as it will limit the odds of another player running into each other, but it won’t address the main issue which is the grieving itself at spawn points.
---
The thing is though is that if they had fresh spawns and didnt allow any hoppping between survival and adventure, it would take longer to get ~"god tier" legendaries because you could just farm an area as all the farming spots people would know about and be killing you there constantly, you cant just nuke whitesprings and go through there repeatedly because you go there and within a few minutes someone else is there trying to kill you.  
---
If you somehow find somewhere to legendary farm not occupied by another player you'll survive too long and show up on the map then you have everyone coming after you
---
Thats like another thing. How many Caps do you lose upon death?
---
No love for the handmade gun?
---
Why is it a must? If it was new characters only it would be great to just work with what you have. Not sure how everyone being able to easily grab the best gear in the game makes it better.
---
He was talking about under armor not armor. Like vault suits, bos knight, soldier suit, etc.
---
I know he already answered you that he didn't kill, but the damage boost on low level characters is nuts. I have a lvl 15 sniper character that I made just to tool around a bit. he has a nice BoS Recon Sniper Rifle (basically a fully modded hardened hunting rifle) that does I think 68 or 70 damage. I was able to easily 2 shot a lvl 66 in full x-01 power armor, not once, but twice. It was honestly kind of BS how easily I killed him.
---
&gt;2 shot
---
&gt;Explosive
---
&gt;Level 20
---
Oh
---
Oops yes he clearly says that. 
---
Hey man, evil owl has no time for German lessons! (also Google lied to me) 
---
Don't be seen
---
Some of the events I did on the same server and Fort Defiance I cleared 2 or 3 times on the same server, but otherwise no. I focused on one location at a time and server hopped after I cleared it unless there was an event going on.
---
Prestige leveling is a couple months away, my dude.
---
Totally agree on the leaderboard part in this past day everytime I been on the leaderboard i die within 15mins to a guy using a stealthboy with a one shot build. 
---
It's even better with the Speed Demon mutation.  Reload in almost no time at all.  Of course, that also helps you burn through ammo...
---
Better yet, one randomized location in each region unique to each player which is reset each game session. Solves the whole incentive to camp out at the Train Stations.
---
Not an option man, the game marks you on the map for all to see when you're on the leaderboard. 
---
I'm not really going to be doing survival mode much, because it just isn't productive for me, but honestly... I transfered all of my caps off, stashed all of my aid except for 1 berry mentat, 3-4 of each stimpack, and 10 radaway, plus 10 food and water. I didn't really lose anything. I went in with only 100 caps, which I did lose eventually. I was up by 500 caps for a while, but then someone got me, and being level 315, I lost it all. Overall it was an OK diversion, but it's not something I'll be logging in to do often. Maybe not ever again. Just don't see the point.
---
Based on all the athletic vault tech items outside i am betting this was a test vault like the one we are supposed to build in fo4
---
No explosive weapon can two shot through power armor anymore
---
You can actually see invisibility distortion effect in the screen if you look hard enough. 
---
I think you can see them if they are on fire so maybe spam flamer or plasma flamer. 
---
Safe to assume that executioner’s effect still works as well?  If it only takes 3 shots to kill normally, the TtK would change?
---
This is the reason other survival pvp games die out, other players ruin it for newcomers, ever heard of ark?
---
Nah not under a rock. I saw the top 1 holed up in Biv's Speakeasy (and later the top 2 and 3 teamed together there after top 1 died). Pretty easily defended in my opinion.
---
Ah, Harper’s Ferry, that’s where I forgot to farm. I’ll farm that tomorrow and see what legendary drop rate I get and add it to this list.
---
Point 3 is beautiful. The rest.. nah.. 
---
Well it did, cut right through the T-51b like butter. If I had shadow play on I'd capture it.
---
Yes, lol I agree 
---
Berry mentats will allow you to spot them.
---
Grape Mentats
---
Been reported, on the long long list of things we are waiting to see fixed :)
---
gotta make em unkillable for this reason if they're merchants
---
Do you find that after you clear a specific location several times with hopping that you have less and less chance of finding a 2 or 3 star legendary enemy? It really seems that way for me, just wondering if it's coincidence or if anyone else has noticed it.
---
Yeah same. Still probably hit it 40+ times but I wouldn't have even came close to that if it wasn't for the beeswax haha
---
Blueprint just saves the location of items in the build. If correct you still need  the resources to build again. 
---
This is actually a pretty good idea. Most ideas on here have been absolute crap. But this is a great one! 
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Indeed I have. I'm just saying that it launched today if I recall correctly and people being able to use their 100+ lvl character from adventure mode is bullshit. 
---
I tried to preview what the camo bundle included but the pictures were just empty scenery...
---
I think it’s very random, but FWIW I also don’t think the magazine works. Camp move costs have literally been bugged since the beta. I tried to use the magazine when I was moving my camp around a lot to get the perfect radius and it was still charging me the same amount (more than the UI said it would cost). So I say don’t bother :(
---
They can see where you are on the map, but you can still go invisible ;)
---
THATS WHAT THAT NOISE WAS omg. 
---
Look under the stored tab.
---
How much are you selling/trading them for?
---
Raid on brother.
---
You're really annoying the “what I want is everyone want" subreddit children 
---
Haha yeah I couldn't believe it. We may not have gotten any rare masks but I think we still came out on top 
---
I’ll always upvote this. It’s so stupid that this isn’t already in the game.
---
 If they doing that they need to have a bracket system that goes by  level or a gear score not having a level 24 going up against 150's
---
Why do you assume off the bat that they didn't earn their gear? Is anyone who one-shots you "dirty"?
---
No. Go in hell. Thank you. 
---
The game was broken for me. I may try to get back into it after some time. 
---
Kidding, just to say... 
---
Yeah it does seem that way actually. The first time I farmed Defiance I found 2 2*s and a 3* after that I only found 1*s. It may have just been a coincidence, but I’d have to farm more to really find out.
---
Okay. Time to redesign my character.
---
Yeah the cost must be bugged. I had my camp at the dead south eastern corner of the map and again moved it to the northwest corner and it still cost me 40c. 
---
It's a high stakes hide and seek 
---
What’s the difference? In a month, when new people start and there are level 100+ characters in survival, where’s the fresh start for them?
---
I feel your pain. I only ended up getting one in like 40 tries but I kept coming back for the acid lol
---
&gt;get good
---
I fucking hate people that misuse this term. “Git gud” is supposed to mean honing your skills and improving so as to overcome the obstacle in front of you. Being a bitch boi in a gank squad and one-shotting noobies is as far from getting good as it gets. 
---
I had a similar experience with my new character (found a Berserker's Single Action Revolver which I got up to 58 damage). I went gung-ho with claiming bounties in Adventure at level 15 and was surprised that a VATS crit to the head would almost kill full health high level players.
---
Tell me more 
---
Why are you even walking around with 200!! aid items at once? You could never need that many stims, RadAways etc.
---
It‘s shitty that you‘ve lost all your items when it should only be a few but the blame here is on your side for not stashing them before going to survival mode where you know you could lose them.
---
What If you can't fast travel? 
---
Would be a nice addition
---
&gt; I like the compromise of allowing everyone to create a level 1 Survival Locked character that only gets put on servers with other Survival Locked characters.
---
That wouldn't prevent this issue, it would only delay it. What will be your complaint when a survival player gets to that level? Same shit, just delayed a few weeks.
---
All 5 for 1k, or 250c each
---
It worked for me. What usually happens if I place my camp then re-place it a few feet over is the second cost is at least 120-150 caps. I figured they don’t want players replacing inch by inch. 
---
So the magazine brings it down to 20-50 caps can replace. So realistically every time I camp I could see myself spending around 100 caps total. Which is reasonable. 
---
I too think it's expensive but then I remember all the other crap (digital or not) I bought and I barely used...
---
Stop thinking you have to decide for everyone. You're so annoying. These topics need to be moderated in one
---
It would be one thing if BGS was just letting the playerbase use their high rolled characters for the beta only. And changing it after, but we know they aren’t. 
---
I was trying to figure out a way to include my previous statement so I added a ps at the end
---
I’ve played other games where high and low level players can complete the same pve/pvp content. It just comes down to the devs’ ability to balance damage between levels. That’s really what this failure is highlighting.
---
You don’t have anything to lose. I say keep grinding because it’s so tedious to level grind in adventure mode. The 20% xp boost is so worth it.  
---
If they do this it needs to be one bank per account. Otherwise it’ll just lead to server instability and more hoarding and over saturated market. 
---
Hm, last time I was moving my camp around it was costing me tons of caps and then I remembered the magazine, read it, moved my camp again and it still cost me the same amount :(
---
Yeah. I was looking for a more interesting experience not walk 10 feet and get one shot by Mr.X-01NoLife (not a real user)
---
Aaah how many topics do you need to impose your thoughts to everyone! So annoying.
---
Recon scopes and the helmet mod for PA. Also poison effects will leave a green trail on them. 
---
my fights with other low levels have been close and great, as much as Ive enjoyed the mode so far today, it was a complete fuck up by letting existing stupidly op TSE bullshit into the new game mode right away and they just grief over and over and over because its an easy flow of 5-12 caps each kill on lowbies, and they drop like 40% of their aid items which is crazy.
---
I had such such such high hopes for this game mode and bethesda just took a dump on it by letting everyone play in it like it's a playground, I wish they would have not let any old characters join the new mode for like 2-3 weeks, to let the lowbies have fun while they could,  but nope.  Griefed since level 3.  I like how as the servers go up all the high levels rush to the first town so they can show off thier big dick killing.
---
Whatever, Ill still play it but its not as enjoyable.
---
Something like Claptraps secret stash from BL2 would be amazing. Maybe 50 pound limit for data reasons would suffice?
---
Ugh, LVL 37 and I’m 3000 caps short of the plans. This makes me jealous.
---
And I hate the complainers. 
---
Hell, I didn't even notice that when I posted this!  
---
I honestly can't believe this thread blew up the way it has.
---
What about every 10 minutes you get a satellite scan of where everyone is?
---
Haha, pretty much the same thing as today's release of survival beta
---
I still say. Fresh characters. No legendary items. No map markers. No quests. Just you versus the world. The legendary gear you get is added to you at the end of the season. 
---
If you can 1-2-3 shot someone, do it again with without you good gear.   Let natural selection sort out the details. 
---
#3 is really the only good thing here. I've wanted a game like that for a while bu nothing fills that itch.
---
T51B power armor 
---
I got one from Welch train station a couple months ago but haven’t seen one since.
---
Silva homestead has like 100 corn and razor grain. Dyer chemical has strangler bloom and pods
---
&gt; Hell even add perma death. Make people take thing for granted.
---
As an option sure, otherwise that idea can go fuck right off.
---
Holy crap that looks really nice
---
I love how everyone is complaining about op builds while my lvl 24 alt account just for pvp is bringing in 10k caps at time and all I'm doing in sniping with a lvl 10 standard hunting rifle
---
The constructive criticism was given weeks/months ago when this was announced.  It should have been a clean slate server in the ruleset of survival for new characters only.  Now it's a cluster fuck BECAUSE they didnt want to listen.  So Im not holding my breath, at all.  Fighting with other lowbies is fun, getting hit once and dying from a lvl 370 is super fun and exciting....not.
---
Or, any character made in survival mode is only matched with other "hardcore" survival mode enthusiasts that can agree that starting fresh is the correct way to do this mode, and only way that makes sense.
---
Yeah, this seems to be about the best. While you couldn't outright disable legendary effects towards players because of ammo count effects and I believe rof (been a bit since I played not too sure it rate of fire effects is in this game), but you could severely nerf it so it's almost like a completely basic gun just with mods on it. That should help a lot, hopefully. 
---
I've not played survival myself, been busy at work, but I'm pretty excited to test it out
---
All the xbox servers have become is a place for spawn campers to rake in caps and aid
---
What a masturbatory post
---
None. If you start at level 1 in survival mode and work for everything, you deserve it. You actually survived something. 
---
Owning kids on your exploited/duped level 287 carebear is just circlejerk material. 
---
that place you farmed/exploited all your op gear and now prey on the weak lowbies?  Get over yourself mate.
---
I thought they will make it so people will want to pvp. Reducing max caps you can lose per death to 50 or removing it completly. What they did, they doubled caps you lose and also add that you lose aid, every kind of aid, in some high percentage. Why should i want to risk so much in game, where you will probably be oneshoted even with best gear?
---
Nah it's bugged, I killed like 50 in nuked whitesprings over the course of a few hours and no progress.
---
So this is interesting. From Wikipedia, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)#Difference_between_fragmentation_and_shrapnel it seems clear that what I said originally was correct. It's strange that the dictionary link you provided lists them as one in the same. Typically though from my understanding is that if it's metal or hard injects caused by an explosion, it's fragmentation.
---
And you shouldn't :)
---
I hate losers who replay to things they don’t like  and not just downvote

How would 'Slap Damage' mechanics work with our CAMPs? If we werent hostile back, would they still be able to destroy our CAMP in adventure mode?
---
hmm they dont seem to be
---
I agree with the fresh characters. Still have quests but no map indications. 
---
Everyone I fought dropped like 1 stimpack and spoiled meat lol.
---
Maybe whatever I heard was just for survival mode. 
---
It was a lot more fun when the server just came up, and everyone was making new characters, the pvp was actually enjoyable, not this op one shot crap while they mic spam you.
---
Kill yourself to get off leaderboard or have a friend do it.
---
I guess the most important part is the no legendaries
---
it wont make any difference if you start a new character or not that will happen no matter what, and time is the other factor that it doesnt matter what Bethesda does it wont fix it unless they make lvl based servers.  i did took my main character on survival I played around 3 hours with it, never got into a fight or no one tried me either and the server I was had all higher and lower than me, no problems unless I looked for it, got rocked a few times and I killed a few as well, overall it was a hell of a time. 
---
then I made a new character and jumped on survival, I get the ppl on my server didnt mess with the lvl 1 dude and actually has a few encaunters were ppl gave me stuff, told me to rock on and they will see me when my lvl is higher.  no one messed with me until I got to lvl 25 and then it got fun fighting ppl close to my lvl.(after a while a few 100+ showed up and it was cool they just sat there and watched the show.  I am sure not everytime I get on survival will be like that, and i know somedays it will suck.
---
you just have to be ready at all times and be smart and think outside the box, dont be carrying tons off junk and aid and keep you caps at a minimum, so when ever that day comes they dont get shit from you. 
---
overall I would say yes it was more intense play for the fact that you need to be on your toes, but other than that it wasnt any different than playing in adventure mode, for me becuase I have always done PvP. 
---
rock on!!!!!!!!
---
It is known 
---
Too far?
---
They haven't been nerfed. Pro-Tip, if one of the major play styles has been nerfed you'll find out long before 12 hours after any given update. Read: TSE nerf
---
As far as anyone can tell there are no verified drops, the few people who actually talked about their masks purchased them from someone else, leading everyone to believe they were Dev room items
---
Radshield, Radaway sans radx?
---
Of fucking course it is
---
Can I quote this? Lol. So truuuuuue
---
Alright thanks
---
My fresh lvl 15 was 2 shotting lvl 100s in full x-01 power armor. damage appears to be normalized in such a way that armor and damage output don't really matter. The only thing that really helps is a full assn/sent set with 1 chameleon piece, at which point the tankiness just becomes insane.
---
Basically - if you don't have full assn/sent, just stay out of pvp servers. There's no point.
---
Thanks! Hopefully I can add some more detail sometime. Downside is super mutants hate it lol
---
It's terrible if you get Scorched, but the town is usually divided with one enemy type on the outskirts and usually Super Mutants or Scorched inside the walls.  If you get Ghouls outside the walls, there's a good chance for 1-2 legendaries (always check the diseased ones for hidden one star loot).  Big B's and Thunder Mtn Substation are a quick walk as well.  There's also another random spawn just past the railroad underpass with the two tents, following the tracks to Berkeley Springs, where I commonly run into a pack of top level super mutants, a deathclaw or scorched.
---
You can always tell when super mutants and scorched are legendary, because they will do everything they can to run away from you.
---
I completed the quest the day after launch. Did most of it in beta and the tapes lost their quest status when the quest line was over. 
---
Try the r/Market76 subreddit. 
---
Just heads up on the berry mentats. There seems to be a bug when you take it, others in your area get the same affect, as if you guys were teamed up. 
---
Sure i was able to take down the rat i was hunting, but it also highlighted me for orbital strikes from a nearby by party. 
---
Yeah I predicted it was going to be like this, kinda hilarious actually
---
I stopped with PvP after I hit 150 or so. The caps I was loosing was ridiculous versus the player I killed only rewarding 70 even though we had equal exchanges I still lost so much. Now with me at 230 I avoid PvP like the plague. I can back out to the main menu so fast it isn’t even funny. I had to create a new character for the PvP survival server just so I can try and earn the legendary rewards. Currently leveling in adventure until I hit 60 or so. If only the cap payout was capped a 50 for adventure 100 for survival. That way it would be more fair and based on player skill/build and not “I’m lower level so I’ll gain more caps even if you kill me more”
---
It was my first quest I completed. No issues. Did it about a month ago. Wasn't really sure what I was doing either and now can't remember much of what I did or what the items I got for finishing it does. I think I sold all the stuff to the vendor. Wish I didn't now because I heard the items help with stealth.
---
No legendaries, full loot. A true survival game experience.
---
We all know where it would go, there's only one good place to send it.
---
If you don't want to get shot in the face by a high level character, don't play the game mode designed around high level characters shooting people in the face. 
---
Survival gives extra experience because there's a higher risk of you wasting time respawning. Survival gives legendaries because you have less chance to grind them in peace, less chance to farm events without repercussion. There is otherwise nothing else that survival gives that adventure doesn't, except fewer limitations on how people can shoot you in the face. 
---
If you want a game mode where pvp is fair, try adventure, you can slap challenge folks or hover around workshops. If you want a game mode where one side in pvp is vastly superior to the other, try survival. 
---
That's when you save a gameplay clip (I'm on ps4) as evidence. I do it with any interaction that feels dodgy, just in case
---
I'm talking about the problem of the launch of the beta. I know that you will have to deal with higher level players no matter what but make the survival with fresh characters not allow ones who have perfect builds already. 
---
The max damage you can do to a player in one hit has been limited so yeah, that’s a nerf to melee.
---
Bummer :/
---
So just pvp? That’s a relief.
---
That actually does sound fun lmfao, just laying there dead watching everyone get destroyed with the AI all over the place.
---
Check the river that runs in the Mire. 
---
So after tonight i don't think we're getting what most of us wanted here, It is kinda obvious now that survival mode isn't meant to be a harder version of the game and bethesda wanted to turn it into some kind of battle royale arcade experience. It is almost like they just reskinned the hunters hunted into a different mode to sucker everyone to sign up, but this mode is a waste of programming hours with the whole top three peeps showing on the map.  
---
Radx diluted only, that's not the issue.  I was taking &lt;1/s until my suit broke, then &lt;2 for 20 min.  It only spiked when I approached her.  It was like jumping into a pool of nuclear waste barrels.  It could possibly be WHERE she landed, but it happened 4 or 5 times and I had to back off.  Every other time I've done the event I could run right up and swing away with no added rads.
---
Don't even need to add the go-to-Event part. Just be a live long enough to be a lucky chosen on the leader board...for being alive. Congrats you are now visible on the map just for, living.
---
Yeah I should of did that before making this post.
---
I just may do that. I don’t know anyone who plays. 
---
I'm 241, and I don't feel like losing 241 caps each kill. Survival is a no for me.
---
The 850 caps was a bounty placed by someone you killed.
---
Does any one know how the reward will work? Will it jus be rewarded to the character that completes it? A plan to craft said weapon would be nice. Similar to an atom shop purchase that way I could get the weapon on any character I use. 
---
A tad bit
---
Good lord, man.
---
Awe man, I sold my Anti-Armor LMG last week!
---
I’d keep testing see it keeps happening 
---
Sensible precaution to ensure they don't lose everything.
---
Welcome to adulthood. :-)
---
not gonna do survival anyway until legendary vendor comes out, i can free my stash from my collected legendaries and then put in my actual junk in again in order to avoid the risk of losing all my stuff.
---
If you feel you're doing less damage in PvP I just want to throw this out there, there's the suppressor perk that will debuff your damage output when you get hit from another player. There's plenty of variables you need to look at before jumping on the nerf band wagon.
---
You are assuming all the high level people with good gear cheated for it.
---
I agree with the open pvp just make it to where when you launch a beta for a mode have it to where it's like playing the game again for the first time. Make a fresh characters not import            Mr.maxlvl perfect everything. 
---
They can’t scale the servers by your level ? Like keep  1-25, 26-50, 75-100, 100- whatever with ppl
---
With similar lvls in same server?
---
Oh thank you! I noticed it did that with previous Order of Mysteries holos but wanted to confirm before I go through all the headaches of starting from scratch and doing all the other quests.
---
I do agree with this, meanwhile releasing a billion masks that weigh nothin.[mission accomplished ](https://cdn--stream-httpid-com.cdn.ampproject.org/i/s/cdn-stream.httpid.com/c202/wp-content/uploads/files//missaccomplished360_762561476.jpg) 
---
If I could give you gold for this I would, cause being downvoted by the dudebros who have loll33tdupedgear from "adventure mode" at 300+ levels think its 100% A-OK to ya know, kill some poor level 5 guy. In their book thats all good.
---
Prime shenanigans! I just got blasted out of a bush and flew for miles, funniest thing I've ever seen, 11/10 would get launched into space from shrubbery again 😂👌
---
You get caps and stuff you can sell got caps after completing an event. Depending on how far you are from the event, I think it is worth it.
---
I like to call it "outrage culture".  Once society decided to cheapen TRUE outrage and turn every little human foible into a civil rights issue, it's easy for any group or community to do that.  Play video games and want to feel like a special snowflake?  Start acting like video games are an outrage!
---
No worries. And thank you. Even at level 70 with some melee perks, the Blade of Bastet is still useful.
---
Yeah survival mode is trash. You can only respawn at your base, vault 76, or train stations. Many, many times I'd die immediately after spawning because idiots would be waiting to spawn trap. There needs to be a 5-10 second buffer where no damage can be done to you, but you can do damage after spawning. I believe that might stop it.
---
This game just REALLLLLYYY wants players to be on the map. WE DO NOT WANT TO BE ON THE MAP Bethesda.
---
Yeah I wish I woulda known more back then lol
---
Literally no one cares. 
---
Ok.
---
Normally, your squad leader picks who has that job based on who he thinks can best handle the weapon. The training for it isn't really any different than any other weapon and every infantryman learns how to break it down to clean it and qualifies with it at the range.
---
Well only 3 people showed up cuz whoever launched that nuke did it wrong. You shouldn’t have to fight her in the nuke zone at all if they make sure that just the edge of the zone hits the fissure. 
---
Yeah, it really threw me off.  Like I said, I avoid the queen because I don't want to make it harder for others as I can't really hurt her in the air.  I ground and pounded hermit crabs, a mirelurk queen(which the SBQ will fight) and whatever else came around.  All good until she landed.  I'm kind of thinking it might have been where she landed.  Maybe she regenerates on a fissure?  I don't know but I'll definitely try it again.  No way to withstand that many rads for more than a few swings/hits.
---
Same here bud, it's clear the damage glitch is back again this guy would not die no matter how many times I shot him and he was on like %10 health. I tried a handmade a pump shotty a double barrel, nothing seemed to work 
---
I don't mind the leaderboards. It's the icons on theap that give the location of the top 3 players in the server that bothers me. We shouldn't be punished for being good at the game.
---
I'm lvl 425 so not
---
Yeah bunch of griefers from the time before survival whine because the only place they can grief is a place where they get griefed. Ain't Karma wonderful?
---
I don't know... I'm not ruling that out. I'm just saying people who say the solution is to just  not allow people to bring in their characters from regular to survival are not looking at the real problem (which is they need to find some way of limiting higher levels from going after much lower levels. And also honestly spawn camping which to me is an even more blatant problem that if they had looked at other MP games they'd realize that's a common/known issue and that it is poor design to have set spawn points that can be killed soon as the person spawns in).
---
Well then 850 is to be expected. It is 2x your level
---
You can pretty easily escape the spawn traps. I did.
---
Some would say the sun was shining brightly today when others would say it’s too damn hot. Do you think they are both commenting on the same topic or just different aspects of it? I wasn’t conflating anything with something else and if you missed the point of my post then I guess you just missed it. That’s okay though, most seem to know exactly what I said and who it was directed to; nevertheless, I appreciate your reply.
---
The game was ridiculously buggy at launch. Honestly, 90% of the criticism was correct.
---
Actually, the only thing I'm assuming is that all high level people with good gear didn't get it in Survival Mode. Which defeats the whole purpose of something called Survival Mode. 
---
It certainly doesn't help that a large number of them are also exploiting cheaters who wouldn't have that same opportunity now that the obvious exploits/cheats have been fixed. 
---
Let's be real man - 99% of the assn/sent and BE handmades owned by people are dupes.
---
The only reason I wanna play survival and it’s bugged. It’s like Beth wants me to stop playing and give up. Lol I’m not gonna but still that’s fucked up.
---
Nice build, but why would it get deleted? Are camps getting deleted for some reason?
---
"Hey. You're finally woke."
---
The rad sponge perk is really good for nukes. I always thought she could heal off of the scorched that came to aide her.   Always carry a gun. Even the lowly 10mm pistol and laser pistol and rifle are good.  The lasers are really lite. 
---
I get what your saying, but in all seriousness it won't matter after a few days. lvling is easy especially when you think about it I had yesterday  50% boost(maxed perk card, boost for survival, rested and or a few chems I was lvl 25 in no time. Now imagine someone with 10 hours a day to play he will have his build ready in no time and you will be left out anyways. 
---
And if you take the experience from adventure and apply it on survival you should know exactly what you want and how to do it quickly. 
---
The time you can play is a much bigger factor then weapons and gear. They could had everyone star fresh and sooner or later the same thing will happened. 
---
An earlier post said it only counts legendary with star. I know personally that the legendaries in Uranium fever all counted for me.
---
&gt; Which defeats the whole purpose of something called Survival Mode.
---
For the first few weeks, sure, but after that, its no different because those people would have high level good gear anyway, and you are back in the same position.
---
I didn't realize this was why, I will be accepting them from now on. Thanks for the idea!
---
Cool. You are still being an ass by assuming that without proof. You get your ass handed to you and cry "They duped, they duped!".
---
haha lul. Why you go with a lot of chems when you can lose all?
---
k.
---
Dont recall seeing the casual underarmor, that sounds interesting. May need to seek it out. 
---
If you go through and read her diary (in computer in main house section) you can find where she died and pick up the holo. Alternately, you can look up the location on google probably. I did a long time ago so I dont remember.
---
So the quad crossbows exist... that’s my white whale.
---
^can confirm, go to social menu, highlight the players name and hit mute. I can't stand heavy breathers personally so I use it a lot 
---
It still would have made the experience better to not instantly run into lvl 100+ only 4 hours into launch of the beta. 
---
Past few times I've had players try and make me PvP in adventure mode, I've just stayed dead and watched them wait then get bored
---
I was having the same issue. Someone in another thread claims that the enemies have to have stars after their names in order for them to count, but I can’t confirm that. 
---
Sgt. Major humped 20 lbs of BAR in Ko-rea in 3’ of snow up a fucking mountain and the only thing he bitched about was never having enough Commies to shoot.
---
Plus, I never see anyone in game wearing most of these armor paints.. I have seen a couple camo and that's about it. That vault metal paint and all the vault tech gun skins look so cheap and just plain lazy.
---
Its bad enough we need to find 25 in that hellscape called survival! Legendary is legendary! 
---
Is there PvP during the Monster Mash event? It says its a versus event.
---
All I read was *Man who lived in underground bunker for years supplied alcohol to local boy (14) and now their whereabouts are unknown*
---
I will check in an hour might have one
---
Yeah, it wasn't really that bad but we had no chance with 3 randoms.  We started with 3-4 SB's and took down all but the queen.  Probably harder than it needed to be, I don't know, I just happened to spawn into Watoga and went for it.  The rads from the queen were new to me.
---
This mode is a failure. I've lost 1000 caps just because I am stuck in the loading screen and people are spawn camping me. What a terrible start. Impossible to counter.
---
What do you play on? If you're on Xbox, I could help you transfer whatever you needed to an alt.
---
Yeah, they are btw totally useless against snipers/kangaroo/stealth builds. If the enemy is a bit far on a higher ground they doesn’t work
---
Thank you. I'll reread the diary. Tried to find her body, but didn't succeed. I thought maybe it didn't show up bc I hadn't made it to that point.
---
You seem really upset. If you read what I posted, you'd realize that items are not the reason why I think survival mode characters should be separate. If we want a full Fallout 76 experience in Survival and not just a battle royale deathmatch, then survival needs to be separate from adventure. As it is right now, PvP players will always go back to adventure to farm gear and items, and only go to survival to purely pvp.
---
Ah yes, and when they whack you like a meaty piñata--classic.
---
I agree! I know it’s in “beta” but out of 90%+/- of the posts and comments here today, a lot of people said screw that! 
---
Biggest mistakes:
---
1. Losing a ton of caps
---
2. Losing a ton of aid
---
3. Losing and getting killed spawning in
---
4. High level players literally killing everyone 
---
So even a good majority of people that wanted PvP are saying hold on a second. 
---
One guy said he even felt a little guilty crushing people and getting all the aid they dropped! lol
---
I kinda figured it would be hell! 
---
They should have just made people start a new character and no one would have to worry about duplicated weapons or armor and people would have to start their build from scratch! 
---
&gt;Having 2 or 3 possibly out of 500000
---
It's literally a waste of developer resources to create items that will only be accessible by such a tiny fraction of the playerbase.
---
WTF is Bethesda doing?
---
Yeah, you need to be extremely smart with your spawns. Only go for the weird train stations nobody ever goes to. Never go to the one at Whitesprings. Workshops are super important for spawn locations as well. It just stinks you cannot choose to spawn there after death.
---
Speaking of ridiculously high bounty, first bounty I got was 705 caps, like damn did it hurt that bad? Immediately after his buddy added 330 caps to the pool, with a 1035 cap bounty, I was dead in minutes as two full teams surrounded me. 
---
I hope when I dropped all that salt there was enough to go around.
---
That's the red rail bridge between Harper's and bigbys rest stop right? If thunder mountain is powered up, do you get free power? 
---
That's the best news I've heard all day honestly. 
---
I like the bounties for dealing revenge but not the time board! I also think they should make trains stations no combat zones to discourage spawn camping. So far I like the new game mode! Time to adapt!
---
I've been playing on Survival on a level 20-something with no legendaries. Well-placed MIRV frags+ demo expert one shots any level 200 in power armor. 
---
If you are conscious of your surroundings, and dump all your junk and a big chunk of your aid into your stash when you are top three (revealed on the map) you can make it work with minimal loss. When I am top three I farm interior locations so that people who come to headhunt me have to fight in closer quarters. I was doing the fire breathers and a level 141 came for me.  He found me near the end of the tunnel and killed me, but not before I dropped a MIRV right under his feet. End result= net gain of a couple hundred caps. 
---
It's not easy, and if you are being griefed that badly, ignore and server hop. But everyone who wants this game to be convenient and "hand-holdy" won't enjoy survival. I can typically go about an hour without running into someone before I inevitably am revealed on the map. And if you are desperate you can just kill yourself and pick up your loot bag to hide off the map again! In a few hours of play on my low level I was attacked twice, both when I was revealed on the map. I also got a kill on a 100+ by getting the drop on him and using a MIRV.  Survival requires a different mindset, you gotta erase the negativity and raging about the other players' build/gear advantage and just accept that the mode is geared to make death INEVITABLE. Limiting your losses in those deaths is the real trick. 
---

---
screwed 
---
...what happened in 1998?
---
Lol #1 just got there from hiding and everyone else dieing. Maybe kill count should constitute leader board position!
---
Agreed! They should have had people create new characters from the start and 90% of the problems wouldn’t be there since everyone was new today. 
---
Instead they lost players doing it due to massive cap and aid losses alone. 
---
My level 15 is two shotting anyone that isn't in full assn/sentinel gear and standing still. My level 315 gets 2 shot by anyone, period, because he doensn't have full assn/sentinel. The damage is normalized to the point that your gear doesn't really seem to matter, unless you have assn/sentinel, in which case, you have a huge advantage, but if you move you lose most of that advantage.
---
1) This game is made for 4 people and for 4 people only. It is and already was advertised as a teamplay game. So we Sole Survivors are always in disadvantage with this point and its actually a NOT fault of game mechanics or bad decision making, its just what it is and always was. Be like a Dog. Dogs are wise. They crawl away into a quiet corner and lick their wounds and do not rejoin the world until they are whole once more. Don't fight what u obviously can't and you are a survivor.
---
2) And thats not true atleats for me xD I'm getting spawn camped and one shotted and cant do shot against it. The 2 second window frame of invincibility are already over when i go out of the loading screen.  The only thing u can do is leave your stuff alone and farm elsewhere. My survival tipp in this one is: Spend more points in Perception and see every idiot running around near you with weapon in there hands, even if they are sitting in a bush u can still see them and avoid them by best.
---
3) The best thing about this is often i'm spawning with my weapon already in the hands so no 2 second protection for me.
---
4) I could always shoot em when there 'only' crouched? With chameleon armor/mutation it's a different thing.
---
5) And yeah btw still sitting in bushes with chameleon and sniper. 50 Agility points and no one can see you while your shooting :D
---
7) Nah
---
What about a h ud circle like Hunter hunted so they don't know your exact location?
---
I didn't intend to imply that they were an automatic win.
---
For the people who started a new character it is a literal death sentence. It’s like clockwork... “oh it’s that time again better put all my junk and aid in the stash and find a spot to hole up!”
---
I am level 200 so, i am ok with killing everyone :D i did kill even newbies when i had chance, back before survival, but i wont pick their junk. Losing shit you hoarded is worst feeling ever, they should change concept of that mode.
---
Ya, afaik it’s been like that since beta. It seems to be the only legendary creature that can drop a legendary higher than its own level
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Just a warning before and the blast zone after the Nuke drops!
---
ahh.very nice to know..i have bloodbugs near my camp..farm them everyday
---
I think hey said it shows up on the map when placed if not then it’ll basically be a decoration no one will use but every once in awhile because when do you actually go into someone’s base. I would think it can still be destroyed just like everything else.
---
We just have to wait for prestige respec. Patience
---
Hit me up with those spoilers my guy 
---
I think Bethesda had this kind of thing in mind when people played survival mode. Not single players running around, but groups forming so they can protect each other. People want to force survival to work as a solo experience when Adventure mode already does that for them.
---
Alot of text to suggest that the spawncamper should be highlighted.
---
Nope. I started a level 1 build this evening and had a blast. This almost feels like a true fallout survival experience.
---
It is different though. I've already tried to explain it 3 times. If you haven't gotten it by now, you're not going to... and that's fine. You'll always have your "Survival Mode"\*. I'm just hoping while this is in Beta, they'll consider an actual survival mode for the large number of players (based on these kind of reddit posts) that want dedicated survivalist servers.  
---
Some dude was using a fatman.
---
 It was glorius! I never laughed so hard.. he kept saying "pull!"
---
It was a power armor and heavy weapons parade.  So much fun!
---
yeah this game had a rocky beggining with bugs, I been on since beta, but since this year, it's been nothing but good patches and smooth sailin'
---
Haha it wasn't my first thought, but that would be a two birds scenario there. 
---
I 💯 agree with this analysis. People also have camo armor and camp the vendor bots. When talking to the vendor bam you're dead. Junk and aid gone.
---
I was whistling the parade music all week at work lol!
---
There have been times I've asked them to hit my corpse again with that explosive shotgun so I can still hang out. Next time I'm gonna try and get them to fling me into the river
---
LOL yes I did the same thing. I snuck up on a guy ... insomuch as you can sneak in power armor, but it worked! and shot him with my BE harpoon gun... only to see no damage done, and that i had pacifist mode on. Queue me scrambling to turn it off and dying while in the menu. Oh well, lesson learned lol.
---
The thing about this is: Yesterday i just did nothing; Lvl 8 and became Second Long lived person without i ever knew. I got followed by a lvl 215 maniac that shot at me like a true raider.
---
I’ve died a few times with no diamond saying to pick up my stuff! It happens a lot! All it says is last death. 
---
It also happens in game on a lot of quests, diamonds just don’t appear. 
---
I died in a camp once and the building was destroyed, my bag was 20Ft in the air... had a diamond though! lol
---
Not sure where you camp at but ive had mine next to the overseers camp in the river for 60 lvls. Is it perfect? Nah.. but i love that spot. 
---
Yeah I’m not enjoying it personally.
---
Idk about you but I cannot see any one on my map other than the three top players and wanted players. I would love for nukes to not show where they are dropping. I’d love to nuke those dirty spawn campers t white springs station and they be none the wiser lmao
---
I think so? I’ve never actually seen anyone else doing it the same time as me. I think it’s more of competitive PvE. Whoever is the best gets better rewards.
---
I agree, but I think its bigger.
---
Anger is one of the most powerful, driving forces in our psychology.  It's as key as hunger.
---
Angry is what happens when fight or flight gets promoted with self awareness.
---
Throughout human history, collectively fuelled anger has triggered such varying things as the American Revolution to Nazi Germany.  Anger is powerful.
---
I wish cooler heads consistently prevailed, but America might be a Commonwealth if anonymous printers hadn't stirred the flames of revolution.
---
Anger is powerful tech, but like every tech it can be abused.  But unlike being shot at with a gun, its tech you can step out from almost at will... if you want to be aware of it.
---
The Internet just lets the anger cycle faster and with more anonymity.  It took a lot of effort to print a pamphlet and post it to taverns around the eastern seaboard.  Now we can make a couple hundred characters of molotov cocktail and hurl it into the bonfire.
---
I still fall into anger traps on the internet, it's a core feature of our psychology.  The sad part is, we won't learn from it.  The next AAA game that comes out with any issues will immediately get Fallout 76'd and will have to weather months of furious, righteous anger.
---
You were being kill in one hit? Perhaps the second shot of two shot weapons can kill people instantly? I was surviving explosive shotguns and being left at health percentages similar to my enemies after that 1,800 combo of mine. The tesla rifle was killing me extremely quick due to how fast the instances of damage come out.
---
Group up, survivability jumps significantly.
---
I can’t remember seeing a legendary ghoul at Defiance but each time I can recall going there I’m pretty sure there was always 1 legendary scorched in the center of the base behind the military walls. 
---
Maybe I’m misremembering though.
---
If you're on PC. I will pay a fair price for the hanging snowflakes plan.
---
This should get more upvotes and a new post so Beth can see it make something out of it. This is seriously the best idea \^\^
---
I disagree. I think unstructured PVP makes sens for FO76. Just not with legendary items that are balanced for PVE and totally unbalanced for PVP, and not with VATS which is literally aimbot designed for PVE.
---
"Why does our game designed entirely for PVE not work well in PVP?" Gee I wonder.
---
Spawn traps shouldn’t exist
---
Survival mode and time on board imply the longer your alive(survive) means your winning!
---
Rad Sponge is the team one right?   I roll solo, losing Lone Wanderer makes life brutal.  I shoot her all I can, just no perks/sneak so little to no damage.  I have a Mutant's Explosive laser rifle/pistol I got a long time ago I'm thinking about speccing out.
---
agreed. And untimately what harm would it have been to give their player base all of these silly cosmetics? After all the months of broken patches, constant complaints, people quitting the game, and waiting for new content, you'd think this would have been a fantastic opportunity to kind of reward the people who stuck with this game the whole time. But nope. 
---
People always tend to have their weapons up. With a high perception build you can see them everywhere.
---
Yeah its when they dont have stars they dont count. Happens when an enemy that was legendary when it first spawned respawns. If youre getting 0 star enemys just server hop
---
Bethesda needs to read this post loud and clear. This is so crucial. We need hubs and potentially higher pop servers with higher caps. I want to see humans !!!
---
This is supposed to be supported “for years” and the best way to keep a player base in an online only game isn’t just actual DLC, but quality of life changes. I’m sure eventually we’ll get some kind of fix where we can ditch or hide duplicates. 
---
Sadly, on PC &gt;\_&lt;
---
Negan, give me half your stuff rules...lol I’m not complaining at all, I figured it would be this way but it sounds way worse from a few stories I’ve been reading. 
---
It’s also a beta... I’ve been with the 76 beta since day one and it’s improved for sure but still a little rough! 
---
I can see it getting better but a lot of players I think won’t be playing it for a while after getting destroyed...
---
They won't be sought after though? People get them then stop playing or keep them to themselves, they eventually become non-existent. Bethesda even claims to try to avoid this in the future by taking into account the results of this poll, and make adjustments to future events.
---
Yeah. It’s worth it though. I find a furious laser works well. 
---
I think we need an option to play in servers where you only lose like half your levels worth of caps, or even so caps at all. I love pvp but losing 3k caps in an hour really sucks
---
The survival mode is trash lost 1000 caps and 50 stems by being spawn camped at the train, my camp, and 76 0/10 will not play again 
---
Thanks man :) I really would like to see more cool camps myself!
---
I accidentally shot someones iconic fallout vault dweller stand thingy, got a bounty put on me instantly.
---
As a level 20 running for my life, I didn't get very far due to there being a fasnacht event nearby.
---
Thanks! Wish I had more budget to add more detailed stuff, though)
---
That juicy 20% is just a bait. 20% is not much and take you nowhere xD Do the math. 11 exp + 20% = 13,2 exp. That is taking you nowhere.
---
I found a place just like this too :)
---
Is it weird that out of the people I have talked to that have one of these rares, they are both huge fallout fans, like both played New Vegas? Maybe just me but this whole things makes no sense and is weird. 
---
Oof 
---
Out of the 40 or so people on my friends list that popped on today, only 2 played the new mode. 
---
Old man winter is missing it's not an atomic item but it a rate fatsnack drop
---
Tips for playing survival mode.
---
1. It's a semi-hardcore open PvP mode. Of course it's going to be difficult and annoying. Getting shit on by high levels is expected. Play Rust or Ark as a solo player and see what happens.
---
2. If the mode is too difficult then form a group. What's better than one player? Four players.
---
3. If it's still too difficult then play adventure mode. Why does everything have to be easy mode? Think of survival mode as the difficult mode it's intended to be.
---
Grahm can trade human those plans. What can human give Grahm?
---
Well this is good to know. I'll try to grind this to make it happen.
---
Because they're not level 5
---
The nuke not showing is an absolute must! No time to run or hide you just hear it then bam, your WASTED 
---
I got the Internet. 
---
That sounds flippant,  but it's not meant to be.  I immediately experienced flame wars and trolls and just realized that angry voices floated up because people WANTED to flame each other. 
---
Trolling and flaming was FUN.   It felt good to make the other luser experience anger.  And it felt like a video game,  just usernames in the chat room or newsgroup. Not humans on the other end, oh no.
---
Sure you could post how much you liked the latest Voyager episode... or you could scream about how much you didn't like the new chime sound effect, and rile up the natives.  And if you could find a few other people who disliked Ensign Kim, well,  now the salt could flow. 
---
Now,  though,  your flame wars can ruin careers and get lives ruined.  The idea that an angry user should be considered a troll until proven otherwise is gone now.
---
Also an exercise bike in the trailer out front. 
---
Nice honest take. I've been away but have been following the threads. Yours is one of the most beneficial for when I return. Not sure how to give karma and all but you deserve it. 
---
Rip, I feel like how bad survival mode is the toxic peeps will come back to adventure mode.
---
Can you still place your camp right outside of it?
---
Wow! At the least that was entertaining to watch. So many Mini Nukes went off. I’m sure people will suggest he had on 5 pieces of armor with the Legendary effect combo Assassins/Sentinel being as he was standing completely still. As far as his heath regenerating so much I could only assume hotkeyed various food drink items, but from your point of view their health dropped to almost zero many times.  Confusing video man. 
---
True, that is a slight annoyance. But I don't mind it to have the location.
---
Why are you carrying so much stuff into a mode where you can lose it? Stash all your junk and aid before you enter!
---
If they actually remove one shot kills then it might be enjoyable for like a week.
---
You have explained it, and I understand it, I just think it is stupid because it doesn't solve any issue people currently have about the mode.
---
What about people that start playing in a few months? Do we reset everyone’s characters again to make it fair for them? People will always be at a disadvantage when starting out, just push on through. 
---
I spent all of mine before entering survival, apparently so did everyone else. I kinda wish I had just held onto my caps instead, pvp just isn’t for me. 
---
Yep no weapon makers do this unless it’s a training prop (plastic, rubber or wood). It just looks fake and cheap. Seriously they believe in 100 years the military will use either bare metal or manufacturer’s branding paint? 
---
I would build in workshops but that is ruined by ppl who kill me even though i'm in pacifist mode then they leave the camp empty until I try to claim it again or they just hop servers after taking it. Forcing players who like to build to battle with players who like to pvp is an all around terrible feature. 
---
i get how it can be and "oh shit" moment but it should make you stop playing the game, I did had that oh shit moment and at that point its all about the intentions from that person. that unfortunally we can not control. 
---
But at the end off the day its up to you what mode do you play in.
---
im just trying to get ppl to undrestand that yes it does put the new player at disadvantage it not the real problem. 
---
on top off that I have been playing on my main working for pvp after they said that PvP servers was coming out. How is that fair for us and i know im not the only that did the same.
---
it is what it is, and bethesda can not please every want/needs. 
---
we just have to wait and see how it plays out, and im sure we will see some adjustments real soon. this new mode is a new experiance for everyone and im exicted to see how everyrthing plays out. 
---
They were at zero health multiple times and still didn't go down. Wow. Then one shots you lol. Yeah, I would be salty too. I think I counted 4 times you should have one that battle. 
---
Yeah it was really loud, like I was standing at the machine myself.  Glad to hear I'm not the only one, though. 
---
Things will be changing with the summer update. Once you hit level 50 you'll be able to prestige and become more powerful somehow. No ETA on when the summer update starts, I bet june though.
---
The fact that i dont know what assn/sent means tells me i may be in for a bad time if i try survival
---
I kinda like the sound, the train whistle is great. But yeah, hearing it for hyperbole miles is kinda much. 
---
Wow, hadn't thought of that. Maybe I should have just gotten rid of the shit in my full stash to make space for them. 
---
I all ready did this for ppl
---
i'm hoping its an actually winter themed map, higher levels, deadlier radiation, temperature, you know, the good stuff :)
---
It's the lesson we learn from every JRPG ever made. The real treasure is friendship.
---
Wish I could visualise something like this, it’s amazing 
---
Yes to faction system 100%. Personally: I honestly believe Survival Mode should've been worked on more. Now I understand it's in 'beta' form so there's still hope to really save it, but until then it's very unbalanced. Survival Mode was meant to be Adventure Mode with less restrictions, not some bullshit TDM-BR mode. I'm still going to hold out hope that Bethesda really fixes it up over time.
---
Now a Faction Mode I would definitely get into in a heartbeat! Faction territory - Faction HQ fast travel points - actually making a difference by claiming territory for said faction (Brotherhood of Steel for me obviously) - ranking up in said faction with rewards/perks after each rank (Similar to ESO) I mean we have the Brotherhood of Steel power armor paint schemesat last so why not make them seem meaningful. it would be awesome.
---
Missing two.  
---
Just up the road (NNW) from Lewis &amp; Sons Farming Supply on the right side of the road (as you head NNW).
---
There's a hunter's camp or something NW of Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm - on the road below that is another random spawn.
---
I like to farm legendaries in W Emergency and at Old Mold Quarry
---
Wait...so if you can hide for hours without being found, you win?
---
the unwilling sacrifice was accepted, praise be mothman
---
How would fresh characters solve this? There would be level 50's already if survival mode required a new character.
---
Robco used to be pretty decent, now all I get is one-star wood and leather legs. It changed drastically after one of the patches. 
---
"beta" is just sad and lazy for a triple a game.
---
Yes, had someone do this to me during the Fasnacht Parade. I wouldn't have cared if it wasn't for the fact that:
---
* 1. The parade prevents PvP if you have the quest active. So this player declined the event specifically to kill me.
---
* 2. I was not able to fight back because I had said Fasnacht event quest active.
---
* 3. This is generally a scummy tactic in general and isn't true pvp. 
---
It probably wont work forever. But since you can't fast travel, if everyone is far away and killing each other, you end up surviving longer than they do. I was more likely to die from a mole rat than another player, once I got away from the Vault. 
---
It's definitely sentinel armor of some kind. I was fighting him before that too, firing my lever action directly into his head point blank while my friend fired missiles at him. His health didn't budge an inch, but the moment he started to move, we did some damage. I dunno why it was actually hurting him in that clip though. Maybe the game just glitched on the first encounter, or it wasn't showing his health bar correctly
---
" I barely tolerate the sound of people eating at the table with me " thats a mental health problem and can be fixed btw ... other then that, i agree.
---
They are only exciting when you have a chance. If you’re below level 50, and a level 200 wants to kill  you, he just does it. There’s no fight to be had in that situation because the weapons and health of a level 50 cannot touch the same of a level 200. It’s just not fun knowing that someone can teleport near you and slaughter you for resources whenever they feel like it. 
---
That’s not how all player encounters go, but enough so to make the game frustrating. I understand I can’t change it, but that’s why I would have preferred a traditional fallout game. The online just changes the formula so much that it’s nearly impossibly to play like a normal fallout game. I’ve still had fun with it for what it is and I’ve enjoyed what I played, but without grinding every night for weeks I can’t reach the point of being able to compete. 
---
I guess that much is on me for not wanting to grind, but I always have loved the exploration, the lore, and interesting npc’s or dialogues in whatever form they appear and learning about the world. In the past games, you could play the game any way you wanted and still be successful in it, but there’s a very cookie cutter way situations in this game can be handled gameplay wise or other player wise. 
---
Longer than I meant to make it, but I just really think a few aspects of this game make it frustrating to enjoy at times. 
---
No, you don't understand. And as I said, that's fine. 
---
I’ll check em out! Thanks!
---
That's how hide n seeks works, yes.
---
I was salty at the time, but now I'm just fascinated. I really wanna know what was going on there.
---
Lol I wish I found that
---
Survival is double payout so it would be 482 caps from you each time someone killed you.
---
I'm glad it's by hours, now I've made 1st on a server I never have to try it again lol. I'm up for PvP players having it how they prefer it, though. It should be fun for you guys. 
---
That’s a good way to divide the players base and not play with your friends no thanks 
---
Add well rested and cranberry relish and you're at 45%. It adds up.
---
Gear is secondary factor and people for which its 100% of this competition are not ready for it even if you gave em all they ever wanted.
---
Wonder why it shouldn't be. 
---
Pretty sure its a 4th wall joke.
---
they fixed it on this patch lol ..wasn't in notes but hasn't started playing music and i have logged out fast traveled everything :) finally a good stealth patch
---
Dude, the living room is so cozy! :D And overall amazing build! Location is spot-on!
---
Outstanding post, thanks. 
---
There is a couple of spots with low chance Legendary, (% based on 20 runs) - 
---
 
---
1. Generals Steak House 10%
---
2. NRA Repair Yard 5%
---
3. Appalachian Antiques 10%
---
\[I did this a couple of months ago\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aps379/legendary\_looting\_observations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aps379/legendary_looting_observations/))  and our results are very close. The interesting thing is West Tech, 20 runs, 20 Legionaries, same % as you, but when I run it now (admittedly I'm not keeping track)  it feels more like 50%. RNG &gt;:(
---
For the test I hopped server after every one, but if you are loot looping, and find a stocked server, the legendaries respawn after 25-30 minutes.  (despite what I observed in the testing the respawned star level is random)
---
Usually before I log out for the night I jump to Vault 76 and drop some of my extra things (food, ammo, chems, mats) into one of the bodies there, I include a bottle of Vintage Nukashine as well. :)
---
It was great! I loved the singing protectron!
---
Not totally true either. Just did this and they didn't count unless they were three stars and u killed them all yourself. This has worked for my friends but not for me so far. One and 2 stars didn't count for me either.
---
The plans for Shielded Raider and Casual are extremely rare drops. I can make both. If you are on PC look me up. iGN: jchamlin
---
Anger is sometimes warranted though.  **It's what to get angry about that is being poisoned and corrupted.**
---
Also IRL, death cures them
---
That's is true asell. But u should only lose caps per level till 50 theb a standered 100 caps per kill imo
---
If PvP is level scaled I'm not really sure why the caps/level thing exists tbh. I'm level 170 and I managed to break even yesterday even though I died way less times then I murdered. Level has nothing to do with how difficult someone is to kill, it's all about builds and gear. A lot of players are going in with no caps as well to make it even worst. And yeah if I was level 400+ I would definitely be emptying my caps or stating a new character, you are a walking piggy bank! 
---
I usualy run to Lucky Hole Mine with my Excavator and grab all the lead from the deposits, usually walk out of there with 350-400+ Lead Ore, my usual problem is not enough Steel but with the change to Scrapper collecting enemy weapons and breaking them down solves that.
---
This makes me crave stone walls. Nice.
---
Good Bot
---
Drink one with them, next time.  
---
"Whoever lands closest to the Vault wins!"  
---
"*What?*"
---
Im gonna sit at sunnytop now.
---
Capping the caps is a good idea, need something to base it on build, gear choice and skill
---
Personally, I'm a fan of the drums. I play them every chance I get.
---
A lot of the “legendaries” I find at West Tek drop syringers for some reason. A lot more than any other location. I also noticed at West Tek for some reason a lot of Super Mutants don’t attack me unless I get right up to them so I actually have to hunt for them. I go through the whole building and then retrace my steps and usually find 3-4 super mutants that never showed themselves. These Super mutants seem to be legendary more often.
---
I made a kind of circuit out of this list. Will have to check out Old Mold and add it to the loop. Thanks!
---
It would have happened anyway eventually, people that are just starting the game should just start in Survival really. 
---
I love my bloodied light machine gun. I only use it for bosses because of the ammo. I also got a bloodied gatling gun for anything else. Its decent, slow, and uses the cheapest ammo type.
---
Tbh that sounds cool as fuck
---
Came across one bag with 80 stimpacks and 6 super stims. It is nice for sure.
---
I thought everytime you fast travel you a a time period were you we invulnerable to attacks?
---
I really gotta do that
---
How long did this take? Amazing!
---
So...you know those trap houses people keep building?  
---
Welcome to Bethesda's version.
---
It really is quite simple though. If you don't want to pvp, stay in adventure mode. It literally cant get any easier. 
---
O M E G A L U L Z 
---
Just people overreacting as usual, this would have realistically happened within 5 days anyway even with their so-called fresh start. 
---
Heck no. I thought it had mods but it turns out the only mod it has is the prime receiver which you can't get by buying the weapon plan.
---
Hi, this is my first post on reddit, I wanted to thank you for respecting our protest, I think you are around the 7m20s mark.
---
 ​@Raknorok said:
---
&gt;*As the last remaining survivors of Appalachia, you can imagine our disgust when we found out there were robots marching in our parade. We don't appreciate robots taking our jobs, so we organized a protest for the parade, enjoy.​*
---
This is the supercut of all our parade protests. We made it our goal to "Block the Bots" and ensure as many robots died as possible. I hope @Bethesda-Game-Studios sees this and realizes how much more interesting this event could have been. But at least it was something, we made the most of it and had the most fun yet. I don't expect anyone to watch entire thing, if you do, be prepared it's 13 minutes long, enjoy the drama and thank you, or not. See you in the wasteland.

---
I don't recall anything like that - but if you get the tiny wooden bench and a decent shelf or table, you might be able to make a redneck one.
---
With the amount of cult/church/altar builds people have been doing, I wouldn't be surprised if it's tossed in eventually.
---
The only mod it has is the prime receiver, which you can't get by scrapping.
---
Then dont play it untill you have better gear
---
Bethesda already made a fix for the problem you are having. It is called adventure mode.
---
I have been seeing a ton of these posts lately. Can't wait to rub it in my friend's faces once this game get's a "NMS second chance" treatment (lol jk but not really. I really want to do that). Anyway, back to the original topic. Yeah, I will be one to admit, the release had a rocky and horrible launch. I have been playing the game since BETA, and I think the reasoning behind the server instability is still due to the exploits (which are now patched out) and because of that, it caused everybody to have a bad time. There was the unlimited carry weight glitch and dupe glitch that mainly did this. Still, I saw potential in this game and that is why I stuck to it. There are still things that need to be worked on (like weapon balance for both PvP and PvE) and some minor bugs here and there, but those are minor compared to what the devs had to deal with at launch. I wish you happy hunting, vault dweller and welcome you to the Fallout 76 Community with open arms.
---
For anyone looking for mods by scrapping multiple light machine guns: there are no mods for this gun aside from the prime receiver which you can't get by scrapping.
---
It only works at vault 76 right now atm
---
90% off the problems would had move a few days or weeks down the road. What your saying is just a temporary fix.
---
Time to play is a bigger factor than weapons/gear.
---
Is it too hard to understand that this would have happened in 2 days even with the so called "fresh start"? People with a proper build will always destroy low levels players, there isn't much that can be done for that 
---
I was looking forward to survival, I liked the idea of not seeing my player on the map and the fear factor that any encounter with a player could be more hostile but at the moment the risks far out way the rewards so I'll be giving it a miss.
---
For a 20% exp increase and possible legendary drop it's not worth losing a f#$k load of caps and 90%+ of my aid items in doing so.
---
I might give it a try eventually with a new alt character once the survival servers have died down in a couple of weeks or so, trying now would be suicide as everyone is camping spawn points for easy kills, I'd be lucky to survive a few minutes lol
---
Mirror ball plan 
---
Yeah, but it’s  “the road” sim for me...running scared 
---
Ok I don't think you get the fact that if donee right  a lvl 10 -lvl 40 can mess up a high lvl players day my lvl 24 alt is making Bank ATM just from killing lvl 279 -300 people 
---
Players are not visible on the map. Only visible players are the one thats the top of the leaderboard and anybody who had a bounty on their head. 
---
The Cuckoo clock.

WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?
---
I need it
---
Ass sent can be countered with one thing vats crit
---
It's honestly painful to watch, having rng combo of armor make you almost unvulnerable to attack then he surely vats os you, not even aiming
---
Yes, combined with a dense mod on your chest piece, it will negate it pretty much
---
I am level 103 with all the guns and armor i could ever want
---
It's on fire right now because the mod currently has a LOT of players who 
---
1) thought they were 'gud' preying on pve players but actually aren't and they're having rude awakening (lmao). 
---
2)the PVErs who somehow miss the whole point of the mode being PVP oriented and feel entitled that it should be slightly harder PVE mode and made pikachu face when their new lv1 get killed right outside (roll eyes). 
---
All PVE players wanted was some PVE on a PVE server - they'll be happy if you give them a PVE server - they don't even have that yet and they've been made quite happy with this patch. PVP players get given their own server and they make up every excuse why they don't want to play on it, they want more incentive! It's too rough! Costs too much! Cheaters are everywhere! Nerf legendaries! Nerf melee! Nerf stealthboys! Nerf one shot kills! Nerf two shot kills! Nerf HP! Did I miss anything? Probably.
---
Well, don't make a new one in this mode.  It's a dog eat dog world out there. Don't be a bitch.
---
What they should actually do: Nerf Assassin/Sentinel since it's way too OP rn. 
---
Not to mention people know where the spawn points are and kill you, despite you supposed to be temporarily invulnerable
---
Yes but it would all be gained in survival. I can just go farm for OP items in adventure and go in survival with the gear I got easily without any risk l
---
That's the point. Camps are gonna be immune to player damage in Adventure mode in due time, so let them be destructible in Survival.
---
Step it up. My highest killing spree was 57 and I left because I had to take a shit.
---
Nothing would have changed if they actually did that, it would only made it worse for most of us to get high level weapons as well actually. 
---
No. 
---
I mean, I guess that would be better but I would prefer it to not show at all. Naming the top 3 seems okay to me, but not exact location or hud circle. No one is going to want to be number one if the whole server comes after them.
---
I think it being a BoS made weapon it’s just like that. They always seem to have the best made gear. 
---
My older hunting rifles always had that iconic kick and bolt cranking animation. 
---
They chose to jump into the deep end.  Let then drown. 
---
Might be a silent nerf. I noticed it too. 
---
L.A.M.P system. 
---
Git gud. I've had no issues and I'm having a blast!
---
I, too, think Player Kill or Enemy Kill count should constitute towards the top 3. I do not mind the blips on the map for top 3, but make it so it is whoever is killing the most. It would make the most sense as it is a PvP mode. I get it, it is called "Survival" mode, but I think there needs to be a change to how it put's people in the top 3. Maybe not stop there. Why not base the top 3 on all the leaderboard categories and average it out (for example: I survived 1 hr, I am number 1 in that category, but I am last in kill count and in the middle for the rest of the categories. It could average it out and I would be probably rank 9 or 10 in the leaderboards). I can see how that could have issues though so I think the easiest solution would be to tie it to enemy or player kill count.
---
Or maybe your camp?
---
You mean players pvping and killing one another in a deficated pvp mode is not an intended mechanic?
---
&gt;  Bethesda whats the deal here, is this intended? 
---
Yes that is what's intended.  Bethesda said in the patch notes that there was re balancing, as there should be.
---
You can't have a handful of builds that are invincible with all other builds being completely useless.  And that has been the state of PVP up to now, Good to see that they are fixing it.
---
🥇🏆🏅
---
Mines working fine. Got a kill streak of 57 today just sitting top of a building with my gauss.
---
You drop your level in caps?
---
WOW, I didn't even know that existed till now
---
From all accounts I've read on here that doesn't appear to be working.
---
I don't feel like having the threat of PvP hanging over me *at all times* so I'll only use Survival when I really want to fight some people, or so I can try and work on the weekly challenge. Otherwise I'm fine with sticking with Adventure.
---
*Flatwoods Monster Intensifies*
---
Yes it’s to show you if a nuke has been launched from that silo since there’s the 3 hour (?) cool down period and it won’t let you into a recently launched from silo. If it says “Launch Prep Required” it’s good to go into that one.
---
You’re welcome :)
---
It’s not that everyone wants everything nerfed. All anyone wants a balanced game where everyone can grow and carve their ways. Sadly duping changed that and the caps that it created. 
---
All we wants is equality from the start and what that means for the future of the game. 
---
Or maybe just, kill them? Why let anybody kill me? It's more fun yo watch their corpses fly lol
---
Type that same title in google and you’d have your answer in seconds. 
---
Don’t hold me to it, but I think that’s the only plan unique to him since the update were they moved plans around.
---
I both love and hate that eerie feeling of being in a place that was previously used for a huge gathering, and is now empty. Like after a music festival when the clean up begins. 
---
Just buy a sentinel assassin 4head
---
In Adventure mode, yes, and in survival it's double. 
---
Just don't get killed.
---
&gt; Now I understand it's in 'beta' form so there's still hope to really save it, but until then it's very unbalanced. Survival Mode was meant to be Adventure Mode with less restrictions, not some bullshit TDM-BR mode. I'm still going to hold out hope that Bethesda really fixes it up over time.
---
It sounds like you don't "understand it's in beta form"? :-)
---
Genious labeling.
---
&gt;Recon scopes and the helmet mod for PA.
---
Which PA mod?
---
I am glad I play on PC because of this. PTT is a godsend. The social experience is probably better on console, though, so I will give y'all that. On PC, we can't PM people. Sometimes, when I engage in PvP, I always wish we can receive salty PMs from those we kill. Call it trollish if you will, but as it stands, PC doesn't have much of a social atmosphere because of no universal social platform and those who team up tend to use discord.
---
Thanks for the test dude. Also note that chameleon and sentinal can't work together. Sentibel u have to ve standing literally for it to work as soon as u crouch it's disabled.
---
Wow, wonder how long it took you to perfect that? Really cool looking!
---
Sensory something. I’m not online to check. I’d just google the Fo76 PA helm mods to confirm the name. 
---
Nope on you, have a downvote.  "MUH PLAYER RIGHTS!"
---
I didnt try so no idea
---
Thta's pretty much what i expected it to be after reading patch notes. Thank you.
---
If you can make the other ones- might be able to sell to the daily atom guys. I know I needed tick tequila the other day.
---
Why bother farming legendary items in survival mode when the PVP is placing you up against invincible duper campers, legendaries won’t help you against their stacked bobble heads, mags and TSEs.
---
Sensor array?
---
I'm enjoying it, as are many others. There is adventure mode for the softies...
---
Maybe. 
---
I had dozen of my friends who did it and one guy who didn't.  Maybe I befriended PvP people and you befriended PvErs?
---
&gt;dessert
---
I am now picturing someone wearing power armour designed to hide among different flavours of ice cream ;)
---
Should have read the patch notes, there's no more slap damage in Adventure - other players can't damage you at all unless you fight back.
---
True, they also pop stealth boys to counter that
---
I think we all wanna know. I've been on Vaca during this whole thing and haven't experienced it yet. Glad I can't get on now. Just reading all the posts. I woulda been real pissy if I spent 25k on some sent/Cav armor for it to not work. Either way, I've seen a lot of sent/Cav builds working precisely. One guy made close to 20k in caps in one video. 
---
I may hit you up for some shielded casual ua in the future. What do you charge?
---
I'm going on a bender this weekend, planning to do about 30, not all at once, to see where I end up. Should be good for an hour or two
---
Because there is a survival-mode-only challenge for a specific legendary reward
---
Yeah but not many do I haven't seen one yet that's popped it most just will trash talk and they want you to see them as they trash talk
---
Because EA is known for bad support.  
---
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/04/05/ea-responds-to-worst-company-in-america-contest-we-can-do-better/
---
So I am saying if *they* can provide good support, I would not give up trying to contact other companies and resolve the issues.
---
They are armor pieces that give you -8% damage from players and -15% damage when standing still in a same armor piece. You can equip 5 of then ans do the math...
---
The weekly quest is kill 25 legendaries in survival mode. Survival is actually not that bad if you stay away from problem areas and avoid PvP as much as possible. The TSE problem is still silly tho.
---
Spawn killer lol. 
---
?
---
You ain’t wrong Dylan 
---
Go bloody and you won't have to worry about special stats ever 
---
Not a big surprise since it's the PvP mode.
---
No I have welded and hardened
---
Bender = to get absolutely rat faced, drunk, boozed on Vintage Nukashine
---
I have SUCH a hard time building a two story house within budget, how did you manage all of this? It looks amazing, and I could use your wisdom. 
---
Let's just say I didn't come by corpse mode for lack of trying 😆 
---
The problem with high level players wanting to use their gear is..... its broken. Getting one shot constantly is not fun, and from reason comments so far it just seems survival is a grief zone.
---
Re: high levels "standing around" at events, I can only speak for myself but I feel bad if I show up at an event and low levels are there since I can one shot everything to oblivion. So I often stand back and let them get the XP, jumping in only when they get swarmed or obviously need a hand. Unless it's something like AWOL Armaments, since they have no business being there anyway.
---
It's a tough balance between co-op on events and dominating them bc my build is OP. I shouldn't be punished by having to sit out events just bc I'm OP same as low levels shouldn't get cheated out of XP and loot just because I'm in the area. So... balance, I guess.
---
That said, I noticed during Fasnacht a bunch of players of all levels literally standing around and not contributing a single thing, I think that's mostly lazy bullshit and just event-mooching. There's no excuse for that but *shrug* can't get too upset over how other people play the game.
---
The thing is that this way everyone eventually gets involved in pvp, which is what a pvp server is for. If the top 3 are for the most active pvp players only a small fraction of players will ever get on the leaderboard because the same 3 people will just kill each other over and over. Meanwhile most people would just hide at the edges of the map, abusing the 20% exp buff and never being involved in pvp (on a pvp server).
---
Why are you trying to PVP if you are lvl ten ... learn the game first then go pvp ... or go back to fortnite 
---
Wait, you're happy paying $15 for that? Holy shit...
---
Oh didnt know that. I play solo mostly so i havent rly had a chance to see that issue though
---
Not very profitable IMO. Mostly everyone can make them. But it's a buyer's market out there so if you post it someone may take. 
---
Yeah well, I got killed by a griefer at a trainstation which he was camping with his silly FOTM-deathclaw build. I was logged in for maybe 3
---
Minutes and I Didn’t waste any minute longer in that mode and just alt+F4‘ed to spend quality time without fo76. Hope the next wild applachia feature is more compelling for me
---
This gamemode rewards Griefers and the only upside is, that they leave adventure mode for it :) 
---
It still says I am running 1.1.0.8, but I can actually play now, so thank you!
---
Haven't gone too hard in Survival yet but the longest-living marker does seem a bit poorly thought out. "Top three" markings on the map should go to the players with the highest kill streaks per life, maybe, not just the longest time alive.
---
If you ever need any hmu xb1: Th4tsFakeNews
---
Look in the atom shop for a free poster talking about a party, you start one of the new quest that way; or finding it at various train stations. 
---
You tried wearing a beard with it? Lol.
---
Shh, friend... easy on the criticism... aren't you aware that Fallout 76 is the greatest, most marvelous thing known to man? You don't want to criticize something about this game on this subreddit. Fanboys don't like criticism, not even constructive one.
---
As for Survival, well... Vault 76 should be a safe zone, the Greenbrier too.
---
I agree on this part. Honestly, I only have 3 major complaints that need tuning or adjustments. 
---
\#1) the respawn/FT bug where you don't become invulnerable as stated in the patch notes. This can probably be easily fixed so I am hopeful. 
---
\#2) the leaderboard need's adjustments. Make it so either: A) it averages out every category and that is how you become top of the leaderboards or B) Make it so the player or enemy kill count toward's your leaderboard status. Option B is probably the easiest to implement though so I will be happy with that one. 
---
\#3) PvP weapon balance still need's some fine adjustments. I am sure Bethesda will keep balancing this out and honestly, they won't make everyone happy because either the one shot people will complain or the people affected by the one shot people will complain but for the sake of the mode, it will probably be best to adjust this so nobody can one shot. 
---
Thats the 30min. Quest i mentioned i was told there would be more
---
I run this build for so long and I didn't notice it either lol. Btw did u test this with cav asassin? Was it usless ad senti El is the only viable build?
---
Its a tricky build.   I went with Studded Heavy Leather armors because slightly lower weight and 45/77/0 damage resists on each piece; until got some good legendary.
---
I'm currently looking for wood armors as they are almost weightless and have decent resists but really boost sneak skills.
---
But I have to limit food to 10 soups; water to 5.   Only carry 1 rifle and 1 light melee (Black Diamond is free weight, being 3 lbs and +1 str).
---
Chems stacking up has been problem.  Sell all super stims (1.5  lbs), and carry 10 diluted stims.  Diluted are 0.5 lbs and normal stims are 1 lb.
---
Sell all grenades, they get heavy quickly.
---
After that, you got some weight to carry stuff!
---
Quit giving minors alchohol lol jk. It is a good way to get a FT point somewhere random in the world so when they need to travel that way eventually, they don't have to walk there.
---
I feel like normally I'll get like 10 per play session at Watoga, and then sometimes I don't get one for days. I'm never sure if they've messed something up, or if it's just my RNG. 
---
You whiners. Its pvp mode but you guys can't deal with being tracked.
---
Should Bethesda have forced a new character for this mode? Yes.
---
Should Bethesda make that character unable to back to adventure? Absolutely.
---
Should the leaderboard parameters be adjusted? Certainly.
---
Should you be allowed to spent your time in PvP permanently Hidden ? Hell no.
---
Go bloody?
---
Hilarious observation. 10/10 would see again.
---
Got my Auto Grenade Launcher plan from the one at Camp Venture, so now I've been taking the time to check it out every time I swing by to drop off technical data.
---
Some level 80 and 90 dudes gave em to me in flatwoods, after they saw me took forever whaling that pipe at those low lvl ghouls. ( i was like great, now more stuff for me to carry ) Though i appreciate their kind intent, there's a reason why i jumped with that alt account instead of my main. Now i wonder if thats what low lvl toons think when i pop up and give em stuff, their probably just alts of guys like me running around bored as hell. 
---
glad you think so, hit me when i modded my fallout 4 sentinel "mini dlc" into the enclave x01 paint and it reminded me modus would probably hack it :)
---
Can't believe I didn't think of that before, I'll have to start trying that now.
---
Well the problem with that build is you need to go with melee character then.  If that was the plan then all is good.  If its not?  You will lose out on some perks that will help out a good deal.
---
Watoga is definitely hot or miss, but Whitesprings? I have never had less than 4 there and I usually get 6 or 7. West Tec is usually another 1 to 3 and the other locations always have at least the 1. I'm pretty sure something is up.
---
Anyone have a Fallout 76 600 damage 45 cal lever gun for sale or trade? My gamer ID is replures1.
---
I would go 3000 caps.
---
I am running xbox.
---
Spotted the kid with no liabilities but school and a full bloody assasins build. Hope you and the other kids are going to have fun in your very own game mode! 
---
Honestly, single piece items are way too fucking overpriced 80% of the time in the ATOM shop. This bundle actually put reasonable prices on things.
---
If you separate it and say everything is equal prices then each single item would be just 1500/8 == ~~190 Atoms per item, which is totally OK, if you would now obviously shift it a bit and make some less and others a bit more expensive then most items shoudl be between 100 and maybe 350 Atoms unless its something super special.
---
But paying 500 atoms just for a single hairstyle or 1400 for a single paint job that does literally nothing special is just ridiculous...
---
I'm totally for this. My first thought was how would we find the zone? But everyone would scramble to high ground or hide somewhere and nuke zones are pretty ez to spot. This would be an amazing edition to survival!
---
Two words.....
---
Adventure mode.
---
This has happened to me several times, but not every single time.
---
Focus on setting up a basic camp.  Even if its very simple, near where most of your quests are.  You can easily move it.  The CAMP will help you quite a bit.
---
The only new quests they've added are the nuka-shine dailys, any new quests are scheduled for april 9th. Up until then, the game will be receiving small QoF/new feature updates.
---
I'm not sure I see it as abuse, especially if you still have the threat of a player stumbling upon you and killing you for your loot. As it stands, someone could still do what you're saying, and never end up on the board, if they just played with a friend and rotated killing each other before they got marked. No risk of losing your bag, no interruption, and you can fast travel back to your friend and return the favor. Forcing PvP is taking a choice away, in a Bethesda game that has already taken away a lot of choices. 
---
Have you tried going in settings &gt; controls and trying to change the button layout in there. Not sure it works like that but worth a shot
---
Enclave is 3str 2perc. Bos is 3str 2 end
---
Note that if you're a low level player, you will downscale everything, as in less legendaries, lower level mobs and less exp. And this should be pointed out, as lower levels are ruining it for everyone. 
---
My hope is that nuclear winter mode will fix this, and will be a game mode for good geared players and high levels and no scaling of events or areas.
---
That is why I am asking =) Because for example the Responder traveling vendor bot has several unique items and plans he can have, so want to know what can Grahm have I wouldn't want to miss.
---
I invited you 
---
The random spawn Charleston Responder bot Vendor. He has a Nuka Cola clock plan too
---
Enclave scum
---
&gt; I havent trusted the Internet's opinion since 1998.
---
Wise, very wise.
---
I would love to play survival, but the VATS problems are ruining it. My build is centered around VATS
---
i believe its the attachments, since its a fully modded gun on crafting it.
---
Hah, nice.  Fallout2 always had the best intro.
---
About Risk-Reward in survival.
---
I killed level 2, then 37 level guy killed himself when attacking me (mininuke). When I saw how much aid you lose, I immediately left survival and went to do BIV quest on adventure.  I am level 200, carring 80super stims (have full stash). **Losing 400 caps and like 60super stims per one death is no go for me.**
---
On the other hand **i am excited in killing 25legendaries** to get reward. I don't care about reward as I already have everything, but **i like challenges**. So i will probably mule my things, or get some group to do this one challenge and then leave survival for good, till next week.
---
I was huge fan of pvp before. I killed everyone i had chance to do so. **Not picking their junk**, not reskilling, if they didn't want to. I hope they do some changes about how big risk it is to be in survival.
---
Right? Enclave power armor and heavy guns vs jumpsuits and waving 😂😂😂
---
same here
---
want to know
---
Haha, that's really enticing option.
---
It’s a beta. Give it a little time and see what happens. I dislike it as much as the next one. There’s still no 100% word it’s anything in the mode is going to be final. 
---
Abuse was a strong word, but yes the current system has several workarounds. I just wish the markers were more imprecise, more of a general area, that would give the hunted a chance to ambush the hunters instead of only the other way around.
---
I have plans for both handmade and lever action 👍
---
That's the thing. Literally everyone will eventually be first, this way. The whole system is designed to make everyone take a turn being a target, which removes the choice to PvP, and forces fighting people better geared than you. If you win, your reward is to just keep fighting them until you lose. It's not fun. 
---
It’s being release in batches. 
---
I run around butt neked with chameleon mutation and a 1* AA Hunting rifle and consistently led in kills and longest life/wanted
---
I prefer the way ESO handles it. They list every possible reward for an event so you're not left wondering if you have everything or not.
---
Does anyone know if sneaking still keeps you hidden on the map even if you are in the top 3?
---
Oh, it does, if you're chameleoned on a roof with a Gauss rifle. I held out for a while, but like I said elsewhere in this thread: your reward? To have to keep doing it until you lose. 
---
Tested, it does not. 
---
I regularly check the map and hop in on events if I see another person there. I’ve been having issues with the Poseidon power plant though. Every time I join that event my game crashes before the end.
---
If your ok Xbox I can sell you a gamma gun
---
To the people who are saying oh this is to op oh this since to weak let me tell you that it's not the guns / armor that is op/weak it's the user my lvl 26 alt with.a lvl 10 crafted hunting rifle is making bank on people with the "op"armor and guns.
---
It's not that anything balance wise is broke 
---
The only fox that should be done is the stations and safe zone to many people are spawn camping them 
---
Did they fix the confetti bug, where you could make items float?
---
Basically you run a bloodied build.  Because it’s the best a man can get, blah blah blah. 
---
I been doing that, I am currently level 140 and still got 30 more levels to go, but it works!
---
Well it does give you a big pop up and lists the things that makes survival, survival, when you initially click on survival mode
---
I love that movie so damn much. One of the best I’ve seen. 
---
I guess maybe that’s just not the fallout experience I was looking for. 
---
No and just after I realised I shouldn't have ran away like a little bitch, but because he was using voice I wasn't sure to respond on the PC version, I went full brain fart.
---
Thanks for the post!  If the whiners would play like you, they might have some fun!
---
I ignored all the criticism and bought the game since i wanted Fallout 4 when it first released but never got it. and the game was not as broken as everyone was saying. I was going for weeks without encountering a game-breaking bug/glitch back in december. there were some fun minor bugs, like ragdolls stretching, grenades flying for miles sometimes, powerarmor stretching the player character model, fun shit like that.
---
I’m pretty sure we do but the loading is so fucked that we just miss the invincibility anyway
---
starting today vs launch day are 2 very different things
---
My reaction to the game is if I seen other players higher level than me to just run away. I know that being able to be killed by other players is no longer a thing in adventure mode, but I still run away! lol
---
Interesting. I was just playing and for most of the 40 minutes I was on nobody was on the map at all except the third longest survivor. I don’t know why the top two were not showing on the map. 
---
Can we please get the excavator armor bug fixed? I really hate having to change servers every time I have to exit my power armor to repair a weapon or craft a brew. Its been 6 months since release. It's embarrassing that this is still a thing.
---
Does anyone have a description of what the bundle covered? I bought it also and Wan to check all the things it was supposed to work on. 
---
That’s a good point, quest completion, just didn’t think of that. I’ve not really got into daily quests and such.
---
I thought you could only use boiled water for soup
---
&gt;stempacks
---
It's kinda funny that not one person in this whole thread spelled stimpak correctly.
---
Hmm, that would make it make more sense than it just not working
---
Thats what he talks about. Thats 4times killing Scorchebast queen. Only endgame in game. Hour of time with best team in game. In one death. Not counting aid items.
---
I think they have a few bugs to work out, still. I noticed that my "first place" survivor on the list was marked with the silver medal a few times, but as the first place player, I left my team and crouched, whilst moving out of LoS from my team mate, and never once disappeared from his map, he said. That it would refresh my exact location each time he opened the map.
---
Have you noticed party boy doesn't affect the new alcohol drinks? Only the original ones. I hope this is just an oversight as it's hardly worth drinking the new ones at the moment.
---
True. I guess the only tanglible is the exp boost. And the stuff you can loot of opponents. But the actual pvp combat can be rewarding too, if it is not too one sided 
---
Yeah they were great games too. Played em a lot as kids. Fallout 1 was the first game I played where you could beat the game with just speech checks. 
---
Uhm. So, what about in 6 months from now? There will always be new players that are lower level.
---
It's also silly that we seem to respawn at the same spot everytime (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻. Who thought of that the should be at least 15 random locations close to it
---
┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)
---
Dont buy powered gates as its always available at the robot vendor at the ski resort
---
Tell that to players who just few weeks ago bought those camo weapon skins for 700 atoms ea and now those camo skins as basically bonus to new camo PA skins.
---
Nuka-cola clock and the one with cuckoo
---
That's a great idea but maybe just the on closest. We don't wanna make it easy
---
Jesus! This is the type of thing I want to get into, but it's going to take me a long time to get there. 
---
I get that its a lot. It sucks but it is the way the pvp reward is. Its not going to scale down as you get higher level, otherwise the risk gets less the higher level a player is. I'm not disagreeing with the fact that it sucks but...
---
If it was a level 20 losing 40 caps it does kinda suck at a similar scale as they usually wouldn't have 20 caps to toss around too easily. 800+ caps is obscene but I think the amount is because the higher your level is expected to equal a higher skill level/better gear/stronger build. But I totally agree that losing 850 caps each time would really suck...
---
For Survival, absolutely not. While all the other features of Survival sound promising for a new character (greater xp rewards, limited fast travel, etc) right now its just people with high level characters who either managed to get amazing gear in "Adventure" mode / duped it / bought it whom are killing lower level characters. Its not even a "wild west" landscape where there is no law its every man for himself its literally pointless, since the longer your character is alive the greater a chance you have of showing up on the "Living leaderboard" that happens to reveal your exact location on the map. Level 3 with a pipe pistol vs Level 323 with 3 Star amazing stats Legendary Power Armor Mutated guys. You can see who wins in those situations.
---
Ill take that as a compliment 
---
thats the responder bot 
---
starburst clock as well
---
Gotta re take the pictures

Hey, don't get me wrong. I love this version of PvP. It makes me viable as a glass cannon, if I don't have to wait for them to return fire to do damage. To be honest, though, most of my fun had today wasn't in sinking meta builds 100 levels higher than me, it was the people I didn't shoot. The guys I snuck up on at the train station, and whispered to while invisible. Watching them freak out and look everywhere for me was something enjoyably, uniquely emergent. The low level I helped keep safe, who's kindness of using his camp I repayed with plans and scrap.
---
1. Because it’s super annoying making a new character in survival mode because of level 234 one shot-Ing me across the map and stealing all my Shit before I even have the chance to see the person, let alone defend myself. 
---
2. Yes, fuck your overpowered loot that was designed for a more PVE focused game. 
---
Matchmaking servers based on player level goes a long way to solving that.  
---
Same 
---
I have seen people fully geared and get killed by my lvl 26 alt with a lvl 10 crafted hunting rifle
---
it should scale up to level 50. There is no diference between level 50 and 400.
---
Well, I'm a megafan of the Fallout series and 76 fell apart, ruined it for me.   I wanted to like it.  Soooo bug riddled and as if Bethesda just forgot to make the game about something, with interesting characters, deep, broad plots and subplots, seemingly endless discoveries.  Feels like all of that was substituted for.... multiplayer. 
---
I may go back and try it again.  I put in the slog to level 14 before I just couldn't take it anymore.  Inventory Sorting Simulator v.76beta just wasn't anything like 3, New Vegas, or even 4.  The fun was gone.
---
I'm actually glad to see someone who's just picked it up and is having a blast.   That's exactly what all the other Fallouts were for me, dat feels doe.  
---
Maybe I'll try again.  I pre'd the big expensive pack (fanboi here) and was never so disappointed, but OPs experience and joy cannot be dismissed.
---
Alright, I'll try it again.   It's been 5 months give or take.  Thanks OP.  Hopefully I'll have a Fallout 76 Redd-emption and post some rediscovered joy too.  
---
Okej so they calculate the total percentage with addition? Good job
---
It is !
---
You are legit complaining about a self produced problem, bethesda announced how it was gonna work then you decided to create a new char knowing this was gonna happen
---
Based on your example, it's a total of 40% increased damage due to the Explosive effect + Demo Expert 5.  But yes, 15 add'l damage for 5 perk points is not worth it.
---
I also agree with putting a cap on the amount of caps per kill. Or the amount could be something of an average in the difference of levels between the two combatants. There should be a system in place to not favor higher or lower level players in some way
---
That was four words. Mwuahahaha!!
---
I think you can get that somewhere else but can’t remember which vendor 
---
Might want to say your platform 
---
Ain't got no space in my stash to store and collect these weapons
---
I just want the OD GREEN paint job for my clothing and PA.
---
It all makes sense now! I was one of the ones that didn’t agree with player transfers but now I see what they were going for 🤔
---
You don’t even need to go to the social menu. Just click their dot on the map and it’ll bring up the option to mute them.
---
Or do different versions every week or month - a mothman parade, a nuka-cola parade, etc. 
---
Agreed, it is more fun to team up/be friendly in survival I think. Because in adventure there is no real downside to it, its a win-win. In survival both parties have to agree on a truce or a pact, because at any one moment betrayal could happen. Therefore its not just a win-win, so when you team up with someone you know they are putting their trust in you, which makes for a deeper bond.
---
Probably no rarer than the others, I've got it twice now.
---
As someone who is a real piece of shit and built Nuke grenades just to track peoples bases and obliterate them, I agree, the only time turrets are a problem is when there’s 10 missile ones, and I’ve only seen one base with ANY missile turrets
---
why?
---
That still leaves all the level 1-7 that you constantly kill when they spawn from the vault 😀
---
Just remember those lower levels who are ‘ruining it’ was you on day one. Leave them alone 🤦‍♂️ just as entitled and invited to areas and farming as you are. This is why a lot of low levels don’t have good gear. 
---
I’m level 90 (almost) and have awful stuff because whenever I went to higher legendary spawns I got killed loads of times due to my level 🤦‍♂️ best weapon atm is a super sledge with 140HP and 40% faster 😬😖
---
Really starting to regret chucking my bloodied level 10 chainsaw 😂😂
---
without any risk, lol you made me laugh. 
---
A player hub seems like a no brainer! I don’t see why another vault couldn’t be one. Maybe we should make one on a specific spot on certain worlds 🤔
---
I have this daunting feeling that they went for the middle ground to please as many people as possible. But in the attempt they were impaled by the wall of mediocrity. Lol 
---
Agreed.  I am still bewildered as to how Bethesda cannot see it.  I'd love to know their reasoning as to why they let players freely enter each mode.  I don't see any positive arguments to why they set the mode up like they have.
---
No we don't, we like the leader boards, it gives the point of playing, makes thing interesting. I mean without it, it is just Adventure Mode, where people be like "All I want to do is do quest and events. You killed me, you are griefer"
---
Lol I kept thinking:
---
“Use vats!” “Crouch!” And then the OP puts away the lever action and brings out the auto shotty and tries to shoot at the enemy halfway across the field. Lolz
---
I read that too - I took it as more of the character realizing he was in a video game. It would be kind of brilliant if it was all a simulation within the Fallout 76 Simulation. *We’re* the participants
---
Looks a bit small.  
---
Maybe live it up a bit? Try getting other plans for beds and some more stuff to build.  
---
I need the unarmed booblehead and am interested in trading for it :)
---
Why are you in survival mode?
---
I think this might be cultural as here in Australia, this is not a problem. The game is isn't popular at all, especially for younger kids.
---
What does it say? 
---
right. it just sounds like a wanted confirmation of why they should get the xp boost.
---
Well you are level 10, go back to Adventure Mode. This is exactly why there is Adventure Mode.
---
Pretty sure we'll never see a public beta from Bethesda again :P
---
I prefer it the way Blizzard did with Overwatch.
---
Rigorous internal testing, then a closed beta by people who actually test games for a living, and then finally a public "beta" that only really served as a means of stress testing the servers.
---
Launch was so hassle free it was almost boring lol
---
It has its place still, just very real wasteland adventures
---
I feel you. Level 260 here and it is absolutely insane how the game discourages you from leveling.
---
The game sucked, maybe it’s better now. Don’t discount that criticism, cause almost all of it was 100% warranted.
---
he's talking about the new bounty system, where the victim spends their money to add a bounty to another player. That money is taken from the victim's wallet, not the person who has the bounty placed on them
---
Indeed, blackpowder would be high risk highreward dmg
---
I have seen a bunch off post like that.  I saw someone asking for the updates times to be change becuase and i quote " i want to play when i wake up  without waiting for the update". this me me me me children need to stop. 
---
they should be glad that they even listen to our feedback at all and working on the stuff we as a community bring up to light. 
---
Based on their previous BETA's they don't change anything at all at release.  Cop a tremendous amount of flak and THEN change or make fixes once it is too late.
---
No, they don't. That'd mean a full set isn't necessary. They calculate it individually based on the previous percentage.
---
I think it goes something like -15% x 5 = -75% and then -8% x 5 = -40%. So the incoming damage reduces first by 75% to 25% and then that damage reduces by 40% to 60% being total of 15%. So if you shoot with 100 dmg weapon it deals 15 dmg but then the armors damage resistance kicks in and reduces that even further. Also there is multiple perks so avoid damage.
---
850? Jesus christ 
---
No build zone size increase 
---
welcome and hae fun, what system are you plaing in?
---
Wow, it's almost as if they offer descriptions in-game...
---
Yea well getting killed half way across the map by a level 200, when you’re level 5 with a pipe pistol that has two mags and a 10mm pistol with half that, you let me know how well your odds are in that gunfight. Because, that shit is SUPER ANNOYING. It would be one thing, if it was a more level playing field. Everyone has to make a fresh character. Woulda been the smart thing to do. 
---
There is not
---
YES, muahahahahahahahaha
---
Tnx, I kinda guessed it, but had to ask anyway... 
---
That is why I have a switch at my mic.  
---
I still get a mini heart-attack when my mic symbol flashes up despite having it turned off.  
---
-You should plan with an hour at least. Just to be sure.
---
-There are some workbenches here and there.
---
-Outside. The robots should not respawn, but i am not sure.
---
-Not "Puzzles" but things like "Repair this within a time limit", "Destroy x of this" and "Protect this" kind of things.
---
Crack the nuke Code before you enter, though.
---
Sniper with a faster gun, then. Legendary handmade, or maybe lever action. Get in a handful of mid to high damage shots in the time it takes to get a ridiculously high damage shot and reload with the black powder rifle or dragon (or less), still at long range. Your build is still useful.
---

ansvering 
---
\- It will take around 7-30minutes  (7minutes with bugging throught wall)
---
\- there is part where are work benches, so yes
---
\- you respawn outside every time you die
---
\- search for website nukacrypt or how it is called. There are solved codes so you only need Nuke keycard and you are ready to go.
---
Have fun nuking appalachia.
---
20% xp buff too 👀
---
Imagine how interesting launch day would have been if they did though? 100% even playing field. You’d see some interesting faction esque battles 👀
---
That fusion generator will attract things that will destroy it.
---
Nah, just the same spawn killing people are already so in right now. 
---
Found this while looking into mutations. I was curious about the carnivore one (pretty new player so reading and watching stuff other than playing.  So interesting to see some opinions. What mutation did you guys end up going with?
---
I like it, not large and incongruous, blends into the area nicely.
---
Thanks for sharing your great work!  
---
For inside locations, can you specify if we need to enter the buildings, or if the Legendaries are around them? Or it's always inside?
---
Thanks! Sounds doable!
---
Probably, I for some reason genuinely figured “the fallout community probably won’t resort to spawn camping” 
---
I actually figured we’d see more..role playing ala Rust. Since this is a pseudo rust lite in some aspects.
---
That’s what I mostly disappointed with this mode is what the majority of the community decided to do with it, not so much the current survival meta. 
---
Thanks. How hard is it, say, compared to the robot situation at the end of Mayor for a day quest?
---
Sneaking seems to hide players at least as far as I can tell. But if they have a bounty they still showed up... I think 🤔 
---
Jokes on you I can still hit over 2000 with the right aid and chems 😂👌🏻
---
Nice 👍 
---
I’m ok with that option I don’t care who I am killing as long as im not being forced to start again from scratch to play survival like many casual players are suggesting if bethesda can create separate survival servers for different levels im open to that... the problem is that wont solve the problem because really high teir pvp guys have characters that are lvl 50-70 as low level as possible but still reaching peak strength to minimise caps loss but these characters are geared with high tier weapons so you could in theory have a server for lvl 50-40 30-20 10-1 and anyone over 50 gets paired for this to work.
---
It can't stay like that, it need to be nerfed at least in pvp, i saw a vid of soleone taking multiple mini nukes at once while being sprayed down by tse combat shotgun, he just had to put a super stim and vats os people
---
You must hate Legos
---
Because no fast travel, potentially interesting PVP once the community stops being overtly toxic. XP boost. 
---
Fallout :RUST except not balanced. 
---
That's how it has worked on earlier Legendary challenges, they need to have stars.
---
I thought that the Top 3 Players (gold silver bronze) are always shown on the map?
---
If not then are all 3 players all the time crouching while playing?
---
Depends on your build. Mr. gusties have crazy damage and   
---
 46lvl assaultrons can be anoying too. I tried to do it only with non-legendary hunting rifle and hazmat suit and it was like super hard. In power armor, with decent weapon you will be ok.
---
There is a potentually terrible and game-breaking consequence of disallowing people shoot lower levels. Its that they too can take leaderboard position. Pacifist also seems to work on survival server sometimes, which is ridiculous.
---
I think pacifist on survival should make your character ignore leaderboards, don't ever make the exping level 7 displayed on map, and dont make the leaderboard position unreasonably locked by the guy who lives only because fast travel to him costs more than the reward.
---
I think if anything is wrong it’s the names they chose. Adventure should be called survival, and survival should be called Warzone... 
---
I don’t think they made survival for new players. They made it for anyone past level 50. After all, you can’t be any more powerful after level 50. 
---
Cost of materials + tip. Usually about 500-1000 caps depending on which flux is required.
---
Genuinely the most intelligent point made on the subject matter that I’ve seen all day long. 
---
There are lots of people that asked for a survival mode. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean that everybody else thinks the same.   
---
I really enjoy the survival experience, the only thing that bothers me is the current implementation of the leaderbord and the fact that it marks you on the map if you're in the top 3.  
---
Only people that have a bounty on their head or have a killstreak should be marked but aside from that the new mode is great! :)  
---
You got BoS backwards, BoS Shielded is +2 STR and +3 END.
---
I have a selection of explosive shotties and a decent build. Not bloodied, though. I can kill gutsies and assaultrons ofc, but sometimes if they swarm or get the jump on me I'm in trouble. 
---
They may be sneak mode players then others will probably know for sure.
---
You talk about the real helmet or the swimsuit one
---
This Base is insane! Now i'm gonna rebuild mine! Great work! 
---
 "Scorched Earth — Guaranteed 3\* Lvl 95 Scorchbeast Queen, (1) — Location: Fissure Site Prime after it has been nuked."  
---
Nope.
---
Scorched Earth - Guaranteed  2 legendaries on the Queen, 1x 3\* about 50% of the time, 1x1\* or 1x2\* (+ 1 guaranteed 3 stars high level monster during the fight)  
---
Then you are gtg. Have fun.
---
You come not ready to where people have been preparing for months and you are surprised its hard, lol. Being honest the very same thing would happen if they started fresh, but instead of godlike gangs hunting each other and stomping on randoms, we'd have level 20 gangs denying you possibility of learning the first FT location besides V76
---
sorry i’ve used all my recipes 
---
Thanks mate!
---
Get fucked, prepare to die.
---
True 
---
i was not allowed to use my xbox in the week so i missed out on them
---
Oh, I'm sure it will, but that IS what this mode is about.  
---
I would like to see players pvping with no legendarys items
---
Well done, you levelled up IRL. Take an INT point and the perk card "See Through Bullshit" rank 1 :)
---
Perks like that are for regular armor builds. Also just because you have a perk does not mean you need to keep it on constantly. Lead belly for example does not help you unless you're eating or drinking. The same applies here.
---
Might have been me, I did make that suggestion, heh.  I think that would be a lot of fun.  
---
Sweet lvl 20 shotgun! Great for alt lvlling 
---
PS: It takes a special kind of nerd to fight gutsies and assaultrons in hazmat and non lego hunting rifle. Kudos! :-D
---
To be completely honest there was a lot of hate and most of it was deserved even if it wasn’t constructive. 
---
Jealous much or you just have no writing skills, just move on and let the guy enjoy his silver.
---
Yeah the way we used to test games in the days of PS2/ PS3 was a closed group, selected from applicants. We got a lot of games to test and if you didn't pull your weight you got dropped. The result: less bugs, more polished gameplay. FO76 by all standards only really just came out of beta a couple of months ago.
---
Well, it's the internet, SOME people will complain about literally anything that happens to anything, anywhere for any reason.    
---
I think the complaining would be much much lower with only one uber rare item, and I think a ton of people would be ok even without getting it because it gives you that one cool thing to look forward to that you don't expect to get, and if you ever do get it, then it would be really awesome.  All along you are getting other rare stuff that also feels rare, so the sting would be much lessened.    
---
They should have level locked it to lvl 50, saw a lvl188 last night murder everyone under 70
---
I assume you mean for the survival mode.
---
For bloodied to work, they have to have low life which means that they are very vulnerable in the survival mode and can be easily 1 shot killed.
---
Go with a weightless sneak set and hang around watoga. Lots of places to hide and the protectrons, Mr Handy and Assaultrons are a good alarm to where players are.
---
I could only downvote you once sorry, you really deserve more, but hey, limitations of the reddit platform.
---
Well whoever told you that was misinformed. And now you are too.
---
There’s is a roadmap on Bethesda’s website that you can find and it will give you all the info you need. Easy!
---
You could open the keyring in 3 and nv
---
That is fab! Love it 💜💜
---
Yeah shared stashes would be nice when your leveling a new character
---
Post is literally titled **account** transfer banks
---
I don’t know I’m almost level 200 and have had level 50s take me out. 
---
I think it works with a weapon class: explosives rather than an explosive effect
---
I made a pulpit by placing a dresser with its back toward the audience. It’ll do until we get a real pulpit.
---
They weren’t working for me either. I was first too but nobody either could see/was interested. I had to go to Whitesprings just to find anyone. Sniped in shot order, of course. 
---
I don't understand that decision either. They should have at least implemented a level cap so that only characters at, for example, level 1 to 50 or even lower can transfer over to survival.
---
But know the damage is done isn't it? My knowledge on this topic is limited but I don't think they can just undo that.
---
Nope. I live under the same bridge.
---
I would love too! I have a really squeaky voice for a 19 year old though. I’ve been looking to do this quest ever since I got it but never had the chance to. 
---
I’ll add you later if you don’t mind or if you didn’t find a group already
---
That did the trick, thank you
---
Yee still strange. I thought that these markers were permanent? 
---
Kinda broken If crouching does the trick. So Im Number 1 crouch in my well hindden camp and wait to Profit? ...
---
when are they going to fix the bug where no trade option appears when trading with other players..and the bug where you cant view the stats on vendor items anymore and the bug where you spawn into an area and are killed by invisible unkillable enemies. and the bug where i never spawn on my welcome mat but spawn outside my camp under water. i could go on lol..but i still love the game
---
Well the next update brings player shops and then in may we'll get the legendary shop.
---
These 2 updates will clear a lot of space in my inventory. 
---
Collecting named or rare items will always be profitable since someone will always be willing to pay a lot of money for that junk. It's the main reason why i did the parade. In a few months i'll be able to sell those masks for an obscene amount of caps.
---
Dude, that’s where the action is. What you’re worried about not losing your caps? Lol play adventure. 
---
And then the players that do get good legendary weapons rolls and such, will be catapulted far into the lead over those that don’t, and we are right where we are now except that it would be harder to get legendaries for yourself. Right now you can swap into adventure, get a legendary of your own, swap back into survival and be on even ground with the farm campers. 
---
I keep seeing people say “pvp server” and “this is what a pvp server should be like”
---
And well, sure. Expect it’s not just a PVP server. Survival mode has less pvp restrictions, but it’s not supposed to be the only thing that people do.
---
It’s survival mode. Not pvp mode. There is a difference. 
---
I already knew that but this game reinforced it in me. YouTube and social media is full of brain-dead lemmings. 
---
I had to stand in the top left corner for it to go off. It is the main county cemetery, there isn't a separate one
---
the traveling bot i found was by the tracks north of Charleston station.
---
it died while i was checking its inventory (odd)but it definitely had it for like 940 caps.
---
bot had a pack Brahmin and eyebot guard
---
This honestly screwed me over I started a new character was level 5 managed to get to the top (2 hours) and every man and his dog started hunting me.  And since it was a new character no train stations unlocked I was smart enough to put down my call in a off location though so didn't get vault 76 sniped.
---
Once you get to the top your gameplay goes out the window and is just avoid getting killed no point collecting anything as the team of people killing you will just get it
---
I doubt this very much
---
But we have say 4 uber rare items now and handful of rare masks, then a handful of common masks. 
---
I just don't see a reason to complain at all.
---
How did you build it, I would be interested to see what you did .. since they patched the foundations.
---
That's... just....  
---
Thanks for THAT share!
---
I want the tactical helmet. the one that goes with the wetsuit
---
i love your idea, but I have just one suggestion make the robot look like Liberty Prime
---
You wasted more time writing this than he did reporting you. 
---
Don’t worry about it, nothing will happen just because you get reported a handful of times.
---
Pump shotgun skin isn't working? Xbox 
---
We wouldnt be right where we are now because as it stands every other person has an OP weapon and armour set where as tge other way they would be limited to a few per server
---
Very useful, thanks buddy
---
I built in a cave with foundations blocking the way in
---
Survival mode was just a lure for all the tryhards, it’s good that they’re gone from adventure mode now
---
I went heavy weapons and mellee, strengh has all the weight reduction perks in though so most strengh is on them, but it allows me to carry a huge arsenal of weapons
---
Nice, which cave ? I thought about that as well, but most camps didn't look like they could be blocked.
---
The one just west of vault 76, so its in the no nuke zone too
---
exactly :)
---
There still needs to be a way to counter turret platforms built at the Whitesprings, in either mode.
---
Are you even tried to read my post? I say **no single word** about nerfs or "too rough or cheaters.
---
Even for a non grinder or server hopper this is very helpful information, thanks :)
---
I'm having issues with pump shotgun skin Xbox not sure if other are encountering?
---
Nice 
---
Unless they crouch or use stealth boy, in which case you can't use VATS.
---
It has to be starred legenedaries I believe.
---
Read post before commenting
---
Lead champagne is pretty neat imo. Think its buff is +100 rad resist and increases fall speed. Also red ant lauger gives +50 carry weight for 1 minute, so its a nice buff if you're just finishing raiding and dont want to drop stuff.
---
&gt; "Scorched Earth — Guaranteed 3\* Lvl 95 Scorchbeast Queen, (1) — Location: Fissure Site Prime after it has been nuked."  
---
Nope. 
---
Yup, It really is guaranteed a 3\* Level 95 Scorchbeast, this post does not make comment on what loot any of them drops. 
---
Totally I and my wife where expecting to have to create new characters for this experience not continue it just adventure with rank mode.
---
Don't think it's crouching, I think you have to live for a certain amount of time before it shows up on map.
---
You're looking for Demolition in the Intelligence perk. 
---
At level 15 with the lowest level of raider PA and standard gear its f hard. 
---
Even at a proper level if your using ranged, have a tonne of ammo. Think of a number and double that, the robots have high DR.
---
Personally, the people are what made it bad. From the guy sitting on a house constantly sniping you. Yes, slap damage, but still annoying to be getting hit constantly with some kind of exploding gun or to the guy that just kept throwing plasma grenades the entire time; right in the middle of the pack.  Or the people who followed the group and constantly ran around meleeing you when you’re engaged with enemies. No it wasn’t all that fun. 
---
Alright Hannibal, calm down. 
---
Elegant in its simplicity. 
---
System?
---
Its a slower alternative to a Blackops free for all festival of death.
---
Oh yea my bad, ps4
---
How many caps have you spent on armor and weapons? If you farmed all of them, how long did that take? I'm not saying I have the answer to how to balance pvp but I can tell you that dropping weapons is not it.
---
I try not to go below 5k shotgun shells on my character. And I carry 5 shotties at all times and can bring three max level explosive shotguns at 200%. That just better be enough...?
---
I’ve been testing some things and I believe you have to do 100% of the damage. If a teammate helps it doesn’t count for either player.
---
Evan is just a regular scorched enemy.
---
Trust me, there was a glitch before that if 1 player killed him, you'd have yo server hop and hope he wasn't dead there too.
---
If I came across the vendor they’re planning at you camp, I’d buy several or many depending on how their priced. It’s a fun effect. That’s just me tho, I feel other people aren’t as trivial with their caps as I am. Sitting at 0 right now after survival. 
---
Sell you useless weapons, save up 25kcaps.....head to the market and buy what you want
---
No idea as I don't use legendaries, just standard equipment that chows through ammo.
---
Great! I especially like the stone wall from the bridge used in the room. 
---
It was stupid of Bethesda to allow existing characters with god tier equipment into this mode ,the people that are saying it makes no difference because every new player will have to play catch up are the ones who are fully decked out in god tier gear (that was probably duped) who enjoy slapping the average joes around.               equally stupid was removing the up to level 5 new player protection so that new characters get ganked straight out of the vault.....yeah pass on your "survival mode"Bethesda
---
My chars live in dense armor, did not make a difference at all.
---
I’ve only seen two legendaries since the start of survival, I don’t do much solo exploring, and only the one with starred counted. 
---
I’m just saying this is because it’s what I have heard from other players.
---
I’m pretty sure knowing this game what you said is correct based on judging who gets it and who doesn’t.
---
Im at 1 hour at this moment. And so do the other top placed and cant seem to see anyone. And I do believe they cant see me either since I didnt get attack in all this time (was doing workshops and PvE stuff)
---
I killed too wanted low level characters and left a present. Indeed it's a mercy killing 
---
ASMR? 
---
Yeah me neither, but trust me they are worthless in the most cases 
---
Only reason I bought it :(
---
They'll be at less of a disadvantage if they aren't going up against people in full assassin sentinel gear with bloodied explosive and 2se guns from all the rampant duping early in the game bro
---
No clue. Did AWOL with a team and both of us tagged two 3*s, but only I got the points.
---
Went to West Tek. Both tagged Super Mutants but only teammate awarded 2 points.
---
Solo’d Alpha Wolf and was awarded three points.

Why not? This should be the challenge, to hide and survive, and how can you hide and survive if you are MARKED on the map?
---
So, the otherones like energy res is also usles in PA? 
---
It used to. But then they buffed heavy weapons and it now isn't as effective as it used to be.
---
Exactly my experience as well, its a great game. Haters gonna hate, but I ignore them now. 
---
I actually stuck on the west to middle part of the map until i was 50. It's not that hard to level up to level 50 in this game. I'm just saying you dont need to be level 10 and running around in the watoga region, leeching like a lot of players do.
---
Yeah what the hell
---
I didn't know that at the time.
---
But that still doesn't explain my problem.  NPC's randomly dieing around me (no it's not other people sniping things).  I was trying to take a picture next to Murgle the Cat, when he just...fell over dead into his food bowl...
---
Ugh, have they still not fixed Evan? 
---
It's not useless but the point of power armor is to put points into other things. Also get the grounded mutation and that should solve the problem of energy resist
---
I think the whole automatic guns spectre (excluding laser/gamma) weapons got buffed. In January I barely scratched the enemies. Now I've slain 3 scorchbeasts in two minutes, because their health was bouncing back. The only downside is that I am constantly scrounging for 5.56/lead.
---
How much do you want for 2k .45 ?
---
Tnx for the advice man! 
---
I did a uranium fever and mirelurke horde event (that just so happened to spawn 2 legendaries) solo. That got me up to 5.
---
I did another uranium fever and one violent night where I tagged every legendary, but didn't get any "kill" and out of those 4 legendaries 1 of them counted.
---
Something's wonky with it registering when you're just tagging.
---
Yes, that's the Camp I was talking about, I found it in the comments to one of the other posts.. it's the best I've seen! Inspirational. This is coming from someone who is pretty much homeless in Fo76, just haven't gotten into base building, but you're making me reconsider. :)
---
Cool thanks, if you ever post pics or a video, if you could send it to me. I had some people asking how they can build a bunker post patch.
---
I'm speechless. This is the best build I've seen thus far. How did you even visualize this to begin with.
---
This is awesome...
---
It’s not that high levels shouldn’t be able to play with low levels. The RPG elements are at war with the survival elements, especially in PvP survival mode. The gap needs closing between the god tier and noob tier loot so everybody has a chance. In PvP all weapons should stand a chance.
---
That's for charisma 
---
&gt;  Then I turned around to have a clown with a machete kill me and eat my body. 
---
Pennywise, ist that you?
---
Do you have the Plague Walker mutation and walking around with a bunch of diseases?
---
Some fellow players have reported that it can have... 'funny' interactions with even neutral NPCs.
---
Whenever you get a message the X killed Y, you open your map and look for a dropped loot bag. Top three players get hidden from view if crouched
---
I can only imagine! I might have damn near fainted if it was my state, Haha:D
---
I just had this bug but with caps. Had 0 and completed an event and said I had at least 21000, numbers got cut off. 
---
I was so upset they were playing with me like that. 
---
Proud of you, Volcarian21 &lt;3
---
Holy crap that is amazing. I love the whole feel inside your main living area and the workshop. It looks nice and cluttered without feeling cramped.
---
You're playing a product that the rest of us tested for the past 4 months. Of course its not as shit as it was on release. Many of the bugs from launch are still around, they just aren't the game breaking ones.
---
Fucking Techncial Data for fucks sake. How fucking long does fixing a spelling mistake take?
---
I have full weightless + weight reduction marine, 0 weight with chameleon is amazing, any weapon choices? 
---
How much are you willing to pay?
---
I was in the Morgantown area the other night and I noticed a quest about attending a frat party and then I realised it was part of the new alcohol brewing mechanics. I got to the point where I was given the vintage nukashine by Biv and I drank it, I kinda knew what was going to happen, I ended up near the "Top of the World" I was only level 7. 
---
Luckily I have been on this sub long enough to know what was going to happen. 
---
What the fuck is the point of leaderboards? Hey look at how long I lived for! Hey look at how much exp I gained!!!
---
Fucking what? 
---
Yep save up caps and buy the stuff you need from someone, i have been grinding for legendaries for months and the best weapon i found was a furious minigun which gave me a nice amount of caps. 
---
The problem with this is that, irritating as these are, someone, somewhere, out of carelesness/lag spike/distraction/whatever is going to delete something irreplaceable and quest breaking and then we will have 'why oh why Bethesda you allow for this to happen?'.
---
Its seriously like that? Haven't check myself but what you said sounds like my first real-money Atom transaction.
---
It sounds like you were expecting a lobby of noobs, rolled a fresh character and expected to faceroll, and instead got your shit pushed in.
---
lel
---
I strongly agree with that. I have created new character just for a purpose of more realistic post apocalyptic survival game, so barely any bullets in my backpack, lvl 5, barely any armour on me. What I could do against high lvl player at this point? Obviously low lvls will have longer life span so obviously they will be showing on map very often. Whats the point of that? 
---
The event itself SUCKED ASS. What people liked was the cosmetic rewards and group activities.
---
The event itself was just a 15 minute long afk timer. The flavor around it is what people liked, not going afk waiting for level 10 enemies.
---
That could have more sense. Still I would prefer not to have any markers apart from bounties.
---
Agreed.
---
... 
---
Survival  mode IS PVP mode. The whole patch was dedicated to PVP rule adjustment and balance. You literally get branded with flashinh green circle on map telling people to come kill you.
---
If your going bloodied you need Bolstering armor. Then you can't be one shot. It's my current build and with a 20 killing in 1 life, the statistics speak for themselves. Even against Sentinel Assassins build. 
---
Pshhhhh I got cappies. It's like there's magnets in my pockets or something. They fly out of ppls pockets and into mine.... Idk what kind of perk I have on but I truly appreciate all your caps. 
---
Just by the game design yesterday someone big and angry was 3 levels 5-6 players in lowbie area including myself lol. Freshly started character.
---
This is literally survival, the strong survive, the weak bitch on reddit
---
What system?
---
You go into your pip boy and reject the event
---
Definitely on board here u/pheakelmatters. West Tek is pretty weak for legendaries - occasional single \*\*-\*\*\* is what I see - I've never had a legendary at Defiance, and RobCo I've only ever seen the single legendary Mr. Gutsy except for the very very very first time I did the AWOL event. Level 207 with nearly 500 hours here.
---
What? He’s in no way edgy, he’s emo if anything and he’s hardly a rapper. He makes a variation of emo pop.
---
Wait until they adjust invulnerability buff.devs probably forgot that 99% of players arent running supercomputers that lload map in 2 seconds. 
---
They could tier the instances ala dark souls or division
---
Click clack pow! 
---
Awesome, when you do big builds like this it’s time you miss those spawn mats that fallout 4 had hate how you spawn 100 ft away then have to run up 3 floors, really miss those. Very nice build 
---
Bruh, I'd log on but I never seemed to see the event open for me. I got to play it twice. Wah wahh. After about two hours of play and no event, it's shut up t off cuz there wasn't shit else to do. Finally there's survival which I'm stupid happy about
---
They fear you so much that they commit suicide. It's better than dying by your hands.
---
You can always ask around to see if another player has something you want.
---
Yeah ill get a quick video of it after work, its not pretty, but i think its funtional
---
Not going bloodied my friend :)
---
If you're talking about finding them I picked up bos combat leg plan yesterday. 
---
Now with slap damage at 0 and the coming update that will also eliminate CAMP damage, these players that wanted unfair PVP to roleplay as a "raider" are going to disappear.
---
Let's be honest, a lot of them didn't want PVP.  They only wanted a way to kill other people and destroy their shit free of consequences.
---
Now that this certain subset of players have to fight on the terms of people that *actually* wanted full out, unmitigated PVP, they are crying it's unfair.
---
And stagger perks
---
IDK I had no problem killing him. There was another dead Evan on the floor but mine was alive and well, waiting for the sweet sweet release of death by my hand.
---
We found we kind of like the new survival mode, I recently came back to the game with my group, we always hang around in 4, we wanted to give this mdoe a shot.
---
Here were our overall considerations and observations:
---
* Being in a team makes you stronger, but it doesn't mean it makes you the winner as well.
---
* Having camps on keypoints around the map is a great way to move. Just placing the camp and hide it somehow is ridiculously great form a tactical point of view in this mode.
---
* We don't carry with us tons of items but just weapons and armours (and ammos if ranged), we know where to gather stuff, where most workbenches are for emergency repairs, where food and drinks can be found, we got most recipes, we basically prepared our characters and knowledge just for this, so we can move freely. 
---
* The mode itself gives that fresh, but small, portion of fear you usually get to grow when playing survival games the first times, but it's still on low tier as you don't actually lose anything beside caps, some healing stuff and materials, all things you can easily get on the game world. We wish they release full drop of inventory.
---
Nope, no mutations and no diseases.
---
Customer_support requests customer support. This recursive story deserve to be on top
---
Guess not, or my problem is related but different.  I got credit for "killing" Evan with my "Todd Howard Mind God Rays" or something...
---
Sorry and the duped stimpaks 
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/recklessdovah/video/71989494
---
instagating lever action is my choice for NPCs
---
dragon for PVP
---
Absolutely, and I chose not to play lol. 
---
This is what I’m talking about. I never once said I had a problem with pvp, or less restrictions on pvp. Just that it doesn’t make sense to port the entire game over if all people are gonna do is pvp wars at train stations. Just make a battle arena for that.
---
The idea that survival is meant ONLY for pvp is just wrong. The 20% bonus exp? Why is that in survival if it’s just meant for quick pvp bursts. 
---
&gt; Personally, I would love to see TSE get scrapped from the game
---
And that's my problem with a game with PVE and PVP.
---
The people that PVP want things completely removed, affecting PVE.
---
Why should I lose my TSE just because some dickbags are killing other players with the same gun?
---
Dude the first 20 hours is a guaramteed blast, it can even last for a whole lot longer with friends but after a while it’s just really boring not like other MMOs where the endgame is when the fun begins
---
The new stuff they have added its nice. At last i see few items I really want to buy.
---
I don't know if you ever played online survivals with open pvp, but who enters these modes should stamp on their head that they are by their own and they can't expect anything from anyone. This makes every pc literally hostile to you.
---
I would not consider it pvp-only mode though, there is still pve stuff to do, and a big portion of the game is pve even in this new mode, they just lifted some restriction and changes some rules from the previous mode.
---
But people tend to forget what "survival" means. You survive or die, plain and easy as this.
---
It also just doesn't feel rewarding or enjoyable as a mechanic. It was novel for a few times, bunkering down in anticipation, but the same gameplay loop can be achieved with the new bounty system, so I don't understand why they're treating it like a battle royale instead of survival. Why punish surviving, seemingly arbitrarily, and with no reward for killing that person, or for surviving, outside of "bragging rights."
---
 I truly feel like the wording on the load page right before entering survival is phrased as just "top 3" for a reason, and that Bethesda is aware that it might be more of a deterrent than a draw. It leaves them felxibility to change it to whatever leaderboard they want. Possibly even the top option when you open the full leader board? Call it cautious optimism. This is just so close to perfection, with this one mechanic making no sense to me.
---
1) Dodge 
---
2) Duck 
---
3) Dip 
---
4) Dive 
---
5) Dodge. 
---
&gt;Smoke grenades
---
This is already a thing. Creatable phantom device, from Mistress of Mysteries questline.
---
Yea
---
I would love this to be in the game since i five characters its a total nightmare having to use other players to trade items between characters especially since my IRL friend doesn't play anymore 
---
I am very cool with the high stakes tension. But it’s not organic feeling at all. It’s just people camping at spawns waiting for a war. I have no problem with dying and being killed.
---
Oh I'd love a full loot version of the game but it'd have to be no-legendary only game mode, or the loot chances for godroll being three hundred times higher.
---
What you said about controlling the map via camp location is crucial.
---
Being in team makes you stronger only in such regards that when I've been running away from the melee guy I've been shot down by the sneak one, when I was searching for the sneaky bastard I was staggered by his teammates until dropped dead, and when I was not in a disadvantageous position, I had no line of sight to them.
---
It’s such a shame that’s all this game has become,  also at lvl 100+.
---
Until I found out about Whitesprings I was also struggling with lvl up. Take some trips there. 
---
I got the game a couple of months after it came out, and I definitely experienced game-breaking bugs, most often—and frustratingly—being disconnected from the server seemingly at random.  I never bothered to do events or daily quests because I had no hope of completing one before losing connection.
---
Based on the patch notes, though, it seems like they’ve beefed up their servers and cracked down on bug exploits, making it so players are less able to overwhelm the servers with ridiculous inventories.
---
So then the only issue is with content.  If you’re the sort of Fallout fan that would see things like the presence of an organization that was still largely unknown and relegated to a single military outpost in south-central California 80 years after the bombs fell in West Virginia, 25 years after the war—and would be annoyed by the lip-service explanation for how that would happen—than you’ll be annoyed by Fallout 76.  If you’re the kind of player who doesn’t like suddenly having your ass handed to you because the game tries to scale to the highest player in a given spawn radius and some level 100+ guy is passing through your area to do some event or get to a merchant while you’re still a level 30...then you’ll probably be annoyed by Fallout 76.  If you’re the kind of person who likes to wander through the map, enjoying the world-building, piecing together stories (hidden and not) of people who lived and died through the war, then you’ll probably really enjoy the game...up until you come across some other player who wants to troll you, breaks the immersion, or has a hot mic and talks to himself.  *Then*, you’d probably have a problem.  I mean, I’m trying to listen to this holotape of a woman trying to cope with locking herself in a closet and listening to monsters killing what few people she has left in the world, then dealing with starvation and thirst as the days go by and she can still hear them shambling around outside the door; the last thing I need is to hear some shit-heel’s running commentary of not being able to find what he’s looking for, wondering if there’s any booze in that bar, and—oh, shit—that vertibird must have crashed through the roof, I gotta take a picture of that!
---
...but I digress.
---
I'm sporting a character that is all about movement and breaking line of sight and its only applicable when the enemy team doesn't have the positional advantage. If they do, you need to find a different attack vector.
---
Have you ever followed a quest?
---
Au revoir Carnaval! See you next year.
---
Why did you spawned ten times on location you knew is contested?
---
The money is spent by the victim to place the bounty.  A fee.  But the actual reward is still paid by the wanted player when it occurs some random amount of time later.  
---
Turrets suck up VATS locks, dead or alive. Just build the cheapest one and use it as a VATS shield
---
I'm up for loot stealing from stash, should make all stashes with no property, also remove the function to use the camp as stash, limit its storage or just make it like any other stash you can loot, if they ever want to do this.
---
Random spawn within region/area, yes. We went to huntdown people costantly spawning in vault 76 or watoga, after dozens of kill it wasn't even fun anymore.
---
Where did you get them? 
---
No Ahmed, Jamal, Carlos, or Shiniqua? Historically accurate.
---
Great to see someone who can objectively review something for a change. 
---
Not tried survival yet and don't think I will for a while as PVP is the part I dislike the most 
---
I haven't really been tuned in to news for this game for a while. Did any of the vault "raids" get added in yet?
---
Same, I've loaded up 3 different mules with aid and junk already. This is truly a time of bounty.
---
To see how many times they wanted to spawn kill a level 8.
---
completing several quests, joining and completing events, clearing areas of their npcs....  
---
May I suggest you, if you just want to level up, one of the most classic ways to level up in rpg games: kill whatever moves that gives exp. I suggest supermutants (great exp-loot ratio, but might be difficult), ghouls/scorched, fast kills for mid exp, or those miner molerats (like supermutants).
---
I'm lvl 151 exactly and using All Rise since lvl 50. :D
---
Just found 2\* Instigating with +25% faster RoF. Haven't yet tried it out as I only have 2k of ammo for this.
---
Been playing mainly PA heavy weapon build with my trusted .50cal and gatling gun. After the patch they are insane and fun.
---
Lots of people play it stupid and I hope they will read that and cease doing so.
---
You sir are a true survivor. 
---
He has an armor mod and 2 ranks into a perk. It’s not build specific. All my PvP builds run these two things
---
You’re relying on the fat man and an explosive shotgun at a range where the shotgun isn’t doing any ballistic damage. He doesn’t even need sentinel. He just needs to run a dense mod and 2 ranks of fireproof. These two things are mandatory for PvP.
---
Yeh I know how to do that, I have the overseers quest line and come across different ones as I explore. I'm more of a wanderer, than going in a straight line to each quest "hub". Plus until I get to about level 15 I won't be leaving the Forest.
---
Just looking for a way to more efficiently use my limited playtime. 
---
Looks great!
---
Can confirm, this raider is having a wonderful time. I've loaded 2 characters up to max caps and 3 mules with aid and junk. This is truly a bountiful time. 
---
I did.
---
Where is Whitesprings on the map? I know everyone talks about it, but I haven't ever been there, so don't know where it is. 
---
!remindme 3 days
---
Crouching is not standing and not moving. Crouching disables sentinel
---
&gt; The 20% bonus exp? Why is that in survival if it’s just meant for quick pvp bursts.
---
Just to lure people into the new mode.  Same as the special weekly challenges.
---
It’s to entice people into PVP.   Ones that may normally not be interested in it. 
---
we felt out of place, not that much but it was a different feel, me and my team, we always played open pvp survivals like conan exiles, ark, rust, minecraft, etc.. but fallout 76 felt really chill, i'm not sure if it is a positive or negative thing for everyone as each player has his own, we can call it, likings. For us it was too easy, not challenging, and still has room, lots of room, for changes.
---
We had a chance to find someone with a really nice gear and build, he managed to take down two of us before our mawler ohk him with a hammer swing, then he respawned in fo 76 where i was already waiting, we split on spawnpoints, i tihnk we killed him 7 or 8 times? he then left server. This should not be allowed.

I imagine this one running around survival in his bright yellow excavator power armor. Just asking to get ganked.
---
During the event if you have the mask you can be killed without initiating first. It's basically a who can have the mask the longest event
---
You receive Experience Points for nearly everything: try building out your Camp, plant corn and other food and harvest, loot weapons and dismantle them in your camp- you get xp for everything 
---
In the data mines there were a couple skins coming out, one silver and 1 gold. The silver 1 looks pretty boss
---
How do you deal with the horrid FPS, hitching and regular CDT's? I have tried to like this game as you have but I just can't play it.
---
Are you on PC ? i have a spare Super Sledge for free. PM your ign.
---
I’m planning to start a new character to try out survival mode too (even though I’m not interested in pvp but the thrill of surviving sounds rather interesting =p) and it was enjoyable reading your experiences, thanks for sharing! (Did you manage to get away from the PA dude in the video?)
---
I would seriously love something where I'm just wearing a  Giant birthday cake
---
Hmmm... When was the last time you took a shower? What about a fresh change of clothes, any of that recently?
---
Your just early for next year's Fasnacht
---
Can...can Todd Howard demote himself?
---
If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball :D
---
The best way is to make it. Invest in the ammosmith perks and kill super mutants for gun powder. Go on junk runs to get steel, aluminum, and lead. Higher level super mutants and scorched will drop it.
---
The best place to kill mobs for it is probably Big Bend Tunnel
---
They don’t need to but they can, and have every right to. Just server hop if you’re not happy instead of excluding players from an area based on their level. That’s idiotic 
---
55.6 is a pain at any level honestly, you might be better off selling stuff to the vendor, saving up some caps, and finding someone who is selling it.
---
You can get some buy destroying turrets
---
Yeah mate, I really wanted to fight that explosive weapon guy and all the rest
---
Well I’ll keep enjoying my bonus exp, and when I inevitably become the longest life, I’ll set up and wait for the angry masses to come for me. 
---
I’m not mad about the pvp focus, I just think it takes away from how cool it can really be if that is the only focus. 
---
2x damage if full health and 50% cripple chance
---
And yes, I thought I was safe when I recorded the clip, but he ended up coming back for a few more circles around the pillar before he left and I ended my game session. I was laughing maniacally the whole time. 
---
That's not a shame, it's a bonus. Legendary weapons are rare and there are a lot of combinations of them. Most of the time these wont fit your build. Being able to trade away weapons that are a fit for someone else for a weapon that fits your build is a bonus.
---
I'm not a pvp build and tried it solo today anyway. Learned there's definitely a team advantage. That was fun!
---
I can get on in 30 min and help u lvl up. 
---
*well-emptied*
---
What made you think it was a good idea to walk around with 51lbs of aid? Did you even read before you joined?
---
My character is a functional alcoholic so I always like to pretend that hes just consistently pissing himself
---
Nice :)
---
Anthem, mass effect andromeda,  and battlefront 2 all come to mind
---
Watago, right?  Yep.
---
The Whitesprings is by far is the fastest. Agro the bots and make an inner and outer circle. You can farm almost unlimited legendaries, CORES, Radaway, Rad X, Steel, Aluminum, springs, screws, and other good stuff. The bots sometimes take time to load their loot table as do legendary ghouls. 
---
You shouldn’t even need to server hop. By the time you do an inner and outer loop someone else will have reset the spawn by coming there.
---
Fuck, sry man I just realized I'm on Xbox... :s
---
Make sure to check the area first and see that no higher level characters have been through it but go to Huntersville in the savage divide. Super mutants in general either yet have melee weapons or automatic rifles which will give you the ammo you need
---
Hahah I was holding my breath when I saw him coming back to find you and you circling the pillar with him, glad to hear you got out safely! 
---
Thanks for the info! Y’all sure have saved me a lot of time and caps!
---
Watoga yes! 
---
The Y2K madness just started spreading...
---
Yes, you are supposed to be able to.  Buuuuutt.... it’s beta, so.....  might be broken.  Anyone?
---
That looks epic
---
Aahahhahah, oh I want that to happen now ;D
---
I did this during beta and even though Evan was still alive for me it warms my heart to know that new vault 76 emigrees are facing the same challenges. 76 Strong!
---
I thought I recognized an old friend but couldn’t place it! Thanks!
---
Also can we get Arc Welders and such from previous games... the lack of Beartrap Gauntlet leaves a beartrap shaped hole in my heart, and I wanna put similar holes in super mutants with said gauntlet 
---
I'm definitely interested in the shotgun
---
No it wasn't. 90% of the criticism was unfounded bullshit. 10% was about the actual bugs. There were quite a few, but the bullshit was legendary.
---
Are you stealth sniping? How is that working for you, in all seriousness? I was considering just trying out Survival but I didn't think my rifleman would stand much of a chance. You're getting reasonable results?
---
does it mark on the map?
---
It can be both.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Whitespring_Resort
---
Lol, first time I went there I was constantly sneaking and using vats to try to find whatever was making that noise.   Then I saw the letters changing....
---
That's honestly bullshit. I considered moving to that bridge just because of the little energy node looking thingy on the east wall. It would totally make sense to build there, and either the server you're on has power already, or you can go do the "powering up thunder mountain" event to get free power. 
---
Where at the station are the campers, any specific spots?
---
Radiation Emitters, Stone Benches, metal Picnic Tables
---
Here is why it's bad, all they have to do is crouch and they're hidden. It's nearly worthless.
---
Unfortunately, yup.
---
Very nice write up. It is a fun game mode for all levels if you appreciate a bit of adrenaline. The win is not always in killing someone else. The win can be in just surviving when you know you are out gunned. 
---
There's a good trick for that - you get about 4 stories above AND below where your camp is initially placed. So if you can plunk that baby on something high up, you got yourself the makings of a mighty fine tower.
---
I think I've got some of them with the Cranberry Bog events. But I'm 100% sure I've got the BOS arms from scrapping.
---
Anyway, that would be an easy way to do it. Tag a long with some high level player. If we were on the same console I would be happy to help. 
---
Oh well that's a surprise, I always thought it was a town in the bottom right corner of the map or something. 
---
I think it is funny as hell that its called flatwoods monster yet we have never killed it at flatwoods or even witnessed it over there. So far I've killed it at the mire, toxic valley, the forest and the savage divide.
---
I'm not playing right now as I am at work. 
---
As a level 9 player he will get his arse whipped so fast doing what you suggest. 
---
As a new player, kill anything you can, complete quests where you can, craft anything you can. All these give xp. The game is not a race
---
Yeah, filthy casual here. I’m probably in the minority of the PVE crowd, but I think it was the right move for you folks.    I’m glad to hear you are having a good time in Survival mode.    😉
---
I was thinking the same thing, it’s been ages since I last got a 3 star leg armor or weapon.
---
Yeah I just want a reliable source you know
---
Where can I find lots of turrets
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
That’s news to me but I’m happy to hear it.
---
I’m gonna channel Morpheus on this one; 
---
“What if somebody told you that Survival Mode was about more than JUST pvp.”
---
Nope, no Vault raids have been added yet. I think they will be added in The Summer Update
---
I think that only the 3 players that killed more people should appear on the map. Yesterday a guy was waiting for me outside a location for about 20 min because I was surviving more than 2 hours
---
Yep, always wrap it with walls.  Since I did, not one attack on it or the walls.
---
You got video of it? I’ve never heard of people getting these mods through scrapping. They seem to be like the deep pocketed mods where you can only learn them through the plans, and I believe some data-mined and proved this. Sometimes you learn the BOS helmet mod through scrapping combat armor tho. 
---
damn  have you tried stuff to fix? contacted bethesda? 
---
&gt; There are millions of honest PVP players out there
---
Yes that's true. But they are not playing fallout 76 sadly.
---
But still helping a lot. Use Dodgy and Serendipity perk and you're set.
---
Kinda blows as my strat was going to be to hole up somewhere with a bunch of food and water and set mines everywhere lol
---
I didn't go there until I was 35 or something... That wasn't so smart, so the sooner the better. Tag some enemies and get xp while all those high lvl kill them. ;) 
---
This would be really helpful because I think it would get rid of a lot of the angst to people are feeling after this event. If you know ahead of time what the odds are it makes it a lot less disappointing when he you don't get it 
---
It's a fun game.  It was fun at launch too, but there were definitely issues.  I still don't think they have balance figured out.  You don't feel particularly powerful at a high level when you're putting an entire magazine of 30 into a Super Mutant and they still don't go down.
---
I have a way to get hundreds of steel and lead in just minutes if you want to know
---
 Dense mod became mandatory during the machine gun screech attacks. 
---
Unfortunately yes
---
Sprinting now consumes less AP. 
---
Tag along with a high lvl would work. ;) 
---
Would be dope ... But as right know (PS4) dont matter what Server Im on. I cant see the Top Players on the Map for some reason. Its kinda stupid. If you want to PvP you'll first need to find targets. But Also I hate the One Shot PvP. I think Im gonna Dump my Power Armor for there is no real reason to use it right now.
---
The camo is **really** good.
---
Umm how?
---
Ouch, you've got a point. That's the helm paint I got from scrapping arms. Editing my post.
---
I saw mention of the purple jacket / white pants ski outfit. Some of these are in the open world some aren't,  right?  I was buying everything,  but I think you can find some without having to buy from him.   He had the spacesuit and the clean spacesuit.   I know the non clean is in the world...
---
So you were the dude who was nerfing the spawns at Hornwright Summer Villa? Jesus, when will these lowbies just learn to stick to the Vault 76 entrance and grind the liberators till they are a respectable level. 
---
it says " reconnaissance of designated location recommended , standby to receive coordinates." " tactical assessment. irreversible.. Situation developing" 
---
One of my alts looks like her brother. He is a middle aged man with male pattern baldness and a jacked up face. 
---
I role play the vault Accountant that is not very good at surviving the Wasteland. 
---
As it's in the forest area, I have no clue why I went there lol
---
Indeed, they should have tested the Survival mode in a beta before they... oh, wait...
---
Go to the eastern penitentiary and collect all of the tin can traps there is 9 of them and 1 tin can = 2 steel and 1 lead so you will be getting 162 steel and 81 lead each run and you can sever hop and do this until you are satisfied with the amount you have
---
I can't understand why Beth thought "let's put level 500 with level 10", but I guess it would have happen after a while anyway.
---
But getting sniped right when you leave the Vault to steal the one stimpak you've received is what prevent me from getting there. 
---
I don't play to get instakill by people with nothing else to do from their days, I play to relax at the end of mine.
---
I don't mind PVP, but I kinda want to do it on a fair ground. Which Fallout 76 is currently unable to bring to the table.
---
Idk, I logged into survival mode for the very first time and just so happened to be whitespring station and some plug shot at me when I was at the trader. I had to pull out my 45 n bussa cap. Then he came back and another time and another time. Thirty seconds into the new mode and someone is already steppin. I'm in love w this mode
---
I have contacted support, and it is an issue that they are aware of and working on
---
Peeps would nuke the top player (remember they are always visible when not broken), every time, with no counter if BGS did as you suggest.  I’m not sure that’s a good idea.
---
Yeah something is definitely wrong with the tracker. Killed 9 legendary mobs, the tracker is stuck at 4....
---
Solo so i did 100% of damage all the time.
---
I think is savage divide... I got scared seeing the first Scorched Beast on my way there so it took a long time til I tried to visit it again. 
---
Overkill IMO.  I’ve done site alpha solo 2x now and got through fairly easily with 1 TSE Shotgun and 1 TSE lever action.  My problem is I always seems to get lost down there and takes a lot longer that it should.  
---
The Letter Scrolls VI : Watoga announced!
---
I had over 3000 Atom saved up from doing in-game challenges 
---
And does not mentats counter stealthboys?
---
seriously, why do we get penalized for surviving the longest? it should show that we arent looking for battle
---
I did the exact same thing. Got tired of it quickly and quit. It's too bad that you missed Fasnacht because I came back when I heard about that and had a lot of fun with it, but overall, it seems better than when I left, and I'm glad I came back.
---
And if you're on Xbox, I'll hook you up with a Fasnacht make to get you started!
---
It makes you wonder why that option has not yet been implemented. This way we will actually make use of our crafting abilities. I mean what is the point in knowing how to craft sturdy or heavy armor when the end game is all about armor or weapons with legendary effects? So let us outfit our low level alts since there is hardly any market for crafting armor and weapons for low lvl players. A shared stash would help this idea a lot..
---
If everyone listened to the nay sayers, imagine what we could’ve missed out on.
---
And more importantly, you never know you can’t, unless you try.
---
Or you could bring your own lvl 200?
---
Thanks so much!
---
You're not wrong. That's just $5 less than Nuka World was at release, which added a buttload of skins, armours, weapons, locations, quests...
---
Hell, it's $5 more than Automatron, which added new armours, weapons, and new gameplay mechanics.
---
Yeah I did uranium fever with 2 other players and we killed all 3 multi starred supervisors but none of us got credit, so it does seem like you have to do all the damage because when I was solo farming at whitesprings I got 1 registered kill. 
---
Also side note, have you ever gotten multiple legendaries from 1 enemy? Had this happen from a ghoul at whitesprings today in survival mode.
---
We're not worthy! We're not worthy!
---
It's the best method hands down and you can finally pick up the weights in the court yard and get more lead 
---
"You were trying to cross the border right? "
---
After seeing the snow physics in Red Dead Redemption 2, I shudder at the thought of Bethesda adding snow to Fallout 76...
---
It has 'disappointment' written all over it.
---
Yeah ppl have been asking a way to transfer gear to and from their alts without having to use a 3rd party.
---
Releasing anal retention should increase CHR and make one more personable.
---
Coming empty when it comes to naming the perk though.
---
Crouching doesn't hide you on the map if you're top 3. It's just very bugged right now where it doesn't show up at ALL for anyone. I was number 1 for over an hour on a server as level 5. I couldn't see the other 2, no one ever came for me. Happened to a few others I spoke to as well. 
---
Oh good!
---
Needs more crops so you can make more rum! Sweet irradiated rum Captn 
---
That makes sense, thanks 
---
This has been asked before and those saying you need to craft it are correct. That said, if you go to Welch Station, walk west along the tracks, and then turn left when you can see a destroyed red sentry bot on one of the lowest roads in town. You may have to kill some mole rats, but don't engage the mole miners. Sometimes that bot has around 80+ rounds of 5.56, and often, a fusion core. It's a bit of a crapshoot though, as it sometimes only carries .38.
---
Not worth going there just for the ammo, but it'd a good find if your travelling in the Ash Heap.
---
Well in my opinion it is a pretty dumb system.
---
 I wanted the extra danger of full on PVP,  I don't want a damn target on my back because I've avoided PVP the longest exploring for legendaries.
---
 As soon as I hit number 3 on the leader board I logged out and logged back in.
---
Very stupid system.
---
Bump
---
It was always about bullying and feeding egos.
---
Now that there’s a place where all bullies can hang, people are starting to realize their mistakes.
---
You can see it in their posts
---
Thanks for the advice I’ll look for it if I’m in the area
---
Lolz
---
Not gonna lie; was more than mildly upset that Ron Perlman didn't narrate FO4 or this game. Fix it, Bethseda.
---
I was in the Morgantown airport area the other night with a level 50 Scorchbeast flying over head, it's not the first time I have seen it there, but I noped it out of there anyway. I was only level 7. 
---
What you don't realize is that the developers WANT you to kill each other over and over.  It's a cap sink.  If they can take away your caps and now your aid items, it will prolong the content artificially. 
---
What this post needs is a, I got to Stabbed at stabbers point, shirt.
---
Haha! Touche.
---
Thats the beautiful thing about FO76. From "just exploring" that shack over to wandering around for hours and loosing track of time.
---
Hmmm. I have a 2* AA hunting rifle. Second modifier is +33 vats something. My vats crit alt is at level 36. I've been leaning more towards commando but that may change.
---
You can't use vats though.
---
Grenades are SO important for this mode. I started a new character and got to about level 6 last night. Was only killed by a guy who found me at Flatwoods when I hit top 3. As soon as I knew I was top 3 I stashed my loot and waited around.   
---
   
---
Then I happened upon a train station, a level 55 was inside and I tossed in 2 frag grenades and finished him with a gunshot. Made over 100 caps and got a ton of meds. If you are smart you will be fine in this mode, even as a low level. I didn't think the grenade trick would work but killing a 55 as a 5 was kind of hilarious to me.   
---
*My, have the turn tables....*
---
Or just make a level cap like literally every other game out there.
---
&gt;https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6wzJHNfuM1wa2mGyDq62yD/fallout-76-new-items-and-sales-in-the-atomic-shop
---
6000 here and I bought a few things already
---
It's meant to prevent players from cheesing/camping. It's a lot harder to do when 23 other people know where you are. Someone was complaining that people kept killing his lvl 1 at V76 but all they were doing was letting people know they were camping and probably easy targets
---
It’s not even a 3*? Lol
---
I haven't had any major problems, some Atomic Shop textures were missing, no falling through the world this time. I heard the proper FO76Custom.ini is now:
---
\[Archive\]  
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2
---
I mean you should be able to re aquire most and if they are super important like the whitesprings bunker I.d. then just make a small vending machine that dispenses one if you dont have it. Also there would be a confirmation screen just like destroying atom shop items.
---
Just like how they closely monitored and fixed issues from the game’s beta 
---
Members of the Enclave should know.
---
This is amazing! Definitely motivation for me to practice my CAMP game more!
---
And it is possible for the game to know whether the quest is finished or not and whether the item is essential. I dont need 50 gregs mine keys
---
Not sure, I can't buy pistols yet
---
It's a crashed American space station not an alien ship.
---
Nope still unmarked
---
The creation engine looks clunky and operates clunky. I don’t care how old it is or if it was made yesterday.
---
I'm a 102 lvl now and I still hate the SB. Mind I'm a melee build and a really casual player. I just launched my first nuke yesterday. :) I can understand why u want to advance the fast as possible, seeing the 200+ lvl people around. However it's not that important, enjoy the game and take ur time. ;) 
---
How little are you playi g that it takes you months to farm caps, junk, and aid items?
---
Haha. Yeh I've only died due to being shot when farming that extra 20% XP. 
---
thanks for the link.
---
Also, when I bought the bundle somehow I got Woodland Warrior Power Armor Paint for the Right leg as well. 
---
thanks cap
---
Follow the arrows partially obscured under the rubber mats on the floor. I didn't know they were there the first couple times, and then a random I teamed up with pointed them out. 
---
Well last patch they made updates to the ground assets, so the effect was more dramatic when the assets failed to leave load properly. This patch is more top layer oriented.
---
If my math is correct, it does nothing in regards to common weapons. 
---
Goes from 100 to 66 to nearly dead to dead.
---
Executioner would only help on the last 33.
---
This would be useful against a bloody sentinel build, but other than that, nope.
---
The Toxic Valley isn't all that irradiated unless you're marching through the boggy areas and streams. A gas mask or some other mouth filter (e.g. Veil of Mysteries) helps though. You can get a hazmat suit by climbing the exterior walkways/ramps at southwest end of the Poseidon Power Plant. There's a camper office up there with a hazmat suit.
---
I thought this was going to be the Fallout 2 trailer but just with 76 survival mod spawn camping cut into it. lol
---
Nice work, most high levels know about these, but it's great that you decided to share it with the community. Keep it up!
---
This made me do a spit take. LOL
---
Indeed, if you build your character correctly you're good to go around level 55. I took out a team that was playing the "hide everyone but one" game. Unarmed is OP.
---
It helps that I had a main that I could transfer legendary stuff from. Unyielding/bolstering mix.
---
They lost a ton of caps seeking revenge.
---
TBH PA just isn't that good. I don't even have the crazy assassin sent/cav armor but my base resistances easily beat 400/400.
---
Ugh don't get my started on builds lol. I have just been picking perk cards that have been helping me in the immediate. I would really like to get into the CAMP building part of the game as some people are making amazing places. I also need to find out if my mic is working properly, so I need to find someone in game that has one to see if they can hear me.
---
It isnt bad but compared to other newer engines, it's much more outdated. I mean, let's be real, the combat is beth game is not as fluid or quick paced as many other action oriented games. 
---
By market do you mean the Reddit Bazaar?
---
Ti's I!
---
The headless ghoulman
---
There are many things that are possible but when dealing with quest records and papyrus scripts, which is how this particular flag is usually handled, is always safest to err in the side of robustness rather than convenience.
---
Given the devs current track record I personally rather they did not touch it; not even the team who worked on FO4 managed to get this right even with stuff as recent as the CC content and if I have understood correctly the team behind FO76 is not even remotely as familiar with the Creation Engine and the people behind FO4 are.
---
Honestly, I see where you are coming from and I totally empathise but in FO76 - at least until private servers are a thing - I don't have access to the console so stuff like this makes me slightly twitchy.
---
You can't see chameleon. It's a great combo with sentinel when you are detected.
---
This mode mandates that you crouch the whole time.
---
If there is some mistake in the text, I will fix it now. I just wanted to get major findings out and the idea across.
---
Bethesda found palace for the little shits.
---
They built them a toilet to swim in.
---
Seems to be working.
---
When I use Bethesda Launcher to check for updates, it tells me "You are up to date" when the game version is still showing as "1.1.0.8".
---
Is there any way to force the update?
---
AH the spawn campers. Did no one really see this problem coming?
---
The engine does not scale well with today's hardware. Its inefficient.
---
Well I've found that it's hard to have every perk point to min/max at 50. Usually takes at least level 55 for me.
---
boo
---
Enclave isn't evil we love America and we have cookies.
---
Is one of those things "unless you are over leveled and have a bunch of duped gear you should stay out?"
---
Killed countless legendaries by my self at a nuked Whitespring. This shit’s bugged big time. Hope Bethesda compensates is...
---
Just don’t want someone to craft and scrap 500+ combat arms to try to learn the mod like I did lol
---
I've gotten first in time survived by just walking around doing very little.  I was down for PVP, not to be hunted for essentially playing the game.  Would be happy if people took the top 3 so I wouldn't get hunted.
---
It would have happened on a fair basis, which is the whole point you seem to miss.
---
Pretty sure the opposite is true bud
---
I absolutely how tense the wasteland has become. It feels like how leaving a vault for the first time should be
---
I made a purge styled character for the release of Survival &amp; have already had some "oh shit" moments
---
When you gotta go boil some water and shit for the overseers first quest, I had made my way down to the water to collect some when I heard the unmistakable sound of power armors. I turned around and 3 level 90s had surrounded my underwear wearing, baseball bat wielding homie. I froze up and waited for the innevitable mercy killing...but it never came. They simply gave me a thumbs up and went about their business
---
Then about 45 minutes later I'm just walking along, collecting flowers and killing molerats and shit when I hear "BANG" and a sniper bullet hit the ground infront of me. I've never serpentined so much in my goddamn life
---
Overall definitely an awesome experience.
---
I stand by that new characters required would have been alot cooler. Sure it may be staggered again in a week but that first week of questing, resource gathering and murder woulda just been litty
---
Enclave rules!!!
---
Nerd
---
Yes, but the gear that is really throwing things out of whack comes from a period of the game that was completely screwed up by duping. Hell, I think there would be less complaining even if everyone came in naked from adventure mode to survival mode. 
---
Gear is the problem. Duping was enough of an issue to tank any sense of a level playing field. Letting people go in naked would emphasize the fact that skill and dedication have paid off (or xp exploits, but if levels were gained with exploits, usually skill, or lack thereof, shows through soon enough). 
---
Thanks for this.. Know what I'm doing tonight lol
---
The folks who wanted to experience their characters true capabilities wanted a gaming platform without constraints. 
---
The ability to punish anyone they deemed worthy  of their wrath, without consequences or guilt.
---
They got it. 
---
Now They just have to share it with others wanting to do the same, to them.
---
KARMA, came a calling and handed every Whiney POS a cup of whoop ass.
---
My only wish about survival mode, is the ability to watch without interruptions lolz
---
For the random, kind and generous dwellers  in the past who have helped me and others against griefers,
---
Your new calling awaits...
---
Well your idea is not solving anything, after a month players will be level 200 and fully geared, so how is this fair for the new players that will join afterwards ?
---
At least now you have an option to go back get on on your feet then jump back to the spawn camp fest shit. Or you don't.
---
See with system at least  you have options
---
Level 2!
---
Make that bitch born and raised by murder and deceit. He may never trust another human in his entirety!
---
Tis what im doing, I wanna see how far I can get a "Survival ONLY" character!
---
Survival is for PvP AND survival. Otherwise : why can you do the quests ? Why do you have a 20% xp bonus ? Why is it called "Survival" ?
---
Also, how is it "survival" when you START with the end-game stuff/perks ? It has been proved, explained and shown multiple times that PvP is limited to one-shotting people who didn't see you with a critical. 
---
I do AWOL every time I see it pop up, I guess 40 times, outside of the SQB its the only 1 of 2 guaranteed 1-3\* level 50 legendary events.
---
 Your either extremely unlucky or I'm extremely lucky. 
---
Note:Although Monster Mash is also guaranteed 1-3 high level (I can't confirm, only done 2 or 3 times). Unfortunately the length of event and the cheering make it, for me, not worth it. 
---
World building is top not h, quests on the other hand 
---
You went to the most knownly populated spot on every server, in survival, numerous times and died?
---
Sounds like a sniper living his best life to me
---
Or build an acid collector at your camp and farm lucky hole mine with excavator armor. Using super duper, I’ve run off with literally 700-800 lead! I run out of steel like a madman now!
---
The 2nd character sneak sniper is op in survival just two tap them wait for players to go grab the loot and two tap them also soon you have hordes of players flocking to you for loot and you take them out before they know what hit them. 
---
Kept you waiting, huh?
---
You couldn't try a different server?  I dont think the guards are aggro'd on different servers if you have aggro'd them on one.
---
You expected your loot back? Your drops should have been gone the second your corpse dropped.
---
It was 2 am. I just went to bed.
---
I would love to create a character called patches o'houlihan that used a pipe wrench
---
I think the white springs would be a good trading hub. It’s big and there are vendor bots and workbenches. 
---
100% Agree. No markers, nor should player be able to see other dead players on the map.
---
Marking players on the map turns the game into a total death match. Encounters should happen organically in the world. It would lead to a lot less camping and abuse.
---
You could try kiting between the penetentary and Grafton. Super muties can drop 5.56 more often than other mobs. Between the prison, Grafton dam and Grafton itself, you've got a ton of super mutants plus, as described above, access to a lot of lead. 
---
I hate how you exclude the raider power armor in your excludings
---
Thank you!
---
Turns out the real legendary vendor was the friends we made along the way!
---
Glad y'all are enjoying the pvp but man what a joke. This just further compounds my opinion of "fallout 76 pvp is utter trash". 
---
I’M SO GLAD I FOUND YOU!
---
Atom blesses you
---
I got the camo for my T-51. I finally painted my X-01. My friend says I look like a turtle. I'm ok with that. Played Fastnacht like 25 times, no other camo armor. Feels good.
---
Did this last week. Good part was, I gave one bottle to a group of three, so I guess one of them woke up somewhere else :p
---
Correct.
---
I never liked that map feature. I get it, on Adventure mode if you're a really social fella and wanna chat to people and be friends, but...Survival is just that, Survival mode. It should be no presence on the map unless bounty (hell, even then I'm kind of meh on this). 
---
Then how do you propose to keep that level playing field? Gentleman's agreement that nobody levels up? Making people start new characters would just stall the issue by a week or two and then what? There is always going to be a victim.
---
Like I said dude, if u were on xbox I could get u started. Not that I'm a real good player, just I can relate as being a casual one and I had that feeling that everyone else is ahead. 
---
True, fair enough then but 50% is a bit steep.
---
I Don't think they should, making them part of a weekly or even monthly routine would remove &lt;h
---
But at least that would’ve all be gained in survival and people couldn’t use their stuff from adventure 
---
Seems cool, i just regret i will never play it since i like power armor and don't have any sentinel/assasin op gear
---
Fallout is an RPG not a shooter deathmatch / battle royal. On top of that it's the same problem as the scoreboard it's just inviting people to grief so they can have their name show up and feel big.
---
That scorchbeast won't attack
---
Too kind thanks!! It may get frustrating but it’s worth it in the end :) 
---
Wanted to make video how easy silos are. Got my ass kicked. Not as easy as i thought :D
---
i get attacked by lvl one scorched every hour. i do have some super mutants sometimes so i got like 4 turrets guarding one side
---
The "oh shit" moments are turned up to 11 with a fresh new survival character. It really makes you appreciate everything you manage to bring back to your stash. And yeah, that overseers C.A.M.P. part is terrifying. I heard footsteps and jumped off the bench and saw another low level naked guy running away down the road.
---
Your wearing a pipe boy that tracks all kinds of shit and has a map. Is it so out there to think that pip boys connect to each other and give location data.
---
This forum has been a shithole since day 1.
---
It run like shit to be honest even with good specs
---
I think the difference is there are no traditional PvP awards but yes I can confirm also seeing red named players if they join the event.
---
mark them for search.
---
Phones and typewriters i think.
---
I'm swimming in them
---
Can't wait to cream little rp nerds in survival, spend 20 minutes hoarding all that pointless shit did you? I'll take it all thanks
---
unyielding armor...
---
Helvetia basically became the player hub this game needs while the event was live.
---
Exactly this! If we must have a top 3 on map thing make it require at least one player kill since last death and prioritise the person with the highest kills. That way people aren't punished for just chilling and doing quests.
---
Ok that makes sense!
---
It is known
---
Don’t forget that 12 year old’s bird screeching nonstop directly into the microphone
---
Lol "survival".  Logging off and running to a different mode.
---
Some people want no restriction PvP but don't want to run around hunting people.
---
No the kill based Top 3 is stupid. In top would be only those 3 players who go around and kill each other. 1 kills 2, 2 goes to last, respawn goes to 1, kills him, becomes 3 now 1 comes back and kills again. Meanwhile 20 players are happily doing events like it was Adventure Mode. If I am not getting attacked middle of events, whats the point of Survival Mode. If I am not marked on map, no one is coming at me. I did first hour events, not seeing anyone at the events. Then when I got to top 3, that is when things got interesting, I started to meet people.
---
I feel like people who want it to be kill based are people who should go and play in adventure mode. They want it to be kill based so that they could easily farm with that 20% exp boost, without having to worry about PVP. And right now, if it was kill based, leaderboard would be f#cked. I mean you couldn't compete in something like "Most EXP" or "Longest Survival". People would just go afk, sit in corner and just see how they rank up in leaderboard. Right now, you can't do that. You can go and sit, but the longer you sit the higher the chances go that you get killed.
---
I dig the garage look. As long as it does what it needs, that’s all that matters. My friend built my house (I hate building) it’s a mansion. I get tons of anxiety when I see people around it (since I didn’t build it). 
---
I did it with my alt that was about 15-20 at the time. I woke up deep into the Mire and got killed by a high level super mutant. Cost 21 caps to respawn as I didn't get any location marked. It was even worse to sneak back to get the junk. At least I dicovered more than ten new locations along the way.

Version without the mouse in the middle of the screen.
---
So basically I should stick to walking around Watoga until a Legendary Protectron spawns and kill it and keep killing them for that survival challenge
---
Also worth noting that at Tanagra, you'll find Darmok and Jalad.
---
Fuck it already ended? I thought it ends sometime in April. So many things I'll never get now (Unless they repeat the event next year). Hard to keep up with ESO and F76 events at the same time.
---
Not using push to talk is harassment and ppl have to deal consequences: everyone should block those ppl immediately 
---
Just grind in Adventure mode until you're as powerful as you want, then transfer to Survival. Problem solved.
---
And this would been every new players life, after sometime, if we had locked characters. Atleast now these new player can go to Adventure Mode, gear up and come back when they are more adjusted to Survival Mode.
---
I never thought about the dragon being messed up, I got a bayonet on the end maybe Ill just shoot then stab people
---
The level does cap at 50. The only difference between level 50 and 300 is the time the 300 has had to get their gear squared. Would you say you arnt allowed to get gear after a certain level?
---
That’s the Charleston vendor 
---
I bought this game when I heard about survival mode. A multiplayer fallout with potentially the same intensity when stumbling upon a player like in Day Z?! Boy was I wrong lol. My friend and I innocently jumped into a new game and were one shotted multiple times as soon as we left Vault 76. After the 5th or 6th time we tried to use proximity chat to reason with folks but never even heard a response. 
---
Not just survival servers. On adventure, two server disconnects, one freeze screen without the courtesy of a blue screen, then imminent shutdown for server maintenance within a 2 hour period overnight encouraged me to watch a movie on Netflix. I'm in the middle of doing things. It's disruptive. I'm not opposed to shutdowns for server maintenance, but how about more than a moments notice. 
---
Miss everyone at Fastnach Festivities. Hoping we get to pull together like that again soon. 
---
I’m on PS4. I’ll check out that sub! 
---
hot switch to another gun I suppose
---
That's the case for perks but not for legendary armor. For example, just as in fallout 4, if you get 2 -50% falling dmg you will negate all falling dmg.
---
Camo Power Armor user here. Can confirm I am currently using this to hide in a conveniently-giant-size-tub of vanilla ice cream. Nobody has discovered me. Yet. 
---
If anybody sees a giant tub of ice cream out in the world, I'm not hiding in it
---
It's hard when the deep end is filled with hungry great white sharks ready to prey on innocent new borns like me.
---
Lol. Before the patch came out I remember reading a few heart felt posts of “plz don’t allow high level op people with duped items into the new game mode, make everyone start fresh”
---
I thought yeah....I agree with that, it makes sense.
---
Suddenly Bethesda is like “sorry bro” and bam, fucked again
---
The bounties is fair enough especially with how ludicrous the cap gain is if you kill people but the map reveal and killfeed are 100% not required. Who says you need to feel danger? The whole point of an online RPG game is that you can be who ever you want, if you want to avoid all contact with people and be a hermit then sure go do that. If you want danger and risk then go take them and make your fortune. Why should people be forced into risky situations? Just because PvP has had it's training wheels taken off doesn't mean every kid should be forced to cycle a marathon.
---
The engine is bad stop trying to defend it
---
I'll start my saying I love the game with over 430 hours, but it is very outdated. The graphics and lighting look great to me.
---
The combat is clunky, like when I can't hit multiple enemies with a wide swing, or miss someone because the hit detection is off. The way people/creatures move is very rigid, like a bunch of marionette dolls.. or the fact that the AI is really really really stupid, with outdated "tactics" compared to all other games. 
---
Not what I'm saying but if any level past 50 is pointless then why allow the levels to continue?
---
It gives the illusion of power.
---
If you see a level 300+ you are less likely to engage if your in the mid 50s range.
---
This would make perfect sense and I'd be fine with it if the extra legendaries for PVP challenges, were all legendaries with PVP effects.
---
But \*of course\* that's not the case, instead we are essentially getting bribes to try to coerce people into this new mode that not all of us want to use.
---
I got blessed with a explosive 3* harpoon yesterday from west tek and I’m positively sure I used up all my luck 
---
They wanted to implement a game mode where people that put the effort into gearing themselves for pvp had a game mode where their effort would be rewarded in a pvp environment, and for people that want to make a new character with faster xp gains but more risk. This game mode is what assassin/sentinel gear is made for, since it is wasted for the most part in adventure mode, because pvp is mostly non existent. As far as making a new character goes, I think a lot of people are overlooking the fact that this is still very new as well. The spawn campers will get bored of it after a while and it will stop (for the most part), and the mode will balance out to what it is supposed to be.
---
Cool thanks I’ll have to check that out!
---
Only if you do not understand context. Let's say you don't start in adventure mode, your argument collapses.
---
Add that on top of the fact they removed slap damage in adventure mode figure a lot of people will stay on survival
---
So someone has self-esteem issues.
---
Looks awesome
---
You're wrong champ, it's for people wanting to pvp
---
But it's totally scuffed as legendary armor and guns totally ruin the gameplay
---
Isn't that what he was posting about though?  Is there some other cap farming method involving workshops that is controversial?
---
Never played Fortnite but I decided to purchase FO76 for a unique experience. It's not really about "learning the game". I understand the mechanics of fallout and realize that you need to be a high level with some PVP catered build to succeed in this world, but it's very unbalanced regardless. I mean they give you the option when starting a new game to start an ADVENTURE playthrough or SURVIVAL. As a fan of more hardcore experiences, I chose survival thinking it would be something more balanced like Day Z where really any character has a fighting change. I quickly found that this community, (at least the people that I encountered during the initial day of survival), is extremely toxic.
---
I'm not. My main is 78 and my secondary is 46 and I fight 100+ people all the time. If you are fooled by the illusion of their superiority than that is on you. I do use that to my advantage though as those level 200 a holes also think they are so superior as well. Makes it easier to walk up and pun h them in the grill with my powerfist. 
---
I did. Only effects building, not modding. 
---
Thinking I might spend the weekend respecing the first character into sneak sniper and doing some legendary runs with it on the pve server so I have something decent.  
---
(My 2nd character has lots of great rifleman based weapons the first got nothing but a level 40 death tambo.. damn you RNG)
---
I had to muted one “parent” who was clearly neglecting a crying baby and another using expletives incessantly at his child for mishandling some appliance in the house and almost breaking something off of it.
---
If you don’t want to leave the world because you left a paper bag of gear to go sell other gear that encumbered you, fine.  But for the honor of the Brotherhood (best I could do on short notice) get your hands on a piece of Chameleon armor and go park your avatar somewhere while you attend to your family.
---
Lol...
---
Right! It rewards asocial behavior. Well mannered pvpers have to deal with the same crap and imbalanced.
---
Getting camped outside train stations repeatedly by people 4x my level :'( 2 shot weapons and shiy
---
Keep it named survival
---
Put a deathmatch mod where all legendary effects are removed from armor+ guns and you need to fight on certain map location
---
Well, if you listen to the Overseers tapes at the very end, she starts to realize they lied. It is NOT a control vault. They put they best and brightest in there. They gave the Overseer a mission to secure three nuclear bunkers, something they knew she could not do on her own, and which she admits in one of her first tapes. So she asks us for help. The bunkers automatically produce more nukes, but only short distance ones. This is a vault-tec experiment to see what would happen if you place nukes in the hands of regular, smart people without any military or tactical training. We are having a miniature nuke war, and it is all a vault-rec experiment. This is why our vault opened up so much earlier than most others, because everyone else is safe in their vaults while we kill each other. And we are probably monitored and recorded by automated vault-tec systems all along.
---
I had no problem them down in survival because there is no slap damage so you can actual sneak up on your enemies.
---
I need to figure out what these explosive 1 shot guns are tho.
---
Before survival came out there were quite a few people with explosive shotguns or somethibg and reguardless of levels perks/mutations they would 1 shot my level 101
---
Rename it to "Don't take any aid and caps with you - deathmatch".
---
Someone says this in literally every thread and someone has to explain why its incorrect in every thread, so tiring...
---
Games like The Division 2 do this wonderfully. Normalized PVP zones for people that want to experience PVP and don't want to/can't grind to insane levels or legendary gear, and non-normalized zones for people that want to fight people of similar level. Best of both worlds.
---
Really, no bad thing to say about this game until now? You haven’t played for very long ;-)
---
He did?
---
&gt; Fallout is an RPG I want to all builds being viable so people can actually roleplay. 
---
There is Adventure Mode for that.
---
&gt; The Leaderboard 
---
Is the greatest addition to survival mode. I played hour, not once did I saw player in event or on the road. Then I got top 3 and I started to feel how paranoia kicked in. And not long till I saw first player... and second... and third...and finally fourth that was able to kill me. Leaderboard is what makes action to come to you, you cant just sit in corner or do event and be safe from PVP.
---
&gt; PvP damage is waaaaaayyy too high and TSE 
---
TSE is your least problem. If TSE is already too much for you, you are in wrong build or under geared.
---
But the end result is basically identical. If this is a problem, then any potential solution (such as only letting people join the server if they're within 5-10 levels of the average level of players on server) should actually solve the problem rather than just kicking the can down the road a bit
---
Im not sure about Raider overlords since i managed to kill a group of 4 with all of them twice my level.  
---
By shooting their own mines.  
---
Which they had placed close to them.
---
Sure
---
Wish there was a small chance to find the masks outside the parade like how you can find the man mask in the asylum
---
rename surviva to battlefield
---
make your suggested mod as COD
---
then add mod Counter-strike
---
fortnite
---
tetris
---
oh my god.
---
The truth is they just punched in some script code and called it a brand new PvP mode. It's griefers heaven. It's garbage. I'll stick to adventure mode and if I want to compete I'll play real PvP games.
---
Yea it’s messed up 
---
20% was valid criticism tops, there was so much "I haven't played the game yet but it's a 0/10"
---
I did Nukashine twice. The 2nd time I woke up about 40 klicks from where I was. Never again.
---
++No shits left to give.++
---
*+damage to other players and player built structures.*
---
Explore. Discover locations. Kill things. Mostly kill things. 
---
I liked New Gad for finding lots of things to kill.
---
Do events. If very low level do Fertile Soil over and over. Morgantown for Collision Course. 
---
Craft stuff. 
---
Play the game. A lot. You get nothing when not playing.
---
yeah when I saw it was like 4 power armor skins + leather metal and combat armor skins it shows they are actually listening if just slower then people want them to be 
---
Report his messages and give em a coms ban. 
---
Just buy them from the Reddit market, absolute easiest way to obtain any item and mass quantities of them 
---
Jesus the amount of time you must have played to unlock all those crafting plans.
---
Well, we could borrow reasonable methods that work in other games. For example:
---
In Survival mode, everyone defaults to level 50 starting out and stays there, so that power levels are balanced. (Obviously, taking the player back to regular servers would restore your regular stats for play there, and your survival build would be saved separately)
---
Separate items in a similar way, when you first show up in survival, give some basic gear to each character, and the rest is earned through play. Keep your regular server items available only on regular servers.
---
This would help prevent huge level discrepancies from ruining the balance in that mode, same for gear. Yes, those who play more will get better gear, but they'll never be completely out of control like having level 260+ people stomping on level 1-5 players like we're seeing.
---
So? Sell some of the excess before you join Survival. Stims are easy to get in Adventure. Buy some plans or something if you don't want to lose caps.
---
Or, you know, don't play Survival if you don't want to lose your stuff. 
---
This community is extremely toxic no one is friendly and helpful.
---
So we can confirm that Bethesda has absolutely no idea of what they are doing in terms of PvP balance.
---
They should really, *really* ask for help from another studio that is experienced in these matters.
---
You liked the idea of bonus xp.  You really wanted the loot you gained shooting legendaries.  You wanted a separate mode for PvP.  Now you really want an exclusion to PvP in a mode designated for PvP.
---
Your greed shines bright, so bright.
---
I didn't think it would as its HP bar thing was white and not red, but still I booked it lol
---
Well, at least now you know how those Ghouls felt when you killed them. Perhaps it was a Ghoul with a sniper rifle that took revenge?
---
 **survival is a cool idea but how its been done is just strange... its just normal mode with pvp turned on...**
---
What I think survival mode should be:
---
1. New characters only!
---
2. Level Cap of 50
---
3. XP Rate increased by 300% (or however much is needed to get to 50 within say 5 hours of play)
---
4. Leaderboard top 3 is the people with most kills not how long they have lived!
---
5. Loot drops increased to match new speed of game mode
---
6. Characters get reset to level 1 at end of current week
---
I'm partly disappointed you didnt call them stealth bois
---
Ok......fallout snobbery......didn't see that coming.
---
I think it depends on the server. I usually hop untill I see Legendaries in Watoga and if I do I stay on that server. 
---
Patch 7 messed it up.  Maybe we'll see a fix by the time Patch 9 rolls around :)
---
Starting to find this out for myself. I mean hey I guess it's pretty immersive since an apocalyptic fallout world would most likely not be the most friendly lol
---
it broke with the last big update (not the one yesterday). 
---
Oh sure, alienate all new players. That's a **great** way to ensure the longevity of that mode/game.
---
/s
---
Filter what servers you can access based on level... duh
---
It's for the automatic shotgun
---
Nukashine blackouts are all fun and games until you wake up in the back of a cart
---
if every skin costed around \~190, I would already had bought that store empty with Atoms I earned from playing.
---
Survival mode is extremely toxic and If you are on the leaderboards at all the entire server will come after you.
---
I need to get me some cancerous 2 shot guns
---
"PVP bad, PVE, good"
---
Why? Not everyone likes PVP for griefing or to be asocial, we play for different reasons. Whether it be for a greater challenge, whatever. Some people just enjoy it.
---
It did in fallout 4 so it moat probably does too in 76.
---
Looks nice. Hope there's never a flood.
---
This is 22 days old. Why are you trolling nearly month old threads?
---
Your sentence structure and use of run on sentences, leads me to believe you have no writing skills...
---
Bethesda doesn't give a fuck about fixing issues with this game.
---
There's still day 1 issues they haven't even addressed.
---
I haven't played in a few months now but I'd bet the Power Armor issue where if you have multiple suits out the ability to collect them disappears forcing you to needlessly enter it and back out just to get the "collect" ability. 
---
This is of course itself completely unnecessary but you have to do it because Bethesda doesn't give you the ability to label ANYTHING properly by changing the name of the item to allow you to know wtf it is.
---
I've never seen a game go so far backwards and even stay that way without a slight fuck given by a big company as I have with FO76. 
---
Maybe add a saftey deposit box at the front of vault 76 to put quest items keys and notes in so if you need it you can get it and if you dont then you can store it in the deposit box.
---
If you die with zero caps do you get a debuff still?
---
I found that a handmade rifle with suppressor can be spammed in vats. I was able to melt max players with 2-5 shots with my stealth perks.
---
Leave it, it is.
---
Sometimes if there's a higher level player nearby the enemies spawn at higher levels. Try server hopping.
---
Bait lured him in for a second kill. A legit strategy
---
I really like that idea and hope for more timed buffs (negative &amp; positive) in genereal. I had a similar idea regarding smoking (which I hope will be possible in the future) that could look like this:
---
**Chain-Smoke** \- After smoking several cigarettes after another you gain +1 Charisma but get -1 endurance for maybe 10 to 15 minutes. If you become addicted you will get a permanent modifier giving you -2 endurance and no benefits.
---
I like pvp too, was always my focus in MMOs but griefing is no pvp, it’s griefing via pvp.
---
Hey I think you’re wrong, let me say what you just said but I’m a slightly different way to prove your wrongness! I’m really smart. 
---
How do you know there are day 1 issues not addressed if you haven’t played in a few months?
---
Yah I understand that it's currently a BETA, so I see the potential and recognize the major flaws. Personally, I think survival would be so much better without the leaderboards and a little bit of stat normalization. 
---
Go back to your care bear mode 
---
Lol 😂 
---
A player at a higher level was more than likely in those areas prior to you as spawns scale to said higher levels. Normal spawns for the "steal the mutants stash" is between 10-15 for Summersville.
---
I have all the explosives for an extreme makeover 
---
The way the game spawns enemies is based on the first person to enter an area after it's been vacant for some time (I do not know the actual duration required).
---
It can be unforgiving for lower level players who enter the Savage Divide area, as the level cap for enemies there and further east is very high.  So while a high level entering an place in the Forest area may cause a max of level 10 or so enemies, if they enter these other areas, they can cause level 40-60 enemies to appear, and stay there if they do not kill them.
---
Tetris lol 
---
The Savage Divide is a higher-level zone, and enemies can scale to their endgame levels there. It might serve you to break from the main quest for a bit and level up some more in the Toxic Valley and Ash Heap.
---
The third character will level up quickly, and as long as you play a stealthy way, you'll still be able to take out unsuspecting victims even with crappy ranged weapons. Get it to level 50, save CAPS, and buy something good from a REDDIT trade channel. TSE weapons are generally going for cheap still.. get a sniper type weapon, and stay away from close range for now. 
---
Just add them all to a single item, a key-ring, which has the IDs of all keys, cards and passwords we have unlocked. That way we keep all our accesses but only need one item in the inventory. Didn't this exist in a previous game, it feel familiar?
---
Looks humble, I know I could never build a base that big since I don’t have the blueprints to fill the blank space so I end up building a 2x2 and whacking that down wherever
---
And of you're on xbox I can hook you up with ammo and aid for free.
---
It’s because someone who was a higher level then you came through first...you can either switch servers...which might help bring the mole miners down to level 22... or just wait and level up a bit before going in. I had almost all of that quest done except for one kill I needed...but it was level 40 ..I was level 20.. so I waited, leveled up  ... it did help. 
---
Who says Survival should stop F76 being an RPG? There are options to show non hostile with your weapon away, quests persist, events still happen, and trade with non group members so it clearly still is. 
---
As for the top 3 if you want action and paranoia that's great all the more power too you! But people shouldn't be revealed for simply surviving, that's literally the game saying you must die to play this which, why? If the top 3 was based on killstreak then the only people revealed would be people like you that want to be revealed, go hunt the current top till you get one yourself and then boom, there's your map marker while questers, traders, and other players don't have to be outed.
---
Yet again, all builds should be viable in any well balanced game. TSE and one shot melee shouldn't be the only viable builds. I play a stealth build because I like playing as a cheeky breeky sneaky, why should I be punished for having variety? If something is massively op like those two "meta" builds (shouldn't have a bloody meta in an RPG anyway) then they should be nerfed or others buffed. If I see combat I'd like to have variety, tanks, stealth, snipers, rambos, soldiers, ane even psychos, and explosive builds when balanced. Everybody being the same is boring and everybody one shotting is annoying, there's no counter play.
---
Maybe it's just a numbers thing where there are always statistically likely to be at least a few at multiple locations, but for me it always seems like I find two and three star enemies in bursts.
---
I'll typically run through a handful of these locations and have noticed (again might just be confirmation bias) that if I find 1 *** legendary, I'll almost always find several more at the other locations.
---
It seems like I'll have several runs with nothing, then all of a sudden I'll have 3 *** enemies in one place and, then without changing servers I'll see 2 more in another, and so on.
---
Last night I had like 3 or 4 runs with just a few normal legendaries, then out of nowhere I saw 8 multi-stars over a couple of locations.
---
They should have damage reduction work like in NV where regardless of threshold or resistances, all attacks deal at least 15% of their damage. That or have the reduction from sentinel add to damage and energy resistance rather than be a flat percent reduction.
---
I died from one last night... that guy deserved the kill after going through a silo by himself while the rest of the server murdered one another trying to get at me in my mountain base. Agreed that they should not be marked on the map except to the launching team and there should be no warning for anyone.
---
Well you say that, my version is still really slow to launch and textures seem a bit buggy
---
It is just a hunter-rifle modded with starting attachments, so it is the attachments that gives the effect, If you craft a hunter rifle with identical attachments it performs identical. 
---
Omg thanks for this 
---
I had a level 60-something legendary show up for a hoard event in the Ash Heap. Not sure if that was usual, but I've been meaning to catch more of them since it happened (few days ago) but haven't managed it just yet.
---
Thank you all so much for a prompt reply on my first post!! Everything you lot are saying is making sense and I now feel I don’t have to give up on fo76. Happy days
---
For this reason, I would prefer the survival mode to require fresh characters.  Having all of the recipes suddenly becomes a significant advantage.
---
It's the bridge immediately by HF. Like literally spawn at HF and turn around. My last one was farther back closer to the mountain overlooking HF but it's way easier to line the foundations up right this way.
---
And berry mentats bug out and don't work on some stealth boy users.
---
I don't even think it's that important to have so much separation, as long as high level geared players aren't on the same server as a level 1 with a broken pipe rifle, I'd be happy.  There's just no way to enjoy a new character currently.  So far it seems the only people who are pushing back on separating low and high levels are those who just want to pick on people and I don't think the game mode should cater to those people...
---
Ya.  PS4 last night, and I crashed to blue screen 4 times in a Whitespring nuke zone on Adventure mode.  One of my teammates twice, third got out lucky with no crashes.
---
That's about 5x more crashing than we experienced in the last couple months.
---
I consider Andromeda to have been treated much the same as Fallout 76 was, which is to say: unfairly. Some bugs at launch (in the case of Andromeda, awkward facial animations that were later fixed) and an impossibly high standard built from wishful thinking and nostalgia... the reputations of two games completely tarnished because people were eager to watch them fail. I would've said "at least Fallout recovered" but it didn't really. It's got a relatively niche following, and to the wider world it's still treated like a joke, much like with Andromeda.
---
Easier to just set your camp in adventure and then swap back to survival.
---
Like Area 51? This game is in sore lack of Zetans!!!!
---
I didn't even think of that, but will definitely keep that in mind. We ended up changing to a party chat and muting all in game players so it was just me and my teammate. There was definitely a problem with in game chat last night because I don't think 12 year old Potato Chip Boy could hear me complaining about his eating habits and my teammate, standing next to me, couldn't hear me half the time or Potato Chip at all.
---
"I'll never listen to the masses again," says idiot who thinks the version of the game they've been playing is the same one from several months ago. The game is still not in a great spot. It's great you're having fun, but anyone who says the hate was unwarranted is fooling themselves. You didn't need to play it firsthand to see that, either. It was abundantly clear from the first streams of the game, even from the likes of Bethesda's most ardent defenders such as Oxhorn, that 76 was an unfinished pile of crap.
---
It didn't even look that great at E3. The lack of enthusiasm from the audience at the announcement was deafening.
---
Maybe you really didn't read the whole thing so oll try to be a little clearer.  I went with no junk on me.  I was only trying to get the legendary weapons off the legendary ghouls I tagged.  I only lost 120 caps.  I'm not complaining about losing anything.  I'm saying it's a ridiculous way to play an event in a looting game and you can have it.  You guys need to think about what you're reading a little better and you will have more relevant replys.
---
i tried to put all the same attachments on my rifle and it had recoil as normal. 
---
&gt; Use a very low level character. They actually excel in this situation. 
---
Idk, I saw these low level character in forest. I didn't even feel their damage in assassin set without mods.
---
&gt; Armor that isn’t Sentinel Assassin appears to be pointless. 
---
But you did you try staggering enemy with Sentinel set? I heard someone saying it is super effective. Or pumpking grenades.
---
&gt; Never touch this mode if you don’t have Sentinel Assassin or chameleon (prolly both tbh.) or a low level character or 0 caps and aid. 
---
I don't know. I am doing fine with just regular assassin set.
---
But it's intended as the same game but with pvp enabled, not battle royale. Making everyone start at a higher level would mean revamping the entire game. The issue of higher levels farming low levels isn't an issue of game mechanics, it's because some people are dicks.
---
Please, keep this for the 1st time looter shooter players. Most of the weapons are trash so do the legendary effects. 
---
See? Now go get you a life, BBO.
---
Gotta admit I saw someone else do that and decided I needed it lol! Definitely something I hope Bethesda adds to the building system (along with an undo feature)
---
If I listened to hivemind/masses I'd be playing Fortnite nonstop, which wouldn't be a very fun life. ;/
---
Wouldnt call it smooth sailing yet 😂
---
Said this ages ago. They should have just created a PVP area on the map with leaderboards based on whole long they survived/how many people they killed in the arena.

They obviously love PVP and are intent on pushing it, but it's a crappy way of implementing it through a separate mode. I mean, Imagine the hunter/hunted mode, but on a much grander scale - or even in separate locations that are tied to your character level. Beyond Watoga you can have all the level 100+ guys going nuts in a new town and in the forest you'll have all your characters up to level 20 having fun. 
---
The way they've done it just feels lazy and VERY unimaginative.
---
Ah ok that’s what I thought. On the server I tried last night though eventually the people actively killing each other ran out of junk to drop and I had to make some educated guesses and leaps of faith fast traveling to nearby events. I probably need to be more aggressive in getting to the people who are killing each other while I still see loot bags. 
---
It’s a little dismaying how the ‘invulnerability period on respawn’ seems to not exist yet, and that dying will drop nearly 3/4 of your aid items. I loved the tension of exploring in fear of everyone else, but as soon as you hit that leaderboard, you can kiss all your stimpaks goodbye. 
---
As of now, survival seems to be moreso geared towards PVP-only play and not traditional survival-adventure. (Or if you happen to like respawn-camping, apparently.)
---
No no and no
---
I’m hoping this whole deathmatch part of things will die down as time goes on. I just wanna play the normal game with genuine risks.
---
It says pump action shotty in the package description, 1 of the reasons why I got it. Hope it is just bug and not another Bethesda con.
---
Already said I wasn't going back genius.  Thanks for the advice though.
---
No, you're a faggot 😀
---
Something as seemingly minor as knowing the majority of the cooking recipes in Adventure mode suddenly becomes a significant advantage in Survival mode.
---
Now consider the advantage sentinel and assassin gear provides.
---
Within a few weeks, many players would be able to grind that gear again in Survival, but at least it wouldn’t be immediate.
---
Didnt he? I could have swore he was in the fo76 trailer or is that Biran Delaney 
---
Yep, I've experienced this issue a number of times on PC, over the past months. It hasn't happened consistently, the most recent being just a week or so ago. I believe it was a couple wooden foundations, upper floors and walls that went missing.
---
You should've played on release. The hive mind wasn't wrong.
---
Everything's mostly fine now. 
---
Lag/Bug?   
---
I one shotted enemy from Sniper Rifle and he was downed while he had 20% hp left and this guy has basically 1% and doesn't die.
---
Where’s the door for me to bust down?  Where’s the bed for me to then take a nap in?
---
Thank you so much!
---
The exclusion I suggested was for your benefit.  I already said I wasn't going back.  Like I said in the other reply you guys need to think about what you're reading.
---
So on PVP mode people should just say "Oh he's level 31, I'll leave him alone?"
---
lmao, okay
---
It definately seems like gank teams will rule the wasteland.
---
There was a team last night that had a guy who would stay stealthed constantly in sentinal armor, and spam a tesla rifle. Never realized how much damage, and how high of a range those things have. He was killing everything.
---
maybe only the legendary effects should work in normal mode, and have no effect with other players  What kind of balance can exist if someone kills you with 1 shot?  In my opinion, the legendaries were the worst idea they could implement 
---
Crunch crunch crunch 《DANNY CLEAN UP YOUR FRIGGIN ROOM INSTEAD OF PLAYING VIDEOGAMES 》

---
Thanks! Fixed
---
I lost a couple back in December with all that duping and dropped connections.
---
I think they’re happy playing conan.
---
TL;DR I'm a whiny child.
---
Explosives would be amazing
---
I got it to work from the front gate
---
You have a better chance beating the SBQ at that lvl lol
---
Pretty much lol
---
I just had someone put a 6,000+ cap bounty on me?!? I was near Vault 76, a player ran bye but didn't have hostile (red) indicator. I attacked them and they waved back at me, so I waved to them. Shortly thereafter, another player showed up (hostile) whom I killed. Then, the first player showed as hostile, so I killed them. That's when I got the bounty. I logged off but how I wonder if it was some kind of scam where they were acting as a team and were going to try to kill me for the bounty. Weird.
---
Ahaha, more dramatic is definitely an understatement.
---
What’s your username?
---
Interesting - I just went there as a 48 to see what I could find, and there were only super mutants around. There was still a legendary one there but I went expecting ghouls haha. 
---
On the plus side, one of them had a mini gun and didnt fire it so I got 500 free 5mm. 
---
There are so many challenges that don't properly track that I have given up on challenges long, long ago.
---
Like the one for killing the biggest baddies.  I have killed the Scorchbeast Queen about a dozen times and it has yet to give me credit for it.  Same with the Mirelurk Queen and Behemoths.
---
Thanks! Gonna take a look at these places.
---
It would make dysentery so much worse than just sporadic food and water loss. 
---
I know, right? Would be so wonderful. 😢
---
As long as they have a leader board I will not be playing on that server. I wanted the added danger I didn't want  the magical map marker to appeare on me If I stay alive the longest.
---
 I wanted a normal fallout experience with the added danger of other players being able to kill me without slapped damage.
---
 As it stands right now unless things get changed it will always be a death match type system because of that dumb leader board.
---
I scrapped close to 800 Combat Armor Arms before realizing I couldn't learn BOS or Deep Pocketed mods for them that way.
---
I ended up buying them from another player, after searching and searching at armor mod plan locations and farming events and maps in the Bog with no luck.
---
Had I known they were going to be this elusive I would have picked them up in Welch and Grafton every single time I saw them.  They used to show up fairly regularly there.
---
The lack of Bethesda response on missing armor mod plans since the Vendor patch months ago is disappointing.  And it doesn't seem 100% intentional, as certain ones like "Marine Armor Deep Pocketed Limbs" are 100% available at vendors, but Marine Armor Deep Pocketed Torso is not...
---
At first I tried everything: the gate, inside a tomb, inside the church, on top of the church, nothing worked.
---
Hmmm. Do you know the person's username? I'm curious if you saw my build. I've yet to see another on PC that does the bridge stone wall thing.
---
Probably meant crouch with chameleon gear + stealthed and forgot.
---
If people start dropping less and less aid, they're likely going to stop dropping stuff eventually. Everyone on the map can see their drop bag, so instead of taking it, leave it so others know to come there. Let others who have loot come to that marker. Kill them and take their stuff. Repeat until they run out and bob's your uncle
---
So fun not being able to play cause you load into the game dead, right?
---
Yep. They need to adjust some serious game mechanics too, like removing Legendaries, vats, and stealth boys. 
---
I'm 75 as well and had a great time. Had the most kills, longest life, made a few friends with this weird glitch I found. Eventually I was the only person in the server.
---
I went through watoga a few times last night and didn't see a single legendary, it could just be coincidence.
---
Bethesda has no clue in wat it is doing. Absolutly no clue. For my part they can close there buzziness. I will be in the survival trolling people with my duplicated 2 shot explosive i bought from a dude yesterday for 6000 caps. Just to make my point. 
---
Should do damage if you have rad worms. And since it's Fallout, explosive diarrhea should be literally explosive.
---
Nothing really changes past level 50 though... 
---
I was raider before, now i am scared of losing my shit, even tho i have sentinel armor and other top things.
---
If I see a level 300 the first thing I think is how I can spend all those caps.
---
Did you know the popularity for the game was so high during the beta than when it launched, there waa a queue to *buy* the game?
---
I'm level 99. I picked up two explosive legendary guns last weekend. Nuked WS and Uranium Fever are my normal grinds. Inspect every drop you get. My Junky's handmade had a second star - explosive. 
---
Of course they are. Still doesn't stop me from selling the select 1* for 1k caps and the decent 3* for 3-8k caps. Sell enough of those while doing vender runs and you have a nice stack of caps for a legendary that fits your build.
---
apparently sentinel does nothing to PvP energy damage. just got spawn killed by a dude before i could even load in. Jumped to further point and ran back. dude laid-waste to me in like 0.75 sec. Even vats crit builds take longer to kill me usually. 
---
I have that issue with the Responders cemetery.  No matter where I take the pic it doesn't count. 
---
For Watoga, what's the security task force? I've never seen that do you have to literally kill the whole city or something?
---
I completely forgot about it tbh. I still think the power armor set paints should include the raider, Ultracite and Excavator 
---
You need to play like everyone else does.
---
Put all of your droppable items to a low level mule and go in there just to smash heads.
---
If you die, you lose nothing.
---
If you win, you get stuff.
---
Once you amass a ton, leave the game, deposit at mule, and rinse/repeat.
---
Adjustable Wrenches also
---
I don’t mind being killed... IN FAIR COMBAT. There just isn’t anything you can do to survive lvl 264  XXp4wnsnoobs6969 and his instigating mirv fatman
---
I got the game on release day. After all, I live for Fallout and Elder Scrolls. I took a couple days off work to play it. I was so excited that I couldn't sleep and I ended up just staying awake.
---
I get the game home and I'm playing it, going along just fine. I'm really liking it, to spite the fact that I normally **hate** multiplayer games. I encountered a couple bugs but nothing really game breaking until I picked a mutfruit that had literally nothing around it, except other wild mutfruit plants. 
---
I got a bounty, figured it would be like the warrant stars on GTA, and went on about my business. The thing is, it's not like the warrant stars on GTA. I got killed a few minutes after getting the bounty. I re-spawned in the same place and promptly got killed again. And again. And again. I tried to respawn at a nearby area, thinking that the level 200 something shitbag would have moved on.
---
I had encountered a glitch that wouldn't remove my bounty when I got killed. I was beyond disappointed. I was legit depressed over something that I'd spent months looking forward to wasn't in a state where I could use it. 
---
I ejected the game, put it back in its case and there it sat until the day before yesterday. I put it back in and I'm in the process of giving it another shot but really liking how things are going with it.
---
I'm not talking about battle royale.  You want to see a good example of this mechanic at work, look at Guild Wars 2.
---
Want to play PvE? Great, you get the level grind and the full experience. Want to play PvP? Then you're sent straight to max level -while in PVP areas-, and get given some baseline gear so you have some chance to compete. 
---
There can be SOME difference in power levels between players, but otherwise the -only- people having fun in the PVP portion game are the ones who ARE dicks and are already at a huge advantage for being a high level.  It's usually a bad idea for the game company to make a PVP game that favors only the established, high-level pricks, because any new players don't stick around, the playerbase dwindles, and the game goes down the tubes.
---
This is actually an awesome idea. It would make all guns viable, and stop max level traders from running the show.
---
Not a new error, just a rare one.
---
I got it all the time (4 outta 5 tries) when I was on a business trip and had to play from a Hotel.  (PS4).
---
I switched to my phone hotspot to get it to work.  It seemed to be related to the internet connection, or the router system being used.
---
Never a problem on my home internet connection.  Sometimes within the same day (I travel back and forth often).
---
Lol, you should be more careful QQ
---
I agree. It's essentially magic in the Fallout Universe. If they had instead just had different ammo types, everyone would have the same advantages.
---
Yeah...I got 2 toons up past lvl 100 in the first month. And holy flaming dickposts.........There was bugs!. 
---
I started downloading a few min ago becouse we heard It wasnt so bad anymore.
---
Except I was playing FO76, not Preteen Boy or Angry Mom. I've played Angry Mom before and it was NOT my favorite game. I stopped playing that game when most of my offspring finished the Tutorial phase of Life and started playing open world instead. 
---
I’m gonna keep playing it. I’ll just be keeping an eye on the map. As soon as I see I am in the top 3 I am switching from “normal” play mode, and stashing my stuff and getting ready for battle. 
---
At work rn man, will be on in around 4 hrs. Gt terryboff, just drop me a message and I'll reply when I'm on later and we can meet up 👍Could even team if you need help getting through your missions.
---
No man i gonna take my duplicated two shot explosive i bought yesterday and i will troll the shit on “survival” 
---
I really enjoy trading with other players in game, it’s frustrating that most of what this game has become is buying up items at a massively inflated cost on sites like this. I appreciate that this is viewed as a convenient extension of that in game mechanism but for me it defeats the object. It encourages people to just buy what they want rather than earning it, and it’s that attitude that’s ruined the game and its economy already.
---
Or Bethesda could actually do what they said they did, and make it so you couldn't be killed before you could actually see and control your character.  ;p
---
I'm sorry, but i find this bug amusing. But a bug is a bug and i hope it will get resolved soon. 
---
Soo basically your OP build is useless In survival mode so instead of changing it you came here crying? Change your build or go play adventure mode.
---
I like the idea of level matching but maybe a little mor flexible day 1-50 then 50-100 and finally 100+ it would give my level 30 a chance to survive more than 10 mins
---
Give it some time to settle. 
---
My thought was, day 1 (week 1 more likely) all the "OMG PVP HAHAHAHA" folks are going to dive in and people who didn't read the update will be raging and so on.
---
Look at the 50 posts from yesterday about people not realizing they'd be dropping aid items too.
---
Then the novelty of increased PVP will wear out a bit, and people with short attention spans will move on, and there'll be a bit more breathing room for people that want to do more than JUST hunt down other people non-stop.
---
Survival or Adventure?
---
Oh wait... You're not op 😅
---
A lot of people are under the assumption you can be invisible + tanky. It's not really that simple and they're really spongey when they're crouched. Crouching hides you, but if you're found you have no protection. They can stand and use a stealth boy to avoid, but at that point you're relying on staggers. Most weapons have a stagger perk so the only people that are at a significant disadvantage are full health melee people.
---
No genius I was smart enough not to pick up any junk.  Just talking about my legendaries which I obviously didn't lose. 
---
I felt like a tough guy until someone naked appeared and killed me in one fell swoop.
---
without understanding what happened
---
in peace, rest my caps and stimpaks
---
Currently I’m level 39 but I could trade you for some stuff as I’m in need of ammo
---
So you join the Survival Servers with your low level low gear Character with ppl in it that are waiting for this mode and gearing up towards it and you now complain about getting killed by said ppl. I hope you see the idiocy in your post my friend.
---
The entire game is like $30 and MSRP is $60.
---
Explain to me in what reality is a couple of skins worth 1/4 the price of the entire game and all it entails? Shit should be like $2.
---
I got a message from support saying that they are aware of this and are working on fixing it.
---
This is accurate 
---
Discovering places in Savage Divide has some that won't credit for me so unable to finish that one. 
---
Consider how much you grind useless legendaries and how easy it is to make 1200 caps a day. Now consider how quickly you can get 15k caps (call it 2 weeks) vs how long you have been grinding legendaries. Which will get you a nice legendary first? 
---
Duping isn’t solved or ever will be. They patch bandaids which fall off after a few weeks. 
---
A few skins for 1/4 the price of the entire game... 
---
Yea I'll hook you up man. Have pretty much every ammo spare apart from 5.56 and shells... dems mine ha! I'll sort you for free if you're lower than Lv 50. Have tons of stims, rad x and rad away you can have too
---
Yeah, yeah. See you in a week or so when you have nothing left to do.
---
I wasn't talking about you... 
---
I was talking to the hypothetical noob on survival. 
---
And you drop aid items as a penalty for dying in survival? Or did you not read the blog post before logging In either? 
---
If this offer is still available, I'll buy some from you! IGN: Sinistas.
---
I leveled 2 toons past 100. I put in the hours. I didnt make a review. I didnt rate it. THE GAME DIDNT EVEN DESERVE THE HOURS I SUNK INTO IT in the first month.
---
In my lower levels, I mainly stuck with a hunting rifle (which I modded out as i unlocked mods), a shotgun, and any melee weapon I could find (medium speed seems good). Armor at that stage would be tough.. I'm pretty sure I used whatever armor I could pick up, and equipped whatever had better ballistic defense stats. Yes, there are ways to farm for legendary items (Whitespring golf club), which could help you, but you'll also have to do it again after you hit 50 to get better gear.
---
This gives me an idea for a new character, one that doesn't loot anything except for food, water and equipment. No chems, no caps, no stimpaks, no junk. Her camp will just be a mattress in the woods! 
---
Yep removing legendary modifiers would greatly help balance in survival
---
It's almost like it's a *beta*
---
my 5000+ ammo reserve. I have a legendary that is +25% ROF. so it spews ammo even faster 
---
Their will be an icon in the social menu to let you know if their on survival mode
---
I'm just realizing what an absolute bitch Rads are on a new survival character lmfao
---
My dude has like 3/4 of his HP all red, it's like survival hardcore atm
---
If it is new characters only just so it is a level playing field, characters should be reset monthly so the field is always level.
---
If you didn't read how do you know it was whiny?  Try making sense
---
Thanks, I hopefully will be on later but if not tomorrow
---
You mean people who aggressively farm others for caps in Adventure don’t like losing caps when they get killed? 
---
And now they want to make changes to the cap/PVP system less than 24 hours after survival mode launched? 
---
Boy, I sure never saw this coming. 🙄
---
Also, watch out for scammers who lure you in to killing them, then put a high bounty on you, and have friend kill you and split the bounty.
---
I'm pretty sure that's what just happened to me. They put a 6,000+ cap bounty on me but I got away and logged off.
---
They didnt in 4 but they did in 3 and nv i dont see why they got rid of it it was a great idea.
---
A journal for notes
---
A kayring for keys
---
A holotape deck for holotapes
---
I just came back after seeing this update because i bought fo76 to kill other players, but instead I was killed by someone gliding around shooting electricity spells out of their gun. 
---
7minutes you are hero!
---
My average is about an hour. But by then I am the longest life and people are coming for me.
---
Add in no legendaries and you have yourself a winner
---
No worries man. Just drop a message to my xbox and I'll get back to you when I can. May have a couple low Lv legendaries you can have too 👍
---
Did they smile and wave at you too? That's been my experience twice now with encountering other players at the event. We are both in it for the farming and ignore each other. 
---
Good this way they force Bethesda to remove PvP from adventure completely.
---
I'll give it a look tonight, report back if it says anything 
---
Not offhand. They did a "chevron" build on the HF bridge and shared it to fallout76settlements though. If that's you then it was a great idea! I thought I was really creative when I first built on top of the bridge months ago, but I've seen two or three people do it since and I'm seeing that 76's building community is just really creative
---
An "Appalachia" bank would be nice
---
No I really didn't expect that.  Just thought maybe at an event like a nuke zone or fashnact parade there might be some quarter given.  I have no idea how you'd do the queen.
---
Survival that’s why it’s partially my fault lol.  we were teamed due to event and as soon as it ended I was slaughtered. Jokes on them tho I had no caps or aid
---
Everything above your ankles is gonna be a fine red mist!
---
False! There are still people who wait for you to take a zone and then insta-kill you until you give up and they just take your base and do nothing with it. Then they follow you around so you can't take any zones.
---
It amuses me you think this "fixes" anything! 
---
A few skins for the cost of entire dlcs in the past? Not a good deal at all, don't fall for it. 
---
Wow... this is an incredible build. Great job!
---
Definitely a 12 year old. And I'm hardly a "pensioner" at (never ask a lady her age) years old. 
---
Bug: XB1. The Gatling plasma defaults to clip to the number of plasma cores, not the amount of shots in the core itself, upon quick switching to the gun.  Example: I have 20 plasma cores. When I quick switch from my .50 Cal to the Gatling plasma, I only have 20 shots in my clip opposed to 200+.

Selling stuff to vendors is the easiest and you can make 1400 caps per day. There's seven vendor factions around the map, each with 200. 
---
Haha nice. Sucks you didn't get the legendary, but nice
---
Did you play the game
---
Yes! And not being able to pick up duplicates!!
---
He’s not talking about low levels being camped... you can only spawn at trains an vault in survival so camping the vault is camping anyone that spawned there
---
funny! I have a bottle of 'shine I haven't drank yet. been focused on restocking supplies. then I paired up with the guy yesterday that posted here looking for a team-up.  had no plans so I tagged along. great time, dropped me right in on scorched beasts and nuke zone. 
---
dammit, now I need to start all over on an ammo run.
---
Not good idea to show ppl where your camp is.
---
And a few becomes many, it may take a little bit but not nearly as long as you think for people to grind out OP armor and weapons and every and in a few weeks new person would be met with the same greeting they are getting now. 
---
It’s better it happens now while it’s in BETA and nothing is set in stone, so proper adjustments can be made. 
---
Key ring alone would be a amazing 
---
I’m meaning NPC traders, human NPCs you can interact with not enemy NPCs. Not terminals and robots 
---
the NPCs are just robots and Grahm. There wont be any human npcs because with the lore of the game basically all humans either mutated or became ghouls/scorched or just straight up died from something idr what though 
---
Plenty of NPCs all over this game.  Recent patch just added one of the best ones in the game so far.  Biv is great.
---
What are the better items to sell? 
---
Its not so much as to level the playing field as it is to keep your character on one mode and 1 mode only.
---
 Being able to switch back-and-forth at any time just doesn't make sense to me.
---
 With no map markers and no leader boards it wouldn't be as easy for high level decked out players to find other players to kill. It'll still happen but not as rampant as it's happening in the current survival mode.
---
 I wanted survival mode with full PVP but I didn't want an arcade style dumbed down version of it.
---
I’ve got a spare flag pole if you want it? Honestly ill just take some wood scraps for it since I just ran out 😂 gt KnowledgeHound 
---
Well i never had a problem since yesterday with the new update. 
---
Yeah but also bear in mind, TSE weapons wee never supposd to be this common, the only reason ever 2nd person and their dog has one is because of the early dupers that distributed them everywhere, then people were allowed to keep them
---
You can really tell the pvp builds from the normal people ay. I had the same thing when I went to kill a bloodbug. I was murdered short after by some level 200 something and I’m lvl 36 I know the struggle
---
This convo was while the servers were down.  Pre patch
---
Melee is outclassed regardless of damage these weapons can do. They simply cant compete with ranged weapons and VATS.  If everyone on PvP was melee, I'd have fun shooting off their death-claws...lol
---
200caps per one ScorchBeast Queen. If you get best group in game, you can do silo per 7mins and kill her in 3mins. Thats 600caps per half a hour, then server hop.
---
Give it a few weeks and you'll be back begging the newbies to stop running just so you give them stuff to help lol
---
Does this bank include a grammar class ?
---
I never listen to the masses. I listen to any news, sure, like what's going down at launch from game news sources, but the negativity was all BS and people who never played the game decided they had something to say as well. It's sad. 
---
Glad you didn't come to this sub in the beginning either. It was a mess and filled with random outrage. But online games are typically very rocky at launch no matter what, people just "expect" things from a "triple A game". It's well on its way to a fantastic game in the next year. Take Elder Scrolls Online for example. Awful launch, but it's now one of the best MMOs to date. 
---
Glad you've found a nice survival game. It's very relaxing at times, and I love the CAMP and building, it's much better and easier than Fo4
---
I would recommend the Somerset special, a combat shotgun with perforating magazine if possible, and I had a hunting rifle for a while because how common they were along with the ammo early on.
---
It is fairly easy to get a two shot weapon on the trade reddit and you dont actually need sentinel or cavaliers gear in survival,  so i really dont understand why everyone is making a  fuss out of the gear.
---
I think the real problem is that ppl dont know the game mechanics and are not able to make a proper build. 90% of the builds i have seen posted here are Bullshit, and i mean like superbullshit, and the other 10% were horribly unoptimised. 
---
Don't spawn at stations. That's your bad. You can fast travel to events which I find to be much more safe.
---
If you don't have toilet paper in your inventory it should give you a temporary -1 CHR debuff.
---
There are a ton of perks that counter high perception also.  Stop being a noob.  Jesus lol.  Just play the damn game.
---
Anyway it's more of a warning to anyone thinking of trying survival mode but not maxed out and prepared than it is whining.   I've mentioned several times here it really didn't cost me anything.  120 caps is what I lost for over 1500 xp earned.  I guess I lost some random aid items. I really have too many anyway
---
I managed to score an explosive one.
---
You didn't answer the question
---
So only high levels are allowed in the survival mode? And can you tell me exactly why low levels  can't play it ? 
---
Remember that high levels started low as well. 
---
And maybe they also wanted to join challenge mode , but hey , you can't , your a noob...
---
If I want to play the challenge ,then let me .. . 
---
You make me feel unwelcome in the ' greedy' world of challenge mode..
---
It's not the question that's idiotic , but the answer is idiotic to my humble opinion. 
---
Freedom of speech.. .
---
Maybe they should switch on invincibility until level 5 like how you are not effected by hunger or thirst.
---
Yeah I played the game but you didn’t answer mine either 
---
Be more careful how? Seriously. You spawn - you die. 
---
To think they even had the wave emote back in 1998
---
Super unrealistic though, there's no way an entire squad of people will have the blackbird paint for their x-01
---
PvP free for all and spawn points without real PvP grace timers.
---
Who saw that one coming.
---
Diluted chems, bobby pins, and bulk junk. Also you might not want to play survival until you have better gear and perks
---
I have far too much wood; would be happy to give you 200 or so. GT is AVirtualDuck. When is convenient for you?
---
The answer I was looking for 
---
I didnt knoq this im so mad at myself
---
I’m on now? 
---
It does look good, nice and cozy but it needs a toilet or just place a portable one outside. Don't do it in the woods, you'll get your ass bitten by a tick.
---
The only head gear that provides good protection is a power armor helmet. It's easy to kill people with little to no head protection.
---
Eh, I always wait for a sale. I think of it kinda like a food I want to try but it's expensive normally. It's on sale, I buy it and try it out. Things go on sale a lot in the store, just takes patience. I'm a CAMP guy so I wait for all the CAMP goods to go on sale. 
---
Yeah currently at 5/25 done for the new weapon
---
This is what I’m gonna do when solo playing get that extra boost..
---
Hmm well i was pretty unkillable while sprinting.  I never died until I stopped to attack.  It always takes two hits it seems now no matter your damage. So I just keep my bloodied build at 50% now.  Played like 5 hours yesterday night and got a lot of kills.  Most my enemies we're using explosive weapons of some sort.  Explosive shotgun were easiest to counter because the rate of fire was too slow so even if they stagger me I started sprinting again before next shot.
---
Renaming it Hunger Games is more accurate.
---
To be number 1 :-)
---
The fact it started getting shit at E3 dhows that this game was gonna be attacked from the start
---
They work, just not consistently 
---
Spawn somewhere else? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
excuse me what the fuck
---
Same here I just thought I was unlucky maybe the game glitched Everytime I completed it so yeah I definitely don't do it anymore
---
I agree. I can use stations or any of the other stashes in the world. Yesterday I found that the stations on the edges of the map are not usually filled with campers. 
---
&gt; was helping a friend transfer them, they never stayed on my acc

Let's be honest. The Survival mode design, allowing high level players to join, etc, is just one more in a **long** line of decisions for 76 that shows that Bethesda has no experience, and about equal levels of talent, in balancing a multiplayer game.
---
I can understand why they wanted to try it, but they have a LONG way to go before they'll be making any big successes in that arena.
---
OK, hang tight; I will get on shortly. My mic is not with me though :( Meet where? My camp is near the Wendigo cave.
---
Best part is watching them complain about getting nothing for killing people with nothing. 
---
You in the wrong subreddit?
---
Shouldn't have helped your friend dupe.
---
Your camp is fine just send me a team invite when you get on 
---
i do, just behind the base you cant see i have like 10 razorgrain crops
---
Good to know, thanks! On one hand that can be annoying but on the other, if i forget to shut it off it takes care of itself.  I'm sure the light part can also be modified if I take the time, I'm not unfamiliar with electronics.
---
Got it :)
---
You didn't have a Bloodied Chainsaw.
---

---
yeah one shot at spawn points spawn camping? i thought u were invincible for a few seconds
---
Too wordy. Keep working on it. But, I like where you are going.
---
I would certainly hope so ... but with no easy way of testing this, I was hoping someone has the means to see if that is actually the case. 
---
Beta
---
Goddamn man i love your interiour design style!
---
Hopefully never
---
Haha was that you? I knew you'd be back so I waited in one of the side rooms for you. Easy loot, easy caps. Thank you sir
---
SPAWN KILLING BACK TO BACK?
---

---
You don't have to believe me. Bethesda can literally look for themselves and see the most I have more stealthboys than I do nuka. Also, I really don't need caps since I've been running full Cavalier's since December. 
---
So, Fallout timeline wise, we are the very first vault to open after the nukes.
---
All the surviving humans are now either ghouls, scorched, or super mutants.
---
In the future, our descendants will be the raiders and people of the wastelands.
---
Recently I got bored with building my base and was invited to do some pop fighting at one of the worlds workshops because other people were bored and it seemed like fun. The "team" I joined was trying to hold the workshop while others attacked. Everyone on the attackers side apart from 1 low level guy had instakill weapons and were super high levels which after about 5 mins of death, spawn, walk 5 inches, die and repeat got super boring and I just didn't attack so I could get back to having fun. Survival basically means I could never get out of the situation unless I quit the game. 
---
That's my problem. I've got no problem with the idea behind the game mode or anything like that but I have a massive problem with the fact that people are now going to be able to lock you into a constant spawn-death cycle which will ruin people's experience of the game. And if you say "just fast travel away" yeah good point but you'll run out of caps eventually and then you are stuck. There is no build that can tank an instant kill. There's probs a build that can tank 2 shots from it but that gives you a fraction of a second to try and evade or kill etc.
---
Hopefully when it's out of beta they will have changed stuff like this. Thanks for joining the convo.
---
That's a ridiculous argument.  The issue isn't people being 3 days behind.  The issue is people being 6 months behind.
---
Its worth noting the Wataga Protectron Legendary can not be looted anymore (it explodes) unless I am doing something wrong.
---
On the list I was only surprised by "Bots on Parade", I thought it was a guaranteed Legendary, I can't recall not getting a Legendary in a run so surprised to see it at 2/10 times.  There appears to almost always be a legendary in the gold course hole and houses north of golf club also. 
---
Be right back, about to blow up my sorry excuse for a base and start over.
---
Didn't help him dupe, he duped without me there. I simply helped him transfer that nuka to another character on his account.
---
Everybody's dead Dave. 
---
That isn't your call, now is it?
---
At level 15 you can start to use raider PA theirs a few spawn points in the toxic valley to get a full set from.
---
I personally greatly enjoyed the ‘survival’ experience - always needing to be on my toes in case I cross paths with another player, sticking to the treelines, etc.
---
But the leaderboard system as-is just makes every life an inevitable wait until you WILL die and lose a significant amount of caps. The only way to offset this loss is to completely change your priorities and go on the offensive against other players, and while this is definitely a gratifying playstyle for some, it I feel it all but eliminates the other 99% of the game itself. 
---
I would much rather keep on surviving for as long as I can with that ever-present element of tension, without everyone on the server knowing your location every ~45 minutes and your inevitable death on this fairly consistent loop. There are already systems in place for people who want to seek out PvP (Hunter/Hunted, player hubs, etc.), so why eliminate the survival-adventure experience for everyone else?
---
I agree. All these new skins make me actually want to buy atoms lol
---
I understand their point about, that's literally the point of survival mode. But unfairly marking people minding their own business while they level up in a dangerous environment....you know survive is kinda bad. Top three should be for player kills....you know raiders.  Not Joe blow farming meds so he can be top.raider next time.
---
I played it yesterday just to try, and overall, i prefer PvE.  You are right about not being able to do quests or WS runs etc...its more like king of the hill than survival which would be fine, but from what i hear the rewards are pitiful.
---
Im not motivated to play just to see myself on a leader-board...show me a sweet prize for holding onto the top spot.
---
Like maybe a list of legendary items to choose from depending how long you stay on top.
---
I think you deserve it Did not you think it was suspicious? 
---
Working as intended.  Just super rare!
---
/Faschnacht
---
emos are the definition of edgy. 
---
Toxic Troll
---
It shows an icon next to their name if they are on a survival server.
---
Yeah I know it's a beta. I'm just saying that unless it changes people will have big problems with it. Let's hope they do change things that need changing.
---
Thanks for joining the convo. 
---
I didn't care if it was or not. I was just helping a friend.
---
Yea I knew I lost some.  Really didn't care I dont use them for leveling.  Again I'm not whining about losing anything.  I'm saying that at a timed event how is anyone supposed to accomplish anything?  I think it's stupid but that's just me.  but like I said good luck to you guys in there. 
---
I agree with this Survival &gt; deathmatch
---
Lovely, thanks!
---
I agree these things are usually made or broken by the people that participate in them....
---
I like that idea, however for a true survival experience it should be separated imo. Now it is very easy to obtain everything you need in adventure mode and then continue in survival.
---
Collectively, I lost 4k in caps, 150 diluted stims, chems, food, water, my ego, patience, and ammo. Unless your running sentinel assassins or caveliers assassins type armors, chances are you are not fairing 100 % against foes. I didn't like the drop rate of my loot and double cap loss is a killer at lvl 175. 350 per death sucked, hence there's a lot of new lower lvl God rolling foes as you eloquently put it.
---
Shouldn't have helped your friend dupe
---
Well, I hated the game at launch. And honestly, it is what it matters, is that the game at launch is smooth, at least for reviews and journalists/content creators. The launch time is where a game makes it's mark in the industry, and Bethesda failed miserably. People weren't full of shit, the game sucked really bad when it launched. 
---
Now the game is a stellar experience. The thing is that the launch reviews will stay, and the game will be marked as a bad game in the future. Honestly, I hope this affects sales for games, I am kinda sick of getting to pay 60 bucks for half-assed games, hoping they get properly patched. This is a mentality that started with Early Access. They saw that people would not mind to pay for broken games in development, and that they eventually would stick around. At least in Early Access, we would know what we would get. Now, publishers are just releasing unfinished games as a final product.
---
This is the equivalent of you buying a car, and you only get the engine first. Then the seller says "oh but if you wait around, you will get the rest of it, and have a fully working car, trust me!" You get mad. But as the months go by, you receive the wheels, the chassis, etc. At the end, you get a freakin Ferrari. Yeah, you get the end product, but you don't fully enjoy it from the start. And yeah, some people who would pay for a car, and only receive the engine would feel scammed, and spit out bad stuff about the company.  
---
Sounds like you want last laugh all the time.
---
I’m just trying to make it easier for you to get the things you need. There is a Sub Reddit called Fallout market and that’s where you can find anything you need for cheap. 
---
Hard disagree.
---
The wiki says it is a vault in Utah, so they will either have to change the lore or change the number
---
Matchmaking is a common pvp mechanic..I mean at least in the few pvp games I've played.
---
There is only 1 and his name is Wooby and he is currently sealed away in the dev rooming sorting all the items in there until its his time to shine.
---
Awesome, thank you both for the insight. 
---
Yeah its broken.  You can stay at a station and kill everyone loading in.  Surprised people aren't moving caps and aids to another character, I'm getting up to 140 stimpacks at a time, etc.
---
Read the other comment, he knew it was from duping. It's like if someone gets caught transporting illegal drugs for someone else: "I was just transporting them officer, I'm not part of the problem"
---
" Didn't help him dupe, he duped without me there. I simply helped him transfer that nuka to another character on his account. "
---
I agree the game isn't AS BAD as people made it to be. That's not to say it wasn't a botched launch, and if you just started playing recently you fortunately didn't see the worst of it , it was mostly performance/stability which ruined this game for a lot of people. The game looks really outdated compared to other AAA games on the market . I love the ida and concept behind fallout 76 some of the designs i hope improve , ill continue to play the game and hope/wait to see it reach it's full potential , that's all up to how committed bethesda is to making this game great though. 
---
One of the big positives for me and i hope i'm right is since they are owned by zenimax and they saw how you can turn a very bad launch (Elder Scrolls Online) into a product that is much better and even growing now so they will do the same here (hopefully).
---
I'm believe Beth doesn't understand how long it takes to zone in 
---
That's called helping him
---
I said "I'll support em with my caps once they make the game what I want it to be", and they released absolutely amazing survival mode, they gotta get my caps.
---
Learn where the gym locations are in the world and loot the scrappable lead. Make sure you have both ammosmith and super duper on when crafting. GL HF
---
Before you left the vault did you forget your helmet ... Once again why go to a PVP server in a game you just got knowing there will be others higher level then you take the time to come here and cry .... cheer up butter cup your booty cheeks wont be tight for long
---
On Xbox at least there was a mod for it in FO 4. However it got very buggy with Nuka World. Had to uninstall. Not sure if it got fixed but it was nice not having to scroll through a ton of keys. 
---
Are you on ps4? if so i can make you a load of civil war hats that sell for 31 caps each (with hard bargain maxed out).  If you supply the cloth i'll make you even more :) 
---
Committing the actual bug itself was against the ToS. Not transferring items.
---
Above watoga there is a power station that has 1 legendary glowing overgrown ant and a deathclaw and like 4 other ants
---
Other PVP games use a leveling technique where you can only PVP people +/- 10 levels of you. I dont see why that couldnt be enacted here.
---
I had a lvl 45 .308 LMG with Furious and Anti Armour before the TSE patch, damage per round was actually reasonable (I was a non-VATs pistol build), but on auto it just annihilated everything.
---
Wish I'd known I could get a Prime for it, might have kept it rather than handing it off.
---
I might come back once all the content in the roadmap is out. Then again I probably won't lol
---
Even though only one of each kind can be active at a time...
---
He’s not saying it’s his call, just that he agrees with the punishment.
---
Disable legendaries in Survival and make respawn zones safe where players take no PVP damage.  Fixed.
---
Hopefully things will be changed, it is only a beta atm which I'm sure EVERYONE will love to make a comment about but atm its like if I ran a car company irl and every car had a 98% to explode when you started it then I'd be bankrupt and in jail for making a terrible and dangerous car. Atm survival is an annoying, boring and down right pointless waste of time. 
---
Still a part of the same process. 
---
A get-away driver didn't actually commit the crime, but they helped enable it.
---
The people whining are the asshole griefers that were "roleplaying a raider".  Now that they are getting monkeystomped by other epople, they don't like it.
---
They never wanted a fair fight.  They wanted to kill and destroy CAMPs without consequence.
---
They are getting a taste of their own medicine now.  They thought they were Billy Badass until they found the people that *really* wanted open PVP and were the real Billy Badasses.
---
And with slap damage reduced to 0 and the incoming update where they can't destroy CAMPs at will, they are going to be whining even harder or they are going to quit.
---
It's easy to grief.  It's harder to fight fair.
---
Reword your statement, that isn't helping him actually dupe. That's helping him transfer duped items.
---
I am on on ps4 actually and you'd have no idea how much i appreciate that 
---
Yea can’t wait to get home. Take my leverage 2shot explosion i bought from a sexy level 3 yesterday and troll the shit out of this train wreck of a game. 
---
Still shitting on you. Made a new character for survival last night. Got killed once. Had a blast.
---
Haha yeah awesome mate looking forward to it :) im gunna farm a load of stimpaks today ready for it, whats your psn?
---
True. Imo there should be no crossover at all. If i wanted to play PvP i would not mind making a new character for that. 
---
It still isn't against the ToS though, so therefore your analogy is incorrect.
---
Anyone else get an oddly high bounty put on them? Someone put a 6,000+ cap bounty on me although it may have been part of some scheme as there was a second player that showed up.
---
It is helping him by enabling him to do so.
---
The only builds oneshotting me are vats crit, thats the only problem i see really. Its really cheesy to just press the autoaim and killsomeone, sure you can go around that with a stealth boy but its just lame in the first place. 
---
The Spawn system is fucked thats true, but if you out of caps you can just respawn at your camp, which is ideally not near a Train station or vault 76.
---
Lets just hope they improve the overall gamemode overtime ! :-)
---
 In the second I tried to charge the shot, someone naked came and killed me in one fell swoop. 
---
F76 is one of the biggest games with the least amount of information. Trying to look something like that is up like pulling teeth, man. ESO was like that too, and even now most info comes from streamers
---
What legendaries do you have for swords?
---
Whitesprings gets nuked 9/10 times anyways. Unless you can nuke vault 76, I dunno you'd need to change it. 
---
Aside from the game lore of the Scorched plague mutating/killing everything basically players other than yourself are considered NPC's of 76
---
This forever and ever amen.  
---
If you're on pc it's probably because you have textures too high. Before i got my rtx 2060 i was playing on a 970 trying high textures because medium looked terrible especially on guns/weapons with print on them and it was chewing through all of vram and then some sometimes going up to 5.5gn in bigger cities.
---
They can kill you before lv 5 in survival.
---
Alright, I'm still getting my ass kicked at watoga. Good news is I got 1346 caps, bad news is no vendors have caps anymore and I'm getting attack by glowing dogs and high level mirelurks, mirelurks kings, and packs of feral ghouls that are legendary and level 50+. They're wiping out my base that has 10 turrets, all with overlapping fields of fire (leaving no blind spots anywhere, all the way up to the foundations of my base) and they bust through the fence I got set up to keep them at a distance for the turrets to do work in seconds.
---
moldy\_poncho is my psn. I'll hop on now for you.
---
Psssst go to flatwoods and gather all the soot flower and blood leaf you can find. I can sell 40healving salves for 200caps to each vendor. It should help get you back on your feet while looking for people to trade with 😊.
---
At the end of the day, those nukas are off my account. This isn't a ban, our accounts are frozen. I'm well aware that I'm guilty, I'm literally just trying to figure out when we're coming back, because it WILL happen.
---
"I found a nitty gritty loophole to let me be part of the people ruining the game"
---
I hope you stay banned
---
Good idea
---
Survival mode shoukd lose whatever weapon you have equipt on death aswell as aid and junk, so if you are using your best weapon when you die, its gone
---
I was so bummed, I didnt have time to participate until yesterday and thought it would still be running so all afternoon I looked around town but never found the event.. Feeling dejected I left and went on my way and thought "oh well guess I missed out on the event items..." What was interesting was while exploring outside Whitesprings, I actually got 3 Fasnacht masks that were loot in containers! Woot for me! So while I missed the fun with everyone, at least I have some of the rare masks.
---
It can go either way I suppose. I ignored complaints and criticism aswell, and not to say I didn't enjoy the game at all but wow did 76 disappoint. It would need so much added content for me to even consider going back. And I know for a fact my friends are never returning so even then we'll have to see. The only saving grace I can think of is that anthem is even less enjoyable somehow. 
---
Keep telling yourself that
---
Oh I fully intend on giving back to the new players, I just need to get to the high levels first. Then I can run around throwing good gear at people, while shouting "LET ME LOVE YOU" 
---
As much as Bethesda has mentioned that they’re trying to limit the possibility of people being “one shot” in PvP I’ve found that TSE lever action and gauss rifles still manage to do the job, for now anyways. Even if they’ve got some good armor (assuming it’s not a AS/SNT set) you can knock them down in a couple shots :)
---
It exists. A level 50 scorchbeast dropped it for me last night.
---
" Due to this, the account’s access to Fallout 76 has been frozen until such time as all duplicated items can be removed from the account.  Once the fix is live and confirmed, we will reactivate this account and notify you that you are able to access the game again. "
---
what part of it not being a ban don't you get?
---
What I hope is they just either rename/remake it to what it actually is and that's a death match or they give it a big overhaul because it desperately needs it. 
---
C.A.M.P.s in general should receive a massive buff in survival mode, somebody shouldn't be able to easily blow their way through brick and steel walls.
---
If you're on pc shoot me a friend request ascott38
---
You're missing the point. Even when I swapped to X-01, and had resists close to 600/600 it made little difference. There's a balancing issue here.
---
I picked it up from a static plan spawn location, although I'm not going to say where because I don't want it to go the way of the Nuka Quantum paint. I will say that while it's just laying there it's not easy to see as it's hidden behind a workbench.
---
That’s what I figured lol. I was hopping this thread would become the list. Post the ones you know and let’s hope others follow suit. 
---
Have been saying this for a while. I'm level 225, pvp is not worth it for me. Some level 60 can kill me once and I'd have to kill him 4 times just to break even
---
Okey ? I have to check it 
---
I will be 5 minutes bud
---
I mean could make it happen
---
Praise adam
---
I never listen to just one persons opinion not everyone likes the same things, even if it's a review who usually likes what i do i usually form my opinion off of a few others. It's idiotic to see a youtuber post something and immediately think hes 100% correct. Fallout in general isn't for everyone and then you add not only multiplayer but different gameplay loops from fallout 4 which to a lot of die hard people was considered a bad game. I actually loved fallout 4 far harbor was some of the best dlc for a game ina  long time along with the witchers dlc's.
---
The gear is eng based drops. To say everyone with good gear duped it is nonsense.
---
These are people that invested time into acquiring perks and cards and mutations and min-maxing their builds. They have a head start even if they are forced to restart. They will be dropping nukes constantly and farming legendaries. Hell I've just started farming legendaries and have a few decent ones.
---
There are problems. Static spawn points, and invulnerability doesn't work at some stations, and a general balance pass on weapons and gear.
---
Im not feeling it..not due to other peeps' builds or weapons, but mostly because....whats the reward??  if i hold the top spot for an hour or so, I should be rewarded with a list of legionaries to choose from...They can make it work, but need a reason to play...+20% exp doesn't cut it, and  from what i hear, the stuff you may get is a joke like those fatsnatch masks...lol
---
He's saying I'll hopefully never get banned, but it isn't a ban. And he can agree all he wants, it's still not a ban, and it's still not his call for how long I stay suspended for.
---
To be fair, they did list this as a beta. So there is definitely room for improvement. We shall have to wait and see.
---
Wow, survival sounds terrible so far.
---
You should be mad at your friend instead of Bethesda. Have your friend buy you a new game with all the money he made selling shit on Ebay. 
---
Yeah, but double check that.  Sometimes the system gets the dots confused.  I don't know how many times I've messaged someone through their dot and it was actually someone else halfway across the map and I get a "What you talking about" reply.
---
Useful to know! I may have to rethink my cowboy hat if I try Survival :) Thanks!
---
Oh I know its real life folklore, but this is the first I have seen it in Virginia (not West Virginia).
---
 "Due to this, the account’s access to Fallout 76 has been frozen until such time as all duplicated items can be removed from the account.  Once the fix is live and confirmed, we will reactivate this account and notify you that you are able to access the game again. "
---
I don't have to tell myself anything, Bethesda told me what it is already.
---
Right?
---
So much this
---
I found early game (I'm level 23) I just made a basic camp with a the crafting benches, a bed for well rested and stash box and I just pay to move it where ever I'm exploring and just kew returning there to stash items and scrap stuff. 
---
But listening to the old music and the raider salvaging/scrapping old junk gameplay helps to adjust playing on fo76 multiplayer's vintage engine.
---
Atm I can make tick-blood tequila, White Russians, champagne and I do know that you can get some of the named beers as recipes like the pickaxe pilsner etc. I really want to open a massive brewery haha.
---
I had lots of fun too. Created a new character, got killed once by a high level but that was it. Afterwards I only found people my level. I got in a firefight with one guy but greeded and stayed with my claimed loot. A few minutes later he snuck up on me and got revenge!
---
Also found a friendly person who helped with an event. Very fun and tense, because you dont want to turn your back on then if they changed their mid/acting to earn my trust. Makes it more wholesome when it works too because mutual trust is needed, which is nice.
---
Prime example of how shitty this community is ^ thank you lol. 
---
suspended\*
---
I realized that a long time ago
---
Na, let's keep the 10 am update time so it updates while I'm at work XD
---
But once again, that's not your call, now is it?
---
But the leaderboard system as-is just makes every life an inevitable wait until you WILL die and lose a significant amount of caps. The only way to offset this loss is to completely change your priorities and go on the offensive against other players, and while this is definitely a gratifying playstyle for some, I feel it all but eliminates the other 90% of the game itself.

There are already systems in place for people who want to seek out PvP (Hunter/Hunted, player hubs, etc.), so why eliminate the high-risk-adventure experience for everyone else?
---
no probs
---
I believe many people at Beth don't understand a lot of things about actually playing the game.  :)
---
Where is this old mow place? Not Big Maw right ?
---
So what are the effects of the tequila, Russian, and champagne? 
---
I mean, you literally helped your friend cheat. Right? Just because he cheated harder than you doesn’t mean you both aren’t cheaters.
---
Personally, I can’t stand when people exploit cheats in online games. If it’s a single-player game, go apeshit. But when you cheat in a multiplayer online game, it’s just making it less fun and more unfair for the people who play by the rules.
---
If you have to cheat at a game in order to enjoy it, you might want to just play something else. That’s just my two cents.
---
I’m not positive but something is definitely buggy with the paints. Another user [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5woe6/new_atomic_shop_bug/) about being able to use the Wasteland Walker paint on T-51b without buying it, but it doesn’t apply to the helmet.
---
I have 2 other accounts. Playing the game isn't the issue lmfao
---
I never listen to anyone honestly, I’m one of those “I’ll see for myself,” type people. 
---
I've never found a single Assassin's/Cav or Sent either. I've found other 2* and 3* Assassin's pieces and even Cav or Sent pieces but never together. I think it's incredibly rare or possibly not in game any longer.
---
I literally just want my PvP character back because ppl need to get punched in the face for messing with my friends all the time.
---
"*Florida* Man who lived..."   FTFY
---
Nah 
---
I would like the concept if we had a mode where we stripped down armor and weapon perks and went to straight damage and resistance. Would level the field.  Perk cards untouched because these are really a strategy to have listed right where as armor and weapons are based on how deep your pockets are and if you somehow obtain rare items which I personally have the worst luck. 
---
If you hold the top spot for an hour+ it should give you a quest to go to a special vendor where you can buy extremely rare ANYTHING that has a super tiny drop chance in the game BUT everyone on the map gets notified and you have to scramble to get to the vendor fast before they all kill you. If you don't make it you should still get something but obvs you will have missed out on the Vendor.

This was happening any time I exited or entered PA. So I compensated by making sure I was equipped after a clothing change. Last night, it was happening randomly. Sometimes I was fully equipped and sometimes I wasn't. It's a pain to have to check every few minutes, especially when the shit is already spraying out of the fan.
---
All the vendors have 0 caps for me. I have to wait for the refresh. But thanks for the tip
---
Like, even the normal purified water/ammo jank rewards are rare too? Thats super lame. 
---
I know, they don’t spawn legendaries. It was a joke of how bad my gear is 😂
---
Apparently these people ain't used to games where you actually risk stuff being lost of you die... Like, you ever pvp'd in RuneScape or for in Minecraft? You lose everything... Stop whining and git gud. It's just a game, an optional mode at that..
---
So your "friend" or alt was just trying to circumvent the ban by transferring duped items to you. You got caught and are now banned. Why would they ever reinstate your account? You have a choice. Buy the game again and start afresh or play something else. In legal speak you're an accessory to the crime and equally guilty.
---
Klirbyni, has this one since the launch of ps3. I really need to change it.
---
I am not gettin involved in Survival for stuff like this.
---
Okay, and he’s still not saying it’s his call. And as for ban vs. suspension...bottom line is you still can’t play right now, so you’re kind of arguing semantics 
---
Ooooh that's too good.
---
*drops 1 salt in doggie bag
---
Sounds like a decent idea.
---
What do you mean? one of each kind of what?
---
It’s called ‘open world’ for a reason :) the world is open to explore. If you don’t like the lower levels in a certain just hop servers. They have as much entitlement as anyone else 
---
So true. Why am I using spreadsheets to track stuff that should be in my pip-boy?
---
Me helping a friend get things from one character to another has nothing to do with what I did to level my character and get my own gear. And even at the end of the day, most dupers are completely trash at this anyway.
---
100% this game NEEDS a shared stash
---
I hope you stay indefinitely suspended...
---
There... I never said banned... 
---
Apologies, edited post to make it more obvious what it was. 
---
Starting fresh will not fix anything unless you must start fresh each time you die.
---
Survival mode is not supposed to be easy, if you die at spawn....change where you spawn next time.
---
Bloodied sentinels are vulnerable, exploit them.
---
Don’t take loads of aid with you. Just 5 stims and some basic food rations. Pick up the rest while out in the wild.
---
Carry a good NPC weapon (eg instagating)
---
Carry a hard hitting other weapon and use VATS to target limbs to stop them attacking back giving you time to hide.
---
Use Chameleon armor or mutation to keep stealthy
---
Carry 1 stealth boy so you can get away if you need to
---
Be aware of your surroundings by not just sprinting through open ground or making loads of noise with unsilenced weapons
---
Cause they  aren't charging for any additional content to the game. It may seem steep to you and many others. But it's incredibly reasonable to many others as well. When you think about it, some people paid 30 bucks for this game and have over 400 hours or so into it. I play incredibly casually and still have 180 hours including the Beta. To me, dropping 20 bucks on top of the price of the game for a collection of skins is okay by me. It's really what you're into. I personally only buy weapon and armor skins from the shop. And the odd thing for my camp. I would never spend real money on a pose or photo frame. But I wouldn't care if someone else did. It's their money and to them , it's worth it. 
---
Why ya'll niggas so butt hurt for, tho? No one is out here asking for opinions on why people should stay banned, it's literally just a "Hey, duped items aren't on my account atm, when are ya'll reinstating us?" type of a thread.
---
As a PvP oriented person I agree with my fellow wastelander on this one.
---
It doesn’t disappear when it explodeds, it flies up in the air and probably lands where you can’t see it. It does this depending on how much damage you do at once. If you are one shotting it with a high power weapon it ups the chances of it exploding. 
---
Bank with an auction house attached would be amazing. kill 2 birds with one stone. 3 really because that would no doubt become the unofficial player hub.
---
It's all ugly af but I agree
---
Make sure you go to the faction vendors as well like the raider one and the brotherhood one. There's the ones in the stations, white springs, enclave, brotherhood, raiders (dunno about others) and then the wondering ones like Grahm and the responders not. Giving you the possibility of making about 1200 caps a day so you'd need about 200+ healing salves but with the green thumb perk every one flower gives you 2 meaning all you need need to do is find 100 of each flower which I know for a fact you can find just about enough around the flatwoods area. 
---
They combine tech data in the inventory... Why can't they combine keys/notes?
---
Oh... Then again they'd probdbly fuck it up and combine other things accidentally so we'd all have single rounds of ammo
---
Weird bugged quest. Contrary to what the objectives say, during the final wave, you have to have at least 1 mirelurk reach the island. It will then summon a queen. Objectives will update saying you have to kill it, do so, then you'll be able to get rewards
---
You knew your buddy was duping though. And so you waited till the duping was done, then swooped in to help him cover it up and get away with it.
---
That’s like if your friend sells a bunch of drugs, and then you wait for the drugs to all be sold, and then you help him launder the money so no one finds out.
---
Deathclaws, they drop a lot of them. Deathclaw island if you're new, abandoned waste dump if you're not. Corpses around the cranberry bog fissure sites if you can handle scorchbeasts. . . and of course the Queen fight where lots of everything pop up too.
---
Why is everyone so worried about getting their base deleted? Mine never gets deleted? 
---
\*in before it gets deleted\*
---
That's exactly why I havent gone over there yet.
---
stimpack. You can't spam them. I'm not sure what your point is on the amount of stims people have.
---
Yeah I noticed that too , a bug maybe 
---
 (╯°□°）╯︵ sǝlqɐʇʇɔǝdsǝɹslԀ

Top floor of Watoga Emergency Services always has a crowned leader enemy and is 50/50 if it is legendary or not. It is 1 of 4 enemies. Super mutant, glowing one, scorched leader or wendigo. 
---
yup. this game unfortunately faced some VERY early character assassination. It's not a perfect game and I have gripes with it, but I love it all the same.
---
Super Mutants? Dang that’s weird. I’ve been there 30+ times and only ghouls and insects spawn.
---
I had a guy yesterday in the same area, we ran into each other and said hi. Then I kept hearing him whistling and I noped the hell out of there lol Maybe I watch too much horror but abandoned town, whistling stranger? Never ends well. 
---
It was a sarcastic remark, a poor attempt at a joke using Bethesda's limited response to the Faschnacht event criticisms.  Like Todd's "It just works!" of old.
---
I do not do the Suitors event because it appears to be bugged.  And because I don't go into the Toxic Valley often.
---
The issue is people being 6 months behind + dupers + xp glitch + non-balanced servers.
---
I don't mind facing someone with better gear, but if day 1 people come with perfect stuff and impossible to reach level (allowing them to have all perk cards at any rank) , being level 10 or level 90 won't change much , I'm screwed if I played legit.
---
Lol. You get banned for duped items. They were removed, and you expect your account to be reinstated. "Honestly judge, I  just disposed of the gun and his body. I didn't do no wrong."
---
Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra Town
---
That's the thing, he just asked me to help transfer stuff. I didn't know what it was going to be, it just so happened to be nuka lmfao
---
I have not seen him in Months, myself.
---
RNG just rolls lucky a few times it seems.
---
Damn dude that pad is hella swanky, great job!
---
Yeah its just forced pvp when everyone has only a few spawnpoints and ppl are shown on the map when surviving a given amount of time. 
---
It should feel like dayz, dont show anyone on the map, enable all spawn points and remove vats for player targeting. Thats what im hoping for at least.
---
Beta boy here, definitely a hard beginning but they have fixed a majority of the old bugs like duplication, slender man power armor, etc
---
Picture show pump shotgun?
---
 "Due to this, the account’s access to Fallout 76 has been frozen until such time as all duplicated items can be removed from the account.  Once the fix is live and confirmed, we will reactivate this account and notify you that you are able to access the game again."
---
Like how are you people still so sure that this is a ban when the email says otherwise?
---
How about instead they leave it a quagmire for moronic PvP people and go back to fixing the game they keep breaking.  Siphons off trolls AND they fix their game and release more content.  Win win
---
Forced PvP isn't enjoyable. If I have to defend myself until I die, I'm just going to kill myself at my camp when I get close to third place, then grab my bag. Right now, first place rotates through every person on the server, so the hunted don't always want to fight everyone on the server until they die. If I can attempt to hunt down players who have shown they can defend themselves against wave after wave, then it'll be enjoyable for everyone involved.
---
I also don't understand this mentality of people in survival "exploiting" extra XP, like they're taking something from someone, or detracting from anyone's fun. If people want to PvP, there are plenty of mechanics to make that possible and easy to do. Forcing players, who are there for higher stakes adventuring without PvP restrictions, into an arbitrary new battle royale mechanic, is just going to make people find ways to circumvent the current design. Especially without any reward. 
---
Haha all good mate id like to change mine aswell tbf
---
I saved up 5-4 extra points. Is that why it isn't showing in Luck for me??
---
Yeah I get all that but there will always be multiple someone's who makes it there mission to hunt down players and instakill them or small groups who will spawn camp as many places as they can so after you spawn and you brief invulnerability wears off they kill you again. People are dicks and will always find a way to ruin stuff. 
---
Bloodied melee is the current BIG DAMAGE build. Some people use two hand weapons, highest damage. But most people go for one hand weapons with swing speed. Highest dps.
---
It’s very annoying having to climb to the roof and look for the 3* robot I just sent into space. 
---
Then I guess you just caught a bad case of “guilty by association.” Tough break, but in the long run it’s still making the game more fair for those of us who aren’t cheating. Whether we’re aware of it or not.
---
That's the thing, he just asked if I could help transfer, I ain't know it was gonna be nuka lmfao
---
LMAO FUCK!! I knew exactly what you meant the second I read the title. 10/10 post.
---
It should be made into a safe zone. Someone on the outside cannot shoot into it. And someone inside doesn’t do any damage at all. When they leave the zone, the have a temporary debuff on pvp damage and received damage. To counteract the fact that people will probably then just start camping outside of the safe zone.
---
nvm this then, seems like its as stupid as the single action :(
---
shame
---
I’ve heard that from some other people too. I’ll check it out when I get in later. Thanks for the info!
---
I was thinking tent before I saw your comment haha
---
Maybe in 2001.
---
To be honest it crossed my mind but for some reason I decided to use more conservative approach in this particular post
---
It explodes, but most of the time the body lands nearby, you just have to cross your fingers it doesn’t get shoved underground or into other geometry. 
---
TBH it should just be called what it is and that's "Deathmatch" and spawn people in a small radius to slug it out. It kinda feels like they are trying to hide a game mode within another. Either go full DayZ or go full Unreal tournament.
---
Targetting hud makes a red outline. It is definitely NOT the sensory mod. 
---
I hit him multiple times including a critical hit to the head.
---
Yeah but do you believe that your account is top priority? They may get around to it in about three years. In fact I doubt if they'll even bother at all.
---
If white springs wouldn't be nuked so much it could be the perfect playerhub :).
---
They could redesign a part of Charles town capitol building too.
---
Perhaps we could have a thing in our camps we can build like a radar detector thay would alert us to u coming nukes
---
Last night I went into the survival server with some friends and joined their team.  I was on a low level character I’ve been doing a pure shotgun build on, level 34.  I did quests while watching steadily on the map everyone on the team at Whitesprings (and 1 guy hunting the top 3).  In one hour, I gained over 3000 caps by being teamed up (lol), levelled up 3 times running around killing ads, and after about 40 minutes made #1 before getting shot down naked and afraid, running away.  I would say that the 20 mins or so of me being on the top 3 leaderboard was pretty fruitful and it was also incredibly fun and terrifying to watch the others get taken down one by one.  Let me tell you, it’s called survival mode for a reason.  Survival means staying alive, I don’t think you necessarily need to change how you do it or how many people you kill in that time.  
---
This guy gets it.  
---
I’ll check it out later when I get a chance. Thanks for letting me know!
---
IN whitespring I get tons of legendary loot from non legendary ghouls. 
---
I'm 1000000% guilty by association, I even made a post when the wave first happened that I was definitely guilty by association. I'm very realistic on why I got suspended, I literally just would like to know how much more time we might possibly wait.
---
I mute so many people in this game it's ridiculous. From people having convos with people off mic, to pets making noise, to children making a ruckus, people eating, people playing in a long tin can hallway, I could go on all day really.
---
Then don’t hunt people.
---
Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you have to do it.
---
The new character I rolled up for survival mode definitely did not hunt anyone.
---
Can I ask you what you think about the cap loss between a level 50 and a level 300.
---
If it's a fair fight between the two. Why does the level 300 have to lose so much more caps than the level 50.
---
Supposedly quad explosive crossbows do too. Quad crossbows are ok, but you have to reload 4 times.
---
Can I ask a question? What's to stop someone from hiding somewhere in Whitespring Hotel indefinitely to stay at the top of the list? I mean, there is literally millions of places to hide in Chameleon stealth, and the map just shows that you are SOMEWHERE in the Hotel area. 
---
What would be balanced to you? While not trivial to aquire, X-01 is still comparatively easy to good three star armor effects with the correct mods. Making them on the same footing would drastically devalue legendary armor. I don't disagree that one shotting sucks, but armor is not the answer. Frankly I don't know how to fix it either. A damage cap seems unfair to builds like the bloodied ones that take a high risk to be at low health only to reach the same maximum as less risky builds? Nerf two shot explosive even further sure ok but what about anti armor explosive that can ignore something like 70% of your 600DR? Balancing is fucked everywhere BUT the tip top level where one shotting happens. Making less good options better and the very good options worse to me would make for a more bland experience where it doesn't matter if I use a fire cracker or a grenade when they only do a quarter health each max. Sorry for the rant and this isn't really directed to you! I'm frustrated too and I guess I just needed to vent as well lol.
---
Which one?
---
My understanding of the "endgame" is launching a nuke and taking out the scorchbeast queen.
---
You can't launch nukes until you've completing quests generated at locations on the east side of the map (rewards will allow you to gain access to the bunkers from which you  launch the nukes)
---
I've taken my time - 3 months exploring and clearing every site I could find on the western side of the map, a handful of runs through WS nuke zone....
---
L48, and I'm just getting to the center of the Savage Divide - havent been to the bog or the mire at all.  
---
Sounds both of us are a long way from endgame.
---
I believe the marine combat armor is what you want to try and find.  It is supposed to be the strongest non-power armor in the game.  I do not know its rad resistance.
---
  I dont have the 6a/6p perk, so IDK how well it works - I just added the radiation regens health perk last night, so don't now how well that works in a nuke zone either.  I'll figure that out this weekend, at the same time I test the L50  -1000 rad suit I have.
---
If you have not yet been in a nuke zone - they generate some pretty nasty critters - highest I've seen so far was a L91 glowing deathclaw - sometimes en mass (5 level 68 glowing ones at a time is not uncommon in Whitesprings), so high DR and a good weapon are vital.
---
Obviously lots of radiation (I walked into the edge of a zone last weekend - no radx/away, not in PA, and lost 1/2 my health in a matter of seconds.)  back up, PA on, radx, radaway, stimpack.....took about 10 steps, and was attacked by a dozen L68 scorched.  Here the vampire weapon came in, for each hit regenerated some of my health....
---
Although the cultist dagger earned my great respect last night in the wendigo cave...fast, 90 dmg, and takes out L40 mirluck kings in 3-4 hits.  next nuke run I do, I'll try that instead of the vampire machete.
---
But some the critters in the zone drop legendary weapons and armor, which you'll need to fight the queen....or you spend lots of caps buying stuff at vendors.
---
BTW, the batteries included perk drops the weight of all energy weapon ammo - fusion cores are considered ammo - drops them from 3# each to 0.3# each.
---
almost as if anonymous strangers gathering on the internet just breeds toxicity.
---
Also, I can never hear or see the word toxicity without thinking of Systme of a Down.
---
Wait... your talking about the new legendary weapons from survival mode, aren't you?
---
Appolgies. I thought you were a fresh player and was asking about general legendary effects. 
---
I'd love to but the game marks you for death every 30 minutes to an hour and the whole server descends on you!
---
Same old argument in here. "*Don't spend your money on that!*"
---
I didn't spend anything. It was free.
---
this feels like Quake 
---
The armor is whatever. It’s the weapons. 
---
Most decent mics have a switch, as well as some controllers. It's just people have no respect.
---
Yeah, this def is not true. I unlocked all Handmade mods by crafting low level short handmades (15 I think). Last thing to unlock was the suppressor. Now my legendary TS Handmade is a WS silent slayer...
---
Ugh I gotta clean out my stash so I can store all of my aid! 
---
No problem 👌
---
I think players should be able to kill lower leveled players, there should just be penalties for doing so (unless the lower leveled player initiates combat, or is above level 50). I agree overall though, the major issue with survival is balance and the respawn mechanics, not the allowing of characters from advenrure.
---
Better yet , turn the game off to attend family. Family is 1G time more important than some digital dystopia.
---
Maybe, I am running a 1060 8gb though with 16gb DDR4 ram, I'd have thought that was more than enough, 
---
How the fuck do you get that I'm saying I'm a priority? Get your head out of your ass for a second, and just understand that I'm literally asking WHEN IS THE WAVE COMING BACK? Like, idk if you understand how I use the word "wave" but I literally mean everyone, not just me. God damn you're dense lmfao
---
Clearly not enough to know why there are no human NPCs. Your question is invalid.
---
I think the only one I didn’t get the 200 caps from is the enclave vendors. Traveling to one of them now hopefully they have some caps, if not I’ll just buy a cheap plan to sell some stuff. No point of carrying more than 100 caps on you in survival. 
---
High stakes.  High rewards.  Not no stakes, high rewards.  What's there to misunderstand? 
---
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself! I don't think that the experience you had couldn't also be replicated if the system was implemented the way I suggested, though. Especially if you engage in PvP, and someone puts a bounty on you or your friends. Forcing people to be targets isn't really giving options, though, and while "surviving" in this context seems to be what you've taken away from the game mode, I think there are quite a few people who had played Fallout 4, and were expecting a more hardcore mode, not this forced manhunt mode. 
---
r/outside
---
Good thing it's a beta. 
---
Were you in the same general area?  
---
Asking b/c the few times I've seen him were on consecutive days, on the main road between the Mysteries manision and Posiedon.
---
My dailies with Biv came to a grinding halt when I got the daily to make the Tick Blood Tequila. I'm a low level who hasn't even ventured into a nuke zone. 
---
No the invulnerability is bugged right now. It is not nearly as long or just doesn't even work. Don't spawn at stations that's all you have to really know
---
This. I really like the battle hub idea.
---
you've managed to actually have the event do something??
---
Plus everyone already knows it. However you could run into the problem of it getting nuked quite frequently. 
---
If you're on Xbox, I'll hook you up with a mask. I have plenty of repeats.
---
I'll pay you a visit and browse through your wares later today. sending you a friend request, PSN is same as my username here
---
Agreed!!! and it goes without saying, the bank would be a no nuke zone. I always like the idea of once you leave vault 76 and hit level 5 the mr handys inside the vault have cleaned up the after party and made you a shared stash, vendors with higher cap limits (something like 500 nothing too crazy) and an auction house. That way it solves a ton of issues while reusing assets already in the game. Players would naturally flock there making it a player hub, and honestly Vault 76 makes the most sense in game to be a player hub. It would be like a sense of visiting home again.
---
I'm arguing that it isn't a ban. I can literally get on the game right now on 2 other accounts, so that's not semantics at all lmfao
---
that was an amazing episode. they even built a time machine just so they could put buster in a lead fridge in Hiroshima. 
---
What type of camo are there?
---
So if I’ve never played the game before, and I ask a question about it it’s invalid? 
---
It’s a challenge sometimes but yeah. Sometimes I need another person fast travel to force spawns though. 
---
Bethesda is giving out some pretty strong benefits from playing on survival mode.  Those benefits have to have some sort of down-side to balance them.
---
No one is forced into risky situations, because 1) adventure mode exists, and 2) you can hop servers whenever you become #3, or 3) you can suicide when you hit #3 or 4) you can let an NPC kill you when you hit #3 or 5) you can shove everything into your stash and lose almost nothing because we’re talking about a low-level character.
---
I agree, they ruined the game for the rest of us. Bethesda should leave it up to the legitimate players and ask all of us if we want that back in the game to possibly ruin it again. 
---
Glad you got around to it. I havnt played it for ages and I have noticed the changes in players. They arn't nice anymore, and you certainly wont get nice people on this sub. Kill or be killed.
---
Potential fix: make the marker for top 3 and wanted players only show a general radias  for where they are, with the radius updating quicker and smaller the closer to #1 you get. 
---
I spent days looking for him when it was a weekly challenge.....then i fast travel to my camp and hes walking throught it.....
---
The patch notes say there is a period of invulnerability after you have fast travelled or respawned. 
---
I had 3000+ atoms saved up from dailies and weeklies, just for these surprise bundles.
---
I have to disagree with this. The system seems designed the way it is specifically so that someone cant just hide on a survival server and get more xp without engaging in the purpose of that server, which is the pvp. If it wasnt based on the timer, people would fly under the radar and basically play adventure but with the benefits of survival, and less of the risk of it.
---
You aren't wrong
---
Yeah I have been spending caps on things I never used to buy. 
---
Rule #1 of any successful multiplayer game is that you have to design your game so a few assholes can't easily break it for everyone else. Bethesda hard failed at that with FO76. 
---
I believe you are missing the point. I feel that allowing the op pre existing characters in this new mode was a mistake. They should have made it to where it must be started with a new character. I understand that people will always be at a disadvantage. But that much of one right off the bat as the beta comes out isn't smart. 
---
Anyone got a picture of full heavy metal and leather armor with the new camo paint?
---
100% true but it makes the mode feel like an arcade gamemode which isn't what people wanted.
---
Speaking of PA my left arm for my t51 just went missing yesterday as I was playing my God if my torso with jetpack goes missing goodbye Fallout 76 after 950 hours I would be done 
---
Melee builds go stealthboy + assassin / cavalier, if they're properly geared (and pneumatic on the chest piece, to reduce staggers). . . or at least that's the goal. Didn't know about sentinel not working while crouched, thanks.
---
Thanks, I’ll try that next time. I’ve killed the queen with no rewards before but then again it seems completely bugged so I’ll try it again. 
---
I never said you were a priority. I said the devs won't have your "issue" as a top priority. Wave? You mean those accounts frozen for cheating? If I'm dense then what does that make you? A fuck up and a dumbass methinks.
---
agreed 
---
Not easier 
---
I actually thought about that too. I managed to hide in Fort Defiance from two guys in power armour for about fifteen minutes. They genuinely just got tired of looking for me and left.
---
Having said that, you're pretty much stuck there doing nothing as if you start to move around you're done for. Also, if someone has enough explosives to throw into every room... :/
---
Idk why I didn’t think about this small detail before, but what you just said blew my mind. It’s very possible our descendants migrated to Boston and their descendants will be the npcs “Blue” encounters. 
---
It’s completely semantics in regards to the account that got suspended though. But I’m getting bored with this, so good luck.
---
I used it on automatic shotgun and it worked. Probably some bug
---
Some of the people playing weren’t around in pre beta or launch when the No npc was stated. 
---
have tried to do this event so many times.   fast travel to it, fast travel near by and walk to it.  I just walk straight to the island, and nothing happens.  
---
have had ppl do it with me, by my self, with randoms, with teams.   nothing.
---
(I had to boot my game up to check)
---
The tequila does: Melee attacks replenish hunger but may infect you with a disease. 
---
The White Russian does: reduced limb damage by 20%
---
And the champagne does: increases falling speed, reduced radiation damage 
---
And we are getting all the dlc for this game for free. Would you rather they charge for that instead? I'd rather they charge for cosmetic shit and give us free content then charge for dlcs personally
---
I like that thought, almost like a jury of players where you can, as long as you have a good standing as a player, participate in a case by case situation for each banned player. It could have a 10 atomic point incentive as long as you take at least 2 minutes to consider (that way you can't just hyper farm points and you'll actually have think about it instead of presumed guilt)
---
Where's the vtu suit plan
---
I agree, not just idiots eating but anyone who has an open mic and doesn't use headphones. I have muted so many players on PC and thought with the PtT being added that would be gone, boy was I wrong. Please just use push to talk.
---
Dude, it was a poorly worded joke. LatePhilosophy said he couldn't see anything in the pictures; so I said the camo is really good. Like so good you can't see the guy in the picture. It's not actually that good. You can see people who are wearing the camo skins. 
---
I didn't buy the pack, but I think it is desert and forest camo. 
---
I understand your points however it feels like 5k+ is clearly a massively increased price. I’ve seen people trying to sell items for real money and not just caps, it’s turning into pay to win unfortunately.
---
In the challenges section there is a challenge for learning all the new alcohol recipes and lists each one but the only way to know the effect of them is to get them or find someone who has them
---
Wasn't trying to be negative  I think the feedback will help but I get the feeling ( not you) that some don't understand what beta is
---
That's nuts! xD Really, when you jumped my stomach did a backflip ;D
---
yeah but it feels like when I first started playing FO76 and could get to level 50 in 3 weeks. Now it takes 3 month almost. get well rested and eat some cranberries and it's 30% extra exp.
---
This comment has no purpose, I just wanted to share the irony that Survival exp is just launch exp with a headache.
---
And do all your quests slow. Immerse. Good luck
---
Anyone got a spare death mask pc hit me up plz will buy (username same) :D
---
How sad. You fucked up. My heart bleeds.
---
Or just not in Appalachia. Something about giant flying bats will kill the housing market for some. 
---
Yes, because literally 100% of the accounts suspended are guilty. Ya'll kill me with this. Bethesda has been fucking up with this game since day one, and ya'll really believe everyone on that wave was justified in being suspended. Like, no, god forbid if Bethesda made enough mistakes to reach double digits, but the second it's this ya'll all think they can't possibly fuck something up. 
---
Ahhh! I knew he was sought after but didn't realise that was why. Thank you!
---
Mine counted while standing in the middle of the graveyard. Good luck!
---
Well now you know that with just a couple plants you can make a cheap healing salve that can be used to get decent caps for minimal effort. 
---
Thanks! It's nice to see such a supportive community!
---
I'm on PC sadly but it's okay. I'm only
---
Dumbass
---
War it never changes
---
Same here me and a friend killed like 5 originally we thought must only count if you got final hit but when we ended up 1 and 0 7 later we figured something must be wrong D:
---
 War. War never changes... 
---
I server hopped like mad trying to get the asylum outfits and in roughly 100 visits to fort defiance I had 1 level 42 3* bloodbug. Never had a legendary ghoul
---
Now, pvp on survival lol, went from 16k to maxed in 2 hours yesterday lol 
---
What’s annoying to me is someone that thinks a lvl 5 should keep up with a lvl 200. I mean, really?  
---
+karma
---
yep, that was my plan if I ever tried that mode. I wouldn't bother with Radaway or stimpacks.. drink water, gunt for food, find decontamination arches (or cure it another way), wear health regenerating armors, etc. 
---
This. Damage normalization is a pretty basic concept and has been used quite effectively in games like Destiny. 
---
The hero of District 42!
---
Can you play the game right now? Erm...No you can't, sounds like a ban to me even if it is a "temporary" ban.
---
Think it's actually you who doesn't know what a ban is
---
As a parent of a now adult child this comment made me laugh, thank you.
---
So don’t let yourself get to #3.  Change servers, die to an NPC, or unload everything into your stash when you reach #3.
---
Again, without this you can be 99.9% safe in survival mode, and that’s not a balance to the benefits.
---
Yeah I got no ill will with any of this. I'm not pissed about anything I'm just trying to discuss things and hopefully have a decent convo which can help people understand 😊
---
Oh that is useful. I saw some posts that said there was a cooldown somewhere between 200-400hr a player. So this shows the status of the silos per server?
---
This was supposed to be entertaining? And thanks for the luck, but we both know it's only a matter of time.
---
Only way I can think of to hide away my caps is to give them to a friend or a mule character. Anything else I am missing?
---
But that's not the case here is it. You've admitted what you did and now your accounts frozen. Bethesda got this right and are in no hurry to reinstate offenders
---
I don't have the plan but someone on here was kind enough to make one for me when I gave them the materials. It looks really cool. 
---
The plan is super rare and spawns randomly. I know one location for it can be in Harpers Ferry. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qnI1jRMbPY
---
Hope this helps!
---
Haha. I've got a daily mission from Biv to do. If I get a new recipe I'll post it here with what it does. 
---
Place is pretty swanky, great job!
---
Because if a user loses that OP armor or favorite weapon things will hit the fan at an intensifying rate.
---
There’s a workshop in the mire forgot what the name was called that has those wood logs you could put an extractor on. Not sure about random places though. 
---

I still don't understand how this is seen as detrimental in any way. You want to PvP out in the open, I'm all for it. I'm saying that it should be encouraged as an option, not forced on players who have no desire to throw themselves against people who are hundreds of levels higher, with best in slot gear. The risk of running into other players, who could still kill you and take your bag, would still be possible. You could still go and hunt down bounties, or camp train stations like you already are, but people who just want the high stakes gameplay without the arbitrary rules won't have to kill themselves right before they hit the leaderboard to save caps and materials. 
---
Thank you.
---
I have never reached the Queen stage myself.
---
I had waves of Mirelurks spawn a few times, once I even had a leader manifest and make itself known.
---
That is as far as I've ever gotten with this quest.
---
I can play the game on 2 other accounts, and another console. If it were a ban, they would have my IP listed. But alas... So yeah, I can play the game right now, kiddo.
---
If anything, keep legendaries from dropping. Imagine taking all that time to lose them, ya feel?
---
You should be fine with that then, my 2060 only has 6gb and ultra doesn't fill it all the way up.
---
Lol little late there bud
---
I think it gives them real value. If you want one, you'll have to trade for it. And you'll have to give up something really nice. Instead of just giving up your time.. I think it was a smart move, keeping it so low that getting a rare mask was not guaranteed. 
---
Might as well ban players when they die :))

No NPCs was stated at the *announcement* during E3 
---
What i do for wood ; I travel to Vault 76, then go south. There a real lot of fallen trees and the wood protectron give 10 wood each one time per day or so.
---
It's funny that you say "they ruined the game for you," as if you know exactly how I spent my time in game. You act as if I'm one of the people out there harassing people trying to steal their caps through PvP. I'm actually the opposite, and I did my best to be as helpful as possible. If you're on PC, there's a chance I defended you without you knowing it.
---
Don’t give up. It’s fun after the mid-game grind. If you can make some friends they can really help you through some tough spots.
---
Either a mule character or if you don’t need the actual caps invest them in a 3* weapon/clothes that will sell for the same or higher in the end. 
---
Invest those caps boi
---
After its disastrous launch, Bethesda has done a lot of quality of life changes and improvements to the game. Most notable being increasing the stash from 400 to 600 then to 800.
---
They could get really ugly with it and reset to level 1 and back to 76 you go. True survival, when you die... You die.
---
Wouldn’t simply playing adventure satisfy exactly what it is you’re explaining though? I did read into it but it’s early here so I may not remember, but is there any other bonus besides the xp boost to play pve survival? If not, adventure would be exactly what youre looking for, you would just level ever slightly slower
---
Yeah well the patch notes lied. Yes, it was intended to protect, however, it's bugged and only works like 20% of the time.
---
How do you angle walls?
---
My first reply was a direct link to that image. Then i notice no wood on it.
---
Well if Forced PvP aint for you, go to Adventure Mode. Problem solved.
---
I am absolutely HERE for that knife skin 😍
---
That's a problem in my opinion, in this situation the only player to lose money is player A and the bounty he put on B is pointless.
---
I JUST LOST 2500 CAPS
---
I don't care for materials as much as transferring legendaries, you can always find more junk but 3* spear may be useless to one character but essential to another,and the likely hood of finding the same effect combo is low. 
---
If you can't afford and or don't want to support to longevity of an online game, don't.
---
Personally I would like to continue playing online for some time and obviously that requires monetary upkeep. They could either charge a subscription, charge for every patch/dlc, or charge for items/cosmetics (and so far it's only cosmetics).
---
Personally I think the cosmetics option is the best as if you don't want to pay, you don't have to pay. Personally, $15 is chump change for me and I'm a fulltime PhD/uni student without a part-time job.
---
Yup, players can already loot your meds and sell them for caps, being a raider is viable with that alone with the caps on top it's just stupid money.
---
Yeah I read that later but with how the game runs and the fact your character loads I. Before you get control I think it would be better to just make spawn areas no pvp zones.  That way no relying on a grace period timing out before you even get control of your character. 
---
It would make the most sense. I wonder if there's some sort of MiB contingent also in there?
---
If you're on XBox I can set you up with most of the decoration plans and all the masks!
---
I offer this exact service on PS4.  I Got a character with nothing on it and it's camp is right by the vault so it's easy to get the items over to your new character. I do this for a small fee.   If anyone needs my services let me know 
---
I didn't think about the vault, but it actually a good idea.
---
They could include the bank as being part of a faction, the vault, the enclave or the rich and powerful from white springs and Charles town.
---
There is certainly room for a nice feature here. I guess we will have to wait for another road map from Bethesda to see if they gonna include this. Probably next year :/
---
If you were really waiting for my return you took your sweet time.  I looted all the meat piles in the corner for legendaries before you shot me.  If you needed 60 caps and some stims so bad I would have given it to you by the way.
---
I think the idea of the top three being those with longer lives is to ensure a pvp server is not infested with passive players. If the top three are those with most kills then it could end with those three running like crazy everywhere searching for preys while the rest of the server are avoiding and only minding their business. It’s just what I think. 
---
It’s a nice ez way to meet people to group with
---
You're welcome. 
---
Dense and fireproof are the reasons
---
Better rewards for the more players involved could be a good incentive.   
---
I'm over 800 hours in and only just started playing with a regular group of players I met at Fasnacht, up til then I had avoided most simply because there was no way to tell what their intentions were. During the event I had a lot offer decent trades, local base use and team invites, I now still join them when they are on. Also found players around my age, which helps a lot.
---
I mean you're clearly stupid as fuck if I'm out here with the copy/paste from the email I received. Once again, I don't have to tell myself anything. I just have to wait until I'm reinstated so I can go back to beating the shit out of idiots like you in game.
---
I run a bloodied battle-axe/Sledge build. Deaths have been from full hp, to be clear.
---
I am against damage caps or 'hp gating', they were unpleasant things in Borderlands 2 and only serve as a 'quick and poor' solution to scaling.
---
Actually having a proper load-in invincibility timer. The current one they mention in the patch notes either doesn't work or is heavily bugged. Cue deaths at train stations to the sound of sizzling x many before you can even move.
---
The explosive legendary prefix is broken still. I don't know if it's just the explosive extra damage that somehow bypasses resistances, but something is still wrong with it. I have 45% fireproof...….
---
VATS should not auto-miss targets because they are in mid-air, this a) literally gets melee users killed and b) invalidates the system of VATS. Do they want to add a scaling for VATS damage to penalise 'auto-aim' to 75% damage or something? I can only speculate.
---
Call me biased but if you let a melee user get to your face, you deserve to die, period. How many opportunities were there for turning the target into a swiss cheese? If they snuck up on you....well you are extra dead. Not ''said melee user is at 20% hp because you spammed the left click and half blew yourself up.''
---
Call it Thunderdome and make Rose the commentator!
---
I like that I don't have to agree to PvP. I like that the cap detriment and reward are both high. I like that I drop more stuff when I die, and that I'm not on the map unless I've got a bounty. I even like that people aren't marked hostile unless they have a weapon out. It feels like they're trying to give the gameplay some weight, and make players decide if they're going to just kill everyone they see, or try to risk opening communications and make friends. It's not the same in adventure mode, as someone pointed out earlier in the thread, because you don't have a choice. Everyone is friendly, and you don't ever have to keep your eyes peeled for other players potentially just around the corner. 
---
Ahhh, thank you
---
Use stealth too.
---
Funny, it taught me the opposite, bought it and deeply regret paying full price for this garbage.
---
Which is why you run passive mode, join their group, or ENJOY MURDER!
---
Why do people complain now?! You knew the risk, and you lost, so cry to your mom or therapist but stop annoying reddit!
---
What s AWOL? I'm terrible at algorithms. I mean candygrams.
---
Not snobby, factual. Iv been playing fallout sense 3 came out ( dont play on PC) and many other have as well. Fallout has never been a pvp game, and was never meant to be. It's just not that kind of game. The fallout players that want to actually play fallout wouldent mind so much except that a pot of the players wanting pvp are just dicks. They walk up offer to trade, if you dont they kill you and destroy your camp. If you do trade with them, they kill you and destroy your camp. Or you off doing a quest and come back to a smouldering heap where your camp used to be. If you dont have the supplies on you to rebuild, your just screwed until you gather all that crap up again, basically starting over in the middle of the game. Not exactly but you get my point. This new node they have makes sense, tho I have already seen the groups of like named people attacking other players in the adventure mode servers, trying to build a new character up before they join the pvp. Two of them got a nuke in the face from me last night when they attacked me straight out of the vault and I was scavenging near by. I'm level 81, they were level 1. I just didn't have my power armor on. So you see, already being dicks again when bethesda is even catering to them. 
---
6, 8 hours lol. That's why.
---
You are right. I had like 14k yesterday and joined my first pvp server only to leave with 10k :)) better find me good bargain on one of those one shot kill TSEs that got me down 
---
I played legit and I am not screwed (mostly anyways lol). What would screw me is starting a new character and then within the week getting blasted by level 50 people who can play three times as many hours as I can. I'm not calling you out specifically here but people don't seem to realize that at the sub 50 levels, you have to deal with disparity in both gear *and* levels. With correct planning, which even the next rung up from casual will do, will have a perk loadout that would crush a new survival player by the time they reach level fifty. Remember back in the beta where people didn't have the crazy legendaries yet but melee was just ridiculous? That would still happen with people grabbing lvl 50 all rises ASAP. Perfect gear is the issue with the current set up but I'd rather deal with that than someone with better gear AND 30 more perks. The seasons suggestion getting thrown around would be the same issue unless those seasons ended every week or two. Level-based matchmaking would help at least with people who want to start a new survival only character, but only for so long. Balancing is the key solution to me but I don't know how to do it fairly. Sorry for the long rant, and seriously I'm not calling you out or anything. I'm frustrated too but I think the suggestions getting thrown around aren't hololistic or forward thinking enough. All I can hope for is that the devs are listening and are way smarter at game design than us schlumps.
---
.. initially, the first spawn into my camp and subsequent trek through the forest looking for something to happen was kinda cool. I felt nerves. I felt paranoid, turning at every noise. I finally happened upon a lookout tower and hung out there for about a half hour til someone finally came by and despite having the high ground was totally outclassed by his/her explosive ammo.
---
After that I spawned into a train station and was spawn killed about 5 times in a row..which was my own damn, stubborn fault. The funny thing is that the guy was on the mike actually apologizing for it...but he couldn't stop exploiting an easy kill he said.
---
Finally I spawned back to my camp, to find it totally destroyed except for my stash, my bed, and my chem station. I think whomever, left the chem station as a joke, in case I needed to drown my sorrows with some drugs.. I had a good chuckle with that :)
---
Admittedly, I'm not even close to being built for PvP. I play for the Fallout lore and story and the occasional mutie kill. This Survival mode has potential once the kinks are ironed out, but right now, the cost of losing my hard found caps is too high..
---
Which for roleplaying is a massive immersion breaker and for anybody else is a ballache.
---
A simple Google search will answer you. It's something that is constantly asked by people who never played it yet want to say how trash the game is. 
---
There was an “or” missing. 
---
Sorry I have dyslexica. Hyphening your words doesn’t do anything.  But regardless. Some random Joe is suppose to look up and research the game they bought? Also people Don’t have to, want to, or even care about E3. 
---
There’s quite a bit of non fallout fan players playing that didn’t know about the no npc thing. 
---
You my friend are a 3 star legendary!
---
Milk cure rads, but it's slow.
---
You dont really get that many Atoms or even that fast. And like i said, that was more of an average price, than an actual one.
---
I mean in general you can get about 200 Atoms for 10-20h of play, now with weekly and daily challenges obviously a bit faster, but my whole point was just that 1500 or 500 plus for basically everything is just too much.
---
Nice! Well played.
---
Well bowel-enced - slower thirst and food degradation 
---
Due to this, the account’s access to Fallout 76 has been frozen until such time as all duplicated items can be removed from the account.  Once the fix is live and confirmed, we will reactivate this account and notify you that you are able to access the game again.
---
i can play this copy paste game too, ya know.
---
Is there an expectation that the community will become less toxic? Because in my experience the trolls will last far longer than the people getting trolled until there's not but a literal wasteland left. 
---
Haha oh I was just kidding. Nah I don't have that patience
---
Wait, *what?!*  You mean we're *supposed* to let one get there to summon and kill a queen for actual loot?  What kinda bullcrap is that?
---
This would solve most of the level discrepancy issues in my opinion, it's a must or survival is exclusive to leveled players.  Good luck trying to start a new char as is
---
If you have two other accounts you have ten slots for a pvp character. You just want your duped loot back. 
---
All I see is complaining. The new survival mode is awesome so far!
---
1060 6gb or 1080 8gb?
---
I killed some un-starred legendary wolves ("Leader of the Pack" event in the Forest), and they all counted for me.
---
It’s the equivalent of the DBZ time chamber. Go in, come out and feel like a god that no one asked for. 
---
In my personal opinion, I think that is just a failure in design. 
---
Theoretically, a person at a higher level will be more likely to have found good gear. But that is completely negated by having other characters, and transferring gear to the fresh 50 you made just for PVP instead of using your main.
---
People complain like this is a PVP deathmatch game where it should all be balanced, but it just isn't like that.
---
My main character is like, level 180, and has a PVE focused melee-build. I would absolutely get wrecked by a player with a gun and a couple of pieces of assassin's gear.
---
In my opinion, cap-loss should probably be hard-capped at 50 on adventure and 100 on survival. 
---
Or, literally just die before I hit the leaderboard, and keep playing how it should be, since survival is almost perfect, minus this mechanic. Also problem solved. 
---
Same issue for me and, well, everyone.  
---
How come you played 950 hours and still play in PA being afraid for loosing craftable stuff?
---
What were you doing these 950 hours?
---
That's a good point. But we have to keep in mind that not everyone is PvPing all the time. We can still do quests, events, grind for legendaries, set up a nice CAMP... and being visible for all the predators out there while you do so isn't exactly desirable, haha. But yeah, I understand what you are saying, for sure.
---
I would argue, though, that the way PvP is right now, those players with the most kills are probably the ones that camp the most, sadly.
---
Did Bethesda finally admit that FO76 is still in beta and I missed it? 
---
The challenge in Survival Mode was going to be reconciling how bullet spongey a player is in PvE versus the brutal, almost "realistic" damage values of PvP.
---
Turns out, they didn't even try.
---
To me, they needed to carry some of that sponginess over.  Going after other players is quite fun when instant death isn't a possibility, when you're both dodging, hiding around trees, racing around the environment, etc.  But that's not what happens in practice because of certain overpowered, duped weapons and armor that slaughters anyone who isn't running the same.  It's the same reason why PvP was avoided in Adventure mode.  You come across someone running a wacky build like that, you know they have no interest in a real fight.  They just want to roll around practically invulnerable, sniping newbies.
---
Well, they kind of screwed themselves on that one, because Bethesda gave them their very own mode, and now they try to convince everyone to join it.  Instead, they'll find that they are stuck with other players that share their same mentality.
---
Run outta vats in 2 shots. Gotta love heavy weapons + vats builds
---
no reason to aimbot when you have critical vats headshots. 
---
Hm weird, i guess maybe it's because they're scripted guaranteed legendary rather than random spawns 
---
Some of the duplicates are wasteful, but I find others useful.
---
For example makeshift warrior. I can get by on a rank 1 card equipped, but i have a full ranked version as it comes in handy for crafting. 
---
But it would be nice if we could get rid of useless duplicates. 
---
Then make a character in adventure to level 234 and THEN go to survival... Gid gud scrub.
---
If you CAN play the game why the f@#k are you complaining about this account for? Lol I know why, your hoping to get some other duped items off your account  to your alt accounts
---
Did you want sympathy or to have the community behind you? It's not going to happen, no one likes the dupers or accomplices to said dupers ( which you are) on here... we are actually glad these accounts got banned/suspended or whatever the f#$k your actually calling it.
---
Glad you can play, kudos to you for finding a loophole, still hope all your other accounts get dutifully banned tho.
---
It's people like yourself and your "duper" friends that ruin the game for everyone else
---
Negative, the only item that's duped on my character that I'm aware of is a 3 star AA deathclaw gauntlet that isn't even of use to me anymore since I was given another 3 star AA mole miner gauntlet with 40% attack power on it. I want the toon that I leveled up for PvP to get back out on the wastes and keep my clan safe from griefers, which come for them everyday.
---
Does the perk Last Laugh give you caps/aid if you kill a PvP after death? Might be mandatory in survival mode
---
Maybe poster was ranting about rank 3 autostim and the perk that makes them give more health? 
---
TBH Healing salve is the broken way to go, no animation, weighs less, and fully spammable! 
---
I had no idea this existed! will def try to catch you online. loved the vid  
---
I immediately stopped reading the list and made sure I read the town right. Is there a Beast at Tanagra?
---
I was kind've just saying conditional damage reduction effects and melee in general. Staggering someone with cav stops the sprint, so it's the same effect. Reducing the magnitude of staggers also doesn't stop the stagger. It's always more productive to have dense to negate all explosive damage. Explosive damage is just too common in the game not to take it.
---
Exactly this. Go just north of Gilman Lumber mill which is south of vault 76. On that hillside and near the road, with the woodchucker perk, you can easily get 300+ wood in about a minute or two. It’s everywhere in that area.
---
lol. Its hella OP tbh if you can get past level 20 ish, but still lethal af. 
---
You are clearly too fucking dense to understand simple english.
---
Ive had the same experience. The only 3* im pulling are chest pieces.
---
I’m guessing you don’t have good Legendaries therefore others can’t either? 
---
My camp was set right next to there for the longest time and I never found it. 
---
Lost a good 1.7k caps on that event. 
---
you're a terrible idea.
---
Just luck of the draw I think. I can go weeks without seeing him then I'll see him loads.
---
No worries man 
---
The leaderboards make sense to me. If you are there for most kills that would make the most sense but longest living works for me too as you are getting an extra 20% xp for playing the mode. There should be some tradeoff for that boost. If they made a new mode like you describe that boost should be removed.
---
Don’t take the game to serious man. The game is broken and bad design. I bought a duplicated weapon yesterday. 2shot explosive. I can take it into survival. No problem. Tis game is a big pile of shit man
---
yeah I would love that, but honestly, this says "pricate server" to me. I mean, give us private moddable servers! lol thats what I really want. 
---
sorry, 1060 6gb
---
yes, I asked for sympathy by asking when is the wave coming back. cool logic imo
---
And no, shit isn't duped. I have a full set of cavaliers on the suspended character, meanwhile I have a full set of sentinels on the character i'm leveling now. trust me, getting the gear out off my character is not my intention, I just want to play as him again so I can punch the shit out of people.
---
You can start on a survival server, you just cannot control or dictate how strong your enemies will be. Just like PvE. Survival mode is more challenging because there are dangerous and powerful human players, as there should be months after the games release.
---
Need an extra HUD item -- remaining luck.
---
I have have done Monster Mash a couple times with out any legendaries but I would say 90+ % they have been there.  
---
Yea that does suck. TSE still pack a punch , but If you’re really trying to do damage go with a anti armor explosive (AAE) and grab the tank killer perks. 
---
Building next to it that also will either have crowned scorched or legendary. I always make a run for those 2
---
By working together and killing her? It usually works fine. You see, during real events people can't shoot each other on Survival mode. During loot bonanza "events" like whitesprings... well, it is open season.
---
I guess so
---
Well, in my defense, I didn't say you should actually enter Watoga proper. But that sounds like fun! Nice that you got a legendary handmade!
---
I crawled between landmarks to get there, which was a little nerve racking as if I had to respawn, the closest point I actually discovered on my way was R&amp;G station to the far west. Almost was tripped up by a Gulper in the bog, but I was able to sneak by him. Once I got to the station, I was level 14 and low on caps, but I got that fast travel point and just came back when I was one level higher and richer (the handmade only cost \~750 back then).
---
Dude, I'm lack of materials at the while. So I don't sell but I can craft for you free if you bring ingredients. I will tell you materials when log in. IGN:emreyigit93
---
It's broken.  It's been broken from the beginning.  And it's always there on the map, luring players, because it's rare that anyone can actually complete it.
---
You'd kind of think that if they couldn't find time to fix it, Bethesda would just disable it or something.  But, no.
---
No problem. Please verify how it works for you :)
---
Also, after each new update verify your game's Data folder for new files, Your best bet is sorting the .ba2 archives for the recently modified (addded) ones ;)
---
That would be my luck too. Most of the early posts yesterday were complaints about the upper end, randomized, 75-90% drop rate for aid items out of their inventory.  Such as " I had 120 stimpaks and got killed 1 time and now I only have 15 left, Bethesda needs to fix this shit!"  So either you came across all the lower end randomized percentile drops or the smarter guys who only carried 5 and 3 pieces of fruit. 
---
Sucks I've never saw the legendary ant, and never found legendary deathclaw 
---
The game gives you an aim bot though so how could you tell?
---
No. It's multiplicative.
---
Yeah the whole UX is terrible. Inconsistent, not optimized UI and extremely limited customisation.
---
I think a real, deep, faction or class based system is the endgame for Bethesda here—but after seeing how much of a mess PvP is so far, they couldn’t just go straight there. In fact, I remember them saying something about a faction based PvP system in an early Inside The Vault, but have heard no mention of it since. 
---
By running these two modes they’ll be able to gather data to help balance things. Survival being a beta, gives them a wide berth to make changes and experiment with different things. 
---
I hope they’re learning that there is no one size fits all mechanic that’s going to work.
---
My hope is a system that sets up multiple factions, which also serve as player classes, with different perks, gear and limitations. Each faction is either hostile or friendly with other factions and actual in game events set up PvP encounters, not just a random gankfest. 
---
Aight, I haven’t been on in a while, so I’ll have to check my caps and what the masks are like. I’ll hit you up within the next day or two.
---
&gt; You can always tell when super mutants and scorched are legendary, because they will do everything they can to run away from you.
---
Me: Come back and fight you coward!
---
Legendary Total Bad Ass Supermutant: Run Away!
---
What time zone are you in? I'm in Florida and wondering if you would be online once I get off work so i can look for your shop.
---
That would make sense.
---
I tried making a new character. I got murdered pretty quick. The problem then becomes, I cant get anywhere because you can only respond at a few locations. Which means in survival where people camp v76 and overseers camp, zero progress. 
---
I'm thinking survival is ment for 50+ characters. Not newbies. 
---
I want a pony.
---
aww thank you, Im on PC :)
---
kept spinning around and killing everyone around too fast for anyone, also managed to do this while jumping and non stop spinning etc
---
Callmekevin?
---
yeah really it would be worth more than anything in the game I would think...
---
Ok sounds good! 
---
just because they got it right with me and a few other people doesn't mean everyone who was suspended deserved it. one of my friends got suspended for 600k of halloween candy, and he's still trying to figure that one out.
---
Great advice with an emphasis on adapting to the circumstances rather than worrying about being a victim of them. Like you say, if you're aware that you're in the top 3 then you can expect people to come for you so just be ready. Train stations have been a boon for me as is nukashine!
---
Duped items actually haven't been removed. People who have brought them off other players still have them. They just banned the dupers. And everything is counterable but it doesn't mean it is easy to counter, especially TSE weapons, since the majority of them can 1-shot you. The thing is, it is common to find 2-4 players that have those weapons on a server. 
---
I just made a rule for myself that if I lose more than 1400 caps I'm done with the mode for the day. Made closer to 2000 caps and who knows how much in aid and junk yesterday though!
---
1500 aint much at all. It is exactly on par with For Honor or R6 character costs if you are f2p. If you are active player you can afford every month new PA skin, id say that is very generous deal. Take ESO or WoW, do you get such a deal there? No. 
---
And one shouldn't get power armor skin every second day. With power armor costing 190 atoms, I wouldn't even consider, what I am buying, I would just buy. I would buy even if I didn't like the skin. Right now at least I consider not buying something that I don't like. 
---
No. Crouching does not disable sentinel.
---
Oooh, that whole drug cartel boss vibe...
---
I find he fusion core out back a good indicator for legendaries. If it’s gone then there is a less of a chance. My camp is near by and I would start out with a run through wes tek and at the end I would grab the fusion core if it’s there.  Seems like someone else went through recently and that is why they are not there. I didn’t keep any stats on this but just what I remember.  
---
I pretty much just end up in the mire every time i drink nuka shine. Mostly around harpers ferry region
---
A 3* never meant you'd get a 3* drop, just means there is a chance. You get anywhere from 1-3* loot. 
---
Not really. Adventure doesn’t have the extra dangers of other players that you have to avoid. As some one who likes there to be a threat of danger that makes me want to have to sneak better instead of fight it I might have enjoyed the thrill of having to be careful to avoid players. But for me two things kinda ruin it for me. 1. Having to eventually quit if I get on the leaderboards. 2. Something I think prolly only I want. I like that I have to sneak to keep my dot off the map. Making it so it stays off regardless kinda feels like cheating when the challenge to you is to be as sneaky as possible.  
---
I did a quick run at white springs before work for the same reason. 0 legends
---
This would be the best
---
Let me guess... you didn't survive?
---
High Voltage Hefe: increases energy weapon DMG by 15%, but increases condition cost by by 15% for 5 minutes. 
---
Ballistic Bock: improves ballistic weapon DMG by 15%, but increases condition cost by 15% for 5 minutes. 
---
Vintage Lead Champagne: Increases Fall Speed
---
Hoppy Hunter IPA: Improves scope aiming, decreases VATS accuracy by 10%, +DMG to animals for 3 minutes
---
Red Ant Lager: +50 carry weight 
---
White Russian: Reduces limb damage by 20%  
---
And there are people who will buy there gear off eBay. There are all kinds of ways to work the system. 
---
Are you trying to say that some sort of segregated inventory management might be a good idea in a game where the servers bog down terribly due to in world and inventory items? IDK man, don’t want the game to be too smooth and stable or anything.
---
A full set of cavalier (probs three star) found legitimately of course through grinding and by rng luck? Seriously doubt that btw given your duper contacts... every piece of that was probs duped lol
---
Thanks! I’ve been messing with making a shop for a while now and have the basic gist down, so it should only take a day to relocate and have it all decorated again. If you don’t catch Helvetia Market, definitely check out the next location! 
---
It does. You can test it. That's why they just stand and jump in place like idiots
---
Ah pc the chosen few lol.
---
No problemo, I've got all of that!
---
top 3 bounties maybe with a big circle in the area they are in.
---
Yea whats your psn
---
Sounds like a shitty idea.
---
I picked it up last weekend for dirt cheap and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. I can't say a lot of the criticisms aren't accurate, they are. I'm just enjoying it in spite of its flaws. I'm excited to see where the game goes.
---
Eastern time as well. I should be on after 8pm or so most nights. 
---
Even at its worse this game was never close to being as bad as what the echo chamber made it out to be
---
Kill comfirm
---
No you keep you main. 
---
Lol aimbotting. The game gives you an aimbotting called vats and spawns you in exactly the same place every time. 
---
Stand by spawnpoint, tap q key, click mouse, make caps.
---
Oh I see also tormentors under luck is a good one and bloody mess
---
And then let us put those on our bookcases! Or hooks for keys by the door. 
---
Take a workshop with a junk resource and sit on it for a few hours. It produces many gears among other things 
---
Old Mold is in the Bog out by V-13.
---
Keep going ESE from there and you should find it. 
---
I love seeing CAMPs like this.  Great job man!  I lol'd at that K THX BAI sign.
---
Yeah, accidentally killing myself happened a couple times lol
---
Did you go back to the fire station and use the passwords? Haven't done that part yet, but it would make sense if one had to to have it complete.
---
P.S. It's entirely possible that I have no idea what I'm talking about.
---
What's your psn
---
In the mid 90's I'd have been all about this Survival game mode. Now I don't have the attitude or the patience for it. The descriptions and the video are classic and I'll laugh all day.
---
I can't swim and I know I can't swim so I'll keep my hind end over in Adventure mode where it belongs!!!
---
Yeah, most likely it's bugged. I have never received rewards without letting the mirelurk queen spawn and given how bullet spongy she is and the crappy rewards you get, i just tend to not do the quest.
---
You’re never going to have a good PvP experience as long as they leave stealth boys, aimbots (VATS), and janky ass Legendaries in the game that give outrageous effects. 
---
Remove all 3, and you might have a decent time. 
---
Or even a syringer or drill. Or even nothing of the game feels like you’ve been bad currently. 
---
I play on pc.  I found someone on here over the weekend, but our schedules were too different to work something out 
---
thanks man!! awsome list!!
---
Or we should be able to poop in the toilets and make fertilizers 
---
Negative, with the help of friends. We legit had ppl selling us pieces for 150 caps because they thought it was useless the first month of the game. My set is 2 assassin's (combat and metal lvl 50), 1 unyielding (lvl 40 metal), 1 chamleon (lvl 40 trapper), and 1 vanguard (lvl 50 robot.) Doesn't seemed very duped to me, especially since one of my friends found 3 of those pieces through events with his 50+ charisma build.
---
Glad to have you. A lot of people felt this way unfortunately, It's just nice to have players coming back.
---
You can get to level 50 by playing the game and doing the missions that are given to you. You literally have to do nothing but the missions right out the vault, responders, free states, bos , enclave. by the time you get to enclave you should be about level 50
---
Or just drop landmines. 
---
Yeah, at least they fixed the texture bugs on the default shotty.
---
&gt; It's been nothing but good patches
---
Bwhahahhaaaha!
---
(Love the game myself, played it since beta, never hit a game breaking bug, but come on, get real).
---
Damn you beat me too it!  I came here to say that. 
---
Yes the game still does that and does what the other comments are true. 
---
Camden park vendor
---
Personally I have Tick blood tequila, Tick blood tequila sunrise, White Russian and lead champagne mimosa and I think I saw someone on YouTube with one of the named beers like pickaxe pilsner but apart from those I haven't come across or been rewarded any others and I've only just heard about the one in your title. 
---
I agree. I worked for my gear to get ready for pvp. These noobs didn't. So we should all get punished and our progress reverted. Yeah, also in a leg race we would need to wear weights for these people to think it's fair because of these monster leg muscles.
---
You sure it wasn't all the griefers ruining your experience? Because I'm sure me helping someone trade nuka cola literally didn't effect you at all, you fucking hypochondriac. 
---
Wrong.
---
They nerfed XP gains early on, but by that time I was over level 60.
---
What you are experiencing is the Leveling slog post xp nerf.
---
Nice assumption though, asshat.
---
*harry potter earrape theme*
---
The plans for mixed drinks are a bit more common than other types.
---
Part of me wonders why they felt the need to make the penalty for death worse in the first place.  Yes, people say that the penalty is inconsequential in Adventure Mode, but you also aren't dying left or right.  It's like they thought death would be rarer than it actually is... and why they thought that given the game's track record of unbalanced PvP, I have no idea.  It's almost like they don't have a clue what they're doing. 😋
---
The game was fairly buggy at launch, maybe 10% of the criticism was correct ('cos the lies got repeated and magnified so much).
---
Lived for 2h yesterday, took 16 guys down until my friend accidentally killed me. Good thing that two minutes after my friend accidentally killed me, I have been totally wrecked (0 caps now ^^) by a team of guys that - lets be honest - outsmarted the shit out of us.
---
The truth is that if you are not the most tough guy ever, and you try to survive survival alone, you are without a chance. Get a gang.
---
Looks great! Looks like you kept it one giant piece you can easily move around. Great job!
---
More like Bore: Ragnarok
---
You can pick up unspoiled food and unscrapped junk and sell them for about a cap each.
---
I craft all mine as it’s easier than searching for them 
---
Grafton Vendor Bot next to Grafton Mayor building sells them as well.
---
Camden Park and I think Mack in the fire station does.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted. True words here. I farmed for hundreds of hours preparing for pvp. Guess what? I'm one of the guys getting 50+ killstreaks and surviving 18 hours at a time till I get tired of killing.
---
Yes, cap the caps! Maybe 100 is too low though. Maybe make it a 4x multiplier so caps cap is 200 at level 50+? Still enough to make you reconsider if you keep dying but keeps your solution to make it not outright unfair to high levels.
---
Oh, so you got hit by 1 shot slap damage?  The trade steal "bug"?  Banned for crafting 10 rounds of ammo?  Any other of those mythical "bugs"?
---
I think it should be opt in.
---
Like the hunter/hunted radio station.
---
With bonuses that accumulate the longer you are on it, and the more you have to defend yourself.
---
Although sprinting to a toilet and sitting on it within 15 seconds of ending said sprint results in a bonus.
---
Yeah the weekly legendary reward is really sweet, i saw instigating drill and stalkers syringer on the list. I’m so gonna empty my caps and junks and survive it. 
---
Power Armor does seem useless in PVP, does mean PVP fights will be faster and lighter weight battles. PA is so lumbering.
---
I think with Fasnacht out more a case of accepting the inevitable as opposed to laziness or mooching. I'm probably capable of handling the entire event myself but when fifteen to twenty people show up it's kind of a case of too many cooks in the kitchen. The toads are dead before they make it out of the house, the super mutants are in a ball of flame before they take two steps, the sloth is dead before it hits the ground. It's not like we're gonna fail the event if a couple people aren't giving 110% so there were a few occasions where I just enjoyed the parade.
---
I can pick up as many Propaganda Flyers as I want, you Commie! :-D
---
Orbital strike.....
---
Just saying.... 
---
There's a bunch of trolls out there you know.
---
Is this true?  You cant kill anyone during the queen fight?  If it is I missed that part.  Changes my opinion slightly.  Still whitesprings is like shooting fish in a barrel.  Crazy way to play IMO.  Like hunting buffalo at the feed trough.
---
I am level 150 so the extra experience means absolutely nothing to me. 
---
 I was exploring minding my own business on the survival mode and became 3rd place on the leader board and logged off because I didn't want to be hunted.
---
 Random encounters in the wild would be fine for me. I don't want a target on my back because I've avoided PvP the longest. Very dumb system.
---
Defo a bloodied spiked Teddy Bear Fear 🐻
---
And why is it incorrect? New level players would still complain after two days about being killed in Vault 76, and that's literally what everyone is complaining about, and no fresh save would save you from that after a week.
---
If anything your (wrong) ideas will make things even more difficult for more casual players to get those items as well since trading would be much more limited.
---
that's what we're here for, to tell them how to do it right! or maybe we're just here to complain when it's done wrong..one of those two..lol..
---
u can always drop aid and junk in a “safe” spot, check if the coast is clear, pick it back up and scamper along.
---
Question, how do you offload caps?
---
Apparently even a 1 star or 2 star" can" drop a 3 star from reports though I have only personally picked up a 2 star off a 1 star drop
---
Note these must be star enemies.
---
yo yo yo i dont care about downvotes
---
CLICK IT, you dumbfuck!
---
Survival mode should exist as a different type of server where only dedicated survival mode characters or ported over characters that cannot return to adventure mode can exist... some overpowered legendary effects (i.e. Two Shot, Explosive, etc) are simply removed from this type server or they don't count in PvP... plus the amount of caps per kill just incentivizes high level players to go and spawn kill anyone/everyone
---
But it's nothing "new" exactly.  It's how the wanted system works.  My friends and I would always clear each others bounties in original/adventure mode when we accidentally got them for doing things like picking a lock at a workshop we didn't realize was owned (not extractor locks, just random world spawned toolboxes that happened to be in the workshop area).
---
And as for the Player A losing money... that's the point.  You are playing on a server and game mode with open PVP.  If you want to try to punish those killing you (by giving them a bounty for doing so) then you have to pay for it.  Two times the desired bounty.
---
The only reason I'm not playing is minimap marker locations.
---
There are some who suggested that you should just do away with Legendary effects entirely in Survival.  And in a lot of ways, I can understand that.  Legendaries make PvE fun *because* many are overpowered.  They make you feel like a badass in PvE.  But that logic doesn't necessarily carry into what makes a good PvP experience.
---
1. Stop the fucking high level fear mongering. At any given time a level 200 is no more innately powerful than a fresh level 50.
---
2. No one is forcing a level 10 to join survival mode. It is not designed to be new player friendly. That's the entire fucking reason they've made it so that you can level up in Adventure first and then move into survival for more of a challenge. If they made it a level 50 minimum mode you'd be bitching about elitism. If you they made it new character only then anyone joining late would still end up having to deal with high level players but wouldn't be able to fall back on adventure to level up first. 
---
Nope! Mr. Handy cleaned up the party mess and now you can go back and visit home! It should be a no pvp zone since we are all natives of the vault. I would love to see either player vending machines, or an auction house, as well as a shared vault 76 stash to trade items from character to character on your account.
---
boot knives! 
---
(see what I did there?) ;)
---
Weapon - some are more effective than others, and certain ones work better against certain critters - as you move to different areas and encounter different critters, you'll likely have to change weapons to suit. 
---
 For melee, I used a fire axe, barbed baseball bat, switched to a death tambo when I got that during path of the wind, then a L15 vampire machete.   
---
Ballistic weapon: hunting rifle, hardened sniper rilfe, then a hardened combat rifle.  Shotgun for flying critters.  These are now giving way to an executioners combat rifle.
---
@L48, I still carry the axe and death tambo, but the machete is my default, especially in a nuke zone b/c I cant equip the tambo when I'm in PA.
---
I used a L45 cultist dagger for the first time last night.  It earned my great respect, and may become my new goto.
---
  Along the way, I had fun with the war drum, guitar sword, and bladed rolling pin - high damage but can be too slow once you leave the Forest.
---
Armor was whatever I could pick up, but have been in the same relatively low level mismatched arrmor for the last 15 or so levels - chameleon (for sniping), reduced damage from ghouls, reduced damage from mutants, cloak when hit, and the last piece provides health regen.
---
Theres at least a dozen spawn points in the forest for power armor and cores.  Raider starts at L15 - the highest raider I've seen has been 45.
---
T45 starts @ L25, T51 @ L30, T60 @ L35, and Excavator @ T35,  DIK where X01 sttarts.
---
  You can mix and match level appropriate pieces on a frame, BTW.  Cores are not light unless yoyu have the batteries included perk and you'll burn through them quickly at lower levels w/o other perks.
---
I understand perfectly.... I will play until I'm level 250 and join the challenge mode with level 500 players ( I don't know if the levelling stops so correct me if I'm wrong) and I will get the same reaction.  Stay out of the challenge mode , you're level is to low
---
I'm always going to be outranked.
---
So a level matching system makes sense to me. 
---
Absolutely not. 
---
Sure, and the reason that's *not* ridiculous is that 6 months from now, the same issue will exist. We'll still have people with fresh characters at level 10 playing on servers with people who have level 200 characters. Heck, we'd even have the same issue *2 weeks* from now.
---
This is a problem that requires multiple solutions implemented at the same time to truly solve
---
Everyone misses the point.
---
The game itself does not stand up to the content Fallout 4 had, and maintained to have same issues from older generations without any indication the company was willing to improve.
---
The marketing issue was not directly their fault, however it was handled like a disaster by all parties involved.
---
A handful of people who should have played the game at launch at playing it now going ‘duur i leik fallout’ because yeah, you like fallout and just because you where too dumb to make your own decision now come out and write memoirs of regrets.
---
It does not change the standing issues that the game was designed poorly, and not the product they said they would release.  I can be a lawyer in 10 years, and fo76 can be a great game in 10 years, but that really is not the point.
---
 Watcha mean? A nuke?
---
Do we need to run bloodied/instigating builds to compete?
---
They need to make it so you can drink out of the toilets again. I miss reaching into the bowl for a jet and accidentally drinking 200 year old chunky water. 
---
That's not how bounties work. If I payed 200 caps to put a bounty on you, your bounty is only 100 caps. Hed be losing a lot to do that. 
---
It's kinda like the DZ in The Division - PVEVP. If you have the mask on, you are fair game; who can hang on the longest is the game there beyond candy accumulation. 
---
Beta, but "We didn't listen to anyone who warned us about this possibility, nor were we proactive about solving really obvious issues, like spawn camping."
---
It's just glitchy. I had the opposite happen. I was fighting two other guys back and forth a few times and then non of us could do any damage to eachother after one of the spawn ins. We waited and the invincibility never wore off.
---
You can get plans if you already know the recipe that it tries to teach you for the wuedt
---
Nice then, I'm on main character, waiting for you. :)
---
u/Caatalyst Go back to adventure mode noob
---
Holodeck or D.E.C.K ?
---
Its not legendary... And also the deathclaw sometimes kills the ant
---
That's hilarious!  I love Nukashine.  Spent hours with my teammate exploring.  She'll drink one and I'll go hunt her down to explore where ever she landed.  I'm a total enabler.  Feeding her nuclear waste and addictol just so I can benefit from her habit.
---
Except it’s not a BR, because BR eventually has a winner. There is no winner, no objective in this mode and no reward for being on the leaderboard. If you just want to remain anonymous, just die to a world creature when you show up on the map. 
---
Cave crickets :P
---
There really should be something cool like a high level Deathclaw or something.
---
Duped stimpaks? You seriously think people were spending their time duping stimpaks and THAT is the problem? I have over 1000 stimpaks just from playing the damn game and that's with leaving 90% of what I find on corpses behind, selling then at every vendor and dropping a dozen every time I see a new player. 
---
I get what you are saying. My first play through was like this. I was well over 50 by the time I got the "I am become death" quest. My current character got it at level 30. I am still trying to level up and I started this alt character late Jan. I hit level 49 last night and found the easiest way to level up was to take as many workshops as I could and cycle through the defense quests getting about 500 xp per workshop. 
---
The experience in the game got nerfed pretty early I recall. It def feels like an MMORPG with the amount of exp grinding I've been doing.
---
Balancing PVP vs PVE is a ridiculously complicated task. 
---
With the XP bonus, if I cared enough about PVP, I'd just make a new character specifically for PVP and from time to time transfer all my caps to my main, or a mule or something.
---
I don't envy their job trying to find a balance that both encourages people to actually play it, vs having it still be challenging and worthwhile for those who actually want to play it haha.
---
Check out the Mire and Watoga a lot. Endgame enemies give a decent amount. You can also launch nukes if you're strong enough and go on a whitespring run.  Don't hang around the forest.  You can also do the high level events which pay some, too.
---
I did. It's all whiny bitching about people being stronger than you.
---
Too bad your lying. You can't PvP people below level 5. I tried and i couldn't kill them.
---
Plot twist: this game actually taught you to listen to the masses since you avoided it long enough for some of the worst bugs to get fixed. 
---
That shotgun thing is a bug. In third person the range is insane but in first person it seems correct. I'm all for factions!
---
OMG game changing, thank you thank you thank you!
---
MIRV grenade + close quarters/interiors + sit awareness/running lean
---
Probably last laugh explosives perk only make it better.
---
Suddenly I want to try Survival.  I'll be roleplaying the Creeper :-D
---
Agreed. They’re trying to quarantine. And it’s not working. Should have just made a hard nerf and let that be it. If they can’t deal with their precious god gear being nerfed then done use it. 
---
I wish you were on PC so I could have walked around in your camp. That looks amazing. Truly. You worked with a very limited system to make that shop look stocked. 
---
You know you can spawn at your CAMP right?
---
I have all for 250 each
---
Not to be that guy but perhaps use more realistic tactics. Go with caution if you see somebody. Being constantly alert and looking for potential sources of fire is one of the most important things in a war zone or for that matter a post apocalyptic wasteland. That's what makes encounters intense. Knowing if you make a wrong tactical decision you bite the dirt for it. Ask yourself when entering a new area, "would someone lay an ambush here", "If I was a sniper where would I fire from", "Whats the best tactical position available given my surroundings". It'll totally change how you play 76.   
---
Side Note: its the vats crit sniper builds you gotta watch out for, not us TSE Riflemen  
---
If you're not using an endgame character, find someone who is and get a hit on enemies before they kill it, you'll get XP too.
---
The best is that I try to respawn and each time I lose hundreds of caps before the game even finished loading. I lost thousands of caps just due to being instantly killed while spawning.  
---
Great job /u/BethesdaSoftworks_, really.
---
Confused? Your can't enter the damn mode without a giant warning screen popping up telling you exactly what you're getting yourself into. 
---
Oh well. Risk reward. 
---
That whole thing was just dumb. 200 years in a fridge, seriously? Six months in solitary confinement is enough to drive a person insane. In 200 years that kid would have gnawed his arms up to the elbow and gouged his eyes out. 
---
Hopefully someday. I have 8 Travel Agent cards.
---
That's interesting. Guess I'm gonna bust out my shotgun from now on lol
---
Its just works!
---
I like where you took this. Make all of the factions have a hub that can't be nuked. 
---
Responders: Charlestown or Morgantown
---
Raiders: Top of the World
---
BoS: Fort Defiance
---
Enclave: Whitesprings Bunker
---
Whitesprings: well... Whitesprings (although not a faction, would still be a cool hub spot.)
---
Watoga: Community Center
---
Great idea!
---
I’m sort of the same way with my feeling on certain melee builds. 
---
As a lvl 140 I shouldn’t be able to get swatted 2-3 times by a lvl 55 with a meat hook and get toasted.   A big reason why I anted up to get reactive plates on my PA. 
---
Exactly the same thing here. I assumed there was a small enemy somewhere that I couldn’t see. Basically every time I went there for a week. Then I saw it. 
---
One easy solution: ability to sell unwanted cards for 20 Atoms each.
---
Honestly, I'd delete a bunch for free, just so it's easier to swap Perks [without so much scrolling]. Y'know, or give us loadouts.  ;P
---
Huh, well I will test it, but I swear I take no damage even crouching, I always try to get that sneak attack boost, maybe my opponents have just all had weak ass weapons? I run a Bloodied sniper build, so they definitely would have been able to one shot me. (-20% hp)
---
Actually no, my friend would lag profusely and crash multiple times for no reason, every time I fired my .50 heavy everyone within a mile radius would have 5 FPS, the servers crashed for literally no reason, I would and still get people running in place and lag when there are more than 4 people around, my quests reset if I don’t finish them in one go, and my heavy weapons build wasn’t remotely viable until recently, most of these issues have been fixed, but I have and still play this game, so don’t even start talking about this shit with me. This subreddit is already a bit too much as is.
---
I wish it would be that way. 
---
Again, I personally know a group of german players that farm up to 15 SBQs a day, if you think that people like them don't exist or that they wouldn't get two gears within a week of playing the new mode then you are delusional.
---
Only plausible solution to this problem is implementing level caps, and that's about it really.
---
True facts.
---
i thought it was some sort of bug sound like the cicadas near flatwoods, it was only this last week i figured out it was the letters scroll lol
---
Sorry to rain on the parade. Vault-Tec designed 76 so that way it would seal forever and power down once we left the Vault. This is an attempt to make us resettle the wastes instead of holding up in our nice cushy vaults. 76 couldn't be a player hub for a number of reasons, most notable the door won't open because there's no power and no switch. 
---
This. No legendaries makes the most sense to me. I always wonder why I have to scroll so far to see it.
---
You should have spawned at your camp.
---
I think “read the patch notes” has become the parlance of our times instead of just saying “get fucked dumbass” 
---
Or maybe not

Oh yeah definitely other flaws. The invulnerability on spawn in is non existent. There needs to be a safe zone like in side the whitesprings and the area outside the vault (no camp zone here though). No hurting characters below level 5. Some safety time after events end so they don't become a blood bath. Survival mode focused events that encourage faction based pvp such as securing a resource. And also yes I think you are biased towards melee lol. But yeah idk the bones are there but it needs a lot of work. I think they should focus on the kinds of changes I listed even before balance but maybe that's silly.
---
This is wrong. The shelters protected you from the blast but not from the radiation. 
---
The skeletons are people who died from rad poisoning. This is why you see ghouls inside them a lot of the time because the rads got through.
---
Yeah, I totally want to walk across the entire map again only to be instantly killed by a TSE Shotgun sniper.
---
And Gamma guns
---
Maybe it went something like this:
---
"how do we balance all the armor and shit.... lets just make it so everyone can kill everyone else in 2-3 shots"
---
Never really been griefed, there's a big difference between trading legitamatly ie trading 1-20 items and "trading" 250k items.
---
What you were doing wasn't trading it was helping a duper dupe, but you keep telling yourself that to make yourself feel better lol
---
250k nuka colas, putting the hp gain with each cola aside is still 250k caps gained per drink, now you tell me how that amount of in game money doesn't effect the in game economy and ruin the game?. You may have not used them and only "traded" but you were still part of the problem by helping a duper go about his business.

Really enjoyed your ‘unofficial’ review, thanks for taking tome to write this up.
---
Have a silver 🙂
---
I thought having the option to play on servers that are limited with level caps would possibly negate a lot of this sort of problem. So for example those who wanted to start with a new character in survival mode they just hop onto a server with a level limit of say 1-10 then you go 10-20, 20-30 etc. Along with having higher level servers availble like level 50-100 and 100+. 
---
Of course this would be only an option you could select, you could choose to play as is currently with all levels too.
---
Thoughts?
---
Sweet! I will definitely look for your shop tonight 
---
I can see why you're confused. You see these people don't actually care about the new player experience, they care about their experience. As long as anyone can kill them then it's unfair and needs to change. If they had their way and the mode was fresh characters only then a month from now they'd be high leveled with decked out gear and telling new players to stop whining because they didn't have any trouble leveling up when everyone was starting fresh. 
---
Very good. 
---
Because of two things: 1) acceptance of this game as good means you have incredibly low standards and little to no respect for your own time.  2) I've actually played and pit a fair amount of time into this game and my opinions are formulated on experience and not "bandwagoning". My experience is that this game is trash-tier content by an inexperienced developer using well outdated material.
---
What is that. I cant remember a lot of things, i have amnosia. :(
---
I've been #1 for about an hr now. No one coming after me. Only thing I have on me is 5 radaway. 5 stimpacks. Food and water besides weapons. This is quit boring. Almost like adventure mode but you cant see anyone and you lose more than junk. 
---
There should just be a tally on the map of how many people are in each zone.  Maybe split up the savage divide into north and south so its not such a huge area.
---
Good luck against my loafer pistols. 
---
There is a bug in invulnerability at some train stations.
---
They have a battle hub up at top of the world
---
Your brain is locked behind a case in White springs because you are sheep. Go play adventure mode and bring the party here or run anywhere you can away from the center of the map and go kill and keep moving and "Survive"
---
XB1 tag is Th4tsFakeNews

Whoah whoah whoah, chill out with the cursing buddy
---
I’ve always said the same, the ridiculous legendary effects and perk boosts should ONLY work in PVE. For PVP, especially when they call it ‘survival’, the only things you can rely on is your skills and tactics. A noob’s level 1 hunting rifle should have the same stopping power as a veteran’s level 50 explosive version in PVP. This way everyone is on the same playground. This is how all other popular shooter games were set up and succeeded. And if you talk about ‘survival’, this is how real world scenario works. A 14 year old can take down a 40 year old because the weapons make it a fair game. 
---
You don’t hear people whining about being griefed in Call Of Duty’s Free For All mode because if you’re good with reflex and tactics, you can own senior players. Not in Fo76. You buy a set of duped armor, stand very still, and you can farm new people for caps. If doesn’t get more retarded than this for a shooter game. 
---
You know, no one said I was innocent, not even me. Why does everyone on this fucking site have such a hard time reading?
---
Either way, I've legit haven't had over 5k caps since January. I have no reason for caps when I literally have all of my endgame gear already. The most I even needed caps for was to keep myself from getting hit with the PvP debuff.
---
I don't even pay attention to it. Spawn camping is the only real griefing but that could be solved by varying the spawn points and extending the time it takes to go red. I think the scoreboard should switch to showing the top kills on the map so those that want the attention can get it and the rest can go about playing how they want. I spent my entire night last night as #1 with a huge bounty and it was a blast but that could have been accomplished with just the bounty (which a frenemy put on me).
---
Or they could just stop showing the top 3 players location on the map  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
Lol, 
---
I wonder if you could team up with 1-3 other creepers, server hop at the vault, then kamikaze rush any 100+ snipers waiting to grief level 2s?  
---
That would be amazing...  if you do it, please youtube it.
---
If someone is buying a game without doing any sort of research on it first in 2019 that's only their fault.
---
I wish I could do some caliber of revenge like this.
---
Exactly, no player map positions unless wanted. The current leaderboard system really forces players to hunt eachother but ideally, I'd want just the regular game with maximum slap damage and about 50+ players on the map. (More players means more interaction but yes this is probably too difficult for Bethesda to do at the moment)
---
Agreed, and the concept is good enough that I really hope they don't give up. Fallout 76 is kinda a unique little experiment and survival mode is no different.
---
Agreed, but we all know how those individuals can be.
---
well i've lost 6k caps becuase of campers on every station
---
While the guy wasn’t cheating you could certainly pass along your concerns regarding spawn camping/static spawn points to Bethesda. The game is currently set up this way, which does suck a bit, and the more tickets they get on it the faster they will take it seriously. 
---
Dude was just taking advantage of the system, which isn’t cheating. 
---
Same. This mode isn't for them.
---
Yep, I've been saying it since survival was announced.  Without all the assassin/sentinel/anti-armor/bloodied/explosive bullshit this mode would be fine.  Change the train stations and vault 76 (but leave CAMPs alone) to be safe zones to eliminate spawn camping.  Done.  Game mode fixed.  
---
They would need to prevent joining servers that your friends are on if that is the case. Have a friend join a level 10 server, join him from the friends list on your level 100+. It is an interesting idea though and would be worth trying in some form!
---
I wish someone would come for me. Been 1# for over an hr. Just walking around killing random things. 
---
Nice job! I almost built in there but I opted instead to build on top of the junk pile outside.  Super cool space though
---
Yeah I'd like a cloaked deathclaw would be a perfect beast. 
---
But you can't fear monger over a level 50. You need to bring up a level 200+ loser who obviously uses duped sentinel assassin gear and duped weapons because that's the only way they could kill someone as leet as them. 
---
I have duplicates of the common masks (including soldier) and most of the decorations/recipes.  I'll be on for a bit this evening.

I’m telling you nobody so far 
---
Or play adventure and leave this mode. Thanks. Bye
---
If you're not looking for a fight while using an AoE weapon and you're not in pacifistic mode, you're an asshole.
---
I see your point, but I'm specifically referring to the clock ticking down to find the marchers and people just standing there doing fuck all when there were only like four or five people on site. There were a few times we cut it close because of this (especially as the event went on and interest waned, since fewer and fewer people were showing up). 
---
*Maybe* those people had done it a bunch before and wanted to let other people do it but it got annoying when we were still missing a marcher or two and quickly running out of time.
---
I mean like, he could be on NSFW reddit pages thirsting over people he'll never meet, but I guess he isn't THAT stupid.
---
Why do you think it is going to be anything different? It is going to be nothing but a gank fest....
---
pfft. I have TSE Shotgun Sandals
---
And the best way to do this is to have survival mode be exclusive to characters made for survival mode.
---
Bethesda dont fix immortal exploit/glitch so everything in front of you. Haha
---
Anecdotal evidence isn't an argument.
---
You can fast travel to events as well besides your camp. Stop going to stations lol.
---
If you’re running lone wanderer, dodgy, and serendipity that’s probably enough
---
I'd like if I had a 3star card to be able to equip it, but as either a 2 or 1 star perk so it can fit and still give some benefit.
---
More like open lid, throw away garbage, play a good game.
---
Yes they are you idiot. A level 200 has access to a fuck ton more legendary gear than a level 20 does.
---
&gt; find a way to hide your stash box so no-one will stumble across your camp
---
Don't build a stash box -- the CAMP functions as a stash box.
---
doesnt show the wood tho
---
You're a misstep away from only needing one sandal.
---
If you are are on PS4 hit me up, I have a few decent melee and heavy guns I would sell in my stash (two short/furious etc, no explosive unfortunately). 
---
Then again, those level 10's that thought they could compete with top-geared level 200's maybe should have reconsidered?
---
Don’t let the door hit your butt on the way out. One less snowflake is always a positive gain.
---
I honestly hadn’t even been thinking about it. I joined Survival for the first time last night and was only there for the survival challenge weapon. I had been avoiding people entirely and wasn’t even thinking about friendly fire 
---
Why what happened in 1998???
---
[https://imgur.com/a/BVUow7Q](https://imgur.com/a/BVUow7Q)
---
So your argument to leave behind people that didn't play as much as you is that you would get screwed by people who play more than you do ? 
---
It is such a good idea! I haven’t seen it gain any traction though. Everyone seems specifically worried about levels, when the power is coming from what legendary armor and weapons are equipped. 
---
I’m also sorta concerned about the massive amounts of farming that will be done in adventure mode just to grind for gear to play survival. Server hopping to farm is gonna go rampant. Perhaps it won’t be noticeable.
---
You can mute try it. Sorry this game has other people, they warned you it was online only fallout. Life won't career to you friends but if you read the signs before you enter any doorway; you'll waste less time and have a better experience . Good luck today!
---
Yup, one of the only time's i felt special in game was when someone had to go out of their way to nuke my base. So i just had to return the favor and did the same. Only happened once though, the rest were orbital strikes. They probably didn't like my roof or something. 
---
What gets me is these people actually have nice looking camps themselves. You would assume with such behavior that they would have nothing but half a shack and misaligned benches.
---
I couldn’t have said it better myself. This sums up pretty much every little issue I have with the mode so far. 
---
The only thing I will add is it does seem the the spawn protection works in some places and not others. I saw spawn protection work at vault 76, but not at train station. 
---
ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy congrats! about to hit 50 today myself!!
---
Not really on xbox workshops dont even work 
---
Wadsworth:  Two cannibals are eating a clown, one turns to the other and says "does this taste funny to you?"
---
Lol, he wasnt aimbotting, just using vats cards, cry baby.. and suit yourself if you respawn at the same location over and over. He earned those caps man, cuz you were not smart enaugh 
---
You must love downvoting me. Did I strike a nerve with that one?
---
I cant bring me alt characters in as I have too many caps too lose.
---
Might start a new character just to check it out but by all accounts it doesnt sound very fun
---
Number one on my server yesterday was hiding at tanagra town. Seemed like a very good plan to me.
---
I feel that my guy
---
All good
---
I built my camp on his route, and now I see him almost every day. I think it's just a matter of right-place right-time.
---
One shooting people it’s not fun , you want to be able to engage , flank and more , not spawn killing everyone for no freaking reason 
---
Spawn at your camp, spawn at events, make a travelling camp idk do whatever. Why cry on reddit when you can improvise? Spawn at another station and run over? It's not really that far apart. The only place with little to no spawn points is the Mire
---
Some people treat levelling up like a paid job. If everyone started at level 1, I'd be running around at level 30 after a week and be bumping into level 100+s all over the place.
---
That is correct. 
---
Sorry about that didn't realize it didn't have wood
---
So you should get away with it because they didn't catch you in a more timely manner?
---
Lol for real! Stay out of pvp
---
It’s called SURVIVAL for a reason.....if you can’t adapt move on.....It’s not for you!
---
&gt; Bethesda just forgot to make the game about something, with interesting characters
---
Personally, I think the characters in 76 are much more interesting in Fallout 4.  Granted, the characters are all dead and you have to get their stories via holotape, notes, or terminal entries.  But I feel there is often a depth of emotion and character-building that was lacking in Piper or Nick Valentine. 
---
When you get the BSOD, what was the error message?
---
Yeah, the game always was fun if, like op, you just kinda wander around exploring without a care in the world.  But if you try to put down roots, build camps, collect build equipment, run silos/SBQ etc it really really struggled.  I regret the moment I stopped just wandering around with a fire ax hitting stuff for fun.  I think I'm still about 3 months from reinstalling though, I want an entire patch cycle to come and go without reading about a bunch of new bugs.
---
Good points, but I’m not sure on that testing on personally. As a melee, I can kill Sentinel/Cavalier Assassin just the same as any other gear build. I know they used guns, but the legendary set up really isn’t needed.
---
So i have been liking the new survival. Definitely gives the need to always try and stay aware of your surroundings. Paying attention to footsteps, distant gun shots and not just running back and forth to your next destination. I feel like it gives a more immersive aspect to the game. I started a new character and played for an hour or so and still have not had any pvp experiences. But yes i am doing everything i can to avoid those situations. I have definitely found myself making a "barebones" camp and finding secluded locations that are hidden by rocks, cliff edges and shrubbery. But my opinion may change after I have some actually pvp experience, we will see... Also looking at doing a build with perks mutations that would allow me to need as few aid items as possible (goal is none). I will try to always not keep a big reserve of caps ever. Buy junk and plans as soon as possible to spend my caps since it is inevitable that someone is going to take them from me.
---
You really should be sorted by level in a pvp lobby
---
Doesn't change that it is abusing game mechanics to avoid a consequence of death 
---
I mean like, no one said I'm not guilty. It's literally a suspension wave. Why does everyone here act like it's permanent?
---
Should be 600. Twice your level.
---
242 loses 480 
---
Ouch! Thanks for clarification!
---
sup geezer
---
Thank you for all the well thought out feedback! Survival mode is currently still in Beta and suggestions like this help us into creating this into a fun and enjoyable experience for everyone. I'll pass that along :)
---
Tis resumes he one shot me and i one shot him and we one shot each other for a while until I took his loot and logged off 
---
Or I could be a kindergarten kid who's rubbish at games unless he and his dumbass friends find a way to cheat and then brag about it to the point of being banned? I bet Lance Armstrong is your real hero!
---
Yup exactly as the others said. CAMP. Make a seperate pvp character, transfer gear, and most importantly make a traveling camp you can drop close to anywhere you want. 
---
started this thread with 41 karma, down to 0. less get it popping lmfaooo
---
I had this issue, I uninstalled and reinstalled fallout and it runs perfectly now, no more bsod
---
Wow, it would soon add up if you died a few times in succession 
---
How bad is the cap loss? I’m feeling less excited suddenly because there are so many expensive plans that I want to buy and all the fun of trying not to die in survival mode is going to be a big pass for me if it drains my already too low caps.
---
It's survival mode, if you can't survive then GTFO. Go back to adventureland and be glad there's no one to geek you there.
---
Be a low level and ignore psychopaths
---
1. Didn't say the engine is good
---
2. I'm not defending anything. I'm attacking the argument that the engine is bad BECAUSE OF IT'S AGE
---
What lvl are you and where?
---
I'm not necessarily saying this is what you are doing because I don't know, but stop looking for the perfect weapon. I have several 2* weapons that are still considered end game. You reach a breaking point where mobs become a cakewalk and then from there just buy situational weapons.  I have an AA 1* minigun that dropped for me last night you could have for free if you like. You just need to get across the ezmode barrier.
---
It's Boring anyways. I was able to do laundry and let the dog out while I was at lewisburg station and no one came after me. You think for being #1 for close to an hr at the time someone would be after me.

Interesting, I unlocked suppressor long ago buy just last night unlocked the Powerful Auto receiver after scrapped an auto handmade from a Deathclaw. 
---
I already lost all of my camps because of campers. 6k exactly
---
Actually pneumatic does help prevent staggers (test it for yourself, rather than assume), but a stealthboy'ed sprinter isnt' going to be seen or staggered much, especially because of pneumatic mod.
---
Fireproof does the same job as Dense. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate the heads up on crouch, but it is unrealistic to stagger a sprinter when you don't have a lock on them (especially when they're stealthed). It is much more likely they'll melee before stagger occurs. 
---
Are you on PC?
---
You have to embrace the true meaning of survival: killing yourself every 30-60 minutes.
---
I don’t know because everything I get the bluescreen the screen time of it is like 1sek and it disapears instant and then my pc restart
---
But it must be a new bosd now I think because the old ones I had didn’t made trouble on restarting the pc but now I’m stuck at autorepair before windows is up 
---
Survival is for the fittest. Get fitted and then come back, if you ain't fitted then get out. The option is there lol
---
That’s enough to put me off from trying again! Really needs looking at, nobody can afford to lose that much
---
That is freaking awesome!! 
---
Dropping paper bags full of Nukashine all over the Forest is my new hobby.
---
At least you got something out of it haha
---
Yep. You got me. I was bragging. Totally nailed it. And I totally cheat, because god forbid there were a group of dupers who were literally the best people in PvP for the game, so why would I not want to hang around people who give me an actual challenge? I mean like, after all, I did fight them for 30 minutes before we became cool.
---
Yeah. Pvp is not nice to high lvl characters. Best to pvp at around lvl 50 to 100, especially if it is an alt that you can feed equipment to. That way you have your full build but only loose 100-200 caps per death.
---
If anyone didn't know, the penitentiary yard equipment is loot able now as well, between that and the can chimes (9 cans with 1 lead pp) dotted throughout, it's pretty awesome for lead. 
---
Bad news, bro... if you logged off from being alive the longest... that does \*not\* reset when you log back onto a new server.  So... you're still gonna die.
---
Stop spawning at stations lmao why are people thinking they are safe? 
---
The 1st time I went to Fort Defiance I had a 3\* Ghoul come find me. I was so excited that I added it to my run and now I dont see it ever.
---
As buggy as it is, it just has the right balance for me. 
---
   for starters the theme, i perfer post apocalyptic to wizards/dragons/cowboys/and spacemen. (funny thing, though any of those characters fit here too!)
---
then it has just the right kind of game mechanics for me. building, scavanging/collecting...and shooting!!!  The AI (when working correct) i think is very good. There have been a couple times ive had to stop and rethink my approach because ive already been killed and the enemy will switch up! 
---
 At this point there is more right with the game then wrong, if they keep improving it, ill keep playing. 
---
I got my camp there too, i love that place, we can use the tunnel as e,ergency shelter lol
---
Well, since your entire counter theory is just your opinion, really (There's no evidence that suggests this wouldn't have happened with a fresh start), anedoctal evidence is just as valid as what everyone is saying in this case.
---
We all knew it was going to be like this. This game should never have had PVP to begin with. With PVP you're trying to take elements from a single player game, which was suppose to make a character OP to begin with, now work with PVP. Doesn't work well without making drastic changes to the game.
---
The game concepts were built around a PVE experience. It's just not going to work that well. But, I guess you can say it is dog eat dog game mode.
---
And what about the poor 2 radroaches that live there?
---
I love to check inside everytime i log (got the camp in the junk pile node) to hail them with my shotgun lol
---
True, it’s be nice if I could have a mule account I could transfer stuff and caps to in-game. I only have 1 character like most people, hopefully in time, these things could be addressed
---
The good news is,  it's getting better for 76.  In a way,  -the preserveance and continuous baking have helped 76, because it's still alive. 
---
76 also being a test bed for future Bethesda games help too. 
---
Because people still have a chance to try it again.   And discover the anger is overblown. 
---
Haha no.
---
My comment below addresses this.
---
They nerfed xp gains early on, but prior to that you could gain a level every 10 minutes just fighting large groups of enemies, which were SUPER common around whitesprings, again, before things were nerfed.
---
And as far as my "attitude", it comes from nothing but negative experiences with this game.
---
- Crashing every 5-10 minutes like clockwork? Check.
---
- broken questlines? Check.
---
- framerate issues on a near constant basis? Check.
---
- Disappearing inventory including a full set of X-01? Double check.
---
- absolutely ZERO customer support? FUCKING CHECK.
---
This game is fucking trash and anyone whi thinks it is "good" either has no self respect for your own time, or just has incredibly low standards.
---
Can’t install/uninstall now because I just don’t get to my homescreen because windows dosnt go to that point on a restart ... I’m stuck in autorepair everytime i restart it try’s to repair and then it says that it couldn’t repair and asks me to restart again or use some troubleshoot options that didn’t work
---
No not at all. Locking a character in survival screws you. Allowing to switch between the two means you can play at whatever pace is right for you in adventure before trying survival.
---
I’m thinking my preference is going to be not carrying any aid. 
---
Never lasted over 1.5 hrs yet again I never tried to fight back I was treating it like a true survival , seems like the ability to show on the map leaderboards doesn’t help underpowered players 
---
Yeah
---
Marine Tactical Helmet- plastic, glass, rubber (everywhere), weighs 0.1, maxed out trading perk nets u 27c each with a Charisma of 4.
---
Useable toilet and THEN you drink them ! .... Eeergh 
---
&gt;pvp mode
---
What? I thought it was called survival mode? Why does the game need to help you find other players? Can't do it yourself?
---
I recently bought a TS one, and a Furious one to see how they perform, so my setup is 2 lmgs and a .50 it's pretty great. 
---
Super Mutants as they almost always carry caps. After you hit the 1400 sell limit, find the green oafs and watch them roll in.
---
My 2 cents that i submited in another post:
---
The state of survival right now is still kind of casual, with "TOP players" and somewhat icons above your head when you aproach someone (that is dumb).
---
Maybe what i'll say is not everyone cup of tea, but the Survival Hardcore aspect i imagine in Fallout, is the one where you need to be in the tip of your toes everytime, like in DayZ or anyother survival game. If you die you lose everything you're carying, your armor, your weapons. YOU DIE! Of course you would keep your level and perk cards but death would mean you lost your stuff like in any other survival game, maybe this would make high level players be on alert.
---
That would make people way more careful, if it was any kind of hardcore. Death would mean death. Respawn without any item only your level.
---
I'm sorry if it is not what most people want. But imagine a world where death means death, and you actually need to protect your base or you'll lose it all (that part about base raiding i'm not so sure yet if would work great in this game)
---
And another problem is that this game is far from a fair hardcore pvp mode, i don't even know if it's feasible since there is so many RPG elements that would drift away from the pure survival aspect. Anyway i'm still glad we received some kind of pvp content, but it still is in its infancy.
---
They should have exclusive survival characters only but not for the reason you're saying.
---
Exclusive characters changes it from Deathmatch mode to an actual Survival mode. Eventually those players who actively hunt down other players will have to farm junk for themselves to support the habit (repair/ammo).
---
Right now they can easily switch back to Adventure mode to "reload" for Survival which takes away nearly all of the drawbacks of spawn camping and constant pvp. 
---
Allowing crossover between the two modes is by far one of the worst design decisions I've seen go live in this game.
---
As a low level I've unfortunately gotten used to checking the map before going anywhere in the Eastern sector. Whitesprings has somebody double my level? Guess I'll look else where.
---
It seems like a lackluster system at best, but at least the map is large enough that every location can't be driven high all the time. 
---
Thanks for all the responses. From what I have heard 75% of your aid, picked randomly gets dropped. I'd anyone has any different experience please let me know just trying to get as much info as possible
---
nope I don't think so Pipe Rifles are only benefiting from  **RIFLEMAN** and not  **GUNSLINGER** (even if they are automatic). But I haven't tested it with  **GUERRILLA** . So I can't be 100% sure
---
F
---
The reverse is also true. You can make 1000s of caps in an hour.
---
I tried to find a recent thread, but I couldn’t find one for March? maybe link me some of those posts so I don’t have to waste time?
---
Just listen to him talk because he has a lot to say. He says some stuff about why he trades.
---
Karma i concur , same build , different player , boring stuff 
---
Maybe don’t carry so much shit with you? 
---
Agreed fully, what they gave us is not survival mode. It is a really bad deathmatch game that is unplayable in any normal sense. Totally the opposite of what I was looking forward to when they announced this.
---
All those bugs and all the other bugs are still around. Just not as prolific
---
agreed 1000%
---
FO76 suffers from zero character progression, only better gear really does anything. This game any really all games of this sort need levels to mean something beyond better equipment else they might as well remove the levels. Increase hp by either some set amount or by a percentage for each level and include Stat allocation into those calculations to make a tank build viable. 
---
Only the prime receiver. Learned that the hard way. I mad 1 lvl 50 one, and 10 lower level ones to scrap for mods. :'(
---
I've completed this plenty of times by simply ignoring the directions, start it up then hang out on the shore line by the cabins and kill anything that moves, I mean you can get into the water with a mirelurk queen if you want to.  It's a low reward event because it spawns a boss archetype creature.
---
So, if I kill (for example} a level 20 I receive around the same caps as I would if I had died?
---
I think it would be a great idea, but to sweeten the pot, make base siege a quest. Higher risk, higher reward.
---
Lvl up another character to 50 with a pvp build, then get a friend to help you feed it pvp items, then go kill lvl 300s for caps, and then use your friend to transfer those caps back to you main.
---
I made a new character and moved over at level 2... I survived fine until I did any one of these:
---
* became the person who'd been alive the longest on the server
---
* picked the lock on a requisition and got a 20 cap bounty / wanted on me
---
* left a landmine for the guy who hunted me down for being the longest alive... and it popped after I'd respawned, so I got another wanted...
---
* fast traveled to an event in progress, or back to where I'd just died.
---
Outside of that... I did my thing, I was a lot more careful, and it wasn't really a big deal.  Definitely a different experience.  But certainly not impossible.  Most of the people seem to be clustered in one area (you can see the loot bags as they drop) and killing each other.
---
Basically, if you're not wanted or longest alive, you're not showing up on the map.  So nobody sees you.  It worked well so far, anyway.
---
Yes , would put everybody on the same spectrum and rely on terrain knowledge and more 
---
Same here but you will never have that in that mode with the way the leaderboard puts you on the map eventually.
---
I did not know that I haven't logged back into survival yet, kind of a dumb mode.
---
I'm just wandering around the ash heap. Big target on my head. Person before me was lv 19 and lasted 4hrs as #1. No one killed him he just quit the server. 
---
Yeah but the furious handmade is a level 35. I also got attacked by a mirelurk queen, and high level protectrons that ate all my rounds. I'm essentially trapped unless I get out without dying, and now that I don't have a level 94 PA buddy to clear out the high level assaultrons and super mutants and protectrons for me my chances are low. 
---
Oh,  certainly,  certainly! 
---
Problem with tech is that you can't control what everyone does with it. 
---
See the social media penchant of trying to make everything "advertiser friendly. "  The act itself encourages trolls to troll harder, individualists to crusade, and simply make things more toxic.
---
I don't know a solution, especially because I think anger is so useful when turned against a valid target.  The only solution is to learn to ignore trolls, but you can't even teach that to the billion plus people on the internet.
---
And the option to list most recent first.
---
So much this. The leaderboard kills the potential of the mode.
---
I really want a shared bank as well but for now since I own two PS4 because my children and I like to play games together I can always log in my daughter or sons mule and make safe trades. 
---
I think you would receive 40 caps for your 1 bullet. Killing lowbies is the best way to sell ammo.
---
so annoying... playing a sniper build, sniping my enemies, getting discovered, try to switch to my unsilenced lever action, switch to bare hands, get mauled INSTANTLY. feels bad man.
---
I'm not so sure about a mule pvp character? Already reading about people losing thousands in caps &amp; hundreds of aid. Probably best keeping those roles separate.
---
Yea instead of a weird death sound they should tie things to your pip boy ui more. All that screen clutter. I do not think anyone wants a Battle Royale. 
---
The fact they have a player based map kill zones from nukes they could’ve made player based nuke zones spread like other Battle Royale forcing players into smaller safer zones to escape nuke zones. Have that in place while people try to do quests and I can see that be a thing. Pressure from pvp as well as the environment which could be prevented by stopping a nuke launch. That would be more fallout than what we have now with leaderboards. 
---
We just wanted the actual tension of organic encounters while playing the game normally like someone else said... too many subsystems they wanna govern how we play but again the method is not fun and it’s super not chill. 
---
Whoever is deciding how much someone can tolerate a play session isn’t actually sitting down and playing the game for the length of time they expect us to. 
---
Right, you get one guaranteed legendary Gutsy at AWOL, I've rarely, almost never, seen multiple. Are you saying you regularly see multiple legendary Gutsies at AWOL?
---
Just dont build a camp. Just place everyting on the fly when you need it. Don't let your stash box out, or your stuff you carry is gone if someone shows up and kills u
---
But it seems one of the main points of survival is to essentially FORCE PVP. Otherwise it’s relatively easy to just avoid it altogether even in survival
---
You are spending your time trying to annoy people on the subreddit of a game you consider worthless, you really don’t have anything better to do? At all? No friends or family to talk to or something? This is your only source of entertainment? 
---
That's best if you're not specced for stealthboys. I'm too used to enemies with duped items (or can get stealthboys easily, or can make stealthboys last several minutes).
---
I saw so many people hit the top three and kill themselves to avoid it last night. Totally broken system
---
Once upon a time I had a home on the junk pile, too! Till I came home to find 3 scorch beasts screaming at my home. While scorched were beating done the walls. I tried to save her. But all I had was a no star shot gun, plain ole 10 mm and a bat. So I hide in the area where your home is picking off the scorched one by one. I went though a lot of stimpacks and radaway that day. Used the tunnel to make my way to Watoga. Then later found another junk pile to rebuild my home on. 
---
I've been reading and recording all the feedback here on Survival mode and changes players want to see, thanks for taking time to write this out. 
---
Put on woodchucker and loot the wood piles at Sylvan and Sons logging camp.
---
Oh yeah! I love how creative the community is (and I definitely was asking from a place of "it's cool that multiple people can be enthused about the same thing" rather than "bridge wall mine doughnut steel"
---
That isn't mine and I haven't seen it! I hope I do. I love seeing other builds around the Mire.
---
So I tried it .. The first 3 mins was Really fun as I plotted where I should go - buy then it dawned on me .. this really is as OP put it .. "Death Match" .. All I wanted to know was where the other players were. I did not care about the events, the work shops or anything else because why in the world would I go questing knowing I could be killed any minute. So I head to White springs station via fast travel .. 
---
Wouldn't  you know..as I am not fully loaded but able to run , I start running and then I hear it .. slight grunt sounds as if I am being hit by something .. sure enough I am dead by the time the screen fully renders all the graphic and now I can see the murderers.  There were already a 2 people team terrorizing anyone that got close. One shotting anyone and everything. 
---
So I place a 200 cap bounty which quickly vanishes ? Are they able to kill each other and collect the bounties still cause that thing went too fast .. and they were the only two around. Anyways I decided I would try to get some revenge it took me 10 mins to get myself around them and up on top of a building with sneak at max and chameleon .. I felt confident I could snipe them from a high enough position and then move on.  
---
So, There I am Waiting , and waiting and waiting .. and then it happens they finally circled back for another scorch run in the parking lot, I left the scorched alone on purpose so I could hear the perpetrators attacking them. So I take aim .. pop , hit one .. Pop hit him again .. and then I notice .. His health never even Flinched. I did not even scratch this guy.  So I take aim on his Buddy .. pop, pop, pop .. they can't even see me or find me and I am unloading on them both but NOT DOING ANY DMG AT ALL .. literally not one ounce of dmg is showing up. 
---
Now as I type this, which was going to be a RANT of how unbalanced this appears to be. I find myself asking myself ... "Hey Self is it possible that you had Passive mode on in adventure mode and it stayed on when you moved over to Survival mode? ... And that is why you were not doing any dmg?" Now Normally I would instantly say yeah that must have been it , but in adventure mode you would be notified in the top left when ever you are hitting someone , it reminds you that you are in passive mode. 
---
So, Now I have to wait 10 hrs before I can get home and check and see if that is it .. Unless someone can confirm to me it does carry over and you have to turn it off. Either way .... I wasted 30 mins of My Life trying to kill 2 guys I could not kill .. BUT it was the journey that was fun. The execution not so much.  I really hope it is because Passive mode was still triggered on .. IF not .. its gonna be a tough sell for me to stay in survival other wise. 
---
Hmm interesting I’m going to have to keep my eyes open for them then! 
---
Haha we've definitely shared this with the Dev's before but I will bring it back up.
---
You really can’t when everyone has Chameleon or stealth boy double taps. The other people are trying to get that 20% more experience.
---
Nick Valentine lacked depth of emotion? Bullshit...
---
The cap loss is double normal and you will be hunted to death
---
Definitely not the [first time this happened](https://i.imgur.com/fdU7VdK.gifv)
---
Just out of curiosity, do silos spawn legendaries?
---
I am specced for it, it’s just entirely too costly to run a melee build in PvP servers unless you’re fighting trash players. 
---
Making a new player can take anywhere from 11 to 19+ years depending on maturity and protectiveness and requires two people or a lot of Science! It may also impact the amount of time you can play. 
---
You won’t lose your main from that or making a new character, though, and it’s far less expensive. 
---
No one is saying you can’t use your gear in adventure mode, I am just saying I have seen the majority of comments complaining about survival, not Thats it’s super awesome fun. Honestly it’s whatever, I won’t be participating until they fix it, and it’s not a matter of “getting good scrub” there is no skill to this pvp... none and if you trick yourself into thinking there is, you are just trying to boost up your sad little ego, it is completely gear based, the gear is completely broken. If it takes griefing to make you enjoy a game so be it, but make no mistake, it’s griefing and nothing else.
---
I meant use as mule in PvE, and stash chems in survival.  I dont have space to stash anything to play survival on my main.
---
im going to open the ticket to waste their time like they've wasted mine
---
It seemed that they removed a bunch of the duped stuff. You're also literally the only person to actually answer the question properly, even if it wasn't a yes or no. Thanks for that lol
---
He indeed did the Fallout 76 intro,
---
Ran into a top player that built a base over a cliff and just sat there.  Explosive minigun, lots of stealth boys, rocket turrets, etc.  The rewards are way too low to try and deal with that.
---
Oh I agree it is costly. Hence my remark on people that had duped stealthboys. Cost wasn't an issue for them. 
---
Yeah think that’s the only way I can do it
---
This. It would also explain why I can’t give stuff away anymore. Literally nobody accepts gifts and starter bags anymore lol.
---
That is a huge annoyance, I've had that often. I'm thinking of a redesign placing a shell around it as a bunker... But feel free to come over and kill scorch beasts from the roof any time! 
---
***i could not hurt him because of pacifist on***
---
It isn't that bad, but annoying. My current [estimates are](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=717308889)
---
* 2\* enemies drop 2\* loot about 55% of the time.
---
* 3\* enemies drop 2\* loot about 40% of the time.
---
* 3\* enemies drop 3\* loot about 33% of the time.
---
I think I'd be okay with this since it requires caps to do. 
---
I’ve seen low-levels for a few weeks but there’s no way to tell if they’re alts, mules or genuine new players. Of those low-level players I know firsthand, it’s a mix of the three. 
---
Either I did not know this or I do not remember it. :)
---
Wow! So the incentive is ALL on the low level players?
---
Turn pacifist off so you can damage other players.  Workshops enable other players to attack you.  Places you in PVP mode.
---
If you are going to attempt to kill other players, make sure you set your game to allow you to deal damage to other players.
---
Or escape route!
---
Yup! Don't listen to the others, you're right!
---
Thank you very much for your acknowledgement. It's nice to know we're being heard. I had another post about this subject [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b6127f/survival_top_3_shouldnt_be_based_on_time_survived/), in which I made a suggestion for an alternative leader board metric, if you have time.
---
I think people are learning really quickly not to rely on aid. You’re just giving up a gameplay advantage upon death. It’s not gonna work out for them long term
---
do you have a link? I'd like to see the video.
---
Since the exp nerf, leveling has been a chore. Easiest but riskiest way I have found for a quick level or two per hour is take workshops. Last night I took (excuse me I don't know the names exactly) the dirt track, the junkyard, the happy holes workshop, the power plant in the toxic valley, and grafton steel. I did it while having cranberry cobbler in my belly (+5% exp) and being well rested (+5% exp) and just make crows nests at all these workshops for killing at a distance. the exp from clearing enemies, the takeover, and the defense mobs with the quest to defend, I went from level 45 to level 49 in about 2 hours. you risk being flagged for pvp though doing that, so be sure to store your junk often.
---
If anyone else has ideas I would love to hear them.
---
I set up a temp camp by \[redacted\] so that I can farm and switch servers to take advantage of the 20% XP bonus and the weekly legendary achievement.
---
Love it!
---
You could always spawn somewhere else or sever hop? Or did we forget about that? 
---
LMAO I'M DYING SO GOOD
---
You literally ate the MF
---
I have a question... is avoiding confrontation NOT a valid strategy for a mode called "survival"?  Because it should be, and right now it's not.  What is the point of a stealthy build if success is punished?
---
Perhaps I need to progress just a little in the story and try again. I need a bunch of achievements that weren't granted from beta. So I thought now would be a perfect time to get those. 76 was a warzone for the server I jumped into. 
---
Ah, that's a fair point then. I didn't experience any events with that low of a turnout.
---
Oh... that \*is\* pretty terrible... of course, you can always off yourself and clear it, too.
---
We are hoping they will turn off camp damage in a future patch. They seem to be listening. I think it was not done yet because CAMP and workshop builds are likely the same thing, and making one invincible would make the other too.
---
&gt; They scrap to black titanium, which is a clue that they go to the excavator. 
---
While they always show 2x Black Titanium as their components, I have noticed that scrapping Mods doesn't always yield the listed components.  Sometimes they yield nothing, sometimes they yield other items all together.
---
I think it's a mod scrapping bug.  Or visual mistake about what they actually contain.  I have been trying to document all the excess mods I pick up, and what they scrap to vs what they show as components.  Rarely do they hold true to their listed components.
---
I can't play for a few days, do you have an image of the bundle?
---
If you mean the Whitespring, you've committed a cardinal sin and should be ashamed. 
---
Well alright then that’s a lot simpler than I expected 
---
Thanks Mothman knew you’d help (: hahaha
---
I started pvp,thought I'd give it a try, and had fun for a while.  When another player put a bounty on me, he found me at my camp.  We traded kills back and forth as he destroyed my camp.  I didnt do to bad given my gear and perk loadout arn't planned for pvp.  It wasn't till his team mate showed and started destroying me with a explosive handmade rifle that i got a little frustrated.  I'll go back to adventure mode for now and regroup.
---
What I learned:
---
1. Grind for for more pvp focused gear and perks.
---
2. Build a more defensive camp.
---
3. Build my camp further away from Whitesprings.
---
Things I'd like to see with survival:
---
1.  Pvp disabled inside Whitesprings main house and maybe a small radius around train station.  I shouldn't have to play defense while trying to trade or use work benches.
---
2.  Buff to camp turrets in survival.  The turrets were about as useful as my jukebox and they were rocket turrets.
---
3.  It would be cool if any bots around Whitesprings, Watoga and trainstation would become hostile if you had your weapon drawn.  I mean they were designed to stop civil unrest.
---
I also learned, that fast traveling with chameleon on, you still spawn in cloaked.
---
Alright I'll be online soon today. 350 caps for it?
---
oh drats!,  i've been discovered!
---
Yeah, someone who has been here since beta and waiting for Bethesda to stop screwing up is a snowflake.
---
It's in the back, up the hill a little bit in the NW area.
---
Yeah it is that lame.
---
yikes...
---
Sounds about right. Although "get fucked dumbass" is so pretty relevant. 
---
Yeah sure ! 
---
Well, I agree with the basic idea... but... at some point, there's gonna be new characters and old characters anyways. There will always be new additions to the world.
---
Yes please. Survival mode currently doesn't make any sense. We are supposed to be rebuilding america and the game is forcing people to attack other people lol. Encouraging it when it should just be normal mode but survival mechanics.
---
Is it wrong that I went into Survival Mode purposefully in order to clear out my Stash? 
---
Best Diet Ever
---
SURVIVAL is the point of playing. The satisfaction of survival is the reward itself. Leaderboards or not, you should not be able to see anyone on the map outside of bounties. 
---
I was hoping survival mode would just be adventure mode but with no one on the map and PVP restrictions removed and THAT.IS.IT
---
Anyone else hate the whole leaderboard thing? :\
---
Could you mark it on a map?
---
I think it up the wooded hill behind the airport, just beyond the back fence, but I can’t tell you more specifically where.
---
GOD .. take my upvote .. LOL. I can play it all out in my head right now .. 
---
I just ran into wandering responder vendor bot Chad! And he had all of the excavator mods.
---
Random server disconnects though. Safer to just have a mule or buy a second account and transfer that wa y.
---
They've already got the model for it... in ESO. It works great in there. 
---
I moved on to other cemeteries.  The one at the Airport had issues as well. I had to move to the center of it before it would get recognized.
---
Isn't this the way Bethesda puts out updates?
---
There is definitely an incentive to kill low lvl players that offer a minimum risk per cap. However, you would have to kill a lot of low lvl players to get the same number of caps as killing off your lvl 300 character. The best target in pvp right now are high lvl characters (lots of caps) in PA (a sign that they don't have a clue about what is good / bad for pvp).
---
The vault has it but some or all train stations don't have spawn protection for some reason 
---
I agree .. in pvp .. Vats is just Silly. Here let the game automatically aim for you and you just have to pull the trigger. Ugh .. 
---
New characters only would only be a temporary solution. People will always be on top and those below will be at a disadvantage. I travel for work and only get to play in bursts every few weeks so I probably would not even notice much of a difference if they forced new characters when I finally get to play in three weeks when people have been playing 24/7 to get on top are there. Actually it would be worse for me because I’d be forced to start a new character at level 1 and since I’ve been playing since release and am only level 47 that means I’d never have a chance in survival. They don’t need to balance the game for me, but they should balance it for fun and being camped by a group as a single player and losing everything I worked for sounds nothing like fun to me. Hopefully they come up with some good middle ground.
---
im trying to hit that quest as low as possible, for grins, on my 2nd toon, so far i have managed to join BoS at level 20, fort defiance sucked but i managed to join up 
---
You can buy the plans from either Grafton or Camden Park. There's a responders vendor in the middle of Grafton near the high school who will sell you the plans. As for standalone mods, it's the same but they're badly labeled. Instead of defining by the type of power armor they're for they'll just say 'Hydraulic Bracers' or 'Rusty Knuckles' with the only tell being that they break down into Black Titanium.
---
I just love this sub.
---
It's awful. I forgot the struggle when making my new guy, and the kicker is, my first was melee so ammo wasn't a problem, but when everything is taking 2-4 clips to kill, you will have an ammo problem fast. My advice would be to server hop when you get to quest areas that are spawning too high level guys for you. It's not a perfect solution, but got me out of fighting level 62 ghouls when going to whitesprings.
---
This mode is just like communism. It sounds cool but its not cool when done.
---
This mode should've been called "get killed by a fucker with TSE handmade or a C.A.M.P. armed more than a fucking nuclear silo"
---
thanks for this. I have some MIRVS in my inventory, might finally  use them :)  What about Nuka grenades?? Have you tried those at all?
---
I smirked .. You get an Upvote 
---
This looks great!!! Great job!
---
Made a new character last night. Strolled down the hill to the overseers camp, got killed my a lvl 89 with a super sledge. Ok.
---
Respawned, walked down the hill again. Set up a camp outside flatwoods, and went on with the responder quests.
---
Got attacked in the church, killed both of my attackers. Went across the road to do the registration, got shot in the back while on the terminal. Logged out, and seriously considering not playing survival again.
---
Just a note, those are Plans.
---
Mods are still randomized.  You can find them at many vendors.  Harper's Ferry for sure (It's where I have picked up my Excavator Calibrated Shock mods post-vendor patch).
---
Just a note, Camp Venture has multiple potential Power Armor mod spawn locations.  Including the Desk by the Weapons Bench in the Level 3 locked cage area.  The three stacked boxes by the Power Armor stations and power armor spawn, and the shelf inside the Storage Key locked room by the Tech Data turn in location.  I always check all three when I turn in Tech Data.  I have found Excavator Calibrated Shocks there on more than one occasion.
---
Actually I'm  a player from asia and I know how those "normal players"will react to this [question.No](https://question.No) matter in my own country's BBS or in Reddit,they just act as the [same.My](https://same.My) situation is just like urs and I hope bethesda is really working to solve it instead of pretending to do so
---
What kills me out of this entire thing is you have the nerve to try to insult my intelligence, meanwhile if you actually read properly you can just see that I'm asking if anyone has an idea of when the wave will come back. Not to make it a priority. It's not to complain. It's not to claim innocence. I literally just want to know if anyone has an idea, because even that will be more than what I'm aware of at the moment. But you stay classy and offensive for no reason, all that edge must make it hard to wear clothes, considering you're always beating your dick on this fucking site lmfao
---
I can’t wait for prestige respec, I fucked my cards up because I didn’t look into the cards and just went. Had like 10 different builds and now I’m melee. PvP is not for me right now.
---
Man your triggering me with this. Everyone who criticised the game and got fed up with it being absolutely fucking broken had very good reasons to be verh pissed with this games devs. 
---
I loved the game at first, it wore me down though. I can't attest to the state of the game now, i hope it's much better. But you have no idea what the game was like buddy. Maybe you'll find out in good time, i doubt they fixed *everything*. Afterall 90% of stiff was buggy as hell. 
---
F.E.C.K!
---
Really well cluttered up!
---
Same with all real events. As long as you are both in the event you can't attack until it is over, it is like being in a group together.
---
I'm sorry, but I don't think it has to do much with leveling. Pretty sure it has to do with the fact you're always gonna get one-shot by legendary weapons, no matter what your level is, whether you're 1, or 50 and up. I don't...thiiiink these weapons and gear were really well calculated to handle PvP. Just a thought. Might've been better to just remove them entirely from Survival and just make the weekly legendary item rewards a mail system to send to a character in Adventure mode you wanna give it to. 
---
I mean I made a "raider" at one point and at level 4 made it to sam's bunker, got the key to the enclave bunker and unlocked the bunker right away to be able to craft stimpacks. I appreciate that you can do whatever you want however you want.
---
I'm on the fence about legendaries, but the spawn locations are clearly broken. I figured that out yesterday real quick when I died three times at the Whitesprings station and lost all my aid items + about 500 caps. Fortunately, I realized my error and changed my tactics - so I actually had a lot of fun with Survival. But, fixing the spawn system would make the game mode much less exploitable / more fun. 
---
I doubt they've forgotten it, it just might need to be increased (or set to start at some point farther into the loading, if that's even possible).  If it's a set timer from when you first connect to the server, and the load times are long for whatever reason, it may just run out before you fully load in.
---
The update notes state that the invulnerability is removed 'if the player fires a weapon'.  So they thought through the process, and assumed that the invulnerability would last longer than it takes to load in.  Obviously that's not happening, so it's a matter of adjusting the timing (length) of the invulnerability to overcome the loading times.
---
Well, I was looking forward to trying survival mode... I'm sad to see it was never implemented and they decided to go with a deathmatch instead. 
---
Thats why I havent played in Months
---
For first time players yes, for people with hours into the game you are right.
---
I am level 64 and since it was my first and only character I don’t have any of these amazing weapons or guns. I get absolutely creamed by anyone that knows how to pvp with their explosive one hit black powder weapon.
---
That is strange, and not the same result I am getting. Very weird. 
---
What system are you on? Pc? Xbox? PS4?
---
You don’t lose money when you are killed because of a bounty.
---
extremely overpriced. and when building is what you enjoy most and then you have to buy pieces (each freaking color of each different piece full price) it's pretty gross.
---
the atom gain is very slow and the price is very high. I don't mind paying for some atoms once in awhile but for building alone it's cheaper to just ...play another game even with a sub fee.
---
(I don't WANT to play another game, I want to play this one, all fixed and bug free and buy atom stuff without feeling ripped off. and not have items I bought change after buying. and not have flash sale limited time items I may not have atoms for at that very moment because I just saved and bought something else and didn't know this was coming up)
---
Uuughhh... I do _kinda_ want to see what it's like. But that particular situation doesn't sound much fun :)
---
I personally would like a radio or tv station that announces active events, or has a countdown to when a event will be active. obviously not so cut and dry, make it fit in somehow.
---
Yup, simple and great.
---
Yeah, you learn to tune it out, until you hit a quiet moment where you are not concentrating on it. It sucks the worst at bedtime.
---
I accepted.
---
Crybaby? Explain to me how I’m a crybaby. I enjoy the game and it’s far from dead. Even if you’d love that it was dead it isn’t, just let us enjoy our game and stop being an ass.
---
Weird. Months ago, me and my buddy tried server hopping about 6 times just to see if we could get a still living Evan to spawn. He'd be dead every time, but in a slightly different spot in the room. Almost as if he spawned alive, in a different spot in his walking path, and died there. 
---
I have duplicates of each common, how much were you wanting to pay? 
---
I’d guess you accidentally damaged him with a vehicle explosion or something? 
---
Yeah that makes sense, also chuckled as the killing I received was from a guy in power armour.... HOW BAD DOES THAT MAKE ME?! lmao! :+)
---
The reason new characters would be preferable isnt because of level, its because of outrageously overpowered gear. I wouldn't mind leaving behind my OP stuff on my adventure character if it meant everyone else did too. Its really improbable that all the players I've run into with assassin/sentinel/cavalier armor and explosive weapons got them legitimately, and it seems EVERYONE has them. And it was written in the patch notes that the likelihood of one shot kills was reduced but thats completely false. Im still one shotting with melee and people still one shot me with explosives, even with really good armor. As it stands now you either wear assassin/sentinel or you are basically naked. The leaderboards painting a big target on your back just makes things worse but thats a separate issue. 
---
Try to win a round of PvP as a melee only non stealth boy against a stealth boy sniper even if you see him.
---
He most likely already sees you before you even get your eyes on him and he is already 8 steps ahead thinking of every possible route you can take to get to him and how he would handle while you are still assessing the situation.
---
That would be great 
---
You mean like OP, "I played 6 hours 10/10"
---
I've always wondered if there wasn't some form of organized conspiracy to run down FO76 in the media upon release. Was it perfect? Hardly. But it wasn't the worst game I've ever played, and CERTAINLY not as glitch-ridden as some Youtubers made it out to be... 
---
I suppose "bad news" (or a "bad game review") sells (gets more clicks)?
---
That sounds like the setup for some grenade porn. 
---
FINISH HIM!
---
While I agree, that's not how a tape deck works.
---
Wait are we suggesting renames for Survival mode now? I vote to call it The Most Dangerous Game.
---
There are still invincible people though, so why has it changed for me and not others?
---
Right, well while yall we're on here complaining, my friends and I were playing survival for 5 hours.  You only catch me wasting time with y'all when I'm at work and shit is going slow.  Apparently my build functions very well in this game mode which is nice and I love that I don't one shot people with my bloodied fist.  (Though it only seems to take two shots at most).  Had a lot of fun, and I also took some new characters along with me to Wes Tek and with the 20% exp buff and 15% from tram they were leveling up fast as fuck which was also nice.  Even ran into a few guys who didn't attack despite being level 80+ and completely capable.  I also like that my assassins sentinel set didn't make me invulnerable but definitely helped me close the distance.  I had to Sprint from cover to cover to get to this this shotgun user on a roof and punch him(took two hits and a lot of jumping around cuz I couldn't vats due to having no AP from sprinting and jumping, had like 5 health left cuz he got a shot off on me lol) and then another guy I'm assuming is a vats build sniped me off the roof.  But my level 12 friend managed to finish him off too.  It's really fun for all levels IF you enjoy this type of game.  Downvote all you want.  Because this Reddit is known to not reflect the players.  We are playing. You are holding hands.  I made enemy-friends with two power armor users and we banterd back and fourth putting bounties on each other for an hour lol.  We were legit laughing.  Y'all just don't get it. Lol
---
That looks sweet, I'll give you 2k for that!
---
I feel ya. I expected that to happen, even with having to break my post down in sections. God forbid if the first sentence was just to tell ppl why I got suspended lol
---
Yeah considering in all the material for the survival beta it says you are able to quest *just* like in adventure.
---
B.S. in adventure I don't have a target pasted to my back every time I'm alive for an hour or more.
---
Craft ammo at tinkers workbench and gunpowder at Chemistry workbench 
---
Ok so, you call the game dead without giving an explanation, you insult people who enjoy it, then you call me a crybaby for no reason and then refuse to hold an argument backing you up. I’m having a hard time taking you seriously mate
---
Sounds like a lot of fun to be honest.
---
Added you
---
If you see something that seems to obviously be an exploit/cheat, report that person to Bethesda with as many details as you can provide.  If someone managed to come up with a way to kill everyone on a map at once, the logs should show that pretty clearly.  But the more info you give, the more likely Bethesda is to believe your report and know that they need to look into it ASAP.
---
I kept getting 1 shotted by one if that's what your wanting to hear
---
You were vulnerable to his team well before you could get into grenade range. Maybe with a missile launcher, or the like, but I don't carry anything like that.
---
Simple, immunity until level 5. No damage taken or done to players.. After level 5 you lose immunity and it’s full survival. 
---
2.5k
---
&gt; Do shotguns have as much range as sniper rifles?
---
During the waiting time I turn to BFV and just find it much more fun than Fallout76   LOL
---
That is your problem. Look the reviews the game is pile of shit with shitty pvp, no interesting npc:s, shitty holotapes, no endgame. Tell me what this game does good  please tell me.
---
Doesn't dying without enough caps to pay the bounty cause you to receive a 4 hour PVP penalty?  That only counts down as long as you are playing?
---
I mean, personally I think the penalty is a little light (-50% damage to players).  And the bounty should probably remain until you have enough caps to pay it all off.  Have an 800 cap bounty but only 100 caps on you?  You get the same penalty, and your bounty is only reduced to 700 instead of zero.
---
You're right and the downvotes are in justified.
---
**TWO MEN ENTER ONE MAN LEAVES!! TWO MENT ENTER ONE MAN LEAVES!!**
---
**WHO RUNS BARTERTOWN? MASTERBLASTER RUNS BARTERTOWN**
---
Top 3, I believe. 
---
Mr. Stark I don't feel so good...
---
Propaganda flyers and blank holotapes are great for putting down paper bags to be used communally ... to make sure the bag doesn't fall through the map (which it can do on PC)
---
If you plan on running mutations, I would swap one of your luck skills with class freak. I have almost an identical build, I used Grim reapers sprint for a little while but found it wasn't great in the long run. Other than that it looks very viable imo
---
That DMC5 go hard, too. Like, there's plenty of games to run with, but Fallout 76 was literally the game I came to hang out and pvp in. Now I guess I just gotta body people in other genres until I get my alt up to level lol
---
Any recommendations on the best place to find those starred legendary enemies?
---
EXACTLY!!! Damn Bots keep littering and we're saving you from the EVILS OF COMMUNISM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I got to about level 70ish, it was hard going for me to get the platinum. This was a comment i posted at the time i stopped playing, explaining why i couldn't stand the game at all and had to put it down. It was just after they nerfed a bunch of good perks for no reason a couple of months ago.
---
It is a good game underneath it all, but i don't have much free time and i don't want to waste it working around and putting up with glitches and bugs. There are great and well polished games out there. I could write a neverending list of bugs i experienced, some ignorable and others that made the game temporarily unplayable.
---
My main quest disappeared for 2 days once.
---
I completed events and got zero reward, sometimes it wouldn't even register as completing at all.
---
I got kicked out of a server nearly ever session, sometimes multiple times a session.
---
I have had items disappear, duplicate on their own and spawn 'phantom' items that never go away.
---
The lag, everytime i logged in i had to be careful not to do anything to make it freeze.
---
Multiple sessions of not being able to invite friends, see them online or simply accepting the invite.
---
I've had invincible enemies, scorchbeasts under the floor spamming me with their attack, enemies that couldn't be targeted, legendaries that have no loot.
---
I've been permenantly invisible, naked, stretched to a power armor frame shape and friends in my team i could neither see or interact with aside from seeing their names floating around on the screen.
---
I've had quest markers lead nowhere, out the map, somewhere impossible to get to and then sometimes when i looked exactly where to go online because the marker is bugged the quest was uninteractable.
---
I've suffered throught weight glitches, accuracy glitches and zero weapon damage glitches.
---
Some perks didn't work properly, some not at all. Some still don't..
---
My friend has a glitch where the 'get to level 50' achievement trophy just never triggered. We were going for the platinum together but that's ruined too.
---
I honestly could have kept going with bugs in that comment, it was literally everytime i played i wojld encounter them. I personally habe never encountered a AAA game as broken as this one was and could possibly still be. 
---
I think an excellent addition/modification would be to allow sneaking to take you off the map while you're wanted/marked, but that as soon as you stood up, the ping would reappear, and then stay to show your last known location. Maybe even an audio cue or message stating that you'd been "spotted" again to other players.
---
I'm not online often so maybe it's that but i have yet to see SB attacking.
---
Yesterday some Supermutants Overlords knocked on my door but i got 8 missile turrets guarding my little village so that helped me a lot lol, those and my favourite shotgun that's obvious.
---
IKR? I was all into trying survival then saw how much aid you lose. I have to use up a ton of aid and get rid of as many caps as possible before I venture back into deathmatch
---
Hey just do what I did, 
---
Clip your a rash box and C.a.m.p. piece into a large tree in the woods.
---
It is completely unnoticeable. 
---
Play it yourself? Idk man, I enjoy it. I don't give a shit if you do or do not, but you don't have to come to the reddit of the game just to be a cunt
---
permadeath
---
Your lack of faith is disturbing.
---
I was glad I ignored the anti-hype.. I got the game when it came out and have never regretted it.. Only regret is how many other games have been sitting to the side while I play 76 LOL
---
Does graham carry anything special to sell? Only saw him once early days then never since so didn't really know what was what
---
The bed is inside u can’t see it 
---
Oof we have to compete now. I'll give you 3k now
---
Intelligence? That's a stretch. What kills me is arseholes who have to resort to personal attacks just because everyone disagrees with them. In answer to your question, you will never get your cheating account back. Simple enough for you? And if I'm offensive, then you must be a total cunt.
---
I would be happy to. Although I suspect this impacts everyone who bought the camo bundle yesterday.  I bet someone simply forgot to add it to the bundle as a whole.  
---
Locking to server with only 24 slots and horid server performance is not going to be fun at all. 
---
I'd be happy if the trade screen was stable and not constantly kicking me out when doing large trades on the PC.    
---
Hope we both have good luck about our fallout76 accounts.I'm a bit missing my 2 shot and explosive Gaussian rifle LOL
---
\+1 
---
I've always found inventory management of the keys and holos to be a major pain in the arse. Ability to sort would be nice, too; say, by date, so I can find the most recent holo I've picked up. 
---
Battle Royale has become a word for PVP that people don't want happening. If it's not to their standard, it's automatically "Battle Royale"
---
Our faith has been betrayed multiple times with this game. I think skepticism is warranted at this point. 
---
I bought atoms yesterday. Got the new ultracite paint , camouflage paint pack, and knife skin. Now my quest to get ultracite calibrated shocks intensifies. 
---
lol....not bad....just unprepared for the shit storm that is survival. Live and learn.
---
I filed a ticket (190327-002467) thanks for you’re reply 
---
hey im down to buy that off you hmu : shtarshiner
---
I had to restart my computer to get it to work
---
That's being dishonest. This is called "survival" but the whole sale argument is that all incentive to PVP have been boosted.
---
not sure how well this helps but ive noticed that just because something is 2-3x ur lvl doesn't mean its impossible to kill when using power armor for protection, ive just been using either my T45 or Excavation Power Armor as protection and can still kill most things without too much issue, though I still die from time to time
---
ive been using a melee mostly to save on ammo for when I got like 5+ mobs to deal with then the guns comes out
---
im currently lvl 38 but was lvl 28 when I came back and was killing Ghouls, Scorched and Super Mutants without much trouble with power armor and a melee/range weapon highest lvl that I can craft at the time
---
It most certainly is a shit storm!
---
Aand there it is :D i have played the game beta and the release i have  over 100 level character. There is no real content in the game as you you said yourself you dont even know whats good in that game and that tells alot. And ofcourse i have to come to the reddit of the game and annoy people like you cause its fun. Also the game has terrible graphics shitty rendering and copy paste assets, also all the bugs from fallout 4 are there. Bethesda scammed you and everyone :)
---
You are testing it. Lmao. 
---
Nice camp! What table is that at 3:09 with the bar stools?
---
A lot of the dupers had more than one copy/account of Fallout 76.
---
Dupers with 2 accounts not only have God tier weapons and armor.......they also likely have 2nd accounts to log in with and bring themselves aid.
---
Dupers should have been enemies of Bethesda but instead Bethesda created a new game mode for them to dominate the honest casual players.
---
I wish Bethesda were in the casino business with their total lack of ability to stop the most simplest forms of cheating. I would be at their casino every day.
---
Make sure you grab the code off the guy at the entrance before you go inside, didn't notice him until I came back outside.
---
all fair points, agreed!
---
last time I checked I got maybe 60 atoms a day roughly (not more than 100) if I did every daily challenge. that is no where near fast atom gain at all, not even comparable to other games. 
---
and even though wow is overpriced at least you don't feel *as* ripped off. because you can collect stuff IN game and mog it anytime you want. of you maximize your sub fee by farming the cosmetics in game you want you can do that.
---
ESO really has it done better than FO76 ...probably should be putting some time there. 
---
I went back to Conan exiles though after their latest updates. the building is better (than any game I've played) and I can drop $10 on one dlc of texture packs ... I get every single asset: wall, window, door, door frame, foundation/ floor, ceiling, gate, awning, multiple roof tiles (I lost count on the variety ), WEDGE triangle shaped foundations, matching triangle roof tiles, ramp pieces,fence pieces.... the dlc also comes with 3 entire armor sets (light,medium,heavy) as well as every single weapon type in game. and then all the crafted decorative items like lamps, furniture, rugs, etc.
---
but not just cosmetics here : craftable end game epic quality you can make. and wait, you can also craft armor for tameable pets (that work and literally guard your camp and don't disappear) in a few of them. I'm not even talking about build budget here either. or light restrictions. or placing junk.
---
I'm comparing a game you buy (just like fallout76) plus the buying cosmetics to enhance visual game play. all of that for $10 (and im sure I'm leaving stuff out I overlooked)  $10.  there doesn't have to be in game currency to earn to buy that either. it's a flat fair fee to add to your game and I don't feel ripped off at all.
---
Same here, and no discount 
---
Campfire is the survival. Dont ever go there while having aid items you dont want to loose. I looted like 400 stimpacks total yesterday and then lost it all in one encounter where our enemies outsmarted us totally (not like in one death, more like in all my attempts to get back at these awesome guys who rekt us so much). The highest number of stimpacks I seen in a single loot bag was 70 so these amounts are pretty big.
---
So even sprinting i seem to be dying in one or 2 shots from any weapon. Seems off to me.
---
I had to read this two times. Herpes Ferry Bridge Camp ...
---
I find it kinda weird that there aren’t any solid benefits to surviving in survival. I would have thought that making it to the top of the longest life leaderboards would give some sort of additional XP buff beyond the 20%, or some special perk effect to make it feel a little more balanced/rewarding. Something to motivate players who have long lives to be risky with those lives?
---
Maybe I’m missing something though? Idk
---
I’m close to the downed airplane if you ever need to borrow some sugar. 
---
That'd be cool if this was an anime battle royale game ;P
---
And they replied almost instantly , known issue and they are aware and looking for a fix .
---
Fast and informative support 
---
I think i know what you mean, i scrapped a whole bunch of combat armour torsos and finally unlocked polymer, saw it come up on the top left side of the screen then when i went to mod my combat armour torso the polymer option wasnt there, frustrating to say the least.
---
Read again. 
---
I said it would have happened with a fresh start, so that's not my thesis. My point was that with a fresh start, it would have been (surprise surprise) a FRESH START. 
---
But I won't argue longer, you are all convinced it's perfect to have level 295 spawn killing players with duped material on day one of a game mode, that's all fine by me; I'll keep in Adventure mode :)
---
I must have killed 16?20? legendaries by now but only gotten credit for 8....
---
So by your standards, you're the asshole who has to resort to personal attacks because you couldn't comprehend the point of the post. Ya nah meen?
---
whats your build/weapons?
---
Since they announced the survival beta everyone complaining one way or the other mostly seem to forget that last word,  *beta*.
---
 If we don't give feedback on the problems how can they fix them?
---
Maybe just that one legendary weapon that’s it and purge the assholes from regular adventure mode 
---
Also if someone else builds too close to it. I am constantly fighting at least one person for the spot outside of Morgantown, on the intersection on I-64. I almost always have to hop a server or two to be able to place my CAMP there.
---
Or at least put players of similar level on servers together.  I don't understand how this isn't an obvious solution... new players or new characters who start in survival mode stand no chance so why is it even an option
---
Bidding closes in like 15 minutes because I gotta get off.
---
Bidding closes in like 15 minutes cause I gotta go.
---
&gt; I don't mind PVP, but I kinda want to do it on a fair ground. Which Fallout 76 is currently unable to bring to the table.
---
Could you elaborate on this? Survival Mode doesn't seem to be your thing, but the changes to the old mode (now "Adventure Mode") will likely make it a more reasonable experience in regards to player interactions. 
---
At least a death each hour once you go on to leaderboards
---
For me, it took weathering the Anthem release period to realize what a game devoid of content truly is. 76 is jam-packed full of things to do, the game just doesn’t give you many clues as to what to do after you’ve beaten everything. As bad as stability was at launch, it runs much more reliably now and aside from the goofy “Bethesda moment” glitches that we’ve come to love from other fallouts/elder scrolls games, there’s not really anything “game breaking” happening anymore, other than mostly isolated incidents. I hope history is kind to 76, but it’s also nice to be part of a club that has first-hand knowledge of the game and doesn’t just regurgitate the YouTube rhetoric with no actual knowledge of the game.
---
They knew this would be an issue, that's why there's (supposed to be) brief invisibility. The problem is that it's either not working or it doesn't last long enough. Easily fixable, at least it should be. Meanwhile, maybe be more tactical with how you respawn in. If you keep respawning to a place you know people are, that kind of on you.
---
Dupers spawn camping with no loot in their God tier duped armor with their God tier duped weapons periodically logging in with their 2nd account to bring themselves supplies.
---
Good job Bethesda!!!!!
---
likewise, my good sir. i missing running through a group of people and slaughtering all of them.
---
Good thing I don't care about downvotes ; )  Hell I experience the bugs and glitches EVERY day I play. I know they are there. Still there I should say.
---
But in 2-3 weeks when all the new characters have OP gear again then we are back to the same problem today.  Starting fresh is a temporary solution.
---
is really that hard to make zones in the game where you can't attack?
---
are you online now? We could trade rn or add me for later if you want my id: GrayKillsFox 
---
The leader boards are fine. Let people track their stats if they want to. What is less fine is the longest life leader board marking you on the map  because you did a quest instead of camping a train station. Maybe just mark players who are wanted.
---
There should definitely be incentives to kill, but not at the expense of all the other aspects of the game. 
---
There's not always a bounty. And bounties aren't even paid out through the person dying in Survival Mode. It's paid by the person posted 
---
You're spot on. I forgot about ESO. I played it a little bit after they normalized the damage and it was great to be able to go to other zones and not worry about getting absolutely ROFL stomped by every mob. I wasn't thrilled with the way they handled mineral level up there but that's such a minor thing and likely not relevant to FO76. I really wouldn't mind if all of FO76 was done that way (probably in the minority there), maybe with the exception of the really hard to kill enemies. 
---
Read the patch notes.
---
The robots will constantly spawn until you clear the area, however, so there’s some pressure to move. The PA system will announce that it is fabricating additional security before they spawn. 
---
Stealth sniper, Bolstering Armor with Bloodied weapons. Also have an Exterminators explosive hunting rifle for other bloodied builds lol. But mostly use my Lever action, the base damage when health is at 15% is 700+ and I can up that with perks. Critical is a must for me to, vats headshots for those hard bastards in Sentinel is a god send. Have all the perks that boost rifle and exp damage, people say its poo but I have over 70 kills now and I'm rolling in caps lol. Stealth wins survival hands down, regardless of level. I'm only 111, a guy I play with now and again is 47 and he's just as good, not as good as me haha. 
---
OMG that's crazy. Also I am so glad I asked because as is so often the case with this game, what is logical is not necessarily what they chose to implement! 
---
Well, I've been playing since the beta and I certainly dont recall getting a level every 10 minutes, but then again, I was playing the game not farming XP to power level... because I enjoy the GAME. 
---
To the same point, I, and most others, have not had the problems you did... so perhaps the problems were at least in part on your end? That's not to say there were no bugs, just none that were game breaking for me or even very annoying. I expect that in any modern software, because coding is not easy and millions of lines of coding exponentially increases the chances of having glitches enter the base.having to support legacy systems also causes a ton of headaches as much as people who have bleeding edge equipment that may not yet have stable drivers. So again, maybe, just maybe, the issues were on your end or either your ISP perhaps?
---
Personally, given the time and target constraints, Beth Austin did do a fine job and quickly addressed issues after roll out.
---
You are a very judgemental person...except for the one thing you actually have the ability to change, namely yourself.  Perhaps you should go back and read some of your posts? You might just figure out why you get the negative reaction you do. 
---
Cheers!
---
I'm not going to say you're wrong because I want there and who knows.  However I did play for a solid 5 hours straight and I'm wearing 4 parts cavalier and 3 parts assassins. And two unyeielding (one of my parts is the ultra rare unyeielding cavalier).  I was using a bloodied fist and I noticed early on that even if I was super low health it was taking two hits to kill people (I think this is intended).  So I started rolling same build bit 50% health and was still taking people out in two hits generally.  I ran into some low levels who stabbed me and it was doing near nothing even without damage reduction (just assassins, wasn't sprinting).  Gave them some stimpacks and went along.  A lot of the guys I came across were explosive rented builds (not sure if bloodied or two shot or whatever) and while sprinting I'd get staggered but I could usually still close the distance.  It would usually be close because while punching they would hit me too (cavalier stops during punching as you know I'm sure) and reguadless of player level (40+ at least though for perks) most fights felt close or fair (for a fallout game anyway).  I will say vats screwed me a few times because it won't work at all with even the tiniest obstruction when youre melee so I just stared at people, locked on in vats, not able to attack because a destroyed wall was on the floor lol
---
Well if we are gonna put emphasis on .. You Died .. And in Death you should lose it all .. Then maybe we should Also Say you DIED .. so go back to start and recreate another Toon. Kinda like Hard Core mode on Diablo .. You Get One Chance and One chance only. 
---
I actually Love this Idea .. But it only works If you don't allow the transfer of toons from one mode to the other .. Survival,  as many have said should have been a start over - None of this Dip my toe in the water , I don't like it I am going back to Adventure mode. HELL NO, it should have been a complete do over and SURVIVAL of the FITTEST.. You die .. You drop everything on your person and anything in your stash goes bye, bye with your character.   So Again  if you wanna put emphasis on .. You Died .. And in Death you should lose it all .. I think you should lose the toon too...
---
I don't mean lock it to a specific server, I meant lock it to the survival mode.  So you can't run away to adventure mode when you're in trouble or what not.
---
My main problem with legendaries in Fallout is that they put zero thought into actual game balance like most other studios do with PVP titles.  You want to give you players options, but not make it so there are obvious winners and losers in regards to gear.  There will always be a meta, but it shouldn't be 100% dominant.  Games like COD, Battlefront, WoW, Overwatch etc. are always tweaking stats and abilities to offer parity between playstiles.  Fallouts legendary system does none of that.  If you have Assassin/Sentinel &amp; and AAE Shotgun  or Unyielding/Sentinel &amp; AA Unarmed its game over.  I don't think bethasda put thought into how those legendary mod combos and perks would essentially break the game in PVP.  Some of them are just too strong.  Can you beat them occasionally?  Sure, but 7/10 those builds are gonna wipe the floor with people who aren't evenly geared/specced.  Disabling legendary abilities for survival turns it into what it should be, an evenly matched hardcore survival PVP experience.  It's not about who spent more time farming legendary ghouls are whitespring or dupping god tier items, but about who has the best perk combination (which everyone has access to with no RNG involved) and skill/strategy.  Legendary items cut the competitiveness of Survival mode off at it's knees and makes it way to skewed towards one meta.
---
Pretty sure they are adding a legendary vendor in the next month or two: 
---
My only real threat is the Queen, apart from that anything and everyone is fair game. I've have spent over 150 hours of the 300+ doing Pvp with a bloodied build, it's done me good from the off. 
---
It's called survival, not deathmatch. Survival implies knowing when to pick your fights. Melee builds aren't as viable in PVP for the same reason they're not in real life. Formation Melee tactics fell out of fashion as firearms became more accurate and reached out to longer range. The same is true in 76 but it's caused by the elimination of the slap damage modification. Melee builds won't be able to pick constant fights anymore, if a sniper has your position figured out and you're not able to approach him perhaps it's best not to approach him.   
---
I'm completely on board with you on assassin sentinel though, nothing frustrates me more than the hopping murder bunnies. 
---
Yes i understand this..so if u are in pacifist mode you better not take any workshops???if a player takes your workshop and attacks you (no problem) it shouhld automaticly turn of pacifist for/to that player...
---
Not listening to the "gamer" community is exactly why I love this game. It came out during my deployment, and I was sad that I was going to miss the release, since the Fallout universe (which I include Wasteland in) is my absolute favorite. I didn't read any reviews, watch any trailers, or listen to what anyone had to say about it, other than the general bitching which was nearly inescapable anywhere on the internet.

Honestly, stuff like this is why I cringe at the word "gamer" anymore. I love video games, and I think they are one of the most impressive art forms ever created, but I wouldn't personally call myself a gamer anymore. I don't want to identify with a community that seems to be lead by unbridled emotion about uninformed topics, hivemind mentality, needless insertions of politics, and searing hatred from ignorant fanbases that has nearly destroyed entire companies.
---
Sounds awesome actually 
---
What about the new level 1 out of the vault?  Should they just spawn at their camp?  Or at one of the exactly zero other options they have to spawn?  I guess a level 1 who doesn't have a full set of level 1 sentinels assassin's gear is just fucked right?  And before you say "don't bring a level 1 to survival mode" why is it even an option then?  If high levels are required shouldn't they be... you know... required?
---
it has to be better than survival now, i couldnt even make it out of vault 76 yesterday without being 1 shotted
---
Tell us what exactly is wrong then.
---
Stealth sniping and I'm getting blood results mass caps and aid items
---
They shouldn't be starting a new character in survival mode in the first place...
---
This is what i have been saying as well, remove legendaries otherwise they will never have balanced gameplay. And melee needs to be nerfed. Even though finding legendaries is a bing part of the game at the moment, some legendary effects are so powerful they break the game, especially pvp.
---
What's with this TSE obsession recently? Explosive, yes, but I very much doubt its tse's that are killing you, they are definitely NOT in fashion at the moment. 
---
The fucking point
---
You
---
Thanks for the insight, jerkoff.  If the notes explained the changes that would make sense.  But they're intentionally vague and incomplete.  Player testing has already shown massive changes were made to the way PVP damage is calculated.  What we need is clarity.
---
My CAMP is next to Fort Defiance and been there like 200+ times already and yet never saw a super mutant O\_O
---
The present system would make survival mode so lopsided hi lvl players would dominate it. Causing lower lvls to not play it. This would effectively kill survival mode. So weapon balancing has been added. Exactly what that is I do not know. Maybe it will be shown in the pip boy stats. I only know what was in the patch notes.
---
It would be a temporary solution with the current state of the game, but ideally we would see some lengendary balancing, like making assassin and sentinel first star effects so you cant have them on the same armor. My point in my last comment was that everybody and their mother is running around with full sets of incredibly rare weapons and gear that wont just reappear in a couple weeks. 
---
@L48, I spend a lot of time in the west side of the map.
---
The only high respawn I have seen in the forest and toxic valley has been at Camden park - first many times through, it was L6 or lower scorched - last time I went through (as about a L36) the spawns were L32 scorched.
---
Savage divide and eastward, as well as the ash heap, appear to be variable.
---
Thanks, I submitted a ticket, but I wasn't sure if there was a way in game.
---
Oh and I have a chameleon leg, just the one. 
---
That's why free for all is stupid. There has to be factions.
---
Unfortunately it was the same with the FO76 beta and Anthem and pretty much any other game, beta seems to mean ‘demo’ to people these days!
---
We yelled and begged for no character transfers
---
‘Tagging’ with only a few shots shouldn’t count period. For SBQ only the top three or five contributors get legendary rewards, the rest get a stimpak and a few fluxes that’s all. 
---
The game already scale creatures based on players levels, if someone still have to hide behind others but also want to rake in the loot, well the wasteland shouldn’t be a place for people like that to survive and thrive. 
---
Because a bunch of players ‘share’ one legendary ghoul, Bethesda has to dish out many legendary items for that ONE creature. Does the ghoul’s health regenerate eight times for the eight taggers? Nope. This is just wrong. This is likely one reason why the quality of Legendaries loot is shit now. 
---
I’ve seen countless times a bunch players simply hide in holes and only pew pew a few pipe rounds at the scorchbeast queen, yet after others took down the queen they complained loudly about their not so great loot as if Bethesda owes them an apology. It’s such a shit comedy if you record their entire ‘gameplay’. 
---
Sharing and coop is great, but only contributing a few rounds per creature yet getting equal loots and XP rewards as the top contributor is socialism in a game world and it won’t last. 
---
That works both ways. I have both a sniper and a melee. I lure people to my camp that is mostly concrete foundations and walls. It is a small maze. It allows my melee to move around and not be in LOS of snipers. If a sniper wants me they have to close the distance. If I want to be on the offensive then I wait until players are inside a zoned building. Snipers suck indoors. 
---
As a sneak sniper I just wait near spawn areas and high traffic areas. I try to use the terrain to make the closing distance as difficult as possible. It is not always from an elevated spot. Throw a few mines down and/or set your camp there and trap the area heavily. Even Punji boards will sometimes make people hesitate rushing. I only need a few shots with a 308 to take down most players. 
---
Cheers sir, very eloquently stated! I agree with your assessment,  it's a very large, open ended world where you get out of it the effort you put into it. 
---
I hope they let us use the existing display case for this. Or will it be atom shop stuff. 
---
Easier to detect while sneaking and stinking
---
It's brutal
---
The Shishkebab did but think they broke it in the patch 
---
Psn is mfundercover 
---
I use an anti armor power fist when working through the protectrons. i went flying too the first time after the patch where they all began exploding immediately.  now i have to make sure i'm paying super close attention to the tags before sneaking up behind them for a rebar surprise.
---
I agree with the Sentinel/Assassin change, the idea that those are put together is crazy to me still.  I wish they would have implemented a level cap for each server (1-20, 21-40, etc) which would have helped address a lot of the issues.
---
Nope, this would have happened either now or in a few weeks time without character transfer.
---
The whole point of bonus xp is to benefit new pkayers, it doesn't help level 200s at all.  So if the mode is supposed to have a benefit for low level guys... but low level guys stand no chance... who wins here?  The trolls who just want to spawn camp low level guys?  Fuck them.
---
All of this, and please. For the love of anything good and right in this world and all others.
---
Make. Favorite. Items. Unscrappable.
---
I scrapped my rifle while quickly scrapping two dozen other weapons when the direction the selection bar moved in suddenly reversed (a separate and also awful issue) but it wouldn't have been a problem if this one thing people have been asking for over the past couple of months had been implemented. It is too easy to scrap things you need, and "go slower and pay attention" isn't an answer in a game that recognized the need for a fast scrap junk button. No one is going slow when they can and do carry thirty crap weapons for the scrap table. 
---
I do a circuit around toxic valley.  
---
All kinds of fallen trees there.
---
Bonus: bleached dogwood for a water filter.
---
Agreed.  The brewing is cool and all but this is just nuts.  I don't want to spend ALL my time brewing.
---
Also, survival mode challenges taking up slots in adventure mode games (i.e. less dailies/weeklies for people who aren't into PVP) needs to end.  Give survival a separate challenge list.
---
You're not being "loyal" by buying anything and everything when not on sale. Were you entirely unaware that sales happen? This sort of thing happens even in real life. Either you wait patiently, or spend more and get it now.
---
I hope we can use the existing display case. Or will this be atom shop stuff? Has that part of it been data mined?
---
I love handing out "FREE WATOGA!" fliers!
---
I pick up about 60 at a time any time I'm near the terrorist's hide out :)
---
How does one transfer stuff to a mule anyway? Have a friend do the transferring? 
---
Just a heads up, you mean Charleston, which is the state capital.  Charles Town is located in the eastern panhandle, near Harpers Ferry but is not in Fallout 76. 
---
&gt; Dude, thats the whole point, this isnt free to play, its a buy to play title and to have so high prices for cosmetics in such a title that most people already paid 40+ €/$ for is really scummy. 
---
It a live service, not single player or something like that. Do you see Blizz giving on their live services a shit tons of premium currency? No they don't. Just like in here, same way in Overwatch you don't just get free skins. To get free skins you have to be active. If you aint, you don't get a sh#t. 
---
&gt; ESO gives you login rewards that are accumulative, basically every single month you can get atleast one pet, sometimes a mount, many different other useful items including a shitton of gold and rarely even really epic stuff that will later cost a lot more in the shop, just for logging in ... 
---
But how many times do they give you premium currency? None of them give you that. You get ingame currency for login everyday, that is nothing like getting premium currency. And in ESO, even if you get skin or mount from cashshop, you need to login every day and even then, you can't choose what mount you get. Here you can do same, be active 30 day, but after being active 30, you are given chance to choose what you spend it.
---
&gt; Which would get more people to enjoy the skins and them more money in the end, everyone wins, your point is? 
---
Why would they spend more money if they have already enough Atoms to buy everything they want from playing the game. Only reason people would spend money on Atoms right now is that they might be on short Atoms for limited time item, but when items costs so little as 190 atoms, no one going to be short.
---
&gt; Who talks about every second day? 
---
Yea, they don't release every second day a skin, but with pace they have been releasing skins, I would have bought all the skins already with that 190 atoms ea. This cash shop would be same ridiculous as Venezuela currency.
---
&gt; WoW is subscription based and basically all cosmetics are ingame and free anyway 
---
What wtf are you talking about.... WoW has cashshop, selling Mounts and Pets, starting from 10$ to 30$ and you have no way to earn premium currency to buy those items.
---
&gt; Dude, that makes you shallow and without restraint and says only something about you and not the prices in any way. 
---
If items costs 190 Atoms and I have 10 000 atoms, it is not like I am short in atoms. ofc I am going to buy even useless items. Its like "hey, here is a free item, want?", ofc I am going to accept it, even if I don't like it. It is not like I am losing anything.
---
Yeah if this is the way it was for me I wouldnt have any issues. But it seemed everyone i was coming across regardless of their level was instadeathing me. In fact most of them were under 60. And i couldnt seem to do any damage to them. I was one shotting peolle the day before yesterday. So im just confused as to why it changed for me but not for other people. I have had some people stating its balance. But if thats the case why low are some people still one shotting with automatic weapons and unkillable?
---
How would they have OP gear in 2 to 3 Weeks ? .. Duping is the reason everyone has OP gear - If Survival was Set up that you have to start over with a new Character .. That means no one could BUY op gear from the market .. it means RNG would again play hell with most people .. I don't see everyone having OP gear in 2 to 3 weeks..  
---
Exactly .. 
---
It's good that you can recognize that, so many players expect game modes to be changed just for them even if they're not the target audience.
---
you now shall be die
---
You forgot option 3, level locked servers.  Low levels play together, high levels play together... everyone wins
---
Just send you the friend request 
---
Does that make it last longer? I have had really inconsistent results with paper bags / containers. I have left paper bags and come back hours later to still find them there. 
---
I’d love to see the area beyond the river near the food processing Workshop.
---
Dipshit, where in my post do you see any mention of a level 20? And even if you change it to 50, no they don't. From level 50 on level has shit to do with your legendary gear, all that matters is how long you dedicate to farming shit alongside pure luck. A level 200 that has spent all of their time farming events for cosmetics doesn't mean shit against a level 50 that lucks into a bloody explosive weapon. 
---
Yeah I'm not sure man, sounds different than what I was experiencing and we are running similar builds.  Hmmmmm.
---
Your comments dont jibe with a ton of other comments and experiences posted here and elsewhere...perhaps survival mode is more about what you, yourself, bring to the table? Seems a lot of folks got on just fine with other randoms, but they had to also be chill and open. I'm guessing you went in with weapons drawn, sneaking around spawn locations?  
---
As for having to walk everywhere, perhaps you should try that? If you don't you'll miss out on hundreds of unmarked locations and content...just like other FO games. 
---
Some people play 10+ hours a day.  With the knowledge everyone has now on where to farm and how to level fast (including the 20% buff) it would not take long to get a character farming drops and getting the items they need to PVP again.
---
Perhaps saying 'all the new characters' was an exaggeration on my part, most of the player base would have basic gear/legendaries.
---
Power fist would be the best if you dont consider legendaries. 
---
I think Nuclear Winter will be a winter version of Appalachia 
---
I don’t know if that’s true any longer.  I have BOS 1,2 and last night got BOS 4 without ever getting BOS 3
---
Then why is making a new character even an option in survival?  If they wanted it all to be high level players then that should be a requirement.  Or like I keep saying just make level locked servers so players of a similar level play together
---
Uh, do you know what Morse is? OP is saying the clock might be blinking a message in Morse. 
---
people like you ruined this game from before release. Fallout76 turned into a tea-party from day instead a post apocalypse experience
---
I went to the vault several times last night during my 5 hour session and didn't see anyone there (I was running around the map due to a bounty) I ran into a few low levels at the overseers camp and gave them stimpacks.   Not sure what all the fake news is about lol
---
I love fallout. Never lost anything before didn't really believe other ppl but now has happened to me still use PA because well PA is great and as I said jetpack also have jetpack for x-01 plus it’s a melee build and PA adds strength this toon is lvl 255 another toon lvl 36 is stealth melee another toon lvl 40 is stealth sniper
---
Some guy got an answer by Bethesda saying they don’t have the tools to fix it 
---
Yes very soon it will be a shit show for nothing except for weekly legendary drills and syringers.
---
Except noobs who just bought the game, everyone will empty their caps and aids before going in so nobody’s going to be rewarded for their kills. Better just use melee ‘cause bullets are expensive when you know everyone is wearing duped magic armors. 
---
Bunch of fools all standing still deathclawing each other hard over nothing, isn’t that something to behold in a wasteland setting. 
---
👍 good luck skeleton 
---
ITS👏A👏BETA👏
---
I was playing survival for a bit yesterday and crouched in a bush to go afk for a few minutes, came back and 3 ghouls were wandering past me, about 5 feet away, and didn't notice me.
---
Yep, it's nice that everyone can tag.  That having been said 9 out of 10 times no one else shows up.
---
That is beautiful. How long did that even take? I haven't tried building around natural obstacles, but I would imagine it would be quite an annoyance.
---
It's amazing how BGS didn't even think to put a safe zone around the 1 place you're allowed to travel to. DAYZ had a safe zone around their traders back in the day. Have they done ZERO research on how these games work?
---
Same. Kinda takes the fun out. 
---
I mean what did you really expect from a trash game Fallout 76 is a heaping stinking massive pile of shit
---
Well it might if all duped material had been removed. 
---
But indeed, now might be the good time to try pvp in adventure mode. Didn't think about that actually^=^
---
Yes, which makes it hard if you have no friends playing the game. If that's the case, here is the setup with a second account (not my comment, would link to the original, but I can't with the mobile app I'm using to read reddit right now):
---
"I'm on PC - I just run two logins of FO76 on my single computer in borderless windowed mode and alt-tab between them. If you go into the FO76 folder and open it using the Fallout76.exe file, it prompts you for your account login. So I just have a shortcut to that on my desktop, run it once, log in with main account, run it again, log in with second account, join parties, then do "play as team" to find a suitable world that has multiple open slots."
---
This will introduce the entire server first going to sleep, then playing a banjo, then collectively taking a shit before they fast travel to the SBQ Event when it appears.
---
A nuke launched and with it, millions of toilet bowels screamed out in agony.
---
That was fast! Thx
---
Exactly everyone has OP gear. If it's a fresh start not everyone will be carrying them. They should add like a barrier no weapons or armor outside of survival allowed just in case.
---
That was really helpful, thanks!
---
In my personal experience, while you can find them the same place(s) you find reliable legendary enemies (albeit much more rarely) the best way to reliably get a starred legendary is by doing events. 
---
Think of last week's Fasnacht mission. Every. Single. Fasnacht. ended with a Starred Legendary Megasloth. There's a ton of event missions (Uranium Fever, Hordes, etc.) that work just like that where you do a thing and the final boss is a starred legendary. Yes, some areas will work this way too where the boss mob is a starred legendary, too. But it's the events which will reliably generate starred legendaries.
---
Now this is risky in Survival because events -- especially if that's the only real way to reliably get starred legendaries -- draw the risk of running into other players all of whom are out to kill you. But hey they didn't call it Survival mode because it was easy.
---
I got the bubble but can't craft the skin for my shotgun it doesn't show up in my weapon bench.
---
This is simply short sighted.  
---
Say they do as you ask. However, what happens in few days? Two weeks? New players are in the same boat, and nothing changed.
---
Currently have the same issue and in contact with their support team. Here is their reason why and their steps to resolving but quick FYI these steps did **not** work for me but including them in case it works for someone else:
---
 After looking further into your account I was able to figure out your issue. You made an ESO account under the username : (MyUsername). It also seems you made an account with Bethesda.Net but have not finished setting up your username for this account. I will provide you instructions on finishing that account to change that weird string of numbers and letters.
---
1.	Go to you login screen on the Bethesda Launcher.
---
2.	Under the blue login button you can find, forgot password and forgot username.
---
3.	Make sure to select forgot username.
---
4.	From here you will be prompted to finish verifying your quick account.
---
5.	Once the account has been verified, you may use that account's username to login the Bethesda Launcher.
---
Hope this helps someone!
---
Seems like it would be a nice and easy addition (like the “no scraping or selling favorites” suggestion).
---
I like the FO4 perk system better anyway - it just make sense that I forget and relearn skills by swapping a card. Is there a card collecting and swapping economy that’s sprung up?
---
Or you could have started a new character for survival or something.
---
I notice that your reddit login is only a few days old...meaning you either got banned and have sour grapes or you're a too much of a coward to use your main...so which is it? 
---
Why is new character even optional in Adventure Mode? Maybe I am so good, that being high level is boring to me and I want thing to be even harder, so I create new character.
---
I was in survival mode. Nearest Respawn point would have Whitesprings.
---
Just like the beta they had in November to fix bugs..oh wait.. They put the word beta on it so they can use it as an excuse for the idiotic choices they made.
---
This has to be the best camp I have ever seen
---
Can you maybe link you perks and gear for me so i can compare?
---
Thanks! Unfortunately the only friend I have that plays works nights and I do days so we rarely play together send I'm on ps4 so looks like no mules for me!  
---
I'd be +1 for better NPC AI/Tactics &amp; loadouts even in adventure mode.
---
But making survival a Rust clone isn't a good idea.
---
We do need a mode where we can pile into a lobby and fight as factions teams in the towns/cities/places that are on the map.
---
Basically team based battles in Morgantown, Charleston, Watoga etc...
---
Nothing lore based just pew-pews
---
They had the last laugh perk equipped before the virus got them.
---
I really don't understand that part, why a penalty? Isn't having to walk back across the map penalty enough? Killing a player should be just like killing a monster and have regular drops. Anything else just leads to people exploiting.
---
Still not sure how it works bot sometimes when a player you kill respawns they get about 20sec of invulnerability which ends on time out or when they attack you.
---
It doesn’t always trigger but it’s happened some. 
---
Does it give the option to respawn vs revenge on death? Maybe that’s where the difference is.
---
Would actually be interesting to set up a group of players who would play as a Bank of the Wasteland. Players who want to try survival would deposit their aid items and caps with a member of the bank before entering Survival mode and then retrieve them after exiting for a modest fee. Defaults caused by the bank not paying back the member would be covered by the accumulated fees. Deposits and paybacks would be documented by screenshots. A subreddit or separate website would be needed to post the documentation.
---
I drop mine in the two trash cans outside the crafting room at the Whitespring.
---
Wow. So I stopped playing this game for various reasons. But bravo. This is one huge step in the right direction.
---
Can you link your build and armor  so i can compare it to mine?
---
Oh?...
---
Luminous Apparatus for Moth Provisions
---
So why is it given as an option?  Maybe some of us want to experience the game again in a new mode without first replaying it all again in adventure, doing all the same exact shit the same exact way.  If we want to play new characters in survival that should be possible with a more level playing field.  Either that or required level 50+ characters to play the new mode at all.  It's like you can't see things from anyone's perspective but your own 
---
Every. Single. Time. These threads are all over the 76 page now. And it's always the same. If you people would read some threads. The experience used to be much worse. Yeah, you don't understand what all the hate was about because you didn't experience the game /creating/ that hate. If you'd have bought the game at or near release, you'd understand. You don't. 
---
I'm as glad as anyone you're having a good time, honestly, and I really hope to return to the game and enjoy it some time in the near future. But you didn't experience the clusterfuck we did so don't come telling us we were blowing things out of proportion.
---
 are you saying that the Energy damage was effective against you, wearing sentinel? 
---
Use a friend or a second account 
---
Yeah, I agree that allowing any transfers at all between adventure and survival modes was dumb, but it's Bethesda after all. They should disallow any and all transfers (characters, items, weapons, etc.) And then do periodic resets with "seasons" like the Diablo people do.
---
Have both dense and rank 2 foreproof doesnt seem to help me for some reason. Allthough it did the day before yesterday.
---
Ah well I'm at work now but when I get home in like 5 hours lol.  I'm 15 str, 10 endurance, 11 agility, 4 charisma, 1 perception and uh 10 or 11 luck I remember that.  Not running dodgy, but running as many damage resist perks as possible including the one for while sprinting.  Running serindipity also.  This is all off memory at the moment
---
There was a fellow running around last night just merking everything with a TSE Shotgun.  You like to be instagibbed within 15 feet or get really fucked up further away?  Look no further fam. 
---
It’s called having a discussion and suggesting things and ideas to Bethesda who regularly check the reddit.
---
What’s annoying are people like you who come in and post nothing in regard to the topic at hand.
---
Dang, I've got a bloodied explosive lever too and thought I had all the perks, but my base damage at just below 20% is around 500. I am missing adrenal reaction though.
---
I thought it was funny, I crouch to chameleon as soon as I load in, and often times someone would FT in on top.of me. Take two steps back, headshot, lol.
---
Not working as intended, I think.
---
What level are you?
---
Darn Florida Man
---
Thing is you have to account for the fact htat people are dicks. It's an unfortunate reality of MP games (and why I in general don't like them unless I can avoid players. The few games that this is different is regular Fallout 76 cause people are in general nice or just ignore you and Monster Hunter which is a pure co op game).
---
I actually don’t have a problem with the trap setting. I do agree with you though that the top person shouldn’t be just based on time. If you base it on kills you could run into the problem of only a few people doing pvp over and over while the others ignore it. I for one know I would ignore it unless stumbling across a player while playing the story. So I think time, pvp kills, xp gained, all of the stats should contribute to who is number 1. But at the same time if I happen to be in the top 3 unintentionally by just questing I shouldn’t have to risk a lot of my aid items and caps. Which is why in my original post I think when you get to that point it shouldn’t cost you anything upon death but should still give out a reward for players killing you in pvp. This way you are able to have the markings to initiate pvp for the people who want to do solely that, but for people like me wanting to do the story and wander around they aren’t getting severely punished upon death when pvp is forced upon them.
---
I also am friendless. Would friend you so we could help each other, but I'm on PC.
---
Florida Man...
---
Its not just feedback, there were posts on this subreddit when Survival was announced warning about a fair few of the issues being reported now.
---
I have no idea how your internal structure is laid out but if players who have shreds of information can foresee the problems then:  
---
(a) Somebody on the dev team may have voiced it already and not been listened to. (relatively easy to solve)  
---
(b) Issues were brought up but could not be fixed for the deadline. (relatively easy to solve)   
---
(c) Nobody internally saw the issues. (far harder to solve)
---
Either-way to make up for the bad PR at launch the only way forward is consistently good updates with minor flaws, not the foundational stuff that Survival now has.
---
They definately did get the last laugh - Couldnt even fidn the body after I retrieved my scrap bag
---
that is true, but in my situation i actually had to go back in settings and disable pacifist mode, so i think it was actually a but. Hasnt happened to me since that time, though
---
I’m level 77 with the chameleon mutation and a 1* AA hunting rifle and consistently led my server in kills / longest life/time wanted 
---
I'm on PS4 mainly. Is it the long reconscope or the other one? Maybe it was due to me not putting the long recon on it.
---
Didn’t know that i can block the restart i will do that as soon as i can get windows up again
---
I don’t think anything is overheating since I can play other games even with higher requirements all day long without a bosd 
---
We seem.to have the exact same special distribution. 
---
Damn so close to having a friend to
---
Yeah that's 5 months of patches friend.  Three months ago the servers were crashing due to mass duping amongst many other issues.
---
True, but at the very least all these "survival is broken" or "survival is fine stop whining" post seem to miss that bgs has said it's Survival *beta* 
---
Whether you love it or hate it they clearly want *suggestions* on how to get it just right
---
Plz don't think I'm snapping at you, I just see so many of those bitchy posts, it's a little aggravating.
---
Barring bgs doing some tomfoolery like "this is *totally* a beta, you guys" and not listening to anything anyone says, 
---
We need to give them time to understand what works and what don't work.
---
I just found it. Go to the north edge of the airport, where the vegetable garden is. Standing in the pumpkin patch, look north-northeast and there's a low rock face with a chain link fence on top of it. Behind that fence is the cemetery.
---
i agree survival mode sounds like what you described, Bethedsa should change of the exiting survival mode to deathmath or something
---
Y-17 trauma harness 
---
make sure your pipboy light isnt on!
---
500-1000 caps id guess
---
That’s a nice change of pace compared to most cases of spawn camp farming.
---
At least it wasn't an orbital strike beacon.
---
I don't think you can say PvP is forced, when you're in a server that is specifically for it. 
---
Yeh that helps. You need all the rifle perks, demolition expert, nerd rage and bloody mess.. Then there are the vats accuracy and critical perks  to help. People investing to much in armor rather than a decent weapon set. I have bloodied for everyone lol, exterminator for other bloodied and an instigating for vanguards. There's something for everyone in my inventory.
---
Don't forget to throw a grenade and vats it for a little surprise. Run and drop mines, grenades etc. Leave your power armor behind to lol, that shit is worthless even with all the modifications. 
---
So when the queen dies the event is over correct?  So while you're waiting 10 minutes for the wheel of death so you can grab your loot from the queen some clown is going to kill you 12 times?  Hey if you guys enjoy it more power to you.
---
Use the windows install medium to boot and try repairing that way. Note that your system may have gotten corrupted and only full reinstall could help.
---
As for the BSOD when playing Fallout: it tends to overwork your videocard in an unique fashion that can result in GPU not responding errors or monitors turning completely off. Try lowering the GPU/VRAM frequency by 50-100 MHz via MSI Afterburner or similar tools.
---
We can still be friends on reddit 🤗
---
“But the duped weapons and armor don’t make a difference” 
---
Except if you are a lvl 22 killing high level players on a regular basis 
---
I'm not sure of this myself, now you mention it... I was wandering in Whitespring and the lvl 68 ghouls didn't see me standing beside them, but then I went back to Charleston and the lvl 1 Scorched at Poseidon kept spotting me a mile away?? 
---
ITT we should be able to trade cards with each other, or at least get the option for some kind of reshuffle. Like dump all your unwanted cards and be guaranteed different variants or ones you don't have. 
---
Tbh, I've kinda suspected the perk card packs are broken somehow, they always seem to give me repeats consistently.
---
Okay but if you sit to long you get a debuff from losing all of the blood in your legs
---
I guess I just rustled his jimmies ;-)
---
Unfortunately, you have to trust a friend to hold it, and hope he stuck around to give it back to you on a different character.  
---
Awe now I do have a friend! Thanks friend! 
---
I think, after much trial and error, ESO nailed it.
---
Damage is normalized, but gear and skills set high level characters apart. Not so much, however, that a new character can't participate.
---
Loot drops scale to level, keeping players on the hunt for new gear. 
---
Overland/dungeon bosses require teamwork.
---
I think Fallout would benefit from the same *sort* of model. Not identical, but... taking the better parts of it, and making them "fallout" would be awesome.
---
This is the FO76 community. No what kind of turd Bethesda deposits on their doorstep, they'll do mental gymnastics to make it seem like a blueberry pie.
---
Don’t know your standard for ‘decent’ but there are still good drops from time to time. Now after several patches it seems they randomized it a lot and nerfed hot locations where youtubers brag about. RobCo used to be an honest place where three star gutsys dropped three star items. Now it’s just one star wood legs most of the time. 
---
All of my good drops lately came from unexpected areas I don’t go very often, while nothing but shit armors and walking canes from WS and RobCo. 
---
10-15k caps depending on how many people also want it. Easily see WTB posts offering 10k for one, so that is your low end competition.
---
Eh, those are normally all out fights. We see people camping areas and just join in. Protip don't keep respawning if you're dying right there 
---
When you speak of roboco or west tek, is that external, internal, or combined?
---
If only quad could be paired with furious.   Sigh.  
---
But I was "Loyal" playing lot of days to accumulate those Atoms, while player who was playing Apex, comes and plays few days, gets 1500 atoms and buys same things that took me maybe weeks if not months. 
---
Yes sales happens, but do you see in real life things to drop from 700$ to 150$ in weeks. Well weeks is too harsh, use year. Even in year, you don't see console or Smartphone price drop that much. I haven't seen beer price dropping for years, it rather goes up. GTA5 took 5 years to drop to 10$. If you bought each item in that bundle individually, it would cost you close to 7000 atoms, Id understand that everything in that bundle was discounted -30%, that would made sense or content that was in it was year old. Look the camo PA, that has been since release- 30% off, that makes sense. 
---
Btw I purchased this pack as well and the reason I did was to get the paint for the shotty 
---
180 but the last like 60 levels were re-allocating special points and getting new perks.  Used to be a full on Power armor user lol.  I lose almost 400 caps per death lol
---
I dig it! If you have any budget left I’d suggest some wall art in the bar to spruce it up a bit bit either way, it’s very cool and not the kind of boxes I normally make :)
---
Did you even TRY to play the game...or just power level to get to the "end game content"? There is plenty of story here, you just have to go get it it isn't spoon fed to you. I've got nearly 500 hours in, the vast majority solo, but I've also team played many portions of it. There are as many unmarked locations as marked, perhaps slow down a bit and go explore some? Just like every other FO, the real beauty of the game is not the main line but the off track.
---
Totally new players who are familiar with the Fallout franchise will automatically search bodies. They might not recognize paper bags as being loot-bearing straight out of the vault.
---
&gt;Do you see Blizz giving on their live services a shit tons of premium currency?
---
This is the only one i will reply to, because its clear you have no idea what you are talking about... have you even played any of the games you try to use as "bad" examples?
---
Literally everything in HotS is free and can be earned with a few hours of passive play or some luck, you can "buy" everything you want with ingame currency and never have to buy a dime.
---
SC2 and Diablo 3 are not really GAAS games, but since you want to go that route, they got multiple free additions and regular seasonal content with a few big extras here and there and no MTX cosmetics at all.
---
Hearthstone is TCG which is basically a Gacha Machine and like all TCG games horrible when it comes to monetization.
---
And then we have WoW, which has basically everything "free" since you pay for it with your subscription and the few things you can buy are never the least necessary and more the "super premium" things that no one really needs because the base variety is already enormous.
---
Just let it be, your point is moot and your opinion is your own, but its a horribly skewed one...
---
Lol that's funny actually because I'm just winging it and like I said in my other reply it's a pretty recent build for me.  Used to have no agility because many of it's perks are useless for PA builds imho
---
Yeh 600. Its beautiful, I stop levelling my character when I heard about survival mode as I knew that would happen lol. 
---
The problem behind top three being most kills per life is that it is a huge disincentive to engage in pvp at all. Player markers based on being wanted makes sense. Alternatively, if rewards are being given out for any particular category on the leader board, then those top people should be marked too
---
Interesting idea. Maybe like a 500 cap minimum to join a survival server and if you get to zero and a player kills you, it boots you to adventure until you get to 500 again.
---
Yeah, this myth that new characters only would limit all the high end or "OP" builds is hilarious.
---
It would just delay them. Which is not a solution. 
---
is that a solution or a workaround?  spawn camping shouldn't be a thing...
---
I got a a level 419 last night and it was awesome, I left his junk and aid, the caps were sufficient enough, especially when he came looking for me in the gold club and I got him again.. Haha. Or her, who really knows. 
---
There’s nothing wrong with criticizing a game you like
---
I'm really not sure about ranges, sorry but I was wondering last night if something has changed with V.A.T.S. damage?
---
I also use rifles and I was at Whitespring, taking potshots at ghouls. If I aimed using the scope and landed a solid headshot, it took about 1/3 health, sometimes less - which has been my experience so far. If I used V.A.T.S. it was one-shot \_every single time\_ - which hasn't been my experience so far.
---
Additionally I was killing a lvl 68 Charred Ghoul with 4 V.A.T.S. headshots from my 10mm pistol... which has NEVER happened before?
---
I agree, Conan Exiles is one of my favourites of these genres and their pricing is mostly really ok-ish, some things are still kinda overpriced in my opinion but its worlds better than what Bethesda offers :/
---
A couple of weeks? 
---
Boat loads of players would be running around with them in a matter of days.
---
Love horde events, but why in the heck do hordes have to go through areas they are too low level for.  So sick of finding a roaming horde of rad rats that are level 15 to 18 dead before i spawn in because a level 91 glowing death claw is eating them.  Also for the love of fido, fix the dang mongrel models in the hordes.  Nothing says fun like fighting 20 ft long stick figures you cannot hit, and have ragdoll physics that can make them fly away on death.
---
Another asslicking post...
---
I didn't say spawn camping should be a thing. It's pretty shitty but you can avoid it if you just don't spawn there. And I know not every spawn is being camped app the time. 
---
like i said the only thing im against it being forced to restart from scratch as long I don't have to do that im happy
---
On top of, as in just sitting on the roof?
---
Make a new character and transfer your caps to that character then put all of your aid items at that character. After you do that, you can go and do pop with your main character.
---
Yeh played for a total of 6-7 hours in the new mode and I'm at 21k and have way to many aid items. Y
---
There seems to be a lot of high level players in PA and it doesn't end well for them. I think Bethesda needs to introduce some new PA for that kind of player because as it stands PA is pretty useless against most other builds. 
---
Would you mind explaining how? My understanding is that you wouldn't be able to dupe them or transfer them from adventure. No one is going to have caps in survival and it will take a great deal of trust that someone wont gun you down for their money back if you try to sell stuff. 
---
Seems to be a pretty standard build for unarmed. Im at work for awhile to, but  Since our builds seem to be pretty identical, Would you be willing to meet up with me in game later on and help me test some of this stuff? 
---
Fresh characters would matter for what? A few days?
---
In days many people will have logged a boat load of hours.....
---
Yea, I got disconnected 3 times, staying on for maybe 2-5 minutes at a time.  One time I rejoined there were 3 Scorchbeast above the Whitespring...
---
Never said all of them were removed just all the copies, tse is amazingly easy to counter flame proof and dense thats it 1 perk and 1 mod you could acquire that in literally one day if you think that's hard I don't know what to tell you
---
Looks like that's off the fan fiction wiki. I don't think its ever been mentioned in canon before. 
---
Hah, I actually used to live there for a while so I could harvest the Lead deposit.
---
Sure did. Tried playing no man's sky as well what's about the same level of exploring and farm... neather are good games imo.
---
And that you're able to do anything at all doesn't change the fact that it's a horrible, horrible mmo.
---
I dont listen to 'gamers' any more. There is so much weird cog motive bias that goes into these big hate jerks. Reddit hated on even Skyrim (like, hard) back when it came out, and guess what? It's one of the most iconic games of all time. 
---
It's true my fully modded t51 means shit, I'm dying like some lvl 1 poor thing. Tbh I'm not surprised, those guys with this kind of builds waited for this for so long. And now it's paying off literally. I don't care really, but salt is down there on the bottom tho...
---
There's another bug with the bundle. It doesn't show for the hunting rifle or pump action shotguns despite the description :/
---
Legendaries is what makes fallout 76 fun have why would you want to remove them?
---
Vintage tick blood tequila also restores health along with hunger
---
It's not perfect, don't get me wrong, but the difference between getting spawnpeeked from a lvl 295 with duped items and a lvl 100 in non duped items is very, very minimal.
---
That's why I still think a level cap is the only practical way to fix this problem. 
---
Hi...I have one. 4K and it's yours
---
I don't know if you have much experience with MMOs (buT ItS nOt an MmO!), but based on my experience with playing several right around their launch, 76 was pretty smooth. Sure, there are lots of disconnections and crashes. Other games have those too, along with hours long login queues. Bugged quests, balance issues, exploits, lack of long term endgame content? None of those are uncommon for the launch/first few months of MMOs. The problem was 100% people's expectations. Between the people who go into any new fallout game looking to hate it (because it isn't NV), increased in this case because it wasn't the single player fallout 5 they wanted, even though nobody expected fallout 5 for at least several more years, the you tubers getting clicks off anything negative, people that never played it jumping on the hate train just to be bandwagons, and the outrage towards the game/developers over out-of-game controversies that they had no control over, like quality of licensed merchandise by third party vendors (as if 90% of game tie-in merchandise and collectors edition bonuses hasn't *always* been kind of garbage), it's kind of like everybody ignored the fact that the game is exactly what was promised. I went in, from day one, expecting bugs, expecting the content to be something that would be added and changed over time, expecting instability, both because that's what you says get with mmo launched, and because that's exactly what Todd Howard said to expect when the first announced the game.
---
If interested..add me pirateglenn1 on ps4
---
Disconnects and freezing are still a problem. Can't find any statements from Bethesda addressing these issues. Getting the impression it's being ignored.
---
If you’re playing out of a sense of loyalty and not because you’re having fun, you’re doing something wrong. 
---
I appreciate this. I'm not so much looking for legendary weapons, but high level enemies.
---
Monster Mash is spectacular for number of high level spawns, maybe even better than whitesprings.
---
Well, it states, clear as day, that it's for hunting rifles and pump action shotguns...
---

---
It happens when the door fails to load.  Usually upon log in or fast travel.  
---
You can wait a couple minutes and see if it loads or hop again and wait a few more minutes.  
---
Explain what is unbalanced everything has a counter in this game if you don't know it you don't know the game mechanics, maybe some things need tweaking but you dont need to remove legendaries from the game its literally the best part of the game
---
It is an issue that they are aware of and are looking into it.
---
PvP isn’t what was ruining the game, it’s the fact that people like your friend and yourself duped or help move thousands of duped items which in turn caused instability of the servers across the bored. Personally I hope the likes of you never get unbanned or as you say unsuspended.  You turned what I believe is a good game that could have had a flourishing in game economy and you ruined it through unchecked duping and exploiting for your own gain. Again legitimate players are tired of hearing about the cheaters “begging” to come back and potentially ruin the game again. 
---
&gt; beta seems to mean ‘demo’ to people these days!
---
Blame the devs. When they release a "beta" 2 weeks before release, that's not a beta, it's a demo. Ain't shit gonna change before the game launches
---
Missed out on a few Fasnacht events because of this. I wish this would be resolved.
---
He was my favourite!
---
This is common, its usually just unequipped.  It wasn’t in your inventory?
---
Yeah, no dice for me either. I was verified. Hmmmmm. How odd.
---
How many caps
---
How are people going to be running around with high end armour/gear?
---
There's a limited number of types of Legendaries and a 6-8 hour farming session   nets you a ton of Legendaries. 
---
Who cares about selling them? I don't. Rarely do. I drop most of my Legendary drops and I'm level 68. 
---
What's the difference between farming in survival and adventure? Very little
---
5 euro
---
Yeah you on PC?  Maybe add me on discord so I'm more likely to not forget lol.
---
Zalinto#6870
---
I have a bloodied explosive handmade I can use to test range out as well to see if you're negating ranged damage or not too.
---
I got masks. IGN: SteelTownErick
---
Allso all my stuff
---
Right, I'm not saying they have to play the game. But if a 'friend' can't hop on once for 2 minutes to help out, that seems like a lame friend.
---
You must not have very good friends...
---
I went on a run last night and had the luck of the legendary gods on my side, there were 4 on ground level in Watoga, 1-3*. None of them had great loot unfortunately. All exploded, two of those explosions ended up killing me, but all their robot corpses stayed where they exploded and I was able to loot. 
---
Thanks so much for replying. Had a feeling it was gonna be high lol. I was think around 10,000 so thank you for confirming that.
---
It is! LOL I am sorry you had a shitty time tho. what's your armor loadout?
---
Honestly sentinel cav sets dont bother me anti armor helps alot. But even so usual weapons fo just fine to. 
---
In caps not real money
---
Thanks, I’ll update it. 
---
I dont have any friends playing at the moment, so it happens. 
---
No im on ps4 damnit haha.
---
Tick blood tequila margaritas only do healing while melee and can cause disease while tick blood tequila sunrise only provides hunger relief while also having a chance of disease
---
LMG melts em just fine 
---
Ah damn, well maybe someone on PS4 can help I hope
---
Awesome, I’ll update it. 
---
I've only ever gotten the Initiate paint (haven't gotten a single plan drop from Forbidden Knowledge since Wild Appalachia either, which is beginning to annoy me) but got it multiple times, so I'd assume it's a safe bet that you can keep getting them.
---
Great minds my friend!!
---
I have had a lot of problems trying to play since Monday.  The game will load, but it will crash after a few minutes of really low frame rate and most inputs not registering.  But it sounds like many people are having this issue
---
The only other character I've played survival on is a level 51 stealth melee character wearing mistress of mystery regalia and using blade of bastet. And I have way more kills than deaths. It's all about playing smart. 
---
That’s not even the main issue. 
---
I have a regular old pistol with a good scope and I could 1-shot people from afar with no problem. I killed a lot of people who were fighting each other and I made quite a bit of caps. 
---
The main issue I had was the spawn killing. At one point I couldn’t even load into the world without instantly dying. There’s supposed to be a window of immunity, but it doesn’t work as intended. 
---
Shouldn’t the stacking mean you’re protected with 75% fall damage mitigation instead of 100%?
---
You're worried about what you've grinded for, but you would be fine if what "they" grinded for (ass/sent armor) was taken away. Hipocrocy at its core.
---
Yes, thanks for the correction :)
---
Yeah i do this with my wife, but i feel like everyone deserves this ability, not just those of us with enough money to afford 2 ps4s
---
I lost all of my super stimpacks from dying in pve, I had about 70 of them.. I didn't realize until I had logged in next time. 
---
I was wondering why I had so much extra weight, just from a quick glimpse I lost well over 300 aid items.
---
If I was able to store them before adventuring that would be awesome but my stash is almost full too. 
---
agree with the aid drop. Lost 30 stims in 2 deaths a bit annoying. 
---
I like it there. I got a crazy waterfall treehouse thing going on lol. 
---
How does griefing work? In Rust you bust into a base, take their stuff, get it back to your base. You can offline and online raid. Can you actually take all their stuff if you raid a base?
---
Sounds like the legendary balancing I mentioned could apply here. And if you have the time and patience to farm legendaries for several hours while fighting other players probably trying to do the same then good for you. You'll be one of the guys on top who earned it. 
---
Did you read the plan? I have gotten one of each but read them all
---
Sweet tato stew is my favorite healing item with herbivore+healing factor. Who needs stimpaks? 
---
Stagger is a tricky proposition when someone can jack you with a TSE from some distance. 
---
I heard that once you learn them you can't get them again. I believe that to be true even though I have yet to test it.
---
Its the new dupe glitch. Ik how to do it and it requires crashing the server.
---
Others are reporting only starred legendaries count. 
---
I didnt say anything about it being taken away.
---
I get this, I really do. But I think it will pass. Right now, it's new so the mode is basically an orgy of violence but I think once the initial rush passes it will really clear the way for some satisfying game play, even role play. The leaderboard is a big meh for me. I mean, it's fine but I don't like that it shows your location on the map. It's cool to know who's out there, tho.
---
I have an assassins sentinel build and i still dont plan on it. Instead im going to keep selling stimpacks to those who lose them. Ive also been buying alot of weapons for cheap as the economy is making players go broke. I should start a wasteland pawn shop🤔🤔
---
And you get farmed at level 5 by the people who started earlier. Same problem. Seeing as you hit 5 doing the first responders quest Flatwoods would be full of Level 100+ snipers.
---
There are definite pros and cons to the porting of characters, but even if they weren't allowed, it's only a matter of time before they replicate their builds in Survival.
---
It may well be the case that either not having Legendaries period, or only allowing major Legendary effects, would have been the more balanced way to go, but ultimately, I can't figure out what Bethesda's vision for this mode was.  To me, a Survival Mode where it actually takes a bit of time to kill someone would be rather fun.  A proper shootout with lots of cover and dashing around gaming for position.  But no, what we have is instant death that ends a battle before it even begins.
---
Rename survival “one shot with a tse shotgun”. It was fun until that happened...5 times in a row. 
---
That's kinda what I assumed. I was planning to leave one unread so I could get more, but after grinding so hard for the last one I decided to read it and paint my PA
---
I probably wont. Pvp isn't really my thing in all honesty. While it's not something I'll shy away from, it's not my first choice of gameplay. 
---
If I do take the notion (as can happen on occasion) I may, but I highly doubt it. 
---
Haven't yet, mostly due to cost/availability of them. But I would certainly use them if I had em! 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/2u3232/this_never_gets_old/
---
It looks pretty realistic looking!
---
This is true cause I was the 200 cap bounty friend murdering people lol Roadddddd Houseeeee
---
They're removed, though. Also, no one is begging to come back, because we are coming back. I asked for an ETA, thanks for your input though.
---
I was having that problem with drinking a beer and needing to land a critical shot. I literally got the quest monday night and it didn’t work but got on tuesday after the update and it finally worked so i figured the update must have fixed it. May have just been leaving the server or closing the app and reopening fixed it. Give that a try if you haven’t already. Also make sure you are crouched haha, seems simple but i got that same one and i wasn’t crouched at first.
---
I didn’t get Nuka World for free just by playing FO4, though. 
---
I only ever do west tec and sugar grove while keeping an eye out for uranium fever and awol... thanks for the new places to try, I was getting bored ha!
---
It’s still a valid build, it’s just different in a bad way, no “clean” kills for stealth snipers who focus on that.
---
I did a legendary robot yesterday in watoga and it didn't explode on me...
---
I was disappointed. 
---
I think in my previous playtime when I did get to 15, I never found any power armour at all. 
---
It's a shame that the Atom store must exist at all, but here we are, with an entire generation of gamers who have grown to believe paying money for cosmetics is ok.  It's not.  I'm ashamed that the industry has gone this route, especially when companies release broken games to meet deadlines because of - well, more money.
---
I'm having a blast too! I love the tension and random unpredictability of people. These folks complaining about losing all their aid items needed to A: stash what they didn't want lost. Or B: realize that they can get a ton of aid items just by farming people.
---
No, and I go out of my way to avoid PVP in adventure mode because it's seriously broken. There are only a handful of builds that seem to be shredding everything and entire builds and weapon classes are all but useless.  Some really serious balance changes have to happen before I even think about touching it. 
---
No unfortunately I had jumped off of a roof  notice a strange/weird/uncommon sound and was like what the hell was that only to discover left arm gone so that toon will sit for awhile maybe because of patch I don’t know  time to lvl other toons
---
I'm on the last two but after several days of turning in data, I'm probably going to do the same.
---
Gotcha. Obviously i havent been there, but I get the idea. You probably get blindsided with one hits and lose tons of caps and aid. 
---
This game isnt really built for that type of PvP. Bounties are fun, and dueling is cool. Open combat is just going to be a headache unless they drastically chamge the rules.
---
Yeah, read the first one (and painted my t-60 set). Then got several more of the same over subsequent days. Knowing a plan unfortunately doesn't remove it from the loot tables for you.
---
I made a PSA on this earlier. Only STARRED legendary mobs count toward the challenge. That means you either have to spend your entire week server hopping your favorite haunts OR do a bunch of Event quests where the boss is a starred legendary like Uranium Fever or Horde events and risk running into other players.
---
It would give us a reason to collect toilet paper, which IMO would be the most valuable "junk" item a person could find in a real apocalyptic scenario. 
---
I always do my best thinking on The Throne.  +2 to INT for a time after using a toilet or port-a-can.
---
That's really not the solution you're looking for. Even if everyone started fresh, how long would that last? It would only be a couple days before the cream separated itself again. And then all new players moving forward would be just as screwed. 
---
Once you reach a certain point, level doesn't matter but I think a much better solution would be matchmaking. People of a similar level on the same server. Sure you'd be dealing with toons who might be very well equipped but PvP is just as much if not more about build. And a level 25 toon isn't going to have all the perks that make people so tough to kill in PvP. 
---
I agree. It’s not very convient ether. 
---
That was patched ages ago wasn't it?
---
I mean, I have my beliefs, but I ultimately don't care.  When something falls just shy of greatness, it's more frustrating than if they didn't try at all.  This mode is in the latter camp.
---
I know this post is hyperbole but can we have a deathmatch mode? It would be nice to practice gun-play with some consensual no penalties PvP.
---
Oh wow well good to know. Hope you are able to get a different one next time
---
Yeah, I'm crouched and getting the "sneak attack hit for 2.00 x damage" message. When I world hopped all it did was reset the quest to where I had to drink the alcohol again.
---
Are you one shotting the target? I was having issues with it and finding a mob that didn't die after one shot seemed to be the fix for me.
---
As far as I know, it never was a real thing. Just internet hype.
---
Great guide   I too ran into no "griefers" in my time playing.  I ran into some low levels and gave them stimpaks.  Played 5 hours and saw very little of one sided fights, everyone I killed almost killed me and vice versa (or they made me wanted and killed me later).  I killed two guys in power armor at Wes Tek and we laughed in area chat as they stalked me down and killed me for revenge.  I did kill a guy in his camp but he shot first lol, also I left his loot and camp in tact.  Note, don't fast travel to your camp if you're wanted xD
---
If you don't take every in game death as a personal insult, and have some emotional maturity, you will enjoy survival. 
---
I kind of like bounty hunting and dueling in adventure mode tbh. 
---
But the game isnt currently built for open PvP. They would have to drastically change the rules in those servers for it to be enjoyable.
---
I agree. This game isn’t built the way they want us to play survival. 
---
It’s a little exciting to go try and kill people when I want a change of pace, but it’s not where it needs to be balance wise or fairness. 
---
What was the tequila itself? 
---
You may want to try closing out of the game completely
---
I’m sure there are higher level players that acquired their weapons and armor legitimately.  But it’s sort of like the steroids era in baseball.  The simple fact it was allowed (and in some cases celebrated) calls into question any outcome at that point in time.  
---
You know damn well people that played early enough in the game and took advantage of the glitches and dupes are not on the same playing field and never will be.  The only way to solve it is to wipe clean all dupes.  Besthesda messed up by not doing this back in December.  
---
It was never a thing, just a rumor that started circulating. I trade quite often and it's been nothing but a positive experience.
---
It was NEVER a thing... People are just idiots and bitch about anything.
---
Just like being one-shot through slap damage, it is not and has never been a thing.
---
Sorry, I responded in the wrong post. Still though, they shouldn't take anything away.
---
I think it is a glitch if you load in wearing excavator.
---
didnt seem to be. Ill see if i was recording atvthat point.
---
I'm hoping nuclear winter is more like you described.
---
Survival is more like deathmatch or hunger games than an actual survival
---
I got really lucky when it came to getting the first 5, but for Paladin and Elder I ended up having to server hop at Sugar Grove for a few days
---
You had me until you got to the whole thing about having to start a new character and having it locked. It is like meeting a cool new person and then finding out they are an anti vaxer. 
---
Yeah my beta was like that. But me being a rebel didnt follow the quests and just went north.
---
This play through I found an area outside Charleston that always spawns leveled armor. And I went there daily snagging them up around lvl 10. (I thought they were rare so i hoarded then) then I realised they weren't so I started giving them away to newbies.
---
How about no. No. And no.
---
No they shouldn't, but the rules for PvP servers and balance would have to be drastically different that it is in adventure. Basically, ita never going to work.
---
How do you get calibrated shocks for it?
---
Maybe if you get dysentery and don't visit a working toilet you get a bigger debuff. *you've messed yourself -2 Chr -1 int **and you smell** *
---
A mix of 2-3* marine armour some with a mix of bolstering chameleon and weightless and a few other things I think. I'm level 155.
---
You’ll get dumpstered 
---
I love how if you aren't kissing Bethesda's ass and praising Fallout 76, people downvote you to hell. What a circle jerk in here.

Eat my ass lil bitch
---
Dude, I fucking hate PvP in Fallout, I have no interest in Seeing, playing or hearing about it.  I want nothing to do with it.
---
Your post is brilliant.
---
I love how well thought out your response is, the ideas make sense, and you've obviously put a decent amount of thought into the subject.  I still have little interest in PvP, but a lot of what you suggest would get me thinking pretty hard about the idea.
---
Please, continue to research and come up with new thoughts on the issue.  You're one of the few people I've seen around here that has taken a balanced approach to your ideas, and you've got the right attitude to make healthy suggestions that might just be what that mode needs.
---
I've had some ideas about changing the system, but I recognize that I'm a wimp when it comes to PvP, and don't have a balanced view of it (my only real PvP experience was the warlord/grand marshal slog back in the old WoW days, which was team-based only).  I'd love to hear more of your ideas.
---
This is the same for me. I am supposed to drink rum and land a critical.  The critical never registers so the quest doesn't complete. 
---
It happened the other night when I talked to Biv and he gave me that quest as well as another. I completed the other but now I am stuck with this one.
---
Biv won't give me any others and I  can't advance in this quest.  Not real sure what to do.
---
Yeah I noticed this before. I thought maybe it just didn't show up for me because I hadn't bought any premium poses. Was starting to think I didn't actually claim it in the atom store. This atleast brings some solace.
---
It only partially scales with the area.  Cranberry Bog usually yields a 45-50, yes, but The Mire and Savage Divide are often back in the 30s, even though that's more the Ash Heap's speed.
---
thanks, yeah im at 100. im trying to figure out what corners i can cut
---
Jesus you're thicker than a whale omelette. I only responded to your abuse. What a dumbass.
---
Do you know what firearm the guy was using? 
---
Or ya know. Don’t die. 
---
The loot you get from them isn't  better than from regular enemies
---
Level locking is a bad idea. There no helping out the noobs if that becomes a thing. That’s an entire interaction lost. It would be better if they just properly balanced weapons so that in PvP the gap between the op god tier and bottom end is smaller. That way everyone can play together and everyone has a fighting chancev
---
The problem lies in whereas they grinded for it or they just bought one of the thousand duped ones :/
---
THe one-shot death through slap damage definitely was a thing at one point. Some 50+ person one-shot killed me when I was lvl 25-30. This was before the 2-shot/explosive nerf tho.
---
You're an idiot. 
---
I had a 2* charred ghoul explode, never saw it's body again
---
Didn't think of that aspect. Good point.
---
Didn't bobblehead stacking make slap-damage insta-kills possible?
---
Smoking can actually stop the shakes from parkinsons, so maybe if you are addicted it could give a permanent reduction in scope sway? Also being addicted should reduce hunger drop rate, total appetite suppressor. 
---
MTE. I was pissed I spent $60 on a piece of hot garbage and that equates to me blowing things out of proportion? Between the game breaking bugs and lack of any endgame (nevermind the fact that Bethesda screwed over a lot of honest players with rifle builds when they "fixed" TSE weapons), I'd say the initial hate was pretty fucking well deserved.
---
Functional sinks and baths that grant a buff to disease resistance. 
---
Working jacuzzis at are camps that grant a buff after a nice soak. 
---
Fridges and coolers that keep food longer.
---
I'd love to see more camp functionality.
---
Shitting on toilet without working flush, so other people get some presents? Noice
---
Therefore, an additional -25% to sneak
---
I agree with the theory, but I always come back to "it's just a beta, once it goes live, they'll likely make it new characters only"
---
Right :) Always one. But the OP says there's a 70% chance of a second one, which if I've ever seen, it was only once, out of dozens of times of doing the event.
---
I'd say more 15-20k I think you'd be hard pressed to get one cheaper 
---
Yes😂
---
The Bloodied/Swing Speed combo on any melee weapon means goldmine.
---
One shot through slap damage not a thing.. 😂
---
This must be bait mate.
---
Slap damage is capped at 5 Damage, Per Second.
---
I can use my 2000 damage melee attack and guess what, still only hits for 5 damage.
---
People don't ever read things, and don't recognize that if you own a workshop in game, and someone challenges it, it auto-flags you for PVP anywhere on the map. So you could have person A start contesting your shot, and person B sneaks up on you and then bam, insta kill because you're already engaged in PVP.
---
Not a slap damage thing.
---
Like-wise a mini gun with TSE can only hit you for 5 damage every second, and not however fast it actually shoots you.
---
So saying you're acting dense because you out here acting off your emotions and you actually call me names, and I'm the one abusing you? Such fragility lmfaooo
---
There should just be a max full stop. I mean depending on how well you play, you do get it back. I died trying to take down the 2nd place person on my server loosing 300, but along the way I killed 2 guys and gained 700
---
*400 atoms has been deposited into your account for this post*
---
I suppose its new functionality to existing objects,  and I suppose there will be certain atom shop items that will be placable there (i.e. hats, weapons), but I would assume the display cases themselves will not be part of atom shop (and if it will be, it won't be like you can only use this feature if you got atom display case, its more like you can modify the existing display case to be more Mothman looking etc).
---
People with the zero cap damage penalty kill at the same speed? That explains why I was running into people with zero cap rewards...
---
The prices in the atom store have always been pretty steep, and I haven't spent any real money in it. Sorry not sorry. But as you mentioned, Beth starts increasing the value while reducing the price, I'd think long and hard about spending some green if I needed to
---
I should hope so too that you can pay
---
Blame dupers for not making this a thing yet. Bethesda has/had no incentive to make game breaking exploits easier for people to manage.
---
Using the bathroom should consume 1 toilet paper for +5 charisma for 1 hour.  
---
If you have no toilet paper in inventory, -10 charisma for 2 hours
---
You still need to turn off Pacifist in Survival Mode. I made the same mistake as well. It doesn't automatically turn it off for you. 
---
The 560 is a glitch as soon as you exit your power armor your carry weight will reduce by 100 next time you enter it. Just server hop while in your power armor to get the glitched 100 pounds back.
---
I just came in to talk some shit with y'all but I see you got it covered.
---
For the people who actually want a challenge of starting in such a hostile mode and arent gonna be whiny children because its hard
---
Perma death
---
Do you ever take workshops or team up with people who do? Or do you have any "reflect damage" or "hits melee attackers" type of perks or mutations?
---
There are quite a few things that could potentially flag you for PVP, apparently even through passive mode.
---
I've been regularly attacked by people but I have never once taken more than 5 damage in a hit from them. I'm strongly inclined to believe that it's not getting one-shot through slap damage, but rather not realizing you're opted into PVP with the target and thinking it's slap damage.
---
TSE weapons are the cringiest sounding guns in the game. It a douchebag alert - let’s me know when there’s try-hards nearby    
---
Marking player deaths on the map makes a lot of sense to me. The loot in those bags should be contested (they are also impossible to find without map markers). They also serve as a warning to other players to avoid the are. I, for one, like to know where the action is so I can explore elsewhere
---
Then they should refund us back atoms wtf!!!how in the hell do you release a camo pack  that is busted and then you can’t fix it!! Lmao !! It never stops with this game that we love but  it hates us back !! I also got this pack expressively to paint the shotty , The day before I lost a lvl 5 TSE shotty and I still don’t knqow how I did it !!! all I know is I fast traveled from one location to another when I arrived shotgun gone!!! Returned to the spot i left and I see a bag on the floor I was omg thank krom I must of dropped it by accident but when I went to retrieve the contents it just gave the loading prompt for over an hour!!! I figured by painting it it would be more difficult to get rid of, well the  jokes on me twice!!! 
---
An apt discription of the you tube haters is "Recreational Outrage"
---
Also makes everything alive glow.
---
Thank you so much! 
---
Yeah, I will keep posting my impressions and feedback as the mode evolves!
---
Ahh, thanks so much for clarifying!
---
In addition to that, while using them your pipboy will actually be usable.
---
Also while you're sitting on them they should disable any "AFK timer"  
---
So you can go take a crap while you're taking a crap...
---
Yo Dawg...
---
&gt; You can mute try it.
---
I generally do, or I put myself into party chat with only myself in the party so I can't hear anyone else.  My point was more of that it can break the immersion of exploring a dead city when you have someone else show up acting like an obnoxious tourist.
---
&gt; Sorry this game has other people, they warned you it was online only fallout.
---
I know.  You may not have seen the many comments I've made in this subreddit about having to overcome my sheer, utter disdain of MMOs in order to continue my policy/pride of owning a copy of every Fallout game published, but I *have* made such comments.
---
&gt; Life won't cater to you friend but...
---
Someone mentioned not understanding the grievances people have had with F76, so I expressed mine as a means of explanation.  It's not like they're even *big* grievances.  I still play, after all.  I can live without your condescension, thank you. 
---
I'm not talking about dueling and bounty hunting. I'm talking about workshop PVP, where the workshop owner is at a built in disadvantage and defenses are completely useless. 
---
But I don't avoid survival just because of PVP.  I had experience with survival mode in fallout 4. I did a whole play through and beat the game in it for the sake of completion, just to say I experienced all aspects of the game. But it isn't my preferred way of playing the game and isn't something that I consider fun. 
---
When I died first time I dropped 181 stims and 24 supers and game thought it was okay amount to leave me with 22 supers and half of my 100 purified water
---
Don't want to 2nd guess the OP but I am 99% sure that'll be combined. 
---
+10 Atoms: Recycled Water
---
This is one glitch I hope they never fix lol 
---
And you have to have started the sprint from at least 50 feet away.
---
No sprinting from one inch for exploits...^^^like ^^^I ^^^was ^^^thinking ^^^I'd ^^^do.
---
I think your idea of legendary balancing is a far more effective option. 
---
Tons of players have the patience to farm, even if they have the occasional encounter with other players. 
---
Where as some balancing of Legendaries means that you don't have to farm for hours every day just to compete. 
---
I mean, when you have to run an entire pretty specific build just to cope with another specific build, that's an issue. Especially if there's only a very few viable builds to work with. 
---
Agree! If I’m spending money (or time) on Atoms I want to get a good bang and the pack/bundles should be more common. 
---
Some guy was hiding out in whitesprings for 3 hours last night. He was probably stealthed in a corner somewhere, and whitesprings became a slaughter as people looked for them.
---
I know what he's referring to. It wasn't technically slap dmg, it was splash. With high explosive dmg, you could shoot at a wall/floor near someone and do explosive splash dmg. They patched it relatively quickly, but with explosive bobbleheads and splash dmg, it worked for a bit.
---
But you only get that buff if you spend at least 45 minutes on the shitter....
---
And being disconnected resets the timer...
---
^^^muahahahahhahash
---
I’d like to know how likely it is though for a lvl 50 to luck into a legendary weapon as you’ve described?  I’d say not very likely. 
---
It’s the main reason the dupes came to exist.  True (good) legendary drops weeend happening so it opened the door to exploits and dupers.  
---
My only concern with setting a total max is that a player level 300 probably has amazing 3* gear whereas a level 98 might have only some legendary gear. So I think there needs to be at least some benefit to killing a very high level player.
---
What is this Col. Gutsy task force and boss you speak of? Never seen or heard of that
---
Dude I died and my bag fell through the military vehical I was in, and it was completely inaccessible.
---
Bugged the hell out of me since I was on a pretty major junk run.
---
Done!  Thank you. 
---
Ahhh, yeah, that was akin to environmental damage through a technicality. That's a good point, while not actually the slap damage, I can definitely see how that would seem like it, thanks for pointing that out!
---
I can't believe I didn't think of this!
---
Yea they should do that.
---
Yes, that is how sales work. I think my point still stands. It isn't necessarily showing loyalty to a developer to buy things at sticker price. 
---
1. You, or anyone else could have purchased it with atoms acquired through play, and might have given Bethesda $0 by doing so. Giving $0 to Bethesda isn't supporting them. If you are saying that your time spent playing the game is supporting them, do you mean that you don't play the game for fun? I play it to have fun. If Bethesda made crappy games, I wouldn't play those games, and I would have no reason to support them.
---
2. If you were hoping that by paying the original amount for those items to support the developers (as in buying the 7000 atoms with $), then I don't see how you can be annoyed that it went on sale. If your intention was to support them, then if you had waited until the 1500 atom sale, you would have supported them considerably less. You can't have it both ways.
---
3. Sales happen all the time, and if you have played F76 for any substantial amount of time, you would have seen the shop regularly has different things on sale. You should know that at some point, nearly every single item will go on sale.
---
4. If you simply wanted to pay less for those items, then you aren't concerned with loyalty, and merely wanted to get more things by giving away less of your things.
---
What are all 7?
---
Initiate
---
Knight
---
Captain
---
Sergeant
---
Paladin
---
Elder
---
What am I missing?
---
That's survival mode. Your cap count dies too.
---
Good tip :o avoid combat inside 😂
---
More often than not the last guy behind the blocked off corridor a legendary for me. Not every time, but a lot of the time. Got an explosive assault rifle there not too long ago 
---
Since when did trading for duped gear become grinding?
---
I've been grinding for 600+ hours and the best Assassin's piece I have is a level 35 Assassin's with reduced damage while blocking.
---
LadyDevan asked us to file tickets.  I just did. 
---
This is not the first time I've seen this suggested, I think it's a good idea - let everybody assign a vendor bot to hang out outside vault 76. If instead we need sales stalls that would be harder to implement - everyone's going to want the same space. Maybe just have 24 slots (one for each dweller permitted per instance) and have them filled first-come first-serve style.
---
I had this exact problem. The only solution was to relog, and that changed the mission to an endurance test instead of agility. 
---
Iwasn’t there :(
---
I will try this as soon as I can. I would assume so. Get em while they're looking through your bag 😈
---
And then you do all this and get insta killed by some sort of explosive weapon
---
Invulnerability not invisibility. 
---
I get that you may have read it to fast and didn't realise it
---
Officer. It's the one after Sargent
---
Just release private servers so we can make our own rules. I played SM for 20 mins and went right back to DAYZ
---
The rumor started because people didnt know how the system for trading worked, so when someone requested, people would accidentally put the item for free in stead of an amount, or selling more than one. Theres no exploit
---
To me, the idea of survival is great. But the amount of items that have been duped and sold out bought online ruins it. 
---
I had plenty of chances to buy duped armour and guns and never took it for the simple fact, that the game just wouldn’t be a game anymore with god armour and weapons. There would be no more purpose to grind or trade and build, and that’s everything I love about fallout.
---
It especially sucks for all the new players coming into the game, that have to fight against these high level players or anyone that has duped items.
---
But the idea of survival sounds fun and exciting 
---
Would be a good use of a flare gun
---
Thank you!  Got several Knight but zero others last night.
---
It should just be a base amount. 1 caps per level to the max of level 50. So if you die in adventure you lose 50 if you die in survival is 100. Losing more caps because you are higher then level 50 makes no sense. Someone that knows what they are doing will have the same build as the level 200. The level 200 loses more caps why?. You don't get more health or stats from leveling so it makes no sense at all. 
---
One thing that I've found helpful is painting 1 piece of your armor with paints from the Atom Shop - the chassis will be tagged with the atom symbol for items from the shop.
---
This is the closest that I've found to "favoriting" or labeling a chassis and it's not the most convenient thing, but it's been helpful for me!
---
Yup, if this happens I drop a fire or something small on the trunk so it disappears.
---
Nope I dont play Fallout games for PVP . I usually play with 2 or 3 friends and they also arent pvpers .Just dont see enough benefit for the risk.
---
Perfectly balanced
---
Very interesting read, but if you’re in the top three and you’re crouched, are you still marked? 
---
+karma thanks !!can you run me thru the process on how to  file so I can also ?
---
You can't call it survival if you cant just switch and go over to adventure mode whenever you want.
---
Right
---
Thanks this one was really useful! I've been at the whitesprings a number of times because his C.A.M.P is there and he helped me do bunker buster.
---
What level are you though? Level 10 trying to run around at the top of the world, level 25 walking around the Toxic Valley, or 45 in Watoga? I've mainly stuck to areas that should be around my level and I haven't really had this problem (not saying it isn't a real problem though). Level 1-15 I mostly stuck to the forest. 15-27 I went around the Toxic Valley as well (kind of was difficult with my crap skills at lvl 15 in some places), and I'm now exploring the Ash Heap in my early 30s. I'm doing just fine down there and I hardly ever see higher level players except in Welch when they're selling stuff at the station.
---
Appreciate that open sign man! You gotta come write road House bar on the outside for me next time!
---
I don’t think he is, be sneaky. I made 18k caps yesterday, this shit is gonna ruin the market though.
---
As a high level player, I'll sometimes go watch low level folks run through events and quests, just to make sure they're okay and to be able to stimpack them if they die.
---
That's why we have pacifist mode, that would just ruin adventure all together and shovel more coal into the FO76 hate train.
---
See I think the opposite. Most people I know who are kitted out for PvP, already have a LVL 50-60 alt they were using because it's cheaper on caps. That makes it worse. Because these people are kitted out, exactly the same perks as you, same health, ap points, but better gear. And if you kill them you get 100caps, they kill you, they take 300.
---
I bought mine from the Welch train station vendor. Lots of server hops. 
---
They are just labeled Calibrated Shocks under the Mods tab. 
---
You can also buy a plan to craft them from the Camden Park vendor.
---
Not if additive, instead of multiplicative. Which seems to be the case here.
---
&gt;Their time limited items also aren't rare, you get them by participating. 
---
Well, the few people who got the rare masks at  Fasnacht... how did they get them? By participating.  Not through skill or putting in more time. 
---
Yeah it's really weird how it works (or doesn't).  I've had the same experience with level 1 mobs hunting me down (even with chameleon).  Plus, I have Escape Artist (sneak to lose enemies), and I don't think I've ever noticed that working at all - it certainly doesn't work on scorchbeasts even far enough away to be out of gunshot range.
---
The level 100 or whatever level can buy the exact same gear and Will still only lose A third of what the level 300 loses. Make it a base amount you lose instead of a sum based on level. 
---
I actually think it would be interesting game strategy to start a new character and enter Survival - basically lvl 10 or lower.  You shouldn’t be an appealing target (no caps) and the hunters will be focused on much higher level players (more caps).  I mean, that’s the idea right?  My current lvl 150 player and build would probably compete OK but I know I’d be much more of a target because each death costs me 300 caps.  
---
Carnivore doesnt benefit cannibal. So no increased hunger satisfaction and you can still get diseases using cannibal. And you can still eat cooked veggie stuff for the buff and hydration but no hunger will be satisfied. 
---
I’ve been playing since beta, and I’ve never seen a single piece of sentinels OR assassins gear drop. 
---
Not once. 
---
I don’t have the time to grind for drops or resources to trade, and I’m not about to pay actual money just so I can have a chance against people who do.  
---
It may not be Bethesda running the marketplace, but it’s still pay to win.  
---
__As all things should be.__
---
The dreaded dookie debuff. 
---
Pedantic mode on:
---
If you form a team at the main menu, only the leader gets that big-ass warning screen.  The non-leader members just get dragged in without warning.
---
But you should probably not be forming a team with a leader who you don't trust.
---
Yes but paints are expensive :(
---
Just treat it like an episode of Sliders.
---
What would keep someone from taking a workshop and just sitting on it forever?
---
Yea I’m not seeing mine either. 
---
Wonder if they know? 
---
/u/Ladydevann 
---
&gt; And then we have WoW, which has basically everything "free" since you pay for it with your subscription and the few things you can buy are never the least necessary and more the "super premium" things that no one really needs because the base variety is already enormous. 
---
[https://us.shop.battle.net/en-gb/product/world-of-warcraft-warforged-nightmare](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-gb/product/world-of-warcraft-warforged-nightmare) \- Does this look something that I am getting with my subscription in WoW? No it aint. Well Fallout 76 has everything free too, you paid 60 dollars for get the game. You didn't pay 60 dollars for game and cosmetics addons.
---
I can't talk for SC2 or D3, but in HotS you didn't get premium currency that easy either. Yes you got the skins and other stuff from lootboxes, but also that game hat sh#t tons of more cosmetics.
---
If you look even wider, what game actually gives you premium currency that easy? Every live game service either rewards you for being active or only for money- League of Legends: S rank game only earns chest, none of those include premium, Apex/Fortnite: You have to first spend money and then be active to earn premium currency that is limited, CS: Random loot boxes, most with 0,03-0.10$ skin value, PUBG: pretty much same as CS, Both R6 and FH require lot of time to unlock new character. Anthem? Probably not. 
---
We are in the same discord, I could have told you to stay off of reddit lol
---
I put my base between two low cap travel train stations, so when I hit top 3 I just ninja'd out of there with fast travel to cheese the system. 
---
dude, I know how to play games, my fucking point is I shouldn't have to use exploits to avoid poor design.
---
My wife and I created new characters to play survival.  It can be done, you just have to treat it like a survival situation instead of a typical MMORPG.  Shocking.
---
Will do no problem help me kill a few folks we will call it even 😂 
---
Laughs in strength 25
---
Since when is spawning somewhere else an exploit??
---
I mean like, I honestly don't care for the ppl on this site. I just wanted to see if anyone had an idea lmfao
---
Haha yeah made that mistake before, hard to tell in some areas.
---
You speak the untold truth, this game would be perfect with normal weapon and normal armor,where even with vats you don't do crazy amount of damage with critical
---
I agree completely. This would give Bethesda a more consistent stream of data too. Without the variables of legendary effects, they could see what base weapons need work and which ones are good as is.
---
I think everyone should make new characters and have no legendary effects in survival... on the other hand I do really like the fact you can earn legendary weapons via weekly challenges, so that’s conflicting. Maybe when May rolls around and the purveyor is active I won’t care about the challenge anymore 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Just my opinion really, I do have some OP weapons, but I generally leave them stashed because I like a firefight, not a instakill fest. Likewise being one shorted by a bloodied build isn’t fun, especially when you loose a ton of aid items and caps.
---
It wouldn’t remain a level playing field for long, given the difference in available playing hours, so I understand not even trying to pretend to make it so. 
---
Yeah , exactly and it's just periclitating the 1000 caps youmput as bounty.
---
If you feel so strongly about it, run up a mountain and have a little "accident" and voila - no more pesky timer. Bank your aid and junk first. Problem solved.
---
I personally like bein in the top three, it's not the usual counter camping dreary affair.
---
having our camps protected from damage is in an upcoming update iirc..
---
.. honestly, I don't mind the limited PvP we have in Adventure, centered around work shops, with set easy rules that everyone understands. It's easily avoided if you so wish, and if you feel like pushing the edge a little, claiming a workshop is a nice not too risky way to do it.
---
yeah. Pacifist mode doesn't keep you from taking damage, only penalizes you for trying to be a good citizen.
---
Thank you for the reply, it’s good to hear that you can still benefit from the buffs

Im sorry for my rude phrasing but come on dude, its just whining at this point. LvL 46 isnt exactly low level either. You should have expected something like this to happen if you just stumble in the servers on day one. Just view the game mode as it is , a Deathmatch. anyone leveling or doing queen and stuff on survival servers must be a masochist. Just play smart, get to lvl 50, get some decent gear and switch servers for a little deathmatch.
---
The 560 is the glitch.  If you log out while in your excavator, the next time you log in the bonus 100 is doubled.  This remains until you get out of and back into the armor.  And the only way to get the glitched bonus back is to log out while in the PA again.  
---
The nearest station is whitesprings and that's a decent run, plus as he said they had chameleon pieces so it would've been hard to spot coming in blind/open
---
I think they'd have a huge problem with the perk cards.  Those create such large effects that you can't really "normalize" a level 10 and a level 100.  For example, that 100 probably has max fireproof, and that 10 has none.
---
Haha my Bloodied sniper’s prized possessions aren’t her guns, they’re her pair of  3* Unyielding Acrobat legs!  I’d have a full Marine set if the left was was marine, too... light combat armor :-/
---
Escape Artist is by far my least reliable perk, seems very randomly applied.
---
You can opt-in. There's no need to remove it. They are changing dmg to bases soon, so there won't be griefing, or harrassment into in PvP. So it really won't bother those who don't want to participate, but occasionally friends will want to have a boxing match, test out new guns against each, have a friendly contest with someone. It has a purpose for some people.
---
I don't see how bringing my brother in and ruining the later seasons of the game is gonna help. 
---
When I played it the very first time, I found some power armour in a carriage in Morgantown trainyard, but I couldn't get into it as I was only level 6. 
---
I don't understand all this "I got killed one second after spawning" stuff. What happened to the period of invulnerability after spawning? Is it too short? Or do people not realize that if they fire their weapon they lose the temporary invulnerability buff?
---
Yeah I'm not touching survival mode with a ten foot pole, I'll leave that to people who enjoy that sort of thing.
---
Eating anything spoiled removes it.
---
This is an excellent write up, and I agree with most of it. A lot of people really shot themselves in the foot deciding just to go in with a fresh character. It was literally day one of a new PvP mode that dedicated PvPers have been waiting for, I don't know what they expected. It's called survival mode because the idea is not to die for as long as possible, hence the leader board. A lot of people really wanted this to be a hardcore PvE mode with the murder penelty turned off, but that's just not the scope or intent of this. There's another game mode listed on the roadmap, which I would imagine will be more geared towards hardcore PvE.
---
For me at least, I've found that the melee challenge works every time IF I kill an enemy with an unarmed attack, vs weapon bash.
---
For some of the others, like "score a critical hit" I often have to server hop, and then it'll register properly. 
---
I disagree .. But I see your Point. I still Disagree. Character should be new and Static to that server type IMO. For many reasons that have been listed below. 
---
Dear sir, the majority of feedback given few days after updates on this subreddit are always the same complains or irrealistic suggestions. Many of you dont think about the majority of players. They speak for their wishes. And sorry this is annoying because of the many post of the same population. Not a majority of players.  That is pollution for this subreddit. I wonder why the moderators dont centralise these topics. 
---
A previous user answered with this (bolding is mine):

Is this what you tried?
---
Hahahaha, I didn't even notice! Thanks - I'll save you a slice ;D
---
Oh I see, OP did say this was 10 attempts only, RNG can be pretty misleading with a relatively small sample, I did 20 runs on Westek and got 100% legendaries and posted it was a goldmine, but after doing it 100's of times I would say it was closer 50-60%. (admittedly I'm not recording the numbers anymore).
---
 The other thing is we have no idea if anything else has a factor in this, if multiple people are doing the event there is typically an increase in Spawns and, presumably, a corresponding increase in chance of random additional Legendary.
---
They should have just made a death match system. Like team 1 defends fort or camp and team 2 attacks at the end of it they get rewards  and then survival should have been all areas now have level 100 plus enemy's that give more exp and better rewards. 
---
Only thing I would say is, they need to change the rules on workshop PvP to be confined only within that workshop PvP area.
---
Just don’t watch the Angry Joe Show and you’ll be fine.
---
Awesome thank you for the information.
---
people like you ruin games as a whole. Nice try though.
---
I see, so you can take advantage of the mobs that appear without participating in the real objective, therefore not having to worry about PvP. Thanks for the info.
---
Halleluya 
---
Then that’s quite interesting. Assassin would work, I suppose.
---
Obviously, it won’t beat out a sentinel or cavalier set in most cases.
---
And tbh, staggering the enemy is hard if they can cut you down in half a second.
---
Load times are sometimes too long on console that the invulnerability isn't long enough 
---
I think I can manage that lmao
---
Evasive and serendipity are the good ones. Barbarian and ironclad are a waste. DR doesn't even really matter here
---
Like it, but mostly because I have a dark sense of humour. Considering the shitstorm caused by folks not reading or taking seriously the warnings about dropping aid on death could you imagine it lol.
---
Yea, armor is worthless. Effects are the game now.
---
oh, you mean fast traveling somewhere in adventure mode and then joining survival, how is that not an exploit?  and even if you are just saying to avoid Whitesprings Station, my answer is I SHOULDN'T FUCKING HAVE TO!
---
Works quite well for Enclave ops. Adds an extra layer of realism and makes tactics more viable. 
---
If I can't keep doing the same thing over and over expecting different results how am I supposed to blame everything but myself??
---
I'm death Match Rickkkkkkkkkkk Biatch ... 
---
I have a 2500k oc'd @ 4.5GHz
---
I can play the game on low with shadows turned all the way down. It plays, but it's a little spotty at times.
---
I think the legendary spawns also changed in one or more patches. There seems to be a cooldown effect now at places that, months ago, would spawn \*\* or \*\*\* every day.
---
you can run it, i can barely run it on an i3 core but it still works.
---
I agree that it's a different kind of game , but maybe the PvP is not my style. It was  my first PvP encounter so maybe I was frustrated as well. I love the game but the level difference is unbalanced . That's my opinion .
---
No offence taken . 
---
Yes, I would agree. "Stealth Always Works Until It Doesn't" would be my assessment :)
---
Just like the other person said. It’s survival it’s supposed to be an extreme challenge not some walk in the park where you hoard caps. 
---
I'm on the 'drink fresh beer' one, or whatever it's called.  Made a fermentable beer and drank it, no update.  Made more and drank them, no update.  Spent 60 caps on vendor beers (too lazy to farm them), drank all 5, no updates.
---
It's been like that since before the parade started, and I've still got it on my quest list.
---
Because once all of the casual players realize that survival mode is geared towards players who traded for duped armor sets and quit trying to play survival mode......all of the griefers will get bored fighting against other dupers in survival mode and will want to come back to adventure mode so they can pick on people who didn't trade for duped sets of armor 
---
My 3.0 ghz i5 runs it fine. You will be good
---
Any serums left?
---
I don’t know what it is but I get this as well. “Kill” a player with my sniper to see his health instantly regain and effectively take no damage.
---
No not swapping game modes leaving a survival server and join another. Or ya know just going to your camp or another fast travel station it's not rocket science.
---
Gamma guns are known to ignore assassin sentinel. However, they’re slow and dodge-able.
---
I'm sick of people pretending level 200s are somehow better than 50s. who gives a shit. 
---
Yeah, but the thing that you use to place your camp above ground can get in the way of placing things, so your still can't use all of the build area.
---
This whole problem would be solved if it required new characters only, who would be bound to survival forever with no option to go back and forth to adventure mode.
---
People with all the OP gear in adventure mode wouldn’t be able to  transfer it to new survival characters or sell it to other survival players. 
---
All trades would have to happen on survival. Thus making trading a risky endeavor even if you find PvP gear and want to sell it. 
---
The one shot/assassin/sentinel meta would effectively be dead in survival mode if they did this. Everyone would start equal with no ability to mule over OP gear
---
"Playing survival BETA since it released"
---
What, yesterday. 
---
Not planning to take my main character but considering a new character for PVP. Curious to know some of the basics of Survival Mode. I.E. do you have any locations you learned in Adventure Mode on your map? If a placed a camp in adventure, is it in the same place for Survival? Just looking to learn more about what my first step into survival will involve, beyond being 1-shot 100 times by assn/sent builds.

\[We can sell 80% of the screen without inducing seizures.\]( [/r/readyplayerone/comments/a0zn9l/we\_can\_sell\_80\_percent\_of\_the\_screen\_without/](https://www.reddit.com/r/readyplayerone/comments/a0zn9l/we_can_sell_80_percent_of_the_screen_without/) )
---
Survival would be 100x better without legendaries. They’re simply too powerful.
---
its fucking boring and a waste of time? 
---
I've been saying it... These YouTube Fanboys get behind their favorite reviewer/steamer who says it's crap, and regurgitate what they see. When those streamers and YouTubers are just trying to stay relevant for views, because views = money for them.
---
So if the hype is to hate on a game, they all will hate on it.
---
They want money... Social media trends are destroying the gaming industry.
---
True, it can.
---
Bummer, I'm on PC otherwise I'd just install it for you for free+parts.
---
I’m not going to comment on how those or anyone enjoys playing any game 
---
My point was a lot drama and Ill will forced many folks to stop playing Fallout 76 
---
As for their friend stats it’s not that important for me to impose on my friends to do something they don’t like.
---
See how that works? Friendship works both ways lolz
---
Or in fact the opposite, like the spawn points and player markers they will serve as a camping spot for griefers. I can’t speak for everyone but as someone who’s got 1000s of hours in PvP survival games I’ve never seen it done before and this is probably the reason why. Again, interactions would play out better without any artificial systems put in to try and manipulate player interaction. If you hear gun fire then there’s your warning to tread lightly it you want to avoid engagements.
---
Thanks for the advice but I tried so many variations of melee attacks I've just given up. I tried unarmed right away, then tried it in power armor, with board, with a axe, with a knife, every random underlevel melee item I got from the enemies I killed with melee weapons. 
---
It just should be this difficult....
---
Idc that the amount or recipes I can get in a day are limited, but jumping through hoop after hoop just to get a recipe is too much. 
---
I truly want this game to be amazing! I LOVE the Fallout series, but man is it getting tiresome
---
We must be shooting a diff gamma gun.
---
It fired a lightning bolt. I grounded, thus don't run energy weapons.
---
Yeah, it is great if you are, say, level 50 or around there, great mode to play in, with the opportunity to net some big caps
---
I just hit level 151 last night and I have no desire to slow down. I keep finding things to do, places to explore, weapons to buy, etc..
---
Theres always a handful roaming the outskirts of whitesprings 
---
You on ps4? If so i’m happy to join up and have you as team leader so i can see the quests you have and try to help. Will be 5 hours til i can hop on unfortunately.
---
Heavy weapon bundle please? All the gatlings, minigun and 50 cal... 
---
No, my suspicion is that it takes half the time, I did face those people.
---
You gotta remember how fast paced the spawn trap business is though. 
---
You won’t be at 0 for long.
---
Exactly. I want to play Fallout, not Fortnite
---
probably some jerk who uses "cancer" to talk about video games 
---
I always find this cheesing mechanics posts very entertaining. Please keep at it.
---
And yet you still play....lolz
---
I've been playing this game since the beta and have yet to find someone who's made a shop - will def check it out! Happy Gaming to ya :)
---
The same odds ANYONE lucks into a good legendary weapon? How the fuck do you think those dupers got their weapons to dupe in the first place?  When I was like level 52 I lucked into an explosive shotgun that carried me to well over level 100 when they started nerfing the effect.  No one NEEDS to luck into a god rolled three star weapon in the first place, even just getting a single star Bloodied effect can put you a rung over everyone else.
---
Energy Weapons don't have Explosive effects anymore. 
---
who gives a shit 
---
Hey Bro happy birthday! Hope it's a good one!
---
That's because in other games the "legendaries" are individually designed.  That lets the game designers consider the effect on the meta, and tweak the stats on the item.
---
In FO76, legendaries are a randomly-chosen modifier applied to a weapon.  That makes it way easier on the game developers, but gives them have far less fine control of the items.
---
Yeh I honestly feel for the high level players but the caps help. 
---
Is... is that nick real?
---
I don't dislike the ability to see some players on the map - but I do think a slightly better version of the top three system might be if it's survival time recorded from their first PVP kill on that life. That way low level players aren't being targeted for just farting around in the wilderness. 
---
Every level past 50 buys a new perk card or moves a special point.
---
Would actualy start playing again for a proper survival mode.
---
Ideally, like you mentioned, no map markers or pvp restrictions &amp; survival only characters.
---
+ Independant stashes, then we could raid each other and actually have a reason to build a camp with defences.
---
Would you please sell me yours for 500 caps?  ;)
---
Never say never I guess but I would only engage in that mode to get a challenge reward weapon if there was one I really liked the look of. I wouldn’t go looking for others and I’d try to stay off the radar as much as possible  just concentrating on the weapon challenge at hand. I have neither the desire to PvP or the weapons, build  or armour for it so the only option would be sneak in do the challenge and then sneak out making sure all aid and junk was stashed and all caps spent on plans etc just before hand just in case.
---
How do you know it was a TSE? You can easily tell if it was explosive but two-shot is hard to spot with a shotgun. Could have been bloodied explosive, anti armor explosive, etc. which may be better for survival mode. 
---
It would be better if the build area was cylinder shaped instead of a sphere with a set height limit equal to the height of the sphere.
---
Remove the camp system, the need to eat and drink, aid drops, and just let people go at it. it would be a decent mode. not a mode you'd play for long but a mode that is high stakes high risk. the use would be legendaries and caps.
---
You can make a lot of caps if youre doing well though. Its fun
---
Bethesda should rename survival mode to Fortnite mode, because that's the type of people who want that crap
---
Seems many of the placement changes in Patch 7 have been undone by this Survival patch.  Including the expanded CAMP items that would "bulldoze" grass and weeds.  Back to having Grass and Weeds stick up thru foundations and drowning out your crops.
---
Nope, on PC, and my play time is...erratic at best.  Long hours and little time to play between home responsibilities means I hop on for a few when I can...the curse of middle management :P
---
I've been trying to figure out something I witnessed back around.... ~~well actually lets get the screenshot's timestamp~~... hmpf I don't know where it went now :( 
---
ANYways... It would've had to been sometime within the first three weeks of December. I was doing the Momma Dulce's event when a higher level ~~(75 I think)~~ came in to help and was wearing the coolest configuration. Was like ratty clothing, the raider burlap-sack hose mask, and then a Left T-60 leg and a Right T-60 arm... **but no PA chassis**... I had hoped it was some cool end-game perk that would let you wear PA armor w/o a chassis, but since that was the only time I've witnessed that, which I myself now have a lvl 75 and lvl 83 and have not seen any sort of Perk pertaining to something of that nature. It looked awesome though and I think Bethesda should add something like that. Would fit well as a Strength perk. Balancing it would be the real trick though. I'd imagine something like 2x AP Consumption, 1/2 Movement Speed *(I know there's a Mutation that has a negative effect to prevent sprinting, so that could be a consideration).* It'd be a flatrate-debuff, regardless of how many pieces you wore, even if just the helmet. But I digress....
---
I presume that the "Slenderman PA" bug you're referring to is the one where you appear naked and stretched out like a Wendigo to other people? lol This was [a pic my friend took of me](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZyw3MDAsNzYwLOxKZqMAmWN35kc2MY1nSh6Fqbwq1pF20Yf2YSssemlb) when that happened.
---
Oh awesome! That’s actually a nice system.
---
They're only levels 25, 35 &amp; 45 no? 
---
I learned this the hard way...
---
Guide to be a good complainer in pvp. Carry lot of aids and junk. Dont have friend to mule your caps. Spawn and respawn over and over on whitespring train station. Always think that a player that kills you twice is a TSE duper griefer. You are now reddit (oups ready) to create a topic. 
---
They still exist from before the patch 
---
My sentiments exactly
---
If you do it right you won't be. That's the point of doing it. 
---
Hahahaha Damnit. THANK you for the reply .. so Now I know .. and Can say to myself .. HA I killed them guys .. I did, I did. Just not technically HAHAHAH.. upvote for you sir  
---
Thanks for doing your job!
---
But when everyone is leveled and has that gear again, the new players are stuck fighting them with no other option.  New characters could be killed instantly at vault 76 and completely unable to counter them.
---
James Gunn?
---
Then the level 10's camp Vault 76.  The level 20's camp two train stations.  The level 30's camp two other train stations.  etc.
---
This isn't a game mechanics problem.  It's a player problem.  Both the wannabes that camp and the players who don't want to think about how to counter them.
---
Whats the zero cap damage penalty?
---
Contact PSN player apexigod and he can help you get LOTS of caps, VERY fast. 
---
The story behind it is about 5-6 years ago I was making my first and only account. I left the naming up to my cousin which was 12 at the time. He saved my name before I could look it over
---
I don’t agree. My experience has been finding the people before they find me and then getting insta killed. I sneak and am very cautious. I get the first shots and they just don’t take damage.
---
That's my feeling as well, when I farm I'll try and stick to a server where there are several legendaries spawned across the OP's locations, and loop around them, they'll respawn (at a random \* level) after about 25-30 minutes. But this has become rarer in my experience and only occasionally do I stumble on a well stocked server.
---
Find one of these servers and couple of hours you  can be swimming in 1\* Wood Left Legs  :)
---
OMFG yes on number 5. Take all the upvotes.
---
I’d like to be able to scrap them for materials (eg. standard card is scrapped for 10 card scarp and an animated one is scrapped for 30 card scrap) 
---
And then with the scrap you can craft a new card for 50 scrap (100 for animated) or buy a level up for 100 scrap!
---
Ya, it's not _horrible_ but if you need to do a serious respec it can take a lot of time to do so.
---
It sounds like there’s some history here that I missed out on. 
---
Really? Thought they would have removed them too. Good luck.
---
I'm not sure how not asking your friends for help somehow ties into friendship being a 2 way street?
---
Same here! I do like this new mode because it is like a new experience for me and I like the challenge...but it kinda gets annoying when I am constantly one-shotted by a 150+ dude (I made a new character for this to be fair). I don't shoot anyone I come across, I wave to let people know I am friendly. I only attack if I am attacked first.
---
No I've found a lv 50 lever action 
---
There should be fixed amount of caps like at this moment extra 20% exp it's punishment not reward. My PvP character is lvl 35 and i can kill lvl 350 as easily as he can kill me but if i win i earn 700 caps if he win i lose 70 caps because logic.
---
Another problem are people running in survival totally broke you take the risk fighting them, you waste bullets and there is totally zero reward for that. Quick fix for now will be marking them on map the same as wanted players and giving them penalty to awareness (no compass dot showing another players and empty map no vision of other wanted players or top 3 players)
---
Now tell me where is the flow in my logic 😅
---
I agree with the spawn kills needed to be fixed. That shouldn’t be a thing but I heard melee sucks in survival. It’s the guys with tses and explicit guns one shorting everyone. I personally haven’t played just cuz the spawn deaths. That’s not a fun way to play if u can’t even get a chance to load in. 
---
&gt;Eventually those players who actively hunt down other players will have to farm junk for themselves to support the habit (repair/ammo).
---
Or they just use the junk they pick up from their victims.
---
&gt;Allowing crossover between the two modes is by far one of the worst design decisions I've seen go live in this game.
---
Or Bethesda actually wanted to test the game mode during the beta, and to do that you need the largest possible selection of players, covering the largest possible variety of levels and gear.
---
But muh Angry Joe said....
---
Gotcha, well just check and see if it asks you to do something else after drinking the beer.  It usually has me do a task while intoxicated but doesn’t show me what until after i have consumed the drink it says to. Hopefully you can complete it, there are some useful drinks that can be crafted thru those quests!
---
Yes i tried  this but still not working 
---
I wish perfect storm worked, but it does not. 😕
---
Maybe beta wave lasers? (Adds burn damage)
---
Maybe flaming pitch fork?
---
Flaming Chainsaw??!
---
So after level 50 when you level up you have the choice to level up a perk card or move a point from one skill group to another. For example you can move one point from luck to strength. You do not gain anymore points, you must either level up, let’s say your sneak card, or move a point. You still get card packs at every 5th level. It’s not hard to respec but can take a while to complete the process if you wasted points in the beginning like I did. 
---
I love the PA wasteland camo! Totally rocks.
---
"Took a load off" 
---
Increased Movement Speed and + 15 to carry weight.
---
"Death Aura Debuff" anything with a nose dies if you come close 
---
I started a new character for survival and I'm having a lot more fun with it, since I have very little to lose, but yeah it's kind of a kicker farting about in the wilderness then having a target painted on your back for surviving for so long. My idea is that instead of it being longest survival time for the top three players it should be longest survival time since your first PVP kill on that life. PVP players get much the same experience but low level players don't get punished as much. 
---
Any rodents should drop them.  Not just squirrels.
---
Opossums are everywhere.
---
I didn't know. No name calling. Unnecessary
---
Glad to help! And another tip - if you become Wanted in Survival and switch back to Adventure mode, you will still remain wanted. 
---
It’s so lame that you cant
---
1.  The game should let you bank caps (at a camp safe?) and carry caps, so you can only lose caps in PvP if you're carrying them to buy/sell.  If your Camp gets attacked and the safe is found and opened, they will then get a specified larger amount of caps (not all, 200 or some specified amount based on stats)
---
2.  If players know plans when you kill them, the killing player should have an intelligence or luck roll to possibly learn a Plan from a downed player.  The killed player doesn't forget the plan.
---
3.  All survival characters must start new and are locked in Survival.  The plan to not do this was broken from the beginning
---
4.  I'm not bothering with this current Arcade survival mode, it's so poorly done.
---
Despite having no mods other than the prime receiver, it is still a really good weapon with a high DPS. Heck, I think it has the highest DPS of all heavy weapons. The drawback is it's small clip size relative to other heavy weapons.
---
That seems to have stopped now :(
---
Might be players farming the area for Ultractie (fixing PA) for survival mode. Sometimes when I farm Morgan High School for plastic there is nothing there for at least 2/3 server hops or a day or two. It just happens and you have to keep plodding on till you 'hit gold' so to speak.
---
yea thats a feature now
---
We can’t be the only ones.  I counted last night and I’m easily missing 25+ mods and known plans that I unlocked long ago. 
---
Ran it on an i7-870 (first generation) with a gtx980.
---
Would you be able to test this out on someone with full ass/cav? I have a full set and after about 6 hours of playing yesterday it seemed like the effect wasnt working at all. Im wondering if it's something on my toon or if thos is the case for everyone with that set? Are you on ps4? Because if so i woul love to meet in hame and help you test it.
---
Oh really?  Hmm...
---
Guess we gotta wait til next year to enjoy the sausage.
---
Awesome, thanks! I haven’t ever seen another shop either, other than the first and second ones I’ve built. No pics of the first one but here’s my second shop, [The Mad Hog](https://youtu.be/-R8RE1_b0Mg). I loved the outside appearance of it way more than Helvetia Market, but the inside was generic. My next spot will be a mix of the two I think 
---
Explosive you can tell, but how can you see the two bullets? How can you tell it's not a nocturnal explosive or an instigating explosive or a ghoul slayer explosive.   All those duped TSE weapons are garbage now.  The new meta is bloodied if anything and they weren't popular during the duping because TSE Used to be 30000% more powerful than it is today.   
---
I really feel like there's no point in taking my main character, a level 315 there. I lost everything I earned from 4 kills in one death.
---
Once you get level 50, I would start doing nukes into Whitesprings; you'll get the most "bang for your buck" as far as XP goes and items. I'm beyond level 100, and I farm XP by going to fissure sites and killing Scorchbeasts again and again (it's like 450xp per kill plus all the scorched). Up until 50, I'm not sure; workshops seem potentially dangerous, as PvP can be instigated with them. I would find a higher level place, like south of the Forest, and use some melee so you don't go through as much ammo and just farm farm farm the scorched.
---
I'll definitely send a PSN friend request (referencing Reddit) and check out your goods one night soon.  I am usually on in the evenings. I am always on the lookout for random plans that I don't yet know.
---
Dont play survival then bum
---
Good to know. So if I bring the mats... just the tip, then?
---
Happy to see that there is also good suggestions topics in this ocean of complains
---
Level 45 is max Lever Action.  I think Hunting Rifle is 50.
---
No problem.
---
Combined, especially RobCo, because a found a legendary ghoul or super mutant outside once or twice. West Tek I haven’t found a legendary outside, but it’s only logical that they could spawn there.
---
I just started playing last week. When I saw survival I thought they were going to make a level playing field. The fact that any level can join makes this unplayable for someone like me. Survival mode needs to require you make a new character. It’s the only way that makes sense. 
---
Also a team death match would be awesome. But they should definitely make smaller maps that you load into maybe use the work shops and put walls around them. They can call the game mode “the pit” or something. And match you against people your own level. As well as make it 5v5  or 8v8. 
---
Also I paid 20 bucks for this game. I definitely think Bethesda will get more people to purchase is they relaunch at 29.99. I believe that’s a fair price for this game.
---
Yes it’s possible as I’ve had the T60 initiate paint 3 times from turning in tech data even though I read the plan, last night I finally got a different T60 one
---
My lvl 35 PvP character have god tier gear because i moved it from my main character. Plus there is dmg normalisation for lower lvl and i can kill lvl 350 as easily as any high lvl player.
---
Every opposum I come across has had some
---
Same here, on PS4
---
Sounds like the games working as intended to me
---
Props to you for observation. Assassin Sentinel is stupid OP. In those cases it's best not to fight them if you see them first. Until it eventually gets nerfed that is.   
---
"The best fight is the one that never happens"
---
Hasn't updated yet to show me anything, just continues to tell me to drink fresh beer.
---
I'm assuming that I just haven't drank *enough* beer, 5 didn't do it, but I never pushed it past that (I farmed the parade *hard core* hoping to get rare masks, plus 60 caps per was pretty nice!).  Once I have enough time to adjust my camp and farm up some mats, I'll give my liver a solid kick and see how many beers it takes to induce...something.  It won't be pretty, but it will be interesting ;-)
---
Thanks for the help and encouragement, it's appreciated.
---
I punched a Stealth boy sniper to death yesterday.  Not stealth enough lol.  Was fun though. He dropped soooooo many stimpaks 
---
Thaaaaanks muchly ;D
---
The shelters wont save from a main nuke blast, they just save you from mini nuke explosions and missile blasts from other players. Countless tests have been done all with the same results. A puddle of goo and your bag of junk are all that survived many tests by many different groups of people.   
---
Also Power Armor only helps with the radiation, the blast will still kill you essentially instantly if inside the blast radius as it lands.
---
Dont play it then. Pretty simple
---
Yeah but that won't last for long, people losing caps won't return and you will end up with just people exploiting the game mechanics.
---
Yup. Too bad their entitled. This game isn’t just theirs. 
---
Well my main weapons a tse gatling plasma lol. Good luck to you to
---
Agreed. At the very least they need require new characters for Survival mode.
---
Have a weeklong event like Fasnacht where some responder robot wants to open the vault. It was programmed with a contingency in case of emergency to bring the vault back up. But to do so permanently the bot needs some resource deep inside the vault. You find some way to get in for a limited time and collect as much as you can and get out. Once the week is over the resources we’ve been collecting are enough to permanently power the vault. 
---
Probably going to go this route now. Hard to tell is someone is gonna be unkillable before the first shot.
---
Unlucky you got killed, but lucky you didn’t lose the robots. When I kill them they immediately explode and disappear into orbit.
---
Nah, it was a lot of fun playing with a brand new character last night.  It requires playing the game very differently than adventure mode.  That choice should be available for everyone.
---
If you don't think players &lt;50 should play it....then stay in adventure until you're 50.  It's not like you're being forced to play survival with a new character.  Even the survival-only challenges are just standard legendaries with special names.
---
I would honestly consider muling caps an exploit. Not everyone has the money to spend on a second system to mule and not everyone has internet friends to help them undermine the system
---
I seem to have been indoctrinated to pursue and murder all small creatures after last week, as such, I have found that many do still contain intestines. 
---
no pvp at all on adventure. let the pvp scum over on survival.
---
Yeah. That makes sense. Im cool with the aid drop. I just hit the stash a lot but yeah the caps may be excessive 
---
Was never a thing.
---
Only price one item for sale at a time though.
---
Okay can I help you out here? Don't get mad at me for trying okay? So if you run the fireproof perk or you modify armor to have the "dense" mod you'll take way less explosive damage.  Run both and you'll hardly take any.  If you're on PC I can mod your raider torso to have dense. Lemme know and I'll give you my discord if interested.
---
I finally got one yesterday! 
---
There are 7 total.
---
Knight, Knight SGT, Knight CPT
---
Officer, Palidan
---
They were introduced with Wild Appalachia and are rare-ish. They take a serious grind to get
---
I played for 15 whole minutes today before I hit #3 on the scoreboard and before I know it I've got 3 dudes ganging up on me just outside Watoga. The only thing that made me happy is that I got two of them before the third nailed me with a missile launcher. Oh and least I got to keep one whole stimpack this time.
---
Oooh okay, i guess ive been beatung the wrong possums to death thanks! 
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind the griefers if I wouldn't lose stuff and respawn was way faster. Like cod fast. 
---
Oh well I actually kind of do, doesn’t matter to me though I guess, got nothing but timmmeeeee
---
What lvl? 😂 
---
The reason we need to have survival mode only characters is not because of gear. It's because currently, people will only join these servers to have a deathmatch, and that gets old very, very quick. Then they will go back to Adventure to do all their "real" playing. If that's what Bethesda was going for, we could have just made a battle royale mode. 
---
What I want - what most of the people want it seems on these forums judging by the upvotes on threads like this, is to make survival mode meaningful. No running back to adventure mode to restock. No, if you want to restock, find better gear, etc., you do it in survival mode. I'd love the idea of seasons too, like Diablo 3 / Path of Exile, but that could be another mode altogether.
---
You remove the pieces the frame is can be worn any level
---
Once in awhile my friends and I want to goof around and go off pacifist in adventure mode and beat each other up with rolling pins or protest signs for giggles. I like that they are taking away slap damage and damage to camps. 
---
I experienced it from launch and it wasn’t nearly as bad as everyone was complaining. Sure they needed to fix some things but the whining was really too much and a lot of it lacked substance. 
---
You considere that is but its not for Bethesda. So there is no problem
---
To be honest, I don't remember the details now. I wasn't upset about it since they didn't grief me or anything. Just killed me once and didn't even take my junk. I didn't take a camp that day and I don't believe I was flagged for PvP. This happened probably two months ago.
---
Tsdm=trainstation deathmach 
---
"Kids Dropped Off At the Pool" (+20% swimming speed)
---
This is true ;-;
---
Walk
---
Definitely wasted a lot of points in the beginning man, I’ve been kicking myself for it ever since but I guess I just got to deal with it bro, going to be so fulfilling when I finally respec to the build I want though, want to get there before the new main quest line comes in.
---
I disagree... back to ESO for example. 
---
At level 5, I may not have any dmg reduction whatsoever, while the 300+ I am with, could have crazy elemental dmg reduction.
---
That comes with being higher level. However, As a low level, I can still do my part in a fight in that game. My base attacks are similar to theirs, for example.
---
In Fallout... with my pipe pistol at level 5, if a group of level 200 dudes decide to show up and take part in the event at Flatwoods... I'm screwed.
---
I have a 2-shot 140+ damage shotty (that I just lost somehow).  If I wasn't standing practically in the pocket of a level 1 scorched in the parade event, there was a good chance that it wouldn't die.  Shotty's are very short range weapons unless you mod them to work better (if even then, mine was not really modded much, it existed just to use up the 3000 shells I had accumulated).
---
Excavator set 45. Me 83. Xbox one
---
Exactly, the leaderboards thing increases PvP on a huge map with only 24 or less people.  This mode is for people that want PvP.  I love it despite getting one shotted by tse on occasion.  I'm just about to hit level 10 on my survival toon.
---
Should have been an AFK spot.
---
Only to your camp and stations
---
I built there for a while. handy tip- the oil street lamps look great and light the place very well.
---
Sweet! I lived down there for a bit but I moved back to the Mire later, opted to build higher up instead of underground.
---
Yeah, but that's not deleted, it's just stored until next time
---
That sounds a lot like Elite Dangerous to me lmao. Yeah that's def a Lore workaround
---
I’m PS4 and thanks for the tips, I’ll give it a shot.
---
So, he made you a bunch of civil war top hats?
---
Shill much? 
---
Found out yesterday from a friend that the alcohol you consume must be one that you brewed and not one that you randomly picked up.  It may it may not be correct, but at this point it sure couldn't hurt.  Also, logging off and then back on ad previously suggested has helped me a time or two as well.   ~ Happy Drunken Trails!
---
I didn't even realize it did this! Thanks for the hint!
---
Dang if you were PS4 i would have offered you some caps or a trade for t60 lol
---
I was doing alright.  They were not doing any damage to me unless they got a stagger shot off. I run cavalier though (less damage while sprinting).  Most fights I was in were very close.  Either I died and they almost did, or they died and I almost did.  From level 40s to level 200s. I could tell some guys had sentinel on but I could still stagger them and get the final hit which was nice.  I'm honestly suprised how balanced it felt for the first day.   5 hours most fun I had in this game after 400+ hours.  
---
How is the year 2019 relevant..?
---
I really don't want to walk around the map just to fetch some underpowered quests items and come back
---
Where do you find bundles? I just logged in and went to the Atomic Shop, but I don't see any bundles anywhere, I feel like I must be blind... 
---
Almost sounds like a scam
---
I also just submitted a ticket to support
---
I've been making Hidden camps in existing unmarked buildings.  If they blow up my benches I'll just find a new house.
---
&gt; and what about the poor 2 radroaches that live there?
---
free food.
---
Subbed to you YT channel - looking forward to seeing your next build!
---
Ok thanks for the heads up. Now I have a new grind to go after!!! Also did not see a really big difference in the CPT and knight paint. Hope it isn’t like that for the rest of them or I am just really blind. Lol!!!
---
Remember, that this is called "Survival Beta."  "Beta" is  Bethesdaspeak meaning "broken mess."  I'm waiting several months before I even think about touching it.   
---
Everyone playing it now are Bethesda's guinea pigs, and will be fuming on here months from now when Bethesda introduces 'balance changes' that make them no longer invincible. 
---
Bingo!
---
Inside there it is quite a pain. But a little patience and spamming the place button will get the job done.
---
As someone who made a new character to try out survival, I'm gonna have to disagree.  You have to think differently about how you're playing the game.  It's not a "bulldoze through all NPCs only going to the quest marker" anymore.
---
For example:
---
&gt;Which means in survival where people camp v76 and overseers camp, zero progress.
---
Place your own camp in an out-of-the-way spot, preferably as soon as you walk out of vault 76.  The woody hillside surrounding the vault gives you lots of places to find cover.  Just don't walk straight to the overseer's camp.
---
More likely AAE, but at the moment it doesn't seem to matter what you use. What matters is that it's explosive, so that it staggers and breaks sentinel.
---
Set a time limit?
---
Allow multiple owners?
---
I am in favor of keeping PVP for workshops, they just need to rework it:
---
- PVP should be contained to the build area of the workshop
---
- Give the owner the option to peacefully relinquish control if it's contested
---
My squad went survivor exclusively. 
---
+1 to CHA
---
I swear, nothing's ever good enough for modern gamers.
---
They take all this effort to give the PVP-obsessed crowd something they actually whined about since release, and they still complain.
---
They don't need to make a third mode.  Maybe tweak the survival beta but another new mode?  Come on...
---
I am really loving the changes, as someone who is 0% interested in PVP.  No more asshats being trolls to satiate their smallness.  If I ever want to PVP, I can take my character to that world and risk more stuff for more reward.  It seems totally fair to me.  And leaderboards are a staple of PVP games.
---
I won't downvote you because that would be rude, but I disagree with you.
---
If anything, PVP mode needs even more risk.  Weapons and armor should be dropped when you die in survival.  "Survival" implies one life.
---
Didn’t you guys in the UK have memes banned? If so, then I feel kinda bad.
---
You are free to add me on Xbox, same username. However im not on voice because I play this with my wife and stream at the same time. I literally never hear anyone so it might put some people off. But we always help new players and enjoy running into people. As far as servers go, maybe it's your timezone? I'm EST and servers are always full for me. Definitely plenty of people still playing though. Best of luck!
---
It seems pretty healthy on PC. I see plenty of dots on the map. No populated npc settlements, which often become player hubs, can make it feel empty though.
---
2/3
---
Responders: go to the north edge of the airport, to the vegetable garden. There's a small ridge north-northest with a fence atop it, and the cemetery is just past the fence.
---
Allegheny: from the fast travel point, go in the main gate and make a right through the break in the hedge. Keep going south-southeast and jump over the next hedge, and you're there.
---
Beckley: go to the mining museum workshop, then look east-southeast for a yellow brick church. The cemetery is in the iron fenced yard on the west side of the church.
---
Joining a club was the best move I ever made.  Have a lot of great people to play with and that really enhances the fun. I'm in the rgg groupon xbox.
---
I play (pc tho). Most of the ti…e I just don't use my Mike because I don't want to talk to a bunch of random people (I tend to solo a lot of stuff)
---
Thats as close to Harper's Ferry you can get now? My base used to be in that same spot just on the opposite bank
---
Nah the grievers would just hide or retreat for 10 or whatever seconds as you spawn, then resume the asshattery. It would just prolong the inevitable. The only thing that would fix this is random respawn locations, so spawn location camping simply couldnt be possible. They already have this in the game with the nukashine blackout, they just need to adjust a version for when players are killed.  
---
Looking through your past comments, that is your PSN name. What a load of shit
---
I'm in GE and I always find ppl, without no Mic tho. I'm also on xbox and I'm down to play. Usually get on around 8pm our time
---
Not much of a difference between most of them, other than the Insignia/Emblem on the armor.
---
I think the Paladin armor has some Orange highlights on the arms, and one other of the group does.  Paladin looks the best out of all of them color scheme-wise I think.  Opinions and all that.
---
Maybe they could do something like give you a perk card every level.
---
:rolleyes:
---
Once you hit top 3, that is when the survival starts, before that is just foreplay.
---
It doesn’t work on any type of shotgun for me 
---
Damn I keep running into PS4 users on here.  I actually found a lot of legendary weapons with explosive (2*) and when they were still over powered I used to kill myself by shooting a wall nearby.  They were way stronger before lol.   Even then I put on fireproof and I stopped taking damage from my own gun lol.   But seriously it's not so strong now anyway, my TSE shotgun is in storage on my alt now lol.  Fireproof alone was enough for me cuz I was a power armor user.  But for regular armor they all have a dense mod, can find server hopping at vendors if you can't find someone to craft it.
---
I concur
---
I've gotten travel agent at least twice on my newest character. First one was cool, gonna pick you up eventually anyways, cause it gave it to me 15 levels shy of being able to use it.
---
Next card pack, what do you know, travel agent!
---
Gtfo with that.
---
Sure real card packs, that's a possibility. But it just seems so utterly pointless. 
---
I'm glad you had what it took to post this because I don't have it in me but well done. This mode is far broken, but one thing that killed it for me as I did post about it was the reward for murdering, which again the "lore of the WHOLE game is based to NOT to do is now the whole point WTF!!!" So you would think at least the mode would make it so camping and or weapon type and or vs. armour type would make sense or any of the points you made in this post. But not one simple logical easy real world, nor anything that is done in any other game that is on the market that is like this already, made it into this mode... WHY?!?!
---
I said it over and over before survival mode released - 20% exp is not even remotely worth it for all the concessions you have to make to play on survival. I got done in 3 hours what normally takes me 30 minutes last night, when playing survival, due to all the pvp. It was fun, but today I'm back to adventure mode and I probably won't look back.
---
so, everyone then\~
---
You're very narrow minded.  Nobody is suggesting any PVP on adventure.
---
 But the fact that you call anybody that likes the thrill of PvP scum is a bit ridiculous.
---
 I would never initiate a battle between somebody but I would dam sure fight back. Does that make me scum?
---
It's a thing because people insist on spawning at the same place over and over. Spawn somewhere else and it won't be a thing anymore.
---
It is. His PSN name is the one listed above according to his post history. The whole thing is a lie.
---
Thank you kind sir! 
---
duplicates are necessary for re-speccing and wanting to use 1 or 2 stars of a card vs 3 so you can swap in other cards.
---
3*s at Fort Defiance are definitely rare, but not as rare as 2*s for some reason. In my 10 or so runs there I found 3 3*s, a ton of 1*s, but not a single 2*.
---
The sad part is it is known by the true PvP crowd. It’s just drown out by all the people who don’t play PvP games but “want to try it out because it’s Fallout.”
---
Unfortunately, you can’t have your cake and eat it too. PvP requires as little randomness as possible. Weapons and protections need to have **set** values outside of MOBAs (which are dice rolls). 
---
I didn't expect being alive long would make you wanted. I'm alive long because I'm trying to survive and stay TF away from people! I want to play in survival not to be in a meat grinder but to have some of the comfort stripped from the moment.
---
This is like a forgot to switch accounts thing.
---
And it's not even a trick.  Shit, I'll make anybody as many civil war top hats as they can fucking carry.  They cost 1 cloth!
---
I didnt pay a dime, I had over 3000 atom from playing the game.
---
Most of that area was over populated with gun fire. As a new character, it will be rough doing things in order, but there are still level zones. With no armor or weapons, its rough getting out of the starting zone.
---
Well, now that you know someone is always camping the stations, hunt them. Best way to take down campers. 
---
It literally says pump action shotgun when you are buying it 
---
Going off topic here... How is Elite Dangerous? 
---
Yeah it really sucks. I had started a new character purely for survival, because it would be challenging. The first survival server I go on, there are like 3 different people camping out vault 76, so I lost the five free stimpacks I had, the purified water, and the free junk.
---
Really could have sworn it was lv50
---
I’m avoiding that clusterfuck mode. I hope others are having fun with it.
---
If I wanted to play Fortnite, I'd be playing Fortnite.
---
Gonna need to put a lockable door on your bathrooms folks, I don't need to be surprised on the throne by random players or some scorched walking in on me.
---
Due to Borderlands, I have to check every porta-potty. This could get awkward.
---
I'm in the same boat man. If you see someone firing while moving there's a good chance that they're not Sent Assassin and fair game. If you see someone hopping up and down in one place while shooting or not moving or trying to find cover in a firefight it's def best to disengage and get out of there. 
---
Adventure mode for sir
---
So in several months, when everyone who rolled a new character on survival mode servers are level 200+ in full gg pvp gear, a new player buys the games and rolls a new character on the survival mode servers, how will it be different for them than what it is, now? Will they be forced onto a level restricted, empty server since everyone else is level 200+? If you roll an alt, you can't join friends that are level 200+, and vice versa?
---
Just trying to understand this from a design perspective. The game doesn't have persistent servers like an MMO. Your characters are not tied to a specific server, nor a specific group of players. Putting level cap/restrictions seems redundant when eventually, everyone who now rolls a new character will end up being 200+. I think Bethesda already realized this, that's why survival is the way it is. It's also probably why they allowed switching back and forth between adventure and survival, since it's a compromise to having level restricted survival servers.
---
Cool thank you
---
Sir... Sir, i lost 35 stimpaks after dyong twice. 35. FUCKING. STIMPAKS. (And all of my dog food and purified water)
---
Gamemode is bullshit, wont even going to try it again ever
---
Players aren't taking caps into Survival.
---
If you have no caps, you don't lose any and the other guy gains none.
---
It’s aggravating after you eat a ton of food to boost up then u get d/c d and loose it all. That didn’t used to happen am I right?
---
But what if he's a Nigerian Prince that needs help with a bank transaction?
---
Honestly thank you so much for this post, it helped me a lot today and changed my mindset about Survival enough to have a really good time when I hated it last night.
---
I topped the leaderboard and started getting hunted by a group of three players, lured them into an enclosed building and waited for them to come in before lobbing 10 grenades that I had stockpiled just for this moment. Killed 2/3 of them and profited 200 caps before dying despite their vastly superior equipment and finished builds. This was at level 7.
---
Party up and get it to 50% as well.
---
dying by nuke bomb should give you 15 minute RAD immunity when you res.. 
---
You brought up a good point about the lore around this game is to rebuild West Virginia.  Honestly, I never even put that into consideration.  At the same time, the rebuilding of WV includes accessing 1 of 3 silos to launch nukes.  Although, you could argue that it is to "purge" WV of the scorched threat I guess.  The only way I can see it justifying PVP lore-wise is that this is the return of the raiders as a faction.  Maybe we'll have NPC's further down that will be a raider faction and if there are some of us role playing that in Survival it will make better sense.  
---
I love how you just pop on the flashlight and look around like... omg, did I just... is he.... 
---
If you PVP with zero caps you are supposed to have a 50% or so damage penalty.
---
A guy I was playing with and I had both made new characters for survival only. It’s kind of fun being freaked out, never knowing when you’ll suddenly get the JFK experience.
---
I SHOULDN'T FUCKING HAVE TO SPAWN ELSEWHERE
---
I was just wondering what the effective range was. It was definately outside of the normal range of my rifle (180+), and it was definately a shotgun, as I saw the explosive spread and bursts.
---
He was full health, and I wasn't, so it wasn't bloodied or instigating boosts.
---
Still trying to get those plans.
---
I was tempted last night to do a solo silo and surprise everyone testing out the mode with a queen event, but my paranoia got to me as I imagined being right near the end ready to click in the code and a group of 2 or 3 guys storm in behind me like thanks for clearing it out for us \*Bang\*.   
---
are you so fucking dense that you don't realize I SHOULDN'T FUCKING HAVE TO AVOID A SPAWN POINT
---
When you stash your caps and go pvp in survival you are deliberately undermining one of the major risks designed to be a part of the game. That is an exploit, and you certainly can't expect other players to do that as part of the norm. 
---
So it's begun.
---
PVP players are getting their asses handed to them and they demand things be removed from the game.
---
Na, I'm gonna keep playing it.
---
im still waiting for my 4* AAE to drop for me
---
"Oh no... he is..."
---
I carry a nukashine in my inventory as an option. been scrounging, way over weight and no place in sight to scrap? Take a drink and roll the dice. Hope you land closer to a place to scrap.
---
50/50, sometimes more
---
Yeah that totally sucks 
---
Bethesda made Fallout76 a tea-party experience because of you. If this was ten years ago F76 would require you to pick a faction/role at the beginning of the game like a raider or a feral ghoul. instead everyone is a goody doody in this game. it goes 100% against the nature of Fallout
---
I played for a few hours, it was kinda neat, but you are 100% correct.
---
It only encourages the "death match" type of play. It's not survival Fallout where you go along playing the actual game and then other players may or may not be hostile. 
---
I was thinking about it and the way I would work the actual survival game is when players are in the same event they can't damage each other. The event areas are usually pretty big, so I think it won't be a problem with people camping on the border of the event to attack. Plus you can fast travel to a station or camp after the event completes. Maybe have a 3 minute cool down after an event where the no-damage is still on so you can loot and then bounce.
---
Underneath the tree a high level large creature spawns like a lvl 70 fog crawler or lvl 60 mega sloth.
---
ESO balancing group PVE is not the same as balancing PVP.
---
Again, fireproof.  Level 100 has it max, level 10 has none.  You can't balance that without something dumb like giving max fireproof to all level 10s.  Which then causes problems because you have to take that away at some point or there's no point in perk cards.
---
I moved 20k to mule too. They better remove caps reward for kill. And how much of aid drops from you. My only problem with survival so far. My gf enjoyed it too, until we had team fight with us and as we lost, then win with only loosing things and caps in the end.
---
"Shaka, when the walls fell..."
---
Good thing Bethesda isn't in the casino business. Their inability to understand the most basic concepts of making a fair game that can't be cheated is astonishing.
---
Bulldozing has been working fine for me on xb1.
---
what were the other 2*
---
it was in the front page of the atom store.
---
Also go ahead and invest in reactive plates to counter melees. It reflects 50% of the damage back on them which when they're using bloodied weapons that do 1000+ damage means they kill themselves. 
---
A good way for a gang to lure in victims, really.
---
Guess he wasn't stealth enough 
---
I will take your word on that one. I would rather they all have a difference in them like a color scheme to tell the different.Or even as small as a rank on the shoulder. But that is not a decision I can make. But a grind is a grind. Thanks again!
---
Don't forget that there is the plain fact that you will get spawn killed to death. There is no brief invincibility when spawned. Just death. Pure unadulterated death.
---
I've seen a couple weird spawns lately. I was in the Watoga Municipal Building last night and instead of the usual Scorched, the place had a bunch of Gutsys (Gutsies?  What's the plural of Gutsy??) 
---
Bethesda. Bethesda never changes.
---
Or you can git gud
---
I mean they're not garbage, theyre still second or third best depending on who you ask. 
---
Camden park has some of them, Grafton park has the rest. They seem to carry a different mix each
---
I tested that theory as well. I drank 8 whiskeys that we'll call old Whiskey, and 5 whiskeys "fresh" out of the fermentor but still had no luck. My character is very addicted at this point lol.
---
The more I read the more it seems like it's the server that is the issue. A server hop would likely help me, but I don't feel like we should have to hop everytime this issue arises. I for one enjoy taking workshops which really messes up my flow If I have to leave the current server I've invested in.
---
It will depend on your mods and maybe perk cards.  Without boosts (at least against mobs), it's tiny.  Not sure if it is different in PvP, and explosive is a totally different situation (explosive effect *might* fully trigger at max range, where the pellets don't).
---
Fire resist is your friend (if you don't already have that...if you do, no ideas).
---
Going to the bathroom should be a safe zone... so you can go to the bathroom or grab a bite to eat without worry of being killed or having all your food go bad. 
---
Bathrooms=AFK.
---
If I remember correctly Vault 94 was given a GECK that was mishandled somehow and exploded, which is why the Mire is what it is.
---
Yes, there is no escaping the mark.
---
You know theres a challenge to get a legendary weapon if you kill 25 legendaries in Survival right?
---
Then don't play it. Plenty of people are enjoying it.
---
Morgantown station definitely doesn't as of last night. I got double killed good.
---
Thanks did anyone see the others skins for other armors available also? Or the hunting rifle? It seems the only skins I have from this bundle are for power armor.... 
---
Found out yesterday from a friend that the alcohol you consume must be one that you brewed and not one that you randomly picked up.  It may it may not be correct, but at this point it sure couldn't hurt.  Also, logging off and then back on as previously suggested has helped me a time or two as well.   ~ Happy Drunken Trails!
---
We have temporarily disabled the Survivor’s Camo Bundle in the Atomic Shop in order to address an issue in which players who purchased the bundle did not receive the Tactical Pump Action Shotgun paint it contained. 
---
Once the fix is live, our top priority is to ensure that players who had already purchased the bundle can correctly access their Shotgun paint. As soon as I have more to share about that I'll be sure to update this post.
---
Thanks for your reports and apologies for any inconvenience!
---
I whole heartedly disagree. In my experience at launch the game was 100% unplayable. I know some people had no issues, but for me and most others I've talked to the game was laggy unplayable garbage. It's okay now though
---
Only Bethesda calls something a "beta" when it's on live servers and any consequences you suffer persist to the live game.
---
&gt; **(Observation)** Basing caps lost/gained on a player's level beyond 50 effectively punishes players that have invested more time playing your game. Generally games like to give incentives for playing longer, not punishment... 
---
This.
---
The patch notes ***CLEARLY*** spelled out what the risks were.
---
I'd like that Survival was a mode where you CAN kill other players, not where  you MUST kill other players. Unfortunately the mode is targeted towards obligatory pvp but it would be nice a world dangerous and risky but not perforce hostile at "last man standing"
---
They need to move the no build zones further away from the train stations, saw countless groups of 4 in sniper perches just camping the spawns. It’s pretty sad that some people find standing in one spot for hours and engaging in 4v1 fun.
---
I don't get what you're saying. If players don't want to lose mad caps, they can just go adventure mode man. The survival mode servers were made this way for a reason, big risk = big rewards. 
---
Love this post.  It's so fallout lol
---
it's not always there but if you are checking the roof after every west tek clearing you will find them
---
Metro Exodus is pretty sick. Very different from fallout despite the huge amount of similarities. I found it very enjoyable.
---
It's somewhat counterintuitive, but Damage Resistance isn't all its cracked up to be.  As you discovered, the best stuff is flat damage reduction, whether that's Sentinel gear, or perks like Lone Wanderer, Dodgy, Serendipity, Fireproof, mods like Dense, etc.  The same is true of Adventure Mode.
---
I heard the rewards are not that great.
---
Actually there should be a 3rd survival bar under food &amp; water that increases each time you eat or drink. You need to find a place to empty the bar occasionally...
---
Yeah, max Fireproof. Don't have a dense mod, but have the lesser explosive resist mods on armor.
---
Just curiosity.
---
Or they're going to have to be careful and do things like leaving NPCs alive so they react to that level 100 who just walked into the area.  Those annoying level 1 mole rats can be handy.
---
Also, killing mobs at various spawns gives more exp than completing the early quests, so not following the quest chain until the area looks safe is viable.
---
My only complaint is I don't see how to do the first 20ish levels without a sneak build.  But that's not a very large issue since you can effectively respec relatively easily.
---
Good to know. But at the same time that feels like cheating :D
---
Mack has some prepaid ones that show up randomly, but no plans. Grafton is the other vendor 
---
It was. It said limited time 6 days yesterday. Right now, it is not there. I wonder if they pulled it because of the issue with the pump shotgun skin not working?
---
Im not much into PvP to be honest, but im not 100% opposed to the idea, especially now that it is its own mode. I am opposed to losing 1k caps in 2 min because someone is oneshotting me in the back with a TSE shotty before i even have a chance to move. 
---
I have never played fortnite but from the streams I've seen thats not how fortnite plays.
---
&gt;Dunno what I even expected from Bethesda really, they have really let me and the majority of their fans down.
---
1) It's a BETA
---
2) Plenty of people are enjoying the new mode. You and your friends are not a majority
---
Well, garbage for a guy not fully specced for it.  I use ranged as a backup weapon.  Unarmed primary.  But yeah in survival a pipe rifle could still be good lol
---
well I'm not saying he didn't get them legit , but what sounds more plausible he won the pie machine 100 times , or after every west tek clearing he went to the roof to check for a pie?
---
Nope, it and gauss max at 45, probably others as well. 
---
So?
---
It's a play style that the very concept is people are always trying to kill you.  Enjoy, glad it's not in Adventure mode anymore. :)
---
Thanks all! Graveyard found and pic taken :)
---
Watoga now spawns Gutsys after the first round of protectrons are gone
---
I havent noticed that. In fact I was able to get an Assassins Cavalier Combat leg over lunch... That and many other legendaries.  Seemed pretty much the same to me.
---
And by your logic, your luck is the same as everyone elses, so they have to be duped items if you haven't seen them drop?
---
In Watoga, Marine Armor drops a lot from the legendary bots.
---
Also, you can find plans for *all* the Marine gear onside a train car in Watoga on the tracks.  They clip into the top of a stack of boxes a bit, though.
---
&gt;  I have more resistance than he has and especially a few weapons that were pretty strong enough to take on anybody which is a normal standard Lever action rifle as well as a vampire 10mm submachine gun. 
---
I'm confused. You clearly do not have more resistance than he  has considering he has sentinel armor. He had a bloodied build which is why he stayed low HP and was one shotting you. Also, the weapons you have don't stand a chance against an end game player with decent gear. 
---
Not to mention your whole strategy was build up your base and live the longest? That's asking for people to come over and destroy everything. 
---
They always had they are fun!
---
Ok. I understand you. For me yesterday i have kept 1.5k on me. But the point is more of the caps cap problem for me. For me its 600 caps per death. I think its nonsense to punish more old players when the cap lvl is 50. But I agree with you that many take no caps at all. In that way yes its an exploit.
---
Well in any case I really want tse lever action 
---
if its anything like the legionaries that i get regularly, then its not worth it.
---
I'll wait to hear what ppl. get.
---
It's a game where players are constantly reset and "levels" are artificially kept similar.  Like all of the arena-style pvp games.  You are proposing the same mechanics.
---
You should drop everything your are carrying when killed.  You should be able to take an adventure character to survival, but not return. This would create balance.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
---
This is awesome! Thank yoy
---
Found a guy's base near whitespring station yesterday. Friend of mine decide to hide inside and await his return. Instead, we get ganked by his rocket turrets and he comes out of the base and takes our loot. We return, get some high ground. Friend starts pummeling his base with an auto grenade launcher to draw him out, I lie in wait and hit him with my gatling gun once he comes out.
---
10/10
---
I was never in the death match PvP crowd.  I never asked for anything close to what they gave us.
---
 I want the occasional PVP but I Don't want it forced on me like they have it in the survival mode.
---
 I want a real survival mode not an arcade style death match battle royale type mess.
---
 I enjoy playing adventure mode as much as the next person. I've leveled my main to 150.
---
 It would not bother me one bit to start a new character over and a true survival type mode. 
---
 If you don't like my ideas or opinions that's fine you have every right to but it seems a lot of people seem to think it's a good idea.
---
Here’s the thing - you’re right that it would only be a temporary solution. However, fresh characters would not only get rid of the duped items, but also the leveling exploits that took place during the game’s first few weeks. It would take a bit for people to level up(xp rates are much lower than they were in 11/2018-12/2018), and it would take even longer for folks to find the exact legendaries they’re using now, as they would each need to drop rather than a simple drop being endlessly duped.
---
Again not a permanent solution, but it would certainly give Bethesda some time to work on the current issues, rather than turning so many players immediately off w/ a bad initial experience
---
Throw a pumpkin grenade, that'll make them move lol.
---
You’re clearly too fucking dense to realize you’re a contradicting hypocrite 
---
I completely disagree, all they need is additional tweaking to damage normalisation. Not a big issue.
---
&gt; the weapons you have don't stand a chance against an end game player with decent gear.
---
&gt; standard Lever action rifle
---
Yeah, I have switchblades that do more damage.
---
If not that, at the very least be able to mark cards as inactive / hidden so they don’t clutter up your selection screen. If you need to review them, hit key to “show hidden”. Outside of hacking / lock picking or occasional crafting and camp building swaps, I could easily move about 75% of my unequipped cards to hidden state...
---
I agree. 
---
And if the owner is not there,  no fast travel allowed and the time go at double speed. 
---
It’s a cheat. If someone can kill everyone at once and your on PC always assume it’s a cheat.
---
Oops, meant to write invincibility. Thanks.
---
Sorry
---
Every day when doing my vendor runs I check the orange boxcar near the station. Most often if there’s a plan there, it’s marine armor. 
---
Maybe its me. I used to fuck around the bunker till people left the clubhouse (on a fresh login) then I would wonder over there and a fresh set would spawn. So long as it was my first time walking over there. Just as of late its been nothing. I remember last month I'd spend hours there cause the legendaries didnt stop spawning
---
I only want them to remove one shot weapons, make fast travel locations "no C.A.M.P. zone" and make balances to items.
---
I mean, if you play a couple hours a day, assassin/sentinel/cavalier stuff is really not that hard to get.  I used to scrap that stuff regularly because I had too much of it ( now I save it to give away to others), and I've never exploited and only have 450 hours total.
---
As for one-shotting, they should really be nerfing PVP damage so those fights are more drawn out.  And there should be a cap on what a single bullet or melee swing does for damage.  Obviously this cap would depend on the gun type and differ for rifles vs. heavy guns, etc.
---
I was having a lot of success with high rate of fire semi auto TSE rifles last night, Tesla, Handmade, Laser Rifle. I'm still not convinced that the extra explosive damage is worth the perk cards for it though. 
---
Good.
---
Now kill him again.
---
Sweet, just as I'm running short on toothpicks ...
---
I'm loving it.  Played with some low level friends (no not a group of level 300's murdering noobs contrary to the fake news) and we played for a solid 5 hours.  Very fun.  Died, killed. But every fight was close and I may have been one shot only once but I'm a bloodied build so it's hard to say if it was a one shot or it I was just too low to begin with lol
---
What is the short and long suits? 
---
Seems well sounded. But I don’t think perks are the immediate need for change. 
---
I think first before anything legendary weapons And armour need to fixed. The current ones are holding back creativity. Everyone is running bloodied this and bloodied that. Sentinel so and so. The list goes on. 
---
Cookie cutting builds just wasted potential. 
---
Why would I do that and then get murdered by people 200 levels higher than me who are just camping Vault 76?
---
Because I don't understand how you don't see after day 1 even with new characters, there will be a massive level difference between said characters. 
---
Ahh K I was proposing a mechanic similar to Rust a pvp survival game similar to F76 were most servers reset at least once a month.
---
2, 4 and 5 are SPOT on, but for 1) they already helped prevent this with the recent rebalance, if they did something like only 25% damage max a shot it would kill a lot of builds. 3) Bloodied does work as intended, it makes the person using it a glass cannon. Not much you can do about that, but I'd recommend nerfing other low health effects. The main issue is Anti armor which ensures one shots against anyone, along with the necessity of sentinel/cavalier armor. my opinion anyway
---
This post absolutely nails it. 
---
The only thing left that really needs to be looked at is the legendary effects of weapons and levelled gear in general. For the playing field to be levelled long term then weapons and armour need to be rebalanced so that the gap between the god tier and the weak is much smaller. In a competitive PvP environment the main driving force behind the winning party should be determined primarily by Witt and skill. The current system, in particular legendary stats will make the experience unattractive to new players. 
---
Legendary gear needs to be tuned for PvP with huge nerfs. A player with a pipe pistol and crap gear should have a chance against the big boys, even if that chance is pretty small. 
---
I think requiring new players was also designed to eliminate all of the duped trash from entering pvp
---
Lol This guys not a PvP player, he specifically said he built a base so he doesn’t have to fight anybody. Probably some PvE troll just feeding into the hate train since they’re all mad PvP players kept explaining to them that workshops are PvP zones. It’s pretty funny seeing just how toxic the PvE community is being rn.
---
I guess you could say that because of the ROSE side quest - but lol - BIG BUTT lol - we all grew up in 76 so I know in the real world we turn on each other so it would be likely but after what happens it still don't sit that pretty with me...
---
Could be your internet
---
Yeah I mean they are pretty balanced now in my opinion.  Before they were much stronger and people keep acting like they still are so I over emphasize by calling them garbage.  They are useful to some, before, useful to all.  Now my bloodied handmade makes a much better backup weapon for me.
---
Lmao. Are you mentally challenged, u/MadMusicScoop? 
---
How did you lose ammo and gear from a server crash?
---
Duping is still a thing and even still killing people with fully duped kits is so damn easy since they don't know how to play they just think armor is what maters not playstyle
---
Guess it’s time Scour the archives
---
Survival Mode is the definitive shit. Its plagued with TSE duppers that oneshot you no matter you do. So until you need to create a new character and disable all legendaries in survival for balance purposes I go back to play Sekiro, at least that game it's difficult but balanced.
---
Here take an upvote. This just about sums it up. I doubt Bethesda entirely bases the game changes they make on what this Reddit sub says.. Being that almost everything gets blown out of proportion and tons of inexperienced people that don’t read/are slow/just plain bad at the game complain on here at the first sign of trouble.
---
With that being said I do think they could come to the middle of everyone desires and tweak the Survival Beta a little. 
---
The top 3 on the Leaderboard should be ranked by the amount of player kills they have. It only makes sense to have the people that want to kill players in mass be visible on the map. The current system punishes people for surviving the longest? You would think they would want to reward surviving the longest and killing less. There is no tension when you expect to be killed 100% of the time. It just ends up being like GTA Online. 
---
I am curious what he was trying to scam out of people.
---
Nah fam this shit is fun, I'm getting my ass kicked with my new character and I'm loving it!!!
---
Ok, let me backtrack a bit.  This COULD be a good idea but it's too soon.  Survival is still in beta, desgining another new mode so soon would be a lot of work.  Not necessarily a bad idea though.  But I consider the "Adventure" mode to pretty much be what traditional "Survival" is.  I think Survival is just badly named, as you mentioned.  Lol
---
Lost 4k caps in 5 min yesterday, had a blast, I am full of respect for the cleverness of the guys who shredded us despite our good gear and number advantage. The thing is for me it was great because I fought and I failed. I learned, and plan to evolve beyond that problem. Casual players, on the other hand, most often simply lack time to dedicate themselves so much to a game to be fighting for the place on the top, especially if their progress would be taken away from them. I am pretty sure this mechanism of damage prevention works sometimes but it genrally bugged. I spawned into V76 hearing a super sledge sound in the direct vicinity of my left ear. I was able to get away and kill the fucker, but next round I though I'd kill him before he closed the distance and I didn't,  dropped down dead in 2 hits. I heard at least seven hits before I loaded and they did nothing.
---
I was a thing and it has been patched 
---
people dont grind for that gear do they? i thought they all just bought it from questionable sources 
---
Ayy someone else who agrees with me 
---
The new pvp is nice and decent for once this is what I thought pvp would be like
---
Full Cav armor since December. Wonder how ya got that. 
---
Yep, which they could absolutely still work on, and then revisit allowing existing characters later even as early as a few months
---
Just make our stash boxes account wide... increase the storage to 2000 and job done.
---
Glad to see the griefing has moved to PVP.  Let it roll bitches, let it roll.  I'll be happy to never see those folks again.
---
&gt; Safe zone(s): 
---
Whole Adventure Mode is big f#cking safe zone now.
---
&gt; Because, well, you can't trust anyone 
---
Idk, I have done with events with random people in survival mode. Sadly there is no way to communicate each so, as long as you don't look each other with hostility, you don't have much to worry.  
---
&gt; But in a Safe Zone you can talk with someone 
---
yeah, here is where I am gonna stop you...How I am supposed to talk someone when we don't even have text chat? Emoticons? As I mentioned earlier all this can be done in Adventure Mode or in official discord.
---
&gt; As expected, the only viable "build" (if we can call it that) is a full set of Sentinel/Assassins or Cavalier/Assassins 
---
idk. I have 4/5 assassin set  without defensive mods  and I am doing fine. And assassin set aint something that only most hardcore players can use. You can easily buy it from players. I think thing to worry about is rather ranged VATS build.
---
This doesn't answer my question, but okay.
---
You're right but even if people start over, they can just use a mule to transfer their items from their main to their alt once they hit 45 or 50 and with the 20% xp gain, that will happen soon enough
---
i like the idea of having free pvp and hidden player icons for that extra feel of danger, but when people are able to kill with 1 shot weapons because they are for some reason allowed to take them into a world that is mixed with lvl 200s and 15s.
---
basically: good idea, bad implementation
---
The way worded your post made it seem like you spent real money.
---
Really really good, best played when you have a lot of downtime and with a group of friends. I have 400\~ ish hours in it and I finally own all the ships I want and have them all engineered. It doesn't hold your hand at the beginning, it took me maybe 10-20 hours before I felt like I was fully in control and could out maneuver enemies. It has one of the highest rates of new player drop I've ever seen (Every single achievement in the game on Xbox is a rare achievement). Stick with it and it's totally worth it. 
---
I see what you are saying. Beth tried to artificially inflate tension by making you lose all your items but completely failed at it leaving a broken and unbalanced mess. If you had a character locked to survival it would already be more tense and you would get more encounters where people aren’t just openly hostile and you can’t just switch gamemodes when you felt too pressured.
---
What they did change is how the enemies spawn.  If you go to WesTek, there will be super mutants outside, but inside they may not be there, and there is some duration until they spawn inside again. That’s probably what you had read regarding the 10min thing.
---
Last night the mobs seemed to appear at the clubhouse everytime a new player showed up, but after they all died, there was a bit of “calm” before the next wave now that I think about it. The artisans shoppes and gold course seemed to respawn at the normal rate. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Can we get a survival mode without PVP and solo?
---
I agree with you.  Just letting you know there's a work around
---
They are just begging for free shit.
---
They even went with the "real life is hard I have mental issues" story.
---
I was thinking that it'd be cool if we could build in existing buildings or claim them like a workshop that would be tied to your character between servers like the camp.
---
What about no legendaries in survival mode? Too far? 
---
Dude the only reports of the masks is from things with dev rooms that have been accessed
---
A full set os Assassin's Sentinel doesn't make you invincible...
---
Good to know
---
Sounds like a side effect of carrying to much. I know the risks when carrying so much. The map takes longer to load, disconnects and even invisible enimes. Try reducing your weight 
---
Wow, a lot more than I thought
---
Definitely! I know most posts and comments insist there are only 2 absolute options, but the best answer very well could be a shade of grey somewhere in the middle
---
It’s all anecdotal but even pre-patch I would occasionally get zero legendaries at the golf course clubhouse. It only happened like twice and usually it’s closer to 5 or 6. 
---
He's complaining because he can't access the account with all the good weapons and armor. Like a full set of Cav armor he just randomly picked up off drops lol. 
---
Yeah but the OP said container loot wasn’t there as well, that should’ve reset after the first day but for some reason it’s empty for 2 days? Sounds a little buggy to me.
---
I dunno it did get pretty bad for awhile. Notably when they patched it and rebroke a few things.
---
The first couple months were literally one disaster after another. The game has came a *long* way since then though.
---
Because they roll back and I drop it to transfer. between me and someone else! Cursing the game and cursing the developers for releasing such a broken mess!
---
You can still one shot I do it all the time it's was a lie 
---
Checkout this guy 🙄
---
this or make toilets drinkable again like in fallout nv
---
Ah, I thought they fixed duping
---
Used to test games for Epic Megagames just when the first Unreal was released! 
---
For people (like myself) that forgot to hit the stash box and lost about 90% of my aid items after 3 straight deaths...we would probably argue that the aid loss is quite excessive. 
---
My friend saw the message and was like, nooooo!
---
My internet is perfectly fine.
---
Anything is better then the way survival is looking right now 
---
Nah they haven't it's just harder but still doable
---
The reason is not caps or bag drops but just the LOLs I’d think, really though how boring and pointless.
---
Theres no danger if everyone is damage sponges. Makes no sense. Gotta balance your risk and reward. If you cant hang then go practice more in adventure. Its honestly really simple
---
Not sure how you ended up with that rant, the problem is pretty simple.  Way too many people have amazing shit that players just starting in the game (or that didn't cheat and played casually) cannot cope with and are effectively useless against.  Folks buying the game to try the new survival mode aren't likely to expect five month old characters from other modes being there.
---
The duping and exploiting (exploit here meaning using ultra-efficient and non-cheating ways to obtain things) means many players have infinite everything and don't care if they die and lose their aid, etc.  They just dump every buff and use their TSE or other uber weapon they got farming in a mostly PVP-free mode to pvp with.  That's stupid.
---
I have handed about 20 different Tech data items in and I think the best I have received is a few Stimpaks.
---
Why don't I ever get BOS paint or plans!! :-(
---
And thats bs. I know its a good reason and stops people from farming but fuck.
---
I leanred the spawn triggers and it was just fun to run through.
---
And that explains my new god power. Where enemies look upon me and just cant stand the sight of my awesomeness and explode.
---
That’s what I was doing, reducing weight ;(
---
Appreciate your help, thanks buddy.
---
Hey, so yea i decided to just buy it. Where can you find it for $20? I can't find it for under $35. 
---
The problem with the current iteration is they are trying to please everyone and ended up pleasing noone. You can’t not have a character lock, and allow people to bring their high level characters and try to artificially balance weapons so a level 45 is on the same playing field as a level 300. It just ends up a broken mess where noone is happy, which is what I feel majority aren’t right now. They need to pick one or the other and not have survival team deathmatch like how it is now, those two modes are completely opposite each other.
---
I think they’re just a random spawn, I found them about a month ago in Blackwater mine by where the boss enemy spawns. Higher level areas are probably a higher drop rate tho but who knows?
---
It's not a random legendary... You can go look what it is right now. Apparently you didn't actually read anything about the update.
---
Scammer
---
That would hurt people with 5+ characters and hurt the server stability based on what they say. While i want 3000 stash i can't get behind this
---
Might I suggest a Gear Score tiering system?
---
Serverz are fixed man! [Here's da proof](https://imgur.com/A5rckzi)! 
---
you attach them to a weapon or armor pierce when you learn the plan. then you modify it
---
Yeah I loved hardcore mode in FO4.  I'd be happy with a modified version of that, without the extra PvP stuff.  Call it "co-op survival" or "hardcore adventure".
---
I think the "fast travel to stations only" is a good alternative to no fast travel, so keep that.  Stimpaks no longer heal crippled limbs, you have to sleep (since there are no doctors).  
---
Make diseases easier to get and harder to get rid off (like disease cures only work 25% of the time or something).  
---
Add a sleep/exhaustion bar, which can be satiated with Nuka Cola and coffee but depletes faster with certain drugs (downers like Med-X and alcohol) and withdrawals (crashing after uppers like psycho or mentats).  When you are tired, instead of reducing max AP like hunger and thirst, it reduces your AP regen.  If you're completely exhausted, you don't regen AP at all.  
---
Buff all enemies a little (maybe extra armor penetration across the board)
---
Feel free to add me as well, same username.
---
Thanks for trying to cheer me up, but i’m Broken :(
---
Ive had a number of good drops since patchx 7.5.  One was a bloodied tesla rifle, along with several 3* armor. Maybe they buffed the legendaries but reduced the spawn duration/frequency.
---
A bit of topic but if I were to start a new character, would that character gain atoms from the challenges like the reach level 10, 20 etc challenges? Seeing that survival gives a 20% xp boost has gotten me interested in starting a new character specifically for survival.
---
I was so worried for a second that I had misread days as hours when I first saw the bundle and I had missed out. May I suggest having it as "Temporarily unavailable" but up in the Atomic Shop until the issue is resolved?
---
Problem is stealth perks dont actually help with stealth. You can invest in everything but sneak and still get chameleon and sneak just as good in pvp. 
---
I'm so tired of all the people who make those kinds of claims. The majority of people on here don't understand game design and development choices.
---
Not ignoring the game does have some issues, they're just not as bad as the vocal minority of the overall player base makes them out to be. 
---
Nice, I’ll try to catch it on a steam sale sometime. I am a fan of No Man’s Sky which is kind of the super chill alternative to ED. 
---
I love how fucking stupid people are being in their disagreements with you.  Taking characters with five months worth of shit, effectively infinite resources and buffs, and the best weapons in the game, into a fresh PVP mode is stupid.
---
No, the problem will not be there in a month when everyone levels if survival forced new characters because those with ludacris amounts of resources won't exist to start, and to the extent they still exist now, ever.  Nobody will have thousands of aid items, or the best-rolled guns in the game, etc.  They'll never get what they got thanks to exploits and duping again.  This fixes the problems left from those issues that weren't caught when they banned the cheaters, etc.  Most never got banned and still have tons of their shit across multiple characters.
---
There won't be any hype train to begin with, the game released like a pile of crap and that is what public perception will be for the end of time.
---
I have the plans on xbone but am currently at MAD CAPS....err, I mean max caps. 
---
That’s was my first thought. 
---
Sounds like you did it to yourself.
---
Well thats the risk you run. I have lost many of shit. My average weight is around 1k. It does have its benefits but you just cant get annoyed when shit goes missing or you frezze when breaking shit down cause the game cant handle that
---
**New Disease: The Rad Runs**
---
I’ve never really sussed it out either, I find them and sell them or ignore them. It is something to help with lack of materials to mod stuff I think but I’m always drowning in mats these boxes are of no use to me.
---
I don't want to PVP in this game, but it's nice to know that if I get that old urge to be competitive, this one now an arena where everyone is on the same page about what can happen.
---
This is true as hell 
---
I ddidbt normally start pvp prepatch but post pvp update I'm already making bank from killing trolls
---
Not in Survival, it isn't.
---
I think it should be permanent with the loot table of the masks being reworked so it’s always doable but may not always net a reward 
---
LOL.  Except, think about it:  this kind of recreational outrage can actually TANK companies.  Lose people their jobs.  Because a bunch of basement-dwelling weirdos have fun shitting on a video game?  I mean, what if Bethesda wasn't behind FO76, it was a smaller company; same game, same release, same bugs.  Would they have had the chance to weather the storm and release the patches and redeem themselves?
---
Probably not.
---
Then don't show player levels next to names?
---
Looks good. Im waiting till I get a bit higher level and Im gonna move my CAMP closer to a common area so when Player Vending becomes a thing, I can sell my stuff I scavenge.
---
Have 31 friends, 12 are online currently, zero in survival mode.
---
Actually, apexigod is a guy I deal with sometimes. My PSN is MeckieSoSweet and we're buds. See for yourself. No scam. You guys are dickheads, you know that? 
---
1. That's why providing feedback now is crucial.
---
2. That's an assertion.
---
My biggest issue is being a le to bring char from adventure. Meaning OP weapons w explosive double shot. They said they fixed weapons curve. Nope. Melee is also almost impossible in this mode. Doesn't matter what you got on and def perks. Those weapons will eat you
---
Where is it at?
---
Not the plans, but the mods themselves. You sometimes find them, or can buy them. Like the barbed cane mod. What does that do? Damage +10? ... damage +20? ???
---
It is the same exact game but open pvp, restricted fast traveling and you can't see anyone on the map but the top three longest living players and wanted players
---
Maybe, might need aome further testing. My legendaries havent been right since the festival. Remember how the sloth when dead would freeze in midair?
---
Well now the legendaries i do find have done this and i have to walk away and come back to collect. 
---
No, Xbox. Sorry. 
---
Oh man, and the added Super Mutant reaction voice lines.
---
I’m nit playing survival, because it doesn’t interest me.
---
But I always figured that since it was beta they were letting curtesy characters play so they can get a wider range of data to try and make better adjustments. 
---
I was talking about exactly this with some friends last night. Either make a “safe zone” or give some sort of invulnerability timer because spawn killing is a serious issue. They use the same spawn point too
---
There used to be a time when they didn’t release software before it was 100% bug free.
---
They could just program the bots to be unkillable and have them attack people who PVP in the stations
---
And that’s why your the Boss Man! 😂
---
That sort of tension can be really fun.  The old fight or flight adrenaline rush.  Glad you are enjoying yourselves because that's what gaming is for: entertainment.
---
I think you’re posting to the wrong thread buddy, trust me we all hate those free-loaders but this is more specifically about the legendary counter as it pertains to survival mode. Better to engage the community and see their experiences so you have a bigger sample size with which to extrapolate info from. 
---
My friends list is 0 I think the lack of a working launderette may have something to do with it, also I poison those close to me, not a good way to make friends ☠️ 
---
Dont limit it to only X items, just give it a reasonable weight capacity like 100 or 200, enough to hold a transactions worth of stuff, but not something a person would actually use as a 2nd bank.   I have handfuls of weapons id like to switch other characters, but i dont trust random people to help me.  
---
I don't think that's a problem. Just like in other survival games knowing how to sneak is important. It allows most players to sneak around rather than just give it to sneak builds. Of course they'll have the advantage in PVE and those sweet crits
---
It’s beta.  They logically have to test low level and high level toons to get anything right.   Then later if they so decide they can separate the modes, keep it the same or go for something in the middle.   I can see the arguments for all of it or even a suggested D3 type season(s).
---
survival lose everything,aid weapons ,armor when you die . true survival
---
If you don’t have anything kind to say, don’t make me feel worse by being a jerk.
---
Yeah no point in arguing idiots like you.
---
I don’t know about Fasnacht being permanent. But I would definitely like more events that people WANT to do together. I loved the community it built. Sure. Sometimes you’d get in the event and no one would want to talk and you’d get that high rank playing that autokilled the sloth. But usually the people in the event made it more fun. 
---
what if you have chameleon and are being as sneaky as possible to do some quest and because you haven't been engaging in the wholesale slaughter, you've lived the longest so a target gets placed right on top of you wherever you go?
---
Does that happen in real life?
---
I like the added tension of the Survival beta. I've had a few encounters where we both kept our guns down and even traded once or twice.
---
The very second I've been alive the longest I'm hunted down. You could argue that I should just be using my low lvl boi in adventure mode but, ALL of the promotion about the Survival beta says you can quest and adventure *just* like in adventure mode.
---
Which is ultimately untrue.
---
I like the pvp everywhere tension, I like wondering if every encounter is going to end bad or good, what I don't like is being punished for playing the game the way Bgs said we could play.
---
Ultimately this is a **beta** and instead of accepting everything that is thrown at us and allowing them to make a full release of griefer hell, we should be making constructive comments as to how it could be bettered.
---
I'd like there to be more detrimental effects to diseases, hunger, thirst, death by hunger or thirst would be great. perhaps even make us have to rest occasionally or we lose a chunk of max ap.
---
What I want is a *Survival* mode not a **deathmatch** mode.
---
You can definitely get killed before level 5. I feel like something with it is bugged. I was level 3 and made top 3. I got killed by a guy thinking I couldn't. Something either went wrong or was working as intended. No idea which lol
---
I agree.  It's pretty depressing to go to Helvetia now.  They couldn't even leave the decorations up.
---
They don't need to run it hourly like they did in the past, but they need more events like this.  Ones where a decent portion of the server shows up in the hopes of getting something unique or useful, or just because it's fun to hang out and shoot things together.  The only events that have a similar quality are Scorched Earth and to a lesser extent, One Violent Night.
---
But you said you only met him last night on discord? MAD CAPS!!!!!!
---
The legendary is worthless imo. All of them are which is sad, the only cool thing is they are named. 
---
Every aid. Even magazines.
---
Anything in the aid tab can be lost.
---
I have been predominantly selling them. But, some of them sound pretty cool. And I found some guy selling some of the coolest sounding power armor mods (in watoga) that are crazy expensive, but I have no clue what they actually. There must be some way to see what they are before buying them. Maybe someone has documented them here on Reddit? (tried searching, but no luck)
---
This my friend is a lie
---
Have you played a Bethesda game before? Oh for the love of Adam they are filled to the brime with bugs that NEVER get fix.
---
But thats them
---
I like really rare stuff too, but nearly half the masks (the coolest looking ones) were basically unattainable in a timed event, which is not a great plan of action.  
---
This has been the case since Patch 6, they nerfed it .. it's funny how they making the grind harder and harder with each patch, they really don't want people have any fun and have the slighest gain .. I don't bother going to white spring often any more ..
---
If it's under your aid column you can lose it.
---
Yea I dont trust it at all... Just asking for you to get your shit stolen. 
---
&gt;So I've been changing my builds around
---
So glad this isn't another post about the game needing perk card decks.
---
FO3 and NV: limits your perks and fans like that
---
FO4: player can obtain every perk upgrade and players complain and want unique builds again
---
FO76: limits your perks with great reason considering this is an online game, and fans want to be masters of everything again 
---
You could use ith contents to rub all over body and blend in with ghouls.
---
I did notice I'm having spoiled meat in my inv more often, but I'm pretty bad at keeping track so I figured it was just me
---
Because nearly half the masks, the coolest looking ones, were basically unattainable.  If it had been 1 rather than 5 it would have been less of an annoyance.  
---
I don't see how that would make any difference? Plus level showing or not the vault suit and one piece of leather armor is a giveaway.
---
Good luck, on PC for haven't seen them.  I've tried server hoping, and I check every time i'm in the area.  No luck, I had a good friend give me the x-01 jetpack mod.
---
Should have been implemented on release, so bloody obvious.
---
I love FO76 so much, but sometimes I wonder if Bethesda are not asleep at the wheel.
---
In all fairness he did say 6-8 hours those extra 2 hours could make or break his experience 🤣
---
I mean, yea, no kidding.. but, if someone wants to stay on top of the leaderboard for whatever reason, then they will do what they need to do. 
---
For me those are the rarest to get only got 3 initiate, 1 Knight, and 1 CPT.  With time you will start to get them and those are from doing hundreds of turn ins. 
---
I mean, 1. its been 24 hours lol and 2. fully knowing you can lose aid items why carry that much? You have equal opportunity to do exactly what he did and be better geared, especially at your level. It sounds like better planning is needed not removing stuff bc you died
---
If you search ebay you’ll see some people are still selling huge and very comprehensive inventory including rare and highly duped items. Bethesda employees possibly. Can’t believe others still can stockpile and sell after the carpet ban and deletes. 
---
It’s the full game. But beware, everyone is still getting used to the novelty of being able to go around killing. So all players you meet will shoot on sight, and many camp spawns. 
---
MAD CAPS!
---
Sounds like you thought being high level was going to make you good at pvp. You went out n cocky and came out humbled. Lesson learned.
---
No, it's one time application.
---
I agree. And you say they were paying large amounts of caps for this, but duppers didn't worry about that. They just dupped more nuka colas and drank them if they were low on caps
---
Yeah, I only really wanted the skull one, while I do tend to be a completionist I would have been happy just ot get that one because I know I would have worn it a lot.
---
It gives an option. For whatever reason people are acting like bethesda is somehow forcing them to play this new mode.
---
You’ve got the wrong idea. None of that happens unless you make continuous bad decisions. Come run with me sometime and you’ll see how fun it can get
---
Id have been all for graciously losing. Im a bit casual in a PvP sense, and only having a job and family makes me "casual" in every other, otherwise i wouldnt consider myself just a casual player. With that being said, i am not a sore loser and as stated before would have lost graciously had i been given the chance to fight, and got bested. That i could respect. I cant respect someone killing me repeatedly at the only location i was able to respawn. 
---
I was on the leaderboard for living long and i knew it was only a matter of time. I didnt realize i was so close to a train station when the fucker killed me. As soon as i respawned, he was already there waiting. Then the repeated onslaught happened. Only once my friend came round to distract him was i able to spawn in and put up some sort of fight. I was able to get him at least once, if not twice. But once there was two of us and he knew his cheap tactic would no longer work, he noped right out of there. Not respectable behaviour to say the least. 
---
I know all is fair in love and war, but have some dignity when attacking someone. Unless youre specifically sniping, dont just shoot me in the back.
---
Sounds like you should remember to hit the stash then 
---
Another question to all:  Even if all aid items can be lost, does the RNG favor stims and water still?  Or not?
---
*a separate shared stash
---
Just sharing the original would be a nightmare having to split 800 weight with potentially 5 characters 
---
Wow! want want want :D 
---
Level 70 atm
---
Whoever thought going into a survival server at level 10 was a good idea needs some sense knocked into them because that's just poor decision making.
---
Camo 
---
Another thing I've noticed and my friends have told me this and its happened to me yesterday. Some players will trade stims for 1 - 5c with you and sell you a shit ton, kill you and take their stimpaks back. Fucking assholes. 
---
Running bloodied in survival has been very unforgiving!
---
So, is this bundle an USA thing only, or PC only? It doesn’t show up for me on the Atomic Shop. 
---
You have the plague walker mutation. 
---
thank u sir..so i guess i need to continue scrapping combat armor
---
Display and storage!  I have so many I just can't let them go :)
---
I don't know how you can claim such a thing.  I'm not saying that you are wrong for sure, but I would imagine that you are.  Anyone who spent any time doing the event saw the rare masks on the robuts.  I enjoyed the event, and I'm not mad about the rarity, I just think it was a dumb choice that was quite clearly going to lead to people being disappointed, and for no real reason.
---
Other games with higher requirements may also be better optimized, and therefore not overheat as much. 
---
Part of me wishes I owned full assassin/sentinel so I could go on survival to swoop in and protect innocents without much risk to myself. I agree though, my best experience with survival yesterday was when someone 30 levels over me invited me on to their team and helped me do events. It means a lot more when everyone else is more likely to attack you than ignore you.
---
They could make it so One Violent Night rewards the new boozes sometimes and it would make it a community event. More people would rush to it for the chance at a tick blood tequila or Nukashine.
---
You only lost so much aid because you obviously didn't stash any.. you lost 2000 caps because you built a big base advertising your location and then did nothing until you'd been on the map the longest 🤦 you essentially paid another player 2000 caps to kill you while you watched. Maybe stick to adventure mode and leave survival to the people who enjoy it?? 👍
---
As someone who had tested games in the past, such as Closed Beta 1 (basically late alpha) of Star Wars Galaxies, I was very much surprised to hear and see how Bethesda planned to do their B.E.T.A. program. 
---
I expected: E3 Announcement of 76 with its opening to Pre-Orders. Beginning of next month (so basically a month after E3), the beginning of B.E.T.A. to begin stress testing, massive bug fixing, QoL improvements, balancing of weapons/armor/perks/mobs, quest improvements, fixing the *amazing* amount of map related errors of terrain, buildings, etc (most of which are not fixed since I started on Dec 4th).   
---
This would be more akin to a Closed Beta, where server crashes weren't just expected, but guaranteed to happen, regularly. In Beta 1 of SWG, the server testing sessions happened on the weekends, with an announced time to meet in a "launcher" with a chatroom where the Devs would quickly explain their goals. They'd start the server, we'd all join (probably 100 of us initialy) outside of Mos Eisley and, generally, the server immediately crash. lol That, was the end of that weekend's testing! They'd analyse the collected data, bug fix during the week, announce a new meeting time for the weekend. Rinse. Repeat.
---
Eventually we made it to Closed Beta 2, and by that point the server would handle the influx of players joining and we could run around for awhile, interacting with stuff, usually for about 30mins before someone interacted with something that caused a crash lol However, sometimes they would fire it back up again for us, or schedule another test for Sunday. Rinse. Repeat.
---
Then came Opened Beta, which was the *real* stress testing of the servers and making sure all the actual gameplay systems were up and running, getting players to run through all the quests they could to make sure scripting operated as needed, and improve on the balance of stuff since they had a much greater sample size. Obviously plenty of bugs still, but nothing game-breaking (or server crashing) like before. 
---
To me, it seems like Closed Beta 1 and 2 happened in-house with what feels like only could've been 20 people, as there just weren't enough eyes to spot all the issues and hammer out proper balance of items. During my time in SWG and even WoW (wasn't in any Betas for it), I can't say I ever encountered terrain, building, foliage, etc anomalies like with 76, and even FO4, but atleast in there I had Console access and could easily delete additional textures or shift the LoD texture's placement to fix the Z-Fighting. 
---
Regardless, in other words, they needed to start B.E.T.A. at least a month earlier than they did, but no character data carry-over from their period. Which they could've done it by pre-order date to make it so they limited the player count, to not be swarmed with Bug Reports. 
---
THEN should've come the B.E.T.A. that we actually experienced (well, not me, I couldn't afford the bandwidth to participate in all the massive downloads), which would've been Open Beta, aka Final Fit and Finish. By this point the majority of major bugs with server and client would've been worked out, quest snafus eliminated, map errors found and taken care of. This primarily is where performance is the main focus, for both the servers (due to far higher loads) and also the huge variety of system configurations being used to play it (ie, mainly PC focused). Like for me, generally, the game ran and looked fine in December, but subsequent patches induced some pretty big issues (I couldn't visit Charleston for a couple months w/o the game stalling out for multiple minutes before eventually recovering), and about 3 patches ago the distant-shadows from Ambient Occlusion --at a range of about from Watoga High School to the apartment complex-- that are overlapping and cause darker-lighter banding... I don't know if it's an older Radeon related thing (R9 390 8GB) or if it happens to all Radeon cards and Bethesda does their dev work on nVidia hardware (I know they announced teaming up with AMD but that doesn't mean their dev systems were changed over heh). Just weird things that I don't understand how it wasn't experienced on their end. According to their performance profiling file in the main dir (VendorSettings.json), the R9 390 defaults to "Ultra" graphics, and somehow my Ryzen 7 1700X OCed to 3.9Ghz with 16GB DDR4@3200 and that 8GB R9 390 isn't capable of Ultra at 1080p 60FPS. 
---
Long ramble-slash-rant aside... When they announced there'd pretty much only be 3 weeks of B.E.T.A. and only 2 of that for PC, I knew we were in for a bumpy ride! :P I mean I think we're just about out of what feels like "Open Beta" right now. I was having performance issues up until the previous patch (v1.1.0.8) and can now get a pretty solid 60fps in most areas (Harper's Ferry being the exception where it jumps around from high 30s to mid 50s), but I still think a lot of the issues here are thread related and improperly utilizing Ryzen CPU configurations. Just so long as things don't go backwards again, I'm content, as I'm now able to visit Charleston (as of 1.1.0.8) and would like to keep it that way! :D  
---
\[/ramble\]
---
Thank ya! I just think the damage from bloodied should be reduced against other players specifically, and not by much. Anti armor should also be rebalanced a bit too, and again, specifically towards other players, and also not by very much.
---
This is true. I don't have anyone to blame, but me. But still 90% aid loss on 3 deaths is well more than just "some". That's brutally excessive. 
---
it did once upon a time in my recollection... way back in the beta. We had so many three stars. It was truly a glorious time 
---
I’m literally the only person on my friendslist of about 100 people who plays this game. 
---
I think the Luck Stat most likely affects the rate at which legendaries appear. (both enemies and their drops). This concept has been in play in Fallout games since the beginning. If I recall correctly, the surest route to the OG Alien Blaster in early Fallout games was a high luck stat (increasing the frequency of random encounters like the crashed spaceship). I've anecdotally noticed a difference between my different characters who had low vs. high luck stats. There is a reason there are perks and buffs in the game for Luck... So before you open that door, maybe take a drink (with the correct perk card in play).
---
Reminds me that I just have to level my alt character
---
I have a jet pack mod. Asking 2500 for it because of how rare it is. I’ve only seen one in the bunker in all my time playing. 
---
I have no problem with it. 
---
I mean, When they said pvp restrictions were removed I just assumed the level 5 passive mode went with it or else someone could make a level 1 and just sit still and become number 1 and nobody could kill them.
---
I agree. If the game is fun, than that’s good.
---
Most will. I met 1 person who didnt instant agro and we parted ways no shots fired.
---
What rant? I'm just trying to see this from a broader perspective. If everyone now rolls a new character, everyone is on a level playing field, right?  But that doesn't stay that way, in 6 months, everyone will be level 200+, so anyone new joining the game will be in the same situation now.
---
Have a "fresh start" only benefits those who are there at the start. It won't be a level playing field for anyone who joins the game after the fresh start.
---
Fair point there. A set amount once players hit a certain level ought to be implemented.
---
If no one helps you out I can do them for 100 caps each when I get home from work at 415 est.   gt phishntrips
---
Yeah I agree. I nearly just had a heart attack when I went to go buy it in the shop just now. I think that's a good idea.
---
It isn’t Survival. It’s TSE One-Shot mode. These things are all fine and dandy but the current state of the mode after one day is fucked. They didn’t balance shit. They said you wouldn’t be able to be one-shotted… it was bullshit. We want a real Survival mode with real PvP. It’s just fucked at the moment. 
---
Remove the legendary affix. Problem solved. The affixes were a shit idea from day one. 
---
Yeah, I used to run around at 20% but since it takes two hits no matter what it seems now, I run around closer to 40-50% give that a try. 
---
Server stability wouldn't be worse if someone has 5+ characters thats more than 3000 storage this would reduce the amount of storage those people had so in theory that would improve stability as each account would have a maximum storage amount reducing the data the server was storing....3000 was a just an example.
---
yes, that is what I meant, Kinda like Diablo 2 did and I think diablo 3 as well, You have a main stash for you and a smaller one that is shared between accounts.
---
Not talking about Bethesda. But about 40 years ago during the prime of the first software.
---
I suspect, but really don't know, that the current one on one "my build is bigger than your build" frenzy that is going on right now will cool off a bit at some point, allowing folks to do events and such, especially if they're squad-ing up a bit. But for the next couple of weeks? I'm truly curious as to how many events and workshops get taken.
---
Well the game was a mess at launch, so a good portion of the backlash is warranted, and there are still a ton of bugs, annoying quirks, and severe balance issues, and I say this as someone who likes the game a lot.  If people just cared less about youtube hits and what youtube personalities have to say the rest wouldn't have occured.
---
My camp is literally clipped into a tree, stash box and camp device being the only things I have out all the time so I can dump and run if need be, i stay crouched and walking through the woods and thick brush, I have kept near perfect 270° awareness(cant be looking everywhere all the time) but the second I've been alive the longest someone sometimes just appears from nothing and beats the hell out of me.
---
I have no problem with the Pvp, I've even managed to kill one or two way higher lvls(my boi just hit lvl8!)
---
But this target they put on you for just questing and not dying is just aggravating.
---
Thanks, I think i'm going to need that luck!  I server hopped for weeks then just gave up. My only hope is finding someone who sells them i guess ;) 
---
&gt;I swear I'm five pounds lighter after that shit
---
The solution to this would be similar to World of Warcraft. Players can kill whoever they want but they should only be allowed to receive caps and the dropped loot if they are 10 levels between each other. This will encourage higher levels to kill each other and leave the lower levels to fight other lower levels. 
---
Also noticed the rates of deterioration for Hunger &amp; Thirst are much quicker.
---
Stop complaining man. If you’re a level 10, you probably shouldn’t be doing survival. If you decide you wanna do it, that’s awesome, you’re going to level up faster and you only lose 20 caps if you die. It’s still possible to take down higher level players if you still ge jump and vats crib them. Calling for a demotion? Good lord, relax
---
Travel to events nearby and stop going to stations 
---
Personally I keep my apparel sorted by weight, which always shows my chassis at the top. It still requires opening the pip boy but makes locating my PA a lot quicker. Of course, that doesn't help much if you have more than one PA, though you could combine it with the atom paint trick mentioned to help sort your PA's
---
Unless you are going in strictly for the enjoyment aspect of survival, I'd stay away from doing the main quest missions.  With restricted fast travel if you try to level normally (i.e. questing) you are essentially canceling out the 20% bonus xp. So far I think the best bet is to just grind locations/events in survival, while strategically placing your camp. The only thing I dislike is the longest alive leaderboard stat, as it actively discourages surviving. I end up having to die to mobs every 30 minutes so that way I stay off the map and people don't find my base/where I'm grinding.
---
To the OP, the ONLY difference between a level 50 and a level 200 are the available perk cards each has.  That's it.  All armor and weapons stop at level 50, it's not like the level 200 gets a damage bonus or anything.  If anything the level 200 players are at the disadvantage in PvP as they have more caps on the line.
---
Also, anyone using the argument "well a level 200 has a better chance of being max geared" is also invalid; there are a lot of 200+ players with level 50-60 alts and they simply move their gear over.
---
Player levels aren't the underlying issue, and having everyone roll new characters is a 2 week temporary fix at best.  Damage and damage resistance values/perks/calculations are what needs to be looked at instead.
---
Whitespring. Also it loses it’s appeal after minutes. 
---
Little Lamplight... When you hit level 15, we kick you out... :) LOL
---
Finally, someone with a head on their shoulders.
---
I'm with you, that mechanic needs to go. It doesn't change that using more realistic tactics is the best way to survive in survival. That and killing yourself once you're on the map. Being cautious when wandering around isn't exactly the fallout feel and it's definitely a departure from the standard Fallout formula. Im not too big a fan of it and adventuring in it isn't viable. Imagine doing the BoS quest while playing DayZ. It just doesn't work. 
---
That's just the clown mask, it was there at release.  
---
From what I could tell, they didn’t completely forget. However, they pretty much only added the few seconds of invulnerability in Vault 76 and forgot about the other train stations.
---
Because one shot wouldn’t kill me. The TSE will. Maths. 
---
I’d definitely be interested in checking out the gauss regardless of stars. What level is it?
---
There is no protection.  Beth just got lazy again and forgot to remove that message you get when u hit lvl 5. Everyone is spawn camping vault 76 to kill the new ones.
---
I love reading these war stories thanks for posting!! 
---
I have 6k caps saved to buy some stuff when it appears In the market so I can’t even play survival.
---
The quote does though. 
---
No one shot you through a tree. You got VATS hit as you were moving for cover. Complaining about a mechanic that has been ubiquitous through the past four releases in the franchise to bolster your hissy fit is cool though. 
---
Oh yes! sold lol, are you on 76 now? im sure i have the caps. Whats your PSN name?
---
Should have vaultboy/girl holding their nose as the "censored" blur
---
I think you realize I was taking a whack at the whiners who didn't really understand what they had asked for and got schooled in a good old fashioned ass whipping kind of way, then got online and started screaming for nerfs first day in.  I wasn't out to besmirch real PVP or first time PVE only players who only wanted what you did: An arena where everyone knows what can and will happen to them and wanted to give it a whirl.  The Quick and The Dead.  Today a lot of folks are just talking about the fun they had.  Fallout for Everyone.   
---
That sounds great, but after a week there would only be a handful of players left with gear, which they would redistribute to their friends, making it even less likely anyone joins.
---
That’s not the problem. 
---
PvP was actually decent before the new update. It required thought, builds, gear.
---
Now it’s whoever gets the most shots off with their auto/semi Handmade first.
---
The new combat system puts all weapons to damage a certain percentage of the enemy’s health.
---
Legendary guns don’t mean shit except for 25 percent faster fire rate.
---
Chameleon armor is the last line of defense keeping people from being melted by VATS builds, and even if VATS didn’t exist, people would still be melted in 2-3 hits.
---
1-2 mutations? Baloney. Everyone would pick marsupial and speed demon. That’s just a QOL downgrade.
---
Learn to read ;) Who said it makes you invencible? It just makes you take 75% less dmg from sentinel and then 45% of the rest less from the assassin's. Thats around 85% less dmg, not a 100% less. Know your facts and learn to read before you come at someone.
---
I made 9k last night on survival, pretty good money maker if you know how to fight
---
I feel you. I played in a randomly-gathered group (not my regular team), and they were kinda shooting everybody on sight, including the loaders, which for me took the fun out of the equation.
---
Maybe, although my luck is only 8 and I seem to find a lot of legendaries.
---
That's pretty sad to be honest because I don't want to play the same play style other players do because what is the fun in that?
---
op gear, believe it or not, takes a looooong time to accumulate. I have 400 hours on the game and play average 5 hours a day, and i've only obtained 2 sentinel assassin pieces and 4 explosive weapons. 
---
Show me where I said new characters are required?  There should be low level servers for low level players if that is how the player wants to approach this new game mode.  High level players can be grouped with other high level players and stop preying on the weak exclusively.  I do said nothing about resets, I think you just assumed what my argument was going to be and shit out your canned response.  Also, if there are low level servers, whether it's a seasoned veteran who wants a fresh start, or a completely new pmayer, whether it's today or a year from now, they'll still he grouped with other players of a similar level until they graduate to higher level servers.
---
I just used a strategy of loading in crouched to distract whoever was spawn killing, whilst my friend would sneak up and headshot snipe them. Lol
---
Also his name is Rurt Beynolds!
---
This is really funny because last night I was wandering around in there, and decided to make my alt's home down there. 
---
I would love to see metrics on how long people stay in the top 3, because I bet it is a revolving door
---
Yeah, I'd like a different survival mode that's more about the survival aspect and less about killing everyone.  Fewer resources, lowered ammo drop rates, scarce power armor, scarce legendaries, lower junk respawn rates, more serious illnesses, stronger monsters, longer grow times on things in camps, etc.  
---
Oh no, whitespring station, possibly the HIGHEST traffic area in survival mode, also where my camp is built? No way!
---
No legendary (or legendary does not apply to PVP only) would be a good one, really level the playing field.
---
Double your level
---
That... that has nothing to do with knowing how to read... why are you being an ass?
---
And no, that's not how it works. No effect in Fallout has ever worked that way.
---
you did well with the default plans. Simple and comfortable always wins the day.
---
Permanent no. Random yes. The note on Helvatia said the robots could decide to do it whenever, I would love it to be totally random.
---
I know, I have tried deodorant but no one loves me 😭
---
Okay?
---
Fast traveling to team really needs to be removed.  It makes team fights just endless wars of attrition.  
---
But think of how much weight you've now freed up! /S
---
I think plans for them can spawn in the corner building at the front of Harper's Ferry as well (near the fast travel marker), iirc I got the wetsuit and arms from there.
---
Would love to help Bethesda, and eventually all the players, test low level player Performance/mechanics but can’t get off the Vault 76 hill, new character just for this mode.  Started dropping everything and just trying to get to Whitesprings in underwear with only a machete for the mole rats.  Took me 2 hours, but finally made it to Flatwoods.  Quite a few disappointed “survivors” as I have no caps, no aid, now junk, only 1 weapon, some of them we even a bit vocal,   ut I had a lot of fun.  Tonight will try going West to get off the hill.
---
My plan is to find max sniper range to a station, then sit max sniper range past that and kill all the snipers.  Foolproof plan!
---
I kinda figured this place was as well based off the design of the area.
---
calm down, Goldilocks.
---
People keep asking for this, while there’s always ten people at Whitesprings amongst the dozen shops and full spread of crafting benches. 
---
(Suggestion) Survival Seasons. 
---
- A season starts on a fixed date and is active for a fixed period of time (one or two months, maybe shorter, maybe longer, but rather shorter).
---
- Only newly created characters may participate in an ongoing season and cannot swap game modes during that time. 
---
- After a season is over, the characters keep all of their loot and stats, but are converted to adventure-only. So nothing goes to waste.
---
- The top ranking players receive unique (cosmetic) rewards like Atoms, paint jobs or outfits.
---
- After a couple of days or a week, a new season starts and people may join again (as before, with a fresh character).
---
There is really no way to play the base game in any similar fashion to adventure mode because of the way the leaderboard works. 
---
This is genius.  
---
Rofl that time of quality is long gone. Not just software but hardware too, its like everything is done half assed anymore. I take it this is your first game your played by Bethesda? No skyrim or other fallouts? 
---
Look what ever your doing, do it qith a friend so if it crashes they can pick it up and give it to you.
---
Preach!  Upvote this like crazy.  The hidden thing would be my favorite part, like running into another player would be surprising and cool since the map is so large.  At the least, they make this an option on certain servers.  So if you choose to hide location, you go to a specific server.
---
like the chest in the player homes in ESO, our stash should be linked between characters, and it's balanced because now you are limited to 800 (ideally it would be raised) between *all* your characters
---
I picked up a mutation serum in a loot bag last night. 
---
Ye
---
yes
---
Yeah 
---
Exactly.  It's clearly a case of cognitive dissonance.  They are quite obviously trying to get a level playing field for themselves so they can get ahead of people who played before them as well as people who played after.  This selfishness disguised as charity makes me sick.  People are so delusional lol
---
Granted, I had read about what you said, as that was mentioned in the comments bellow. What I meant that I hadn't tested out was if PA could protect from a nuke, which in your second part you answered. So for the Pulowski Shelters, I was implying (or trying to heh) that it'd need to be coded/scripted as a safe-zone and then **would** protect players from a full-nuke. After the blast-wave passes, the air-raid sirens would stop, signaling the All Clear, at which point you would need to hastily exit the Shelter and jump in your PA. Again, this is all just a suggestion to Bethesda in-addition to, and with some alternation, that which the OP provided.
---
I think the ideal 'strategy' in that scenario would be to enter the Shelter, then moments before the nuke lands you place your PA just outside the door, *shut* the door to the Shelter to ride out the blast, which you then open up the shelter door. *(This is under the assumption that, while wearing your PA, you wouldn't fit in the Shelter; however, if you* ***do*** *fit, then just ride it out while wearing your PA inside the Shelter!)*
---
There is honestly nothing more "toxic" to the community than people complaining about a game mode that is entirely optional and was implemented in addition to the mode they are already playing. 
---
Does the no PVP damage until level 5 still apply? 
---
People are camping events and using the immunity granted as a way to attack others but remain immune to damage. 
---
Nope, necessary imo
---
I’ve noticed good with salt not as helpful now as well.
---
I can't remember if you can sell power armor chassis whole or not but I have one with a few mods plus jet pack I'll sell you 6k for the whole suit. 
---
Isn't that all scripted? Is it open-world ? I don't like heavily scripted games such as tomb rider and all that.
---
I didn't have a lot and didn't have room to stash it away but I was going to sell it anyways. The problem is that everyone has a different play style but for people, that isn't so big into PVP those are the ones I'm talking to. You can play the mode if you want because I am not forcing you but as a Veteran player myself. It isn't worth it and seeing the result of the downpour. If you like survival mode then play it but I'm just saying that it isn't worth it still regardless of your choice.
---
Same
---
different mods do different things. some add bleeding, others add anti armor. etc. the mods themselves do not cost resources to add, but may still need the perks required
---
How about making it permanently random?
---
God forbid they actually try and put similar rank players on the same PvP server or something.
---
there is no real "practicing" to this game, its grinding. when people put countless hours into a game that is arguably barely functionable as is they will be ahead of people that dont have that much time or dont play as often. then there is the fact that lots of these high tier weapons were either duped or bought for real world money. 
---
dont you think its a little unfair to people that just want a nice experience to get hit by lvl 200 deathsquads going around griefing everyone just because they have near infinite recourses and are able to craft million of bullets, fast travel anywhere with mad stacks of caps and the absolute best of the best suit of power armour that makes them nearly invincible.
---
put that up against johnny immersion that just got out the vault and built his camp in the hills at a nice spot that allows him to build up his farm, get some wood and steel to repair his hunting rifle he just found and possibly do a quest nearby to scrape together some caps and save up for a nice weapon eventually.
---
Double the cap drain, and every server has a spawn trap set up at train stations. Good luck.
---
I’ve noticed the containers in my go to areas have been empty for a lot longer than normal after looting.   Wasn’t sure but I guess it’s not just me.   However I have not done many ‘instances’, just general world containers. 
---
here's the patch notes, that give ALL of the info
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/62MOIbuwGb2pCFNuRKwYJo/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-26-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/62MOIbuwGb2pCFNuRKwYJo/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-26-2019)
---
I noticed that too, its a real pain when collecting flux.
---
I think they made some adjustments in prep for when the customizable backpacks are put in the game. I think refrigeration will be part of that. 
---
You're right, level differential is the main problem, and forcing everyone to make a new character is a temporary solution.  So why not just LEVEL LOCK THE SERVERS so low level people are pooled together and high level people are pooled together? That improves the current system, and it improves it for anyone starting out into the future.  Today or a a year from now, if you start a new character you'll still only get put in a server with similar levels to you.  I think this would help the situation immensely.  It seems the only possible argument against this concept is that high level people want to prey on helpless low level guys, and that's just not a good argument.
---
Good points. Honestly they only need to hotfix these three things and it would be a much better experience: 
---
1. Max cap loss level at 50 like you stated
---
2. Only show players with bounties on the map
---
3. increase the spawn protection time
---
Why don’t you just start a new character in survival? That way you don’t loose caps for your main character. 
---
"...but I'd like to take a moment to remind everyone that human meat is the most ethical meat, because only humans can communicate consent..."  
---
That's the hot take I want to hear
---
I'm over level 100 and never seen "Assassin's Sentinel" armor? is it a mod to existing armor? how do you get it - buy it? Just curious, I've seen posts about this armor for awhile and never read where you get it? 
---
I hate how there’s leaderboards. All it’s going to boil down to is people with god rolled assassins sentinel armor being at the top.
---
Be nice if they had some mini repeated games. The grind is all i have left really. And until I learn a new way to launch nukes faster (less resources and under 10) then i dont know. Once I can do the nukes again I'll gather flux. 
---
Wheres Preston Garvey when i need him. Never knew id miss the days of his quests
---
Should make it where you'll have to make a new character for both gamemodes 
---
Don't jump to conclusions and think that I was being high minded and thought I could take on the whole world. I tried playing survival mode two times because the balance damage was decent until I realize that fighting against a Level 190 is basically not balanced at all.
---
No you are, you just chose the right team
---
Thanks for the clarification, I thought it was some kind of special item
---
Should have zones with high level guard robots that attack bounty players in safe zones. That way if you really wanted to kill someone you can, but it'd be a very high risk. It'll help with the immersion too.
---
&gt; Dupers weren't just handing their gear out like candy, they were  charging exorbitant amounts of caps or cash for the things and their  ONLY audiences were people that happened to find them in places like the  trade sub. 
---
I don't think you're going to find much sympathy for that argument.
---
Like the logs on the computer terminals, plays some more of the lore. Assaultron plays why there's only a sinister robot inside the bunker...
---
Assassin's and Sentinel are legendary effects.
---
Unless the care bears take a workshop ;) 
---
I built my camp at the raider tower in southern Savage Divide I was #1 for three hours before I let anyone kill me LOL. So im #1 for the entire week leaderboard. 
---
Officially stopped playing last nite @ lvl 111 after I noticed they nerfed all of the sell prices.
---
only from treasures now
---
This I understand. The question is, how do I tell what the mod does before its added. Is it worth adding? Is it worth scrapping? Maybe selling? I understand the mechanics, its the details I am missing.
---
My shid is 5 pounds :o
---
The only reason I can see them doing this or thinking this was a good idea was so that they could funnel the bloodthirsty PvP-obsessed players into Survival while Adventure becomes PvE-focused.  
---
My plan is to play in areas where hopefully no one is, and when I find myself top 3, just Grenade myself.
---
People are just so impatient today. I would stop listening to the news or other sources of information accross the board if I were other people.
---
Speaking of mines, you could pull off some real fuckery in a single entrance building and being the top on the leaderboard.
---
Thanks for the reply. I just need the plans/ mods for the jetpack/ calibrated shocks for X01. I already have the power armour. 
---
I never accept team invites for this reason, people mostly just want to know where your camp is so they can go destroy it. Only time I will accept a team invite is if I am in a nuke zone and people want to get there else I don't. Also a lot of team invites are sent in error, I do it all the time by mistake.
---
Your right, it solves one problem.
---
It solves a problem...
---
" All these lvl 100+ chars popping shots at me, just watching me and hoping I would die to a monster or something."
---
I saw a level 4 get killed. Why you lying man.
---
I haven't seen them or heard of anyone seeing them 
---
So there are people who lost 9k caps. One of them may be me. Not sain i am noob, everyone can die you know. It is fast in this game :D
---
Do you got a link to that vid? I wanna see how that set looks from the other end of the gun.
---
Keep in mind, I have already heavily modded all my weapons. Suddenly I find a mod. Is it better than the one I already have? ... I don't know. Currently, to find out, I need to attach it, see what it does and if I don't like it, spend resources to put my original mod back. Seems like there should be a better way.
---
My only issue so far is the survival time leaderboard. I don't think they need another game mode, but as far as tweaks go to the current beta, I think they should specifically remove that leaderboard all together. 
---
I logged out of survival mode last night at my camp. When I logged into Survival this morning, I shot to the top of the survival leaderboard (~9 minutes) because everyone was engaging in PvP. Well, we all know what that means. All of the players immediately knew where I was and somehow got to me very quickly, killing me twice and destroyed my camp. Granted I only had a resource extractor down because I just moved my camp, but still very bothersome because I lost a couple of bobbleheads and some other nice aid items.
---
I literally only had time to look through my daily challenges, locate the new survival challenges for the unique weapon, kill a couple of high-level ghouls that spawn near my camp, and loot the location before about 5 level 100+ players were all over me. 
---
Also, I think VATS is broken towards player characters standing on roofs. I started a new character around a week and a half ago (Level 29) and he's a VATS character, so naturally I defaulted to trying to use VATS first. Zero targeting. Just the little click you get when there's nothing to lock-on to, even though there were clearly players shooting at me from a nearby roof in plain sight that killed me only moments later. 
---
I think this is the best solution I’ve read yet. 
---
Didnt notice that what do you mean?
---
So are you telling me I can just walk around with an anti-armor weapon and kill people just fine? I don’t need to be some bloodied 10% mess as a melee player to be viable?
---
Great suggestions, I played 5 hours straight and agree.  Also did you notice that it someone puts a bounty on you, you teammates can now do friendly fire damage to you (maybe bug) but also you get some of the bounty (team distribution).  So essentially, you kill someone take their caps, they place bounty, and your friends and you use that bounty to again take their caps.  Not sure how to fix but  it ain't right
---
I don't know, but that's a good question. I can only assume that you still gain atoms from leveling up in Survival.
---
My first hour in Survival Mode was better, more enjoyable experience than all 200+ hours in Adventure Mode.
---
My first 30 minutes were pretty boring, but after that I got marked on map and that is when things got interesting. When before I was relatively safe and had nothing to worry about other players, now I had to constantly check the surrounding. I was on my way to Watoga when I noticed other top player closing in. So I decided to take defensive position on top of the building near by and see what other top player is going to do. Not long till that player was running in my view. Took my sniper out and started shooting. My scope was all wrong. I needed medium range, but I had long range and enemy was already in range where I would use simple holo sight. I missed my first shot and second shot...player was looking confusing, trying to figure out where shot came, when my 3rd hit and killed him. 
---
Yea, it is positive experience and interesting for me as I was the winner in that scenario, but even if I wasn't (what I later wasn't), it would been still most interesting experience that I ever had in Adventure Mode. 
---
I like new survival mode the way it is, but i'd wish it would be more transparent or better ways to test things out, when it comes to gear. I mean when I shot the guy, he died on first shot from instigating sniper rifle. If he was geared as I was, I find it shouldn't happen. I expected him at least to survive the initial hit and then I expected to get upperhand and finish him of with Handmade, while him actually have some fighting chance to kill me.
---
Few posts ago I saw video where guy is getting constantly hit, hp goes 0, then getting his hp back to 50%. I'd like to know, what is actually happening in these situations, because when I don't know, then I can't also discuss with others on how game should be balanced. 
---
Yeah, just have to try and die less that you kill, I died quite alot, but managed to get at least one or 2 kills in before.
---
Please, do not listen to people saying Survival should require new character creation. Those of use who finally have a proper Adventure mode don't want those level 845 players with duped weapons back. Please, let them leave us and go play Survival where PvP is welcome. I think, the suggestion of level-tiered Survival servers is the way to go: levels 1-50, levels 51-100, levels 101-200, levels 200+. After PvP balance and player location visibility get fixed on Survival, I think, people will grow to like the freedom to move back and forth between the two modes.
---
It really should be. Or include the Bethesda plz list on the rules before posting when starting a thread. 
---
It's pretty scripted; although probably not as much as tomb raider. And it's a semi-open world. You go into different "levels" (large open areas) and you can either go straight to finishing it or dick around indefinitely. It actually works pretty well with the game and its story, although it can be frustrating when you want to go back but can't. 
---
Same here, launching nukes is too much effort for me, I might try it again. Challenges literally keep me busy 80% of the time. I rarely even bother with nuke zones unless I need flux which is rare now days .. it's a second job for me because it is so grindy
---
Fun fact!  Ever notice that sometime you spawn right on top of the mob, other times you get the 3 or 4 'areas' to search when you join the event... Well if you watch the event icon on the map, and the event icon is moving(just a bit on the map), its the actual mob and there is no searching required!  Join the event, kill the mob, done!
---
For example, used to make my caps off selling flux (flowers in nuke zones) gathered up 70 last nite, sold for 70 caps, total.
---
true survival -death lose everything- everyone seen - no safezone-
---
I'm not "big into PvP" so I am one of the people you're speaking to.. I went on with my teammate AFTER I'd done my vendor run and AFTER I made room in my stash.. not carrying all my aid allowed me to switch perks around to do more damage suited to the mode I was playing. I certainly didn't wait in the same spot with all my stuff in me until I had a big flashy number above my head telling the while server where to look if they wanted my caps. Don't start demanding needs and removals of weapons. You're just salty because you were unprepared and had you ass handed to you.
---
A bit harsh. Level 117 So I lose upon death 234 Caps.
---
Exactly my routine except I do it at the Overseer's camp or Flatwood vendor cash register. Can't claim originality on the Nukashine shenanigan though.  I got the idea from a post here the day after the update for this questline.  Still cracks me up though
---
Yeah wish people spoke of the other methods. But this isnt a safe place for that lol
---
Cleared the tank, +5 ap regen, +5 health regen for 10 minutes.
---
It doesnt work with alcohol at all. Pretty sure it was intentional since some of the recipes require hard items to craft. 
---
Yeah I would love that
---
That really pissed me off when i figured that out, why Bethesda why?
---
At least that isn't possible on console. Also do you use a mod to show dropped bags since they don't normally appear on the map? 
---
Its not like YOU were forced into playing it. I dont understand all the hate and disgust. Did you not read the patch notes? It just sounds like you didnt know what you were getting into and are upset it didnt benefit you in anyway. Maybe be more prepared next time?
---
Why did you not just make a new account as soon as you saw the name?
---
Oh I see people selling hats now. Other sell straight jackets. I sell produce and chems. Gives me something mind numbing to do
---
It's simple; don't carry aid items. A few foods, a few waters, that's really all you need. If you're really worried about your caps, then don't do Survival. Or just do it now and then.
---
That’s more what I was edging towards, it should be permanently in the pool of available events but it should be active at random points, sorry for not making that clear!
---
I think tracking kills would be a better solution to this mode. The people staying alive the longest would just encourage crafty people to build floating bases and wait it out.
---
It's pretty bad now. I used to be able to cook a bunch and play for a couple hours, now things are constantly decaying  way faster than before. Apparently the hunger mechanic wasnt annoying and pointless enough before. 
---
&gt;Even if all aid items can be lost, does the RNG favor stims and water still?  Or not?  Does it favor bigger stacks of items over smaller ones?
---
If its not in the patch notes, no one knows yet.
---
This right here is what makes "nice" players actually nice. They have equal freedom to be bad or nice, not like in Adventure Mode where only choice is to be nice. If everyone is nice, no one is nice.
---
I tried to use VATS, then he broke both of my arms lol. I'm constantly crouching and using VATS, but I always forget when I have a crit built up and just never use it. I need to work on that. I got right up on him with that shotgun though and it didn't make any difference. Don't underestimate the range of a shotty. The encounter I had before this, a dude two shotted me from the top of MT Blair with an explosive shotty when I was like a mile away.
---
Shhh. Don’t tell him not to carry all that stuff. My first 5 kills were like piñatas. 
---
Guy apologizes for killing someone in survival and you call him an asshole.  To the OP, Tucker Carlson has it right, never apologize to liberals.  :p
---
Can you just server swap to lose your position on the list?
---
I imagine that's intentional and then didn't want you walking up to enemies, getting spotted, crouching right under their nose and still getting the sneak attack bonus.
---
Not sure about the mechanics though. I have pretty bad stealth on my shotgun character (11 agi, 1 sneak) and Escape Artist seems to work well for the intended purpose, so I'd guess that they put a maximum sneak limit on it.
---
People were saying this long before it launched, and they did it anyways. It shouldn't even have to be said, it's clear it was going to be an issue.
---
It's like they have absolutely no idea what they're doing sometimes.
---
This post is everything I want in a post.
---
Zealots and 250 damage resistance while aiming if I recall correctly 
---
1. We are talking about Survival mode here. Players should be able to talk, trade and team up with other *in the same server*; so I'm not sure why you keep mentioning Adventure mode.
---
2. Have you heard about mics? Wonderful invention.
---
3. The fact that you are doing fine without perks and that set only proves my point. Balance needs to be looked at.
---
Google. I Google mods and theres a decently put together wiki about fo76 that has most of that info on it
---
Yeah I have been playing it using as realistic of tactics I know, its just frustrating that its being touted as a survival mode beta you can quest in when realistically speaking its deathmatch mode beta.
---
Not to mention the whole "invulnerable when you first arrive after fast traveling" thing doesn't work in the slightest.
---
The problem I have with it is it’s a prime target for nukes. Nothing like rounding up 10 players. 
---
I killed 4ppl got around 800caps from them, then this group appeared. They killed me so i lost 400, i killed them back and got only 73 caps from one, then they killed me again. Thats what i think is super stupid.
---
I’m thinking so, did uranium fever only got the one I put the finishing hit on. 
---
I love this spot but the damn scorchbeasts are mind numbing
---
I’m not but I can get on with remote play I believe. PSN is Josh87r 
---
Thanks for this! awesome work. I'm level 120 and this is still so helpful :D 
---
Yeah, I do. Flashing steadily like a reset clock is not Morse code, which is what mine is doing. If ops is doing something different, I need video to translate. 
---
Or you could grind. Like. Every intended. Then maybe you could actually see some drop. 
---
Nah, thats too easy tho.
---
 Just keep calling it pay2win because you haven’t bothered trading or grinding. Sound logic there. 
---
Does this challenge require the final hit as well?
---
Check windows event logs to see if the error was captured there.
---
You don’t need damage perks if you’re running a 15 str unarmed build. Except bloody mess just got the fun of it. I never use any. 
---
I ended in a battle with a lv 200, and we were mostly taking turns killing each other, but I was profiting, whilst he was losing 
---
I suppose some posts can be interpreted as such.  Was just trying to give a shout out to the folks who are actually giving it a chance and accepting whats there for now and still managing to have a good time.
---
Can I have your caps then?
---
On the road between Watoga and Abandoned Bog Town iirc. That whole highway has a tunnel running under it but most of it is narrow, this spot is not.
---
Thanks for the tip! I've been running around in weightless armor so my chameleon works. Cause even with my main set of armor, it doesn't make a difference. It's funny cause even though I show up on radar, people have the hardest time finding me when I'm invisible
---
Was too lazy to make another one
---
I know people were saying it before launch but it doesn't change that this is *supposedly* a beta and as such needs constructive feedback on what the player base wants from it **now** that it's out.
---
Turn off pacifist? 
---
Workshops are PvP triggers. If you have a workshop anyone can kill you anywhere on the map. 
---
No I do not. I'm quite sure they show up on PC. It may just be death spots though. It's little red marks with people's names on the map. 
---
Life pro tip: don't talk about things you don't know. If that isn't how it works then go ahead and prove it, I actually dare you :)
---
But simply assuming it won't be any different is just shooting ourselves in the foot so to speak.
---
I was behind the tree for a good couple of seconds but whatever. Either way, I don’t find the game fun in the slightest. If I wanted to play a game where the most exiting thing you do is eat, drink, sleep, and walk. I’d have brought the fucking sims. 
---
I put Cannibal on for a laugh. Keeping it.
---
These PvE players can’t handle being told the rules of the game. They complain for months on end about PvP in workshops even though there are legitimate ways to avoid PvP in adventure mode, then come troll every post about survival mode trying to compare their incessant bitchin to critiques of the game mode. 
---
The OP is obviously not a PvP player but his complaints do give the toxic PvE community an opportunity to act like they were right in complaining about workshop PvP. Nope y’all were still annoying af complaining about a game mechanic you had control over.
---
Honestly I haven't played survival yet so it's totally possible they added that feature. 
---
Got it. I haven't tried googling a specific mod by name. That makes a lot of sense now that you mention it.
---
Sounds awesome!
---
Just remember to duck
---
What does it get you? Leaderboards are pointless. 
---
Lol, first post says nothing about survival mode.  If I had know it was survival mode, I wouldn't have commented, as going into survival mode with pacifist mode on is as idiotic as assuming one's political views through one comment on a video game forum.
---
I disagree, if they make terrible decisions that nobody asked for nobody has any obligation to play it and provide constructive feedback. This isn't what people wanted and that was made clear numerous times leading up to launch.
---
The outrage is completely justified. 
---
Where were you trying to spawn in? In Adventure mode go to a less popular spot, and try to spawn in there. 
---
It's Survival, not Hoarder. Place your valuables in your stash before heading over there. 
---
I've run AWOL a handful of times (haven't been counting.  Less than 20).  I've had one additional legendary on two runs.
---
No, because that would mean me putting that filthy shit back in my Xbox. 🖕😌🖕
---
Wasnt that me? :D ps4?
---
Yeah some 100+ got me today like that I couldn't move and he blew me to hell. He took alt lvl 7 for a joy ride. I laughed me add off.
---
Awh, what a shame. Oh well, works for me, we probably don't want your whiny ass back on anyways 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
It's not about keeping the playing field level forever.  It's about removing the resources players not permanently banned accumulated via duping and cheating.  Bringing in those resources they should not have is the problem, new characters prevent that completely.
---
This conversation has nothing to do with what happens in a month and how players who play more have more.  It's about keeping the things people shouldn't have out of a mode entirely about how strong you are and how much aid you can accumulate and utilize regularly.
---
Touché! Treat it like an early episode of Sliders. Way better experience that way.
---
He said 10, not 50?
---
Possibly lol, was at whitesprings station, I was using a pump action, the guy was sniping 
---
Sounds like you picked the right team to me. 
---
Bags can de-spawn, bodies are there until server reset.
---
Well the mechanics in adventure mode would have made it just slap damage but I'll give you th3 benefit of the doubt and assume you didn't know that.
---
Are you or the people complaining about their fresh lvl 2s getting camped at vault 76 lying?
---
Popped on to take a quick pic.
---
https://ibb.co/tZD8Wh5
---
I said the exact thing yesterday and got fifty comments and downvoted to hell. It's a bad idea, alongside those terrible and POINTLESS  leaderboard things that force you to suicide yourself to escape being chased
---
You cut me deep, think I’m gonna kill myself now. 😢
---
Feedback is important regardless of how long the game mode has been out. I knew that losing my aid but what I didn't know was how much in total I was going to lose. 100+ items down to 61 Items within 4-3 defeats with a single hit by a level 190 player and I was planning everything out carefully and moved my base from the forest area to the savage divide to complete the first enclave mission. I wasn't interested in the PVP but I was ready just in case since I wanted to soak up the double bonus XP to level up my character. I didn't ask to be on the score broad just to be in first place and become an open target and my base wasn't easy to find either since it was hidden pretty well and if you wanted to find it then you had to get off the road and through rocks and trees. I didn't expect to lose a lot of items from my aids and especially a high-level player on top of that to attack out of nowhere and destroy my house within seconds even though I clearly had the advantage on him my character still lost due to him being a higher tier player with a full set of legendary weapons and gear. A majority already agrees that Survival mode should start fresh for everyone because how is it fair first of all for a low-level player against a higher level player? I had a decent amount of 400+ Resistance altogether but that didn't stop the high tier player from destroying my character with one single shot with a lever action rifle and a mole miner gauntlet and especially a two-shot explosive shotgun. It's foolish that some people are commenting on this post and find this as a joke but I'm not about jokes here. It wouldn't be a shocker if they themselves were those type of level 190 and yet wouldn't want to let that be known because they would be wrong. But like I said, this is a recommendation, feedback and also criticism and not to mention a heads up for those that don't know about the situation in survival mode. It's a good thing to warn others about it before they go through the same fate but it's foolish and wrong to try to cover up that warning or take it lightly as if it is nothing. You don't have to trust me or believe me but see for yourself and you would know why.
---
but why would there be weekly legendary challenges if there were no legendary effects
---
It's trash but still fun. I'm more understanding about the launch of Survival mode than the launch of the base game. And I fully expecting this. It's hard to balance a game with so many varying stat based items before seeing how the community uses and exploits said items.
---
This isnt farmsville and there is adventure mode. You dont have to play the competitive mode. If you cant make it in survival go to adventure and maybe someday you wont be a bum and will have something better to use then wishes to attack someone with. This is for the people who do grind the game. Obviously. And hopefully they dont listen to the filthy casuals and change it to some vanilla mode everyone gets bored of in 2 seconds
---
Try survival
---
It sounded fun but playing it is awful. 
---
Earlier I fast traveled to a train station whilst crouched and invisible, as soon as I loaded in I instantly died to someones explosive gun. Ok idk how he saw me, I didn’t move and was still invisible but maybe on his screen I wasn’t? So I respawned at a different train station, moved out of the area and went back into invisibility whilst I checked the map, a minute later I die again to another two shot explosive. And the guy who killed me was at the train station I just previously died at. How did he know where I went? How did I get seen through invisibility? 
---
The studio that Bethesda has working on this mainly had previous experience in Battle Royale games, so it explains why they are trying to completely change things to be more like what they like instead of more what the IP fan base wants.
---
would also be easier to see the blue box on the brown dirt than the brown bag. so many times i can't find the thing i dropped accidentally, and then somehow find it later.
---
I bet if you fast travel to the trainstation in the ash heap you won’t get head shotted. 
---
No. You just need a sentinel assassin setup or a chameleon piece, with a handmade of some type (probably suppressed)
---
Sneak build tears players.
---
No, you weren't. 
---
Feel free to add me. "phinfan007"
---
I never said that the outrage *isn't* justified.
---
I had to get rid of that the other day when I FINALLY got the Charleston traveling vendorbot but pissed him off with my plague walker. 
---
Typically, the way I look at it is if I enjoy the "beta" then I'll probbaly check out the game. I'm not going to hope they change X,Y or Z before launch, because generally what you see is what you get 
---

---
I was at sutton train station, cool anyway.
---
I just want the devs to do something about the rampant hacks. I’ve now run into three separate people bragging about it as they mow down everyone in survival.
---
Or survival without any legendaries. That'd be nice too. 
---
That's very interesting. I guess that's something they likely added for survival since players are getting more loot from deaths. 
---
K then m8, I know what happened, and it’s pure cancer on a disk. 
---
If you do no damage when they're standing still.. shoot them while they're moving. If you're getting hit with melee or a shotgun up close... Move further away. Just adapt and up your fight IQ. Everything has a weakness you can exploit.
---
I think this guy was throwing a tantrum because he sucks at survival
---
I'd love to be able to name our gear. Make it non-permanent so when it's traded or sold it goes back to basic, but I should be able to nickname my stuff for easier finding. Painting would be cool, too, but I'd rather be able to name stuff. 
---
Does hot keying work differently on console? I PC I have each weapon assigned it's own key and can just switch out on the fly. 
---
Hey there! We are aware and are still investigating this. We hope to have a fix soon!
---
A better solution would be separating servers by level, where you won't encounter anyone more than 5 or so levels above your own.
---
Then 50+ would be their own as well.
---
Just like the idea of bringing the lunch boxes as a throw back. Not sure, but I don’t think I have seen one since I started playing. 
---
just go to a weapon's work bench and before installing the mod you can see what it does, it should change weapon stats, and add a durability change before officially adding it. 
---
Yep, its a deathclaw eats giant ant world out there wastelander.
---
I built a Brotherhood checkpoint on top of there once, full of Mirelurks last I went down there. You've got a pretty spacious place down there though!
---
My story is from survival you fake news guy.  Shit  ain't that bad y'all are just being like ya normally are on this reddit.  Paranoid over everything.  Remember the fucking doomsday posts about the duped item ban a while back? 2.5k upvotes of morons lol.  
---
Campfire trick works again?! Maybe I should move my camp where I want it NOW.
---
It's one of the many tricks Bethesda has missed.
---
People want something better than a paper bag?  Sounds like a good excuse for the Atomic Shop to carry fancy bags and lunch boxes!
---
People want emotes for LOL or Sorry?  Let's add those instead of... "Hey do you want to PvP... but with a slightly different animation?"
---
Awesome thanks!
---
I did find current survival to be an odd choice.  It's kind of "king of the hill" pvp, since only the top 3 players are visible.  Also, bringing your adventure characters in seems like a bad move, since anyone who's not regularly victorious is just going to revert to survival when the hardcore twats who powerlevel and buy legendaries from the community for real cash are just going to scare anyone who doesn't want to turn the game into a job away.
---
You know, the Rust problem.  
---
Thanks.  I know about slap damage, and considering the CQC nature of one violent night, they might have reciprocated or perhaps damage OP beforehand.  We didn't have enough information at the time.  We do now, so we can leave it at that. 
---
If you're looking for an internet fight with your condescension, please look elsewhere.
---
If it were me, I would think about adding some points to luck for bloody mess or tormentor.
---
If you use 3 perks instead of the 9 it takes to get to 60% for your rifle perks, you’d still have 30% plus an additional 6 Special points to allocate elsewhere. You could use them for bloody mess 15% dmg increase and chance to explode into red paste as well as tormentor’s 15% chance to cripple a limb. Not sure which option is better.
---
Psh, just use them before you play survival. 
---
Yup! That's another killer tip!
---
One tip I can give, is play to the weapon your using, so for me It was a case of chameleon up, hide so i cant be vats found, and ambush people at close range, either that or pull out the lever and do a bit of chameleon sniping.
---
Possibly, but could be worked around.  I'm addmitedly borrowing from Ultima online, or at least what it was 10 years ago.
---
Carry weights and stash box limits mean your killer will likely not take everything you drop.
---
You could make it so that you can leave caps in your stash and only caps on you drop 
---
Player loot piles could be lootable by any player allowing teammates to help retrieve your stuff.
---
A karma system could replace or add to the leaderboard.  Initiate combat with lower level or positive karma players and your karma goes down.  Kill negative karma players or players who initiate combat with you and karma for up.  Karma below a certain level makes you show on map.
---
Not an answer to everything, but this is a beta and I think these are examples of steps that could be taken to help with balance as we move on.
---
I don't know why but some days I log into my camp and I have grass coming through some concrete foundation and some days I don't.  No rhyme or reason from what I can tell.
---
But the point is they're a guaranteed 3-star that you can often times just fast travel straight to. No searching for a 3-star. 
---
Yeah they should update the perk card text to list the exclusions (if alcohol is indeed excluded). 
---
Yes, but why play PvP then if you don't want to be #1?
---
LMAO the way the other player watches then backs away is great.
---
Found one yesterday at a static plan spawn location. 
---
Don't call people names if you're so peace loving.  Damn antifa.
---
On the plus side you can just sell the purified water and keep the flux for drinking now.
---
Then I misunderstood, sorry. 
---
Ok, this has been killing me. What benefit is an increased fall speed ? I just can’t figure it out. 
---
Interesting, so I won't need to apply the mod to see what it does. That's nice. Still very cumbersome, and it assumes you have the original thing that is being modded, but its better than nothing. 
---
But back when a **beta** actually meant a beta they would change things, sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse.  
---
Marketing nowadays has completely ruined the term beta. I still feel if Bethesda had waited 6 months to a year for official launch and brought in *real* beta testers to find bugs and stuff, this game would have been way better received on launch and instead of them taking six months to a year to put out the garbage fire they started they could have been bug testing and developing additional content.
---
gOoD ThInG It's a bEtA
---
They should just remove the cap reward for pvp altogether in both modes
---
It would be an intense stare-down for sure lol.
---
I've suggested that the amount of caps lost should be the same for everyone, since being a higher level doesn't necessarily mean you are harder to kill.
---
Okay,(: what’s your psn?
---
I also can confirm this is accurate. Zero spawn safety.
---
LOL.  Have a nice day.

---
If a low-level player can't fight against a higher level player then what is the point in survival mode? Fairness is very important.
---
Yeah I've done many many glassed cavern runs. The containers &amp; bodies reset on the 20-24 hour mark. I've server hopped a dozen times yesterday and today and paladin Taggerty is 100% empty except for her ID which only spawned on one run.
---
I know i messed up the title. 
---
Wow, that's really nice. Do you have build radius up on the highway, maybe for vending machines when that comes? 
---
I'm not interested in this discourse, sorry. There are 100 other threads about this. My post is how to deal with and have fun in the mode how it is today. If you don't have the right mindset (you don't), then you won't have fun with it. I recommend you avoid Survival if it upsets you this much. 
---
Hi. One big one that doesn't seem to get much notice is the huge bug when choosing to try another world when your camp cannot be placed. I've selected this at least 10 times on many occasions and 9/10 it returns you do the same world. Maybe it's an anti-hopping measure gone wrong. 
---
I dont think I'm a "try hard". I did find a ghoul with a two shot explosive assault rifle. Was I supposed to leave it there?
---
yep. pre-installation preview of stats. but the only way of knowing if it is worth it is to install and play around with it
---
*You've recovered from explosive diarrhea*
---
awesome. thanks. i'll add you and look out for you. I'm on all day (don't work Wednesdays)
---
Transparent lies are transparent. 
---
Oh, is *that* why I got so many friend invites over Fasnacht?  People just wanted to fast travel to me?
---
I wouldn't mind teaming more, but at the same time, it's hard to argue with Lone Wanderer's 20% damage reduction.  Inspirational doesn't really cut it.  I mean, yes, you could argue that you'll take less damage by virtue of there being another player, but that's only if you're actually traveling together.  In practice, I kind of go off and do my own thing half the time.
---
Yeah but it works on radshield and do you know the work it takes to get those items which are only available during a main quest mission
---
1. Beta’s don’t have to be shit. I’ve enjoyed many betas over the years. 
---
2. It’s only a beta to cover their ass. It’s probably not even a beta. 
---
I really and truly cannot grasp the madness of that leaderboard, it gives no tangible benefit that I can perceive except making you a giant god damn target. If being the longest alive gave you some sort of benefit, like every five minutes you got free XP or items or something, it'd be worth it. If it was instead an item that spawned somewhere, capture the flag style, and it generate resources as you kept it, makes sense. 
---
Making people trying to avoid the fuckkillslaughter zones a giant target doesn't exactly make them want to play, does it. 
---
Yeah, maybe if I could earn more money at higher level.   Can't even kill mobs faster the 1* bloodied grognacks axe I found at level 20 still one-shottef whitesprings ghouls just as much as my current weapon lol.   Even if you get a lot of high value items, can't sell em because of the vendor cap limits.  Makes no sense lol
---
I don't understand the problem. I played survival. Was camped to death, went back to adventure in about 15 minutes to avoid cancer. presto! like magic, I had fun again.
---
I enjoyed my visit. Thanks for setting it up!
---
I can see what you're saying, in that just hunting down players will eventually get you marked, whether you land a bounty, or are just good enough at killing that it lands you in the top 3. I do feel like that's a fair reason to be targeted by the whole server, though, and would spice up voluntary PvP. If you're killing players, it follows that you would want to continue doing so, and proving how long you could go per life should come with a bit of a risk, especially for stealthy characters. Even if there's no tangible reward, you still have people able to say they were able to bring down this many people before they died, and not some loose "2 or so hours" of "survival."
---
 I'm all for giving rewards in that context, though, as I feel that you would see a lot of shift as people died, and their number reset to 0. Maybe a weekly reward for placing in the top tier of players?
---
 I just feel like we need organically occurring PvP, and the game has missed that with every iteration, but this is so close it hurts. I just can't see a reason to force players to have to hold their ground in the middle of trying to listen to quest dialogue, just because they haven't been trying to fight anyone right then. It's like it's punishing you for trying to play the game in any other way than a death match.
---
Yeah, it’s been here all along
---
It gives you the notification that you can now PvP at lvl 5. But you can kick someone in the dick straight out of the vault, and you'll  be shotgunned in the face for your troubles.
---
Lol, you too :) I'm sure you're a wonderful person but I'm bored :P
---
I get it, my friend, bgs makes a lot of questionable choices on things and its been like this forever. It's all just coming out now that they've released a game that requires full-on attention as an MMO should have.
---
I have a lot of love for *some* things in this game
---
I have **a lot* of hate for some other things I'm this game. Ima middle of the road kinda guy so I know if it gets me in a lather, its definitely got others pissed.
---
Okay thank you so much :)

Hopefully he has the Hunters Longcoat for you aswell, its about 700/900 caps depending on ur CHR and hardbargain.

He also sells some clean variations of some outfits , Longshoreman outfit &amp; skiing purple &amp; skiing red outfits :)
---
Just build [around it](http://imgur.com/a/MPkaka5)
---
Personally I wonder if there should even be legendary items in survival.  
---
I can imagine that without them, it might actually be a fun game mode.
---
I think their efforts to prevent one shots are causing my shots to do zero damage, their hp goes down and shoots right back up again it’s very annoying
---
It’s so weird to see names so similar to actual places that I have been to. 
---
Great idea
---
Yes.... and people are giving feedback on what isn't working. Shouldn't a developer want that in a beta?
---
Ok, good to know. Got a few hundred hours and never seen it. lol
---
Yes, you can often find it at Raider vendors.
---
It's not particularly special... just kind of weird that it exists at all.
---
That is what. A "demo" use to be. I wish they had kept that term around 😑
---
Yeah people want to travel for free, so I don't mind in events .. first I look to see where the person is, if they already at the event then I won't accept, I had this one guy send me 3 invites at the Fasnacht event, eventually blocked him as I didn't accept the first two so why sent a 3rd. But if they a cross the map, I might accept, let them fast travel, give them a minute, then kick them .. I am a solo player so generally don't care for teaming up, but I don't mind helping people fast travel. I get some just want to team up and play, so depends if you looking to play with someone or not.
---
Thats awesome =D. Hold onto those.
---
Stay in adventure.

Crap suggestion.

Don't make a widesweeping statement against a type of playstyle because you don't like it, and act like yours is the one true way. What, are you the Templar of the Holy PVE, here to slaughter those monsterous Pagan PVPers

Right, your experience is everyone else’s experience. 
---
Probably that's why i haven't seen it before. 
---
You will be assimilated......
---
He’s the absolute definition of a bad player. Says he gets killed too much in survival so he tries to bully low levels in adventure and gets his ass handed to him 
---
Do events have no PvP in survival like they do in normal mode?
---
And the nukes.
---
I agree. For me survival mode isn't even primarily about PVP, it's about experiencing all that the game has to offer with the added tension of other players being a threat.
---
You know you are the first argument I've seen that makes a good argument why it should be survival only.
---
Well, no.
---
Fireproof.. Stays as it is. So the low level is not fireproof. Not so hard.  There has to be some benefit to being high level, perk cards are it.
---
I never suggested it be *exactly* the same. 
---
It affects anything in you aid tab. It does seem to be random. One time I died, lost 4 wood, and nothing else.
---
Yeah I know what you mean, but you're still just as likely to get a 1* wood leg from one as any other 3*
---
And power armor
---
My reply was addressing the "whoever though letting level 200s in" part of his title.  Players like to pick a large levels to compare themselves to when posting because comparing a level 10 to a level 50 loses the "I'm a victim" view real quick.
---
Even though anyone over 50, is level 50 as far as equipment, weapons, and usable perks are concerned.
---
Nope, but a stashbox can be used instead to carry purifiers inside. Seems to only be working with generic stash boxes though.
---
Not yet but will try that today and get back to you.
---
Yep ive done it before. I'm not saying its sensible. I'm just saying that's what Bethesda decided when they created the brewing stations. 
---
thats the thing though, this isnt an end game mode, its not made specifically for the high level players, why else would they give a +20% xp bonus? i get that this is supposed to be a risk reward type of thing, and a lot of people seem to agree that this and the other features like no showing up on maps is the true way this game should be played. dont get me wrong i have a mid-high level character, i just dont play him anymore because the stash limit is just a chokehold for hoarders and there isnt really much to do for me but grind, i prefer exploring and leveling up. so in anticipation for the survival mode i made a new character which i got to about level 12 before the update. starting from that lvl 12 i was having a lot of fun in the survival mode, i leveled up nice and quick, was always on my toes about potential enemies nearby, even had a friendly encounter with a player and we shared our experiences on the mode. but that feeling of danger that at any moment he could whip out a gun and turn that nice conversation hostile was great. its the sort of adrenaline rush you get in a game like DayZ when you meet a player that at any point can turn hostile and nick your shit. those are the interactions that make these social games good. fallout 76 has sadly not been able to achieve those levels before this update, with the update they got on the right track but allowed for griefing instead of suspenseful encounters.
---
Yours ain't any more than mine.  Ever consider that? 
---
Pretty sure it is. I do fucktons of events an haven't seen them anywhere else. 
---
I use the domes to nuka colas so I have some extra plans
---
My opinion since you didn’t ask for it 👀 is Bethesda wanted a way to drop items but not make it too obvious to other players, to give the bag dropper a fair chance of returning to their death location to retrieve the dropped loot.
---
I’ve
---
Obviously if someone finds the bag all well and good, they get a nice find.
---
Lunch boxes would deprive us of a fair chance to retrieve our stuff.
---
Yeah it's messed up, killed 7 mid-range players last night and made like 90 caps. Got killed by the same dude twice in a row and lost 600 caps. Exited out immediately. 
---
Yeah I definitely have all 3 notes and codes from the dead responders
---
Agreed...100%......this. DAYZ make me afraid to travel across the map. I would also say NO DAMN FAST TRAVEL
---
very very nice
---
Yeah. except the lemonade and hard lemonade, they are from the lemonade stand vendor 
---
I'm guessing more oversight than malicious radshield is an example. On a side note those do not work lol
---
I think that the only thing I really want, as someone who has no interest in what should really be called Suicidal Mode right now is the ability to choose a mode long-term and not have to pick every login. 
---
Let us set a "preferred mode" as either Adventure, Suicidal or Choose. 
---
Yeah I was looking at the luck perks, that's definitely a good option for me
---
Correct, which I reference several times, and suggest using as a new metric for the tracking system they've currently implemented.
---
I think it depends on what you’re carrying? Don’t quote me.
---
I got killed 3 times but all I lost was some food. I still had my 9 Stimpack when I Respawn
---
As some one who wants a more PvE server, I'm fine with that ;). Though I admit I kinda wanted to use survival every now and then as a, "you are now in an area with more dangerous enemies that you must sneak around." I don't necessarily want PvP, I just want there to be super dangerous enemies that I know I'm better off not being found by that I have to watch out for.
---
I'm of the mindset that you could quietly remove Mole Rats from the game - not just one, all of them - and nothing of value would be lost.
---
Their whole purpose in life is to A: be an annoying enemy the player *has* to deal with because they simply don't give up and B: to spread disease because it's next to impossible to avoid getting bit... and even when you do, the game thinks you got bit anyway.
---
Oh, and C: be that annoying enemy that fails to spawn at Workshops, so no one can take or defend a Workshop.
---
I dont really know. It seems like I can still jump as high with marsupial. 
---
They probably just put it in because lead is in the drink and lead is heavy. Still seems kinda strange though.
---
Because this was a 1990s problem that was fixed in gaming standards back then
---
Haha nice
---
Ground? I've seen dirt mounds pop up on top of metal see through elevated floors...lol They also seem to do more damage than any ghoul or scorch...ha! 
---
Im getting one shot in ful cav/Assassins while sprinting. 
---
War never changes.
---
Not lies or the truth, it’s my opinion. Fallout is (or was) my favourite gave franchise of all time. But I think fallout 76 is utter shit. After Skyrim, Bethesda stopped raising the bar. Fallout 4 was good. But it wasn’t  7 years worth of good. 
---
Makes me realise that no wonder Bethesda doesn’t want obsidian to make another fallout, because they would make Bethesda look like a bunch of muppets. 
---
Something must be bugged with it then, cause I stood there getting shot repeatedly by a high level and took no damage. Until I finally got bored and just completed the responder quest which finally took me to lvl 5 and he one shotted me the second I did, lol. But before that point, I was running around as an invincible god in 1st place.
---
I couldn't agree more. 
---
Hell, if they released this as an Early Access title, they probably wouldn't have to deal with half of the blowback they've received
---
Survival mode shouldnt even have legendary weapons.
---
Keep this absolute L of game design away from me.
---
Naked survival mode, knives only.
---
I’m pretty sure if they did lock it you would only be able to use the new character in survival and not be able to transfer
---
Even so i lost so many stimpacks, it is quite devastating 
---
Speaking of cannibal, they should let us search the corpse for meat. You know, for the cannibal on the go! 
---
They should have known that never works from all the other games that have tried and failed to implement it
---
Bethesda addressed the duping - there's no infinite resources, players have a cap on carry weight, if they had too much of a resource, they were banned.
---
Do you mean when you die? I was just thinking of when I am just trying to drop something to someone but that makes sense. I typically don’t see many people where I die unless I am doing an event. Then I don’t expect to get it back unless they are nice :)
---
well when the developers dont really listen to feedback on a pretty badly recieved game, then eventually add in something that the community has been asking for for months but implement it in such a way that it almost makes it worse is a pretty toxic move by bethesda
---
Well I figure it's either a.) Unintentional and this challenge is a lot harder and time consuming than they intended or b.) It's an intentional choice that purposefully bottlenecks players in full PvP mode to events and areas with known legendary spawns to maximize conflict similar to their choice to limit fast travel to train stations.
---
Thanks, you can clip roofing and floors through trees at the 3rd floor or higher.
---
Looks fantastic. Love it. 
---
That isn't how it works.
---
One player logged into the server at a time, the other 4 impose no "load" because their save files aren't loaded.
---
Depending on how tech savvy and Bethesda-game savvy you are, you'll have noticed the impact of this in other games in the FO or TES series. The longer you've played, the more stuff you've accumulated, the larger your save file gets and in turn, the longer it can take to load the world. I believe this was a really big issue for the PS3, causing corrupted saves in Skyrim if they got too large, as the system couldn't handle all the stuff. 
---
So while the sum of 5 characters with 800 stash storage space is greater than 1 character with 3000, the computational load on the server having to "deal with" a character that has a stash full of 3000 things is far higher than a single person logging in multiple times on different characters with an 800 stash size. 
---
Why? Because if everyone was afforded this same luxury of a joint 3000-size stash, then a server would end up with 24 players all having a 3000-size stash because we'd all make 5 characters even if we didn't use them :)
---
In other words, if a single player having a stash size of 3000 was within the server's performance, that's the size our stashes would be! lol  
---
Also, if "item counts" weren't an issue, they wouldn't have changed things as they recently had, making it where your character can only have X-amount of stuff on them, regardless of the weight factor. Once you're over-encumbered, the "penalty" doesn't change, so if you're going to have to walk to someplace to offload it, it's in your best interest to keep collecting anything and everything. Once you reach your destination, sell, scrap, and giveaway what you don't need.
---
However, people had mule accounts that they didn't play, were solely storage, and due to that, they would load that character up with thousands of items. They even purged people's inventories who had massive amounts of items (on the claim of 'duping', but I suspect due to the massive impact on the server performance when those characters joined). When a mule character could hold a near infinite amount of stuff, the stash size was irrelevant, thus, now characters also have a "stash limit" :P
---
Probably untended by the lazy devs who just put a RNG number .. some guy lost 95 stims with 2 kills.
---
Having only new characters would be pointless. Yes it would help people not having legendary but that would only work for what a week? Then new characters have duped guns and are lvl 100. Seems pointless to get rid of allowing peoples characters in. It would only do two things. Make the game mode less alive because I wont bother regrindint and neither would my friends. And it be the same thing a week after as  it is now. So it's pointless to complain about the character transfer.
---
That isn't a problem. It's unbalanced.
---
Why dont you just faem for sentinal Assassins? Plenty of people selling it here.
---
If your not dying in a rain of helfire and bullets then your not doing it right, 
---
As long as the cap ratio stays higher than when u started then u had a good run. 
---
I do wish however it was possible to get a perk to vats someone in chameleon armor lol
---
Sure! :)
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKoiwPyGSsc&amp;t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKoiwPyGSsc&amp;t=11s) 
---
Pretty much.  Survival meta right now to actually play the game and gain bonus xp: blueprint a death leap tower and just move your camp every 25-45 minutes.  It costs less caps than just waiting for the invisible TSE to the back you’ll get otherwise.
---
Probably, why do they keep messing up? They screwed up the fashnact event too
---
What lemonade stand vendor?
---
Sorry for asking, haven't played much lately.
---
I like to think the pipboy is just a very modern and efficient 3d printer
---
Idk I feel like the main part could be a little better than zealots but I’m still happy cause it’s my second explosive drop that I ever got 
---
You’re telling people to just hide. And use ‘nades. Yes, I expect to die, and I know what’s at stake, but this CANNOT be what Beth had in mind for Survival. 
---
Yeah I mean look what red dead did they dropped their online as a beta even though Rockstar games should full well know how to make an online game and everyone more or less forgave any mistakes they made.
---
It be the same thing a week later anyways. No lifers be level 100. Imo if they didnt allow characters to transfer over I wouldnt bother regrinding and neither would my friends. So the game mode would be less alive and for what? To delay lvl 100s with legendary weapons by like a week?
---
Yeah, I've seen them tunnel out of the roof of the covered area in Hemlock Holes, the bottom of train cars... and even when they fail to dig, you'll hear them trying again and again, unburrowing and burrowing.
---
So as a melee player without sentinel/assassin, will I need to stay with a bloodied build to compete? As I’ll probably be 1shotted anyways?
---
It must be bugged then, I swear, I have zero reason to make up a lie like that, I was def invincible until the second I hit lvl 5 after I finally got bored and just completed the quests. I was able to ne killed aftrr 5,  but at 4, I hung out in 1st place and watched high levels sit there and shoot me, I took no damage at all
---
No that's perfect! Please let that stay in!
---
If I could get a trusted team to consider murdering themselves for a bounty... Why the thought alone is amazing! 
---
Yes, you can I was below level 5 and killed multiple times. I didn’t try to fit back I just ran away and people still did full damage to me.
---
Tested Survival and made note of my Aid items before and after.  Before, I had 46 Stimpacks(3 Super, 26 Normal, 17 Diluted) and 87 Purified Water.  After 1 PK, I had 7 Stimpacks(1 Super, 6 Normal) and 8 Purified Water.
---
At least this was on a character I didn't care about,; however, they seriously need to adjust the amount of Aid items lost.
---
Thanks, but I already fixed the issue
---
Its a 100% find during a random encounter with ferals around a fresh grave. You loot the coffin and find it.
---
Has a wierd blank for a mod
---
It's a beta...this is the test.
---
I feel ya on that but the game mode is in beta, hopefully that along side the level gets fixed here soon 
---
Reason #1 not to accept invites to team from strangers... I get many use it to travel on the cheap but here is an example of someone who ruins it. You made the 100% right decision to not revive him, hope you blocked him as well.   
---
Unfortunately I think we'll see a lot like him come rolling back after they get their asses handed to them and they lose everything 
---
I'd say that describes most self-proclaimed "Raiders."
---
Hope so :o
---
Yes ! It was from a random encounter around a fresh grave. I thought it was cool.
---
If there are different leader boards, why merge them? Maybe the default needs to be changed because the average user isn't switching leader boards?
---
Ah thank you. Chasing those down was time consuming. 
---
It was ive only seen this encounter twice. And i walk everywhere
---
Would be nice if the perk cards really mattered. 
---
Added you :)
---
Ok, I can't get it to work, what's the trick? I've got my Stash and the water purifier just floats on top of it in red and wont place. 
---
I guess the fanbois have taken over this forum. Honest opinions of disappointed players not welcome and down-voted to oblivion.
---
Charisma is almost entirely team-based perks, though, no? Seems wasted on a solo build.
---
Its a random encounter, a robot with a lemonade stand. Sells "lemonade" and the recipes to make it and the hard lemonade version.
---
Oh god, randomly being in Cranberry Bog as a newspawn... I'm totally trying this.
---
I don't know about you, but I feel 10 lbs lighter.
---
So the "no death by PVP until level 5" doesn't apply in this survival mode I assume? So, a &gt;100 level player can just sit in stealth and farm every noob that comes along? Granted, not a ton of reward, but if you're stacking them like cord wood...
---
Just avoid camping school gates and you should be fine 😶
---
No I'm not and you shouldn't insult people for trying to help. It's broken now and probably will be awhile until it's fixed so take the fucking advice or dont. Just don't bitch about being killed when you can take steps to avoid it. 
---
I just want a normal wood staircase that sits against the wall and has a wall down from it. 
---
but it's like it's a bad joke 
---
I like that karma idea. Maybe not that specifically, but something like it so there is a reason to not simply attack everyone you see.
---
Totally unrelated note: Just died to a guy who, despite being at zero health and being shot repeatedly, wouldn't die. I am not very apt to say someone is cheating, but I can't figure out why it was happening. Like, I crit the guy in the head when he had no health and just didn't die. It was very strange.
---
Are they all 1*?
---
Agree. Remove the tags, add a “vague” area instead, but keep the boards—let the knowledge of somebody surviving for hours cause the hunters to scour the lands.
---
As for spawn-camping smarminess, vendor locales either need a non-aggro zone, or a bounty mechanic for camping 76/stations, imo. Something is lacking here; others probably have better solutions here than I.
---
My argument for removing the player’s tag on the map completely, is it makes hunting that player more of an event itself.
---
Grab Awareness, some Berry Mentats, a Recon scope, etc.. start playing the part. This, plus a vague detection radius instead of a direct tag, I think, would be better. More tense. More dramatic. And gives the defending party some semblance of a chance to survive another day.
---
What he said ^
---
Not permanently every hour. It could simply just appear at random every so often.
---
Or have more events like it that brings all the players together in the same fashion. 
---
Exactly. That's just too much.
---
Does jumping high in the sky and moving count? 
---
I don't even bother carrying any aid items. My character has healing factor, cannibal and lead belly soooo I can manage just fine. Maybe some berry mentats so I can see sneaking players but that's about it. 
---
if they are naked they may have berserker weapon, higher damager the less damage resistance they have.
---
I only carry 5 stims and no cola, inert flux and raw meat so they can't get rich off me! I literally stash anything of value and I do not pick up scrap.  I'm only in it for the xp boosts
---
Ask for a test. Releases it beta to test it. Complains that they’re testing it and it’s not fully working 1 day after it got released. Jfc
---
Good idea :o
---
I mean, the fact that they didn't seem to foresee the obvious issues with respawning at train stations in fixed positions kind of tells you everything you need to know.
---
But you knew this from Adventure Mode anyway.  There's a distinct sense that these devs either don't play their own game, or they play it in a way that's unlike how their players do.
---
T.S. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE?
---
Maybe it is just me, but it seems uneducated/newer/unskilled players are calling everything that has Explosive on it, a TSE. 
---
Hell, hit the LFG, "LOOKING TO BUY BLOODIED TSE." 
---
Ok there bud.
---
I’ve been having fun, although I’m about as deadly as a Raider Scaver. I’m down to zero caps (don’t need many caps lately) and will be joining back up tonight. 
---
Proof or didn't happen. But you dont have proof so....
---
Farming it is entirely RNG based. Someone could go an entire year without ever seeing a single Assassin/sent piece drop despite playing for several hours a day.
---
Trying to buy it off another player is also difficult. Prices for Assassin/sent pieces are very high and there's people now trying to sell them for RL money. It's only going to get worse since Survival is letting players get over 10,000 caps within hours.
---
I really hope that the Purveyor will let players have at least some control over what legendary stuff they can get.
---
I agree on the aesthetics, perhaps we could choose our preferred dropping container, I’d love to shit out steel dumpsters on death for the lols 😂 
---
I want the ability to pre-pack them. Get my level 10 armor together, some water, new guy plans. And another lunch box for higher levels. Stimpacks, alcohol, pie. It would make things easier
---
Haha 😂
---
Are you on xbox? I'm only looking for chest now but if I come across arms or legs I''ll mark you down and you can have them.   
---
Much like server hopping players trying to get the Nuka XO-1 paint people have been doing the same farming technical data as well as previous spawn spots.   
---
I stop by at least a dozen spots and they are either no longer spawning or being farmed excessively.   
---
If I already know a plan, I leave it unless I know for sure a friend is looking for it. 
---
I say make it the 3 with the most bounty on their heads and not show them on the map at all
---
you should lose everything ,caps,armor ,weapons. aid -real survival
---
Yesss running on an infinite fusion core.
---
Yes everyone involved in the event is invulnerable from each other until the event ends. Or you leave the boundary of the event
---
Sentinal armor and explosive weapons?  Honestly, what did you expect? Hugs?
---
&gt;Besides, I can head into Cyrodiil at minimum level if I wish... and Ima get stomped. As it should be. But I'm gonna get stomped because the high level players have maximized gear bonuses and skills...
---
Ok, then why is getting stomped in FO76 survival mode by a high level character not exactly the same thing?
---
I’m not complaint I’m down for loosing aid... BUT. I fought 1 guy and lost 90 Stimpaks. Only died once. My dumbass forgot to put aid in stash boxes even tho I knew. I guess I was cocky but I did loose a lot but at the same time I make like 300 Stimpaks on a daily so it’s not really a big deal for me lol
---
Isn't there a mod that does this? 
---
Ah, "random encounter". So I will probably never see it. It took me 2,5 months of playing to meet Grahm. 
---
bro, I know how to play games, I don't need your fucking "help", I didn't ask how to work around the issue, I stated that it IS AN ISSUE THAT SHOULDN'T EXIST, and for some fucking reason that I can't fathom you are defending spawn campers!!
---
You have your new mode that you can bring your God tiered character over to.
---
I am suggesting characters to start on a survival server and be locked onto that survival server.
---
 I have a pretty kick a** level 150 build but I would rather start over from scratch and just see how that plays out. 
---
Having to do all the missions over but with the added danger just seems a lot more fun to me than throwing everybody in a cage match and having them go at it.
---
Having high leveled characters start over on a new server mode is just a ridiculous idea. They have already finished every quest and nothing else to do but kill other players. That's what that new mode is for have at it!
---
The people who want survival exclusive characters because of people having gear are wanting the right thing for the wrong reason.
---
Survival exclusive characters force the player to gather his resources under the same threat of death as everyone else.
---
You are right that eventually players will get their god tier items but they will still need to farm junk to maintain it with repairs and ammo and in doing so will put themselves at the same risk as the people they kill. 
---
Right now "Survival" is just a glorified Deathmatch mode. Nobody can play the actual game because nobody needs to. They can just dump their entire arsenal of ammo into hunting other players and they never need to worry about the maintenance required to keep it up since they can just switch back to Adventure mode and refill their stock without having to worry about being temporarily disadvantaged. 
---
The reward for the supposed "harder" mode is way higher than the risk involved. This is bad game design.
---
Locking characters to the mode resolves this. It won't prevent people from getting murdered. It will cause the murderers to have to put in some real effort to keep up their murdering.
---
Tbh maybe it’s because of peoples shotgun camo not showing up. But idk just guessing lol 😂 
---
Hmm 🤔 that list would be interesting, I’m not home so can’t try but hitting ‘x’ brings up info on some items PC
---
No?
---
3 shots? I’d kill to die in 3 shots. I got fucking one-shotted all night. Then I got spawn killed for a good few minutes. Fuck Survival mode.
---
Did not know this. Thanks!
---
Do you have any spare berets? :x
---
What system do you play on?
---
I just played survival and got my ass owned by a guy in a black suit with a TSE Handmade and got forcefully fucked.
---
thats a very nice spot I also have my base there I made a type of military checkpoint and use the cave as a basement but its a pain to build it like I wanted but I hope that the build system will change with time and get better.
---
I had 77 Stimpaks with me, cause I couldn’t fit anymore in my stash and my friend wasn’t around to carry them for me. I lost 60 Stimpaks in two kills. They the third kill, I had lost all of them and only had 2 Super Stimpaks I picked up from someone’s loot bag.
---
Fair point—I have had more epic gunfights with 50-60 than my own 125+ range, so....you’re not wrong 😂 
---
I know it’s just a little thing and there are other more pertinent bugs to fix, but want to make sure it’s out there. Thanks!
---
There are a couple bugs with it so it's possible they took it down in relation to that. You're right it should go to Apr 2nd.
---
I said this waaaay back before the TSE nerf. Seems all the weapon/legendary nerfs so far are to balance pvp. Legendaries have no place in PVP, it does more then tip the odds in peoples favor. This is why i dont pvp in this game, i love pvp but this isnt a skill based pvp. Its who has the best shit wins, and if you didnt gear up with duped items your basically screwed.
---
Some times people post about it on the trading reddit. I'm on PC so if it pops up I can post about it, just depends if your PC also. xD
---
RIP
---
Ex military?
---
Exactly, stims aren't super common either
---
I wonder if the intestines drop randomly now like the other meats. Since we don't need them for a time limited event.
---
&gt;  that someone who starts recently has a null opportunity against other players Maybe the legendary ones in survival should be disabled.
---
This can never be fixed. People will always out grind you.
---
Now a balance pass in PVP to make one shots mostly impossible for sure, as well as fixing whatever the bug is with invulnerability on fast traveling to some stations.
---
But no amount of bug fixes will fix that most people do not understand the mechanics, perks, mutations, armor/gun combos and how they stack or work together etc.
---
It's depressing when a squad raids your camp destroys and takes 600 caps just by spawn killing you
---
Okay, I’ll add you when I get home. My time is pst 
---
Oops. I did not think to block him. But I will if I see him on a server again. 
---
I wish i could get this.
---
I've had to stick to around 60% health or it is always one shot. 
---
Not sure if its been said, but players using this paint-job turn that “pink/purple” color from some of the other players perspectives.
---
-6 charisma
---
with the power of friendship. i'm being so sincere when i'm saying i ran with a clan, and they prowled these forums looking for ppl selling them. And as I said before, we got them for extremely cheap, because at the time people assumed it was terrible, while everyone and their mother hunted for sentinel. 3 of the pieces were discovered by one of my clanmates who runs a charisma build, and he also runs almost every world event that he can. I literally have the most random of pieces of armor, with unyielding+vanguard on my character, as well as two of those pieces being level 40. So yeah, regardless of what you think, we legit would have 5 to 10 people farming gear for each other, helping each other with their pieces. I was the third in command, so I had dibs on cavalier pieces while the leader had his eyes on sents.
---
.....maybe Biv has a hangover.
---
Not that I don't think it would be useful - it's something I've wanted to have for a while - but *when* exactly will you have time to type words? 😋
---
Wow just wow that's a great response so contributing to the game 
---
I’ve got a 3* level 50 instigating revolutionary sword, a 1* level 45 vampire’s assaultron blade, and a 1* level 45 vampire’s shishkebab. 
---
Oh crap did I get it wrong?
---
Them being at zero health is just something you see. On his end he's just seeing his health stay the same or widdle down bit by bit. He's just immune to explosives. You can two it with two ranks into fire proof and a non-legendary chest piece with a dense mod.
---
You're unbalanced.
---
Man I really have no reason to play survival mode now. Nothing appealing about it.
---
Well they're moving aren't they?. (Aim is the right stick on consoles👍👍)
---
That’s very true, a beta is like asking for feedback on an idea before its fully implemented - which is a failed effort if that feedback isn’t at least responded to!
---
i went there last night to farm stimpacks and i ran into the Wendigo on the top floor. I engaged, shot at it twice and it literally disappeared
---
I'm not sure if you can block permanently a player in the game even via xbox. I think it's only per session... do you know? I'm not sure on this. 
---
I won’t lie. It does feel devastating to lose that many aid items. However, they aren’t hard to find if you have Pharma Farma or can craft blood packs and have the Super Duper perk.
---
I agree survival should be character locked and no legendary weapons or armor this would keep it difficult and balanced no gauss rifle shots from a TSE to the face or that poor guy I shot with my missile launcher 4 times (guided two shot ) who never saw it coming
---
The only reason you might not want dense is maybe because you want pneumatic on a melee build, but even then you probably want it
---
I'd play that
---
Should having a limited battery on the pipboy be part of “survival mode?” ;)
---
Can we just enjoy killing each other without caring about caps for five seconds? Take all your caps to an alt, who cares. You want road blocks in place to stop people from joining the server? That’s a dumb idea. 
---
Personally, I love gunning people down with my auto rifle build.
---
The words of your title ran together for me and I thought you wondered if "dirty magazines" drop in Survival.
---
The Lusty Assaultron Maid?  What buff does that give you? 
---
I’ve wanted to try that out, just never got around too it, a murdering bastard in his tighty-whities 👿

I’ve come in contact with 3 people(I’m only a level 7 and my buddy is a 17)
---
First guy jumped off a bridge and spayed us down before we could even react 
---
Second guy I was prepared for, I emptied a whole clip into him before he one tapped us both 
---
Third guy hit me twice with a sledge hammer
---
Nah I was just joking, as the game has a lot of oldies (me included)
---
How are you doing that pan flip and season animation? I've never seen it before.
---
If ur on a full team I think u would have to kill him 16 times to break even like what? Lol
---
Sorry to hear that problem persists for you, I haven't had a single wheel of death since patch 7.
---
But yes, I enjoy it. It is PvP, of course people should kill each other. 
---
Yes , But you can't say with 100% certainty that the GEAR was Earned or bought legitimately. With a new Character there is No second guessing it .. That would mean Weapon Dealers would have to start over as well in that Mode.  No one is saying players wont end up getting good gear .. what we are saying is it wont be as rampant and will hold Higher value and rarity as it should have been ..
---
 Duping flooded the market and now they are easily brought over to the survival mode ..  As I said in an Earlier Post the Duping Purge did not eradicate all the dupes .. It went after the big numbers .. but people with 10 to 20 never had there stuff touched .. now multiply that by how many people ? I'm low balling the number here , but The point stays the same .. They have a chance for a do over In Survival mode righ tnow,  they should take it. 
---
I'm on xbox and I woudl still love a text chat , I used to play ARK and loved that you could just type to the server for trades ect..
---
I love camps like this, great job!
---
Lmao, okay champ. Maybe you should stick with survival.
---
Maybe stay out of whitesprings? That place creeps me out anyways, but with all these raiders massing there these days it's a good idea just to stay away.
---
^^this^^
---
Gaming communities are total cancer. Reddit is pure cancer. In fact, the entire internet is basically cancer. 
---
The game is awesome. If people keep bitching, that means they keep playing, which means there's a reason to, which means its probably enjoyable. Just do the opposite of what Reddit does.
---
Yeah we do. Or at least try.
---
Lmao noone is defendiny spawn killers, and youre dense af for thinking that. Spawn killing is a problem presented and created by the players, all you have to do is not go to 76 or trainstations. Avoid them, there is nothing else you can do in an open world game with no initiative pvp. When i play survival, i find a spot i can spawn safely and hunt down spawn killers. If you cant play survival without only complaining, it might not be for you
---
Absolutely, I'm not pissed about the survival mode or even the bugs, not really, what irks me the most is no real answers from Bgs about much of anything.
---
Heck if I thought yelling at them directly would work I'd go to their offices and do it, I live like two hours away from them. 
---
What do you mean?
---
Its listed in Bethesda's big list of in the works.
---
I'm literally only doing it for the challenge and then leaving until they fix it.
---
Ron Perlman is a dickhead. I dead tired of listening to him in intros. Hope this was his last appearance. 
---
Coming from Conan Exiles before this game I love playing in a survival setting but this new server doesn’t feel that way at all. It forces the pvp too much, so you can’t actually play the game normally. For example if you’re alive for more than 30mins you’re going to have to give up any pve and wait for the onslaught.
---
Conan exiles had unrestricted pvp and it felt the way it should. Solo players built their bases in the most hidden locations to hide from other players while clans built massive fortresses taunting to be attacked. As a player you were constantly looking over your shoulder and carrying limited resources with you as you would drop all your armour and weapons when you died. This made the pvp more of a risk so you had to actually pick your battles rather than run about like headless chickens whacking everything.
---
Survival should just be the normal game without any pvp restrictions so you can still have that normal fallout experience of questing and not some massive TDM with leaderboards.
---
Oh shut up. 
---
Again it's beta.   Hopefully they are learning from their first mistakes with when they originally put Fallout 76 out.   1) Do a test run, have us play it.
---
2) Listen to the players, write down what we are asking for.
---
3) Shut down servers and work on the game.
---
4) Do another test run, have us play it.
---
5) Hopefully it is to our liking, and they just improve on it.
---
If you are on PC there are... mods... 
---
What platform are you on?
---
Maybe make the combine feature so the duplicates change to holographic cards! 
---
Just cause you can. No benefit but cooler looking
---
This game was designed to grief. Designed for hostile interactions. It was in their g3 release. The advertised nuking other peoples bases. If you dont like the grieving this game was never designed for you. The 20% xp does come into play with high level characters still too. When you have collected hoards of items the last things left to do is grieve people and get all the perk card
---
They werent trying to eliminate one shots, just reduce them. Its in the patch notes.
---
we are deep in a thread that is just the two of us, I am not trying to contribute to anything at this point, just incredibly baffled by your continued defense of spawn campers...
---
It was only once and it was a weird situation because the red name was a low level character and it felt like they were unsure about attacking at all! A third person joined and they started off the attacking which then lead to PvP. On a separate note it seemed like you get significantly more Halloween candy if other players join, I had around a thousand instead of the usual 200 per round from solo play.
---
I think you should be kicked from the survival server once you have zero caps. You can come in with no caps, kill someone once, then hop back to your mule to deposit the money. It’s a safe and easy way to make caps, and the only thing you lose is caps and durability on your armor and weapons.
---
I've had similar bug where I can't open vault boy. Try restarting the game? 
---
And now we're pushing anger-driven Socialism through American culture! Brilliant! 
---
If I'm not mistaking, weightless and assassins both take up the same legendary slot meaning you won't be able to have both.
---
no safezones- true survival
---
It’s the let’s cook together emote, looks like a frying pan. It was discounted recently 
---
Probably a bug. The alcohol damage bonus to ballistic and energy weapons doesn't work with heavy guns either. 
---
&gt;I mean, if you play a couple hours a day, assassin/sentinel/cavalier stuff is really not that hard to get.  I used to scrap that stuff regularly because I had too much of it ( now I save it to give away to others), and I've never exploited and only have 450 hours total.
---
I have been playing Since beta and have YET to get 3 star assassin/sentinel/cavalier  And I farm legendary's and events all the time. I have only gotten 4 exploding anything since day one. I don't wanna say you're bull shitting .. but what do I know .. I guess you run good ?.. 
---
What the fuck is your problem? I get the game isn't awful anymore, but it was. Even if you want to deny it and fanboy dick ride Bethesda 
---
A better solution would be a matchmaking algorithm that lumps similarly leveled players into a server.
---
It's not defense of spawn campers it's advice on how to deal with them until it's fixed. 
---
Because there is absolutely NO way that a character can play with a high level character in FO76.  The game isn't SOLELY PvP. Adopting a model like ESO would allow characters to play with, and level alongside other players in the game, allowing them an opportunity to explore and participate... and, as in ESO, a good player can stand their own in some PvP situations as well, assuming everything is equal. 
---
Look, it works in ESO. have to accept a duel request outside of Cyrodiil to PvP, automatic assumption of PvP in Cyrodiil (which results in Cyrodiil being a boring mash of the same meta builds, same gear, same skills, same same same… but that's another discussion).
---
My point being... we don't even have the PvE balance now, as high level characters in an area can screw the whole event for low level. characters.
---
At least, if survival mode adopted a more "ESO" approach, it would be slightly more palatable for low level players... at least they could do SOMETHING in the mode. I know you understand my point.
---
you're a fucking moron, like literally, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FIND WORKAROUNDS FOR POOR GAME DESIGN!  like seriously, wtf are you on about?  I know there are alternatives, but I literally shouldn't have to avoid a spawn location, period, end of story.
---
Honestly survival times are pretty high if you don't go out of your way to pick fights :p
---
It's just an inventory management system. You actually have that power armor chassis in your left front pocket. 
---
:} Suffer like the rest of us.
---
Bethesda just forgot to remove the message that pops up when you reach level 5 about PvP. In survival mode no one has invisibility. Even if you’re below level 5. 
---
Just a note you are hostile but dying is part of event without a cap penalty, I killed someone and got to wear the mask. There was no paper bag or cap reward (I’d actually prefer Survival mode with no reward for kills then the PvP might come more naturally!)
---
It's weird that they don't seem to be looking at the example of other GaaS games like Diablo or even the Division, which does allow going from PVE to PVP and back, but which never had the massive and game-destroying duping problem that FO76 had (has?). They really should have done an entire wipe and reset after duping was revealed to be a thing. I'm really hoping that the Nuclear Winter event will be that (although this is Bethesda that we're talking about, so probably not).
---
I agree. If they instituted some week-long themed event on a monthly basis, it would be rare enough that we would have the high turn out experienced during Fasnacht while adding new, albeit minimalistic, content.
---
I’d also like to add that legendaries should be removed and not drop and to balance the meta a bit. That way it can solely be build based. It’s not fun fighting a bunch of people with TSE or Bloodied Melee builds. Have legendaries drop in deathmatches. 
---
Well you didn't say three star.  That's another story.
---
i guess thats where we dissagree, fallout was once a game about adventure and exploring a post apocalyptic wasteland, uncovering stories and helping people. but i guess war, war never changes, but fallout does
---
Thanks friends! 
---
Exactly, which is why balance is a nightmare since there are so many variables. Its compounded bu the fact that we can get multiple effects on one piece of gear.  Some are useless, some are decent, and some allow you to be godmode.  Bethesda clearly didnt fully vet the legendary system in regards to PVP for 76.  Pandora’s box is already open for adventure mode, but survival is still in beta and can be adjusted.  Maybe disable legendaries, maybe disable some but not all, maybe allow players to choose 1 legendary mod per piece of gear to be active in survival.  Either way, something needs tk be done to curb the prevailing godmode builds we see now, its just too unbalanced in the current meta.
---
Flat Space Technology....shhh
---
PC
---
pulse mines + demo expert + your power armor = a bad time 
---
How much do you want for the lever action
---
You’d think sitting in somewhere on the other side of a load screen (like an elevator or mine entrance) would be the perfect spot. Kill em as soon as they start to spawn in. 
---
Yeah resistances might play a role too cuz I'm cutting it very close to death when I win a fight.  They might be dead but I'm at 2 hp lol
---
well thanks for the advice captain fucking obvious, gee, I wonder if I ever thought of that?  jog on...
---
It's not "just Adventure," though.  The consequences of death are pretty harsh.  You had a guy who lost 90 Stimpacks, for example.  That's on top of the cap penalty, junk, and other Aid items.
---
To me, the penalty is part of the problem.  Not only is it an exorbitant price to pay, especially since players in top gear are all-but-invulnerable to low-levels, but it also means low-levels are caught on a slippery slope.  They can't keep their HP up because they keep losing aid, they can't afford anything because they keep losing Caps, they can't even craft anything because their junk gets taken.  I mean, people had enough complaints with Scorchbeasts.  Imagine if the Scorchbeast instantly killed you and took all of this every time.  That doesn't seem like fun.
---
If it were no different from Adventure, it would probably be more appealing as a drop-in-drop-out mode that Bethesda seemed to be implying when they let you port characters between them.  Tired of fighting NPCs and want a more stressful variation where death is more frequent and unpredictable?
---
Do you know where to get plans for marine tactical helmet? Been searching the spawn but it never pops for me. I think they changed the spawn points after videos were put out. 
---
Just curious where you got yours or if anyone knows a vendor that has it. 
---
Assuming that the cream of the crop were actually chosen most of those folks have already passed on 25 years later and their kids are what we have left. 
---
The wastes of Appalachia are going to eat 40+ aged peeps like candy.
---
Basically what I am getting at is the kids of the cream of the crop doesn't mean their kids are. 
---
Also I am not convinced the members of vault 76 really were the cream of the crop
---
Facts are this is how it is and it isnt the best. So deal with it how it is now spawn somewhere else walk your happy ass across the map and kill the guy camping the spawn and walk away. Or swap servers its an easy fix. 
---
Yeah the sad lesson of playing games with grinding systems like this as an adult with a job: kids and unemployed will always be better than you. 
---
I mean, it's not working for me but ok. 
---
I thought my pants looked a little tighter the last time I put them on... I just thought I was getting over encumbered 
---
That's not the only idea in the post. I'd actually prefer caps to not even factor in the equation. As PvP exists now aid and chems don't matter because everyone does in 2-3 hits. Caps shouldn't even be a factor here 
---
Idiots don’t understand pvp so they wine. I literally killed a level 357 with my 120 yesterday lol. Ya boi can aim, and doesn’t have shit positioning, that’s all
---
Don't forget food. Fully half of the cooking xp I've gotten has to be mole rat chunks. 
---
And there is a bone hammer as well, saw it once a on a vendor run.
---
Also Enclave: We need to cut your toes off for an experiment you aren’t willing to do.
---
Mezzanine level of the ski resort gets my vote.
---
Hey Bethesda, could you kindly forward a problem to your devs i have found?
---
It seems to be connected to the way the game handles connections. Basically, my ISP changes my IP adress from time to time. Whenever that happens the game boots me with a "Your account has logged in from another device" message. This is SUPER annoying. This is also not a problem any other game faces. Please tell your programmers to think about using a standard instead of just seeing if an IP adress changes. 
---
Thank you in advance.
---
&gt;Because there is absolutely NO way that a character can play with a high level character in FO76
---
Except for Adventure mode.  The FO76 version of don't take your low level character to Cyrodiil.
---
&gt;Look, it works in ESO. have to accept a duel request outside of Cyrodiil to PvP
---
Just like Adventure mode.  Though we shoot each other once instead of a separate duel request mechanism.
---
&gt;I know you understand my point.
---
Nope.  It seems like everything you're asking for is already there, as long as you apply "Cyrodiil = Survival Mode".
---
hururrrrrrr dick riderrr huuurrururuurrrrr
---
Just the fact that everyone is being positive, and like a typical Reddit enthusiast, you have to come and shit all over it. Compliments can't even exist anymore because of jackasses like you. I'm sure Bernie would love you. 
---
And no, I'm not a Bethesda dick rider. I barely play the game. I just come to see people's creations. I do hate seeing some prick try to shit on everyone's well-deserved parade though for no reason other than to fulfill his own quota of insecurities. 
---
*world gets nuked and civilization as we know it is wiped from existence*
---
“Hey I got this handy 3D printer on my arm, I’m gonna kill everything I see”
---
stop trying to tell me how to play a game, the literal point, FOR THE LAST FUCKING TIME, is that I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS, FFS put the bong down or stay in school, cos you are one dumb motherfucker...
---
go out back of Watoga train station and head West down the tracks a little bit to the next box cars. go up the ramp and on the two stacked boxes is where the plans spawn. it may take u up to 2 weeks to get them but they’re consistently spawned there. go there everyday.
---
Don't a lot of snipers chew tobacco, since they can't smoke? 
---
I don’t play a lot of pvp games, but when I do I don’t remember ever being a bulletsponge. One shotgun blast up close or three or four bullets max and you’re dead.
---
I was gonna say the exact same thing. 
---
Sshhhh. The first rule of extra carryweight is you don't talk about extra carryweight.
---
Hopefully never, keep the cheaters out.
---
sometimes the plans spawn vertically and can be a little tricky to see.
---
I played survival mode for a few hours yesterday. Never came across another player. And it seemed like names rarely popped up in the kill feed. It felt like adventure mode with limited fast travel. Oh and the weekly legendary challenge appears to be bugged. I've killed a legendary mirelurk and deathclaw. Shows 0 kills in the challenge screen 
---
Agreed on the first point!
---
That’s great you live so close I’d love to go see their offices with all the life size Fallout gear you see in their videos.
---
Remap your ADS key and see if it works. 
---
Like I said in other replies... I not lying, it must have been bugged on that server, looks like a few people had the same experience as me, but most got killed vefore lvl 5, either way, I'm glad to hear that it isn't intended to work the way it did for me last night. I thought it was a total bethesda oversight, but I guess I was hust buggin
---
The better question is why can we only have one? Why not both?
---
Okay so look right there will always be spawn camping. Even if there is a safe zone people will wait outside of it. If the timer is extended they will follow and wait it out. There will always be a form of spawn camping. Instead of complaining do your best to kill the campers or move on.
---
This gave me a good chuckle at work. Thank you wastelander. I too look forward to eating you 
---
You're 100% right. I didn't even think about how damaging the dropping aid items mechanic could be to new characters. But I would still say that it isn't enough to distinguish it from Adventure. It gives PvP real consequences, but PvE is still so easy it doesn't factor there. 
---
 do not know. I have never used the feature. 
---
Link? 
---
Well even considering I Live that close I've still not done that 😆
---
Only a try-hard would defend themselves. If you use one weapon type only (TSE) you know who are. 
---
I guess it probably is an oversight bug, because even survival mode upon reaching level 5, you still get screen about engaging in PvP.
---
On console we have two options. A hot key and item wheel. The hot key is left on D-pad and only cycles back to the most recent weapon you use before the weapon you're currently using. There is no option to assign a weapon to it. The only way to do it would be to purposely equip a weapon you want to go to that hot key and use it, then switch back to your main weapon. The item wheel to me is slower and because of a bug that will remove items that have the same base name (in my case it's two different power fist, so one will be removed) I really don't like using it. The hot key is so much faster but it only allows you to cycle between two weapons, which I don't mind but I wish I could assign a weapon to it permanently instead of it just going to the last weapon used.
---
Really sounds like your game was bugged. What level where you and did you enjoy it?
---
Or at least a big damage / accuracy penalty for using it?
---
&gt;Please, do not listen to people saying Survival should require new character creation. Those of use who finally have a proper PvE pacifist Adventure mode don't want those level 845 players with duped weapons back
---
I disagree with you, Sorry, You think they wont come back to adventure mode with their lvl 845 Toon ? .. Ummm okay ?  Even if they did come back .. it will be harder for them to do anything to you anyways with what they are planning .. 
---
Yes that seems fair to be kicked when no caps. That and a caps cap for lvl50+. Good idea. 
---
Why don't you use a mic? PTT is in so it seems strange to me to not do it 
---
If a couple high level characters are using the leaderboard markers to hunt down the longest surviving players, doesn't it rapidly get to the point where those longest surviving players are themselves? Even if you do something find yourself in that top three, and don't want people to know where you are, you can just suicide by grenade or monster. Or maybe just embrace the fact that if you live long enough, raiders will come for you, and take your 1 death before going back to anonymity. Maybe you even take a few out before they get you and come out caps-positive.
---
Given Bethesda’s track record I would say it’s more likely an oversight.
---
Agreed. I really wish I could upvote this a hundred times. I would like this argument to be debated...
---
A bad experience you’ve had that hopefully leads to improvements at the end of beta. Let’s see, and if this isn’t resolved for go live then I will join you in complaining - I certainly won’t be playing it either at that point.
---
There is some logic to that.  If you're going to die frequently anyway, why bother with armor?
---
I wonder how high Berserkers can get.
---
Dude generic, you need to calm down before you blow a vein, youre seriously embarrassing yourself, your mom is prob so upset
---
The game was released nearly five months ago... how are there still this many bugs, or did you simply thought it be ok to continue working on a half baked game and make the community do QA for you?
---
No. Maybe next year. I am in board with a new weekly event. And a steady stream of new weekly events coming in roughly once a month or so.
---
That was never this game. You are playing the wrong game if you thought that thats what this game was like. The pvp, theres camp destroying, there was slap damage to make you engage. None of that sounds like helping others out. Its apocalyptic wasteland like you said. Thats not a happy helpful place
---
Maybe you should broaden your perspective and be open to discussion.  This is your response to anyone who is asking for any changes to the new mode.  It's a beta, there will be changes, and you'll have to accept them, so why not be part of the discussion instead of just throwing out the same bullshit "gitgud" responses over and over?  
---
What is your argument AGAINST low level, mid level, and high level servers?  Is it because that would make it... competitive?  Challenging?  God forbid you have to fight another high level player who might actually kill you instead of just hunting level 10 guys and spawncamping all day?  Pathetic.
---
I played and there was a kill every few seconds. Everyone was fighting in Whitesprings with no fear of losing caps or aid. 
---
From what I've seen you'd be hard pressed to buy a piece for the caps limit, most aren't even selling for caps, only other "God tier" gear. The people who duped will always be ahead. 
---
hahahah 
---
Survival mode should include needing to medicate , feed and drink. Along with forming Alliances to survive. 
---
Adventure mode should be the easy-going mode. 
---
And of course - PvP mode. 
---
Send me a Friend request and I'll look for you.  GT is xx Dinkles xx.  I play most days (1 am to 4 am GMT).  On Friday through Sunday I'm usually on from 2 pm to 8 pm GMT.  I have plenty to get you started.  Good luck.
---
WOW what an intelligent response. (Sarcasm because you are clearly stupid)
---
No, I'm not shitting everyone's parade and I even said the game is good now. All I said is it used to be bad. Saying it wasn't as bad as people made it out to be is a lie. I just started a fact that it WAS bad. Now it is okay. Also, it's the internet dude. If you get triggered that easily and can't handle a little criticism then don't go on the internet. Because everyone on the internet has opinions.
---
Spawn camping at least, they did try. The patch notes mention a cool down after spawning that just doesn’t work. I imagine they playtested this on their internal network where the cooldown worked. 
---
\&gt;unacceptable
---
pro-tip: every retail and customer service person, when they see or hear this word, will actively not want to help you.
---
I really hate the fact that we get shown on the map if we’ve been alive for too long as well.
---
Awesome! I’m on British time
---
how can someone camp a safe zone?  the whole reason spawn *points* get camped is because they are fixed points that are easy to control, if the area around the train station, lets say about half the size of a CAMP, were a safe zone then sure you could sit at the perimeter but who's to say where on the perimeter a player makes his entry/exit?  another thing a safe zone accomplishes is not getting shot while in the trade menu...  
---
u/ladydevann
---
More points to keep in mind here.
---
FO76 Beta wasn't beta it was the full fledged game.   
---
I carried over literally everything from the Beta to the 'released game'.
---
Xbox?
---
I'm still shitting on your dumb suggestion.  We are just busy enjoying the new mode not bitching on Reddit with these crybabies.  I'm at work now but as soon I get home it's back to survival.
---
Never a thing. However, I've almost sold something for 0 caps because I held down space for too long while initiating a trade. I'm guessing that's what happened. People are careless and get in a hurry and button mash. I've never dropped, scrapped, or sold something I didn't intend to because I take my time. Most people don't. That's not a slam on them, it's just the truth and a different play style. The interface is a little buggy in general and as a result it punishes people who hurry through things and don't make sure they are scrapping what they think they are scrapping. I've gotten crap before because I take a long time to do a trade but I am making darn sure I'm not giving anything away.
---
What the made is none of the things you are suggesting, it's more of a tag assassination style game node that never stops
---
That was it. I logged in again and was able to get in just fine.
---
No, it isn't. at level 4... I can do, let's say... 35 damage with a pistol. Maybe 50 with an axe. That's it. That's all. I can't even wield a better weapon even if I found it.
---
In ESO... we've got normalized damaged, around that 10K mark, be I level 2 or level 100. Then that damage is modified, according to my skills and gear bonuses. If we both walk into an area, we can both fight "Beastie #1". If we both wander into a delve, we can both hack our way through it... you'll probably have an easier time, but we can both get through it.
---
That isn't how it is in FO76.
---
Sorry for late reply - I truly have left FO76 for right now. I've logged in twice since this nerf. :/ 
---
Anyway - I did not have tank killer, I do have some luck perks, though by and large, I've used them for additional resources, and sometimes swap in those to repair my guns or armor. (I like getting additional meds which I use to make money by selling, etc. Ditto on meat from kills.)
---
I've been mostly running a jack of all trades. I'd have to log in to see my stats, but I believe my SPECIAL is something like.. oh hell, had to login to look it up. :) They are: 8, 11, 3, 9, 11, 9, 5. I can appreciate the shared perks - though with the game being what it is, we more often share perks to let us carry stuff than we do to make us more effective in combat.  (I also run a fair bit of health stuff - like maxing out my stimpaks and then ensuring that when I use them, they cure teammates around me too...)
---
I know my build isn't perfect, and that's kind of what irritates me about the nerf they implemented. They were focusing so much on these top-end folks, or the ones who were duping, that those of us who weren't and got caught up in it find it all just "too much."
---
Heck, I even love events in games (I'm doing the Jester thing in ESO right now..) and I couldn't bring myself to even check out the new/first even in FO76, because this nerf just sucked the enjoyment out of the game for me.
---
Because (a) random aid items was nearly all my aid items after 2 deaths, and (b) death upon spawning is a bug that needs to be fixed. 
---
That's a deep analysis Sigmund.
---
Also, if that's how they want to play then good for them. Explosive expert is a build type. And one that's pretty easy to counter. 
---
Wash the sand out of your vagina and practice a little. 
---
I also played a lot more at release.  Maybe rates dropped since then?  I'm not a big item farmer, I have more fun building/helping out, so I'm admittedly not into the current lingo on it, so if three star was implied, that's something I did not know.
---
I meant just getting those as drops with any star value...sorry.  And honestly who'd want to risk their best gear in PVP?  Maybe you're right about exploiters.  But how do you know they're wearing three star gear?  From my understanding, survival doesn't drop equipment currently does it?  And as far as I know there's no way to see someone's equipment currently.  So short of them telling you that, is there a visual effect on three star stuff? (Just asking for my own personal knowledge.)
---
PS: Please don't downvote me above for not knowing you meant three star, that's not fair. :/
---
Oh damn I forgot all about her! They should add her in!
---
Yeah I was afraid of that 
---
Wait for sheepsquatch update april 9th I'm guessing
---
Wait till April 9th 
---
How about fast travel? Is this simply erasing your memory of the journey so it feels like it never happened and the last thing you remember was just before travelling, and it only feels like a moment ago?
---
we shouldn't have to avoid spawn locations, using workarounds to poor game design is bullshit, just make the train stations neutral zones where no one can damage anyone else
---
It can be fixed if legendary effects are just nullified in the mode
---
Probably will come with the Sheepsquat quest.
---
Aha, thanks. 
---
But my fist is cold from the lack of a bear skull to keep it warm at night 
---
I wonder if the code is inverted, the amount you keep is actually what was meant for the person who killed you and vice-versa. Would be an easy coding error to make, and if they tested with low inventories in FAT, it may not have been detected. 
---
okay so say you have 50 meters around you while trading spawning or in a camp right. As soon as you pull your gun or you move out of that 50 meters you are up for pvp again. Trolls and spawn killers will just wait for you to move. You cant wait in there forever you have to move eventually and when you do your dead. Its just a delayed spawn kill now and not instant but its still a spawn kill. Can you propose a better system? Without taking away pvp in survival because I'd love to hear it. 
---
That sounds like a PvP mode to me
---
What is annoying is offering several items and when you barter on price, when you move around and the other person buys something listed, the other things move around... I lowered price on things I didn't want because of moved as I was clicking to adjust the price... 
---
I'm lvl 180. I work a lot so I've only played survival once, last night. 
---
Same complaints = more exposure. How is asking for new character starts "irrealistic"? lol
---
You seem to know a lot about what's good for this subreddit though, did you put in an application for the recent mod openings?
---
Yes this! Didn't the recent patch fix grass poking through your floors/foundations? Why can't we get the same for walls?
---
I dislike crafting shells with a mouthfull of tree. 
---
I think or goes beyond not playing this game, it shows a lack of understanding of open pvp mmos in general.
---
25 years isn't that long. If you went in at 15 or 20 you would be 40 or 45. That is prime age to survive the wasteland, especially one you have been training to survive. 
---
Did you have fun? What were your experiences and what would you like the mode to become?
---
Not into this. 
---
25 years isn't that long.
---
Ah, interesting. 
---
That bug happens on PC too. I'll be using my shotgun, pick up a new one and it'll be the one on the wheel. 
---
You are probably right.... so I will also get to wear a goat head while bear skull fisting people?
---
I can live with that 
---
Mmmm mole rat chunks
---
It'd be nice if servers were sorted into level 1-25, 25-50 and 50+. Otherwise, new players are still going to get 1-shotted by level 150's next month, even if the characters were a fresh start.
---
the one bone weapon, I forget which one, has a glitched out mod already attached that causes bleeding, but you have to be in the weapons bench to see it
---
So basicaly no fallout, more like battlefield. Ok.
---
I don't care what it is just put a marker above it so we can easily see it.
---
I'm assuming that was a sheepsquatch skull
---
Using beta as a description suggests prior levels of testing, like an alpha. Whomever suggested that this move out of that phase failed, or it wasn't done.
---
You’re right. But you know what’s more frustrating? When you get spawn killed repeatedly at whitespring station, then you decide to spawn at another station which is the one at top of the world (don’t remember the name) then walk all the way south thinking you will have revenge (foolishly) only 75% they way you meet a gang of super mutants who you manage to slaughter but since you were already dried out of all stims form the spawn kill so u can’t heal your near death health and then a stupid mutant dog comes from behind to give u the bite and destroy all your plans. Couldn’t feel like respawning all the way back to that station again. I’m still loving the pvp mode but I will need much more practice to master it. 
---
Demo just doesn't sound as good as "early access beta" when hawking for pre orders. 
---
Price is Charisma based.  You'll want to get you charisma up to 20 (16 with the hard bargain perk) for the best price.  Going by memory, it was around a thousand caps.
---
Man autocarrot hates sheepsquatch.... goatyeti is a subspecies do you think? 
---
*Dropping Spent Fuel Rods off at the Storage Pond*

😂true
---
I hope you and others get their accounts back.  And then buy Atoms to support the game.   
---
Hey Glorf12. I have been following your posts lately and while people like to downvote, I have found something that may interest you in another thread
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b67z88/to\_those\_who\_were\_suspended/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b67z88/to_those_who_were_suspended/)
---
Thanks 
---
Sounds like a positioning problem. I literally 1 v 3 Ed and won yesterday. They all had tse and one of  them had a tse shotty. They’re crap positioning and the fact that they just poured in within seconds of each other gave me enough time to kill them with ADS
---
Absolutely dude. Like half the population would log in right now to buy this stuff.
---
Yeah I did get that screen once I finally got bored and decided to just level, sure enough I got one shotted like 2 seconds after I leveled by one of those guys haha
---
yeah, no shit they can camp the perimeter, as I said, but a perimeter is harder to control than a fixed location and it gives the other player the opportunity to prepare rather than just getting killed before the game even fucking loads around you.
---
And that was a huge blow up in bgs face, Im not saying it won't happen that way again but just assuming it will doesn't help anyone.
---
Probably because in a design meeting someone suggested an alternative use of lunch boxes that they were considering using.
---
Has to be on a hill. And its kinda hard to get just right. But once you get the angle right it should work.
---
It’s a bear skull, sharp canines and otherwise similar teeth to human ones 
---
Good for you 
---
That "Ok" button is so passive aggressive, haha.
---
I want the bloodied handmade.
---
Yes, but that testing would have been focused more on stability and just ensuring the game does not crash.  Beta is more about balancing.  
---
I agree - I felt the compound effects of all those things (explosive, rifle, etc) was a bit much (as in, it was OP) - I just think they went too far in the other direction. Your suggestion makes sense...
---
Distinctly possible. I don't know that I find any enjoyment whatsoever from the longest life leaderboard, so the removal of tagging those players I guess is really what I'm after, if not the removal of that stat entirely. 
---
An excellent (and IMO, correct) argument. Red (orange?) arrow for you! 
---
I gave it a shot a few months ago when things were really ugly around here. A friend of mine had the game and was really enjoying it despite the negative publicity it was getting (some of it deserved). I gave it a shot and...... I love the game!
---
I've taken a few breaks here and there but when I left I did not have a bad taste in my mouth. The new Wild Appalachia dlc is really fun!  This FO76 ship is definitely headed in the right direction!  The atom shop is really turned around and the nuka shine and fashnacht quests were a lot of good times. The company feedback on posts has been really good the last few months as well. Great job Bethesda!  Keep plugging away!
---
See ya in the wasteland vault dwellers!
---
"YOU POOED GOOD. Slightly faster walk speed for 10 minutes."
---
No matter how much you prepare if the camper already has a bead on you your gonna die. And most spawn killers I've seen work in groups so you have 4 guys gunning for you. 4 eyes on 1 perimeter its not as hard to control as you think.  
---
Yeah, but the difference is very few weapons instantly kill. (Shotguns, snipers, etc.) In fallout almost every fucking weapon is instant because of these legendary effects that need to be removed from survival mode.
---
No vats? How many perks would become useless like that? Bad idea. 
---
&gt; You shouldn’t be an appealing target (no caps) and the hunters will be focused on much higher level players (more caps).
---
If that was the case then there never would have been high levels picking off lowbies in the original mode.  Caps isn't the motivation for those types.  What they want is the feeling of power that comes, ironically, from bullying someone who has little to no chance of defending themselves.
---
Not saying all PvPers fall into this category...just that this other faction does exist.
---
Also, back around release a friend of mine showed me a route he had come up with where he could fight a legendary pretty much once a minute averagely...but he only showed me once and I was way too tired at the time to remember it because it was complicated as hell, lol.  It was mostly in the far east (Mire) and around the bandit area (Top of the World and NE of there).  But those are the only details I could recall...because he was leading me all over the damned place.  And I don't think he plays anymore :(  This guy had a full suit of three star armor that had the prefix that gives you more resistance as your health decreased...I forget which one that is offhand.  But that was months ago.  Maybe he was cheating, but I think he was just crazily dedicated.  I'm really hoping that by now, all the actual cheaters have been banned (but you're right - that's probably a pipe dream).
---
Adventure mode sucks more because Pacifist mode is still kind a stupid. It seems that another player can still kill you if contest workplace even i do not return fire. Sad and one new feature, what i wont do anymore :D
---
How is that good news? The game blows
---
Ahh sorry consoles never crossed my mind haven't owned one since the megadrive.
---
What about the other armor types? The camo didn't work for me at all on those also? 
---
What is a short and long suit? 
---
I do agree with you that the leader board for longest alive is kinda stupid and does force you to have to hunt or be hunted when this should just be mostly the same as adventure, it be fun to just play with that option knowing that you could have to fight not just server hop. And i agree with the server either being one way or fresh start for your reasons. I didnt know the drop rate of aid items before i played but didnt want to risk it, i moved my low lvl guy over there for the xp.
---
Don't, it sucks
---
I post asking for it every other day in the bazaar, nothing. And you can't actively farm for that, you pull from the entire loot table, so basically you just told me to play the game a whole lot.
---
Yeah I agree. I posted this so long ago ahaha. 
---
Didn’t they say in the patch notes that when you fast travel you have invulnerability for a bit? Seems like it’s not working as it should and the complaining is bringing this to light.
---
I feel your dread through my pain. Lost my X01 torso w/ jetpack a couple of days ago.  I wasn't wearing it, just transferring it to a frame for stash space and got disconnected. Power frame came back to inventory on respawn, but no torso/jetpack.  Don't really use it as I'm marsupial, but hell, I wanted it and those for X01 are very hard to comeby.
---
Set up your camp  node close by, spawn there and get back at em. Also use chameleon mutation, on resoawn your invisible just jump and vats... Or run lol. Just your camp node, in a Bush or well hidden.  
---
I know, I’m possibly the last person on the planet with a job and family and friends and hobbies that are a higher priority than a video game.  
---
God, I’m so stupid.  
---
Why should I expect that I can sit down for an hour or two a week and play a game in my favorite franchise and enjoy myself? I foolishly thought games were meant to be enjoyed, but it’s intended to be a “grind”, you’re right.  And there are so many thing referred to as a “grind” that are meant to be enjoyable. 
---
I’m probably one of those /r/fo76filthycasuals people, all trying to enjoy myself in an online game.  What the fuck was I actually thinking? This is work, goddammit. Serious business!  Only people who put in 10 hours a day should be allowed to participate!  That’s what REAL gamers do, right?
---
And worse.. saying as much on the internet? Clinical insanity, that.  Just bonkers. 
---
Thanks for setting me straight, random internet person. 
---
It shows I own the camo pack in the atom store. I did purchase the camo power armor paint several months ago. Am I supposed to get all the other stuff as well? I checked to see if I could put camo paint on my hunting rifle today and it didn't appear to be an option.
---
Oh ok. Thank you for the information
---
Damn dude. Nice job.
---
I disagree on the details of that but you could be right idk.  From how I understand it, the larger the inventory access that once the more problems it causes for the server so having one Box of 800 and in a separate Box Of 800 would cause less server lag then one Box of 1600
---
Any update on this investigation? u/ladydevann 
---
it still is better than fucking dying before the game loads is it fucking not?  like are you seriously defending spawn camping?
---
If you’re gonna copy paste your responses at least format them so we can read them. Sounds like survival modes not for you, it’s alright just go back to adventure mode and come back when you get good.
---
The game has got a lot better, and adding a mode to .over the pvp players away from the regular fallout players was a much needed addition. Just wish they had not nerfed the weapons and the drop rate for legendaries in the blast zones. At least I'm not having to fight roaming bands of players attacking people and their camps as often now. 
---
I live with other people who don't appreciate me shouting at my computer at random times of the day, or are making too much noise for said mike to be useful.
---
Nobody else uses one anyway, so its not like it would change a lot.
---
Someone data mined it... Initiate can no longer drop. Knight is the first one that can drop now and you can only get the next one after you've learned the previous one. So you can continue to get knight paint plan duplicates until you learn it. Then you can only get the next one and it will keep dropping until you learn it. Once you learn elder paint, you can no longer get elder paint plans and there's nothing higher so that's it. 
---
Vats requires no skill, it's auto aim.
---
More live enemies spawn in, they need the polygon count, so the dead ones become simple piles. 
---
Oh man... if Bethesda doesn't give us Yao Guai claw gauntlets now...like... a shoulder length Yao Guai-leg glove 
---
Bethesda, I have a right to Bear Arms.
---
It's a little too crazy I think, but your head is in the right place.
---
You don't even have control when you respawn. As soon as you fade back in you're looking at a death screen
---
Im not defending it you keep coming back to that. All im saying is its going to happen in a open world game like this. You will get spawned camped its just a fact of how the world is made. You gotta find ways to beat the camper just like you beat a boss. 
---
Yeah the balance in survival seems to be fucked currently. I really enjoyed that barrage of mini nukes though. Same none of them seemed to even effect the guy 
---
Thats not why they did it, they used bags because otherwise everything would just be dropped on the ground and cause massive lag
---
I've always thought excavating for camps would be cool for areas like this. How cool would it be if you could have a little hidden entrance like this with like a two floor complex hidden underneath?
---
There is no way around a problem if you play it stupid. I can attest for myself as I spent four hours dominating the server until I played it stupid, and I was too proud to accept own defeat to back up without loosing ALL my caps and ALL my aid. Loved that TBH.
---
I must completely disagree with the concept of character level separation, because I done my homework and know how it would end up. It would end up exactly to favor my troll idea to build a low level godlike character. Imagine level 35 guy who oneshots full sentinel assassin level 200 guy because that is exactly what it would be doing. Its a mechanic that on paper seems fair but ends up as tool to grief people. My low-lvl PvP alt was supposed to be anti-griefer tool to play around as wasteland protector, but other PvP-focused players would probably just use it to troll everybody around.
---
That was the almost 1 month point that my support ticket had been open. It’s obvious that there is some frustration there. I had been nice in the previous part of my ticket. If I had this happen in the company where I work, they would’ve already taken care of it. 
---
Good for you, let's keep politics out of it boys and girls.
---
Mole rats and ticks 👍

Not sure if said yet, but I've had 3 star gulper spawns at thunder mountain substation-01 by harpers ferry.

Boy oh boy, I better not player pvp then, because I got lots of aids! Thanks for the heads up guys!

You broke the rules, why should they give a shot about you?

---
I actually have a mod on PC that does exactly that.
---
But then what's the point of snipers? You're hoping for one playstyle at the expense of another.
---
I have a habit of clicking vats running around so i can see bears and stuff before i am in combat. I think targetting other players in vats flags you in survival.
---
It's worth taking sneak just so you can sneak past the enemies to get to the players.
---
Or it’s teleportation...
---
I dont know how you deduce i didn't read anything about the update because i didnt know the rewards?
---
Now that i know the rewards (and thanks for the link), I'm even less inclined to try to win them.  Are you honestly exited to win one of those?
---
Hey, do you happen to know a good resource for seeing what all the plans make? I usually google them and get a hodgepodge of stuff that usually isn't terribly helpful. 
---
Surely a list is a list, wouldn’t the contents of bags exist in the game world the same as loose items, just a different server list?
---
That's crazy good!
---
Blame management not the devs. The devs do not get to choose when things are released and how
---
No fast travel at all. Not even to CAMP. Need to CAMP? Pay to set it up where you are.
---
true!
---
Literally me reading this:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l4ig1KoHy3I
---
Either they should have forced everyone to create a new character which honestly would keep the game alive a bit more and make thing fair.
---
Or they could have simply made servers tiered finally, at least for survival so you are playing with people around your own level.
---
Or both.
---
Omg what are you at? Lol
---
Via Bethesda Support on Twitter they say tickets are looked at as they come in, well this isn't exactly true. This posted on Twitter by a player got their ticket looked at and under review in less than 6 minutes on a Saturday... so not sure why tickets aren't looked at for weeks.

Hey there. I purchased the camo paint for the power armor awhile ago. In the atom store it shows I own it but I can't craft any of the items in the bundle at my crafting stations.
---
Right, so who wants to join my cult then?
---
when i get pissed, i always pick up the meet and eat it RAW
---
Couldn’t you silence your lever action? Lolz
---
Because, immersion-wise, the PIP-Boy 2000 mk VI didn’t have the technical capacity to have a map like the 3000’s did, which is why Vault-Tec supplied our vault with an actual map. 
---
Hey it would be something to do at the train station while you're waiting to use the vendor. rofl
---
 0.5 for snipers ok? :)
---
Is spawn chance linked to your “luck” stat, or just increases chances of dropping something really good? 
---
so you are saying you would rather have it how it is than have train stations be safe zones?  the literal only people that benefits is spawn capmers, ergo you are defending spawn camping.  I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO AVOID TRAIN STATIONS BECAUSE OF POOR GAME DESIGN, especially when there are better ways to do it, one of which I suggested, but you seem to think just avoiding train stations is the fix, it's not a fucking fix, it's a workaround, just fucking stop bro, you are either a camper or dumb as fuck, go away.
---
You are the reason servers crash out. Stop hoarding!
---
If someone is hunting you down, just place a bunch of PA down as decoys or use them as shields.
---
From someone who is really enjoying Survival Mode: **please do not read too much into the loudest criticisms**. It has issues, to be sure, but it's really, really fun too, and **some of the suggestions here would basically destroy its viability, making it the worst of both worlds**: not suitable for people who want complex engagements with other real players and not suitable for adventuring.
---
Having a way to find other players (the leaderboard leaders), for example, is essential - the game would get boring quickly if those of us looking for people to engage with couldn't find them. Already, when the leaderboard glitches out (sometimes none of the top three show up on the map), things get dull quickly. People who want to adventure have an entire mode for that - complaints about being unable to adventure in survival don't make sense.
---
Clearly there are issues with things like spawn killing, but those could be fixed by boosting/fixing time spent invulnerable. Also, a lot of us worked out workarounds in the first day like mobile CAMPs. There could also be spaces (e.g. area around Vault 76, maybe in/around Whitespring) where PVP is off-limits. 
---
**The biggest problem, though, is simply about balance.** There are a lot of people complaining about not doing damage and getting killed too easily, and there's a simple reason for that: right now, **the cavalier and sentinel armor makes certain people (particularly those who got high-end duped armor sets) nearly invincible**. I managed to cobble together enough non-optimal sentinel gear from farming for hundreds of hours to get by, but it shouldn't have to be that way. I just put together my first sentinel armor set the other day from pieces I'd accumulated (and from friends) and I was shocked at being able to stand still and be ten times as damage resistant - other seemingly impressive armor types like vanguard and bolstering barely make a dent by comparison. Newer players going up against veteran teams don't have a chance. I would suggest boosting damage resistance across the board and reducing the benefits of sentinel/cavalier - just my two cents.

Well we can't all run around with 10% health one shotting everything with our death claw gauntlet like Todd wanted. 
---
Lots of people saying its a bug or OP is full of shit. Anecdotal I know but just today I saw a level 4 in 1st place.
---
Give me more ticks - lets me make more stimpaks easily.
---
Are you able to one shot vats crit on someone with full health? I've noticed since the patch I am no longer able to.
---
But it never crashed before.
---
exactly..
---
Idk because my luck is only 8.
---
Changing this mode to deathmatch and revealing the top 6 would be awesome, that way not matter what, 1 group can't take up the full top players.
---
Survival mode should be the same as this game mode, but no players revealed. Keep bounties, but only to last seen location.
---
The lunchboxes are actually more inconspicuous than the bags. You can kick the lunchboxes around too so you could actually move your loot.
---
Hell yeah my actually okay bathroom will finally be useful and not take up a whole tile without doing anything

Oh ok that makes sense. So can i assume the player icons are projected from the pipboy or is this a high-tech map.

I really hope your joking or mocking the other idiots
---
OMG, please share pictures of your cosplay after this Saturday!
---
I’m not playing a mode that needs me locked in. No one will. Stop asking for this. You already need to be super careful using workshops in adventure or you’ll get ganked. You think I want to scav, travel to a trainstation and die? I’ll just play adventure. 
---
No I can one shot regardless of vats crit lol. 
---
We need an ironforge/stormwind 😁
---
Okay so I suggested a 50 meter safe zone around players to you a few comments ago. I'm just saying that no matter what changes there will always be spawn camping. If your dumb enough to think that means I support it than thats really sad. 
---
Maybe not for you 
---
The sales give me a good reason to but things that I was initially on the fence about. I definitely don't mind spending real money on stuff in the atom shop if its something I really want. I also don't mind helping with continued dlc and game support by purchasing things here and there.
---
Good post sir.
---
Or adapt and specc your char for pvp? Get Assasins gear, i can take hits from dmg that onehits others, just play the cards right and armor and you get what you want
---
1500 over your personal max is all thats allowed because hoarding and collecting thousands and thousands creates instability. The people who are over this limit are currently banned from the game until Bethesda can come up with a solution for them, because they make it too unstable. 
---
Look at this man. This is a brother right here.
---
I meant Executioner not exterminator lol. 
---
That was the last one I got, but I might have an extra. It's also one of my favorites because it turns my head invisible when I wear it! 
---
I'm usually online 10pm-midnight EST. Gamertag is the same as my Reddit name. Come find me!
---
Lol carring that much does cause issues. I can verify this. Its not all negative. Like when you enter watoga before it loads
---
Dont you have armor with reduced weight perks? Thats the only way I move, cuts my stuff in half
---
why?  for wanting a better solution to spawn camping than just "avoid the spawn campers"?
---
found the spawn camper...
---
If you let someone with 10% health beat you that's on you bro. 
---
I love PVP but I hate that it gets forced on me.
---
Have absolutely no interests in that whatsoever.
---
And I agree. After so much time it will be the same wasteland it is now. Have you ever played any survival mmo that exists? People will hoarse good shit and there will always be griefers. At least in this game you can build up an inventory without getting griefed to death and then join the PvP server. Ark was ruined by big groups that server hopped and built up supplies and they had to start new on every server. Look at rust, you have to start a new character every server and now new players are just spawn killed regardless. You may think this suggestion sounds great, but it's literally been done for years and it kills games.
---
You can kick around normal lunch boxes but death droppings in a lunch box may have the same mechanics attached as the brown bags, no way of knowing unless they implement this.
---
I know that when you make a pile of bodies they turn into meat piles faster, probably to make looting easier 
---
Or just do what I did, put thought into your character, grind what you feel will be effective and go slay. If you weren’t an idiot your build woulda worked out. If you where an idiot the. Your gonna get smacked 
---
I'm convinced people who play survival as it is, are griefers and just want easy instant gratification....hence just sit at train station and shoot anything that fast travels there....As they pat themselves on the back for having no skill at all.....slow clap\* Bravo!! You are the best!!! LOL! Get real...
---
Hmm, ok. I'll fiddle with it some more. 
---
It's a beta and the series first attempt at multiplayer. To say it's going to be rocky is an understatement. I'll gladly play with the new pacifist mode on until they figure out how this system actually works. 
---
Then play a game without vats, there’s a million of them. You’re not using your brain. You make a build with perks. What good are perks if a dozen or more are nullified by a new mode? 
---
but as I pointed out, perimeter camping literally isn't spawn camping, so no, it won't always exist when there is a safe zone...  so just fucking come off it already.
---
Although I agree with you stating it is essentially built in aim bot, it is a big part of what has made the series unique and that shouldn't be discarded lightly
---
Do you mind some details tips?
---
You can get a set of weightless sentinel though.
---
Both activate when standing still.
---
But then it would need to render all the items if they are loose which would put a bigger strain on everything plus keep everything together. Imagine being pelted with grenades only to die, drop your stuff and one more nade launch your stuff every which way. 
---
My black powder pistol should deal 1,800 damage with a 2.5x sneak attack, 2x head shot, and 1.85x critical hit. It leaves people with about 20% health remaining so I am already dealing 10% of my weapons damage. It is not very fun. This is a poor idea. I do not want my 53 base damage 10mm pistol to be doing 5 damage per shot to a person.

Survival as it currently stands is heavily biased against high damage. It is better to do shitty damage quickly than high damage slowly. I swapped back to an automatic pistol build and was magically able to handle multiple enemy team members with ease. Some testing by a dude on Xbox reported damage is being dealt as percentages based on weapon type. Automatics apparently kill in five bullets. Damage resistance does not matter. A 10mm pistol shoots about 7 bullets in one second. A black powder pistol takes like five or more seconds to reload, and you cannot kill with one shot.
---
Fights are longer with high damage weapons and shorter with low damage weapons. I guess that is an overly simplistic and somewhat effective way to "balance" or "normalize" damage between every caliber of player.
---
I bought a cav chest off the bazaar for 8k a couple of days ago. Not saying it isnt difficult to find someone selling them for caps But its there.
---
As far as farming in game you are right about getting specific gear. However you do get bloodied weapons of different types fairly often. Not to metion the other legendaries that would go for 1kish if you tried selling them on reddit. Also junk and ammo sell pretty good for the right price. Not hard to come up with 25k. You do have some buying power with that amount of caps. This is how I grinded for the weapons I have. A different grind, and a pain in the ass. But none the less its doable. 
---
The Short and Long Suots are basically your regular business suit but with a Camo pattern. Long Suit comes with regular suit pants while Short Suit comes with Suit Shorts instead.
---
You do with your camp node close by, I respawn in the bushes lol. Can't say where for obvious reasons.
---
Get in adventure mode, pick a spot and set your node up then jump in Survival. Simples. 
---
My fear exactly!
---
I have no idea about the player icons. I’m just gonna rack that up to quality of life for the players or something like that. 
---
I can't be against making the enemies harsher, except if the idea was to make them spongier. I'd love a level 150 Deathclaw that simply kills you if it gets to you, no math done. It'll be a game of chasing the guy around as a group.
---
I'd love if the behemoth guy could pick you up and eat your head, but simultaneously be made so that if circled and attacked from behind, periodically stunned so that the crazy melee guys could still go against him.
---
I'd love to have human NPC enemies that snipe you hard and that'd have their third shot a vats crit headshot, so you'd have to scout the area you enter before you commit to it.
---
I'd love if being as geared as I am,  I'd be seeing some shit and retreat, calling my friends for fucking immidiate backu- /dies in artillery fire mid-sentence because of lack of proper shelter/
---
Making them take more bullets is what I wouldn't love.
---
Its still a spawn kill its just slightly delayed you wont be able to leave that safe zone just as you arent able to leave the spawn currently in the game. 
---
To be fair, that wasn't PvP, that was you fleeing like a refugee until you were hunted down like a dog. If you enjoyed it, well, I guess Survival will be great for you. Maybe you'll change your mind when dying costs you 250+ caps every time.
---
I didn't play stupid, I scavenged some junk returned to my camp where there was an invisible level 70 character who killed me instantly because he was waiting invisible on my roof. There is no way of knowing he was there and it couldn't be played around.
---
I don't understand what you're saying in the second part. Level separation wouldn't work because you could make a strong character? Hoe could you 1 shot someone 165 levels above you if they weren't in your game? I mentioned in my next point that overpowered builds need to be tuned specifically with PvP in mind. 
---
SOLD I’ll take the lever action 
---
I mean, i am level 38 and i was playing with a level 8 friend just tryina do some quests when we got ambushed by a squad of 44 level 100+ players using stealth boys that killed both of us instantly and ran away. They were hunting down everyone on the map in spite of us not showing up on the map. That pissed me off quite a bit cause we had to trek a long way back to where we were. If they were players of our own level then that would have been fair
---
DAE hate console peasants
---
PC Master race amirite
---
Oh wow.  So i really have to start actually looking at what monsters have.
---
I never keep everything.
---
I always go to bench, scrap, keep components i need, sell to vendors  or give away to players for free.
---
Then maybe you can help me understand what happened cause I'm going to guess this guy had that sentinel/ assassin armor combo people are talking about because all the rifleman perks, armor pen magazine, 3* bloody mess and tank killer couldn't bring the guy down. I was dealing such little damage to him it made me laugh. I hit him with a full 20 round mag while he hit my poor under leveled teammates pretty confident i'd at least kill him once since he had not health. Imagine my surprise.
---
I guess different folks play different ways but as someone that enjoys the role playing a bit more, I would be OK with being locked into my choices.  Maybe have more of a tree based system, so my higher level perks build on existing perks and choices.
---
I don’t see the kits or load outs as a compromise, because I can switch them out now at will: it’s just such a big pain in the butt (and sort of anti role playing) that it dissuades my from playing the game. I’ve gotten where I’ve picked SPECIALS and perks just to minimize swapping rather than any strategic or role playing benefit.
---
For example, I have Charisma a 7 not because I play with others and get the perks (I mostly solo) or that I see my character as all that suave, but just that I don’t want to have to switch Lone Wanderer for Hard Bargain every time I want to visit a vendor.
---
Dude killed zero people. "#1"
---
I had not seen this. If it's true, I will be in heaven ❤️
---
Usually when I need to fast travel in survival mode it's because I'm trying to get to a spot I know where someone is. If I'm flipping between game mode and switching servers they're not going to be there by the time I join back. I understand what you're saying, it just works in so few situations
---
Diablo 2 had a shared stash? Nice, it didn't back when I played and that sucked badly. 
---
I love when developers post. Thanks.
---
Now if I only knew what causes those random freezes. All performance logs I've looked at seem inconclusive.
---
Despite from assasin, cards: barberian, Ironclad, evesive etc will help you alot, if you are not playing with PA. Then if you get tierd of exploives from granades or wepons, fireproof. 
---
I get that, but it doesn't explain why the enemies I killed 2 minutes ago stay corpses, while the one I kill just now immediately turns into a pile.
---
I have had my tickets looked at in mere minutes as well when I had some login issues after the booze update.
---
It was only up for 24 hours and that's why I bought it. It ran out I think dude
---
Well I think by that time, I might be more powerful and better equipped than a level 4.  I just think it is funny that a brand new character can be on the leader board.
---
Well they removed that now. Hope they'll do something for the spawn griefing next time.
---
500 caps
---
You still want this pole hook? If not I'm going to put it up for sale again. I don't mind holding it a little bit, I just want to know. 
---
I know that they aren’t safe. You know this. Now OP knows this. 
---
But Bethesda said in their patch notes that they ARE safe for however long their cooldown period is. If you aren’t keeping up with the discussion here you’d reasonably expect that cooldown to work. 
---
I frickin love the look, it should have been the helmet on the cover art imo. 
---
Those toilets are already destroyed, this feels unnecessary. 
---
What's your psn and are you going to be on soon?
---
Here we go again. I died because player type x is too powerful so let's nerf it for everyone else.....
---
Does... does *anyone* play in Survival mode as though they want to actually play the game, but with  higher risk? Or is it all "kill err'body" all the time?
---
I was kinda hoping for "FO76, but watch your back"
---
Not "Running Man 76"
---
You make some great points. I guess the alternative is that they could just get better at balancing the game. I hope they take that route, since it would offer benefits for their single player game design as well. Think Skyrim: everyone becomes a stealth archer since it's clearly the most OP build. If they learn through PVP how to actually balance different builds and play styles, that may pay dividends for their next single player game. 
---
Was this a revenge type battle? 
---
And did you have enough caps?
---
If you get hit with that PVP damage penalty than it for sure feels like the other person is invincible. Because they basically are. 
---
So I got 2 ppl who want it so it's a 1st come 1st serve
---
Only three stars count? I was wondering why my challenge meter wasnt going up. That is savage
---
For legendarys you need to farm whitesprings or west tek, events like Uranium fever. For camp items simply take over public workshops for random plans.
---
why can't I leave the safe zone?  if there is only one camper I have the opposite side of the perimeter to make my move, and even if each cardinal direction is camped by each member of a team I could utilize a stealth boy.  point is I have options and the ability to see what might be waiting for me, whereas now when I spawn in I'm dead before the world can even load in, like how is one *not* better than the other?
---
Meet the greatest post made by a single person for CAMP builders haha :) 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/acvptm/wip_i_made_a_visual_catalog_matching_camp_assets/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Who says nobody else uses them?
---
I could've swore that was only the forest camo for the PA. There was another one that had desert camo for PA, a couple guns and leather/metal armor. It got confirmed that it was temporarily taken down as the shotgun camo wasn't working. It should be back up soon! But thanks for offering up some info!
---
It's even more useless for a tank or medic since tanks need to have a high HP and medics are useless if dead. It's really just all around terrible and needs a full rework
---
I think you're missing the point here. I don't see why there should be a 25k caps barrier to entry. No one wants to do that for some half-assed deathmatch fun. You should just be able to compete reasonably without having to farm like that.
---
Yes. But this guys isn't giving feedback. He's just saying it sucks. He isn't giving any specifics on what's wrong. I've heard that they've balanced the game so that levels are far less relevant. You can't just say that this sucks and someone should be demoted. Like why dude.
---
I don't think you're reading what I'm typing so I'm done. 
---
That’s disappointing 
---
Here, and I've just been running to a red rocket or train station to stash all my shit when I start going up too high on the leaderboard from living too long. You know they're coming to kill you as soon as you hit #3. I guess I'll build a suicide tower instead, it seems easier than trying to run to stash all my shit.
---
If it weren't for that damn leaderboard making you visible, this mode would be great. I started a new character just for survival, and having a level 200 show up to one hit me ever 45 minutes just because my number came up on the leaderboard just means I'm playing against a clock, not other players. No point in being a stealth character if everyone can see where you are.
---
My PC is the ruler of the universe!
---
It’s very nice to have, but sadly it’s only good if you have a full set, because of that and the increased demand for stealth-sentinel pieces for survival mode the value has shot up. I’d realistically buy it for that.
---
Thank you for allowing your insecurity to poke through, and taking that as a personal attack.
---
No he just started attacking my friend, she's level 17 so I figured I'd try and help her out. I'm not rich, but certainly not broke and he hadn't killed me previously. I figured it was that weird combo because the four of us couldn't hurt him at all. 
---
Same as my reddit name. I can get on right now.
---
Maybe they’ll make an event out of them
---
Just sent a friend request, definitely need to hit your shop
---
Thus far only the one 3 star I have seen counts towards my challenge. Haven't seen a 2 star yet,  but none of the 1 stars seem to count.
---
It's auto aim...&amp; your perks card are interchangeable, you are not forced to use VATS, Auto Aim Shouldn't be allowed in Survival Mode. I never use VATS because I have skills you do not ...obviously.
---
What would you think of this idea? They do let the dupers back but they completely wipe their inventory clean.
---
No response?  You have no reasonable argument why level 1 should be in the same server as level 100?  Oh right, you already said they shouldn't be playing survival mode as a level 1.  Which is an extremely closed minded perspective and fails to see the potential enjoyment in that sort of experience.  If you aren't fully geared and ready to gank noobs, the game isn't for you.  If you just want to play it again with the added threat, fear, excitement and action of open pvp, then I guess you better go farm an adventure character through the entire game just to have a chance to play in this mode.  So no one is "allowed" to try to experience the game from start to finish in a new mode?  Is it designed for late game only?  Then don't give us the option to start new characters as it is clearly not a good experience for anyone besides spawncamping cunts
---
WE HEARD YOU LIKE TO TAKE BIG DUMPS
---
SO WE PUT A TOILET IN YOUR VIDEO GAME SO YOU CAN SHIT WHILE YOU SHIT
---
Other than vendors, does anyone know where to find them?
---
becuz atomsssss
---
Just dm me your psn and I'll add you 
---
It’s still the same game with no substantial new content. I’m there because PvP is the only event/quest that’s unique every time. Human AI isn’t predictable like computer AI. So yeah, I’m only there to kill people. I wish I could auto-reject events because I’m not really interested in doing them anymore.
---
When you find a certain faction later on in the game, you can turn them in for caps/exp/ammo/aid and a chance at rare items/plans. 
---
Seems like that’s the way it’s going to be. Thanks!
---
Good to hear they're communicating with you, that seemed like a weak point in their handling of this.
---
They've said from day 1 that they're suspending the accounts until they can eliminate duping (or as close as they can come to that I assume).  I have no idea what that could mean, maybe once they stop detecting duping, maybe once they have a tracking system in place to find dupes, maybe something else.  I don't suspect they'll tell anyone what that milestone is, I wouldn't in their place.
---
Thanks for posting that, I'm genuinely interested in how this whole situation progresses.
---
Just discovered I can downvote myself... 😎 
---
If it is the armor combo than you just bank crit hits. Flys right through that stuff. 
---
Uhm, you know, FO76 had a closed beta too. After which they still released the same build as the beta and thus shit hit the pan.
---
Just because something is claimed to be beta doesn't necessarily means it's so. Now why would a beta reward 2-3* legendaries, for example? You don't play a test mode to get advantage.
---
I do I’ll be on to night when I get on I’ll add you and we will coordinate then
---
How are people one shoting others? I shot a naked level 6 player crouched down hiding in a shack with a black powder pistol for approximately 1000 damage and he had 20% of his life remaining. Do you use two shot or something? Maybe the second hit extends past that damage cap? But shotguns don't seem to... So confused.
---
Ok going to add you now
---
True but even if you were invulnerable for let’s say five more seconds you would still have the same result here, let’s all be honest here.  What time frame of invulnerability would be good enough?  Enough time to build a camp with turrets and for everyone to form 4 person squads to team up against the people camping on the spawn point?  What would be given next to provide the strategic advantage? Portable 360 degree cover? Ghost team members? Complaint generated angelic harp powered sonic pistols?
---
My point is that the invulnerability will not keep people from blindly respawning into a meat grinder and blaming it on something else other than bad tactics.
---
Well, I can tell the difference over the course of shooting hundreds (thousands?) of mobs, prior to the nerf and then on several dozen or a hundred or so, after. I used the same two guns for something like 45 levels. Having said that, I don't use VATS, so my accuracy is all in whether they fall in my scope or not. I'm not aware of the in-game physics on whether the second bullet hits or not, and if that's a thing, it's definitely something I didn't know about. 
---
Having said that, it would mean they made a change to non-VATS accuracy and it's also impacting the second bullet. 
---
Regardless - it's a massive change to the damage of guns that were supposedly not even the ones that were supposedly targeted for this nerf. (Or the intended guns and a whole lot of other ones did as well..)
---
I have logged in once or twice (as mentioned above) and I still don't see a lot of change. Except that sometimes, I do a lot of damage with one shot, and then the damage is erased. (That happens about 30-40% of the time on headshots. I mean, what's the point?)
---
Ultimately, it's a type of game play (sniping) that I enjoy in a lot of games, not just Bethesda  - and they've made it a lot less fun between the change to damage output and  the increased "erased" damage, etc. 
---
And as my intended post was hoping that Bethesda noticed - I guess we'll see. In the meantime, it's one less customer spending Atoms in their store or buying swag, etc. (It's not a whine. It's just a statement of cause (nerf) and effect (me not spending $$). As a diehard fan of Bethesda (woot! I have Blades on my phone right now) - I'm just hoping they listen.
---
this alone is why I wont go near the mode. It's not survival when you introduce leaderboards and map pips that say "Go kill this guy here, he has been alive so many minutes..."  
---
I love a survival challenge and have put thousands of hours in survival games like Rust, 7 Days to die, and so on, and would probably come out on top more than I would be on bottom, but I have no desire to pvp non-stop with a bunch of tryhard level 200's who have duped weapons you cannot even get anymore unless you luck out with that one in a billion drop rate.   
---
Give the playing field some form of balance, remove the stupid over here idiot map pips, and I might think about it.  
---
The weapon you get isn’t even that good. A grenade launcher? Who the hell is going to use that?
---
&gt;Why don't I ever get BOS paint or plans
---
Has it been confirmed that BOS Plans can drop from Tech Data?  Not just paints?
---
I have up to Paladin Paint so far but have not Received BOS Plans from it.  I do already know them all though....
---
My bloodied sniper gets killed the second I get sighted anyway, but I have chameleon mutation, maybe I will just grind for some weightless and wear whatever. Either that or wear hooded rags and say fuck it lol
---
Another player may have moved through the area causing more spawns
---
other people in the server killing lots of stuff at the same time
---
Based on my brothers and my experience it seems like only the final hit counts. We killed about 7 starred legendaries between us 20 regular legendaries. But I only got credit for 2. 
---
Yeah I’m on Xbox. Thanks I really appreciate it. 
---
It’s incredibly OP in pvp.
---
Well the stash limit comes to mind
---
I will check again tonight.   Maybe my game was just bugged out last night.  (I know, unheard of, right?)
---
Do you know how fast rats breed?
---
I’d like to see a new temporary event every week. 
---
Yes I understand you actually have to stealth. That's my point.
---
No problem, If you want to dm me or post your GT, I'll message you when I do
---
Wait what's going on? 
---
&gt; Blame the ~~devs~~ game companies
---
Is that better? Semantics
---
Check your ammo tab
---
Yeah absolutely!  Honestly the biggest problem with 76 is that they decided to make the Explosive Weapon modifier a secondary and not primary ability so it couldn't be paired with Anti-Armor and Two-Shot.  Big time whiff there.  Same with Sentinel and Cavalier.  Those both should not be secondary effects that can pair with Assassin/Unyielding/etc.  They should have been primary effects so they couldn't be turned into absurd combos.  I would love to see how those game design discussions went initially.  Like... who the hell thought two-shot and explosive would be ok on the same weapon?  In Fallout 4 those were already the two best legendary prefixes for ranged weapons and they allowed them to be combined?!  Insanity lol
---
Berry mentats, recon scopes, your minimap defeats all your points 
---
They posted it in their notes about that. I'm not sure I remember exactly but when you hit your total max weight, you now have to destroy stuff vs drop it. It also had to do with duped stuff, so if duped X amount of items that filled your stash and inventory, then you'd have to destroy it rendering it useless to anyone. I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong
---
The servers were down for the patch, thus post patch.
---
Bruh what?? I swear it was a one shot kill now you're making me confused. I turned around and clicked on him like I would on a ghoul and he croaked. Maybe he was already hurt or something?? 
---
Buy some armor or weapons on reddit that will god it’s value, then sell it down the line for caps. Basically if Bethesda incorporated this then everyone would be running around with zero caps, given some players already do this by dumping them on their mule characters. 
---
Items painted with Atom items will be destroyed when dropped. You cannot sell them, give them away, nor drop them as a paper bag.
---
Drop one to destroy it and make sure you still have the original. If it works, do the same to the rest.
---
I feel like it just randomly happens at log in. It seems like it's not the stealth that's not working, but the enemy perception is way too high. I was, crouched, with full chameleon and maxed sneak on the roof of the tattoo shop and somehow the ghouls in the building across the street were all alerted to me. Nothing I did took me out of danger. I had to sneak all the way over to Mama Dolce's for them to lose me. It's like their perception radius and ability is massively multiplied. Had this happen at Whitespring. I was almost to Summersville before my caution went away from the golf club ghouls alerting to me. And then once I got close to Summersville, all the supermutants alerted. Again again, I was almost to Sutton station before they lost me. Then I switched servers and it wasn't an issue any more.
---
Yes I know the game had a "beta" I answered this same thing from someone else if they had run a real beta and not a glorified demo there wouldn't have been *nearly* as many bugs and issues as there were and still are.
---
That "beta" at launch blew up in their faces and if they do the same thing again they deserve all the hate they get but assuming it'll be the same bs again isn't helping anyone now with this survival beta.
---
Inventory management 
---
Well since you feel that you got nothing to do, I have a challenge for you.
---
Make a new character, and use them in survival only, meaning no switching to adventure mode.
---
Most people are pretty ballsy about it, and I found it to be not too difficult, until you end up on the leaderboard.
---
None of them counter perception placing enemies on your compass. You stop being a noob, you didn’t even know perception had anything to do with it and now you’re arguing cards effect it. You’re not fooling anyone kiddo, get outta here.
---
It's not really Semantics. The devs work hard to do what they are told they have to do and if they read this it makes them discouraged and start to hate the thing they usually love doing. The management team however needs to start actually listening to the community who plays their game before they lose what community they have. 
---
Hopefully that is just lip service from Beth, and your cheating ass is never allowed to bring those characters back.
---
I was just going to say the same thing haha
---
I found a putrid glowing one towards the center of Lewisburg once, when I was trying to get a supply cache.
---
&gt;barberian, Ironclad, evesive etc will help you alot
---
I've heard mix things about the DR perks. Some people say they are great, some people say they are useless. Fireproof is a necessity, but do DR perks actually significantly effect your character?
---
Its up to 800, you cant make some room? poor excuse.
---
Thank you. I don’t care much about the “you shouldn’t have”. I just care about the communication. I’ve been there since the bag (I bought the CE). I didn’t care about it, but their communication on it was lacking. Just glad to receive some info. 
---
Scorched beasts can drop them, got the legs a week ago from a 65
---
All my ammo are normal. No crazy numbers. 
---
I use a mod that implements lunch boxes instead of bags. You can kick them. I did this once when I was over 1200 LBS and couldn't move so I kicked/shot/exploded my extra loot to a vendor.
---
Well, there is no one shot restrictions, I just got killed 5 times in row by same player, one shot each time. Also, it's funny how they didn't mention fatman is suicide gun. I get it would be overpowered in pvp but i was trying to use it when surrounded by lvl 50 major gutsys not players so why did it kill me? Nukes just blows in your face when launched. better option would be making player immune to nukes.
---
Ye from about 10legendaries i killed in watoga counted only 3. I am not sure if i will be able to do 25in week lol.
---
I'd be more scared of the chameleon snipers with bloody weapons. 
---
I might have been thinking of torchlight tbh
---
Well there's literally no benefit to being on the leaderboard, and sitting in place hiding is incredibly boring. I'd personally love if someone did that on my server. Just one more person keeping me out of the top 3 😂
---
The new bloody combat paint isn’t usable with the BOS mods?  Or the BOS coloring is just overridden by the new selected paint?
---
Disagree. I'm having a blast in the new mode. I do think kill count should be swapped with time survived though.
---
But that's my point... it'd be fun to hop over and play the main game, with the added tension of constant threat. 
---
But... seeing as how it's "FO Battle Royale", I have little interest.
---
You also need to do it in the fallout76.ini file in both your my games folder AND the ini that's in the game directory with the .exe file. Total of 3 places. Custom doesn't work.
---
Then you'll need to do it again if you open your settings menu in the game because it will reset one or both files. Same after a patch.
---
Lol I’d have loved to have been there to see that 🙂
---
If only I had plans. I don't have plans for the lever action, don't know where to find them either.
---
So for a while now I have been something of a mole rat apologizer for a lot of reasons.
---
But there are way to many dedicated spawns for them. They could do with less of a presence. 
---
So for those curious here are the reasons I don't hate them. 
---
* Low health: Even at high levels they never take an inordinate amount of ammo to put down unlike rad rats  
---
* Modest challenge the high pen on their attacks along with the high disease  chance means the is some risk to engaging them
---
* fev Bio weapons: The off the charts breeding scale, relentless hostility towards humans all, ability to chew through concrete, all of that was intentionally put there to help them cripple Chinese cities 
---
* Tasty
---
In then end though there are just to many of them.
---
&gt;It’s clear that the majority of players aren’t happy w/ survival mode
---
Based upon what metric?
---
The lvl 1 welcoming committee.
---
If you have them maxed out, while using vanguard armor, you get very close to the numbers power armor has in terms of resists (minus the radiation resistance).
---
I am 200level with sentinel armor. Camping level 19 killed me from behind with handmade. This weapon is for fancy kills. Not to be the best.
---
Thats not true but sorry if it felt this way, and I'll rephrase my point. I think the point is to think about thr consequences, and what would happen if you'd separate the survival servers based on character levels. And what would happen would be that instead of having that survival experience unspoiled, every fucking griefer out there would be stockpiling low level godrolls because that level locked servers would be the place to go if you wanted to use the advantage against people that cannot oppose them.
---
How so?
---
yep
---
gameplay and story segregation. there is no in-lore reason for the icons, it's just a gameplay mechanic.
---
At least FromSoftware dont listen to people like you
---
Maybe. If you are still into this type of game, take a look at Grim Dawn. It's pretty amazing ;) 
---
I have 0 desire to do survival mode.  Everyone else can play it and maybe the adventure servers will become more stable.  The standard adventure mode is brutal enough for me
---
See this is a great perspective on the problem right here.  If people want to just join and kill, they reduce any risk to themselves to the point where it's exploitative.  Drop all your aid and move your caps to a mule before you play!  Thus removing any tension from your own experience, any drama from potential loss, and also fucking over anyone who kills you as they get no benefit from doing so.  In a sticky situation?  Just hop over to adventure and deal with it then pop back into survival when you're ready.  Where is the challenge in this?  How is it enjoyable?   
---
Personally I am very interested in replaying the game in survival mode for more challenge, more fear and excitement, more struggle and strife.  But that's not what this is at all.  If this is the game they wanted, why not just make everyone spawn in a big arena?  The grounds of whitesprings are the only accessible areas, everyone just runs around killing each ither.  You said yourself that's the only reason you're playing this mode.  But what I think you meant, was killing people who aren't ready for it, or aren't prepared to deal with it.  It just seems like there's nothing here for fallout players who wanted a more challenging adventure mode.  Instead we got an adventure mode where you just get slaughtered and robbed, not one where your choices or your interactions matter in any way.  We got deathmatch, not survival.
---
 Can back this 
---
No. High health is the way to go. My testing reveals that perks don’t matter. Sentinel assassin is the only thing that appears to matter in regards to damage taken, but melee just isn’t the way to go.
---
Legendary effects that aren’t instigating appear to be worthless. A hit with the powerfist for example does about 33 percent health damage. Instigating makes that 66 percent. Then it’s two hits, even if you’re dealing 800 damage to the for.
---
What must be remembered is that a 60 damage Handmade does an equal percentage of health damage to the enemy.
---
Standard Handmade rips through in 3 shots. Further testing today reveals that an auto Handmade kills in 4-5.
---
Furthermore, the current meta is Assassin, sentinel armor, w/stealth boy and any type of handmade (preferably with 25 percent faster fire rate and/or less vats cost)
---
Executioners appears to also do virtually nothing, along with Furious, A.A. and Bloodied. Armor points don’t matter at all anymore. Aim at increasing health.
---
Ok, I added you I’ll fast travel to you.
---
Bethesda looked at what PVE players complained about regarding PVP and implemented those changes into Survival.
---
For whatever reason, they ignored sentinel and cavalier armor. Like you said, high damage weapons we're great for burning down those invincible players with a critical hit.
---
I was one of those black powder users. I calculated 1,800 damage under ideal circumstances. It kills nobody. I have to slowly swap weapons to take off that last few health points. I swapped back to automatic pistols due to it being faster to just shoot people with less damage, more often.
---
You thinks it’s 100% perfect the way it is?
---
All great ideas, thanks for posting this. 
---
I will say that balance is tricky... I would implement those changes last. There are counters to just about everything. Personally I don't fear Assassin's/Sent or Cav because I can crit through them in pretty easily. The bane of my existence are always invisible toons due to stacks of stealth boys.
---
Well here’s the thing. If it’s not good enough to get kills, how are you going to get said fancy kills? You may be able to get someone with a bloodied build or lower levels, but other than that, it’s going to be difficult.
---
Kinda sucks for vats builds though. Make just disable armor ignore on crits in pvp. Or reduce its potency.
---
dude, are you fucking serious, regardless, how is having time and options, limited as they may be, *NOT BETTER THAN DYING BEFORE THE FUCKING GAME EVEN LOADS!!!*  seriously, either you're a troll or you're a griefer that likes to spawn kill people for their junk, either way fuck off.
---
Yeah but that's one specific build what about the others ? 
---
Yes I seen that but ultimatley I think it was only availible for 24h. That's what made me buy it lol. It will come back tho. 
---
You interested?
---
Do you feel like I am being unobjective in those videos (recent ones)? That really is my goal to talk about the positives, but there still are negatives. How come you feel like I am missing that? 
---
Hah you’re so skilled. So skilled you have to come on here and complain about something you think isn’t fair and want a mode tailored exactly to your wants. 
---
Vats is here to stay. You’re the one banging your head  against a brick wall with unrealistic ideas. 
---
Walahh!
---
I've thought the same thing.  Little pre-packaged gift boxes.  Sometimes by the time I've dropped everything I want to drop, the intended recipient has already fast traveled away 
---
I've noticed a huge drop in my superduper perk 3 since patch it seems. Used to bang out 50 or so stem packs every few days to resupply. I'd get a bonus being every 4 or 5 crafts. Now it seems I can craft 50 and get no extras pretty often. Not complaining, just commenting
---
I have no issue with any of the points you brought up. Legendary effects, map markers, or existing characters.
---
Well, they could remove all of my items and I’d be fine. I’m not concerned with those. 
---
Don’t like vats? Get chameleon armor or stealth boys.
---
I mean, I guess you could and just kill people you happen upon along the way. Eventually you're going to survive too long and be marked on the map. Then you'll be hunted. Maybe people will eventually play survival mode for more than PvP, but right now that's not the case. I imagine somebody is currently doing the challenge to get the legendary weapon that isn't quite racking up player kills left and right
---
If text chat were available, who'd buy emoticons? ;-)
---
This is fair! I’m not saying it’s terrible, but even you admit things could be changed. I’m just afraid of a Into the Vault post asking for feedback(similar to the event and enemy ones) that we’ll never see action on until late summer/early fall
---
I've been killing anybody from lv 17 to lv 289 in one shot with my gauss.
---
I mostly do that because I have melee build, but people got bored of watching the melee gameplay 
---
For 2 months i keep making up my mind if i should build there or not. Love the space but i think you get attacked pretty often
---
Disagree . this. Is just another remove op items from game post. Survival wasnt ment for you to run in bare bines its a HIGH risk server meaning the strong survive and the weak dont plain n simple. Its ment for us end game players who have nothing else to do. Its ment to be full of death. After finishing all the quests and farming countless hours.  I feel im entitled to such gameplay i wanna be able to go in and fight other plays with endgame gear to make it intresting. Why ruin that for the other players who also want the same challenge. At the end of the day you still have your adventure server dont try and enforce removing legendary effects and stsrting new toons when its in the game for a reason its not ment to be easily killed. Just have fun with it go on market and buy some gear. Make friends who have gear and or just have fun all around and leave things the way they are.
---
Tse pump does not damage, tse minigun breaks only camps, instagasting hunting rifle is my main wep 2-3hits to kill.
---
That wouldn't work though. You can only have 3 characters, and killing enemies gives you xp. Your characters will rise up through the level gaps. And you have to rely on luck to get God roll gear, unless you farm which will level you up really fast. 
---
Dont get me wrong, I know there would be smurfs, I just dont think they'd be effective when you cant even hold a hunting rifle until level 5
---
Exactly. I have a gift! I’m not trying to hurt you! Some people are like deers
---
I actually stopped doing those after some of the hate 
---
you can buy the lever action plans in grafton train station
---
Disgusting imo
---
the best suggestion I've seen about survival mode is: no legendary effects
---
legendaries make it, imo, impossible to balance
---
&lt;3 you're the best
---
You tell me. You do not die at 100% HP. If he was below 80%, sure you can kill him, but at maximum HP, always some life left.
---
I've dealt that 1,800 damage against sentinel users, melee players, power armor users, a naked low level players, and everything in between. If you have maximum HP, you live.
---
...You realize that this tactic happened long before Fortnite, right? It started back when jumping was brought into competitive FPS games.
---
The problem is players building bases that overlook the spawns, the build zone needs to be pushed back further imo.
---
Will do! thanks!!
---
What about luck?
---
What's your idea of lock levels?
---
Wish I was going Saturday
---
Only Friday for me
---
Hey, more torsos
---
Any advice on farming scorched with a melee build?
---
Guide to complain about any videogame: Refuse to adapt, demand accommodation.
---
I server hop the random encounter spot south of the oversee camp and I got two of them within 100 or so hoops. 
---
Nah man, I havet one shot anyone lol.  2k+ damage power fist was just as effective as the same fist at 800 damage.  Two hits every time at least.   I stopped keeping my health so low because I would be the only one getting one shot (hence the fist only doing 800 now) .  I don't mind at all though, love the new balance changes though more should come still I think
---
Personally, I'm able to make space.
---
I'll agree with that..if I own the workshop and some demi-god is making a claim, it'd be nice just to politely back away over the border without a scuffle..
---
Somebody got capped a few too many times and didn't learn their lesson.
---
Hey man I feel like this post is extremely misleading? In that video I mostly talk about the TES 25 year anniversary stuff and Fallout 76 coming to steam. I spend about 40 seconds of the video talking about Fallout 76 servers were down, but were now fixed and how it is probably connected to the Morrowind giveaway. 
---
I think only the skin for power armor will they normally state whats gonna go and whats not
---
Thoee were just examples of possible changes they could try. There’s a ton others I’m sure people would love to try, rather than waiting on 1 big update with changes that Bethesda decided on their own that won’t come for months
---
Farm Whitesprings, especially when launching a nuke (you'll get 10+ legendaries just from one run usually), farm special events, and build up your CAMP. Also make some friends if you don't have any; they go a long way to making this game more enjoyable.
---
If you turn on Pacifist, you cannot be harmed even on Survival server, right? 
---
This also goes for the Fasnacht event barret.
---
I ran the parade for the last week instead of playing normally.  At the end, I had 7 level-ups waiting for me (I passed 100 during the event).  Levels don't feel like they come too quickly, but 1 a day isn't at all hard to come up with if you spend any amount of time at it.
---
both games are free to play unfortunately. I'd love it if they would allow us to link our accounts for Fallout 76. Since all other games are coming to steam too there doesn't seem to be any future for the launcher outside of Fallout 76 for me personally.
---
In fo4 i just pretended the pipboy told me everything. I assumed it was the same here but that bubble was burst when i found out this version cpuldnt handle a map
---
The lever is pretty good...
---
Mainly to piss everyone off when i launch a nuke and show up in a hazmat suit. 
---
It grants higher damage resis when in team during pvp and is a life saver for sure. 
---
So join Adventure mode and turn off Pacifist? 
---
I get what your saying, but Every game that has endgame content requires some degree of farming. The point I'm making is that everyone that has this stuff pretty had to farm in this way. Why should it be different for you? 
---
What do you think about separating players by level?  Do you have a compelling argument against putting level 1 players on a different server than level 200 players?  Seems to me that everyone wins if this is implemented.  Then people actually CAN start a new character.  What do you even stand to gain from killing a level 2?  Four whole caps and 2 stimpacks?  Why do you even want them to be in your game?
---
250+ hours here, not one single explosive ANYTHING yet.  The rng gods did grant me a two shot shotgun that's worthless however... I'm so lucky... /yawn
---
is there a way to onvert back to the 'prototype' paint after you mod or put another paint on it?  I only see the 'standard' paint option now... 
---
go back in PVE mode...buy something valuable..keep that in your inventory..then go back on survival..fight like theres no tomorrow..u stil have your valuable item in which you can sell... WIN WIN WIN
---
Why would you bring a lvl 2 into a pvp server to begin with?
---
Top 3 players only mean they are the top TIMED survivors, it doesn't mean they are better or have killed more than anyone else... it just means that they have not died as many times as everyone else. They are smarter players, not necessarily more dangerous or skilled, they just don't die often.
---
Start a new toon in adventure mode where they intended you to do so lol
---
Added: Fertilizer
---
In response to someone commenting on the gear drops.
---
I ended up with a lvl 50 assassins gatling gun on a drop and was actually pissed...I don't want assassins anything as I don't PVP. In fact I end up with a lot of useless assassins gear even though I'd desperately love something different.
---
I ended up putting all the mods on it just because it was the only lvl 50 GG I had. I'd love to find a different GG, but I can't imagine there's much of a market since assassins gear seems to drop a lot. I have several pieces of useless assassins and sentinel armour...just hoping that someday there's player vending so I can get rid of it. I hate the thought of scrapping it or selling since I find so few legendary items these days.
---
The gear drops around a surprising amount, but I've found it rare to actually find something I really want to keep, so PVP players shouldn't have much trouble re-equipping if they were starting over again.
---
(anyone want a 2 star assassins rolling pin?)
---
Just get a good chameleon piece? If you’re a sniper build then you should be crouching most of the time anyways 
---
Just depends on your build. Below level 50, I would just use a two handed axe, or two handed anything. Really good damage, and if you do a power attack you can often take half their health or more with one hit depending on their level.
---
Level 1 to 25 on a server.  Lever 26 to 50 on a server.  Level 50+ on a server.  Then people still get the whole bloodbath experience but at least the playing field is more level than it is now...
---
As I said, it's good if you're focused more on supporting your team on the sidelines, but it really only hurts you if you play solo.
---
Same. 
---
I can this:
---
All factions offer two things directly to the player. A trait and a passive. The passive is a % or flat number to a stat or weapon, etc...
---
The trait is effect that buffs you and nerfs
---
BoS
---
Passive: Optimized. Fusion cores in your armour take 3% less AP for vats. 
---
Trait: Know Your Enemy. All super mutants, ghouls, scorched tale 8% more damage from you. But all humans you hit take 8% less
---
Enclave
---
Well Armed: all energy weapons gain 10 damage. 
---
Superior Race: while partied with other Enclave members you gain damage resistance of X and when alone or with non enclave members you lose damage resistance. 
---
Raiders
---
Junky Soul: when finding scrap you always find extra
---
One More Hit: you can take one more chem and gain extra effects from it. But will crash after it wears out. 
---
Responders
---
Resupply: anytime you run out of something you may find one more of it in the next thing you search. 
---
Team medic: using stimpaks while on a team grants your team 60 extra health and can only be used once every 45 seconds. While not teamed your stimpaks grant no extra health and cost ap
---
Freestates: 
---
Friends of nature: once every 2 minutes while fighting you have a chance to get help from a nearby creature. 
---
Wary of others. While alone you gain 10% damage but being around others reduces it by 20%
---
Nothing too huge but adds to different play styles and the like. Not too overpowering but giving edges when needed. 
---
I just dont seen that being very logical 
---
Ah I meant more getting them to land, I have a decent min maxed power fist build
---
How Pacifist mode can be active on PvP servers eludes me.
---
You’re allowed to feel that way! 
---
Damn honestly reading shit like this sucks, how come you feel that way? 
---
Of course some of us do.  You just don't run into us as much because we're not hunting players.
---
Chameleon mutation is definitely essential. Power armor with a stealth boy mod can be good too since theyre going to see your dot on their hud anyways. Also bloodied weapons are real good with adrenaline reaction. You can keep your health down low with rads and get the strength buff with the endurance perk that buffs strength the more rads you have
---
Who cares how many people you kill if you die?  It is a survival game. 
---
ppl used to always do this at the golf club with their TSEs
---
&gt;Or escape route!
---
ilhhl
---
I got all my legendaries to count doing leader of the pack.  I know its low level but they all counted.
---
Stellar paint job, too. 
---
2 emapths cancel one another out.... And besides if your bloody its not gonna mean much haveing the negitive effect since your one shot away from being paste
---
I just corrected my self you can buy the po skin separately today when ever the shop refreshes itll still be limited time
---
I have a small tree that permeates my camp shack.

I named him Howard.
---
I think the way it is now isn't bad as long as they make sure people can't get shot up right at the start of coming out of the Vault the green zone that was the green shown stay the green zone through both Adventure and PVP modes  train stations  should have green zones making itself if you die and spawn at a train station people cannot have their friends waiting for you at the train station to be shot again
---
I haven't been gaming long enough to know that, I've only seen that being used in Fortnite and Apex and it looks ridiculous af.
---
Or make level difference meaningless. It's annoying when lvl 260 player keeps griefing and dominating with his one hit kill pistol and nothing does damage to him. Same player killed 92 player in hour. It's infuriating.
---
As in real life, I imagine avoiding incoming fire by any means necessary is an outstanding tactic for staying alive.... shocking.
---
Lol some feel otherwise
---
My research dictates that very few actually work, and even then, the WEAPONS ARE STILL UNBALANCED.
---
It’s 3 shots to kill anyone not running sentinel assassin, or 3 hits.
---
Your best options are Instigating, assassin, and sentinel. Most everything else is useless in the world of PvP.
---
Armor points don’t mean anything, damage is based on a percentage or number of the. Enemy’s health.
---
Are you on crack man?  Lay off those stims already. 
---
I'm just tell you for the future. Never use the U-word. I can't tell you why it evokes such a negative response, just that it does in 100% of cases.
---
\- Me, guy who has been both retail and customer service in the past
---
I will try it for some fun and mischief eventually but yeah the regular game is a good challenge 
---
Yall can downvote my post all you want but you know theres facts here. 
---
I have only recently started going to the golf club after hitting level 40 and switching to melee; I used to get annihilated by the ghouls before that, so it was new to me.
---
Because I've already played the whole game though on adventure.  I want to play it again with a new experience.  One with fear and tension and actually being scared of something for once.  I want to see another low level guy and not be certain he's going to kill me and try to approach with caution.  To have a new experience and to enjoy the game with a new feature implemented.  As it is, there is no chance for new players to enjoy this mode at all.  There's no way for seasoned players to try it with a new character.  How do you not see that this could be a desirable aspect of the game for some people?  It still let's you bring fully geared and high level players onto the mode and your experience will not change much, except all the easy pickins aren't there for you.  You actually have to fight someone who might be your equal.
---
Yeah I do, seem to have accumulated 4 chameleon left arms of various armor types lol. I wear that and the rest unyielding. 
---
‘Why do you even want them to be in your game?’
---
Fortnite 
---
No... there isnt even slap damage on survival. 
---
May I ask why your bed is out in the weather? Farming diseases? Or just don't use the bed?
---
Very nice. 
---
I hate when I see these posts and the persons name is withheld.  These are the kind of people I want to follow around and when I see them picking on people just start tossing handfuls of plasma grenades at them or invite the people they are picking on to my team so I can blast 'em.
---
Ah I got you. All I do is kill scorched while I wait for them to land, bring them to a more open space, they have a higher tendency to land there. 
---
That's what logging out is for.
---
What will happen if you set it to the border, is people will stand just outside, wait for an opening, and step in to snipe, then back out if needed.
---
What's needed is a short timer on the PvP, so that if you just run outside the border, you're vulnerable for 1 minute or so.  If you fast travel away, you'll still be vulnerable, but only for a short time.  I'm not sure if anyone else can tell you're pvp-flagged for that time, I don't recall anything like that...if not, you'd be pretty safe if you zoned away.
---
Right but everyone is entitled to their opinion, as long as they acknowledge that others do too
---
It's called bunny hopping. Some servers will ban you from playing on it in other games if you do it. 
---
Looks real, nice
---
No happening because Bethesda has a taste unlike this sub.
---
Then play it but expect for people to come by and try and kill you ...that right there is the challenge we all want. I fully expect to die being 150 and i fully expect the same on my lvl25 . play in areas most wont. And if you need to travel goto adventure travel then load into survival. Idk may i dont feel making such drastic changes are going to stop someone from coming by and killing you over and over.

Pro tip, go to adventure mode, go where you want, swap back.   This tip is only for those that don't like to get killed at train stations.  Can take it a step further and just stay on adventure lol
---
Interesting. Weird but interesting. Thanks
---
What is your psn name so that I can get it
---
Ah...I have been hearing about bunny hopping in Apex and how they're planning to patch it out, but I haven't played Apex in a while so I didn't know about it.
---
I already did that.  I want a NEW EXPERIENCE that currently is completely impossible to enjoy.  Why would I want to go level up another character when I already have a level 185 that I could bring to survival?  The point is that I want to play SURVIVAL mode.  Not DEATHMATCH mode.  If everyone just brings full pvp characters, that's fine, but is anyone doing events?  Quests?  No.  Just killing each other.  That doesn't appeal to me.  What DOES appeal to me is having something new to do in the game, even if it's just playing everything again with a new twist.
---
Hell i love that feeling ovlf not knowing whos around the corner whos gonna snipe me out of the trees. Its so refreshing then standing there with a bounty waitng for a fight
---
This happens to me occasionally too. It’s bizarre. Sometimes white spring bots will just drop dead as I pass them and the rest don’t get angry at me so I assume it’s not registering that I am attacking them, they just see me and die. 
---
I'd be fine with that as long as I can choose to go to a higher level server. I also think they also need to cap the cap loss for higher level players to stop everyone from muling their $.
---
Got it, thank you for your feedback. 
---
I guess my instigating Shishkebab will be my
---
Go to. 
---
Are damage reduction perks (evasive/blocker/etc) useless as well?
---
That is one of event that never happened to any server i joined. But i had hunter/hunted event with 7ppl. Maybe i am extra unlucky.
---
Then maybe they should add to adventure mode not take away from pvp how about that
---
Bethesda really needs to increase the caps limit as players grow. For a level 300+ player like myself and many early starters the daily 200 caps limit per vendor and 25k total limit are a joke and is killing the momentum. 
---
never thought of that..I'm definitely a PvP amateur..a timer is a better idea :)
---
Yeah. Regular torso shots won't do it against a sentinel build. You have to head shot and make those crits count. 
---
I’d be 100% in! 
---
Server instability?
---
What do you mean cosplay, this is just an in game model smh 
---
Sure, if a lvl 1 wants to be in a game with level 200, fine.  Let them.  But not the other way around.  It just seems stupid.
---
Oh how imagining your rage while you have to choose which junk to destroy makes me so happy for some reason
---
Thanks for the reply! So my character is currently a stealth sniper and have begun transforming into a stealth full auto gunner w/ two handed melee weapons? Figured I may as well make a bit more use of my stealth, would using the endurance perk give me enough damage output when used in conjunction with adrenal reaction to prevent having to sink too many points into strength? Want the two handed to be a secondary as opposed to a primary 
---
the atomic paint job for combat armor that makes it covered in blood takes away the blue BoS paint job and makes it the standard tan with white star
---
Right lol i do acknowledge others points. So assuming i dont is rude. But point aside add to adventure mode dont take away from survival. Add these high ex rewards and extra events to adventure mode and refresh its feel dont remove the fun from our endless slaughter on survival lol if anything add more fun dont take away. 
---
Thats hard on consoles, event with vats, we are doomed haha
---
lmfao.
---
There should have been 2 endings to it, they live or they die...
---
+1 for using the protest signs
---
Thanks, I just saw someone responded to another player saying you can survive by turning on Pacifist, so it’s really not an option then (which is good). 
---
this is what I was wondering - thanks! ^^ looks like there is no way to get the proto paint back... 
---
So taking away the level 10s is not appealing to you?  You don't want to play people who can actually compete with you, huh?  And how is this taking anything away from survival?  I'm proposing we keep everything exactly as it is, except group players by level.  I don't see how that affects your experience as a level 100+ at all
---
I have extensive experience in PvP...in the original WoW battelgrounds (2005?) :P  It's really not my thing, I've just seen it done badly dozens of times.
---
Why doesn't this thoughtful response have more up votes?
---
its not usable with the BoS coloring. it changes it to the standard tan with the white star on the chest. luckily you keep the BoS mods
---
i know right ...  I have to buy from the market to get anything of Value - last week I DID finally get a 3 star Furious Explosive Combat Shotgun, that Dropped from the Uranium fever event .. I about lost my Mind ..  
---
Can you place more than 2 mines? Mine seem to always blow up if I place more than 2, haven’t tested it in a while tho.
---
Hey man, I may not be able to get on all the time, but I’m willing to join.
---
Thx man
---
I leveled two toons up to 15 in the survival servers yesterday.  Fun as hell imo.  Hopping back in now.
---
I used to feel that way but they became rare after I got a Deathclaw gauntlet that would one shot them...since then its like the AI is thinking 'why bother'
---
Put something over the trees or bushes. Itll tear them down. Unless it's a perminant tree. Then move your base.
---
I have a group, we've been running for about a decade together. Always looking for recruit and friends
---
My commando + explosive character. GLs are more durable than missile launchers and the ammo is lighter. After a certain level the GL just becomes a fun little "murder a bunch of low levels" weapon (workshop defense and horde mode are great for them).
---
"I don't like challenges so if I need to travel I go to adventure mode and travel and make sure I'm nice and safe then get back into survival mode."
---
If you don't see the problems with this exploitative approach you are blind
---
How to do that ? Can’t even get to my desktop
---
And I think this point wouldn’t be as big of an issue if the end game in adventure had content added prior to survival. If adventure had more going on currently, I think survival wouldn’t be nearly as controversial
---
Yeah, it appears for the challenges where it asks you to "kill" creatures that only the fatal blow counts. Tested this out with a friend on the recent kill 25 creatures while intoxicated challenge. Only the last hit counted. 
---
Played over 300 levels, of which 98%+ were at whitesprings. Got two (!) good drops, not god rolls but good ones. 
---
Instead of making the grind worse, add more weapons over time, new legendary effects, skins and mods.
---
If I was ever hyped for a game it was this one, but I'm about to give up.
---
I’m offering 600 caps for it like my message said for the lever
---
Honestly I don't hate that. I like the standard tan but I also enjoy the protection from BoS 
---
Have they fixed it yet ?
---
1 star legendaries count.  I got 14 yesterday leveling noobs doing leader of the pack.
---
I know right?
---
Oh definitely! I made a similar post above - if adventure had more gojng on from an end game perspective right now, it wouldn’t be nearly as big of an issue
---
Mario was used to jump to avoid danger. Then quake 3 arena was crazy with that. And counterstrike had it's own maps using bunny hopping when i was little child.
---
You should simply not have duplicates, if you rank a card to max rank you should be able to equip it and select its level.  So if its a 3 star rank and its at max and I have 2 points left in agility I should be able to equip it and select "Use two ranks" and be done.  There is no reason to have multiple of the same card if it were setup this way.

yah im not to tore up since the mods stayed at least. but i was really hoping id get to keep that BoS paint job.
---
I drop everything afterwards snd only keep one of each bullet-type weapon so when you run outbof bullets if one weapon, you have another.   
---
I have never been that high til the hlitch today.
---
Plus, it wont ket me destroy the glitch-added armor.
---
So i performed a FULL SHUTDOWN on my xbox hoping the glitch will be gone.
---
If nit, hope ladydevann or valseek can fix my game.
---
They’ll fix it, just  submit a ticket and be polite. People are not perfect, ya know?
---
I have one question for you.  What is your reason, as a level 150 player, for keeping level 1 players on your server?
---
He might have had Pacifist mode turned on by accident, happened to me the first time I entered the survival server.
---
It wouldnt matter to me if you were in there or not ive killed higher levels with my 25 then i have with my 50 on many occasions . but having level separated play areas and or dedicated servers is silly i dont wanna constantly fight lvl 50s i like the challange of taking down high level prey. And honestly with my lvl 15 be pump action ill kill anyone lvl 5-30 one shot over and over so grouping by lvl isnt going to stop players from ruining your day
---
You don’t need TSE guns to mop up people. Damage is a percentage of another target’s health. 
---
It’s whoever has the best fire rate handmade (other weapons are either less percentage damage or lower fire rate), and whoever has Chameleon or sentinel.
---
Also, when the rewards for killing somebody are so high, why wouldn’t you try to kill people?
---
I play just fine.
---
I play on 3 toons a low level mid and a high thats my reasoning 
---
It says right on it that it's a beta. I always love people who play 200 hours and say the game is total garbage. If it was total garbage you would have stopped playing roughly 195 hours ago.
---
Even weirder is it seems ballistic and energy resistances do nothing. Same for damage reduction perk cards. This is all mainly anecdotal observations we have been making, but I have been sniped with an explosive shotgun while using fire proof and being left with similar health values to my one shot build. I could have sworn taking a lot less damage on the old adventure servers from player explosives.
---
"Harder to kill" for 3 minutes - "sleepy after" for 30.
---
Then why he didn't take damage?
---
Agreed entirely 
---
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: this guy is the absolute BEST. He’s as fair as they come - I can’t imagine anyone else as my go-to-guy. You’re a real one, mate! 
---
PvP was the last thing I got to and it's much more fun when it's people who want to engage in PvP rather than some poor guy that's trying to get 5.56 at the munitions factory. I'm looking forward to vault raids, but this is what we have right now. 
---
I don't get your grandstanding about hiding your caps and aid. Most people put their junk in stash so they don't lose it on death, but that's not exploitative, now is it? I'm currently playing at 12k caps and I treat aid like I do junk. I try to carry as little as I need to because anything you carry has the potential to drop. I know plenty of people carry around loads of junk in adventure mode, but I always thought that was an easy way to lose lots of junk. There's still challenge and there's still tension. The amount of people playing with 0 aid and 0 caps is pretty low. Once they get to that point, they pretty much can't do anything and just have to respawn at CAMP or vault 76, not to mention they're playing with 50% less damage to other players. If you don't believe me, go hop into survival and see how many people aren't dropping caps.
---
This play mode is pretty lacking and could use some polish. This would be a perfect place to have a faction system so you have different factions vying for control to rebuild Appalachia. That would seem, from a story perspective, consequential. However, very little of what the player does in this world has lasting consequences, unlike FO4, New Vegas, or FO3. That's a weakness of the whole game - not survival mode. 
---
Time Lord Technology.... just sayin
---
Found em 
---
All due respect, if it got 200 hours out of you, couldn’t have been that disgraceful (?)
---
Most of the time I don’t run weightless sentinel, I run 4 Unyielding sentinel and one chameleon sentinel.
---
I might recommend as a cheaper stealth armor getting a hold of one chameleon sentinel and the rest just be whatever sentinel you can get.
---
I wasn't in my base hiding and kept going after him. He kept coming after me.
---
That’s how I play the game of real life.
---
Vats headshot once or twice or even three times in quick succession should do it for most guns and against most builds, even ass ones, unless your damage output is underperforming for some reason. I have a simple 1* bloodied lever (running at about 2/3rd hp) that melts players with a few quick shots
---
Best bet would be to get all assassins except like 1 or 2 pieces of Chameleon. That's what I would do at least.
---
Permanent, but rare.  That's what it should be, it seems pretty clear it should have been in the game from the start, since they were telling us about Helvetia masks during the documentary.
---
And it seems like the robots of Helvetia should be carrying on the tradition year-round, because they're dumb robots who don't really know any better beyond the scope of their programming.  Really no other reason to venture there. 
---
A level 200 in this game is technically level 50.
---
Extra levels essentially just let you have more spec options alongside losing more caps from pvp.
---
Google 
---
I dont know. I have been at work and I already purchased it, so it doesnt show it for me
---
If you take the paint off does it restore the BoS paint?
---
They aren't fixing it.  They made it so if you have more than 1500 pounds you have to destroy everything to get below that limit.  So no transfering your I'll gotten gains to toons or friends.
---
No. Some of their posts were similar.
---
Cool, but I think I only have like 1 salt. What are the mats needed for shielded casual?
---
Well then like i said before go back to adventure mode and stay off survival. If you dont like being a lamb to the slaughter 
---
I love dying before a loading screen is finished.
---
I love being farmed for all of my medicine.
---
I love being farmed for all my caps because I can't put them in my stash.
---
I love being camped, but not being able to go anywhere else because I don't have caps.
---
I love having my base torn to pieces because turrets are worthless.
---
I love having to hop to another server hoping that it doesn't happen again.
---
I love being level 30, tailed by a death squad of level 150+ players.
---
I want to like Survival, but I just fucking can't,
---
Pacifist has never kept you from being harmed. It simply kept you from initiating PvP by accidentally shooting someone (or someone's turret). That's why the removal of slap damage was a big deal with the most recent patch.
---
Yes, it seems like the tracker is only counting star level legendaries. 
---
I'm only level 40 right now so I'm not sure how that works, in that case. Once you're 50+ then its fair game but 50s+ can be rewarded for killing 40 - 49 but 39 and under should not reward them anything.
---
8 is pretty good compared to a 1. ;)   
---
My first "max rifleman" build took bunches of strength perks and neglected the luck stat entirely. It took him a long time to get any kind of momentum with random legendaries. That said, your list includes a lot of the "always" events, knowledge of which may have contributed to my impression of "Getting more" with my high luck character (which was a later build, and thus benefitted from knowing a bit more where to look/farm). Hell, with Faschnacht running, you could pick up a one or 2 star level 35 legendary almost hourly if the Sloth didn't glitch...   
---
"Early builds" (i.e. from Beta or first character for a new player) often neglect the luck stat in favor of maxxing a weapon build or carry weight perks. I have already deleted several characters as I figured out how high level stats worked, tweaked and planned out builds.    
---
It's also pretty hard to bump up luck early, as the low level luck perks are not terribly enticing. Yes, you can cross-pick without choosing a special that matches, but that only works for a level or so.   
---
So, really, I have No idea if it works. And folks who run Mutated Bloodied or Crit builds are already bumping luck for the Starched Genes et al. Wouldn't it be nice if Bethesda would just sort of tell us? ("Hey, want more legendaries? Bump up your LUCK stat" or "hey, don't worry, we all have the same chance regardless of luck".) I still think the existence of luck enhancing legendaries and other items and perks MUST have some effect, as we know it doesn't allow you to equip any extra perks. It can't just be crit regen... can it? ;) 
---
500hours here, game is garbage. Jokin, but yeah it could be better, also comunity could be better and world could be better, even galaxy could be better.
---
Ah bunny hopping, brings back memories of quake one and two.  Except I used rocket jumping instead, might as well damage myself and fly while killing the bejeesus out of people.  I feel old now.
---
I’m guessing it’s 1400 atoms right? Guess I’m getting the bundle then lol.
---
Because it’s a new game mode and it should be more accessible. It’s just bad design if it is. WoW did that sort of stuff in vanilla, where only a literal handful out of millions of players got to see the very end game content.
---
The word is you have to make the killing blow 
---
I think I saw you on the security cam, you need to activate sneak mode and stand very very still.
---
They are not complaints, they are suggestions. You are the only person whining about your skilless VATS build becoming obsolete Mr.AutoAim. You admit it. You're they only one trying to convince me that Auto Aim requires skill or should be allowed in Survival mode. I never said it wasn't fair, I just said it doesn't belong. Furthermore, I haven't even touched survival mode to have any complaints. As I clearly stated they are simply suggestion you don't agree with....Good for you, I don't care what you like or not.
---
I hate what these kids games are doing to gaming, especially since they'll be shaping games and perceptions for years to come
---
Itll be 1000 atoms the inside the vault has an updates on Wednesday of whats gonna be on sale and what not 
---
damn that is a great recreation wish i had one now :)
---
I've been by myself for all these kills. It was definitely me making the killing blow.
---
No to formatting? Well if you’re too stubborn to let us help you get your point across then I have no faith that you’ll listen to any advice on how to properly build your character for PvP. Just stop complaining and don’t play if you’re not having fun, do you play on XB1? You can roll with me to see how to get the element of surprise on people and I’ll give you some tips on your build.
---
A couple hundred hours is a pretty good run for garbage... 
---
I actually wouldn’t even mind it if I got some indication when someone got within the little radar circle on the map.  Just so I could get ready to fight.  But as it stands you can either get in a hideout and hard scope (boring) or you just get killed from behind.
---
I suspect answer B is the correct one.  Bethesda really seems to want players to PvP.  There's almost always a "claim workshop" on the list of daily or weekly challenges.
---
I don't get instigating and the fuss over it. It's useless in pvp because no one is running around at full health. Everyone has at least a couple points of rads.
---
I wasn't expecting to drop that many. Sure drop 10 each death whatever but my first death in survival took a giant chunk of my meds and that's just annoying.
---
There should be a bank system. You carry the caps like junk, dying causes you to drop some. Going to train stations allows you to bank them, and going to other train stations allows you to withdraw for purchases. The bank should also have an unlimited count of storage. 
---
Well that sucks. I was planning on grinding them all out tomorrow when I’m home. 
---
Every comment getting downvoted for telling the truth....
---
Holy cow, that's awesome. Are there any other spaces like this around the map?
---
&gt; After they ate me, the gave me a bunch of junk and aid and a tour of their swamp murder home, which was lovely.
---
Sharing is caring. 
---
You realize I was referring to what YOU said, right?  You're clearly not going to ever understand anyone's perspective but your own.  Great way to debate.
---

Yea this feature is so good, you don't have to look how someone is murdering you.

Waking up dead is so peaceful and great!

---
Yes, and Presumably yes.
---
Presumably yes, because armor appears to be worthless but armor penetration seems to make my damage more consistent.
---
This is more of a suspicion, because I only had time for a few tests.
---
You can try things, but the best option appears to be however much hits you can get on target with a handmade in VATS.
---
Here’s some maths genius. Shotgun shoots 8 pellets, two shot shotgun shoots 9 pellets, 9th pellet is doing ((shotgun dmg)/(8))*(.25) for a whopping 3% more dmg from a two shot shotgun over a regular shotgun.
---
Literally any other legendary perk would be better. Like you said. Maths.
---
So why can't my BPPistol do it with 1,800 damage? If you are 100% HP, you live. If 75% or lower, sure you can kill them. They were already hurt.
---
I couldn't agree more with you! Honestly after seeing everybody's reviews here and on YouTube I'm avoiding that's survival mode due to all the grief killing and the fact that is not a survival mode at all. It is totally a deathmatch. I want to be able to roam the wasteland always looking over my shoulder and looking out for other players but if I'm on the map too long I think it is a terrible idea that I would pop up on the scoreboards just because I'm trying to do missions and quests.
---
Yeh I gotta take a loot at how my damage is affected by getting rid of unyielding.
---
Imma come find you later and fill your camp with scarecrows.
---
That's not nice of you to call me Stubborn when I don't understand what everyone is talking about. I'm on the PlayStation 4 and I can decently play the game. This post is about how the survival mode is unbalanced.
---
That's what I was saying the whole in regards to a new character. I feel like you have to make a new character for Survival. Makes for a new experience and more replayability considering your not loading into a new mode all beefed up. Alot more terrifying coming out of the vault like that. We need Fallout 4 survival mode in 76
---
Yeah I don't get it. Everyone deserves an opinion. I think the standoffish way they replied is probably the reason though. 
---
Not really. Haven't played since December and came back because survival sounded cool but of course they made it super easy to troll in.
---
1000 atoms? Not that bad. Is it permanent or no? And will it be in sale throughout the days?
---
My logic is based off of probability and statistics.
---
For spawn camping at train stations?
---
There are also a couple of beaver dam areas.  In the NE of Watoga, due north of Watoga, etc.
---
Do a full run, don't just stick to Watoga. Start at Whitesprings ---&gt; Huntersville -----&gt; West Tek -----&gt; Watoga (and the Emergency services building) ----&gt; The Train yard ----&gt; the areas around fissure prime and back to Whitesprings and server hop. 
---
Mind if I ask where u got ur unyielding sentinel?
---
.
---
After playing the new mode and sleeping on it, I'm in love. Can't wait to see what changes they do and how it will grow.
---
Survival mode should be survival mode. You die, you stay dead. No respawn no nothing. Anything you have drops for looters, your camp is now up for grabs, etc. Make it so players on the same level are put up together on a server, no XP from tasks to level up, you only level up based on how many "days" you survive. Every so many levels you get moved to the next server with other the same levels. 
---
This is a much more reasonable response than I've been seeing.  So thanks for that.  I've seen a lot of posts of people who dumped all their caps before going into survival and how that's basically an exploit.  What about people who log out to go back to adventure, relax, eat, sell shit, fix guns and armor, then casually go back to survival when they're ready?  Do you consider this a problem at all?  If this mode is going to have any integrity there needs to be some way to avoid this kind of stuff otherwise it's literally just a place to go and kill or die.  And while some people seem to want COD in fallout, it feels like there is so much more potential here for a distinctly fallout experience when  instead we get gta online
---
put a door mat over it.
---
It helps after you kill an enemy once, you lose rads and regenerate all health upon death.
---
You have until  the 31 to buy the power armor skin seperate 
---
My thing is idc about what the low level players want. Thats what adventure mode is for lol go up further on your post and read the comments between me and another guy. Its simple add more to adventure mode and leave survival alone. Give use endgame player our survival and leave you to your endless grind on adventure mode. Plain and simple give adventure is long over due endgame content and leave use to lilling people in survival since thats what its really for
---
Sneak player with 500hours here. Before some patch i was able to stab enemies in face with small weapons, without being noticed. 
---
Later bethesda fucked up and you had danger even when you was out of combat.
---
Thanksfully they fixed it, but not at all, because when i get spoted i can't "re-crouch" to lose agro and do sneak multipled damage.(21agility, some legendary with + sneak, all sneaking perks)
---
So sneak sniper = good
---
Sneak melee = not good
---
I built into the trees near the tattoo shop and Vault-tec university and half the tree invaded my space so I made it into an outdoor deck with branches 
---
TL;DR-A small personal review of new vs old game mode. 
---
Personally, I'll just stick with adventure mode. Tried Survival last night. Just wanted to complete a quest, but thought I'd at least try the new mode. Had to cross 1/4 of the map crouched and hidden in the bush with a gun out, avoiding major landmarks to get to the destination. Hearing the pings and seeing the messages almost constantly that "Such-and-such just killed So-and-so". Then got all paranoid while searching the building that i would just find what i was looking for, get killed,and have to restart ages back at a station,lose half my shit, and have to do it again. For me, it took away all the fun i had been having in the game. Exploring new places, finding hidden spots, taking the time to find files and messages and soaking in the story of what had happened and the fun of coming across a random person,most of whom have been pretty great. Even if it was just throwing each other a casual wave and moving on. The last Fasnacht event i was at, there was a guy at the end who you could tell was a griefer cause he kept shooting at the players to start PvP. Gave me great pleasure to give him the big thumb down emote. Lol. 
---
That's pretty cannon 
---
I legit thought he used a real sledgehammer XP
---
Try quake, that is bunny hopping on acid, where you literally flick yourself across the map by slightly turning your head from left to right so you go flying at 3x the speed of everyone else, then get a head shot with a railgun without zoom in because it didn't exist yet.
---
ill have to test that when i can. i had put the paint on and went about my normal grind before logging. that is a excellent question
---
Yeah I realized myself it must have been on a bug on that server last night.
---
It should be dirty water in the bowl. If it has been used it should be toxic water for 10 minutes (so you know what you just drank).  Using the toilet should increase hunger and temporarily amplify the Plague Walker mutation.
---
Umm...  My Bloodied Sniper one-shots players every time with my lever action; sounds like you need to tweak your build/gear.
---
My junk components i keep are 150 of each except wood which i keep at 400 in my stash at all times since i dont do much crafting. 
---
Then i try to give away, free, everything else to other players.
---
Then visit maybe 3 train stations for 600 caps then scrap the rest of my unwanted weapons and apparel and junk.  
---
Go to my stash to stock up on components.
---
Then i drop a huge bag at either Whitesprings or Overseers camp for low-level players.
---
When i am in power armor upload world load, i am overencumbered 750/405.
---
When i exit my power armor, my carry weigh is 205.   
---
When i get back in, it is 305.   I am always between 750 and 850.
---
Today is the first time i maxed out due to glitch.
---
And now I'm trying to fix it.
---
I played this game on a brand new out of the box PS4 Pro.
---
My experiences were pretty boiler-plate when you ask anybody I know who played this game.
---
My friend who convinced me to get it to play with him couldn't even finish the main questline he got so sick of Framerate dips (down to Zero) and getting bluescreened on a constant basis just trying to perform simple actions like opening the stash or going through a door. Even after their first two patches totaling over 100gb, it wasnt fixed even remotely. 
---
Game kept crashing, freezing, refusing to load textures, and becoming unplayable and requiring hard restart if GOD FORBID you accidentally opened your pipboy before the game had 187 seconds to register that you fast travelled, load you in, then load in actual functionality.
---
No, it was not issues with my ISP, if you knew anything about technology you would know that framerate and bluescreens have little to nothing to do with connection. 
---
And I know that I get such negative reactions to my negative feedback and opinions on this game for one reason alone, which is that anybody who reacts negatively to my opinions is typically a hardcore defender of this game. This sub is full of 'em. It actually amazes me anybody has anything positive to say about this game when it performs so absolutely terribly on consoles.
---
I don't care about karma on reddit. Making new accounts takes all of 2 minutes. Keep those downvotes coming.
---
It being explosive doesn’t make a difference if it staggers or not.
---
And you won’t ever kill a sentinel guy with a explosive shotgun unless he is extremely dumb.
---
In fact explosive shotguns will deal exactly 0, yes ZERO dmg to you if you know the basic most basic parts of the game and PvP, but most people here are too stupid to look into that and are getting murdered by these noob guns left and right.
---
You probably didn't hit him??. Don't aim where he is, but where he's going to be? It took me 15 minutes to kill a guy running sentinel at a workshop. Sometimes it seemed like HE wasn't taking  any damage, but I got him in the end. Tse already got nerfed to hell because snowflakes like you. Every advantage in this game has a weakess.. someone's already said in this sub "git gud" don't complain for the game to be made easier. 
---
Stop copying and pasting reply's. If you can't be bothered to type, I can't be bothered to engage with you 🖕
---
Haven't been in survival mode as of yet, so no I haven't been capped a few too many times and there was no lesson to be learned. Not even interested in it in the slightest, just suggesting things that would make it more balanced for everyone so I may consider the game mode in the future.
---
Do events like uranium fever, but dont take aid and caps with you, cause you gonna die there.
---
Read other posts on this. Most have someone commenting that its only counting legendary with star.
---
Ah I see, ah well - I’m assuming bloodied chameleon build is best? 
---
Yeah I'm starting to think that must have been the case, although it was multiple people shooting at me lol, maybe all of them didn't realize they had to turn it off
---
That’s cool. Do limited timed items go on sale or nah.
---
Have you tried booting up in safe mode?
---
They should not have included weekly rewards yet either. Forced to participate in an extremely poorly thought out and executed pvp mode if you want that stuff, shortsighted and disappointing.  
---
I'm continually growing more and more suspicious that the devs are LARPing Vault-Tec program architects and this is a test to see just how much utter bullshit a video game player base will put up with.
---
Not that i know of and it would say if it did but its only here for a week so grab it while you can
---
Or why don’t the devs actually balance the combat?
---
Same here, with whiskey. Have downed three bottles both self-made (and properly fermented) and found. Done sneak attacks with guns, melee and unarmed with no effect.
---
Hmm, is it doable with only train station fast travel?
---
I just want to be clear. Is it really the case that the mixed drinks (i.e., tick blood tequila sunrise, lead champagne mimosa) have *reduced* beneficial effects compared to the alcohol (tick blood tequila, lead champagne) required to craft them?
---
I don't think you lose all rads on death, but only some...
---
However you have to respond to fire, there is not real danger
---
Others are saying it must be a 1-3 star legendary.  No stars don’t count. 
---
Much more than I anticipated! I was furious at that moment of realization that damn near all my aid was gone. Just goes to show you how prep can help go a long way in preservation. (aka, reading the patch notes). 
---
I rarely see them. Maybe stop going to places that are direct spawns of them? 
---
A couple pieces from in game (one from an ingame trade and another from farming)
---
Two more from a kind user on discord who just gave me them
---
And more than five from trading on r/market76
---
https://imgur.com/a/B1nAGjm
---
&gt; But if they a cross the map, I might accept, let them fast travel, give them a minute, then kick them .. I am a solo player so generally don't care for teaming up, but I don't mind helping people fast travel.
---
That's so nice of you. But it's an absolute hassle to find the player that invited you on the map; by the time I finally find their dots, the invite will have gotten auto-rejected.
---
Those Fasnacht invites could still have been griefers, though: they know you're committed to stay there for 10 to 20 minutes, that gives them all the time they need to reduce your camp to ashes...
---
Get some fresh air 
---
They are sold in the Enclave vendors.  Not very expensive from the NPCs.  
---
I got sentinel and instagasting hunting rifle, doing good. Bloodied may be better. Automatic rifles have better potencial also. When i miss shot i may have hard time especialy in PvP.
---
Also, stagger is a hard counter as sentinel only works "when standing still".
---
Pain train 
---
tank killer 
---
one gun army 
---
enforcer  
---
All of the perks above provide a chance to stagger and pain train is a guarantee (iirc).  
---
It should be noted that combining any of the weapon perks to get a stagger works best with high rof/automatic weapons.
---
Fabulous! What platform?
---
isnt it the best?
---
I've not had the same level of success at West Tek. I've had runs, where I've left empty handed, save for the 5.56 ammo I'm usually in need of.
---
That makes me wet 
---
Can’t acces safemode trough the startup options because the pc needs to restart for it and automatically try’s to repair :/
---
This seems like a better long term solution to me than locking characters in survival. I'm not against survival characters, but I don't think it really solves much in the long run. 
---
I'm not going to lie I thought a very similar thought.
---
 Almost every concept of the new survival servers just seemed so off base to me.  Very Vault-Tec like.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if the "Top 3" were the players with the most kills in their current life. I think the map is too big for there to be absolutely no indicator of where to find PvP if you want it. And players would be much more hesitant to kill if they knew that doing so might put them on the map, but those that do want to PvP would have no trouble finding it. Right now the only people being punished are the ones who want to quest and level, while griefers are being rewarded. 
---
Get this guy some Nukashine!
---
I am the guy who loves to run to locations rather than fast travel. Thats why I see so many of them.
---
What if you go in your pip boy and decline the event?
---
I amazed with how little they changed for this mode. Basically they just tweaked few already existing values and created a leaderboard system. The whole thing was not tested in any way. They just let us do their job. I will never pay for another Bethesda game after this shit show.
---
i'd hardly call that  insecurity dude has set limits to the amount of time he wants to spend getting curb stomped in their leisure time and instead enjoy that time "productively" (its subjective)
---
\+upvote for "REAL gamers" (unless you are 13-24 white urban and male your not a real gamer amiright?)
---
 /s for those who need it
---
maybe thats it.. i just need to get meself a deathclaw..
---
I server hopped a few times and everything got fixed
---
I think fast travel to your own camp is a nice compromise, but I agree. Ditch the train stations. 
---
While I'm all over the idea of this, as well as the proposed idea of using a Bank and including an Auction House (that was a great thing that I loved about WoW)...
---
**OPTION 1:**  
---
Why not combine lore? :) We have so much at our disposal that could be repurposed for this sort of thing: MAIL BOXES! There are the big drop-off boxes in many locations around Waste Virginia, and I know in FO4 we could build Mailboxes at our establishments. New Vegas had Couriers whose job was to deliver high end valuables... ;) ;)  
---
*(I know, Couriers won't technically be a thing for a long time, but I don't remember if FO:NV ever provided lore on when and where they originated, did it?)*
---
I mean this could be used to deliver items to literally anyone, not just your other characters. It could easily have limitations, such as where you're allow to transfer a huge amount of weight between characters on one account, but cross-account "Packages" are limited to say 50 pounds (or whatever the heaviest, single object is, as I know some of the modded heavy weapons I've seen eclipse 40lbs).
---
Now, the issue with having it work across player accounts does pose a slight issue given Bethesda decided to make us name our characters, but those names show up no-where else in the game and we're all just "account names" to each other. Ideally, we'd know each character's name, and so when we interacted with a Drop-Off Mailbox we'd get a Trade Menu, and we type in the Character name of the recipient (yes I realize this is complicated with consoles, so something-something-onscreen-keyboard?). 
---
Less-ideally is it gets delivered to the Account Name, and the package contents can be viewed by any of the characters on that account, leaving it up to them to determine which one they want to accept (loot) it on. 
---
Not-so-ideally, to make it easier to integrate for console players (short of the OSK method), would be to only allow sending to Friends, Teammates, or names on the Recent list. This would eliminate the need to type a name, and admittedly remove the issue of mis-typing or mis-remembering someone's account name (naturally, measures to name-check would be implemented to prevent attempts and lost items due to untimely disconnects). It would also make it easier to sent thing since a context-menu option could be added (just as Report Player was), to the effect of "Send Package". However, that takes away of bit of the immersion of going to a Drop-off Box to send stuff :P
---
Either way, using "packages" and a "mailing system" would be lore friendly given each of our characters are really just another Vault Dweller from 76. Only difference is that we personally can never meet them... lol
---
**OPTION 2:**  
---
At the main-menu, in the Characters selection menu, we're allowed to enter a "Item Transfer" menu where we can select two of the characters and it'll open a Trade menu but with a couple tabs: Inventory, and Stash. That way we aren't having to sort through an even more-massive list of items to find what we want to transfer, and from there we have the usual category choices (Weapons, Armor, Aid, etc). 
---
The ideal method, would be to really make something snazzy, where we actually load into a small world (just a room, say the vault commons area) where all of our characters are presented, idling as they do, with their stash box next to them. You would, I guess, be a Mr Handy or Ms Maid ^((or Vertibot for any who identify as an Attack Helicopter?)). From there you just loot and transfer the item around as you want. 
---
I'd love to say that for this to happen we'd need it to download our saves to run client-side so that there's no risk of disconnection, but sadly that isn't going to fly on account of being wwwwaaayyy too exploitable. Duping shouldn't be a concern though as there'd be zero reason to enable Drop, and so it could be set like Atom Shop items, to "Destroy" (yea, the avalanche of Fasnacht masks indicates otherwise, but this wouldn't be a huge world with tons of things being computed and odd windows of opportunity heh)
---
So there's my 2 caps worth on this topic!
---
A safe zone and reworking how players appear on the map are great suggestions. With player vending coming soon, safe zones in survival will be essential. Honestly, I would like most of the forest to be a pvp free zone aside from the workshops. It would also be nice if inside the train stations were a safe zone so people can access vendors. The way it stands now, it is impossible to play entirely on survival because you can't do simple things such as sell your junk without looking over your shoulder.
---
This calls to put on Responders Cop outfit on and make sure to keep newcomers safely leave Vault! What a grand roleplaying idea! 
---
Yes. I think the thought is the straight liquor is diluted with mixers. But you get 2 or 3 mixed drinks for one straight. So with the tick blood tequila both hunger and health are regenerated. If you make margs or sunrises you get either health or hunger but you craft 3 drinks out of 1 tequila. 
---
nice! better than the shit bethesda peddles for $200.00 price tag
---
I don't disagree, but I usually see those camps destroyed
---
From what I've had explained to me it *is* working but the problem is you fast travel into location way faster than your game actually loads you in. Therefore it might as well not even be working.
---
Hmm... That's a good question. Well, Whitesprings, Huntersville and West Tek are all fairly close to the Whitesprings Station, and the other half of the run is close to Watoga station
---
Dev room was moved to a separate world space a couple patches ago and is no longer accessible in game, soooo.....
---
There was a mod for that
---
What
---
Have the team sniper using empath. All the seen and fighting folks have damage resist. The sniper that would die easy anyways is a little more squishy, but who cares.
---
Just respawn somewhere else and kill them by taking a safe approach up to them
---
Pc, but I figure it should stay similar
---
Ahh, okay! That makes more sense when you take the increased quantity into account.
---
I for one welcome our Molerat overlords.
---
I go melee and Molerat chunks is +1 STR, which is quite good at low levels and I basically survive on Molerat chunks.
---
very nice, i have mine under a bridge myself 
---
:)
---
I had a player do that last night. He kept chewing and chewing. Every time he was close to me just \*crunch\*\*crunch\*\*crunch\* Eventually I got crackers and did the same thing back. They turned their mic off.
---
It’s about 25 percent of your health. Unless somebody is running Bloodied (which you can typically oneshot in this new combat system) or extremely careless, they’re going to be at full health next time they come back to life.
---
I think it would be better just to make some effects not work in pvp
---
What happens in the dev room stays in the dev room. That’s the Wastelanders Code. 
---
&gt;No, it was not issues with my ISP, if you knew anything about technology you would know that framerate and bluescreens have little to nothing to do with connection.
---
Lol, yeah, you might say I have little bit about the technology as I've been paid to know about it for the past 30 years. Your connection and your ISP can, and will, have a major impact on your experience. 
---
How do you factor that 10s of thousands, millions even, of others around the world DON'T have any frame rate issues. Again, perhaps the issue is on YOUR side of the wire. 
---
&gt;I don't care about karma on reddit. Making new accounts takes all of 2 minutes. Keep those downvotes coming.
---
If you didn't care about it you wouldn't be such a coward and use your actual login. Just saying. 
---
I think it makes sense to have the cap reward cap at a certain amount, like 150 or so each death.
---
Cannot upvote enough.
---
I have a base surrounding an Acid None just above Gauley Mine, and I am going to have to shift the whole thing by 2 foundations cause a damn tree pokes through the metal wall.
---
On Runsescape in the player owned houses there is a costume room where you could store cosmetic items. Was very helpful for decluttering the bank back in the day. Maybe have items for this within our own C.A.M.P's.   
---
I had an idea for C.A.M.P mannequins that we could dress up by interacting with it and it would strip the clothes from our back and the mannequin would wear the clothes. Interacting with it again it would swap anything you're wearing and completely change you into what the mannequin was wearing.   
---
There's something similar on Rust but It's a locker that you swap costumes and items with a transfer system.   
---
Bethesda could even make it that we could skin the mannequins through atom shop to look more life like to scare the pants off us (literally). 
---
My favorite was when I was doing the firefighters questline, and it has you running around on the tops those gutten concrete buildings.
---
molerats popping straight out of concrete, 25ft in the air. ronburgundy.png
---
Also, the gun will randomly eat a core. So you walk around, shoot stuff... And suddenly you're at 5 cores remaining, even though you haven't depleted the current core.
---
Gatling lasers have the same issue. 
---
It's The Molepocalypse.
---
If nothing else it would be worth testing.  
---
Imo as its a BETA they should try it for a week.  Create a script that suppresses 100% of all legendary effects in survival only, and see what shakes out.  
---
This will obviously make bloodied builds obsolete as they require legendary effects to exist, along with berserker and junky builds though I don't know if people actually use those in pvp (up until recently junkies was useless as you couldn't aqcuire addictions)
---
Yeah, at first glance I was confused as well, but it’s like diluted stimpaks. 3 margs May be better than 1 tequila 
---
Maybe you're right, but I don't think so. Most times I've died I remember coming back with some rads still. 
---
OK so you're just a selfish ass then.  You can't even comprehend that someone else wants something different from you. Also, I'm saying you will still have the mode you want.  You can still kill everyone and do everything you're doing now.  But it will be players of similar levels to you.  I still haven't heard anything from you that explains why you're against this concept.  
---
And I fully agree that they need to add more content to adventure more for sure.  But don't you see that they are basically the same thing?  It's like... the only reason you're playing this game is to endlessly, repeatedly kill people.  Wow.  Such fun.  There are other games like that out there, why does fallout have to be just like them?  Can't there be a uniquely fallout themed experience here that more people can enjoy?  No, not according to you evidently
---
Avoid highly populated areas. This is bad advice. 
---
So instead of using the Adventure mode - more geared towards, "casuals" as was put, the "Survival Mode" should be adapted to his playstyle. 
---
But, GRRREEAAAT inclusion. 
---
Two things:
---
-I made this account to post what I have so far.
---
-This is my only account. 
---
Nice try though.
---
My idea wasn't so much for PvP server.  It was more based on a survival adventure mode.  It more goes along with the ideas the developers originally had to where it would create tense moments when we run into another player.  It's becomes a tense moment because you didn't realize you would run into another player because you weren't watching the map for the player dots.  It was never tense before because I knew where they were on the map and the slap damage prevented me from being scared.
---
 There are so many play styles these days that you will never find the perfect servers for everybody unfortunately.
---
&gt; I saw video where guy is getting constantly hit, hp goes 0, then getting his hp back to 50%
---
My guess is that he has legendary armor with the Life Saving effect; this gives you a 50% chance to revive yourself with a stimpack, every minute, when you're incapacitated 
---
I got a hit marker on him but nothing happens but I am not angry or upset about it.
---
oh i'm nowhere near the first person to come up with it, I just think making up silly acronyms is fun. 
---
What did you expect ? Yall thought it would be so great, and I have read what seems like an endless amount of posts claiming  Bethesda needed to make a pvp system so yall could play this way now yall are complaining about it ? Really ? 
---
&gt;Forced to participate
---
Pretty sure they won't ban you if you don't participate in parts of the game you don't enjoy playing.
---
I'm on PC.  I can craft some for you.
---
Once again, it’s conditional, but much more useful than bloodied, Furious, TS, and A.A. right now. It’s your best option, even if it isn’t applicable 100 percent of the time.
---
Do the West Tek &amp; Robco legendaries spawn indoors, outdoors, or is it random?
---
sssssalty
---
I didn't realize he was talking about a survival server.
---
That would be really stupid. Thats like:"Hey, lets make all weapons and gear same strong as they are level 5". One point of online games is to progress and get better gear. If you cut out the legendary effect, there is no gear to chase after. I get that some people are F4 players and they are used to play in their phase, what is 1 hour a day and then they expect to be equal to players who play 3 hours a day. 
---
I ended up number one today while I was questing in the NW.  A kid asked me to join their team so we could bounty hunt together but after we cleared out the WV Lumber Co of greenskins, i let him kill me as I was going to come off anyway. He was way pleased.
---
These are great questions. Thanks for asking!
---
Glitchy armor?
---
Thank you. 
---
How did you possibly draw the conclusion that they are in the dev room? 
---
Are you by chance aware how ridiculously easy it is to mesh and build under the map? 
---
Genuinely asking.
---
You'd think the armor that was made by hand would have the most customization options, but they seem intent on keeping raider armor looking like trash.
---
I agree about human meat being ethical due to consent.
---
It's also the only meat that provides nourishment and dinner conversation...
---
Because, as with Velociraptors, you are alive when we start to eat you.
---
I think alot of people who say this forget that FO76 subreddit isn't a PC-only community. With that said, even if Bethesda gave the thumbs up to mods in 76, the PS4 players would be SOL. So any change to it would have to be Bethesda's side that did it, which is why Atom Shop makes the most sense.
---
I had suggested to Bethesda a solution to that issue back when Sony was being a smol child over giving open-access like M$ did. That what they need to do is add in thousands of dummy files into the game. Since they contain zero info, they would be virtually sizeless, but it would now give modders files to change to their desire and actually replace with whatever they want. Granted, it would limit the number of mods as some could very well conflict with another who happened to just modify those exact same files, but given modders already do compatibility patches when a popular mod conflicts with theirs, it's not a stretch to think they'd do similar in this instance  
---
\[/off topic\]
---
So, just to be clear, you created your account,  specifically and solely to troll a game you don't even play... does that about sum that it up? 
---
I lost about 2500 caps in 2 hours. 
---
I like the extra exp not the extra  cap loss
---
Yes, you are unobjective, because you spend your time reporting other people's ideas rumors and gossip. Spend your day clearly looking for things that are hot and then quickly putting out a video.
---
And then when you are wrong, you take your time in correcting it when you are wrong. 
---
You fuel the toxicity amongst gamers because it makes you money, and then you act like you are some professional. You aren't. You a gossip and rumor monger. 
---
They could introduce a new city with human NPC's that's considered a safe zone that would act as a player HUB. There could be a whole back story and quest line involved with the place and how they survived. It could have very helpful utilities like auction houses, shops etc. and has a no cap charge to fast travel to. 
---
I've noticed a lot more hanging out around my camp, but I also moved shortly before the patch, so terrible pre-patch sample size. 
---
Non-starred legendaries do not count
---
It has been bugged like this for quite some time.
---
It isn’t, but that’s why I’m playing survival. I level up a lot faster and I can hold my own. I gained more caps than lost somehow with a shitty melee build
---
I 100% agree with this.  Another alternative is to change some legendary effects so they arent secondary modifiers that can be paired with primary modifiers like assassins/unyielding/anti-armor/bloodied/two-shot.  
---
And those are Explosive, Sentinel &amp; Cavalier.  NONE of those should be secondary legendary modifiers.  All of these should be Primary so they can't be paired up with the existing primary effects leading to absurdly powerful builds.  Not a perfect solution but it would greatly even the parity between gear if you had to choose which of these effects you wanted to collect.  The combinations we have currently are too OP for a PVP game.
---
Just throw away survival and call it what it really is, battle royal. 
---
I’ve racked up over 25 mole rat chunks with only 30 minutes of playing lol
---
It is not a game mechanic problem it is a thiughtless player problem. Beth said aids will drop prior to survival going live. What happened? Players went into survival with a bunch of Aid, then they whine when they lose that aid.
---
IMO the game mechanics are fine. Compare two characters. A level 20 and a level 200. A level 20 has an incomplete build and is at a disadvantage. However, they can still kill the level 200 given the right circumstances. A level 200 would have to kill the level 20, 20 times to get the same amount of caps the level 20 can get by killing the level 200 once. 
---
The issue is when a level 200 that is ill prepared for pvp fights an actual end game pvp build. They are at a disadvantage but they are also bringing a water pistol to a gun fight. Nerfing the mechanics to make up for crappy pvpers is not the answer. Crappy pvpers learning the game mechanics and farming the items needed to be better is the answer
---
That would fix balancing quickly, but kill any point in playing outside of "death match" style goofing around. That would truly make it death match style if you remove all incentive to properly gear up.  People like to build up characters. Its a staple of this franchise and most like it. Regardless what mode people dont want to invest time on an avatar that will just be reset, regardless of the time frame involved. As well as it would render half the world useless to players as you wont be hanging around watoga doing missions as a level 10... and so on.     
---
Other games handle this issue with seasons and tiered gear.  As one season ends a new begins. More powerful gear is released and the carrot on the stick keeps them playing and aiming for that latest top tier gear. At the same time as the new gear is released common gear that has the effects of the previous seasons top tier are released and quickly average players are geared up to an equal level with those who had that previous seasons top tier.   
---
Those who manage to get geared earlier than others get to enjoy having an edge over the average player, but nobody feels they wasted there time or got reset,when technically each season resets the playing field.  The gear they earned previously they still get to use, it just isnt as effective as the new goodies.  It keeps the ball rolling without alientating long term players.  
---
They will need to adopt some form of this to make this mode work as it is, and I dont see Bethesda having the man power required to handle such a task as it really does take a dedicated team to manage and isnt something they can just slap together once and leave to run itself like they seem to expect.  
---
That's not true. You record some video so to seem like you are playing the game. But like others have noted, you read posts here, then toss out a quick video.
---
People are onto you scam. You are a problem. 
---
I accidentally made my camp near sugar grove but it is a nice spot where the deathclaws hunt the cave crickets
---
Anyone who wants to new characters only is short sighted and not taking a critical look at their suggestion. 
---
They're just making a snap suggestion based off perceived unfairness. 
---
Is this on xbox directly south of vault 76? 
---
 Demanding that Survival require everyone to create new level 1 characters to play the mode essentially solves ONE problem and that's duped armor/weapons. A problem which is RADICALLY overstated in it's importance 
---
Wrong .. It is of Major importance! 
---
" Dupers weren't just handing their gear out like candy, they were charging exorbitant amounts of caps or cash for the things and their ONLY audiences were people that happened to find them in places like the trade sub" 
---
Wrong again .. They were not duping 2 or 3 at a time .. they were duping hundreds some times Thousands .. And they **were** just giving them away. So, WRONG again .. I met with a Guy to buy a 2shot exploding pump shotty .. Guess what, When he showed up to the trade he quickly realized he was maxed out on caps and he just GAVE me the gun. Guess what? Anyone who had friends playing were given Duped stuff for free. Had another guy admire my base and asked me to build him one, when I was finished I was given a TSE handmade .. 
---
I could keep going and going .. but judging by your post nothing I say is going to change your mind. 
---
Long Story Short it should be new Characters and they should be locked to that Server mode .. I get it that you want to play survival mode with the Toon you worked so hard to build up. I can tell from your post the passion you have towards anyone daring to utter them words, but truth be told it is the only way to guarantee a clean non duped server. And if you're locked to that server mode .. No gun dealers can just meet you in survival and give you a duped Item. It guarantees a duped free experience ... unless there is still duping exploits going on out there ... hmm? 
---
I have a lvl 170 toon .. I worked hard on that toon , I got some great gear through trading on the Market, as well as treasure hunting by going after legendarys.  I am okay with starting over in a Survival Mode thats forces everyone to start from scratch.  
---
and when I wanna play my took i worked hard on in adventure mode .. I would just switch back to that mode. 
---
Because you aren't honest. I'm not the only one that clearly thinks this. 
---
Nice to hear from someone else who was *made* to learn this, but if they weren't already compelled (by a supervisor of some kind, if not some bizarre desire to not embarrass themselves) to do more than glance at their code and "verify" that it's correct before now, then either they don't understand why these suggestions are reasonable or they need supervision that isn't available. Either way, I'm not optimistic. 
---
The main arguement I'd have here is that it's much easier to balance the basic damage/dps of base weapons &amp; armor than it is to balance them PLUS balance all of the variables of item stats/legendary effects/perk cards/chems/etc.  The simpler it is the easier it is to implement good PVP balance for gear/build parity.
---
I loved watching people in crazy outfits marching painfully slow with the bots
---
I JUST found this place last night. It's amazing!
---
Lol just the reaction i expected 
---
I hear only started legendary enemies count.  Maybe try Wes Tek, I get them there often.
---
Do you know if instigating works on players with radiation damage? Similar to how bloodied weapons trigger with high radiation damage ?
---
Um...No. I hope that isn't how you find enjoyment in the game either.
---
Future DLC maybe? 
---
It is not for everyone. TSE builds are not even meta anymore. The fact is that by honest or nefarious means some players have prepared for pvp. You can either beat them at their own game by knowing the game mechanics and farming end gear or you can beg Beth to nerf them.
---
The second option sounds kind of pathetic. 
---
Or that :P if you're dying right outside the vault though I don't understand why they don't just go in adventure for a minute and not be right in front of the vault.   It's a big map lol
---
Potentially, just can’t get into survival mode rn as I have too many aid items and not enough storage space
---
not nearly enough people are playing for this right now
---
See I agree as melee isn’t viable in real life but it’s not real life. Every build should at least have a chance.
---
Everyone should be more tanky instead of getting one shot by the tip of an explosive radius from an explosive black powder. 
---
I get they are try for a realistic approach in where if you get shot in the head you are going to die but it’s an mmo, every build should have a chance. 
---
Because they didn't think disabling legendary effects in Survival Mode was a good idea, or they didn't even consider it.  Either way, the long term survival of this game depends on some serious PVP balancing.  I'll still play Survival Mode, but they could make it much better with some changes.  Hopefully after the Beta is over Bethesda makes some tweaks to make it a more well rounded mode.
---
With 30 years of experience under your belt, I would expect you to know the difference between server tickrate and framerate. I would also expect you to know that server issues will never cause your console to hard crash.
---
This is also my only reddit account, which i made to comment on the shitshow that is this game. Nice try there though pal.
---
I am sure that will get fixed
---
The aid and cap loss absolutely destroyed my enjoyment of Survival, it's ridiculous, the risk out ways the reward too much. I lost 30 stims in one death once, terrible.
---
Yeah or scale up to level 50 and then stop or somewhere around there since at that point you're just moving perks around and  stuff.   Most of my levels now are just from trying new builds.  I did make another character for heavy Gunner. But just swapping melee weapons takes like 9 levels to get the 2 hand or 1 hand cards maxed out. (for example)
---
Grenade launchers are fun, though. I use them in every game where they're available. I've already got one that's Instigating so I don't necessarily *need* Crushing Blow, but the bonus limb damage sure would be nice.
---
So everyone should have vanilla icecream and not have variety?  This suggestion just limits a players freedom in their build. Its fantastic that this game has so much variety. You can smack someone with a bloodied walking cane or falcon punch someone with a boxing glove and still have a viable path to pve or pvp victory. What you should really be asking for after this pvp mode has been out for a month or two are finer tweaks to the balancing of each legendary effect. once they use player stats to analyze what needs buffed or nerfed. 
---
I got 8 stupid fuckin codes for the nukes. All the same one. And I can’t get rid of them. 
---
All they need to do is disable sentinels and cavaliers gear i feel, assassins needs to stay just by its very nature but being able to stand still and take no damage juat makes the entirety of pvp pointless and one sided. 
---
What? Seriously?
---
I am still one-shotting with my rifle build. Yes, in survival mode. I thought that it was simply a case of the "rebalancing" being done as competently as the supposed invincibility window during spawn-in.
---
Bingo.  Vault 76 and Train Stations are safe zones.  CAMP spawns and everything else is fair game.
---
I can agree with you on that 
---
You raise a good point, it could even be rewritten lore that she was another company making a different version of the successful mistress of mystery or vice versa 
---
Not if them toons are locked to the specific mode.  
---
Don't take a workshop unless you can defend it. 
---
Is the safe the door into the underground? Where do you get the key for the safe?
---
But in a place that having enough damage to defend yourself, it’s crucial to use something that viable.
---
I agree, I did meet to nice guys yesterday though. I was doing One Violent Night trying to get the legendary challenges done when a guy came up, I waved and we started killing Ghouls, his buddy came and he didn't murder me either so I grabbed a banjo, the Ghoul showed up and we started killing him....then I died because one of them had an explosive gun... BUT he invited me to the team right after and apologized (it was a pretty obvious mistake) and we ended up playing together for a couple hours. so yeah, 99.9% of the survival folks are sadly going to be jerks, but there is always the slim chance you might not get murdered right away. 
---
A very Big problem IMO.
---
You must have missed the pvp warning that pops up prior to taking the workshop. It is an easy war ing to miss. It is usually right in the middle blocking a large chunk of your screen and requires you to acknowledge it before continuing. 
---
Bro anybody that played wow during vanilla will tell you that was the best the game ever was. I played wow for 5 years, if you wanted to pvp during any expansion you had to grind to be competitive. There was no point in jumping into arena 5 minutes after you maxed out. The same goes for the pve content, you werent gonna hit max level and just jump into the hardest raid. I think what people arent getting it that this is endgame content for pvp. Its meant for peoplento have someth in ngnro do after already grinding for 500 hours.  Its selfish, lazy and near sighted for you want want everyone to start fresh. I would be 50 in one week, others maybe sooner. 6 months from now there will be new players at a huge disadvantage just like now. Nothing changes, other than the fact that it temporally becomes easier for a few lazy people.
---
I'm fine with the cap loss.
---
I'm not fine that I am punished for my level and others are rewarded for it when me at level 130 is no more powerful than another guy at level 50
---
Aw, come on, you had at least a couple thousand nanoseconds to react...
---
There is actually no differences between a level 180 and a level 80 except for their cards. He played the way he wanted and you being 40 should have already known that workshops aren't a safe place. They are known to be targeted for their resources like Fusion cores.
---
Go to your xbox setting.  Go to shut down then click FULL SHUTDOWN then turn xbox back on.
---
It seems to have fixed my game.
---
A level 80 is as strong as a 185, after 50 youre pretty much equal
---
I just don't think people who have extra time/money (buying game stuff for real cash) should have an advantage from the get go.
---
I don't actually mind the builds, what I do mind is that not every gets an even chance because they allow cross mode characters.
---
PC.  You're on my friends list.
---
Lol you know at lvl 50 your just as strong as the other guy even if he is lvl 200 system is more in your favor than his....welcome to the Wasteland kid 😂 
---
It's actually *that* red door. Just go past and there's the cap stash he's talking about. 
---
I ran into one player using a voice modulator during the parade. Now I want one..
---
\^My thoughts exactly. For some reason your weapon that does the same amount of damage as mine can one-shot kill reliably while mine cannot? If the devs somehow tied weapon type to max possible damage they can apply on a first shot, that was incredibly irresponsible not to tell us that, and just as damaging for weapon diversity. Also, silly. So every sniping weapon but the gauss rifle can't one-shot now? Then snipers will ONLY use gauss and everything is still broken.

Maybe 200 caps at most
---
I had a guy invite me to team near White springs. I could hear him hitting a bong which should have been the first warning. He suddenly says someone is in his camp. Apparently he doesn’t like this and attacks the guy in his camp. The guy he attacked had friends that proceeded to level him over three times and leveled his base. It was amazing. The guy rage quits because he lost all of his caps. 
---
I put away most of my stuff and I feel like I got punished because I didn't drop but 2 of the spoiled meat I had but dropped 7/10 stims I had on me.
---
It seems like it favors actual items vs ingredients.
---
How much you want for it? 250 caps sound good?
---
I will help you spread Atom's munificence
---
I am!!! Ha!!! Even better!!
---
this would make sentinels/assasins even more op :P
---
I guess so.
---
Congrats. I hate you.
---
Level 45 or 50
---
I spawned into with my main (lvl51) by accident, was killed 3 times in 2 minutes and lost everything I worked on the night before. I want to love it as well, I was so pumped for PvP originally. But this needs to be fixed to allow for survival-only characters and maybe more incentive to play it other than getting slaughtered by high levels and/or dupers.
---
&gt;it's hard to argue with Lone Wanderer's 20% damage reduction.
---
This is why I keep a bodyguards card around.
---
&gt; “I’ll see for myself,”
---
Whish more people was like that.
---
I'm serious, ever since they nerfed tse weapons every patch has been great in my opinion, damage and mechanic adjustments 
---
You must not have run into anyone using full assassin/sentinel and Lone Wanderer yet...Go ahead and hammer one of those players in the face from stealth without VATS and let me know how it works out for you.
---
I supported it by giving then $180 for their collector's edition. I do not support microtransactions in any way. 
---
Do you even understand the problem? It's only pvp. Imagine if every npc attacked you on sight. Would that be fun? 
---
Wow people aren’t kidding about the spawn kills huh?
---
&gt; Shotgun shoots 8 pellets, two shot shotgun shoots 9 pellets
---
This is the part where I circle your work in red and write "see me after class" at the top.
---
Exactly. You paid $30 for a full game that you got 400 hours out of, so how the hell is a few skins worth $15?
---
Welcome, welcome :)
---
Finally home, sent you that friend request, i'll most likely pay you a visit tonight :)
---
You can actually get cannibalised?
---
I'd rather they be priced properly. 
---
People are dicks .. don't spend over a hour, you should be able to take the workshop in a short period of time. You don't need to do the start of the power plant, just build a fusion reactor instead, take the workshop.
---
Level means nothing, it's the type of build, you can have a. powerful build at level 40 that will drop him if done right, take a look at builds on youtube.
---
I haven't confirmed but you could also setup the workshop, leave and come back and let the workshop run on it's own, in theory should continue producing cores. If nobody owns it, typically others won't bother taking it, they want your caps. Then stay crouched and hidden while the cores generate. Maybe someone can confirm if they will continue to generate at an unowned workshop.
---
if someone takes it, jump to another server and just do the same thing over .. only spend 10 mins or less setting it up ..
---
I had no idea what was going to happen, since I just recently started playing.  ( I try to avoid spoilers when I can when on here)
---
I ended up in the bottom right corner of the map...
---
I got shit on, hard.
---
I can tell you didn’t actually understand my post because at no point did I say everyone should start fresh. In fact, in another thread I specifically said I don’t want a fresh start.
---
this is the entirety of survival: some dude and his friends camp at New Gad. People try to kill them. They do some cheesy shit. The end. Honestly, I enjoy PVP -- not as much as in other games, but I like open world PVP. Not repeatedly attacking someone's camp to try to get to them. I'll go back when it's actually interesting.
---
What are you doing that allows you to VATS people 3 times in the face without them whipping around and ending you in one shot with their explosive shotgun as soon as you fire at them the first time?
---
If super mutants are managing to kill you, you shouldn’t even be considering survival. 
---
Or at least don’t act surprised when you die over and over again, likely to 1 shot from a low dmg gun, because that’s going to happen.
---
You can't kill each other during an event, I think, I couldn't while doing the fertile soil event 
---
I'm the same with travel, I will only fast travel to reach a nuke zone before all the good shit is killed, but i've started mental noting what spots trigger them and just avoid those trigger spots and instead C line around said trigger zone.  The trigger zones are not very big but are placed in areas you naturally pass through when running most direct routes. Takes a few seconds longer to C line around said trigger spots but still faster than having to stop and waste time/ammo killing them.   
---
Start mental noting where you are standing when you hear that first audio sound before one pops up,and in future give that spot a bus length of distance next time through. Eventually you will have it nailed.
---
They are priced at whatever people are willing to buy them at. What you think they're worth is not necessarily what the market thinks
---
I can't remember, probably just have to pick it
---
My camps right by west tek, and I went a solid 2 weeks straight clearing that place every day and no legendaries. Last time I went there was 3, seen as many as 6, but since I put my camp there 2 monthes ago the first month was a guaranteed 2-3 every run, the last month I've averaged less than 1 a run and often go 2-3 runs without any including the 2 week dry spell. 
---
I don’t think you can do 10 cap bounties
---
TSE CAMPER KILLED ME QQ WTF BETHESDA!
---
Again, you seem to think you know the cause of the problem, yet millions are not experiencing it like you are,(frame rate of 0), so, bingo, client side. 
---
If this is your only reddit account, created just 7 days ago, the you're saying you created it specifically to troll a GAME that you don't even play? You don't see anything sad or pathetic about that? Perhaps outright socialpathic? 
---
Alright well let me know, if you need extra space you could make a mule account. We don’t pvp often, and our HQ is in a hidden area in the Toxic Valley, defended by massive walls, and mounted turrets
---
Like as in trying to push a false narrative or misrepresenting something accidentally? 
---
If you wanna add me on PSN at radiationdaddy I’ll be around in roughly thirty minutes or so! You can check out my stash. I’ve got loads of melee weapons. 
---
well they had 10 cap bounties.
---
You are level 300?
---
Stashing caps is one option, but another is to create a survival character...  run lean and mean, low level, little loss.
---
Thats my plan...  adapt
---
What Survival mode ? or Fallout 76 the game ? hahahaha .. 
---
I mean you still have a good amount of perks and consumables for customization of your build, and everyone has equal access to those perks and items if they play long enough, which gives you incentive to play and level up. It seems like balancing for PVP without messing up PVE balance is difficult for Bethesda atm and it wouldn’t hurt to test it out in the beta at some point 
---
Well, I'm not right next to them, I'm crouching so they can't vats me, and by the time they see where I am they are already dead
---
I agree completely 
---
Good point. But in my defence I used to fight them a bit carelessly as I had tons of stimpaks. I was also in a rush and didn’t give them much attention. Besides they were level 68. I also slaughtered all of them but didn’t notice the dog. In the end they manage to get my health at very low and that is why I started by: good point. 
---
I am just talking about what I record. I used to just do melee and am more apt with that so will go into high level areas. People got tired of seeing that in the background so I used more ranged weapons, but I never specced out a character for that and as a result stick to lower lever areas as my build is bad for it. I honestly never thought the background footage made too much of a difference, but with this in mind I'll try to get some more interesting stuff 
---
LOL that's called skillz kid. git gud love your salty tears. Jokes aside, why the f is this a thing? I feel like none of the devs ever played an online game before
---
Agreed, can you help us out Bethesda?
---
Don’t use the bed it’s just for ‘design’ reasons 
---
Haha many of the players complaining here expect some weird pvp dynamic in this game. Thought and twitch skills still have role. 
---
There’s a tree over my house and it’s *so* annoying.
---
Okay, I’m currently working lol, but I should be on with the next two hours at the latest, hoping to get home by 6 eastern.
---
Falchette? is one know for sure. 
---
What did they shoot you with? Explosive shotguns will still "1 shot" you because of the multiple hits. It feels like a single shot. So does an extremely fast-firing explosive automatic. It's basically instantaneous, or well before a human can even react to being shot at. Which makes the damage restriction on single bullets and melee hits completely useless anyway for anything but just turning a bunch of weapons into trash.
---
Okay so I started a new character for this, and I jumped in with two old ones. All of my caps are wiped out on both of my old ones, because everybody else ALSO has their old character. This is what people have been trying to say, it's not as fun to be running around as actual fodder, and it's even worse to end up with less spots to fast travel away, where you can be a sitting duck for somebody camped out at a train station, which is why I am here now instead of playing, because every time I spawn at a train station, the immunity expires and I die \*instantly\* because there's a level 142 there. I died twice and came back a while later because the loot I dropped was still there, and voila, it's just the same guy camping out waiting to take me out over and over again.
---
Here's what needs to happen; You need to start reserving servers for high level players. Let them battle it out if they're over level 100, compared to us under level 100. You could split that up into 1-50, 50-100, and 100+ That will even it out, that will make people like me stop complaining, but you really can't expect my level 3 to stand a chance against anything over level 100, it's just ridiculous at that point when the other player is even 4x your level at any given time,(A level 60 against a level 240) &amp; don't mention something about how anybody over level 50 is just considered level 51 or something in scaling the damage because I just wouldn't believe it.
---
Yep. Like real life, no money then get out.  Scrape 'em off Claire, they're just holding you back.
---
Sugar grove, enclave bunker, watoga high, drained them all night after night for 5 days before I got paladin and elder.  
---
Fletchettes which is essentially a multi-projectile.
---
The sought after version is Quad Explosive w/ Fletchettes as it is essentially an OP shotgun.
---
Finally after getting the required perk cards i set out to look. Found a lvl 41 diseased deathclaw, tamed it and sent it to my camp! It ran off twoards my camp. Gave it some time to get there so i went about finishing up a few things then headed back to my camp.
---
There it was! My very own pet deathclaw! It stomped around a bit checking things out. I took some pics and sent them to friends!
---
Went in my camp and repaired some weapons. Then i was like wow its quite now...went outside and my new pet was dead. Guess it just died...it was a diseased.
---
Off to look for a new pet!
---
All will bathe in the glow of Atom's radiance!
---
Brootherhood Cowards!
---
Yeah all my luck was used up on an Assassin's explosive harpoon :(
---
You mad bro?
---
The respawn is bugged atm, but the bounty system is fair n square 
---
I don't specifically think the limitation is due to consoles, because they only have to contend with their own Stash limit, and the modern consoles have 7GB of RAM (though it's shared with the GPU). I think it really comes down to being a big load on the server itself. 
---
I suspected that the reason each world is limited to 24 was because of the hacky-nature in which it was built. Basically they took FO4, grafted in some DOOM networking code, and then set it up where we are all in essence remotely playing the game. Now, where the 24 player limit comes in is where my speculation comes in... Since the server itself is still doing a lot of work, I have a feeling that they are using some of the older, High-End Xeon CPU which coincidentally have 24 cores (and 48 threads total). Where each player is assigned to a core and any extra computational work is done by each core's additional thread. 
---
If true, then over time as they upgrade servers with faster processors and more threads --like AMD's EPYC--, they'd plausibly be able to increase per-world player counts. The cost of upgrading would be high so I don't expect it'd happen anytime soon, but with current model EPYCs, they have 64 cores and 128 threads. :)
---
Lol are the super mutants, scorched, robots, animals, and every other non player in the game not npc? And guess what, they pretty much all attack you lol. Yall bullied low level players using the same or worse tactics, and now that its happening to you it's a problem ? Really ? I rarely get killed just playing the game, yet iv been killed a hundred times by some idiot, or group of idiots, roaming around destroying other peoples camps and killing other players, camping out at train stations and all. I had to start carrying a fatman and plenty of nukes as a deterrent it got so bad. You'll get no pity from me at all. All your complaining is going to accomplish is the total removal of all tse weapons, just like that same complaining got them nerfed. Yes, I understand completely, your no longer able to bully others, your now getting what yall gave out before the new mode was created and now suddenly it's a problem. Sorry you apparently thought fallout was a call of duty deathmatch. None of the regular fallout players wanted pvp to start with. The idea of being able to group up to take on challenging quests, build small villages, and still play fallout was the attraction for the regular players that have stuck with this franchise sense the start. Instead we had to spend hours grinding to replace the destroyed camps, and out looted junk cause some idiot thought it was funny to destroy our shit. Again, no pity, none at all !
---
Alot of games do have adjustments for pvp versus pve content. I think Bethesda from a technical standpoint is struggling in that department. My speculation is that the team working on f76 has alot of relatively new devs that are using old code and juggling 20 things at once. This is probably whats slowing their progress to do things like legendary effect balance rework on a large scale for the game. 
---
Anyone know what the legendary weapon actually is? And the effects?
---
&amp; here's why, you lose less caps, you get way more caps if you're lucky enough to kill somebody and get 400+ caps(waiting to see this happen) plus you WILL level up 20% quicker, but otherwise, I just don't think I'll play this game with my other characters because it's just not worth it as the mode currently sits. I'll bring my level 50 and 95 back in when there's a level 50-100 server for that. I'm not asking for a role-playing server here, yanno? That would be way too much for too small of an audience but it turns out I just want to fight people that are actually my level on a consistent basis!

The way you are writing to me makes me feel like you have personal disdain and perhaps largely don't agree with the negativity around Fallout 76 in general. I appreciate the feedback nonetheless, but the idea that I want the game to fail (which I am inferring from your post) is simply not true. 
---
Yeah my ign is Eddzil1a , drop me yours and I might join at some point 
---
If up close you can also bash them with your weapon to stagger and then shoot them.
---
So you believe playing survival with characters that have duped weapon a 'perceived unfairness'?
---
You can do that. I just want mannequins to creep people out
---
Absolutely not. The old system worked fine except for the fact that critical shots were ludicrously op due to a bug that made them ignore all resistances and effects like sentinel and assassin actually stacked, which wasn’t intended.
---
Fixing those two aspects would have made PvP fine. This new system didn’t even need to be made to start with.
---
What they decided to do was make every semi gun 3 hits to kill, autos 5, heavy guns 10-20 and melees 3, regardless of the weapon type or effect, but not port this change over to sentinel, as it’s still 40+ shots to kill them with anything. Bloodied is now useless.
---
Now there is 0 point in making a build that isn’t pure action points and stealth cheese. They deleted the viability of all but 1 build, and one set of gear.
---
This isn’t balanced at all. Melee is essentially dead, everyone is running sneak builds or sentinel armor and standing around spawn points. It’s literally scarecrows in a field. Anything that moves is dead. 
---
Not only that, but now the game actively discourages leveling. A level 180 will die for 360 caps while a level 15 could kill him in 3 hits, and have to die 12 times to lose the caps gained from the 180.
---
And now the game discourages collecting gear, because the combat is whoever gets the most vats shots with a handmade, and if the damage was changed a bit, it still would not include legendary effects. Marvelous. My level 15 character is officially more powerful than my 180. So now I’m being punished for putting time in.
---
They use the spawn bug as an exploit to farm caps, just jump server, jump spot or gather a team and wipe them and turn the table around 🤘
---
Thx bud!
---
Agree to disagree :)
---
Honestly, you must have been fighting some idiots (no offense). I do the same thing, and it works on people without Asshole/Sentinel gear and explosive weapons, but anyone with it and I get explosive shotgun/rifle spammed back along my line of fire and dead before I can kill my opponent, even if I get the complete drop on them. 
---
To be fair not many will be on an even playing field with the people with duped weapons.
---
Then don’t pvp, seems pretty simple to me. Most games have a way to get an unfair edge over the competition. Rarely are games perfectly balanced. 
---
Lol. Your teammate being able to kill you the second someone puts a bounty on you and then give you back your stuff is not "fair in square".
---
Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop.
---
That would make an interesting camp/character build!
---
The jerks and the aholes looked and shouted "save us" and you whispered "no"...
---
Yeah but when it’s a group of 4 in the camp it’s a little tough to destroy and pretty easy to rebuild with the push of a button.
---
Mole Rat, Mole Rat, where $^&amp;# you come from?

Can I copyright fallnight? Lol

sight: standard, long scope, i forget the name of #3

flechette is the most beneficial especially if they didnt patch the ammo recovery on it yet, and either non standard sight will set you up fine.

I'd have an **aneurysm** if one dropped for me at this point.

How do you stop it from happening. You use the word teammate but no one teams up officially in pvp unless they are using stranger in numbers. Otherwise the work together but use lone wanderer. So how do you determine friendly killing vs true use of the bounty system.
---
but hey, ever need a 1 star Zealots pool que I got about 30 for sale! /fp

But you can use toilets? Proof:   [https://imgur.com/a/Y5rNUnG](https://imgur.com/a/Y5rNUnG) 
---
What rifle? Apparently something funky is going on weapon-to-weapon. Gauss people are saying they can one-shot, while bloodied Lever Action, Black Powder, and Dragon people are often reporting they can't even with super-high damage builds. 
---
There is nothing crazy with your suggestion at all. I think we can all agree that Bethesda wants this to be the PvP mode of F76, and the core of a great PvP game is it being a skill based one.
---
There are some crazy legendary effects inherited from Fallout 4(a single player game) that just don't belong here in a multiplayer game, especially if you intend to have some sort of meaningful PvP combat.
---
If they made it so that Legendary effects from weapons and armor were disabled against other players but still work normally against PvE mobs the game mode would improve dramatically imo. Then they could start tweaking other stuff like perks cards/weapon type/armor type/consumables/etc.
---
For example. When Bethesda had the data leak, you were quick to report it with a clickbait video saying thousands of people’s information leaked.
---
Within hours of the rumor being posted. Two days later Bethesda gave us numbers. No ones credit info was released. It was 123 customer service tickets and only 64 included the last 4 digits of cards which simply identifies which card type. 
---
It took you I think 9 days to update that. With yet another new video. But you left the old one up. 
---
Why? Why leave a video up you know has wrong information? 
---
Because having a lot of videos up helps you.
---
That’s why your dishonest. A high amount of content, even when it’s false is more important to you than accuracy.
---
You’re here simply because people are turning against you and you want to try and turn that around.
---
Start by admitting you aren’t always honest or objective. Start with your self.
---
Yeah that was after the last big big update it was so fucked lol. But yeah it just shows the status! It’s pretty handy to keep around so definitely don’t sell or get rid of it! 
---
Mole rats are BS so you need to fight fire with fire.  By far the best weapon for dealing with mole rats and trash enemies in the game is the automatic tesla gun. The arcing allows for slightly inaccurate shooting and can arc underground to kill them as they are burrowing. 
---
I have always thought that they are saving the lunch boxes to make them loot boxes like in fallout shelter.
---
But with all the initial backlash on the game they probably decided to wait before adding more microtransactions
---
Your friends list.... its linked to the game and obviously the ingame team. It's not that difficult 
---
Hey man Think I got an extra fat man with some mini nukes I can spare. Oh you on ps4 nvm
---
More exposure yeah, but that is not in my opinion for the best of all. And irrealistic was not for that but for many of ideas that are given, which are creative but non applicable. Look at all the suggestion  threads and honestly tell me if many of them are realistic. Of course you have to think about the old graphic core of the game, the others right for music for example, rentability for Beth etc. Its a company and what it is still their most important is short term profit. That is why this game and anthem for example has been realised unfinished.
---
That is amazing.  I suck so bad at building a camp and running electricity through it.  Its always a bod with crappy connectors lol i need to watch some youtube or something.  i break things not build them in video games, in real life i do both but cannot apply it for some reason!
---
Cheers man!

I would wager they have never set foot in the actual online environment, all their "testing" is done on an in-house server with perfect connection, they have no idea how this game plays in the real world.
---
I couldent be better. Just sick of seeing people whine cause they are getting what they didn't have a problem dishing out on others. In fact, I'm laughing my ass off over it. I have sat and watched this whole thing play out sense day one. All the people whining right now about this crap are the exact same people that thought it was funny to act the same way to the rest of us just playing fallout. You know how many times I had to server hop just to get away from roaming bands of wannabe raiders ? Or some do shit stalking lower level players ? Until I had leveled up and got my own stash of decent weapons and armor ? I have a family, and a job. I dont get much time to play and much if it was wasted on these fools. Smh. Serves them right for treating other players like that to start with. As if said countless times, fallout was never meant to be a pvp game. 
---
Aspects of it are unbalanced, sure. But the things youre complaining about arent an imbalance, they are literally to be expected. We were informed of the exact things youre complaining about.
---
Bounties reveal their location on the map, which is basically a death sentence on PVP heavy servers. 10 cap bounties are likely for breaking people's doors down

How hilarious you’re taking such issues with someone’s view of your work when s you do is try and make money off of making hate video of a game we can tell you aren’t really playing.
---
The only time you report on facts is when a reddit post gets it right.
---
You offer very little original content. We all know you mainly use Reddit posts to come up with content.
---
It’s not that people just don’t like you. It’s that it’s obvious what your doing. You just think you can talk your way out of this.

 I Can confirm that you have to do the killing blow to get credit, I had to be selfish during a uranium Fever event in survival mode to test it. I had 1 legendary kill before and then 4 total afterwards. The legendaries were 2-3stars for those last 3 kills, I can’t remember what star level the first one was.
---
Inside Watoga Emergency Services, for me, there has always been a legendary on the top floor. Usually a Wendigo or a Super Mutant, sometimes a ghoul. Usually over lvl 50 I think.
---
you were invulnerable, but then you loaded in.
---
Hey ill probably try to hit your shop up tonite username is Thumper4739
---
I think maybe it should level match within a certain parameter.  Like, when you loading in you the server will be populated with other characters = your level or +/- 5 levels.  Something to keep it more equal.    
---
I played yesterday with a new character (level 3) and just had fun exploring (and running away) from people.    
---
Or maybe they could deincentivize (is that a word?) killing much lower levels (by marking you or maybe you CAN'T take their stuff if their "x levels lower".   
---
Hello,
---
I'll be on in about 2 hours and would be happy to do a silo run with you. I can provide you a launch card if you haven't gotten one yet. I'll be happy to teach you how to get them if you haven't gotten to that point. 
---
Feel free to add PSN: t33gs-oosah
---
No compensation needed. I've had a lot of help in this game and am always happy to pay it forward. I might need a little grind time for some adhesive before we go.
---
Your literal luck score has a lot to do with it. I can run Whitesprings on my char with 15 luck and get 10 legendaries off of non legendary ghouls.

This is amazing, grest job!

There's primary, secondary, tertiary effects you can get on a weapon. 1 star weapon gets primary. 2 star one gets primary and secondary, 3 star get all three effects. So you only get 1 primary on a weapon. two-shot and insigating(double damage when max health) are both primaries so you can't have both of those on a same weapon. Think there's a table telling you which effect count as primaries or secondaries but I'll leave the searching to you

Yep.  Those who think the game is bad watch for affirmation.  Those who think the game is good watch to be outraged by your outrage.
---
The camo bundle is still up for you guys? I don't see it anymore 
---
Run up the hill to VTU and back, usually loads it for me.
---
It's weird, it's almost like the game loads the vanilla map first, then alters it.
---
Ok that sounds cool I’ll add you. I might have enough adhesive for you 
---
Sure, all the people posting about legendary counts bugging are doing exactly that. 
---
Including yours truly. Something to do and there's a real threat even to a lvl 150.
---
I understand why it seems like VATS requires less skill than manual aiming, but advocating its removal from survival is misguided.
---
In Fallout 4, there were no real "builds" past a certain point because characters could be good at everything, all the time. If 76 worked that way, then removing VATS would handicap "every build" equally, and the real difference would be based on play style--which, one could reasonably expect, should *have* to be situationally adaptable to be competitive in any PVP sense. 
---
Fallout 76 doesn't work like that. Perk cards can only be equipped up to 50 points, total, and the distribution of those points among the SPECIAL stats is further balanced by considerations like max HP/AP, frequency of critical shots, carry weight, accuracy, enemy detection, etc.  In particular, some of the stats have specific bonuses related to VATS: perception increases accuracy in VATS, agility increases AP pool (which is diminished primarily, though not exclusively, by using VATS), and luck determines the number of attacks before a critical hit becomes available *in VATS*.  
---
Removing VATS disproportionately negatively impacts characters with investment in any of those three stats, and there's no reason why that should seem reasonable, or even desirable. Removing VATS takes away the inherent bonuses of three of the seven SPECIAL stats. Why not ask for everyone to have the same HP regardless of endurance? Both requests make about the same amount of sense.
---
Yeah, and if you accidentally drop something on grass, forget about it. It's gone.
---
Sure. That will be 10,000 Atoms please. ;)
---
Thanks someone just posted the table sheet with everything. 
---
I thought that too but I tagged a legend and my friend got the kill but neither of us got the point for it.
---
While I don't work for Bethesda, I have a theory, and that theory is basically timing.  Each of the things you mentioned, NCRRanger Armor, Atom Cats stuff, etc, that pulls on the lore from previous Fallout games would probably be very popular in the atom shop.  But....if they had launched the game with these items in the shop....I think a lot of people would have never come found them because of how poor things went at launch.  
---
So, I think items like this are coming, especially with the Faction DLC coming out later in the year.  While part of me would love to have access to this stuff now....I can at least see the business decision behind holding some of this back...assuming that is what they are doing.
---
nope, I struggle to get 200 caps in adventure mode. also I don't think I had killed a legendary at all since they are so rare untill today having played since Christmas day
---
If you get the drop on them and have a crit banked you should be able to get the finishing blow from stealth before they locate you if your output has some bite to it. Doing 250 base damage in the head crit followed up with a couple more headshots should be enough for most people 
---
Thanks. Got to know that the weapon I wanted to search can exist. 
---
I see where the rocket is attached, but no flame?!?!?!?
---
JK
---
Honestly, that looks awesome! As others noted, the details and paint look amazing! Upvoted
---
You must be on the recieving end of pvp. Theres plenty of viable builds,but of course like in any game there's a meta. Have you run a bloodied lmg build with stealth boys and one gun army to stagger lock snipers or meele? What about a commando focused furious handmade user who stagger locks meele users or other rifle users? Theres lots of viable builds but only certain gear and weapons were heavily duped so people took that flavor of the month and ran with it. Perhaps the legendary vendor coming out will change the market and availability of items a bit. 
---
Bro Imma be honest with you I wouldn't be surprised if someone was taking screenshots of this an posting it on another sub
---
I have one calibrated shock mod I could sell ya for 1000 caps :)
---
We are posting (loudly) here and getting heard. Hopefully Bethesda won't just do another EA on a product that can earn them far more than Anthem will likely do for EA.
---
agreed, the full game may have been better at launch if beta criticism was louder
---
They should make the reward a 3* piece of Assassin's Sentinel armor. Since that's what the dupers are using to dominate everyone with.
---
A thoughtful, inteligent and infornative post. What are you doing on Reddit? 
---
I'm not really trying to talk my way out of anything though? You don't like my content and I want to uncover why and hopefully gain further insights on how to improve it. The feedback I've gotten from this is rely less on reddit, so sure that is something I'll keep in mind going forward. 
---
I am genuinely not trying to being argumentative or abrasive and apologize if I came off as so. I respect the time you are taking to give me feedback and won't ignore that 
---
Would switching leader boards not change the top three on the map? If the system were to change to that if it's already not like that, wouldn't that be a better option per individual player than removing entirely?
---
Glorious! 
---
Yeah whitesprings is a toughie, cause if no one else is there the max I was seeing was like 22. Now at level 36 I'm seeing more 42 with a sprinkling of 68. If anybody over 50 is around, I don't bother, cause I'll get surrounded by too many &amp; go down. 
---
You do it for the lulz or not at all
---
Glad I could help!
---
Or at least a blue bag with a Vault-Tec logo or something. Those brown bags are ridiculously hard to see.
---
it's pretty exploitable since you can keep your caps safe that way, Risking only 10 caps while the players who target them risk double their level.
---
to be fair how do you fix that? if your teamed with someone and they make it so people in your team can't get your bounty people will get a bounty, leave team, kill teammate then rejoin
---
I think you meant to reply to Juicehead's comment.
---
Bloody lever action below 20% health, instigating lever action against full health or with a crit headshot, bloody Gauss below 20% health, instigating Gauss against full adversary health or on a crit or on a headshot.
---
It is not OP there are a couple of ways to mitigate the damage with perks and armor. 
---
Yeah... 6/25 so far, didn't spend that much time farming legendaries tho. 
---
Did most of it in the wendingo cave, pretty out of the way location, but the spawn rates are terrible. I did encounter a couple of players in the cave tho and it made me realize that my rifles are actually pretty damn deadly. 
---
Not as hellish as you might imagine. 
---
As for my reasons on why i want that useless weapon? It has an unique name. Also, what else am i going to do in Fallout anyway? I usually spend my time in whitesprings farming legendaries... This is a nice break/distraction.
---
Aaaah, thaught u were pissed at the bounty system mate, but if they are in your team and they can kill you cuz of a bounty, now that is f-ed up 🤣
---
cryptids
---
Your friends list is also linked to the game so that is another Avenue. 
---
Make a post on r/market76.  
---
Pretty sure I've seen them sell for 2k caps on PS4.  
---
I bought an X01 Jet Pack yesterday from a seller on there for 1500 caps on XB1.
---
But you can go on EBay and buy whatever you want. Man the dupers fucked up this game and Besthesda messed up by not wiping all dupes clean a couple of months ago.  Yet we should be surprised the entire PvP (survival) mode features players with killer weapons and gear.  Okey dokey
---
well Bethesda have said they are bring weapon racks from fallout ,4s dlc into the gmae at some point so I hope armour comes.
---
but you know they only didn't had it at launch since if you can display weaposn on your walls you can free up your stash
---
I didn’t let anyone tag the legendaries so idk if that factors into it, like I said extremely selfish lol
---
Yes. They can.
---
It never existed. The reason not to trade right now is that you can't inspect an item and see what all of its legendary effects are while your in the trade menu.
---
The Survival rewards can be used in Adventure mode, too, and there are still regular PvE enemies to worry about in Survival anyway. It may not be a player-killer but it can have its uses.
---
Hope they don't wait till next patch to do so.
---
You say this, but I don't think explosive adds the damage you think it adds. I'd argue that FFR can provide just as much DPS in some weapons.  When switch between an AA and a TSE gatling the difference is barely registered. That's my experience FWIW.
---
It should be changed to "Welp" or "Bye"
---
Use dense mods.  I take far less damage from exsplosive weapons then i do non. And in my opinion they honestly need a rebuff. Not a reworking . theres perk cards to increase and prevent such damage. Id honestly say mess arlund with your perk cards before making a suggestion that will require them to remove and or ruin most of the weapons in the game. And then comes another problem the mass complaints and more then likely player loss from this action
---
Well that's just it. If you have no interest in survival mode, why is your opinion relevant? Not to be an asshole but let the PvP people speak for what they want.
---
Lol bro... you ever play Quake or TFC on using 56k AOL 1.0 dial up?
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
And ? If that's what turns their crank good for em. It's no different that any other kind of online bullying so what's new ? If they were any kind of adult or decent person they would be talking shit to my face, I'm simply stating an opinion backed up by many of the players iv talked to sense the beta for the base game first came out. Do you really think I'm suddenly going to stop speaking my mind cause people are going to make fun of me lmfao, really ? Taking screen shots and teasing people behind their backs is childish, and shows a severe lack of character, let alone balls lol. Like I said, just another only bully wanting to feel good about themselves by treating their fellow man badly. They can eat a bag of dicks. If I'm such a problem they can be adults and block me. Other than that, losers do what they always do. 
---
You know when I played The Pitt dlc from Fallout 3, all I could ever think about is how damn cool a Fallout game in that setting would be.
---
My man!
---
As soon as you start your computer start spamming F8. 
---
If that doesn't work, you can try booting from a windows disk/thumbdrive.
---
Willcbe doing this once ny new survival character is the appropriate level ;)
---
Nah I didn't have Internet back then.
---
Nice man that looks pretty good. You thought about making some power armor ? 
---
Cool idea OP but maybe call it DoucheMuch instead of DeathMatch /s
---
Very cool
---
Where does everyone get the colored lights? Are those still available?
---
I think I'll take my lvl 5 char in naked just for the hell of it, and apparently Hell it is from all accounts.
---
I've been playing since the OG beta and I've run into rad scorpions like 10 times or less.  Wish i'd see them more often without hanging in the toxic valley.
---
From what I've seen people are saying that only legendaries with *'s count. I do nothing but grind legendaries and I'd probably estimate that you'd expect to find 5 of those in about 2-3 hours of strictly legendary hunting (fast traveling the entire map).
---
It's probably a 15 hour grind in survival mode to find that many. And for a 2* grenade launcher?.... LOL. Why not a piece of the Assassin's Sentinel armor?
---
That sounds like a lot of fun. Almost as much fun as spawning into a zone and getting ganked dead before you can even respond.  Nicely done Bethesda!  Beta away! 
---
I've loaded into a fresh server in the middle of nowhere and been killed before I could respond or move.....
---
Hahah! Punch it up and make it your own. It's a version if what I "sing" on area mic if every instrument is being used and all that's left is to stand in front of the mic stand like a dork.
---
Also just going "BLOODBUUUUG!" while trying to do my best Lemmy impression seems to get the same reaction.
---
Yes i know, im not a rookie here mate, but if you dont think its still OP you need to check again, with gear, cards and perks combined, shure you can survive a explosive weapon better, hit what about the rest? Compare to explosive, they are crap, and there are people out there that prob wont get their hands on one in months or even longer. See, thats the real problem. And in not sayin remove explosive, but would be fun, better and make more sense if it were its own perk. Thats my opinion atleast.
---
thanks, changed the post but the title can't be edited
---
Also you have to be the person who gets the last hit on the legendary or it won’t count for you 
---
Ouch
---
Quad is an ammo capacity thing. Tse with flechettes is what you mean. I had one. It was awesome, but heavy. 
---
Yeah but that hurts gear that people use for pve such as troubleshooter. I agree with you're idea just not completely removing all of them 
---
Contracted explosive diarrhea &gt;&gt; -2 Luck and  Charisma. 
---
Cure by sitting on toilet for 5 minutes or use antiobiotics/disease cure.
---
*Excessive alcohol increases chances of contracting explosive diarrhea*
---
*//Remove toilet paper from the game.*
---
No worries. I just need enough glue to patch up my handmades. Do you need any ammo or chems? I'll be able to provide basically everything we need. It would be helpful if you have lvl 3 lock pick or lvl 3 hacking. I can run both, but when you run on your own, they are hugely helpful. Do you have a mic?
---
Totally agree, they are crazy and all over the place. Tho sometimes they end up funny as they do stupid stuff and get stuck in the map or trees ect lol
---
Absolutely 👍 perfect solution should please all comers.
---
Right?! I thought you can put any mods on it or at least some special things!
---
Unfortunately the lowest level that Raider Power Armor can be worn is level 15
---
Considering I already have it, yes.
---
More of this 
---
Please also hear that not everyone is upset about it, I love the mode already and enjoy using my 500+ hour character in different modes!
---
I'm stuck in the "kill something with a ranged attack under the influence of wine." version of this.
---
Well I wish you coulda been there Ricky. Shit was painful and glorious at the same time. 
---
exactly, agreed 100%
---
Since pve has no player damage is there a need for pacifist mode anymore? I've Always had it turned on as I don't typically pvp much but might be time to change that.
---
Make it a new mode. Call it 'Realistic'.
---
But yeah, that could be neat. Might actually be interested in that sort of mode.
---
I dont think you understood what im saying but ok! 
---
And it was just an Idea, not a suggestion. 
---
And i have the perks, cards and all. 2 chars over 200 so i Think i got a pretty good understanding of the game 😊
---
Yes I have hacking and picking lvl 3 I’m about to get on to make ammo 
---
Ya, perhaps...
---
However, I'm almost lvl 60 but I still suck, so there's that. 
---
playing with friends would either be impossible or exploitable in this situation
---
Yes I have a mic
---
I've probably sold a dozen of those to vendor bots for 35 caps..... LOL......I had no idea they were worth this much 
---
Wouldn't the toilet make you lose AP?
---
buh-dump-bump
---
#DadJokes
---
I'm pretty sure I have a spare chest plan if you have a spare legs plan in trade.
---
Deers are squishy and give raw meat, so are some people 🤢
---
I got the recipe for a Lead Champagne Bellini, but I can’t craft it yet because I don’t have the recipe for Lead Champagne. 
---
Winner of reply if the day right here friends lol
---
Also, they would be great for decoys. We need some home alone level shit to make them move around and draw out the baddies.
---
Ok just add me and join if I’m on
---
My prediction is that armor set will get nerfed directly or indirectly. 
---
Cool, cool! Was there a specific kind of melee you’re looking for?
---
Shut up! That's a secret!
---
The leaderboard is not nearly as big of a deal as being able to transfer characters between modes. PLEASE make us make new characters and lock them to survival.
---
Checking them now and about to hop on. I should be on throughout the evening 
---
I think it's fun. I wouldnt recommend challenging the #1 pvper on the server unprepared, though.
---
Tyvm, not just me then
---
Something like that 
---
Sad for your downvotes, Reddit is a fickle mistress.
---
I figured it out! I'm on PC, and I was mousing over the challenges, but you have to select the desired challenge using the arrow keys and then press "T".
---
I'm stupid like that 
---
Agree, after lvl 60/70 when you have a build complete the only difference other higher lvl players might have are gear and more QoL perks unlocked.
---
There is no reason to unfairly punish players that just enjoy playing one character.
---
I mean the crushing blow is nothing special, but it’s unique nether the less. I’m sure by the reset next week not many will have it, especially considering a lot of the the posts floating about the reddit.
---
Hopefully only the Assassin's prefix.
---
There really isn't much left worth grinding for if they nerf  non PvP armor.
---
Only 4000 to go 😀 yay!!
---
+10% disease resistance
---
Two handed obviously. Vampiric, swing speed, executioner, bloodied, furious, instigating maybe. Anything that’s roughly equivalent to the gauss for a melee weapon.
---
Super Sledge isn't from FO76.
---
It's been around since the original Fallout. 
---
Yeah I went from like 700 caps to nothing thanks to some ass hole who was camping my CAMP. What made it even worse was he kept going even once I was out of caps. I know I should've just spawned somewhere else, but I was kinda just frustrated with the whole thing. The people who just attack on sight with their lvl 200 power armor, explosive double shot bs they probably duped need to chill
---
In the early days right after release, anyone remember the guy with god mode who literally couldn't die? Stood in a fisser to prove he was truly unkillable. Bet he is loving life in survival mode lol
---
Any tips on where to find the legendary mobs? Or just the usual whitesprings/watoga/west tek and deal with any players that might show up?
---
No, I meant what I said. Quad explosive is the sought after version as it has 4x the ammo capacity. Fletchettes turns the single projectile into a multi-shot. I have one as well.
---
I think the lighting in there is just kind of fucky because of the glowing fungus spawn and lit poster combo
---
My stash box says different. 
---
Could be worse I suppose.
---
It could be a rare mask that doesn't even drop.
---
[https://youtu.be/9st2tqph4q0](https://youtu.be/9st2tqph4q0)  Here you are bud, it aint pretty, but i hope it works
---
Both, but not always. Legendary ghouls usually spawn outside while legendary robots or super mutants spawn inside.
---
it should be disabled for higher levels, They could also introduce Free for All servers, and in ranged servers. or 1-20, 20-40, 50-XXX ( in ranged ) , Free for all 1-XXX (FFA)
---
Beautiful. Especially like how the rusty head looks to be just slathered in copper paste.
---
I think it's a perfect mix of realism and game art.
---
Levels have nothing to do with the character's strength. Equipment does. That's why they should wipe Survival servers and only allow new characters to join. Maybe even turn it into a Hardcore Survival
---
What’s your luck?
---
Meaning you can fire it four times without reloading. 
---
The tse that I had did (I think) 350 damage base. 
---
Here's the issue with your content. Like many have said, you steal from reddit. And by steal I mean you read a post, then quickly make a video. I you spend NO time looking into it. 
---
That is very irresponsible. Because you often spread rumors and lies. And then you are very reluctant to correct that. I say that because you leave those videos up because you care more about how many videos you have, over the truth. 
---
We really don't think you play the game, because of the simple video of you running around. It doesn't matter if your melee or whatever. You use simple footage of game play, which you often loop over and over while you talk about whatever you are on about.
---
The titles of most of videos are misleading and clickbait. 
---
But for me, the biggest thing is this. You lack any level of objectivity. A good reviewer/critic sets aside their personal preferences and talks about both Pros and Cons. You generally focus on the cons, and often misrepresent them. You'll take the worst possible experience someone had, and present as happening all the time. 
---
You literally make on average 1-2 videos a day on the game. Some of the videos are basically about the same thing. As much as I like the game, and as much fun I'm having, The changes and updates on the game really don't warrant that many videos. 
---
So it's become clear, you just padding your video count. Which means you'll make a video about anything, true or not. 
---
I’ll look into it!
---
You're right. My bad. 
---
I have a few cosmetic mods running that makes the game easier for my old eyes, I’ve never owned a console so can’t imagine playing the game bound to a default game install 🙀 
---
Those 'cool' things you want is gonna break the lore so hard. People want that NCR veteran ranger outfit so much but once it lands, they gonna start bitching
---
I hope so, imagine if they try to use the same engine, as they did with Fallout? 
---
They could have at least gave it a 3rd * and gave it 90% weight reduction..... LOL.
---
I sold all of my unique legendaries that I got during the campaign for stash space once I found better legendaries.
---
That is because of the way the ammo works for fusion/plasma cores. If you reload a fresh core before depleting the old one the clip will be full but it will remember how much is left from the old core. So yes it seems like you're losing cores randomly but otherwise you would have a bunch of almost depleted/half full cores and nobody wants that
---
Why dont you guys go into graphic design, or story development better ideas then the devs. at Bethesda  lmao just saying
---
Well, it is kind of cryptic, so....
---
Perfect. We'll be good to go then. I can make it through with my hammers so I can skip adhesive for now. I'll accept your friend request and join your world when I get home.
---
Try survival. They will find you. 
---
You sure? Not saying you are wrong but it seems that the dupe scene has finally started to quiet down some. At least the eBay posts are a minute fraction of what they were during the dupe hay day
---
Saw my level 14 no legendary having friend that is new to the game wreck face on a few level 100+ players last night. Levels are not the issue. Some of the legendary effects could stand to be a little balanced, that’s really about it. And a more halo-like respawn system where you can spawn at a different spot in the same area... the chance to leg it or atleast catch your breath would be nice.
---
Yeah but much like Anthem the time line between beta and release just makes them early access.  As the team has no time to do any real changes
---
I have four friend who plays fallout. Zero friends are in adventure, and one is currently playing survival(with me!). According to this survey of people who happen to share my opinions and interests, 100% of players are currently playing survival. Additional facts about the community, 100% of players are having fun and %50 of those players are dressed like Abe Lincoln. 
---
Probably sounds like cheating to most. I only did it that one time. It is a huge pain.
---
Un-Friend.
---
Kill buddy I'm in Discord with.
---
Claim caps you placed on his head.
---
Split caps with buddy.
---
Re-Friend.
---
Laugh at the person we just killed who then paid us even more caps via Bounty system.
---
\*Profit\*
---
I can imagine and a huge ammo sink.
---
By the bunk beds in the Pleasant Valley "fort" area down the road from the ski lodge.
---
Sweet, my house is pretty close OP. I think a pack spawns in that hole down the road with a legendary sometimes 
---
real big problem is those twinks having an advantage over high level players. fully geared twinks are going to be the real cancer
---
Yes, thats what Im saying... lol.
---
Even if you add fletchettes mod, which was the original question, you still have to reload after each shot.
---
My point is try and find a quad explosive and add fletchettes, then it becomes a viable weapon.
---
Quad + explosive + weight reduction + fletchettes mod is the holy grail for this weapon.
---
dying to higher levels really isnt that big a deal until you hit level 50, in which case the real issue is op legendaries. If youre lower than level 50, you dont lose a lot from being killed by higher levels, and you can always just avoid or run from them. its not worth splitting the servers up like crazy and adding this huge inconvenience. 
---
And a risk of hemorrhoid debuff, -10% movement speed
---
I'll be on once the game is done updating. Sounds good. My Gt is The Head Oreo
---
Like cliff racers?
---
Build does matter hence the restrictions i suggested. Even if they wipe the servers in a month newer players will be in the same position as they are in now. 
---
Items dropped during a sitting will be destroyed, taking stress off the server.
---
I have a mod installed that does exactly that!
---
Pretty much. 
---
I have 150 ultracite cores. All max 120% charge. I reload a full core start shooting. I now have 149 full cores and 1 at 119 or less. I keep shooting. Suddenly I'm at 148 full cores and one partially depleted. Bug. 
---
I feel like if it were a permenent event it would lose its charm. Id be happier if some of the daily events ( monster mash, uranium fever, etc.) Became limited time events. Run the different specials for a week with different weird rewards. 
---
The limited time events promote player interaction, since everyone has to be at each event at the same time. 
---
IT'S. A. B.E.T.A.
---
I have bos combat and when I went to see what it looked like in the craft bench it was correct,so it changes when you atually craft it ?
---
Speaking of Luck, I've found about 60 or so Covert Ops Magazines that nullify 50% of a player's VATS accuracy. There are ways to disrupt people's weak "Aim Bot" methods, If anything VATS should cost more AP when used, I'll have to agree with OP that VATS PvP shouldn't be a part of survival or severely taxed AP wise if used.
---
When they play-test against each other they probably don't act like complete savages either, trolling each other with spawn kills and such.  Only way this could have made it into the beta.
---
That's not the experience I wanted. I get really bad anxiety in those intense PVP situations. I want friends and laughter. Something to listen to other than gunshots and the music from youtube I feed through my headset.
---
 Fast travel and get to cover. should be possible, according to this excerpt: 
---
##### Fast Travel and Respawn Invulnerability
---
* The period of invulnerability that’s briefly applied to characters after Fast Traveling or Respawning has been increased.
---
* Firing a weapon before this time expires will remove Invulnerability.
---
Does any of the stuff you want in the Atom shop exist 25 years after the bombs fell (lore wise)?
---
Also, I have seen quite a few of the items you claim "No One Wants" out in the wild, so just frame you statement by what you mean.  "Give me stuff I want, and not what others may like but I don't."
---
I'll take anything that's actually easily visible, dropping loot for low levels and using an array of emotes to try and get them to notice it can be very stressful 
---
Im a melee build anyways. I only use one gun
---
Leader of the Pack over by the Carnival has consistent low level Legendaries.  Server Hop till you get it to pop and repeat.
---
I prefer the 1.25x multiplier of the two shot. 
---
It was just too heavy. 
---
both are good, but quad does more dps over time, even if the two shot version does more damage per shot 
---
Unless you are in Power Armor and have the catheter mod
---
From 76? Uh, okay... I guess older Fallouts don't exist.
---
Thx so much
---
Can you guys fix invisibility because when I'm under the chameleon mutation other players can still see me
---
One gun Bkob always gets his ghoul
---
I'm with you. I've learned to wave at everyone, lest they kill you (not sure why that's a thing), talk over area, share and share alike (check if noobs need anything).  If you want to party, post what console and what quests/events you want.  I started a new character today and everyone wanted to team up for some reason.  
---
Selling outfits of the quick win now. That is why the price of outfit plans are pretty high right now. I spent a lot of hours grinding for the civil war plans but it's great to get 50 caps for 1 cloth and 1 gold (I might be off a little) of crafting 
---
a new player who dies to a higher level bully do lose alot, Lower levels do not have much in terms of caps or Aid, junk . They will lose everything after a few deaths or even one. They usally don't have 1000-25000 caps until later levels.
---
Yeah, to be honest I enjoy Bethesda games I think the copy and pasting from FO4 really is the center of all of the issues for 76. They wanted to build something new and they probably should have started from complete scratch but idk it’s not the end of the world of anything 
---
I've not done this yet but a chap on here says if you change bos combat armor for the bloodied it comes up as tan with a star (chest part)
---
Wes tek does have cryptids, it made the grafton monster and snally gaster, you can find it in terminal entries next to smash tubes, and space station most likely involves the flatwoods monster
---
yeah still mass duping i have seen my guns i sell get sold the next week by the same person 20-30 times
---
Do you happen to know it’s effects? 
---
Ok awesome
---
I would carry no guns if I could effectively tag enemies without one. Until I find a TSE weapon guns don't do any damage really. I can one shot most stuff with melee.
---
On the one hand, that weapon was exclusively used by the DC national guard and has no reason to be in Appalachia. On the other handle, the testla rifle was a one of a kind wunderwaffe created by the most intelligent and powerful raider in Boston, but those are everywhere, so like... fuck the lore, lets make it happen. 
---
so you either think criticising an imperfect system makes you a bad player, or you think that the system is perfect and people criticising it are just bad. bad post op
---
Great movie!!
---
When he is talking about rumors he clearly says he is, hes not trying to fuel hatred he reports on the whats good and bad about the game. Ive been watching all his vids for over a year now and have no problems with them whatsoever, just skip the rumor vids for 76 if you hate them so much.
---
Yeah, the tse was usually a one shot kill, so the higher dps of the quad would only be needed for groups of enemies. 
---
Level 68 muties would clutch their stomachs and say “Oof” and then fall onto their face. 
---
Then again, I was using a 2.5x sneak multiplier too. 
---
I think you will get what you want eventually.  They need to have a continuous stream of new items which appeal to divergent tastes to keep the monetization viable. 
---
Oh damn vats crit strike!
---
What platform are you playing on? 100% agree with you on people, that's the only reason I still play. If you're on PC you can add me, Nephilimelohim, and we can do some nuke runs or something sometime. 
---
Easy there fella I doubt it was made to be a scam. 
---
If you simply issue a ticket and request an Atom Point refund you will find rather quickly they will reimburse your points to your account. At least this is been my experience and the same for several others. 
---
Breathe easy. If you follow those instructions I’m sure you’re issue may be resolved before the end of the day. 
---
Let the \*workshop\* go. After the second kill, log out and go to another server. The only resource that you can get faster through workshops than through exploration/farming is fusion cores. I'm not saying this to justify bullshit PVP griefers, but to point out that you're not being held captive. You have an option that involves not being griefed.
---
Don't throw good money after bad. If you're being griefed, walk away.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's not. Thanks
---
Nope. I only know it says you fall faster. That’s not exactly a selling point for me and my bird bones. 
---
can we get a map graphic to go with it? :(
---
I moved my CAMP to the Ash Heap months ago, very close to Charleston Fire station, and then stayed there fr good. I love the isolated, dead feeling. Sometimes I go the roof of my 4-story CAMP, from where I can see quite far away, and think, "My god. What has this world come to?"
---
They were under a tight development cycle timeline and the game came out too early.  They were probably pressured to pump out the game during the holiday season before other big arrivals, but it backfired because the game simply wasnt ready. If the game released like it is now and with survival mode I think the dynmamic and how we feel about Bethesda making sweeping overhauls or changes would be alot more constructive compared to what we've  seen. 
---
10 without gear. 
---
I think the reason no one goes there is that you pretty much constantly need a gas mask on, or you get disease after disease
---
Only if your approach to dealing with other players is "CHARGE!!!!!!!".
---
I agree with this, Mole Rats are my #1 most hated enemy in 76 just because of the sudden loud noises they make but also because of their teleporting mechanic.
---
Their teleport isn't even good, I can actually watch their model shoot across the ground at high speed before they even finished their animation of digging into the ground, it looks terrible and makes them a chore to kill. They aren't hard to kill, they aren't challenging, they aren't interesting, they are a loud startling chore.
---
Instead mole rats should be more uncommon, but also have a visible den of some kind. They should be slightly less aggressive, they need to be able to be killed while they are digging into the dirt, and they shouldn't be nearly as fast underground as they are right now.
---
Even if Bethesda just fixed their sounds and volume I would be overjoyed, they give me a heart attack every single time they target me, I'm just never expecting it.
---
It’s only for session. At least, that’s what it says in the menu. 
---
explosive weapons knock you out of invuln. I dont understand it. Either way, I'm making it a point to farm those idiots trying to exploit this and farm others. theres usually 2-3 people waiting by whitesprings station for someone to fast travel on every server, and they're sitting ducks with an anti armor gun
---
I mean, the description stated it was a unique paint job. And if you had any doubt about it, you probably should have held off and asked someone first.
---
Like I had the same thought you did but I just decided to buy the bundle.
---
Good on you for giving people a heads up but like you scammed yourself.
---
So basically you defend him because your biased. 
---
The majority of his videos revolve around rumors and he seldom follows up on if they were true or not. 
---
My point is to add the ability to let the workshop go without server hopping - and abandoning other workshops, quests, junk bags, etc. 
---
You don't need a build for sneak. A couple of points in AGL is plenty to gain a massive damage bonus at range. Once you've experienced the stealth bonus, it's hard to resist the temptation when you're solo and carrying a rifle.
---
My current build (second character) is mostly non-stealth non-VATS shotgun rushing, but I'll still thin out the enemies first with sneak rifle headshots. Saves a lot of ammo.
---
Heavy weapons builds probably run non-sneak non-VATS as standard, because you want power armor for Stabilized and VATS burns your fusion cores.
---
U on xbox? i can craft them for u. I just need 150 caps+ mats per leg. 
---
Cool, I roam and farm the waste land and when I find stuff I need I use it only if I’m going to go that route or if others need it I just give it to them. 
---
I’ve literally given a ton of stuff away.
---
Hmm, enclave edition marine armor? Kinda like how they had the different versions in FO4?
---
Me too melee main, I carry a handmade 5.56 silenced so I can mess with stealth sometimes but only in easier areas as it needs too many shots otherwise,
---
I’m still in love with fast moving knife attacks with basic shotgun as backup and for SpamBeasts.
---
I like carrying many knives with varying effects on favourites for different enemies.
---
Ugh... I have a request.  Please tell me everything about Borderlands 3 when it's over.  Thanks.
---
Why does being at the top of the board not grant you any form of benefit, but simply doom you to die, that's the real question. If there was a reward for surviving, then people would be playing games of endless hide and seek trying to rack up whatever it gave you. Instead, you jump off a bridge. 
---
Same. I'm only level 40, but I think it would be fun to have someone to tag along with. 
---
You could be right. I haven't noticed this however I dknt really pay attention as I usually have more cores than I know what to do with. However I almost exclusively use gatling lasers/plasmas so I'll keep an eye out. Maybe only happens to ultracite cores?
---
Not really.
---
Unfortunately there are only so many spots that can spawn enemies &gt;level 50.
---
I'm sure there are probably some good spots that I don't know about simply because they spawn low levels. I would hit up low level events like leader of the pack or any horde event.
---
Thanks for the plans, sorry i took a bit long my controller died midway :P  
---
This Responder recommends your shop and is looking forward for business with you again.
---
kill the queen and pray to RNGesus
---
Here’s a very obscure legendary farming place...  Whitesprings, but nuked! I know, who would have thought that the place with a hundred high level ghouls would have such a good legendary enemy chance! You’re welcome for telling you this most unknown farming spot!
---
I agree, but it should also add rad resist
---
I’ll look later
---
but you lose &lt;100 caps and only a few of the aid you have if you die to a high level player as a low level, whereas the high level players can lose upwards of 300 and half their aid. Besides this, because of how level balance works, a lvl 20 who's farmed low level legendaries can easily contest high level players. really, lvl 50-60s get the worst end of the stick, because theyre expected to be more powerful than everyone else but also cant contest with other's god teir legendaries
---
First customer on the last day, thanks for stopping by! 
---
I did not get to see the bundle before it got taken down, exactly what camouflage skins were included?  If it has the Power Armor skin that is on sale right now included, I might wait for it to come back.
---
He never said he wasn't interested in PvP, he said he'd consider it under the right terms and balancing. You assume too much and yes you do sound like what you think you don't mean to sound like. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, even people who aren't currently pvp-ing. You are not privileged any more than OP.
---
Next time you see a cool build, especially one that's a structure, pause the vid or stare at the photo, and consider, "How would I build this?" Go through the steps involved, as if you're assembling a lego toy. Don't worry about the roof if you don't have the floors done. Try to figure it out step by step. It'll help you learn how to design for something like this.
---
i agree that spawn trapping is a problem however i like loading in with my team at the same place, don't wanna have to go find them every time we FT. 
---
so maybe tams can load in together?
---
i mean i like that the player comes from vault but i dont want to give that imago to the player in end game so it would also be fun to have different textures for the lunch box (atomic shop would be happy lol) or you could find them from different random generated but still relevant places for different boxes like enclave style lunch box could be found in the enclave bunker and raider type raped lunch box could be found at top of the world (was that the name?)
---
However, I believe that Slow Metabolizer benefits both. 
---
I just added you! It’s currently 2:37pm my time lol 
---
That would be cool, i always thought the brown paper bag was kinda sloppy
---
We also need to have a gift emote so that the person knows that I gave them a bag as a gift.
---
Not all explosive weapons are two shot explosive just so you know
---
Here here 
---
I had a bad experience early in the game when I a accepted a team invite and these tools proceeded to travel to my camp and level it and then gank me for good measure.  At the time, it didn’t mean much (lvl 30) but now as a lvl 150 I’m just not interested.  I like chatting and trading with folks but will not join a team.  
---
You can let it go, by not going back to it. Eventually they'll cap it, or get bored and scarper off.
---
Brown bags are such a lazy design too 
---
Ultracite mod plans are awarded for defeating the Scorchbeast Queen. However you may want to check the many containers in and near Watoga Station after the SBQ fight as a lot of folks leave their duplicate plans there - especially in the blue suitcase.
---
Not everyone is on PC.
---
You can read all about Underarmor here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/
---
The Shielded Casual takes 11 ballistic fiber, 15 cloth, and 4 stable Yellowcake Flux. Plus, whatever the cost is for the actual garment you want to apply the lining to. I can provide you a fashion show of the various casual options and you can choose the one you like best.
---
if you are asking the most damage output..that would be bloodied melee or unarmed
---
my friend said he thinks he has a spare one but if he doesn’t i’ll probably pay around 1000-2000
---
You can get same legendary effects even on level 15 weapons and armor. So build doesn't matter as much as the gear
---
You should use periods when you type things.  
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
it's just fucking awful. Like so many PVP modes in so many games, there is zero balance. Unless you're a super high level character, there's no benefit to playing in the game at all. And if you're too high a level, you just dominate people around you. Extremely shitty design so far. The penalties for playing far outweigh any of the benefits. 
---
by way of punishment, I think the designers of this survival mode should be forced to play their own game over and over with low level characters. 
---
I got you! I’m a melee hoarder, so I’ve no doubt you’ll find something. 
---
Yep, still no guarantee that a 3 star enemy will drop a 3 star item. I really wouldn't expect that to change, so you should probably just find a new game that gives you the rewards you're looking for. 
---
FYI - I saw that 2 others today received the same message (identical) in another Fallout group. 
---
They weren’t dupers but picked up stuff they couldn’t even use (one a level 35 and a level 42). Bethesda confirmed they picked items up, ammo in this case but no longer had it and acknowledge that in their tickets. 
---
So not everyone’s a “duper” 
---
Yep, said this multiple times. 
---
haha ikr! i saw on in a bus!
---
Never pay attention to opinions, only facts. It is fact that 76 had technical issues early on. It is opinion that those issues negated any value you might get from the game, because while it bothered some enough to dislike the game, some others are not so affected.   
---
Opinions are valid debate topics, but they are not facts. The sheer number of people who cannot make out the difference is staggering.
---
Just let me know. 1k is fine with me. 
---
Sorry man im on phone. Ill try to make it more readable ;)
---
haha! 
---
What kinds of creatures can you tame? Any type?
---
I just don’t want to lose 300 caps each time I die. May start an alt for it.
---
I mean, as it stands the rewards for participating in the Survival beta are pointless. Oh big woop, a gun that has neither Two Shot Explosive nor Bloodied, hard pass. Imagine how salty people will be if they try to grind for those rewards only to realize the guns they worked for are outperformed on every level by the rampant meta weapons.
---
This is awful reward design. This is associate game designer stuff. Amateur hour.
---
If you want *REAL* rewards, think new CAMP objects. Stuff to let other players know "A raider lives here, tread carefully". Or new skins for weapons and armor. Or signature PvP emotes. Handing out poorly rolled legendary weapons is super lame.
---
Also, they should add new, PvP-only perk cards. As of today, 76 is not balanced for PvP, and Survival is shining a really hard light on that fact. Unless and until Bethesda invests actual thought, actual resources, and people with actual competitive game design experience, I will not engage in this pointless and dumb game mode.
---
What a half-assed waste of development resources.
---
I actually paid 60 for mine pre order. And you're missing my point entirely. Many MMOs have a subscription service. That's a monthly payment of say ten to twenty bucks just to PLAY the game. 76 was a one time payment with all additional content said to be free. The Atom Shop is a big way the team can keep working and adding more stuff to the game after I initial sales dwindle. New content gets new players to buy the game , etc. I really dont need to explain all this to you do I?
---
These aren't changes, these ideas were presented by a large number of people in the community as soon as you announced survival mode... You just weren't paying attention then and you're not paying attention now, just performing lip service. Can I get my refund yet?
---
I've heard numerous people talk in this Reddit  about the spot directly south of white powder sports. I've seen dots there numerous times, have gone there, and the people are never there but the dots remain. 
---
The Marine Tactical Helmet plan's much easier to find, but that burns 24 rubber per vendor, which is a pain when you're also trying to unlock armor mods.
---
With my current character I sell a lot of shotguns because I have Scattershot 3 to lug them around.
---
Aren’t you annoyed by all the cave crickets, and mutie foot traffic?
---
true, there is one at top of the world that i died form at level 25 lol
---
Correct me if im wrong but i'm pretty sure mods for ultracite don't exist, only plans.
---
If you are on PS4 add me DymanicFilms I’ll play with you. Though I’m only level 52
---
Near the north edge the air is clean and I put my CAMP there.
---
1 - carrying over will not make a difference in 3 months there will be new players saying the same thing about people who stated a new character in Survival mode
---
And not even if people have the right gear, it’s if the have right cards too. Yea I get not all cards are for pvp but melee classes unless they have a perfect build have no chance in this game. Except for spawn killing. 
---
Every build should have a chance if not viable (due to how hard it is to balance literally every weapon, effect, mods, etc.)
---
Look, another shortsighted biased suggestion list.
---
4 - why did you take 90 Radaway with you?
---
Sugar Grove and the capitol court house. Both have quite a few fans, typewriters and globes. Also keep an eye out for hot plates, toy cars, and pepper mills
---
I've tamed mirelurk hunters, snallygasters, radstags, toads, dogs, deathclaws, and megasloths. I think wolves are an option too. There might be more.
---
the green camo paint is on it's own. the bundle was in the store because i already got it, it came with camo combat, leather, metal. hunting rifle, a suit (already had the combat and the camo suit from way earlier) also came with a Tan version of the camo paint job instead of the green
---
Its... definitely not a balanced game mode in terms of mechanics and technical issues right now. Hell my first experience with Survival mode was me joining the game for the first time and getting instantly murdered by someone before I could even load in completely.
---
After that I kept getting fried before I could get a chance to heal up or whip out a weapon. My character is Lvl 20, and while the damage scales in combat, it still feels like I cant even make a dent on other players before I get hit with their OP weapons.
---
Alright, thanks 
---
Just use veil of secrets it has a secret affect at acts as a gas mask 
---
too bad you can't take this to school for show and tell...
---
I was disappointed that survival allowed you to use old characters. I'll try again when they change that. 
---
Hopefully this serves as a lesson for Bethesda though, they’re updating the game and being responsive to an extent maybe down the road there’ll be another TES service or another title in the future where they get it right at launch I think they’ll at least try to not make the same mistakes again 
---
Well, I remember a dataminer saying something in the files regarding lunchboxes, mind you this was at the height of the 76 hate so everybody said they would be microtransaction loot boxes. I think that even if they had initially planned on that, they would have abandon the idea  because of all the backlash, so they probably are just sitting on the situation until later. That or they have other future plans for the boxes. From a ingame point of view, it makes no sense for them to he missing, considering the game takes place around a vault-tec school and it's pretty recent since the nukes dropped so looting would still be uncommon.
---
Those are both inefficient variations of the meta. The meta is the handmade with sentinel armor. 3 shots, and anything is dead. You can pull those type of shots in 1.5 seconds, making the ttk much faster. Primary legendary effects don’t matter anymore
---
Commando is just a less efficient handmade user,as in that takes 3-5 hits to kill with an auto. The semi handmade is much better. 
---
The LMG is closer to 5-10 hits to kill. Not optimal. The ttk is sadly lower, and the vats cost is higher. Stagger is not reliable enough to stagger lock players or keep them from lasering you in 1.5 seconds. The game is vats now.
---
I’m saying that there is no such thing as builds anymore. It’s all down to whoever gets their handmade shots off on the enemy first, and whoever duped the most sentinel assassin pieces.
---
I want a cat...
---
I swear, they wont leave you alone no matter how far you run when they are chasing you, they are annoying as hell
---
This honestly makes perfect sense to me. 
---
I do rifle focused build 
---
Be nice to get the scout armor in legendary too
---
I've made several posts about teaming up. I either get snarky responses, I friend people but they're never on/don't want to team up ever, or I get downvoted to oblivion to where nobody even responds. I feels even lonelier when you have quite a few friends on your list and not one is online or the one that are online don't have any interest in teaming.
---
I did alot, I'd say half the players I encountered killed me and I killed the other half so I'm the 50th percentile lol.. no survival is already proving to be hard as hell. I'm over weight on aid and my stash is now full so I may give some away
---
I suspect that’s why all the hate about survival mode now 
---
All these wannabes who got handed their asses are running back to adventure mode
---
But you can’t slap damage anyone in adventure mode.
---
I didnt think anyone can grief you right?
---
Please advise
---
I would prefer Survival mode as it is but with no legendaries 
---
I'm on PC as well
---
Don't forget you still need to build your crit meter. Yeah, great when you crit-smack someone in the head, but then you've blown your load. I'd stick to commando, at least for PVP.
---
I thought with survival mode all the poseurs were gonna leave adventure 
---
Guess it’s back to blocking users
---
Timeline wise. 
---
Yes it would break the lore. 
---
But that was just an example of what I was talking about. 
---
I think clothing and Armor should be based on the uprising of Enclave, BOS, and the other vaults. Maybe perhaps other remnants of other organized institutions. Like the National Guard, the Navy, or other police Departments not yet inducted into the BOS 
---
[This] (https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Ysgramor%27s_Soup_Spoon) is by far the best you can get.
---
I do understand... and I think it is stupid...
---
You are taking disagreement to mean "doesn't understand". Stop it. Learn that people have differing opinions.
---
Honestly the Mothman and Interloper Cults fill that niche much better than just sticking the CoA in another game. I liked them but never understood how they went from their humble beginnings in Megaton to the militant force featured in 4. If their was some lore explaining it it'd be more interesting. 
---
Your right I have forgotten.. idk why but 76 is my fav so far. Prob the hardest with the realest threats!! 
---
If you're on xbone, add me and I will travel with you.

How about you just not play survival??
---
Both you guys, feel free to hit me up tonight, we can get nerdy. I'll be on in about 3 hours.
---
Its sad but I set up my 3 story base with 4 connected ladders in a row to make sure every time I hit top 3 I suicide so I dont lose my valuable aid items, Ive finally gotten a decent amount of caps so thats not my big concern, just the aid items I actually need.
---
Good to know cheers, I'll try server hopping. I had a theory that they'd nerfed stealth to accommodate PvP in Survival (hitting things with hammers being the only allowed strategy) but it seems too random for that.
---
Awesome job. Been thinking about that site. Can you get any walls and floors in down there? 
---
I woulda stood by and yelled things like
---
Get up before you die
---
And when he does, loot his ass then block his GT.
---
True, but some people have certain outfits they enjoy wearing, and not everyone likes the Veil 
---
Sounds like a plan. I'll add you.
---
Is they are willing to go through all that effort and they happen to be in a discord then I guess thata that nut I dont think that the majority would put in that much effort 
---
One's better than none :) can you add me and i'll find you when you are on next 
---
This. The leader of each pack usually counts as a legendary. And the are 3 packs plus a final alpha wolf per event
---
Mics come in handy when trading, so not sure why they are so easily overlooked or discarded?  I don’t always wear it but use it routinely if I need to clarify or chat someone up.  
---
I will be on in 30-40 min after this post is up.
---
Note: For weapon and armor mods, I have a majority of the mods and i'm not sure which ones i'm missing so feel free to ask
---
That's what's getting me. Jesus, this is basically what people were demanding not a few short months ago, FFA PVP, no rules, no limits, more penalty for death.
---
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!?!
---
Survival mode! 
---
Don't know about survival mode but you sure you got the right game? I play 4-5 days a week at 3-4 hours in a go, and it plays just fine for me. 
---
Hot plates were a game changer for me. I never used to pick them up.

The enclave bunker has a pile of desk fans. Mix in a run to a few of the high schools and you should get all the screws a young man could dream of.

Awesome thanks
---
Yeah sure! I’m grabbing dinner so I should be on in a bit! 
---
I got mine off a windigo at Whitesprings.   I like it.  😁
---
I like the idea of the lunch box. In fallout 4 they dropped a random item, maby it was the loot from the last owner. But I don't like the idea of customizing them in the atom shop.
---
I still say remove all legendaries from survival, run on handmade gear. People who claim all the farming they did... you can still use it in adventure, don’t claim you ground 500 hours for survival... it was just announced. Survival is literally all griefing... no skill whatsoever. HEY!!! Let’s all camp the spawn points at stations and one shot you as you spawn in!! 
---
Lol how did I forget about that one... 
---
Toy cars and trucks have them. The cabins near whitesprings has a bunch
---
Assassins and sentinel gear
---
Can’t remember which but lowers the output dmg to you, from other players 
---
It’s straight PvP gear
---
I'm sure they'll get right on that.
---
Yeah where the fuck did it go???
---
That’s fine, but can I ask- doing what? There’s nothin to do after completing the quests, collecting endgame gear to collect more endgame gear is straight up pointless
---
What angers me most is the fact that this mess could’ve been avoided by removing the stacking of legendary effects and fixing the bug (or feature) that makes critical shots ignore all active effects and gives a damage boost that multiplies, preserving the old combat system.
---
They presented us with the “man how about we make the ttk of everything even”
---
Now it’s a game of sniper handmades and sentinel armor.
---
Me too. I never check the random event spawns in the low level areas, I think there's one out there somewhere even though I've never heard from anyone who has one...
---
I mean that's fine, but Beth DID promise an a window of invulnerability to offset this problem then completely failed to deliver. Camping in Fallout isn't something I ever thought or wanted to see.

Can you do calibrated shocks on my ultracite this Saturday at 7:30 am standard pacific time?

 According to the Pentagon Library terminal in the Citadel, mole rats in the Capital Wasteland are the result of an American government program, codenamed Mission Cloacina, to develop an invasive lifeform that could be planted in China, where its aggression and fast breeding would help undermine the Chinese war effort. It is noted that a genetic "kill switch" was included to help the US Army clean up the rats after the theoretical fall of China. Additionally, it is revealed that the researchers attempted to use the Forced Evolutionary Virus to further augment their creations, but dismissed this course of action as FEV had a tendency to render subjects sterile (defeating the whole purpose of the rats' being invasive).
---
Sounds like they are working as intended lol.

Now, you *might* hear some of the audio track from the porn movies I keep playing constantly ....
---
There are assets IN the game files for Owl, Crow, Gorilla, and...something else I can't recall off hand. Came across them a last week when I was datamining heh
---
Why exactly they aren't actually *in* the game, I have no clue. It would be cool to finally see the hooting owl I hear in the distance when I'm in Watoga :)
---
I don’t know exactly because I’m on vacation rn but the  main ones are every rifleman perk so st least 9 perception, every weapon artisan perk, every (whatever perk it is to give you every modification option), the perk that gives you 80% more ammo when I craft ammo, and mostly just quality of life perks. Sorry I couldn’t give you everything but rn I really can’t.
---
I dont sure about that in wearing the light Chest piece right now
---
I know that spot well. Had a gulper swarm on me and they couldnt fit in there after the freeforall they gave me in the small patch of woods just next to this area. 
---
It's not on bruh that's why there's no flames 
---
but seriously that's some nice handiwork
---
Why don't you fix the game first before rolling out more nonsense? You claim the Fasnacht drop rate was working fine, but you showed us stuff we were never going to get. Not cool! Now you have this PvP mode where you drop all your loot and most of your aid making you even more vulnerable. Also the spawning is jacked up because you still haven't fixed the spawning bug that removes everything from the map, forcing you to quit the game. Aka lose all your shit! Also what's up with the Legendary robots automatically exploding when they die? That kills me every time and penalizes me in your PvP mode. Also the game takes forever to load in. I'm taking death damage from a Deathclaw or a Scorchbeast sometimes and I can't move or anything because I'm waiting on the game to correct itself. So dumb!
---
Some people say they can one shot others, others cannot. I can deal 1,800 damage with a black powder pistol, but it only does 80% of the enemies health points in damage. I think fire rate is more important now for survival.
---
No problem thanks lol
---
Making the dropped items easier to see would go a long way, especially in survival
---
Super hero landing! 
---
Technically speaking, how easy is it to change this in game? Is it just an asset change?
---
Jokes on you, i use a mod that makes the bags glowing, i know immediately when someone drops a loot bag. Muahahahaha. 
---
Jokes aside, i never loot other players bags unless they drop them on purpose.
---
Whoops, my bad, I read that as Power Armor, not the standard armor set.
---
just hmu this saturday and ill get back to u ASAP.
---
i spend a lot of my time collecting stuff to give to new players. mostly that of plans, stimpaks and ammo. i also check out other player's camps, sell stuff to vendors and attempt to learn every plan in the game
---
Same here! Then I noticed it was still happening after I moved from a high traffic area to somewhere quieter. I also had a Deathclaw just disappear in front of me, and not the bug where they just go invisible until you load back in.
---
Ok thank you
---
Plan hunting, monster hunting, bounty hunting. Workshop take overs and defense. Helping new players get their feet under them. Looking for the next perfect C.A.M.P. location....
---
I understand now your point. The game plays just fine, you want more content, new quest lines, ect. Sorry I though you were saying the game wasn't working not that you have run out of things to do. 
---
They literally put in camp spots.
---
I do not like this misfeature. It's immersion breaking. I feel climbing on top of crates or platforms or other not-dirt stuff should prevent molerats from bursting up at my feet.
---
Grushnak/90sMemelord. Kicks small children off the bike and smells on the saddle afterwards... this troll scammer bethesda needs to get on this blacklisted guy asap.
---
That’s some good luck right there! 
---
Also note, Here's a map of all the types of vendors.

My God please Bethesda do this
---
You could offset diseases by getting the Vaccinated perk along with being well fed and well hydrated for a boost to your immune system.
---
Nice......but is it lvl 50 Bloodied Swing speed 90% reduced weight?
---
Found the salty boy who feels the need to get attention from Internet strangers.
---
You should think about what you’re writing.  There is no need to have PvP disabled in a nuke zone in a mode newly created for more open-world PvP, other than greed for shiny things.
---
Instead of knives.., what do you think about rocks?
---
Nice one. I’m loving my glowing ore especially in the ash pit but will have to go show The Nexus some love and get some more glowing mods.
---
I think a big problem with making friends came from griefers, where they would team up with you just so they could find your base and destroy it. I had it happen to me a couple of times early on, so I don’t team with unknown players anymore. Hopefully now that survival mode is here, it’ll get to where we all hoped it would be!!
---
&gt;if I were to start a new character, would that character gain atoms from the challenges like the reach level 10, 20 etc challenges?
---
You'd gain the atoms you would gain in Adventure mode, and the challenges are per-account.
---
It would be the same even if they add all the things you requested. It will always be a deathmatch. 
---
Imagine this mode being the only mode at the launch of 76, it would have been a shitstorm.
---
What about camp budget? Mine's maxed out but the thought of having a pet is nice.
---
What is the difference in power between a level 50 and a level 5000000?  Nothing.  You can only re-assign special points and swap out perks, you don't just keep getting more and more and more.    Do you play this game?
---
Cheers, gonna put the CAMP device outside and spend the day pet findin’ :D
---
Yes that happens to be aswell! I'd shoot a burrowing mole rat dead North, and it would shoot up killed out of the ground at South, completely ruining immersion. 
---
Your statement of  "They aren't hard to fight, they aren't challenging, they aren't threatening, they aren't interesting, they are a loud startling chore." pretty much sums it up lol. Fallout 76 could really do without those freaks in this game.
---
I love this idea!
---
i wish for a blueprint 
---
Your issue has been patched. Can you PLEASE TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT THE PLANS
---
hah! your explanation reminds of the movie "it follows" 
---
Eww 😷 is that a special bloodied keyboard 🤢
---
That's good to know
---
I bought the camouflage pack in the atom store and it didn’t give me the camouflage shotgun skin, I got it for my hunting rifle and I got the power armor skins and other armor skins but not the shotgun skin
---
I couldn't agree more, it was after that patch that I dropped my first nuke. I think they nurfed whitesprings nuke zone in that patch as well. Way less enemies spawn there. And I'll definitely hang on to it now that I know I have it lol
---
If I knew how to make one I would.
---
Dang. I guess I haven't been looking hard enough. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Yes are you what's your psn
---
Gorilla is lowkey from the direct port from fallout 4 game files lol that they forgot to delete. XD 
---
All jokes aside, that is pretty cool how all those assets are included, hope they are released live!
---
I use a bloodied explosive hunting rifle with the armor piercing mag, all perks, and a sneak vats crit to the head does not one shot, even players without assassins sentinel. It only takes them down to somewhere between half and two thirds health. Then a follow up shot (non crit) still isn't enough.
---
Even if on PC, still fo76 not moddable as fo4, it needs lots of tools to embed mods in game.
---
Thanks for the advice! I will give this a try!
---
How much aid and weps you carrying?
---
I was climbing the metal stairs on the elevated sky train towers and it popped up 1/2 way to the top... dirt mound and everything! lol
---
No roll back option but I did fix it - remapped in NVIDA Control Panel all my program app customer settings. They didn't carry over as they had always done in the past.  
---
Believe they still benefit from crouch.
---
Thank you, I got worried about not receiving the paint for the shotgun, I hope y’all get it done soon cuz I’m running a shotgun build at the moment and would love to have it match my camo combat armor 
---
you will be surprised how many "rare" material are right under your nose. 
---
When you get older you’ll know I meant the punctuation mark. 
---
I never put it away
---
Is this true with people who have a bounty? 
---
Do you have 5000 bobbypins or gunpowder?
---
I never accept invites from people I don't know because it gives them access to you camp, which in my experience, leads to them trying to destroy your camp.
---
Since release I have always gotten a normal wolf at the end with the 3 1 Star wolves leading up to it. 
---
Did you install any mods? I've been struggling with the same "bug" if I even have a custom.ini in the local directory
---
Great thanks :)
---
That's ridiculous. Someone attacks you or your base. ALT F4. No damage done. Survival is just Fallout 76 free for all mode. You wont make friends there. You take your friends you already have with you there.
---
8 guns and a bunch of aid. Also my stash is almost full even though I only have junk
---
I believe the Queen is guaranteed to drop at least one Ultracite PA mod plan when killed. They can also drop from regular Scorchbeasts, but it's rare.
---
??? Why should the mode be changed because you refused to adapt?
---
Yup lol 
---
If you have friends in the same server or at least teammates, you can just close your app &amp; when you open it back you, you get the “Play with team” option and then when you load back into the club, it should hard reset the enemies. Aka more should spawn. Just nobody can be inside the clubhouse when you’re loading back in or it won’t work.

is it 1:1 scale?
---
Uranium fever has legendary opponents, just be aware if a high level player joins, they will scale up to be a challenge.
---
All of the med recipes range from around 96 to 115 caps with max Hard Bargain equipped.
---
Are you carrying a bunch of gunpowder? I think it's in miscellaneous. It weighs a ton. If you always pick it up and never make ammo, you'll have a lot (and should stop). 
---
Seen this 100 times and I will continue to upvote it
---
Well yeah, most people. I'm pulling \~650 base with my lever action and low health, which WILL drop anyone who isn't wearing armor that negates 95% of all incoming damage, then applies actual armor values in the hundreds to the damage that DOES leak through....It's just one build that makes one-shotting necessary to fight it effectively anyway, so it wouldn't matter to me if it took multiple shots to kill anyone if it wasn't for that... 
---
Defeats the purpose of Survival rewards being legendary items, though, so it'll never happen.
---
Drop anything your not using, and a shit ton of stims 
---
Ah I see you too settled in the Vietnamese rat tunnels, I did it in one of the tunnels themselves
---
Ammo, Aid, junk? I had trouble with aid being overencumbering in my mid game
---
I recently got an AA GA at nuked WS. It's total rng. That's my first good one and I just hit level 100 today. Sledgehammers are comparable, but heavy. 
---
I think they take up the budget of a single turret, I removed one in anticipation of finding a pet. You should try to tame one at max and see if it works still. I have a sneaking suspicion you can have a tamed pet regardless of budget after that patch that changed the cost of things.
---
Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants.
---
So we xan unload all that shit
---
I happen to disagree with that assessment based off my own field work and consensus from some of the pvpers i roll with. Vats is easily annulled with stealth boys for  any cav/ mobile players and a single camo sent piece for opposing snipers or rifleman. You're also talking like everyone just stands around and doesnt make it difficult to shoot them in cover based areas. While of course there is that right now at spawn points, i get that , its not everywhere.  Your argument of this build is meta period there are no other options is flawed because of that. 
---
 Theres so many variables and situational factors that dictate where a build is good. I didnt elaborate further examples because its a much larger list. Take for example the bloodied gamma gun. Easily counters sent assassin users if they run a bloodied low hp build. Unless you've field tested,which i have for every build ive mentioned, i dont think you can say the bloodied lmg build or any build for that matter isnt viable. 
---
Some are more niche others. Some are meant to hard counter other builds.  The bloodied shotgun build with enforcer and a stealth boy is another example of something that can mess with handmades because of the higher stagger proc. 
---
Anyone's idea would of been better than the mess they dropped on us.
---
lowkey i'd much prefer ant spawns than teleporting molerats XD
---
No worries. So can I have a set?
---
Please 
---
That isn't how a bounty works. You should probably learn the system before complaining &gt;_&gt;
---
It is in addition to the caps they would normally drop. Setting up a mule to take the extra caps would be the way to get around the set up, not anything to do with bounties 
---
HAH! lol definitely! "fast breeding" and invasive definitely suits those mole rats!
---
The difference is that level 5000000 has literally every legenary and perfectly min maxxed gear you fucking moron.
---
The place makes me sad. I don't know exactly what it is. It gives me the sad, pitiful feeling of loss that I feel in the Glowing Sea, parts of Boston, outer Vegas, the Washington Monument, etc. These places really just make me sad about how far the world's fallen.
---
My CAMP's mobile, so sometimes I place it there. I _do_ love the contrast of my colourful home in.that bleak landscape.
---
And as a million people have already pointed out, if it was fresh characters, then in a month there would be brand new level 200 characters there along with every brand new level 10 who just bought the game, so your idea is completely pointless.
---
I think just due to the way you worded it, yes it's been around for ages but that doesn't really lessen the creation.
---
Maybe 76 is their first exposure to the Fallout franchise? Maybe they simple just modeled it after the Super Sledge from this game rather than others.
---
If a Final Fantasy fan decided to cosplay a Moogle, and said "Moogle from FFV", yes they've been around since basically the beginning but that doesn't mean they're wrong or need to be called corrected.
---
No. You should really look at the wiki before resorting to coming here &gt;_&gt;
---
A weapon can't be two shot and instigating, as they are in the same slot. 
---
No. Two shot is a primary modifier. Instigating is primary, Explosive is secondary, so a TSE is real, and IE is real, but a TS and I cannot combine. 
---
Nope, there is instigating explosive though
---
I'll take the laser pistol -- is it lv 50?
---
Isn’t that the exact center of the map?  I thought I remembered hearing once that the dots sometimes display there if the servers are being slow when someone logs on and then later updates to their actual location.  Not cheating, just Bethesda’s servers not working well
---
Grab cards that reduce weight and sort your inventory by WT(weight).
---
People have given good suggestions already, focus on the weapons you use, get rid of nukes and missiles, gunpowder, extra food and drinks, bulk it all. Farm plastic to bulk 
---
Basically start focusing your build, weapons and armor and even ones for aid and food
---
With the game arguably being $30, you've paid $150 for a bunch of skins up front.
---
I chose to buy the game at $30 and splash a few bucks every now and then.
---
You should probably avoid online gaming, your not going to have a good time :^ )
---
Suggest wait for Fallout 5, or Elder Scrolls assuming they ship offline SP only.
---
it wasnt really gamebreaking for me, just annoying af. I just got sick of killing ghouls at WS. I mean, farming late game is cool and all, but they kinda made it so there was only one place to farm. I am kinda missing it tho. 
---
So you're telling me that using a broken legendary trait, and exploiting the perk system to make yourself literally unkillable, is a perfectly balanced and fair experience?
---
That would be perfect, just basic marine armor with an enclave paint would be better than what we have now
---
Hmmm...maybe that's it. Maybe you just have to push your damage ridiculously high because it is reduced by a flat percentage or something. We REALLY need to know how this damage reduction works, and so far Bethesda isn't telling us and I haven't seen anyone publicly stating they have figured it out. They do say in the patch that it would "Severely reduce the likelihood of being killed in one shot". Maybe they just meant "It's going to take a lot more damage to do it because of how we are going to scale damage the first time you do any to a player."? Guess my 2-shot lever action just won't cut it any more, although my Dragon with over 700 base damage SHOULD be getting the job done with a crit. Very strange...
---
Sea of Thieves had that same issue for a long while until Alliances were put in and they added reasons to work together.  But they didn't want to separate the PvE/PvP players by doing different game modes (until now when they're working on an Arena mode I guess).  
---
Survival mode though in its current beta state is basically just the PvP mode right now.  No real reason not to shoot others.  
---
Sounds good, but it'll get infested with duper stuff and become a grief fest all over again.  But it is an improvement over what exists now.
---
If you just started, keep as much plastic as you can to bulk stuff with. It does help a lot with weight.
---
On what system did this madness take place?  It looks like Xbox maybe?  I had only one parade fail because someone used a mini nuke from a distance against the robots.  
---
I think they should change the targets from longest life to people with the most player kills. The player kill count should reset every day and not on relog so the more people you murder the greater the chance you have a big ass Target on your back until the next day. Plus, if you go under 0 on caps you should start dropping a random item per death including armor and weapons. So the bigger of a murdering ahole you are the riskier it gets. This also makes running with 0 caps a bad idea.
---
When you become less boring you’ll realise I was 🙃 joking
---
Consider focusing your weapons down to a class or two, then equipping cards that reduce their weight (rifles excluded because Bethesda reasons) Travelling Pharmacy will strip your aid tab of a lot of weight. Bandolier will fix most of your ammo weight problems. Clear your stash out of a lot of junk, but I wouldn't just dump it, figure out what a reasonable quantity of each would be to keep in stock and sell off the rest to vendors. This all will take a few days, but you should be able to get your self easily into the 150-200  personal weight territory if not lower, and get your stash down to 600-700. 
---
Players like that are why I'm not playing fo76 until I can create a private server and play on my own. It's just not worth the stress.
---
That is completely irrelevant to you carrying 90 Radaway with you. Plus there are ways to counter it, use them.
---
Reported for name calling/harassment.   You literally just don't know how the game works.  Just put in teh hours everyone else has put into the game. And don't take these reddit upvotes seriously, this reddit sub is known to be a bunch of carebare crybabies that do not reflect the community, thats why you keep getting ignored when actual patches come out.  Legendaries are not that hard to come by.  Back to farming them, later bro
---
/u/Ladydevann pls shed light, we are in the dark over here...
---
I guarantee I won't have fun in a 1 on 1 duel with you on my 91 character or my 11 fresh character started in survival. Your hundreds of hours of Two shot Exploitsive gameplay is not fun for anyone under 50 and with terrible weapon drops. 
---
Of course the 197 that one-shot me 10 times in a row with his tesla gun is having more fun than the level 11 already at 0 caps and stored droppables. It's for psychopaths.
---
I know right ?- periods are so funny and icky too.  😷 
---
I always stash it
---
Sell aid for caps, how often do you use it?
---
Good to know, thanks I hadn’t thought about that one
---
That door in the space station? You mean the keypad one with the spacesuits in it? You can open it right now, there's a note in the area with the passcode on it.
---
Nope
---
This would be fantastic, pains me they're not included
---
I did watch Neil’s first steps on black and white tv at little school, does that make me old enough for you son 🚀 
---
It could also just have been inconsistently implemented.
---
Yup, scrap, sell or drop weapons that do not fit build.
---
Nuke grenades, cool yes, fit build no.....sell or scrap.
---
Honestly even though it was my favorite event so far, I would rather it be an annual thing. Just knowing it was limited time join in or miss it heightens the anticipation for me
---
I think ScreamingBee Audio has a free trial.
---
Wdym bulk?
---
If you play a low level char in survival mode, don't complain when you get pwned by a lvl 200.
---
Survival mode is basically a giant death match. As long as they allow switching back and forth, just level in adventure mode. If you choose to step in the arena for a 20% exp boost, don't bitch if you get killed. You knew the danger.
---
U can I was completely full on budget when I tamed my deathclaw 3 days ago
---
It also has some of the best environmental storytelling.  The way the Hornwright and Garrahan Estates loom on the horizon, the air purifiers that do the complete opposite, the futile rooftop planters in Lewisburg.  As a location, the whole thing gels together.  It's just too bad there isn't more stuff going on there.  Much like Toxic Valley, you simply out-level it, although the Ash Heap can occasionally offer battles with multiple Scorchbeasts at once.
---
&gt;  DO NOT ALLOW US TO CARRY OVER CHARACTERS. We said this innumerable times and Bethesda didn't listen, now look at the state of things 
---
They didn't listen because there is  a shitload of us who want to carry our characters over.  Your post demonstrates that there is another shitload of people who still can't grasp that fact. 
---
Bravo and an excellent read. I felt a familiarity when you described the sensation, being hunting and being hunted. I made some caps but got wiped twice by 3 man groups. I had so much fun. It gave things this immersive depth. The fear and risk was real. My first kill was crossing the road near the creamery. It was 1 on 1 and so much fun. I then became #1 and got chased all the way to the lumber yard. Even though i got killed it was akin to the sensation of playing "chase " as a child. I was giggling and smiling. Sure, I wish they changed this or that but I'm confident things will get ironed out. I was using my lucky vats thug build. No damage resistance perks except fireproof and adamantium. I'll def be giving it another go tonight. 
---
Everyone thinks you're a fuckboy. GTFO
---
Yes the latest change is great and long overdue. Pacifists shouldn’t be able to take damage from the beginning period. They really wanted to force everyone into killing each other, I’m glad the community has won. 
---
Thanks for the response and sorry I've wasted your time by asking such a trivial and obvious question.  
---
Want to know the fucked up part? I did. When I got my account back a couple weeks ago. After having it having for like 5 days I figured I'd give Bethesda some money and support the game I loved. I got banned again the next day. Fuck me right?
---
I wrote 4000 word long guides for this shit community. I've deleted every one and won't be doing more. If you want to know how to turn fans away from your already garbage product, it's ban the content creators. I'm just a small fish. Look at fucking ARK. I could easily make a video highlighting the game breaking bugs in 76. 
---
You can go to a Tinkers bench and bulk your scrap so it makes it lighter and you’re able to sell those bills at vendors
---
to expand on that, unless you're dead set on big explosions, just dump all explosives, they weigh far too much for what they accomplish.
---
Commie whacker
---
&gt; was level 80 before I ever got my hands on a legendary weapon
---
It IS sad. It’s sad because it’s man made and it feels very real. 
---
I’d say it feels real because there’s real life areas that they could actually look at.
---
I could see creating new gear with an emphasis on pvp stats.  Players wouldnt' have to lose their current gear but gear that is better for PVP could help shift the balance
---
Maybe they didn't make this game for tryhard major league gamer wannabe asshats like you?
---
Not I.
---
There are several perk card that will help as people have said - bear hands, strong back, Power user (I think) reduced power armour weight, bandoleir (reduces ballistic ammo weight)  etc.
---
Make sure your scrapping your junk not just storing it as is.
---
Decide what you like and what you NEED. If you don't really use it then loose it, sell it to vendors or just drop it. It is one of the hardest thing to do!
---
If your stash box is full of junk amd nothing else then I would say your probably not using it for anything. Bulk everything up them sell the bulk items to vendors and just save around 4 or 5. When you bulk something it has a minimum of 10 units all the way up to 30 units for less rare items like wood and steel so you don't need many bulk items to actually have a lot.
---
Also as others have said don't carry round loads of heavy ammo unless you really intend to use it a lot. It's so easy to collect 15- 20 missiles without thinking about it too much. Also fusion cores are really heavy. only carry 2 or 3 as you can make fusion cores at power plants when you run low or just pick them of empty PA suites that sporn
---
Sounds like you need to go to nexus mod and grab the lunch box replacement mod
---
I agree to all of this. Which is why I hope the ash heap gets some content added to it. 
---
Aid items can build up fast, especially chems. Notes like plans are also relatively heavy. Mininukes and cores too.
---
u wont be able to max out either bloodied or the rifle perks..the way this game is designed is that u can really only max out one build
---
source: rifle build
---
You come up with that all on your own? 
---
KYS troglodyte. 
---
Damn, I forgot to equip Fireproof for that BURN.
---
They are actually, damn you must be a blast at parties. Bodily functions are hilarious in all their variety, do you ever listen to the comedy greats.
---
The irony with your name is killing me man 😂
---
Yes, and the eater will burp afterwards.
---
Try completing these quests with a pump action shotgun. I was unable to do any of them with pipe pistolrifles, but my first try with a freshly looted pump did the trick. 
---
VATS is your friend..mole rat chunks are actually an excellent source of food..also if you have the recipe..u can also create mountain hocks
---
It'd also introduce other problems like low level players being spawn camped around the vault and hunted around the forest. Introducing it with a range of levels makes sense. 
---
No, I haven’t heard any comedy greats.  I’d love to check some out.  Which are the ones that talk about periods again?  
---
First thing i did was pack up my base. Every time i moved to a new area i would only unpack what i needed- then immediately store it again. My camp was just an over head projector machine thingy. I was still able to fast travel to it and use it as a respawn spot but I never got anything destroyed. Screw walls and all that. It was a less appealing Target because it consisted of nothing. Sorry your experience sucked. Fiddle with your build and go off the meta route. I used mixed math 3 star armor, no damage resistance and no explosive weapons although i do have one. I had a different experience than you and i enjoyed it. The 3 man squad thing is a bit much to compete with..
---
Well, look at it this way... if the Survival rewards were actually unique and worthwhile, we'd probably throw a fit that they weren't available in Adventure mode.
---
Woah, it's not like I can't kill a protectron at watoga for 200xp. Good job finding it but it's a waste.
---
Great job making EVA foam and PVC look like battle worn metal.

Hawke's Refuge on The Mire/Great Divide border has a very good chance at a legendary in the 35-40 region. I farm junk and water there pretty often, as it's close to my camp, and roughly 5/10 there is a 3 star legendary, sometimes its just a glowing one or Wendigo instead though. 
---
I've cleared that place at least 70+ times. It's just north of Sugar Grove and west of Harpers Ferry.
---
I didn’t mean making friends in survival, I meant the griefers leaving to go over to survival. Rereading what I wrote, I can see how that wasn’t clear lol. 
---
I’m not sure what ALT F4 does (I’m on Xbox). Does that take you back to the menu? If so, I’m not a fan of server hopping. Not that I have a problem with people that do it, I just don’t like breaking my immersion in the game world if I can help it. I’ll still trade with people on the road, and have tons of fun at events, I just won’t team up with people I don’t know. 
---
They don't exist in the year the game takes place. The Church of the Children of Atom wasn't founded until Megaton was constructed, and in 2105~, the town would still be a bunch of people hiding in a crater near an active bomb.
---
So unfortunately the law doesn't allow it. But hey, Gamma Guns exist, so maybe they could say that the Children of Atom are a pre-War cult, like the Cult of the Mothman. That could work.
---
It will eventually make it to PvE or one of the websites. 
---
But that 20% XP bonus is the real draw for level 100+, right?
---
I kept myself to myself, never even knew what they were untill I actually started doing events. Plus remember when the game first launched and you could level up by just discovering a new place haha. 
---
Pretty sure I got to level 40 in my first week 
---
Last I checked, bulking only saves weight for lead and steel. Has this changed recently?
---
Ya that would be cool because if I see a low level player I'll give them a welcome to the wasteland package filled with a bunch of nessasries to survive such as rad x rad away water food and bullets and if I have a weapon or armor they could use that to. So to anyone that's just starting or is about to start fallout 76 on ps4 look for Biglokote509 depending what I have u might get a lil or might be well off after our encounter good luck everyone
---
Yea save the planet, no more paper !
---
When was the first time you played it? Just curious since from my perspective it seems like they just 'turned off' the 3-star at the end at some point.
---
True, i don't know why everyone wants pvp to be this boring ass baby thing when it's designed as a playground for those who have beaten the game and have bad ass builds and gear. Gives us something to do and let's the pve and rp players take workshops on adventure mode.
---
I think they should remove the concept entirely. Survival this way, with leader boards seems more like a novelty than a survival server where you can also actually play the game.
---
Did you just delete the ini?
---
Oh man yes! Rocks and wooden armour as battons, we should all have enough wooden armor.
---
Cans of dog food, they are everywhere.
---
CM [said on the forums](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/331466/camo-bundle-temporarily-disabled-in-the-atomic-shop?language%5B%5D=en) that it was temporarily taken down because of a bug.
---
Well not trying fully max bloodied since I probably won't use the player much but that good to know thank you.
---
They need to figure out who this game is marketed to in the first place. 
---
It sure as fuck is not fallout fans. This is not an RPG. Its a looter shooter. Set in Fallout. With specific hard design limitations to stop you playing exactly like other fallout games. 
---
I haven't noticed it generally, but when I was doing the "Take photos at mines" challenge last week, there was one location, I think it was Kerwood Mine, where they just kept coming and coming.
---
I'm sure those purchases are in the pipeline and we just don't know it yet.
---
They're not shying away from doing this as ham fistedly as they did Oblivion's horse armor.
---
It won’t let me sell my scrap
---
not that one, the one that's unaccessible
---
By then, see ya PeeFarts 😂 
---
(I'm new to Reddit so feel-free to downvote me if this isn't the appropriate place to do a side-bar like this)
---
I, too, get those. Assuming we're talking about ones that recover after a random amount of time?
---
If so, are you also on a Ryzen powered machine?   
---
There was a thread that someone made about it awhile back where I had been keeping a tally of my own problems on it. Charleston was completely off-limits for me, as when I got close, multi-minute long freezes. Cropped up during the, I'd say January patch. Finally went away as of v1.1.0.8 though! That being said, now I experience it during Scorchbeast Queen fights as of the last few days (not sure about yesterday's patch yet). I thought perhaps this issue was my own doing from heavily tweaking my system's RAM (really tight timings), and so I need to relax it a bit to determine if that IS the case, should the latest patch still present it.
---
However, back to my question. I ask because of all the people in that thread who did mention their system specs, the one commonality between us all was a Ryzen CPU. I have a 1700X, I think the OP's was a 2700, and I think someone had a 2600 as well. 
---
Thats what i was doing while I did some more research. If your deadset on modding the custom.ini you can get from better inventory works if you install mods manually
---
Not really a concern for me since it's just junk that's dropped, but I see where you're coming from if you were carrying a lot.
---
This is why I don't PvP.
---
I'd like to have a few battles for run, or attempt revenge on ppl who take my workshops, but not worth the cost.
---
I am guessing your in the minority based on the drop-off overall in the game.  Back before TSE nerf and white knight nerf the game was amazingly active with nukes on every server pretty much you joined within 30 minute regularly.  Bethesda keeps tweaking things that is obviously taking away from the enjoyment many got from it,  they lessened progression in many ways and created so many smaller nerfs of things to slow players down, I understand balance, but I don't think they do.    That's why allot just stopped because they no longer were enjoying themselves.  Coming in now you would not know this.  I would assume that most that left if they did still come here, that has dropped off.  Not nearly as many complaints now because most moved on..  I keep my eye on things just to see what is going on.  
---
Doesn't stimpack stacking work anymore....oh, that's right 
---
Ah good, thanks.
---
im surprised u never encountered a legendary enemy..or maybe u did and did not realize
---
Why exactly did everyone before want to start with new characters? And why is it that now that it's out people with the same complaint are now being smeared on for it?
---
Its not the case with everyone. I  invited someone to my team, he took me to his camp and I didn't do that. In fact, I built more stuff he wanted. But I think people like these need to be named and shamed.
---
Seemed like that's where you were going when you mentioned the adapting bit
---
They could have put it in a wooden crate or a blue plastic barrel.
---
I guess I'm overlooking the value of the XP bonus. I'm at a point where I have 10 level ups banked..... I'd have more but I had to level my 3 intelligence to 5 for a weapon mod and then back to 3. Once you've got your build dialogue in it's not even worth the time to sleep in a bed for a minute to get that 5% XP boost.
---
I have not tried it yet, I sat in front  of the launch screen for a few minutes last night debating whether it was worth my time, and pussyfooted out! I can't trust that the balance is there, and I didn't sign up for this kind of game play, I  liked it the way it was. This game title is not Mad Max Fallout76 Road! I get why it was added, but in the same regard it is kind of a slap in the face to people who just want to play the game and now if you want to be rewarded with extras you are forced into playing the PVP version of the game. So much for building a healthy environment in game. I guess I put my time in, over a thousand hours at this point, I think it may be time to move on to something else, with no disrespect to the Dev Team. I supported the game through thick and thin, I feel along with others we made the game what it is. In my opinion, this seems like a desperate attempt to get people who do not belong in this game to start playing it.  I don't know what to think at this point, other than this game has lost its direction. I wish everyone the best!
---
I started with release, took about two months off, and I’ve been playing again since the break so who knows what happened in the middle there. But when the game came out I would do that event all the time for the 1 Star wolves so when I came back I did it with my new guy and it was the same. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
If you want xp instead of a scavenger hunt
---
Super mutants *can* drop screws
---
Not 100%, but it’s an option
---
I'd suggest getting the vault 76 backpack instead. The lunch box is a dynamic object so it can fly away if someone or something explodes 
---
C'mon, look at that weapon, doesn't worth the effort.
---
&gt;Plus there are ways to counter sent, use them.
---
I want to go there just to get killed and put a 10,000 cap bounty on someone’s head.
---
I've added a suicide ramp on my camp to get myself off the leaderboards.
---
They took the bundle down temporarily to fix it. Ask for a refund to be applied to the bundle one re-released. 
---
Bulk your scrap at a tinker bench.  Then you can sell it.  
---
Looks like you simply do not have enough time. Good luck next week. Welcome to shitty weekly challenges. 
---
I didn't install it personally but I thought it just reskined it
---
Their goal was to stimulate PvP encounters...kinda backfired, huh?
---
Lmao. Hopefully they get their skins back
---
Definitely go in with very low level to limit cap loss but expect to die often.
---
The other day during Faschnacht some dude was running around with his mic hot and what sounded like 6 screaming kids in the background. Everyone kept telling him to mute his mic. I just muted him.
---
From a gameplay perspective, it sure would have made sense had they given us all a lunchbox while exiting Vault 76 so we had a way to carry all our stuff around. If we die, it drops with our stuff in it to retrieve again.  If it's looted without us, it's just assumed we respawn with it empty.
---
Preach!
---
Oh wow I didn’t know thanks!
---
Or fast travel to a place close by in adventure mode then switch to survival since you will be at the last location you logged from and then kill them all. Or just explore reaping the xp boost benefits. 
---
Wishful thinking lol we have magic maps that show players lol
---
Lead and aluminum, not steel 
---
Yea, balance the game solely around pvp... again. How bout they just stop buffing and nerfing legendaries. The game is more than pvp. Everytime they adjust damage outputs based around player stats, the pve community suffers. Player stats are incredibly small compared to the rest of the enemies in the game, which are slowly becoming bigger bullet sponges. Why dont they just buff player health, itd be easier then micro managing every legendary, and would be beneficial to both sides of the fence.
---
Because it's a paintjob?
---
And BoS is a paintjob?
---
And you can't paint a paintjob???
---
Cryo grenade, them iridium rifle
---
That's exactly what happend. I think I picked one up realise I couldn't scrap it and it sold for way less caps than standard gubs so I just ignored them for ages untill I went into my first blast zone and saw a guy with an explosive shotgun and I was like " Dude WTF is that" and he told me and I felt like such an idiot haha 
---
Same as this. I'll be only in an hour or so.
---
I vividly remember there being a 3-star at the end of it, but then again the mind is a fickle thing and I might just be stupid. Still it doesn't rly make sense to have a bunch of 1-stars 'bosses' leading up to a 'no-star' boss. Hopefully some bethesda employee will clear this up for us.
---
This is no where near game breaking. This will take more time to do than leveling organically
---
great source of protein!
---
Sprint, jump, vats melee....
---
Haha i woukdnt go near it unless you want banning 
---
That’s a super cool idea 👍 😎 💡 
---
If you play on pc you must be the person that rarely makes me have to switch servers because of camp collision.
---
Charleston FD, AVR, random spawn point, rusty pick,  placed weapons, power armor and core galore...
---
No neighbors. 
---
It's a good location.
---
Wait, Black Powder Rifles scale with level? Rn I'm lvl 30 and I've only found level 15 black powder rifles from the phillipi battle cemetary
---
Nah. It's just a model replacement
---
No.  They don’t appear to be. 
---
I'll be looking into the Marine &amp; scout armors soon.. Anyone have any insight on what to tweak so I can get the facial textures back to normal? Drivers are all up to date so that's not the issue
---
If you're not using it, drop it or if it's tons, try selling it for a little on the marketplace 
---
The Gourmands can just leave a corpse as their lunchbox. 
---
Look for Leader of the Pack. 3 guaranteed easy legendaries every time. And it comes up a lot too. I think you have to avoid doing the horde leader mission though. 
---
Ahh dem days
---
its cool bruh..ppl were amazed when i told them that i was 100 hours in and only level 30
---
Precisely. Why would they pass up a revenue opportunity ?
---
I didn't. I saw about half a dozen guys there (on the map) and decided to travel to see what they were doing. Turns out they were underground (or above). 
---
My build doesn’t either. That said, thought I’d give it a go anyway.
---
Spent 30 minutes trying to rearrange my stash to accommodate all the meds I didn’t want to lose, selling off some heavy 1* leg weapons I’d been keeping for Leg Vendor, etc and then hopped into a survival server, from my CAMP location.
---
First thing that happened was the usual ‘your camp can’t be placed’ message. Figured that actually worked in my favour as I didn’t want anyone attacking it.
---
Which did mean, however, that someone else’s CAMP would be in the area - and lo and behold, there it was. 
---
So took some shots at it, hoping it might lure the owner out to make repairs at which point I’d Rambo them with my 50 cal and make some cashmoney.
---
As expected, the owner appeared. And then I kind of felt bad for shooting his camp. He must have spotted me as he started running over, at which point I virtually shat myself and dropped off the server.
---
Nope, don’t think I like it. 
---
Will try again tomorrow. Think I just need to get over the getting killed thing. Have nothing really to lose, spent all my caps, dumped all my junk and stored all my meds, so it’s just my dignity and sense of well being on the line :)
---
And you've wasted more of his time making him read your reply you monster./s
---
 "Human meat is the most ethical meat, because only humans can communicate consent". I laughed way too hard at this! Great post!
---
I’m lvl 126. Losing 268 caps a death. You mean to make an alt? 
---
So thats 6 guys soon to be banned lol you would assume Bethesda would have learnt by now. OR it could be the development team have a play lol 
---
Lone survivorS?
---
Ha!
---
Wrong sub bro
---
yeah i realized in this game if u wanna try out different builds..its best to have multiple characters..my main character was all over the place..but my alt has way better perk cards equipped..im considering if im gonna do bloodied next or a shotgun build..not sure..maybe both..haha
---
I mean, you can also craft a wood wall destroy it and craft it again. 
---
Well, considering that people have reported multiple players selling dev items and duped items for real money on various websites, and they are still playing... I wouldn't count on it.
---
That's much more accurate.  I think Bethesda should give players complementary  ultracite plans of their choice  to anyone that kills the queen but does not get  a chance to loot it. 
---
If a player kills  the queen to farm ultracite plans and they succeed but are denied a chance to loot her, Bethesda should compensate that player. 
---
Yeah I know never gonna  happen. 
---
But this is insult to injury on the most base level. 
---
Lol, you spent all that time prepping just to DC when he started to run over to you? Yikes...
---
That's why they need to implement a system where your character stays logged in 10 seconds after you DC. You shouldn't be able to run like that.
---
All 3 satellite locations around there are pretty good for screws and springs
---
Thanks for looking out
---
Or craft and scrap any food plant...
---
Anyone else noticed that Scorched, Super mutants and robo brains events you need to search, the rest seem to spawn where the event starts.
---
Yep, but I realise being up against these Uber builds with legendary weapons is impossible really, best wait to see if they balance Survival a bit.
---
Too expensive at the moment.
---
Just curious, what's the deal with the double periods?
---
thank you!
---
VATS does require skill but I agree should not be used for PvP.
---
Bloodieds, sentinel, unyielding, chameleon, instigating, suppressor, power armor, tse......NONE of these require skill either. 
---
Why u hung up on vats?
---
Lots of chill people play on PC. If you have high chrisisima and share perks people will want to team up with you... 
---
i learned so much from this (serious) thx
---
i think it may be partially because of you burning up your AP too fast, try again with controlled smaller jetpack bursts
---
There is a mod for that, https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/258
---
Thanks a lot, but i play on PC, but that's ok cause i wont be using my main on Survival mode anyway, i made a second char just to play him exclusively there.
---
lol they are called *ellipses*
---
You can find one on any 76 trading forum, like Market 76, who are vetted and will help for a handful of caps. 
---
I am on PC. So you must be the guy who made me go "Who the hell CAMPs in this godforsaken place apart from me?" thrice in all this time I've played...
---
My CAMP is beside the small lake, 2 minutes from Charleston Fire station.
---
Wait where is the Core spawn point? I am running a bit short...is it the Firebreathers one you are talking about?
---
I maxed out both. All 3 rifleman perks, almost all damage increasing perks. I am doing 1300 with my bloodied dragon and 1200 with bloodied explosive harpoon, because also have all 3 heavy weapons perks. Only 1 10% melee damage perk doing 958 with bloodied grognaks axe, and 250 with bloodied Mr handy. Every kill goes up 10% damage for all weapons up to 60% extra. I wear unyielding armor. 
---
Source: Bloodied, Adrenal Reaction, Heavy perked, Rifleman perked, non-melee focused destroying machine.
---
Dude, seriously, your using his hitting a bong as an indicator he's a jerk. Well here's a little enlightenment. I'm 50 and have smoked weed for 35 of those years, I'm also a Dudeist minister and a pacifist, I have killed 1 player in the game in 800+ hours and that was a request to rid him of a 5 cap bounty. I am constantly helping every player willing to accept my help and always dropping plans in Flatwoods for lower level players to find. If you think someone who's a pot smoker is automatically going to be a pain in the ass your way off the mark.
---
I believe it's a throwback to the original Fallout game, either when you die or drop an item it would drop in a paper bag. 
---
Yeah, some people just don't like people so you gotta figure someone would just want to be their own little faction. 
---
It’s still there, the camo is just doing really well at blending in
---
But ellipses are 3 periods in a row, and aren't used to replace periods. Why would you use an ellipses after every sentence? Is there a purpose to it? 
---
That's... Look, I don't want to insult you, but that's a really stupid thing to say.
---
&gt; magic maps that show players lol
---
Wut??
---
They're not... That's so dumb. Next you'll say that a player's name appearing above their head is magic, or that player icons are magic, or the HUD is magic.
---
It's a VIDEOGAME. Not everything the player sees actually exists in that fictional world. The character you play as doesn't see the heads up display, player icons, player dots. 
---
Seriously, dude
---
Is this your first ever videogame??
---
&gt; Same money I was making at level 30. It's not like vendor caps limits go up or anything. 
---
You know, this simple sentence is genius actually. Vendors caps limits could go up with level, just like our camp budget. 
---
Ironically my solution was to only spawn in CAMPs. They can't really be camped effectively, due to that whole individual thing. 
---
If you have to go somewhere else either walk or look for an event. You can still fast travel to events as normal, but the spawn point isn't as obvious and the likelihood of camping thus decreases significantly. Most events have protection keeping you from killing other people doing the event, as well as locating them for you. 
---
Workshop system is the same so he could capturing them or just being so annoying people shoot at him flagging them for pvp I dont know it is hard to pvp outside of the workshops in adventure most people run with pacifist mode on.
---
Yeah, does seem to be a bit of an exploitative flaw really.. 
---
there is an option in the social menu to block permanently, their should be 2 "block" option's one is block for session the other is just block.
---
What, and we've just got 900 Vault-Tec lunch boxes in our pocket to discard whenever we feel like it?!
---
i like the idea of a new form of represemtation, but i find it hysterical that fatmans and missle launchers are capaple of fitting in those small bags lol
---
I just thought the plural singular was funny. 
---
You know? Like on Airheads? Lone Rangers!
---
...God I'm old
---
Guys, obviously they use paper bags unclaimed plastic lunchboxes would never degrade and eventually to end the pollution on survival servers they would have to create a plastic armor set, which would bug out and just have random junk items sticking to it everywhere
---
very true 
---
Well done! See ya there!
---
Yea, that was my exact assumption as well on Gorilla. 
---
There's no hiding all the stuff that came from FO4 as their archive directories weren't even changed! lol Plenty of things which have base directories of like "dlc03" or "dlc06", which I found kinda comical that they didn't even take the time to do any house-keeping. (Sure it'd mean editing other files to point them to the new location to find assets, but would be less confusing in the end.)
---
Any idea where to find a list of primary/secondary modifiers?  I have this same question so many times
---
So does that mean my non pvp character is completely useless after this update?
---
Just keep trying to login each day, don't give up.
---
Pretty sure the main issue, besides the spawn camping, is the Legendary weapon/armor system that completely ruins the entire mode. Maybe...just maybe, they disable legendaries in the mode, the game would be more interesting to play, as it levels out the entire playing field without crazy reductions and insane "bloodied Dragon 5k damage gg no re lol!" encounters. Just a thought. As for the legendary weekly rewards, well! That's easy, have the items sent to the main character you want to give it to in adventure mode as an awesome reward. 
---
I think I'm going to cry. Nobody has treated me this harshly before. Thanks for having my back bro. 
---
I feel like a raider, but that's because I'm raiding mines, and eating the mutated miners.
---
Is every explosive a TSE to you?
---
It's probably either server lag or a new speedcap implemented secretly, [some smart folks have been able to make some good flights with this method](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b4x51r/flight_to_monongah/)
---
It's worse now, as they find out how lame they are in survival they come back over to gank low levels to make themselves feel better, and the only players who could curtail them are happy over there with the new level of challenge.
---
Bulk and sell any junk you rarely use. If you ever need stuff you rarely use and don't have enough, you can always go find enough. Don't horde weapons that aren't sentimental.
---
Turn pacifist mode on and don\*t capture a workshop and you never have to worry about pvp thats what I do there no slap damage anymore so unless I capture a workshop and then try and defend it if someone trys to capture it off me there is no way I can get into pvp in adventure mode.
---
That means you need to go to a tinker bench, bulk it, then you can sell the bulks
---
Awesome summary, i like your thoughts and i agree with most of it. I got rinsed the first time and lost my meds but i look forward to giving it another try with a new mindset. 
---
Awesome video too,makes it a bit more fun 
---
If I remember, on EveOnline if you DC during a fight your ship persisted and would just sit there and get popped.
---
Traveling pharmacy at level 3 will definitely help you if you're a hoarder and probably don't use slot of the checks you've been picking up along the way. 
---
Also True Hiker will reduce food and drink weights. 
---
When you try to login, unsuccessfully....what does that tell you?
---
Keep trying, each day. Maybe, one day....
---
Hey late comment but after watching your videos I was inspired to try myself, I know I don't have bird bones so i wasn't expecting the world but it seems either the server was too laggy or there was a speedcap implemented. Have you been able to make any good flights after the survival patch?

---
Yeah most games with PvP have that system implemented. A necessity really.
---
Healing items are supposed to be a one time thing that cannot be spammed, thus it should rightfully be impossible to 'heal themselves' in an intense firefight.

Weapons and armor have 3 stars available, and each star has perks only available to that spot. Any specific mob damage, TS, Quad, Instigating, Bloodied, Furious share the first. Explosive and others share the second, and 10% aimed damage and movement perks, plus special modifiers are shared for the third slot.
---
My point flew over your head friend.
---
Cute how you used an opportunity to sling mud and curcumvented the point. 
---
I'm sure no one will disagree that the Atom shop items are shit. 
---
My point is, why present things that people (large scale) want.
---
And Not just B.S.  items people will buy  
---
(just because) they are there.
---
Of course people are wearing the items. 
---
There's nothing really there to choose from. 
---
And those items are likely paid for by completing challenges anyways. 
---
Hah! didnt even change the directories! wow..
---
Who knows. If there is it's not up front about it like other games.
---
Probably taken off to fix it since it was bugged and people weren’t getting the shotgun camo
---
Mid to late 2019 from what I remember
---
Yay! I'm top priority!
---
great idea.. but you know. Bethesda.
---
You gotta pay the troll toll... 
---
Bethesda's should throw you some merch to keep/give away at Pax.  
---
Ok, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
I'd say the penalty for death is my biggest qualm with it too.
---
If they left it the same as in Adventure (junk and caps), or even did what you said (a cap on caps and aid items on death), not only would it be more inviting, but it would make it easier to bring your character over if you're the type that runs with Traveling Pharmacy and, quite honestly, have nowhere to stash your 50 bloody Stimpacks.
---
I can account for over 2,5000 successful events, the majority 100% perfect (no robot Deaths) with my person events, the 5 - 15 players with me on each Event cycle and quite of a few people feeding me data.   
---
About 1/25 times (roughly) a 100% Successful event ended with Max Cap/XP Reward, a plan, but no mask, which should only ever occur if one or robot dies..    
---
A great deal of people saw the same thing occur, rarely, but enough to notice.  
---
At this point, pretty sure that was when we were supposed get the Uncommon or Rare masks, but something failed / erred preventing the assignment.

Yeah that's my bad I can barely read most of the time
---
Weapon hunting was the best part of the grind. After finding what I finally wanted after months of playing I almost don’t know what to do anymore 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Oh, we defo will, top priority my man. Top. Priority. 
---
/me shimmies away
---
Yeah, but it would be less immersive since the Pip-Boy 2000 lacked the capability to do so. Like I said; it's a videogame. From a role play perspective, your character cannot see the dots.
---
I logged in survival on my lvl 150.  I pre selected a location in adventure mode to log into survival mode to try to kill some legendary enemies off the beaten path. 
---
 Like everyone else I wanted the named weapon.
---
 I searched a few areas that I knew had some legendary enemies spawn in the past.  I couldn't find a single one.
---
 All the while I kept hearing this arcade type sound go off when somebody died and the names appeared on my screen when it happened. I'm definitely not a fan of that by any means.
---
I heard gunshots in the distance so I decided to walk a different way until I made my way to another location that I knew had legendary spawns. Nothing.
---
 At this point I'm 30 to 40 minutes into the server so I check my map and realize I was in 3rd place on the charts. Not wanting a forced PVP battle I logged off and haven't logged back in to survival again.
---
Not much of a story but that was my experience in survival so far. To me the legendary weapon reward isn't even worth playing on those servers.
---
 It was a very arcade type/ battle royale/ death match thing that I don't really want any part of.
---
My parents have a mouse with a scroll wheel that, when clicked, alternates between “clicking” like a normal wheel and then smoothly turning. Is yours like that by any chance? 
---
Wow, I've often wondered who the hell would camp in the desolation.
---
The rusty pick has a power armor spawn with a core,  about 6 explosive crates, 4-5 ammo crafts, a set mini gun spawn in the truck in the parking lot, and a set combat shotgun spawn,  across the street is a radio tower that has a generator with a core. AVR also has a core in the basement.
---
Down the road from there is a set random encounter spawn point,
---
There is also another power armor / core spawn on the hills near belching Betty.
---
having the same thing (random freeze that clears) on a Dual Xeon system....  
---
Many of the people I've seen reporting it seem to have higher than Average Thread count machines.
---
Yeah I do
---
I disagree.  Toilets and all chairs should put your player into an AFK mode.  I like your idea, too.
---
Yeah, I think the victor in a PvP battle should still receive double rewards, the loser should still lose caps at their level.
---
Spawn Points should be actually safe zones. Meaning that if you spawn in one of this places neither you will be able to fire weapons not will be attacked while In the safe zones. Excepction to this rule should be that if you're trying to run into the safe zone whole being attacked that it will not apply to you nor your attacker. But as soon as you respawn you're protected by this area.
---
Well, maybe, but that's beside the point. Because not every week is going to have such a meh reward. Also I'm not a big fan of achievements that are either nigh impossible or badly programmed or as is likely, both. Hard, yes. Rare, fine. But impossible? No thank you. See: Last week's rare Fasnacht masks that never actually dropped for anyone.
---
I too frequently quit games that I have thousands of hours into because they released a feature that I didn't even bother to try before judging.
---
The early parts of the game are littered with them, no doubt.  As you progress into different areas of the map, you will find that they dont have as many spawns in high level areas.  
---
Yeah, they frequent the area, but being underground with natural foundations means I'm relatively protected from them. 
---
Hopefully soon 
---
Would u choose a gauss rifle or a Gatling gun
---
Yes. You know why? Because the majority of players you see probably aren't carrying duped weapons, but that doesn't matter, cause people like you will assume they are, people a here are already assuming anyone using more than one stealth boy are people who duped 100s of them. 
---
Here's what will happen. They'll start fresh characters only. People like you will be happy for a week. 
---
Then you'll find all these players who grinded the fuck out of that week, who have excellent gear, who murdered people like you and one of two things will get posted here;
---
"There HAS to be a new duping method! It's ruining survival"
---
Or
---
"Survival is still Broken, thanks Bugthesda"
---
Hi all, 
---
Thanks for your reports about this. We're aware of an issue that can prevent the temporary invulnerability effect from being applied in some situations after Fast Traveling or Respawning in Survival mode. We're actively investigating this and looking into a fix for a future update. 
---
As a workaround, avoid fast traveling or respawning in locations where there have been lots of PVP-related player deaths (these areas will have multiple skull icons on the Map).
---
Gesh if you seen the other post then you'd understand. Take the the stick out of your ass buddy. I was trying to be funny it came off stupid I dont have the wittiest humor. 
---
Yeah I was told that in a previous post that this pipboy cant handle a map function. 
---
No! But I found an older mouse and it works wonderfully now! Haha gunna delete post
---
True, hitting a bong is not an indicator but...it was definitely impairing him. Maybe he wasn’t the smartest peanut in the turd before but it certainly didn’t help the situation. 
---
Haha you deserve a upvote!
---
I do understand man, I still get hot under the collar bring killed in the game, so I’m forcing myself to play low health and not carry too much loot but just die lots, it is helping and I’m becoming less worried.
---
You should not be laughed at really, not all players have a history of PVP, older players cut their teeth on text based games and may find modern fast paced PVP a bit stressful, I do but I’m trying to get better.
---
while thats true, as a high level, i mainly spend around 65% of my time in the lower-mid level areas cause they are arguable the most beautiful
---
Yeah this is pretty much annoying -.- everytime. Somtimes i  open the emote window, but actually wanted to open the fav wheel. 
---
&gt;Forced to participate in an extremely poorly thought out and executed pvp mode
---
I don't think you understand what the word "forced" means.   
---
On the other hand, if the devs ARE really Vault-Tec, you're doing a great job of proving out the idea that the player base is too stupid to know better. 
---
Or, just take PvP out of the game. If I wanted to play fortnight, I would play fortnight.
---
I use mine constantly. No issues. I use it to reach areas otherwise not possible
---
I’ve had this exact same idea actually. I have a freaking ton of 1* solid legendary weapons (Anti-armor, furious, Instigating, etc) that I’ll give to anyone that wants one. I’ll be on Xbox tonight around 930 EST, message the same as name, we can meet up, you request whatever and it’s yours :)
---
Actually, Todd just called me, says he’s seen this post and he’ll get it sorted. 
---
if i speak to someone they usually speak back. so plenty use their mic's
---
gatling..since u asked 
---
Yep that right, and this the other reason, and for every thing else there's Mastercard! Just priceless! 
---
Not all hero’s wear capes
---
 I too have noticed this.
---
Unfortunately (for us, I am sure the devs sighed in relief) the chap that did the community patch notes, due to personal reasons, has not been able to do so in the last couple of patches so is tricky to tell exactly what is going on but Super Duper seems to 'proc' less often since patch 7.
---
You post here and then I tell you I have a 1* lvl 50 bloodied grognaks axe for sale.
---
Who would want to play this game without legendaries? That'd be torture.
---
I'm interested 👀
---
Giggity! 
---
Sorry, there was plenty of good advice already so went with a “comedy”(depending on opinion) option. 
---
Yup, at least the resilience is over on the survivor server now, without advantages of slap damage and pacifist rules of engagement.
---
I guarantee you that if the slap damage change wasn't made, they would still be on the adventure server challenging workshops and "tricking" unsuspecting players into PvP.
---
Dude I know how to do it but there are lots of other players that does not. Maybe you want this game to be exclusive for players with cheese builds but then you should not expect it to survive. Unless the game has a stable playerbase it will die. The game will not have a stable playerbase if players feel that the game is unbalanced, then they will leave to go play one of many simular games. Stop being a smart ass and realise that the game needs to be fair. 
---
Holy crap, the detail!  It must have taken forever to get those paint gradients for the rusting effect just right.  Well done, sir!
---
Name checks out.....
---
Oh sorry I read that as VauotCunter98. Nevermind.
---
Was a fan of Oxhorn until his homophobic blog resurfaced. Lost all respect for that dude.
---
So, question. I’ve been looking for a danger lizard. When I was low level (20-30) I was following one of my friends around and got mauled by one at the spawn point for Watoga, but haven’t seen one there since then. I’m just wondering where you got yours at so I can try my luck somewhere else. 
---
r/Market76
---
r/fo76bazaar 
---
My camp isnt far from a spawn point jus so I can get in the action from safety lol
---
Did they implement something similar for workshop owners on the adventure server to curb the griefing?
---
You did read that joining the survival server opens you up to full PvP, right?
---
I haven't found myself getting attacked very often, if that helps. I've run into mongrel dogs outside a couple of times, and scorchbeasts have flown over  (but couldn't do anything to me because I was underground). Last night I had four glowing gulpers pay a visit, but they were too big to get through my  doorless entrance. 
---
 Nice thank you, that's awesome. I have sent it to the person that was asking me. Could you not open the first block as the front door or is it too high up ? Nicely done.
---
Players intentionally choosing to make poor decisions is not poor game design, it's stupid players. If you know somewhere is being camped, and you continually go there and die, that's your own choice and your own fault.  
---
Sorry laser pistol is gone
---
Ya but high lvl people camp the station and two shot explosive jerks farm the resort and golf club, but idk about inside because I haven't been able to get that far
---
That looks super cozy and snug.  There aren't enough tunnel/cavern builds, and you pulled that one off well.
---
I've been out of the game for a bit, did we collect more info on whether or not legendary effects are truly random?
---
Oh, wow.  Thanks for the feedback, yall.  Still seems a it ridiculous, everything considered. 
---
Used to be a fan of Oxhorn till his homophobic blog post resurfaced. Not cool. I get he's a Christian but I do not agree with his views on that topic. 
---
Pretty much that. 
---
Ya, people are the only problem, I wish I could store my caps so I could go in their easily and not care about dying 
---
So I have to walk around and tell people that then? I have 11 charisma in a team. Quite a few perks that would be beneficial to share as well. The problem is actually getting people to get into a team.  
---
For the record this does not look like an oversight.
---
There is a keyword aplty named 'BlockSuperDuperPerk' (Form ID 0043C439) that has to be added, which is a deliberate action as opposed to forgetting to remove something that is part of the record by default, which could be an oversight.
---
Basically the devs by design wanted to exclude Super Duper when it comes to crafting booze.
---
Okay, so, I have a TSE double barrel. Let’s just say that, as you wish, explosive becomes its own primary. What happens to my shotgun? Does it only fire one extra pellet? Does it only explode? Does it get split in half, one being TS and the other explosive? Or do I get to keep it, and it becomes a legacy item? 
---
It exits the game. Fastest way to avoid anything you don't want happening.
---
&gt;I understand balance, but I don't think they do
---
You obviously haven't played the game in months then, because you clearly don't have a clue what you're talking about.
---
I've got one that's in my bedroom.  I just pretend my bed has a really fancy canopy.
---
It's not just the location but it needs to be a place we can fast travel to without worrying it will get nuked and needs to have things like workbenches and stash boxes.  It should also be enemy free so there is nothing that can disrupt trade.  That's what the game is missing right now.
---
Yeah this new mode really brings out the toxicity in people. Also, I have had the same problem with my lever action rifle where point blank shots so zero damage at all, it’s quite frustrating
---
WTB "Eat that ass like groceries" emote!
---
Yes, killed a scorch beast with level 40 serrated combat knife yesterday.
---
Pretty sure its called advanced connectors, could be wrong.
---
No, your point is crystal clear.  You believe people will spend Atoms on stuff they don't like because why?  
---
You are entitled to your opinion.  I am entitled to mine.  You state NO ONE likes the stuff in the Atom Shop.  I see it in the wild.  Who has more evidence to back their opinion?
---
And breaking the lore so we can have your "cool" items will bring more anger down on this game.  There are already people who flip out about how the Supermutants shouldn't be in this game.
---
I've noticed op players and reg players like me, level 30s n 40s took me down and I'm level 79.. some ppl jus have too many serums and mutations to fuck with. It's not easy but if you get a jump on someone you have a good chance at dropping em!! You are right tho some players jus wreck all in their path and it's been me more than once.  However I have really enjoyed the new game mode and all its changes even tho I'm not king shit I'm havin a blast!!!!
---
'which are the ones that talk about periods again?' literally most of them, can't credit just one comedian with talking about red wings on comedy central in 2007 yanno?!
---
My house has been right next to /above this since the game came out pretty much. I have a garage door that’s right on the road and a house built with a little watch out post on the road. I like to think of it as my safehoise for people traveling from the northern part of cranberry to the southern part 
---
It can take some time and patience, but once you get the hang of it and with a little finesse, it's not too hard.
---
&gt; if you seen the other post
---
If I HAVE to have seen the other post to get it, then it's unfair to expect me to get it.
---
I mean you went up against someone who was probably completely optimized for PvP. Are you optimized for PvP? Have you min/maxed your character? This is present in every rpg to ever exist, and its hard to balance rewarding time spent developing your character and keeping a level playing field.
---
I agree with you. I was very disheartened to see the crap Version of survival that they threw our way.  That is why I made the post that I made. I want a real survival mode.
---
I love adventure mode but I do want to play a more survival feeling version as well.
---
 Ive said this over and over in this post but the arcade style/ battle royale/ deathmatch thing that they gave us us is just plain awful.  There is nothing "survival" about it.  I feel like I should be inserting a quarter and pressing start to play it.
---
 I do also believe this was an attempt to get a customer base that they didn't have and wanted.  Don't go too far maybe they will come to their senses and turn this thing around for the good.
---
Shotgun / melee build. I use an explosive shotgun and an AA Grognak's Axe. I don't need stealth.  The best alternative is Bloodied, but it has issues w the needed low health. 
---
Or, y'all were actually blowing shit out of proportion and most of the trolls got bored and moved on to other games, leaving the rest of us to actually enjoy the game.  Quit pretending that you speak for everyone who "bought the game at or near release." 
---
Since you mentioned new atom shop possibilities of course Bethesda will add this 
---
At the endbond the day, most adults are really, large toddlers.
---
I killed several players with non legendary handmade. It wasnt best option but they died, more than once. Be sneaky and if you have it chameleon armor is what keeps me safe right now.. 
---
Why they just stand there and let you melee them to oblivion is pretty funny. I almost feel sorry for their furry batty faces ☹️
---
I needz it though because I dont know all the locations :(
---
You and I are friends online and we teamed up last night after you ambushed me only for you to exit the game a minute later.
---
I agree to an extent, but everyone goes crazy with a lvl 60 beating a lvl 300.  leveling past 50 doesn’t mean anything if planned properly from the start.
---
as long as you have good legendaries and right perk load-out your lvl just becomes a number after 50 it’s irrelevant imo
---
And yet you're still here.... 
---
I've noticed it also.  I'm carrying a lot more canned and non-perishable goods on me because of how fast things spoil and how fast hunger and thirst seem to deplete now.  I don't really have a reason to make any prepared food now.
---
At _least_ 450 caps.
---
You can probably charge a lot more, but you want to sell it cheaper than the robot vendors, otherwise nobody will buy it from you.
---
Well that's what adventure mode is for, I want a true survival mode.
---
I would play on both modes.
---
It would be nice to have some faction system with commitment. Currently you can just follow the quest lines and be an "honorary" member of all the factions. You get all their uniforms/plans and access to their base. We have plenty of character slots, we have coop mechanics, we have player trading...there's really no reason why we can't have some faction-specific gear. Wouldn't it be nice if enclave members could craft the enclave plasma rifle? Or if BoS members could apply BoS paint to all their weapons? 
---
At the end of the day, most adults are just really large toddlers.
---
I dont fuck with anyone under level 40, if I see a level 5 Ima leave em alone. I did bring my character over tho as many others did too.
---
True
---
just don't go throwing around your logically sound lore and popping my radiation filled balloon. Lol
---
See, This is when you build Trap Bases!
---
The first block is harder to place back, the top ones snap back to position
---
My only worry is that people will try to farm caps that way. Get a high level friend, kill him &amp; profit. If both amounts of caps (win and lose) are equal would be a bit harder to exploit it. 
---
There was literally a conspiracy to drive down the metacritic scores at launch. There was an organized campaign to copypasta a template "review" that was just a hostile screed shitting on the game.
---
Your way to underleveled. Next time there might not be people to carry you. I would get at least level 60 before going in! Hope this doesn’t come off as rude though.
---
That’s a great point. 
---
Where do these brown paper bags even come from? Do survivors of the wasteland have a steady supply of brand-spanking new paper lunchbags?
---
Yeah, except I notice most players don’t get the perfect armor, perks, and weapons for themselves until around 80-100
---
For me being a raider is looting people’s unlocked purifiers when they’re not around 👻
---
Could do a real basic one, copy paste the above list with numbers instead of dotpoints. Could simplify it to just The quest/event name with a number without the info, then paste it onto a map image and insert numbers on the map at the respective locations.
---
I'd love to be able to get rid of the wheel altogether and switch scroll to zoom in/out like how it was in previous games.
---
Yep, Ive got a lot of room above ground to work with, so that's the plan! There's also a semi-trailer with the back door open in my build area, so I've set up a cute little seating area inside that you can only see if you go in. 
---
I skipped it for ages, just because I ended up in the Toxic Valley first.  Other than the Overseer's quest, there's not a lot of mainline stuff that sends you in that direction.  I hadn't explored it properly for ages, and I think it's sadly underutilized.
---
I like the idea of it but it would be better if there was one for adventure mode also.  Maybe not as powerful as the ones in survival mode but still reasonably powerful so those of us who don't want to deal with pvp can get some cool items also without having to rely on the RNG gods for a specific legendary effect combination.
---
I can tell there had been some changes, and we prob will see more changes. But as it was on survival day one was actually fairly balanced as far as damage goes. I was killin players with non legendary stuff more than once. It was awesome!! What do you feel needs to be addressed or changed??
---
Robot vendors want thousands of caps, but people seem to sell these for only a little. I've found 2 in the wasteland, inside containers.. maybe that's why they are cheap?
---
I changed my key for jumping to x (on PS4) so I don’t have this issue, maybe change the bindings?
---
Question:  Are we supposed to not be able to see the brown bags very clearly as a game design choice?  Like so we have a penalty for death or something?
---
Just FYI sometimes it looks like there's a lot of folks hanging out underneath White PowDer Winter Sports (or just south of it) but it's just a glitch as that's the 0,0 center of the map and the game's just being 'weird'.
---
Okay, time to bring another game into the story: Team Fortress 2. Yeah, that’s right, the hat simulator. See, the thing is, if people want something, they will get that thing. I have a cowboy hat that’s on fire. I have a bald eagle head, with two more eagles sitting on the same soldier. In the wasteland, 25 years after World War III, I’m wearing a tuxedo. 
---
No, before you go on and say that my response is “cute”, think about this: Fallout has a lot of players. Not every player is going to want the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as their power armor. Not every player is gonna want a pink princess castle as their bed, either. This is a game where I can go around in overalls, a hard hard, and welding goggles swinging a pipe wrench while reciting Meet the Engineer, and somebody else can throw in overalls with a sack hood and chase people with a chainsaw. So just because **you** want “realistic, true OG Fallout” stuff, maybe others want silly stuff. 
---
Beyond that, wanting things like NCR armour in the game? You do realise that this game takes place *before* the original Fallout, right? The NCR doesn’t exist yet. It isn’t even close to beginning to exist. 
---
Now go on, call me a child or say that I read your post completely wrong. But to me, it sounds like you’re complaining that Bethesda isn’t catering specifically to you. 
---
There was an issue with the gauss rifle that it missed the first vats shot every time but that was supposed to be corrected in the last patch. They have accidentally walked stuff back with different updates so I guess it’s possible. 
---
I noticed 2\* and 3\* enemies dropping more 2\* and 3\* loot in the last couple days, one session, killed 6-7 3\* enemies and I got 5 3\* pieces of gear form them all and 2 1\* items.
---
Or it was just pure luck/RNG....they all ended up getting vendored, except 1 piece of armour that had 20% weapon reduction...
---
Well, they reduce slap damage to zero so people have to actually shoot back for them to do anything now. And hopefully camps will be protected soon so all you have to do is ignore them.
---
Exiting build mode seems to fix it for me before it randomly pops up again
---
Google
---
Did you just keep spawning/fast travelling to terminals? I found it fairly easy to avoid pvp if I kept to myself. 
---
I'm not home to look at the exact size but yeah you have a few more to go.
---
I have the plans, so I can craft you some. I'll be online in 1-2 hrs. Just 200 caps if you have the mats. GT: Fuzzygrundel.
---
I’m not completely min/maxed or anything and I understood that there were going to be a lot of people who were going to be perfectly optimized for PVP (which is why I wanted new characters), but I was getting one shouted in full X-01 PA before I could even move. And I’m not talking about doing tiny amounts of damage to a player with a full set of PA and me overreacting and saying that my shots did nothing. They had no PA, and my shots did no damage. I checked multiple times and shot them multiple times. No change at all.
---
To get into this boys hole
---
Couldnt agree more, fuck it was fun tho!
---
Will u be on tomorrow I won’t be on then 
---
Also, wrong sub-reddit. Haha. 
---
Beth didn't expected that their little sandbox game mutated to a normal mmo, because people just dont it better. So they will and need to implement this piece by piece, otherwise everyone is going to player real mmos like so called Eve Online 
---
HAHA now I remember, we had a fun battle. Yeah it was super late, I teamed up with you to pass the 12 workshops over to you before I logged off LOL 12 workshops!!! Anyhow feel free to team up with me anytime. 
---
I really respect both of these answers. Would love top be able to do mail quests for strangers and see other players camps, stuffing those mailboxes full
---
It honestly wouldn't surprise me if they made 2\* and 3\* enemies more likely to drop 2\* and 3\* loot but then balanced it out by making 2\* and 3\* enemies more rare. There seems to be a lot of anecdotal evidence that this is the case.
---
Why can't the dropped items just be the dropped items?
---
Well yeah a non PA player can have much higher defenses than a PA wearing player with the appropriate affixes on their armor. If you dont have stagger perks, fireproof, and the capability to vats crit headshot, it will be very difficult for you to damage them. With assassin/sentinel armor they are pretty much immune to damage unless you stagger/headshot vat crit.
---
Well as soon as I post this I was proven wrong today. Tried to do survival beta and cleaned out west tek with no legionaries and the fusion core was out back. 
---
The road from fort defiance to watoga has a horse trailer with giddyup butter ups in it. I get 11 screws each run then hit sugar cove as others have said!!
---
I was going by the PVP I had experienced over workshops in adventure mode weeks ago,  but it already looks like things have been changed since then. You seem to think it's fine as it is, and maybe that's true. If so, that's great.  
---
I just know that  Adventure mode has changed quite a bit since the beta. 
---
I was concerned about making a PVP specialized build for survival, because I was concerned  
---
I’m interested. Will bring my own mats. Friend request sent. I’m IGN jims1973
---
Haha thanks for the chuckle. 
---
I get this sometimes when I try to put away my Power Armor and need to enter it and exit to reset whatever was bugged out.
---
See it from the otherside, while all high lvl players lose crazy amounts of caps. Every newbie and dude with no caps literally getting a -50% pvp dmg debuff if you dont have anymore caps to spend and are below zero. As long you dont pay that off and not getting killed over and over you are captured in this hellhole of basically - caps 
---
I like jumping over there for short bursts on my lvl 45ish sniper. Even before I switched to my end game weapons, my self crafted lever action could do some decent damage in the new mechanics. I was even top 3 for a bit. It's a nice change of pace from adventuring..... On that note though, it should definitely be called Vault 76 Entrance Deathmatch though. 
---
I would also enjoy a totally separate Survival mode where everybody starts from scratch.
---
Wait what's so bad about instigating with limb damage?  Seems tempting to me.
---
Yep advanced power connectors. You can get them in watoga and harpers ferry I believe 
---
Yeah I use a lever action rifle and it doesn’t hit at all, I’ve even noticed some crits not hitting either
---
yeah and it also includes different switches, conduits and tripwires as well.
---
If you're on PC, then the first patch is the biggie, the following patches were nowhere near as big. Consoles are another beastie, as each following patch was around 4-6 gig. The PS4 users were having a issues with the game reserving a huge amount of storage while updating I think.
---
While I agree with this, someone on another post pointed out the flaw with locked characters. 
---
If we all started new survival characters, we would be on the same page, and in a few months say everyone hits level 100 with a decent load out and maybe a few legendaries.
---
Now new players coming to the world would not survive at all and it would be impossible for them to even play survival, simply because of the level gap
---
The more i level up the more i'm afraid i'll get killed. I don't think it's a good thing. 
---
As for aid items, i really do believe that we should have a set percentage of items we can lose everyone will be happier. For example if everyone knows that on death they can lose 25% of their stimpacks people might think twice on how many stimpacks they'll bring with them.
---
At the same time it ensures that you will never lose all of your stimpacks. 
---
For example if you bring 50 stimpacks, on your first death 25% loss means 13 stimpacks. You're left with 37.
---
On your second death you only lose 9. Third will go down to 7 simpacks lost. Maybe it's not perfect but i do think it's better than the current system.
---
It will be impossible to lose everything.
---
Ro I’m so sorry about what happened last night, how was I supposed to know 3 level 200s would show up after us RIP. I got more stimpaks off them if you need some more. (my reddit name is not the same as my gamertag btw)
---
Survival is fine as is. Go back to adventure or deal with the consequences. Not tryin to be mean but we all knew what we could lose here
---
We need to be funding this. 
---
Indeed though with my suggestion fast travel points would still be PvP hotbeds.  Just wouldn't be spawn camping hotbeds. :P
---
Unless it’s a 2nd character...
---
I had the same problem. I stood by the monolith looking headstone
---
Plus at one point (with the same black powder rifle) I was able to deal damage to them.
---
I have Metro Ex. Kinda interesting. I gave it a try during the patch last week. FO76 is the only game I am aware of where a patch is a multi hour, multi GB ordeal. So, yeah, I had time for Metro Exodus while waiting for the most recent "load".
---
The graphics are nice, especially for a game that didn't consume 40Gb of my console disk space. Also, the game engine seems... responsive.
---
I'll continue to allocate more time to Metro and Anthem (anthem engine and graphics also nice) during time FO76 is dropping its multi GB update deuce 
---
Then it's pretty weird from those players to admit entering the dev room when I ask them about it.
---
Try not killing it with one shot...
---
Probably tweeks the game running the explosion animation, the sudden drop in all hp plus the loot lotto wheel
---
Yeah, they're uncommon but not super rare. I've gotten them twice in the same play session from workshop defenses.
---
Yeah they were probably moving. The way sentinel works is you get something dumb like +15% damage resistance while standing per armor piece.
---
Yep jus start the unfairness now and get it over with
---
Your mom on the corner
---
So what exactly are you saying? Because I see no substance to your counter argument there.  Are you saying nuking is still as active as pre-nerfing by Bethesda?  Because on Xbox 1 it is 1/10 if not lower now.   Like I actually said in my post you could joing literally any server and there would be someone nuking within 30 minutes, many times less.  Pre-nerfing, do nuke zone, server hop, 90% chance another nuke would be launched by someone very soon. That is NOT the case anymore, at least on Xbox 1.

Psychostat recipe missing at medical bay. 
---
There are a few caves and tunnels sprinkled throughout the map, but I'm not at home so can't really send you a screenshot of the map right now. I'm sure there are some YouTube videos out there that explore these types of locations if that helps. 
---
oh, so just never go to a location in a game, if a location in a game is a no go zone then it is a result of poor game design, quit trolling spawn camper...
---
Kinda wish player damaged was lowered so that fights were more prolonged.  Would feel much more fun.
---
I've encountered a few people I haven't been able to hurt much, but for the most part my lvl 45 alt that is a vats crit sniper build seems to hold up nicely to higher levels. AA and Armor Penetration work wonders..... Those poor clunky PA guys will learn eventually
---
I have no complaints even tho I lost over 1000 caps n 40lbs of aid.. 
---
I kind of feel like survival should of imitated Fallout 4's survival mode. No fast traveling at all, unrestricted PVP, all weapons take 2-3 hits to kill both AI/Users, while AI can kill in 2-3 hits, all depending on level. Such as, if you are level 10, going up against a level 50-80 AI, you will do significantly less damage, but if you are close on level brackets, the damage will be much more, to prevent easy farming by lower level players. This will be unchanged across all levels with users though, and only DR perks will effect the 2-3 kill shots. Sounds good on paper, don't know about the appliance of it. I really appreciated FO4's survival mode.
---
Passive mode does carry over. I made a new character for survival and was wondering why I couldn't defend myself. It eventually gave me the notification that I was in passive...on survival mode...
---
I'm using a handmade non legendary, sometimes I win 
---
Greetings, fellow bridge troll. 
---
You can after the event ends though right?
---
You did 100% the right thing. I love finding players that play like me. Such as helping and protecting lower level players. I'm not even over level 100 yet but it's enough to assist. Just wish I was better at pvp for when those toxic players turn up and harass everyone.
---
We need a “I have a gift for you” emote.
---
Scripted, like the PvE mobs always spawning in the same locations, daily quests and events, materials spawning in same location...you mean scripted like that?
---
Randomly got 3. Like 2 in a row at whitespring. 
---
Is the 50% debuff still applicable on survival? I think i've seen people saying it's only a thing on adventure mode. I didn't test it myself... But yeah, i agree, being a newbie on survival really sucks at the moment... 
---
I dunno... I've dabbled a bit on my lvl 45 alt and come out a few thousand caps up each time...... Helps everybody else is a high lvl so I get bigger rewards
---
you mean deathmatch mode, or battle royale mode, or call of duty mode. Keep a real survival mode far far away from removing key features of the game.
---
Oh yeah it's carnage 😂
---
Yeah after 7pm central. 
---
Wait what time zone u in
---
It's especially a pain in the ass in Watoga when all the Protectrons get that "*spawn and suddenly die for no reason*" pattern that happens there a lot.  They just insta-explode out of their little generators and you get caught in it.
---
Central
---
?? Most weed smokers are the opposite of that though.  
---
Is this Clint Bell?
---
I got a lvl5  1\* Anti-Armour Pipe-Pistol off of a Legendary radroach yesterday, looked on the map, found the lowest level dude, fast traveled to him and dropped it for him. 
---
Rendering. Just like the canvas bag situation. Cost of resources
---
You can mode your game right now. (PC only).
---
I noticed it happening only if i'm rushing the shot, regardless of game mode.
---
Waiting half a second after triggering vats usually works. 
---
Shit that’s like 2 in the morning for me,in that case I won’t be on till the weekend then
---
Best thing I’ve seen all day. Count agree more
---
I made thousands in the short bit I've been over there... It's a nice supplement after my vendor rounds over in adventure.  I like it.
---
Should add a small USB fan on the end with streamers that mimic the fire.
---
Didnt look at all your data, but to post it on another 'my legendary dont count' post.
---
Only counts the ones with stars.
---
What's to stress about? (besides Scorchbeasts and Ghouls :D) it s a game...relax and wander around with pacifist mode you will never have any issues (random server drops aside). Honestly and i run SOLO level 70 and never had any problems even before this latest update but if someone started shit i would just change servers now you don't even have to do that. 
---
You know CAMPs can be built underground right? The dev room isn't accessible to us anymore. That is all.
---
Man that would be nice and make total sense.
---
Only starred legendaries will count... Really annoying i know...
---
If someone could find Smarty all will be revealed I believe.
---
Why are there left hand scanners on the right side of the door at white springs bunker ?
---
Well if he can't or don't I can do the same for you 
---
It's weird that in the span of 20 minutes I have recorded at least 15 guys there, in the place where the dev room *is*.
---
Huh, I guess it is a popular spot to "build underground CAMPS"!
---
That is all, thanks for your participation.
---
For how much?
---
Counter idea:
---
You don't spawn where the campers will obviously be, and play.
---
Starting to wonder if this is a bug, kept happening to me with ghouls in whitesprings today. Thought it might be me one shotting them too. Swapped to a non explosive gun and it kept happening. Some of them finally reappered to loot but it took several minutes 
---
Thanks, pal! I appreciate it!
---
Hi I don’t know if you see this but where was this? I like möth and I want to see him
---
It's broken for sure..
---
The only time I was tagged was because I had a workshop, I was in Whitespring's vendor area and basically just got blown up, heard a boom right beside me and exited the trade in time to die. This is still a solid way for them to take you out.    
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
I no longer hold workshops but have noticed a lot more owned in adventure mode already, leaving those players open to attack.
---
I just miss being able to drop/pick up objects. There are plenty of cool junk items that would be great to add as decoration, but you can't even place them down.
---
I'll help
---
If you want to attach a wire from A to B and if you start on point A but you jump instead of attaching it, try starting on point B. It's how i fixed the issue for myself.
---
Who? Never heard of the name.
---
My gamertag is PortCTBelle
---
I always find I have missiles or something I picked up that weigh a ton. I drop all ammo I won’t be using. 
---
A legendary drop if ever I saw one.
---
I've been trying to puzzle out if sneak mechanics in PVP are actually more than "person is sneaking/person is not sneaking." Does how good your character should be at sneaking on paper even matter? High agility and sneak perks do nothing more than a person with 1 AGI who is crouching? As far as I can tell, there is no reason to have stats to make you better at sneaking in a PVP context. I don't know if somebody hast tested these mechanics. Just thoughts I run into when trying to make a new survival mode only build.
---
You know what guy? 
---
Youre right, you're """entitled"""  to your opinion. 
---
And you are also right in the fact that ""some"" people buy the content. 
---
""Cool stuff"" is a subjective statement and not limited to what I mentioned purely by example.  
---
This DOES NOT mean mean its good content.
---
Neither does it mean people that purchase the content are satisfied with it. 
---
The content is ""something to do"", or ""something new""
---
But hardly anything people ""buy and large"" care about. 
---
The items in the Atom shop is shit. 
---
Bottom line,  And im very positive majority of people agree with that. 
---
And i seriously doubt anythi g other than young kids, or people who have accumulated a large sum of Atoms from challenges are buying the stuff. 
---
But as far as real money?
---
Naw, they can do so much better. 
---
however, as stated id like to open constructive dialogue with one of the developers as to what leads to content choices in the Atom shop. 
---
What's coming down the pipe, whats the process, are we (the players are any source of inspiration, and ultimately,  what are the plans, (if any) for the future. 
---
Do you have the answers to,any of these questions? 
---
Oh, darn. I have my camp just north and would farm a few ghouls before going elsewhere.
---
I did notice a dropoff in ghoul activity.
---
Run the wire to a switch before the garage
---
I was thinkjng that in the future. The piece kn the back is remkvable so I can prkbably make a future upgrade where it'd work!
---
The patches mostly replace data rather than adding it. The total size of my Fallout76 folder on PC is 55GB.
---
Connect power to the switch, then from the switch to the door. 
---
I was expecting a real post-apocalypse survivor experience by fearing dying in the hands of another player, but got a free-for-all experience instead.  
---
Fallout 76 isn't about leader boards and deathmatch, it is about role playing a character in a online Fallout world with unexpected interactions (hostile or not) from other characters.
---
I was getting that too, they were dropping dead before I could even put my cross hairs on them to see if they were regular or extra crispy.
---
omg,really?  lol, I didnt think to track that .    
---
So thats why!
---
Thanks ya'll
---
What about explosive weapons? That's is super unfair...
---
Try underneath the road bridge near Treetops and Big B's Rest Stop. It has two random encounter spots close to each other, giving you higher odds of getting a random encounter that is a single tameable animal (a Dealthclaw can spawn in these spots). 
---
If you don't get what you want, server hop and keep trying until you do. It may take some time. I got my pet Mirelurk King with this way. 
---
It happens all the time.
---
If they have a red outline glow to their body, just hop servers.  They are about to just drop dead for no reason.
---
I'll help out too
---
They're fairly common workshop drops, but if someone doesn't take workshops or run lockpick then they'll probably be willing to pay \~1k for the plan. Someone offered me 2.5k for one once, as an extreme example.
---
Good. Vats is dumb. Especially for pvp
---
Now if we could just get character names displayed....
---
A majority of the player base doesn't have to have duped weapons for it to be a problem. Just getting killed once by one is all it takes to make it an issue.
---
its fun..i only did it a handful of times..but it definitely has a pretty epic feel to it..what did she drop for you..did you get decontamination shower plans and all the stable flux?
---
Once, long ago went to Vegas. Lost $300 at blackjack in 3 hands. Haven't played blackjack there since. I still enjoy slots, food, drinks, concerts....but damn, still remember that one bad experience. I don't blame others or the casino,etc.
---
Yeah but it really sucks when your rifleman build revolves around VATS while others can spray you down with their TSE auto handmade
---
Aaaaaaaaah, thanks!
---
levels mean nothing after 50 i dont understand why people are complaining about level disparity,,,
---
over 500 hours explored and i only have a full set of one star weightless, my only full set of anything. the dupers screwed up the intended pvp situation  that Bethesda set out to create. many people will disagree but i truly want to start fresh with a guarantee from Bethesda that duping is eliminated at least from survival mode. 
---
Well yes, but actually no. There is a cycling light in the game that allows you to cycle through different colours. It's in the same category as the ceiling lights when building, and comes either before or after the strobe light IIRC.
---
The glowing fungus and lit posters do help with the mood lighting though. 
---
The power needs to go to the switch. And then from the switch to the garage. U might just have it wired weird
---
Except farmed gear acquired in those extra 150 levels.
---
I'm still waiting. The other person hasn't shown up yet
---
Awesome! Thanks for letting me know, neighbour!
---
I think it could be a little more narrow, maybe in intervals of 10. Fresh out of the vault to 10, 11-20, etc 
---
Pneumatic Chest mod 
---
True. Tse is more dumb. Mostly vats should have just stayed in fo4 and not made the jump into 76.
---
There's a chest mod that prevents staggering but people stick with dense
---
I get that, it would be fun. There needs to be more interactive ‘bots since there’s no NPC. We can only kill scorched so long before we want to hear a friendly (ish) voice! 
---
Like close the game completely or just leave the server? That's very helpful thank you! I'm gonna try running a silo tonight (not sure if it will let me or not) so I'll definitely team up first.as far as Enemy spawn and flora is whitesprings better or fissure prime?
---
I got the shower and some stable flux. Also an assortment of random armor plans with a legendary pool cue.
---
Ok how about this. Provide literally any proof that you dev room still exists. A bunch of dudes underground isn't, that's more likely a camp and discord people
---
What's that?
---
I've never seen cave crickets near my C.A.M.P. And if by "mutie" you mean Super Mutants, I also haven't seen any of them nearby. 
---
i was really hoping you would have to start a new character, so at least everyone would be pvping at low levels but im level 15 getting killed by level 131s
---
I have enough time to help with dropping the nuke, OR if you’re dropping it on prime - to help with that instead. 🙂 GT: Cizin. Message first so I know who’s inviting me and for what.
---
If anything, it is taking that type of player you described away from the adventure server. Many who would either exploit workshops for PvP or take advantage of any exploit that gets discovered in the future that allows forced PvP in adventure.
---
That’s awesome what chemicals were used 
---
Does it fully prevent it?
---
The proof has already been sent to Bethesda's Support. About 5 videos of it. 
---
No, I actually agree with you, but as I stated above numerous times, the examples i gave were just that. 
---
Examples, and not to be taken litterily. 
---
And yes, you're right, Some people are happy with silly B.S.
---
But Are you saying that those people are the ones driving the decision making process?
---
Because its all rather wacky. 
---
Fallout 4 for example pumped out plenty of great stuff once modders started getting their hand in the pot. 
---
With Fallout 76 be the same?
---
This is the kind of player I've been worried about. PVP loser coming to wreak his/her sociopathic stupidity in PVE.  
---
Haha. So you cant actually provide any. Nice witch hunt
---
 furthermore, why is it in the game at all? It's dumb.
---
Maybe me when I have more free time? Message me in like ten days 
---
Hey, whatever makes you feel better!
---
Modification for Chest armor 
---
More Dense mod is better
---
I agree. The vendors are fun, but apart from Rose, Stratford, Chad, the Grafton Vendor, Grafton's Mayor and a few others, most robots have boring personalities. A lot of the fun robots are only in one quest (Miss Annie)  or random encounters.
---
Why is dense better?
---
I feel like its probably a memory or formatting issue. 
---
But they could limit it right? You can only have 5 lunchboxes active at a time or something.
---
Just imagine, if a troll wanted to crash a server he could walk in a line droppong a bunch of useless items in a bag in a box over and over.
---
Would he an awesome feature but it seems impossible to properly implement.
---
Nope, an army is mining all of the loot locations to sell items for cash on the web 
---
have no idea. without dense, you don't stagger. you die
---
How about "do 50% damage when using VATS" or something as a permanent debuff in Survival mode.
---
Themed servers.....melee only...chainsaw only.... Energy only..... Everything naked, maybe just masks
---
Hmmm. Why would you die without dense? 
---
Close the game completely. Don’t quit or leave world, just hard quit. It’ll still recognize you’re on a team. There are more enemies (which are also tougher) at the fissure but there’s so many it always makes my game lag lol. I usually only look for flora in Whitesprings bc I get the masses and fluids as well. 
---
niceee..i never got a legendary weapon from her
---
We'll get a 4Gb load out within a week to fix that.
---
It keeps saying I declined it but I didn't even receive an invite
---
Not worried at all about those.
---
With the correct build every weapon has the power to kill someone in 1-2 shots. If it's unfair for people to use explosive weapons then it should also be unfair to use anti-armor, instigating, bloodied, etc.
---
I used a 1* instigating hunting rifle with a 50 cal receiver for the few bits of PvP i did. Yeah it's reloading slowly but 2 shots is all i needed, and it doesn't matter what gun my target had. There wasn't enough time for him to figure out where i was shooting from then return fire.
---
Too many people are treating this new survival mode as if it was some battle royale kind of game. Yeah, weapon types would be an issue if that was the game mode, but survival is way closer to Arma 2 Dayz mod/epoch than anything else. 
---
Large map, not that many players on a map, lots of stalking, creeping around, very quick fights. It's not a PvP focused mode. It's a survival focused mode. Huge difference.
---
Well it wont be till there are private servers at least cause would be hard to have mods on a public server
---
cause explosives hurt a lot
---
But fireproof 3...
---
Could we get a faction for the cult of the mothman?
---
Bonuses: More Hp, Ap, Ap regen, and Hp regen during the night. 15% damage bonus with melee and energy weapons during the night. Wise moth man will show up from time to time to give you free ammo and water. 
---
I think I got like 8 or 9 one* bloodied in two hours today. Dumped them all at enclave vendor. 
---
VATS is an integral part of Fallout and removing it would be extremely lore-breaking.
---
You can buy the plans at Grafton and the Ash Heap vendors.
---
So, I logged back in, I actually have just been running overweight since yesterday and havn't sold any weapons or armor yet, was waiting to log back into Adventure mode, and yup, I had 4 weapons that all had the extra modifier ( the Major Modifier )   
---
UGH
---
It wouldn't be like the current survival because you wouldn't see anybody on the map.  I'm sure there will be people hunting other people but it will be much more difficult to do so not knowing where everybody is.
---
 The bounty system would definitely need an overhaul as well as there is hardly any punishment for killing other players.  If you still want to play as a raider you have to take the consequences that come with it which is a stiff bounty. 
---
 The point of this game is to rebuild the world not kill everybody over and over.
---
That was my whole idea behind a survival based adventure mode. Leave the hardcore PVP'ers on the death mode that they just built.
---
Yeah funny thing was I had went and created a support ticket with them and after a couple responses back and forth I start up the game, and had no issue after that haha
---
Sorry all that is happening to you man. If some people don't have anything nice to say, then they shouldn't bother repeating themselves at all.
---
Not interested. And schoolyard taunts stopped working on me a long time ago. 
---
Omg cat in my base is going to be a 100 percent thing now!
---
No argument from me, but i expected this to be the skilled players mode. Lotta bad mistakes overall man. Laser weapons being like FO3s BB gun is my personal favorite
---
I've tried, but it didnt really work, and where it did sort of work out, it made walking around near impossible. I gave up on conservative walls and floors, and got creative instead. I've made walls and divided "rooms" by stacking shelves on top of one another. As for the floor, there was already some wood laid around the main entrance and middle section, so I just threw my bear rug and a couple of daisy rugs down, and went about my day. 
---
Then go with pneumatic and tell us how it went. Last time I checked, fireproof without dense wasn't that good
---
Yep. 
---
If you have all the stuff then I'll do them for 250
---
Full size ones of course. 
---
Well relieved +1 charisma for next 60min
---
They could just add similar lvl players into the world at the start session..
---
The must add multi spawn locations, thats for sure...
---
Ok. I'll check and let you know later.
---
nice condescending gibberish
---
Mmmmmmmmmm.... sandwich board.
---
