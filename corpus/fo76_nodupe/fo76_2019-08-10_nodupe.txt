Make sure your intelligence high as you can when scrapping them to have a better chance
---
---
---
Yes, if the 100 guy has been focusing on his build the whole time. My level 25 killed a lv. 240 repeatedly with a Bloodoed Double Barrel.
---

---
It also depends on if the fight is "fair" i.e. explosive legacies, teslas, and Chinese scout armor aside.
---
All depends on the gear and the player skill really.
---
Regular weapons yes legendaries no
---
Some one told me lvl don’t matter in pvp even if the guy was lvl 50 it really depends on the build and weapons they have and lvl 50 is the last level you technically gain something after that all you can do is move points and select what perks you want each lvl past 50
---
It's still in beta and hasn't had any real updates since other than rewards and I think balances. There should be more than 2 maps and a whole lot more.
---
Wait people actually beleive the counter they show is real and accurate? Y'all know they just make sure it fills up by the deadline right? Lmao
---
You will get faster and far more points using 5.56 instead of 5mm.
---

---
Sounds like a mobile game then
---
Must be a pretty common place for camps for that to be happening.
---
It’s best to look it up in that site they’re all saying and the codes reset every week on tues or weds or maybe Thurs I always forget
---
And that player was John Woo.
---
Do the robots consider the ghouls guests? Is that why they're full?
---
That only happens to me when I sometimes log in to a server and the sky is all purple for 5 seconds, then the lighting on the ground is purple for about a minute, then it goes back to normal
---
Bulk to sell to vendors
---
Thanks anyway. I havent used PA either but i knew it had a combo heavy guns perk.
---
Todd won't let us fail, have faith
---
Murcia. It should be named “Murica.”
---
I will check out Angry Turtle now. Im on break so i can get some tid bits but i will be morw thorough later. Thank you.
---
None that I know of yet ): This patch hit the building community pretty hard. But they've since released a letter saying they're looking in to ways to fix this, so I think we might be getting double sided walls here soon. Sorry I couldn't be of more help. ):
---
If any are gonna fail it'll be this and cork.
---
I remove people that don't share perk cards. It kinda defeats the reason for teams aside from the xp bonus.
---
would have to have some cool feature, because a godroll set of secret service armor makes you practically invincible. i dont think any more resistance rolls will make a difference, there arent any enemies that require more than 400-500+ DR
---
Looks really cool
---
hey you forgot to blur out the team leaders name just a little friendly reminder that’s all I don’t want anything bad to happen to him
---
I’ll turn pacifist mode off for the first time ever and you can just sit there shooting me in the face?
---
Edit: I even have a private server you can do it on
---
He's on fire
---
Toooooooodd dammit
---
Idk. Bloodied power armor with Emergency protocols and bloodied Tesla rifle is pretty good. Really enjoy farming with it.
---
USA USA
---
alley oop more like ‘alley moo!’
---
more than that the lvl 500 will have all the perks and can perfectly spec for what ever weapon the RNG gods have bestowed upon them (along with more rolls of the RNG over those 400 levels) a lvl 50 will not have even one weapon perfectly speced.  Skill and gear matter even more and who gets the drop on who.  Who ever shoots first will win 95% of the time given equal gear and specs.
---
I killed lots of people once I hit level 60 ish. If you plan your build, you can be ready at 50
---
level is only tied to unlocking your special stat points, and what gear you can equip. once you hit level 50, all that matters is your perks and equipment. someone who plans out a build can be unstoppable at level 50 while someone who doesnt plan at all and takes random perks/weapons can be level 300 and be trash.
---
I want to place a jet ski next to the dock at my lakeside C.A.M.P.
---
the point is that you cant abuse it if people can back out, can't earn xp or get anything other than loot you placed (at most). The whole point of the rating system would be to incentivise people to create fun experiences for a higher rating. If you make a dumb trap dungeon that isn't fun or clever people will just vote it down. That is why the lounger is a good gimmick, it isn't even "real" in-game. So maybe there is a crate with loot that unlocks that is attached to the lounger (outside the simulation). Perhaps it would be as simple as a local leaderboard. If you disconnect it from the game economy enough it will keep the exploiters away. I think it would be fun enough to not need traditional rewards.
---
I don't feel good about plastic either. It may be in less demand with the Gauss weapons but it doesn't seem to be as nearly as plentiful as steal and it is used a lot for ammo and camp/workshop building. I'm a moderately heavy looter with Fallout 1st and I started the event with 10X more steel than all my other scrap. I don't have any reason to think my ratios should be much different others, I just maybe have way more scrap than the average player. If it nearly took us the full time to get the steel goal, I don't think we'll be able to meat the others...MAYBE wood later in the game...maybe. My wood to steel ration was maybe 1:5 so that's probably our best shot for making the next goal.
---
This. \^ most of my "heavy guns" weight at most 2 lbs, I carry around 20 at all times for all the major ammo types.  While most aren't bloodied, they all are magic thanks to 15% block armor, when the server speed cooperates.
---
The Minigun is way better for DPS, the gatling gun is better for efficient ammo use farming. (though with a magic weapon and short bursts ammo efficiency is nearly equal)
---
I think glass is the easiest out of all of them.  There are so many empty nuka bottles everywhere.  Nobody has tons because it’s useless.
---
This has been happening to me on PC.  The small wood piles work but the large ones nothing happens when I go to collect.  IE the ones at dolly sods campground
---
This is bugged for me. Anyone else? I'm stuck on 2 of 5 minutes, and I've been the storm countless times.
---
You're meant to spawn in there by design. You're meant to fight her around the fissure site in the nuke zone. If you ever did the mean story. The game give you Ultracite power armour which was the highest RR power armour literally to fight her and after people lost their power armour, they added the means to get the plans to create it free where you first got it. Saving you grinding them.
---
Given if you didn't do the main story to find that out. The game tells you to nuke the site, the community told the exact location so bloodied builds and non power armour builds wouldn't need to use it nor deal with rads. So the issue you want fixed would only be fixed if the community was willing to fight the SBQ the intended way.
---
Edit - bad spelling
---
I hope the brotherhood show up angry that their base is a hot mess since we never made quota on the majority of materials
---
Yup. I'm pretty sure the devs of Bethesda Austin actually was a mobile game Co before they were bought over
---
2 out of 5 minutes? I thought you only had to survive 1?
---
I get them all the time, so I use the opportunity to make "Wish You Were Here" and "Greetings from Whitespring" postcards using Photomode.
---
*Angry New California Republic noises*
---
Gratz on 52 levels in 7 days.  Get the drug recipes and make them yourself, don't pay more than 10 caps for them (actual drugs not recipes).  If you were on PC I'd make you a huge stash, first ones for free :P
---
Lacking that ghoul leaders drop 6 drugs each very often.  Run BMV - Whitesprings - Burrows (harper's ferry) over and over and you'll have suitcases full in a few days.
---
Bruh, you on PC? Sell it to me.
---
idk why but i can't analyze the blood sample, I  already got the blood sample but when try to analyze it says error on the pc, can you help me?
---
has it changed at all today? i heard they manually update these and i wouldnt be surprised if the person doing this took sunday.
---
The first time I did it during the quest line, I wasn't sure what I needed nor what was expected.  I did start it, but I didn't wait but a minute for help to arrive before I started.   I know next time.
---
Well, they are a very niche weapon lol. That would be awesome for SBQ though.
---
Imagine what could be achieved if everyone donated at least once rather than running out the increasingly stale excuse of 'Dupers will do it' or 'they will auto-complete it regardless' or other nonsense.
---
Players wanted a community collection event and they got it. It would be ironic if it then failed because too few took part. I bet there would be blame and recriminations for months.
---
Yes nukacrypt.  Resets on tuesdays
---
Don't forget to mention that NPC vendors do sell bulked concrete. If you want a cap sink because you're at 25k+ caps then that's a good way of burning your excess for this event.
---
Super duper does, if we get lucky!
---
Sell everything to max caps each day.  Scrap, crops, water, you name it.
---
I've been finding allot of players have them for sell, just hop around and look,
---
They're not likely to junk an asset even if we don't reach the goal, likely it will return at some point as either an atom shop purchase, freebie or tossed into a BoS associated loot table.
---
Idk what to tell you. I was I'm the same situation, I made 5 teslas but got it on the 3rd and now I got a mod on the same character that I'm trying to move to another.
---
I get a bunch of plastic off west tek runs and riding shotguns, scrapping those laser rifles for a solid 10 a pop
---
This would be much easier.
---
I agree man. So many BS things in the game.  Just trying to help lol
---
ah I would but I cant afford to do that, I just sell 1-3 star legendaries, outfits, armor, plans, and aid. but nobody buys which is weird.
---
So, with some of the comments and suggestions I've had so far, here is what I (potentially) came up with
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f373d87&amp;d=sq2s32sr2cu2ic4ip2a72a04lt2ee2ed2p52s22s01s12i11l21lp1sb0&amp;w=c52i71if0im1iq2ie0in1at1lm2i30
---
Can you place a turret on top? Only reason I'd buy it.
---
Indeed
---
I would donate, but unfortunately I don't have the storage to stock up on resources, and I sure as hell am not doing multiple days of server hopping for resources that I could use for other things. They set the goals way too high, expecting people to have thousands, but those who don't have FO1st, have probably just been selling bulk resources to maintain stash space (I know I have).
---
I feel like this event is more relying on FO1st members to donate, or people that don't have it and don't mind spending days of resource gathering rather than explore and have fun.
---
We get discounts on a few items a month from the atom shop.. nothing to write home about.. what makes 1st worth it is the tent and scrap box.  You get addicted to the tent. It is a free fast travel spot and if way over encombered you just find a bush by your tent drop your extra loot and fast travel to a train station and sell or scrap... then come back and get what you dropped... It saves so much time with getting your 1400 caps a day 🙂
---
Concrete is a hard enough resource to find in the wild, I am amazed that they asked for so much concrete for this. Heck I don't even think the dupers will have enough to pick up the slack. Pretty sure we won't be getting this one.
---
They typically put one or two FO1st items in the atom shop each month.   I THINK if you were to sub now, you would be able to claim the new items next month before your sub expires or renews.  Although, i'm sure you're aware, those items will not be accessible to recraft if you don't renew your sub.
---
I'm getting this too now? Any fixes? My only character is stuck out front. I fast traveled there and ctd'd, now everytime I re-log I ctd again?
---
NPC vendors sell bulked concrete and bulked cork.
---
1000% The low level has every single chance in the world.
---
Level past maybe 60 or so means exactly nothing in pvp.  It's just build + gear + skill that determines winner in pvp but you have enough lvls around 60ish depending on your build to have every perk you could possibly need to win in pvp.  Really you have about 80% of what you need around level 35.
---
I routinely pvp on low level characters,  normally from lvl 15 to around lvl 40, then I delete and remake the character to start over.  I kill high lvl enemies 100+, 200+. 300+ and beyond every single day.  I mostly win because the other guys are not setup for pvp and/or don't know how to pvp well.
---
When I lose again the other guys level is a lot less important than their build, gear, and how well they use it.  competent well geared players with builds at least decently setup for pvp will tend to roll my low level thanks to my inferior armor and weapons that don't quite punch through theirs.
---
It is definitely obtained from scrapping.  I guess you've just been unlucky.  Keep scrappin'
---
I looked last night and didn’t see it.
---
[removed]
---
Oh yeah might have to put my tent near by!
---
You should put a prime reciver on the gatling gun, its damage increase is worth it and you wouldn't be wasting the ultracite ammo like on mini gun. Solves your same ammo problem.
---
You should probably have a good think about why it makes you angry that there's strong female characters in the game. That's pretty depressing someone would go out of their way like that to insult the writers of a video game for a silly reason like that. That's exactly the kind of platitudinous rhetoric that makes people call gamers misogynist losers.
---
Nope
---
Go through Morgantown airport. Kill every scorched. Take EVERYTHING off their body. Pick up all the chems as well. Waddle over to the train station. Sell everything to the robot vendor. 
---
Also stop fast traveling and buying stuff. Caps will add up fast
---
It annoys me when people freeze or stun her mid air.  Just let her land so I can bash her skull in.
---
How does this work? Do I just need a bashing minigun and smack stuff with it?
---
any ideas if it was a specific kind of base
---
mk I'll try that thank you
---
got it's terrible. No one ever nukes down low so you can fight the queen outside the zone
---
This is false. If your subscription ends, you can still craft any free outfits claimed in the atomic shop.
---
Well crap the server connection died while I was in the last goddamn room!
---
How do you find enough space to store everything? I'm a newbie to this game too (love the fallout games but didn't have the money to spend on a game without a lot of the features I like about bethesda games, so I just got it on gamepass) and I have already hit the 800lb storage limit and even went and bought a plan for a different type of storage... only to find it too is connected to the 800lb limit. Now I'm out almost 700 caps and have no solutions...
---
Was this on xbox?
---
I wouldn't call it irony, I would say it was bad planning on the game-runners side. This is simple math and I would hope they have the data to solve the equations (if not, then they are very poor product managers). They should know how much scrap of each type all players have and they should be able to calculate how much scrap the average player can generate per hour--perhaps add in some margin for players focusing on more looting and scrapping than normal and maybe extra traffic for the event. Maybe they don't have the data or were too lazy/short sighted to check--this would be bad product management. Maybe they overestimated how much extra looting players were willing to do or miscalculated how much looting players CAN do. There is also relatively low incentive for us to extra looting because most everyone is focusing on score and the rewards for turning in scrap at the individual level (the BoS Atlas ration rewards) and at the community level are fairly underwhelming.
---
In case you don’t realise, you can go to train stations and certain other places and sell directly to a robot vendor. A slow but steady way to make caps is to build a bunch of water filters and sell water to the robot vendors for example. Or walk through the forest, murder a bunch of animals, and cook and sell their meat to the robots.
---
Looks great!
---
Believe he is saying he sells to vendors to pull their 1400 daily cap pool. Sell them guns you pick up, extra aid etc. A run through Blackwater mine can net some good caps. Assault rifles can pick up almost 30 caps a piece with Hard Bargain equipped.
---
Doesn’t that require flux to make? I rarely launch nukes because I lose tons of carry weight when I enter power armor or stealth armor, so much so that I hate entering nuke zones.
---
I have noticed being placed into the same server time and time again.  It would be nice if there was a wider pool of servers but who knows how it works.
---
Accelerated barrel mod on a minigun with bashing damage causes the game to over calculate how much damage you 
---
Are doing when shooting
---
Damn...
---
Yea
---
It seems to be server related for me ... I assume this is not a log you already collected and is on cool down (then other bug where you get the collect button on a log you just collected) ... I am Xbox .. and yes on big stacks and the multiple logs especially, now that jaydizzy82 said it ... Yes 🙂 .. anyway jumping servers made it to away on my farming spot that I hit daily.
---
You must be a real hoot at parties.
---
even against people using gear ppl see as op you can still win more than they lose if the other guy isn't experienced.  chinese stealth armor for example means no dense torso means they melt if you use an explosive and have trash dr so just fold like a lawnchair the instant you get shots on them.
---
Legacies and teslas also don't mean an instant "i win" if the other guy has poor awareness and you can get the drop on them.
---
Are you on pc?
---
No one really wanted this event so it's okay it has low player engagement. Beth will learn one day.
---
Ah, thanks for the clarification.
---
Honestly 2 to 3 minutes is probably ideal. When the call goes out across the server, in my experience on PS4 players arrive quickly soon after. By the time 2 to 3 minutes has passed there would usually be at least 5 high level players with more joining in. You dont need to run the timer down much more than that unless no one is turning up. The best way to help ensure success is to pay a bit of attention to the other public events, specially the ones like Line in the Sand, Guided Meditation, Uranium Fever, Scorched Earth etc. If theres a good turnout for those then you will likely get a good turnout for Encryptid too. If they get a poor turnout then save your card for another time.
---
Build water purifiers. Sell water to vendors.
---
Loot weapons etc off all enemies. Morgantown airport and the event there, Collision Course where there's waves of low level Scorched. I used to do that event all the time in the beginning.
---
Loot items in environment and sell.
---
I have various recipes to make chems which I then sell. Disease Cure sells well in my vendor and sells for a good price to robot vendors.
---
Perk cards:
---
Cap collector gives a chance for finding more caps in cap stashes.
---
Super duper when crafting gives a chance to double amount of things you craft. Also Chemist, doubles amount of chems you make.
---
Get the level 3 Hard Bargain card in perks to push up the amount vendors will pay for any items sold.
---
Off the top of my head.
---
Thanks, I'll try that out!
---
Sell water and crops to the npc vendors, not at your camp.
---
It's easy to plant some extra crops, and after you craft your food and drink needs, sell the rest at a train station.  1 cap per unit but it adds up if you keep doing it.  Also, when I'm going to a train station I pick up every empty bottle, coffee mug, and dishrag I see.  Just the worthless crap you don't really need for components.  Don't scrap them.  Fill up on worthless junk on your way to the vendor and then sell it for 1 cap per.  It won't make you rich, but it is more profitable than selling weapons and armor (by weight).  You can make enough to fund a conservative fast travel budget so your other caps don't get sucked away from travelling.
---
And it doesn't allow you to use the speedy barrel, which gives similar dps vs non-scorched and works better with the vamp effect.  Go speedy, not primed, imo, for this gun.
---
Set up industrial water purifiers in your camp and collect the water to sell it, make sure to get the hard bargain perk if you have at least 3 points of charisma. 
---
You should sell it to NPC vendors and not your camp’s vendor, because you’re least likely to sell to real players. You can get a maximum of 1400 caps per day from selling to vendors. 
---
And selling water isn’t the only way to get caps, it’s just the easiest way if you don’t want to go out of your way to get things to sell. But you can sell pretty much everything to vendors except plans and ammo, so if you have unneeded weapons or armor make sure to sell them
---
I can tell you one has already been created, but a release date has not been determined.
---
You may want to look at some of u/jimski_ovkorski posts.
---
You seriously think they should waste even a second removing a feature just because?  Even if it's useless it doesn't hurt anything by just existing.
---
Oh, fuck yeah! Spoil me, daddy!
---
I think it will take more than one shot to kill me, but he downed himself with one shot. I did die before him though.
---
Thank you
---
Definitely fewer legendaries.
---
Thanks for the info
---
First time?
---
We won’t, Bethesda will.
---
I am just happy that they are not trying to have me part with my 1200 screw. I worked really hard to hoard them bitches. They would have to pry them off my dead lifeless body.
---
Ah, farming laser guns is a great idea!
---
ANY time you see the event "Uranium Fever" pop up, go to it and shoot all the mobs you see.  At the end of the event, pick up *all* the items they dropped and then walk your overweight ass to the Whitesprings Station and sell it all.  Easy max caps each day. 
---
If you're low level, I recommend loading up on *all* the meat enemies drop, cooking it and then selling it.  You should also go down to the Billings Homestead workshop, equip the green thumb perk, and pick ALL the razorgrain to cook into razorgrain soup. Just north of there is Silva Homestead - Pick all the corn there adn turn to corn soup.  This will make you a ton of food that you can sell (you also get xp for creating it).
---
It's not how many cards are being shared, but how many points the card shared costs. You'd see a "1" if someone shared their 1-rank better critical card, or a "3" if they shared a 3-rank version of it.
---
They still have time to stealth edit the bravo collection event in a few weeks and drop the goals to about 10% the current goals to save face. Alpha is a little trickier because if they intended to cheat and pretend we succeeded they never would have reported that low of total for the first day when it was only 3 days for concrete.
---
I got it and the jumpsuit drops as a new player. Thought they were generic low level crap drops. Scrapped them all.
---
s u p e r rare random encounter anywhere a megasloth can spawn
---
Just buy it it's way easier 1100 caps that's all I needed
---
It was on PC.
---
how do we get the rewards?
---
From my experience most players don't know how to start the event and think it is similar to other public event where someone has to perform a action to start it. Plus I had people 400+ start it after I used my own keycard because they think they can solo it.
---
I think if they change it, they should reduce the timer to around 3 minutes and have it so regardless of if you want it or not, the event only starts after the timer.
---
That or just have people undergo training for the event because for something so simple, every time I do it I'm the only one who does the pylons.
---
Because it's a gimmick perk that only ever gets brought up by people just getting into the game mode and is generally ignored by everyone else.
---
The points and slot are better put to use elsewhere, Goat Legs has saved my ass more times than Frog Legs ever did.
---
If you're up against a bunny hopper then just don't fight them, it's easy enough to run away from people in NW assuming you haven't fucked up entirely and ended up in  the middle of nowhere with zero cover surrounded by an entire team.
---
There is no difference between 100 and 500 except the time put into the character
---
Let it be a warning that us Vault Dwellers aren't going to be pushed around.
---
I did some more testing even after getting my game to work a lot better and it is definitely the ash piles I'm getting pixelation during events with multiple ash piles.  I no longer get crash to desktop after updating my drivers but the ash piles are very much the problem.  looking at them slows framerate the area around them becomes pixelated and there is no doubt that they are the problem. I tested with meat piles go piles and ash piles as well as combinations and the ash piles alone are enough to cause the problem.
---
I was stuck in the same place, but I just got it to work!
---
* Quit to Desktop and reload the game.
---
* Immediately go to the terminal and analyze the blood sample.
---
* Then, plug in the T-Fuse.
---
It's super counterintuitive, but it prompted me for the next step of the quest after doing it in this order. Good luck.
---
I was thinking of getting Fallout 76 so I was wondering is it worth it? I would love to build a B.o.S group that goes by the norm of confiscating pre-war technology from people and if they don't oblige just nuke em out of the face of Appalachia or hunt them down and take it by force. You know a little role play
---
Wasn't there a  perk and Fallout 4 that made specific junk items in the environment glow if you had them taggedt for search?
---
Go to Fort Defiance. Grab every straight jacket you find. If your intelligence is above 10 and you have hard bargain equipped, they sell for 50 caps each. Same for golf outfits and skirts at Whitesprings. Server hop and repeat. You’ll clear out the robot vendors caps in no time.
---
Might want to reinstall I have no issues
---
Since they changed the menu, I stop using it because I now need to know exactly what and how much ammo I have to actually spend less time than before.
---
This issue you and what seems like others in the comments has had just makes me less likely to use it.
---
All I hear is excuses. It will fail &gt; I refuse to take part &gt; It Will Fail.
---
Why should Bethesda bother in the future if events fail not because they are impossible - and collecting concrete may be harder than steel but is certainly not impossible - but because Selfish (and yes I think that's a fair assessment of many of the moaners) attitudes?
---
I got it from a devroom box that one of my friends spawned in during the november spawn hack 😏
---
Every time they've updated NW people scream about how they aren't focusing enough on Adventure updates.  Every time they add challenges/cosmetics to NW people scream about how they're being "forced" to play the mode.  They had more in store for NW, there's already at least one unreleased map for Harpers Ferry in the game files.  But they probably figure why put in the effort when large portions of the community are just going to shit on them for trying?
---
I've been trying to do my part but I will be shocked if we hit the mark...
---
I try to play every day, some times not, usually anytime during the week after 330 P EST :) 
---
iBlackHandx 
---
2 characters, one sneak lvl 150
---
Second 105 heavy gunner bloody
---
It depends on who has more nuka-quantums to spam
---
Probably just nooking them I with a grenade launcher and you weren't on the team
---
Welcome back.
---
Any tips on project paradise?
---
Another great idea ruined by the fact that people would just run around with swastika x-01 unfortunately.
---
welcome to the dark side
---
Yea I have starched genes but I'm working on getting class freak now so I'm not penalized by the mutations as bad, lol
---
Steel and plastic are easy since  you get some naturally during normal play (just farm NPCs like Mutants, scrap  all weapons, done.)
---
Concrete and Cork are not in that case: you have to farm them specifically, and it's not fun at all to get such amount.
---
I thing we will miss the mark
---
I wouldn’t get it for freebies (cosmetics).  Just the scrap box, tent, and private server (to farm resources)
---
Gnomes, surprisingly, can give concrete according to the wiki.
---
No, it was scheduled a year after the bombs dropped.
---
A persons level doesn't matter in pvp
---
I'm lvl 90 I've kicked a lvl 500's ass before
---
1 in 20? My horde of white wolf fedoras would like to have a word lol
---
The caps and gold doesn't bother me but I would love and get much use out of a safe cross character item to transfer stuff.
---
I am in my fifties and have learned to pvp. There was a learning curve.
---
You can sell 1400 caps worth to vendors daily. Legendaries are better of scripping unless they’re valuable.
---
It’s also just a lvl thing. The higher lvl you are, the easier it becomes. A friend and I have a small group that like to play together, but he joined much later. One member asked, “you guys need any caps? I can help” he responds, “oh no I’m doing great. I’ve already got 300 caps.” 
---
It’s just a matter of time. Eventually you’ll be fast travel I’ll Ing every just to keep your caps from reaching max daily
---
See ya, dont let the door hit ya on the way out!

I mean, I've donated and gathered. In all, I probably spent 8 hours farming concrete for this event and donated 90% of what I had on hand...probably around 10K total. And I donated 90% of my steel and looted another 5K for maybe 75K total steel...so I don't think selfish is a fair assessment for people that are doing their part. It is entirely possible for a person to participate, encourage others to participate, and think it was a poorly planned event. None of those conflict with one another.
---
I second bloody mess! I run it too, forgot in my previous comment
---
It’s disappointing that the people who would benefit the most from this- newer players- can help the least. As a gamespass player I legit didn’t even know cork was a resource until this event was announced, and yet the double score challenge is the most important goal for me, since we started part way through the season...
---
It's fairly ridiculous, yeah. I can't think of a single other game company that could get away with Fo76.
---
Yes. Paintjobs/skins are perfect for that.
---
It’s literally just the Christmas present stuff. So it’s not worth it if you are going for rewards.
---
The door would bug out on the way out, so it couldnt. Flippant disregard for the disaster that is this game doesn't make you cool btw.
---
Yes and a guaranteed nuke case in arktos when you are on the Morgantown map
---
Well, he's not wrong.  At a certain point, you have to put your foot down and examine how content was made and realize that if the content isn't given any sort of restrictions and freely allows players to do things in a certain way that can be unfair to others, that's on Bethesda entirely.
---
For example, players who kill legendary enemies in one shot might be considered bad etiquette during events, but there's nothing in the game that neither discourages them, or prevents them from doing so.  It's very much a Reddit thing to have a grievance with it and an unofficial etiquette guideline, but players have given feedback on it being an issue.  It's still on Bethesda for not considering those sorts of factors in the game, especially if it's a long-standing issue that the playerbase continues to give negative feedback on.
---
Why shouldn't Bethesda be blamed for allowing other players to start an event that another player needs to spend the time and resources to start like Encryptid?  You can be mad if a player is purposely doing it to be annoying, but again, Bethesda is at the root of this fault here for allowing another player to interfere with another player's work and playing experience in the first place.  If Bethesda was more reactive to feedback in a timely matter, or they had some foresight they might have realized "Hey, maybe make it so the terminal/event can only be started by the player who had the card".
---
I have 50k plastic mainly from scrapping super sleges and laser rifles from WestTek. I don't want use it get garbage kits from the BOS. This is whole thing will fail miserably.
---
It accumulates. You can step in and out.
---
Yea thats exactly my reason for it, but I like to get value for money and free stuff is nice ether way.
---
Also fury is acting weird in NW and protects against rads and health damage but only in the storm
---
This is the main problem I find. Bad rewards, high cost. Couple that with the recent debacle surrounding the update, causing a lot of long time players to quit and we have a pretty big issue on our hands with less and less players meaning the events aren't getting done and Bethesda might see this as the game dying and giving up hope on it. Hope it gets sorted soon
---
Well the christmas gifts have plans in them sometimes (I have found a few)
---
The rewards are junk. Why donate?
---
If you have 2 accounts, yes.  best would be to have a friend help.  Just log on with old character, give everything to friend, log in new account, load on friends server, get all your stuff back.
---
You could hypothetically do all of that without using your friend to store everything for you as you switch accounts but it would be riskier cause if server crashes or someone comes along to grab your stuff it's lost and there's no way to transfer caps.
---
Note you can only transfer items and caps, not bullion, scrip, or other account bound things like score for the legendary race.
---
I've done 1k today, but if I did ten or a hundred times that I couldn't make up for the number of people boycotting the event for often spurious reasons. Sadly there's no unique rewards for taking part so every wins or loses together.
---
Its not too rare hahah, its  people want rewards for thing's everyone gets. 2/3rds of the Fallout 1st member I know of have so much junk these numbers are reasonable. Doesn't mean they don't want to denote it because dispute having around 100,000 concrete and cork, they don't care for a reward which everyone gets.  In fact if the hat and flag were like 0.00000000000000000001% chance to drop from the creates they'd be more inclined to do so because then not everyone would have it.
---
Nuking right on top of Lake Eloise gets a very large amount of cobalt and nuking the turtle on the map gets a lot of violet.
---
I hope we get new maps. I never played nuclear winter until it was easy score but I've found I actually enjoy it. The incredibly long wait times for finding matches though need to be improved and a new map with some variety can definitely help it get interesting again
---
I am unfortunately a fence and tent dweller and I feel we are getting a bit of hate right now that isn't totally fair.  The SBQ almost always lands when I am there. 
---
I am a low health build that does a butt ton of damage saving the brave paladins of the grasslands a bunch of ammo. I unlike my brave strong brethren of the bog, am not so sturdy and must hide from the damage over time mine field that is the grassy areas.  
---
To repay your bravery I sit on my perch and destroy all the little creatures that run for the ankles of my paladins braving the grasslands.  Especially when I know you have the nectar of the gods in you inventory know as flux.  I loot only once I know you are safe. 
---
So please at least consider that maybe it is not the act of finding a perch but rather the stagger perks in specials that are the issue.
---
You can wear a backpack with any of those except PA but then you have calibrated shocks. And you can eat a grilled radstag or some death claw steak to make up for the unyielding
---
Yes it does. It also works for shotguns
---
Most of it most of the community has already. There’s nothing new specifically for the event.
---
You don't need to dupe steel to get massive amount.
---
Yeah this should be of been that way for a start. I've got over 300 and on console the sliders are horrible trying to get to 20 where it should be the auto default
---
I don’t have enough resources to throw away.
---
Explosive radium rifles are legacy and rare at that explosive fixers are more common but still hard to get
---
That fireplace secret door looks sick af at 99. Maybe just me.
---
I’m very curious when they check those numbers. Even an underwhelming number of donations doesn’t rationalize why concrete is so low. We won’t see day 2 till early tomorrow, it may be that Bethesda posted a number way too early in the event compared to the actual number at 24hrs.
---
Like I said, wait till tomorrow. Then we can figure out how bad it is.
---
Purple Drink
---
- 1 Grape Mentats
---
- 1 Mutfruit
---
- 1 Vodka
---
- 1 Disease Cure 
---
- 1 Med-X
---
Or better yet remove notes and just give me bullion directly
---
Saved
---
This is a really good point and something I thought about as well. My hope is that they have not updated the tracker in awhile and we'll see a big jump tomorrow--I would be thrilled to be proven wrong.
---
The load time are insane for a BR where you can die within seconds
---
oh that's odd, I'll be patient. thank you :D
---
this is actually amazing advice, thank you so much
---
I been saying this for a while; camp placement should just overwrite a tent standing there.
---
They're easy, and free, to move.. and that is their purpose anway.
---
Unlike buggy camp building you can never put a blueprinted base down.
---
Bru I’m level 98 and I usually don’t even wear armor
---
Also i know there’s a chance for a blueprint to spawn in the building next to the free states robot in Berkeley springs
---
We also wanted rewards that would be worth going after
---
If its lvl 50 and has 'bloodied' on it, you should take a closer look.  Also bolstering armor.
---
oh okay that sounds easy, will do thanks :D
---
I have played around with it and I paired it with lifegiver and bufftats. I only found it really works against automatics. I did mine with pa and it only kick in like 3 times and 1 times I went down. 
---
Only other time, I was caught in the fire and was being revived all the way from the power plant to morgantown high school. It was the only thing that kept my alive with no stims
---
Before you try being a smart arse, might want to get your facts straight, I asked how I could increase rep, i didn't ask why they were hostile. But you know, everyone jumped on your little band wagon before validating your stupid comment.
---
Tried that with mine, which is windows on one side and rolling garage door on the other, (my “shop” wall) and when I try to place it, I either get “item needs support” or “item is floating”.
---
So no power armor halfway through a brick wall....
---
Dammit that's my spot
---
alright I'll do that, thanks :D
---
Calibrated shocks is 100 extra, pepperoni roll is 30 more.  Chemist backpack is 60 carry plus 90% chem reduction plus 3 open perk slots. Full unyielding is 15 extra strength. Just getting in power armor bumps carry down by almost 100, plus losing other perks (bear arms 3) makes weight go way up. I'd like to be able to carry what I loot...
---
Hmmm it works with double doors though
---
pretty smart way of doing it, thanks
---
Travelling leather coat
---
You’ll get metal and combat plans as rewards from the main and side quests.
---
Armor and other plans can often be found near crafting benches. 
---
Get a mic and talk to high levels in their camps. Folks in this game are often happy to help.
---
I have 1st AND a bank character and still manage to struggle with that 800 limit
---
The Charleston court house typically has some light metal armor plans near the holding cells, and the cabins near the top of the world are a good place to find some plans, including trapper armor. Other than that, treasure maps and events are the only other way to get them that I know of.
---
Try reading (scrolling) to the end of the EULA text, then accepting.  Not sure in FO76 specifically but many require that.
---
Oh no you've got to craft and crush for those mods just like the rest of us
---
I like the idea of Super Duper
---
no xbox
---
I really hope so! Even if they aren’t great rewards the collector in me wants to feel like I’ve earned this stuff.
---
oh okay sweet I'll try that
---
I just unlocked this mod yesterday. I crafted about 15 telsas then scrapped them until it unlocked.
---
Vanguard is good, life saving could work if you're always incapacitated
---
&gt;People who (purposely) do crappy things shouldn't be excused
---
If the game mechanics allow players to do crappy things,  ***then they are going to do crappy things.***  This fact has been demonstrated time and again in online games. Which is why the game mechanics should not allow it to happen.  Buy they do.
---
I'll see to that, thank you
---
Just a fortified position. Metal walls, concrete barriers, ramparts, guard towers, those large tents. 
---
You could add a HQ with a Briefing Room (glow in the dark wall map is good for this), Barracks, Officers Quarters, Mess Hall, Brig (jail cell), Med Bay, Shooting Range. 
---
Or you could do a Red Rocket Station (original I know) with a secret BOS bunker in it. Bonus points for adding it underground.
---
Can't help there, sorry.
---
Top post!  I don't think I've ever seen Morgantown nuked.  Helvetia a few times during the parade week.  It's always been the SBQ zone or Whitesprings.  Good info here!
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
There’s not enough concrete in the damn world, and this patch is the straw that breaks my idiot camel’s back. There’s 4 bags on the Gorge bridge which is inevitably cleaned out on every server. Like everything else in this game, is incredibly imbalanced to the point of being broken. As a long term player, it becomes harder and harder with each patch to defend the horrible design and engineering decisions this team makes. I worked in game development for 15 years with EA and Ubisoft, I’m not some neckbeard muggle who doesn’t understand “durr, durr don’t you know game development is hard...”. This is plain economy stuff though - whether it’s broken main quest lines, infuriating weapon nerfs, naked pay to win microscams,  reputation bugs and ammo, bullion and caps limits designed to punch your most dedicated players in the balls, nonsensical VATS calculations, damage bugs that always round wildly down...you guys are total clowns. And we understand that you need to create a world where you burn through materials in gorging bursts so that you then need to grind to find more, and repeat cycle - but this game is a biblical piece of deliberately broken crap. Bailing out of my second lvl 150 character because after all the apologizing and benefit of the doubt I’ve given this occasionally brilliant game - there’s only two conclusions - that you are as incompetent as you seem and you don’t know what you’re doing, or you do and your precise goal IS to seek out or create addicted whales, and in the process fuck the rest of the community over in an abusive relationship designed to tap into some toxic level of invested pointless late game sadomasochism that reduces the entire experience to nothing but a chore of pointless dailies. Either way, goodbye, Fallout.
---
They don’t have any desire to dump stuff into this when all the rewards available they had duped since Christmas since it keeps getting reused. I don’t know about you but a banner doesn’t sound like it would be worth hundreds of thousands of materials and that’s assuming they even had that much. 
---
Cork is pointless. Nearly no one has it, it’s way worse to collect than concrete, and anyone who would’ve duped it already hit level 100 on the board with god mode in the early weeks. They don’t need a double score weekend.
---
No doubt the next request will make this perk card passive because the only real perk cards are combat ones.
---
:(
---
OMG YES!!!!
---
I setup on the train bridge easy of Harper's ferry, trying to set up an open market along the tracks
---
I run bloodied and I carry a full set of TS gear with me so I can tank or solo Encrypted. Pop a few rad-aways, equip First Aid rank 3, pop some psychobuff, eat anything that increases max hp (so stims heal more), and if you're a carnivore, finish off with either Radstag Stew or Roast Megasloth for 60-88% energy damage reduction. Toss in any vampire's weapon and it's actually hard to die unless you get distracted using VATS
---
Edit - I also use both Serendipity rank 3 and Ricochet rank 3. Ricochet works on her eye beam
---
Isn't there an empty floor at the top of the Whitespring?  Seems like a missed opportunity.
---
I only have 200.. supers save the day please unless u didnt dup concrete which is understandable
---
Plastic is doable i hoard the stuff for bulk crafting its not  that hard to get. but cork and concrete jeez that's unrealistic. Frigging morons need to hire testers if they aren't gonna test it themselves.
---
Tried to do my part too. Good on both of you for trying to do well for the community. Here’s hoping we receive a miracle tomorrow. Still got time.
---
You must be 18 years old to enter.....
---
*THE O HOLE*
---
going to say if we actually reach the amount they want they are either lying or dupers did it
---
Jumping into a subreddit that’s not run by Bethesda to drop your complaint post doesn’t make you cool, either. 
---
Also, learn to make direct replies instead of new comments.
---
I play pretty much every night. GT: dydamas
---
I think he might have a lot of problems he's trying to hide from.
---
Also if the BoS did that, I'd love it. I'd love it so much I'd actually just give Bethesda money to do this.
---
I am intrigued and will try this the moment I can. #hopelives
---
Steel should have a high requirement, who doesn't have thousands upon thousands of Steel?
---
But concrete and cork? HA! It proves they don't play as those are the hardest materials to come by
---
Safes have a lot of plans in them.  Get your lockpick to 3.  Or find  level 400 plus player on your server. They usually sell most plans for 1 cap.  Just trying to make room
---
They have assets for new maps.  They were datamined around a year ago I believe.
---
Yeah, this the other "survive for 5 minutes" challenge.
---
These days High Radiation Fluids seem to drop less frequently than the Masses.  Wish BETH would  revert the percentages so that they are equally likely  :(
---
Workshops are PvP Zones. The game advises you of this every time you attempt to claim or contest one.
---
If you don’t want to engage in PvP, don’t take workshops.
---
Sitting in boring Enclave presentation in conference room &gt; open pip boy &gt; boot up Fallout 76 &gt; play Whitesprings quests &gt; go sit in boring Enclave presentation in conference room &gt; open pop boy...
---
Couldn't agree more, concrete and cork targets are insanely unrealistic. It's either incompetence, intentionally unattainable (so we don't get Double Dailies for extra SCORE) or done so they can come in looking like the good guys when they say "sorry our bad, that target was impossible to reach so we'll turn it on anyway".
---
I'm just happy the BoS Collectron reward hand in is cloth, anyone know what things it will collect?
---
Laughs in unyielding
---
Thanks, I keep holding out for more concrete building plans to come out, maybe I'll get luckily at some point. And this whole bunker thing makes me wonder if concrete is going to be really important in the future.
---
that'd be cool, not trying to insult you but want any kind of reward? can give you stimpaks, junk, etc ........ if you want some caps, we can arrange a trade where you sell me 1 item for the amount of caps decided
---
Yeah but they haven't done anything with them. A rotation of at least 4 maps would be far more interesting then only 1 being chosen put of two options
---
Took time to make... lol.
---
What time? They already have the BoS emblem design, model for the banner, probably even the background texture for the banner itself.
---
It's less than an hour's work for a texture artist at most. That's for a slow one. It'd take more time for management approval than the actual work required to do the work.
---
 Random open pvp areas with high drop on the map would be great, unskilled players could dodge them
---
Worst part is that a lot of advertised and promised stuff isn't even in 1st yet.
---
I canceled my sub too a few weeks ago because realisticly I don't even need it anymore. Got junk that'll last years, which I don't even use because I have hundreds of repair kits from all the queens &amp; encrypted because there's nothing else to do in the game.. I do miss the tent sometimes but now I just drop anything I don't feel like hauling to a stash.. which is about everything.
---
Unfortunately that's the entire game mechanic in a nutshell. Don't claim workshops and you won't open yourself up to attack.
---
Knowing Bethesda, any reward we don’t automatically win will become an Atomic Shop item. They might as well just go ahead and release a bundle of all of them and call this whole “community donation event” a bust. When you don’t put a stop limit on your donation boxes and let players effectively throw resources into the void, you’ve totally lost your community.
---
Reskinned holliday gifts v3 lmao
---
Marsupial off the top of my head
---
I mean they could put it in a different map I guess. but to me that would just be a cosmetic change.   Flatwoods and Morgantown pretty much offer the same kind of experience.  At the end of the day, it's just a shrinking circle of fire and players shooting at each other.
---
Yep. On PS4. Very annoying.
---
Nah, just shoot me in the face is fine. Username is Blaketopia. I’m doing project paradise atm but I’ll meet up after this :)
---
Edit: OH WAIT! Let’s trade kills? Lol
---
Plus SCORE objectives are just take the workshop, not take and defend
---
Yea i told him that but we figured since it would be a quick thing and there was not realy any "high" level people on our world it be fine. But almost immediately swooped in. Just did a non pvp even and he popped up and for some reason  he causes me to lag. Everywhere else and other players im fine.
---
Not my first rodeo but i turned wotaga into into a glowing sea
---
You can Google "fallout 76 builds" and you'll see nukesdragons on the top of the list, that will help you tremendously
---
Yes. With daily limits and all
---
I love the Turtles accent!
---
Speed demon too. Don't realize how much I love it until I play my alt or fo4.
---
Thorn armor is superior for stealth.
---
Imagine if they took the cool down time off of the silos the whole map would be a nuke zone
---
Class freak and starched genes are worth the 5 special points in luck
---
Marsupial, speed demon are probably the best two that dont have any bad side effects
---
Chameleon is only useful in certain builds, but has no side effects
---
Electrically charged, plauge walker, and unstable isotope have no adverse effects. Besides plauge walker, that increases disease duration
---
Adrenal reaction is worth the health loss in any situation as it's a good plan B
---
Twisted muscles adverse effects aren't really noticeable. Just being slightly less accurate with firearms
---
Grounded is a must if you dont use any energy weapons
---
Healing factor is worth it if you dont use chems in a build
---
Honestly workshops are pointless to defend. Just claim them and move on. Free xp that's all
---
Marsupial and Speed Demon. You can also get a perk card (i believe it's class freak?) that can make the negatives slightly negated
---
Its a game mechanic, although it is a douchebag move to pick on lowbies, you cant get too butthurt when you agree to PVP.
---
That's an awesome build. Would really like to see what the interiors were like.
---
And I SURVIVED!! *Maniacal laughter as the ashy embers crumble off my body*
---
Could you imagine though lol.
---
My main quest is now bugged. How do you manage to break more than you fix every update?
---
Do you notice the side effects?
---
Awesome, idk why i didn't look for an online character builder, ty for this.
---
I dont get why there are level 100s wearing the excavator armor? Isnt it worse than all the t45 t60 and ultracite and xo1 and stuff?
---
They can't do anything right, can they? 😉😂
---
Not really a jerk, just kinda playing the content.  You're warned when trying to take a workshop it's a pvp zone after you claim it.  If it wasn't then people could claim them and sit on them forever.  Most people claim workshops and move on.  Imo there's no reason to sit on a workshop once claimed, you get more resources by running around killing stuff and looting places.
---
I bloody hope not, the amount of crap is getting rediculous
---
Yup. Do X fetch quest for
---
Y reward of 20 BoS bitcoin
---
On xbox I've just opened up the pip boy then go back and it's all there.
---
You’re making a lot of assumptions. 
---
First, the objective is just to build decorations, in a workshop **OR** camp. 
---
Second, just because you didn’t see any high level players on the map doesn’t mean they aren’t there. If you’re crouched, you don’t show up to non-team mates. So next time, stay crouched in workshops. 
---
Also, stash your junk before you go taking a workshop. 
---
Once you learn the nuances, you can avoid PvP 99.99% of the time.
---
I think if anything they should use the Gold Bullion to allow for a grind for more faction items.
---
sounds cool to me .... i'll be on in about 20mins if that's cool
---
While I don't know how this works with something that is incorporated into a game that is not in beta, it usually allows game companies to push updates and changes without going through the full testing process that companies like Microsoft require. For example, this is largely why Fortnite remained in beta for so long. With the infrequent updates NW recieves I doubt this is this case.
---
Labeling something as "beta" also serves as a bit of an easy out when people complain or things go wrong. They can simply say it's a work in progress and doesn't represent the final product.
---
I'm sure there are a host of other reasons. And I have a feeling they'll ditch it at some point only to reintroduce it as a "new" feature somewhere down the line.
---
Meat piles at sbq are essentially invisible.
---
Stimpacks just based on the fact that you build up more then you can use at a certain point.
---
Thumbs up
---
Took my friend 4 hrs on a private to do the raider vault
---
Lady Devin, what most likely happened is just like how they accidentally changed the sequin dress into the gala dress, they used the brotherhood fatigues underarmor and changed it into the outfit that we get from fortifying atlas and since they didn't seperate them, it changed all brotherhood fatigues into outfits
---
If they do another faction event...I would prefer having the option of having  the 76ers as an option. Then again, the overseer would probably railroad us again.
---
I just run into these crime scenes..
---
lol
---
With the introduction of the infamous gold bullion system I'm guessing most expansions high end loot will be bought through it
---
Awesome thanks just a question to scrap all junk all the time
---
Agreed!
---
No worries
---
I know that, but I feel like a full set of Unyielding AP Heavy Combat Armour with stuff like Reduced Weapon Weight and Better Sneaking is worth, like, 2 okay legacies, minimum, to say nothing of one that only hits "passable" because it's explosive or a non-legacy that's kinda rare. I didn't even want something like a Bloodied or a Junkie's one; I would've taken an Executioner's or even Medic's.
---
If we can't make the quota BoS shouldn't come. *Fake cries*
---
How is it broken?
---
The NCR didn't kill them all, nor is it canonized, otherwise there'd be no BoS in Fallout 3/NW/4. 
---
In fact 3 tells you that they were around as the East Cast BoS couldn't of gotten orders or even cut off from a dead faction. 
---
NW literally tells you about other West Coast Chaptures and Veronica wasn't even from Chapture in NW and the DLC has a lot of references to other Chaptures and Elder Elija background involves being a part of and being high ranking in multiple Chapters.
---
In Fallout 4 Elder Maxson reunited both West and East Coast BoS.
---
In short, the NCR didn't wipe out the Brotherhood. They were at war, won and then remained on hostile terms. The conan never said or even implied the NCR killed of BoS.
---
Thanks for this I walked by the duffel bag and then I remembered your tip and went back to it
---
Np. Also there are a bunch of videos on YouTube if you want to try that out. Search rifle build, heavy gunner, etc. And captainoob has a deep inventory of gun/ basic build videos. If you want to see different build types in use with different weapons
---
Left bumper does it by percent of bar, so I hold that to get close.
---
The 1000 shells that have been sitting in my vendor for a month says no, no they are not.
---
Good point. Let me know if you solve this mystery! I'm sure Bethesda will give you a free month of Fallout 1st! 🤣
---
If the vault raid is broke and your stuck on the take the gold part reset the game and put all the gold you have in your inventory into a stash box then try it. Thats how I fixed mine.
---
It let's me climb the map and get into better hiding places than a Bush!
---
Weight...extra carry weight and nothing else to it
---
Same for armor (and there are free 'paints' now in the run). Great to get the atom challenges done.
---
Great work!  It feels real.
---
I'm with you on that. It would give me some reason to bother with the notes as I've gotten almost everything I wanted already with them
---
Im stuck at an ounce of prevention. My scorch sample disappeared and cant get s new one or finish the quest. Just the main story but like i said its not passable.
---
Awesome! haha
---
I did a double take when I ran into this group of murderers!
---
I use class freak perk card which greatly reduced the side effects. Admittedly I only started using it during the Legendary run. I love it
---
Claim the workshop and move on. They're PvP zones.
---
So far I’ve donated just short of 20k concrete, have 1k left that I’m keeping.   I ran out of concrete one time like a year ago and have picked it up every time I see it no matter what since.   Now would be a sweet time for dupers to redeem themselves.
---
Yeah I wish it wasn't percentage, like bumper changed in increments of 10 and trigger did incremental of 100
---
I don't have a flamethrower trap yet, but I did try blowing it up with a 10mm. When I destroyed it the the gun it leaves a smoking wreck of a machine. Afterward the flooring at least locked into place as green but still wouldn't let me place it saying there was an object there. Does the flamethrower trap completely remove the machine or is the 10mm going to do the same thing?
---
Honestly, i think i wrote on your original post. Run through how you "feel" is vest at the time. Once you hit 50 and it isnt really "right" or you want to test it out different, thats when you start looking at making a proper build. I went through to 50 without checking on anything. Then, I realized i wanted PA heavy. I leveled up on my initial build 12 or 13 times without moving anything, went in, changed all my set points, then as i leveled up i chose new cards completely. Now im running the new build and thinking of changing again. I have now saved 15 level ups to make those changes. 
---
Tldr; dont think so much about it. You'll get there with time.
---
Would the rooms have ghouls in them, since the residents were kicked out of their rooms during the remodeling a year after the bombs fell? Just a thought. Either way, I’m down. The Whitesprings is fascinating!
---
Not only will there be some new currency, there will be a new set of rep grinds. Bethesda really REALLY wants to stretch out the minimal content they release. Atom Shop excluded of course
---
Analyze the sample can be completed. Sample is not in centrifuge and cant gather another.
---
Geez are you not selling them at 1cap? .45,556, and shells never stay in my vendors
---
It just works. I was told that npcs can loot weapons from containers but never seen it myself. Apparently a super mutant really liked a weapon someone was trying to transfer.
---
Christmas presents
---
I'm a Level 100 with 15 PER, but I can't see the gore-covered Fat Man lying in the grass.
---
I dont think a majority of the comments understand the post. OP means INSIDE the fissure. The instant death green pool? Its replaced with the same pool, BUT WITH COLLAPSED ROCKS as the roof. There is no getting out, save for fast travel or dying.
---
And dying, of course, runs the risk of creating a Diavolo death loop, where you die and wake up to just have to die again.
---
What platform
---
Its way earlier. A new break in the quest lol.
---
It's not a very good game, but it's a fallout mmo-lite. If you like playing the vacuum cleaner in Fallout 4, you might like 76.
---
The game couldn't handle vertibird fast travel, I run between locations with a fairly drawn out distance and find myself standing around waiting for the world to load in before I can safely touch anything without repercussions, imagine 20 people doing this at once.. Will never happen~
---
no idea how to get those
---
nukesdragons.com is a great build planner.  Let’s you look through all the different perks and see what a full build would look like.  
---
For a power armor heavy guns build, you’re generally going to max out strength.  Won’t need much perception, maybe three for GlowSight3 now and then.  Endurance can be high or low depending on your need for durability.  Intelligence for Stabilized3, NerdRage3, batteries included, etc, etc, lots here for a heavy guns build.  Agility Adrenaline5, others perks optional for your taste.  Luck StarchedGenes2, ClassFreak3, OneGunArmy3.  
---
Leveling up a PA Heavy is a bit different since you’ll still be taking perk cards well beyond level 50.  Just take what you need to get by for now, while keeping an eye on the specials...don’t want to go overboard on something and have to use level ups later to respec ....that’s not the end of the world, just inconvenient.  
---
At level 14, just use whatever weapons you can. Rifles, shotguns, melee, anything.  Don’t focus too hard on maximizing damage.  You won’t be at a low level for long.   I wouldn’t put too much effort into armor either.  Just keep leveling.  
---
The story pretty much has level ups built into it.  So do the quests.  Also, start working on the Tadpoles and their backpack quest.
---
Second this.
---
If it had a jetpack, deep pocketed and also deep pocketed that I could actually buy and use thennnnnnnn........ Yes
---
Classic. It's almost like this game shouldn't be sold in its current state.
---
God I hope not
---
MOTHMAN OLD ONE CULT (gnomes included) VS BROTHERHOOD OF STEEL
---
Damn i was hoping it would be the gold one it's an easy fix maybe try google and see if there is a work around thats how I learned the gold fix.
---
Can second OP. Its funny at first, but when it happens 5 times in a row and you miss out a queen kill, its frustrating haha
---
Yeah, they really didn't think numbers through well at all.
---
Marsupial will completely change the way you interact with the environment, for the better.  Speed Demon is great too.
---
Granted, this is my build.  ;-)
---

---
Maybe they can finally fix that damn wall.....
---
On the other hand, hardened mass scraps into ultracite 1:1...
---
If the level 100 guy focused on his build, yes, he has a chance. Levels also don't matter after level 50. It comes down to skill and gear.
---
I've taken down level 80+ players on a character under level 50 before. Skill and knowledge of the game (plus not being a fucking foodbuild) also helps tremendously.
---
You can get some pretty good rolls that in vats become death sticks. Provided the server doesn't ignore the damage.
---
All of these should just happen automatically in a loot based game
---
It will definitely come with Faction Reputation that needs to be earned, as for items unlocked I believe bullion will still be the currency.
---
Maybe TD will get you rep, doubt it as that will change the main game removing the turn-in from Camp Venture.
---
I assume Steel Dawn quest line and the daily ops will reward rep. Then down the road potentially expeditions and Fractured Steel quest line for more rep and new content to be unlocked.
---
That would depend on what you enjoy playing I personally love the game. It has its bugs and issues and needs work but it’s an online game that is always changing so take all the issues with a grain of salt and only focus on the new story and if you can immerse yourself into the game it is a lot of fun especially with all the options of character builds I’m not on my third character first 2 were over 200 before I wanted to try something new so if it is on sale I would say pick it up and give it a go I have over 2000 hours in the game and  been playing since beta and compared to beta the game is really good and they are bringing in new content every now and again.
---
Ive heard BoS Collectron collects scrap/ammo/weapons
---
Workaround: Unequip and then re-equip your weapon and the wheel should work again
---
Tried that, no change. Thanks anyway.
---
Not talking about one person dumping it all in, think about how many people have duped junk. I’ve seen posts on here and Facebook of ppl having hundreds of thousands even millions of each type of junk cork included just on xbox. If they each put in a good chunk of Materials on top of all the normal people that are grinding for it we would blow through it no problem and it would barely make a dent in their stash.
---
OP meant inside the green fissure. INSIDE the green scar. Falling in even with power armor, highest rad protection whatever is an INSTANT KILL. And you get spawned in there, with collapsed roofs above you so you cant jump out. Im sure if we respawn in there "by design",  no one would do fights
---
Innovsurvivalist is my favorite because she's the most thorough, IMO.  Turtle's videos seem  geared more toward min maxing and DPS which is not my cup to tea.  I just want an interesting perspective on what's happening with the game. Survivalist foots that bill nicely IMO.  Juice head is okay but he takes a lot of things in stride that really piss me off lol.  He said Bethesda's quake con presentation "confused him."  I thought it was  awful. I think he was too easy on patch 21.  That doesn't mean he has bad content. I think it's quite good actually.
---
I want the candy store to open!!!!!!!!
---
New maps are really needed, nw has potential. But the first thing these goons have to fix is that some people spawn in and loot before others - this is really fucking unfair and stupid 😠 Can't be that hard to make that happen...
---
Yup, all ammo is one cap. Everything else goes except shotty shells and .38/.44
---
Maybe in game fighting between the 3 factions?!?!
---
Hopefully they do it like NV...good on one rep, bad for the other rep
---
They probably have plans to sell a bundle or the items later anyway. The event is just a way to get them for free.
---
Because if i had to guess that collectron is either bad and limited or good and free for a limited time.
---
Yeah he was way too easy on the patch 21 abomination, in my opinion.
---
I liked Johnnie. Shame he commits suicide at the end of the mission. He would have been a good one to keep around, his could have provided some quests based on treachery and deceit. Meg seems like an ineffectual leader. I got betrayed twice by the people under her leadership and was left to clean up the mess myself. If I had the choice I'd off her and put Rocksy in charge. At least she understands the meaning of loyalty.
---
Sell them for 1c or dump them at train stations.
---
Honestly man......idk. its my favorite game I hate and I hate that i love it. Theres some fun areas to it. Locations are cool, the community is extremely welcoming to new players and high level players like to help new people. The quest lines are fun and the addition of npc and factions are great.. The loot system is ok and the game gets really fun around level 25. Its also really buggy and the camp system is ok. Theres not a lot of endgame content and the stash limit is bullshit. It is also extremely monetized. The microtransactions are pretty predatory and the amount of basic shit you have to pay real money for is a turn off, luckily its not pay to win though. 
---
Honestly, if its on sale for $20 of less go for it but keep an open mind. I wouldn't lay more than $20 and I cant whole heartedly recommend it. Its like an addiction I have to come back for. I hate to love it and I love to hate it. Part of it is the massive amount of potential you see on the surface and the hope that eventually you'll log in to see the devs using the potential.......sadly it hasn't happened yet.
---
Stimpaks are only for combat.  Don’t use them for general healing.  Use other aid items for general healing.  
---
Once again, Stimpaks are for the middle of combat when you’re in trouble.  So, no need to carry 100 or those things unless you’re selling them.
---
This is correct. I was thinking at first “wait,
---
I have these on one of my builds and it’s fine”. Then I remembered that it installs backwards, you have to go to the other side of the wall,
---
edit, move the cabinet an inch and presto! It’s flip flopped to the side you originally wanted it on.
---
vale la pena, desgraciadamente no lo tengo, pero vale la pena cada maldito centavo invertido en ese juego y mas si eres fan
---
If you see trash should highlight the meat bags the super mutants use as well. 
---
Pick it up - I personally don’t see any use for it.
---
Lord of the flies - great idea, BUT that would be hell on your weight limits, unless it picks up everything in your immediate vicinity up to your weight cap.
---
But I think that OP wants no backpack at all visible.
---
Oh, they will definitely have their own faction rep. And I'm okay with that, largely. As long as whoever hands out the daily quests isn't a complete drunk like Ward.
---
Did you not notice I replied to someone who wasn't the OP talking about something else before you commented and down voted?
---
Again, the reward had to be valuable enough for them to want to donate. A banner just isn’t one of those things. The only one they might go ham on is the super sale for the purveyor. But most of them have anything they could want so again, unlikely. Even if I had a million concrete I wouldn’t trade in most of it. It would literally be a case of me trying to purchase a banner I don’t like and would never use for a price so outrageously high it would make no sense. And even then there’s no guarantee I would get it because I would still, yet again rely on other people to finish it off. It’s simply not going to happen
---
Blood fued!
---
the only outfits that hide the backpacks do so because they have built in backpacks.
---
I just put a fence around it real close and it keeps me close enough to pick it without being burned.
---
50 isn’t a good enough sample. They’re rare, definitely feels like harder than one in fifty.
---
Its new from the update unfortunately. I can gtind to lvl 20 for the wastelanders quest but its 7 lvls
---
Finally someone to join me at AA meetings...
---
Golf balls, so many golf balls....
---
From dupers, tbqh.
---
Good call... I have a camp on one of my alts at Hemlock Holes too
---
Where do you check that?
---
No i dont actively look for everything that you do on a post? You're not all that important, like why would I? "Ohoho before i respond to this comment, let me look for anything else this guy posted!"
---
The fuck?
---
And yeah sure, i didnt downvote you but sure why the hell not.
---
If you're gonna be a heavy build, go T-65.
---
So i can also use Nuka Cherry in Combat with Cola Nut Perk, they are almost the same speed like a normal Stimpack, still the same speed as a stimpack would heal after 2 Seconds with its Heal over Time.
---
I’ve gotten myself shielded plan two times this month and bought protective one off players vendor for 150 caps. Never gotten the jackpot outfit bundle that I wanted though. So I feel your pain man.
---
So I guess you forgot the whole Free States quest line that happens before the BoS?
---
oh is there an easier way to find them than going to every camp?
---
Ahhhh this makes sense - thanks! I’m a very filthy casual and had no idea there was an in game camera (as well as camera mode!)...

Ok, so if I do the month of subscription and hit a private server and farm resources that end up being well over the 800lb limit, say i end up with 1200 lbs worth. When my sub ends do I lose that extra 400 lbs of resources ?
---
Thank God I'm not the only one. I don't have a sensible reason like you, I just can't decide on which one I like.
---
Stealth commando works great. Stealth heavy (with an explosive flamer and lots of repair kits) burns him down in 10 minutes. Not sure if one gun army works on those sacs, but id like to find out!
---
That is fantastic.
---
I'm not 100% sure if I wanna switch just yet... though my rifleman build sucks I think I just need to get a bloodied rifle and itll be better
---
SteelCoin. Ad capitalism!
---
Yeah, if you're gonna do rifles though go commando. So much more damage.
---
I can help you with the revives one tomorrow if you dont find someone else
---
I’ve not really played with the Cola Nut perk recently , so I’m not qualified to say.  In fact, I assumed you were a new-ish player having trouble keeping up with stimpaks.  My bad, sorry.  
---
About a year ago I was into using Nuka Cola a lot but honestly I’ve moved away from it and can’t recall.
---
Yah, that’s what I was referring to when I mentioned broken. Shotguns and heavy guns seems to have a lot of effects that were much stronger than intended
---
Welcome to the end game. Please visit the Atom Shop for daily specials...
---
Look at my recent post about creating a new way for people to interact competitively. People generally leave me alone at workshops tho, not that I care much these days as any junk I am carrying is trivial.
---
You gave me a want that i cant have
---
Not so fun once they start demanding an admiralty court and blathering about flag fringes.
---
Try using the 'tab' key to see if it highlights the options.
---
that'd be awesome, what timezone are you in? :)
---
Really? I always thought since it was automatic it did way less, also it chews through ammo to fast for me, any tips for that? Thanks btw
---
I'm in now and will let you kill me as many times as you want, I even have a private world we can do it in.  Only thing I ask is you let me do the same because I need those trophies too.
---
You sell the Marine Tactical Helmet plan for 3k? Man, I had my extra up for 400. I love that thing. Trip to Grafton High every once in awhile and it's 1800K every day.
---
Yea that’s exactly what I was referring to, the scary part is that we can kill super mutants but we can’t kill our allies or friendly NPCs to get it back, so when they grab our stuff we’re sol
---
The next time I’ll be online is in 13-14 hours and I’ll stay on for 6+ hours from that time
---
I personally would use the Strangler over the T65 because of the Poison Damage + Looks Great with the Raider Marauder Skin.
---
lbr, everything in that bundle was worth it. i love the icon, personally. and the emote. and the throne. and the outfit. one of the best bundles imo. but the throne is also kinda fucked, it clips through ceilings if you put it on the 2nd floor of a camp. i already asked for my refund. would suggest everyone do the same. it‘s the only way they learn.
---
Nope, it's got way way higher DPS. For ammo consumption, go stealth commando and shoot in bursts of 3-4.
---
I have a level 100+ character that wears leather. Lightweight and good for stealth. More comfortable than Combat Armor too. :)
---
ask for a refund.
---
If you’ve built the bar he’ll show up eventually.
---
Jet pack  away with psycho buff on.
---
I would say it's probably a step too far. I'm generally not a fan of YT shows that read reddit to me
---
yes. ask for a refund.
---
When you mentioned a can't boss fight on the green my first thought was an enormous bloated ghoul that just looks like Tetsuo from Akira and the whole fight is just us plinking away at that fatlard between waves of fleshy destruction, but then I thought the Strangler vines would give a better Tetsuo feel and now I want that Nuke Boss in the Mire. Have one of the rewards be a dope ass cyberpunk jacket and a motorcycle CAMP decoration.
---
For real. There's actually a lot of events but only like 4 worth the time to do
---
I was trying to get some vanguards pieces too and wound up getting a few unyielding instead. Would have been exciting if I were bloodied.
---
I have a completely random set of SS armor now but itll do. Ran out of stash space for the rejects
---
Yeah! what's your Username?
---
Please, my rabbits need better things to drive than racecar beds.
---
Pretty much eh, I usually hop into another one but sometimes it happens in the middle of the challenge I need to finish.
---
Laughs in emergency protoco...
---
Wait, I’m not a bloodied build
---
Oh geez, nice of them to do that.
---
The poison damage is hardly noticable since they nerfed. Only reason I would Strangler over T-65 is if you the jetpack on on the arm pieces so then you can have another torso mod.
---
If you’re in a difficult area, say, SENECA ROCKS, he ain’t going up there. From personal experience.
---
Less than 5M on the first day. RIP.
---
They should do a server vote to choose from 3 or 4 events and still have a few randoms to keep a rotation.
---
No, you can get that, too, but it's called Pioneer Scout Possum Shorts, not uniform.
---
It's in the same vendor, right next to the skirt.
---
"More broken vehicles? Ok next vehicle is going to invert your camp budget and as long as it's placed will keep it negative" - Bethesda
---
The future is here and it’s called dailies. That’s the only time I play it, as soon as I get the score I drop the assaultron head and log off.
---
Get the Secret Service armor, it can drop from events once you know the plans, so it's prolly the prime first grab after the guns so you get a chance for it to drop for free while you grind up the get the rest.
---
I believe this is the story of almost everyone crafting SS armor. There are just too many possibilities in a RNG environment. Very time consuming to get the set you want, probably by design.
---
Dont blame the failures on "boycotters". I can guarantee you there arent enough out of the player base actively boycotting it to make squat of difference. Even if everyone was working on it it still will likely fail simply because the target is set without any regard for the actual limited number of ways to obtain these materials, or for the fact the respawns are time gated. Even if everyone on the server was actively out look for concrete, you would all be competing for the same limited spawns and finding them already looted.
---
This is on Bethesda for not even understanding the limits of their own game
---
They have to put their tent in just the right place.
---
Edit: Putting the tent in the right place makes the scorched spawn in the middle. If the person had an explosive flamer and good connection it might explain them all dying (you can kill the scorched when they spawn in the air, before they fall), but I've never seen it consistently happen.
---
No keys seem to do anything except scroll the text. We've tried them all! Thanks anyway.
---
Doesn’t work when your armor prevents you from being overweight
---
Yea. Few worthwhile events on top of each server having maybe 1-3 going at a time. Feels like there’s just nothing to do but server hop way too much.
---
You can literally see with no extra effort, that I responded to someone else. The line next to a comment, the one you'll see next to this comment, goes up to who I replied to. If there is no line, then they're not responding to a comment. 
---
You don't need to look up everything I've ever responded to. You just need to know how reddit works to see I wasn't responding to the OP.
---
No, im not a new player, i have no problems with Stimpacks, but its a new way maybe to use stuff like that to heal with this perk, it also gives 45% Water, thats not bad. Im mainly now using Nuka Cherry and try a bit in combat etc.
---
Or have a luck perk called Flower Power and have a bunch of brightly colored flowers burst out of the meat piles 3 feet high.
---
Tonight a lvl 68 pushed me away from the terminal to start it. It was at 8:50 left.
---
I run with a group who can take a sbq out in sub 1 min. We let it go for ten to 15 to make sure every one gets damage. I run cryolators because it lets everyone's shot hit in air and slows the piss from coming.
---
I launch 3 nukes and a encrypted, and a riding shotgun every time, then 4 to 6 others do it progressing on servers threw the night. 
---
Xbox 
---
It's fun, and just annoying that some are either entitled or won't wait.
---
Mordortek is my handle if anyone has some nuke cards, I'm out
---
And then like most of the events are so bad...like battle bots it's barely even a event lol
---
Cork will be even worse because cork doesnt even have the option to use extractors at workstations
---
For the sake of the landing pad clinging to the top of Seneca Rock I currently have, yes please
---
&gt;the amount of basic shit you have to pay real money for is a turn off
---
Give an example? Because you dont have to pay, you can earn atoms.
---
god the same thing happened at carleton mine, i couldnt progess that quest for a few days, which is really damn annoying. eventually it happened but god i wish this game wasnt so broken at times.
---
You wouldn’t have to trade most of it 30k out of a million isn’t much but yeah your right most people wouldn’t do that if there wasn’t anything to gain for them self’s. I’m just have a different mind set, if I had millions of junk items I’d give enough to help out. A million cork or steel even concrete would last you a long time..I guess I look at it as helping everyone gain something. I just couldn’t sit there while I have enough materials for 50 characters to be set for awhile and not help out. I would have more sense of pride putting a big chunk of what I have towards a goal for everyone then trading 500,000 steel for a guns. That’s just me
---
Yeah lol but nah he was already at my camp while I was doing his quests. After the last one he disappeared
---
Good to know. I don’t have enough for even one turn in.
---
I finally looked at the "goals" just now and am pretty shocked at how ridiculously obsurd they are. From what I've seen in various posts, I'd agree that whoever chose the numbers clearly don't play the game. 
---
Lets be real, anyone without Fo1st most likely won't donate too much since, with limited storage space, won't have massive stockpiles of material. Cement and cork are two materials that people use very little of so it's not like anyone holds onto them much. Both cement and cork are significantly harder to obtain than steel so why have a higher goal for both?
---
... fly swatter
---
Who doesn't love Barry &amp; Levon? I also love the Leonard Harris show.
---
The water level tho... Nightmares.
---
The problem with concrete is its heavy and its not used in anything other than CAMP building. So if you are a player like me who builds and stays put for lengthy periods of time then you have no real reason to collect it in the first place. Even if you are a player who likes to build a lot, you are probably going to want to hang onto most of what you do collect. Having fallout 1st isnt a guarantee of people having vast lots of concrete at their disposal. Its not like the steel or other resources that come as a by product of scrapping.
---
I did donate what I could but i very recently rebuilt my CAMP so a lot of what I did have stockpiled before this was used in building
---
It's too bad you can't move your camp to a different resource node without losing the ability to rebuild it the same way.
---
Damn, there were some straight up MVPs posting today... Thank you so much for your work!
---
I’ve got my own tactic, I think the easiest one. You just need to learn the marine tactical helmet plan (you can find it in a wagon west from watoga station, like 150 meters, just server hop a few times, also there other places) learn it, equip maxed super duper perk and just make a lot of those, they’re very cheap in terms of resources. Than just sell it all to vendor and you’re good, no need for going around picking garbage to sell.
---
A pampered lvl 50 mule designed for PvP can demolish any player. You can have other characters crafting and modding for him, giving him plans and serums, perfect gear, buffs and Quantum, etc. 
---
Some perks won't be perfect, but that wouldn't make such a big difference.
---
I tried it, it works.
---
Same here. I'm not donating any plastic when it feels like I'm constantly low because I'm a shotgunner. I use my fancy shotty 90% of the time. 
---
They're more than welcome to all the cloth I have in my scrapbox though.
---
Amen
---
Scrap it and rebuild it
---
Awesome thanks, really appreciate the help!
---
Always Lode Bearing and Free Range... no one gives a shit about those
---
I'm throwing in a couple sets of 250 when I can. But honestly, I'm burnt out at this point.
---
I log in for 20-30 mins a day to do my daily challenges, and that's about it. I keep 200 concrete in my stash, any excess I donate when I can.
---
But, tbh... Not feeling much motivation to do this event.
---
If they added requisitions that count as 250 scrap to BoS specific events (like Line in the Sand or Heart of the Enemy) to make the grind more interesting, I think a lot more would participate.
---
If you’re in an accessible area you can just scrap his bar, build a different Ally space, scrap that and rebuild Beckett. It’s the IT equivalent of “turning it off and turning it on again”. You might even want to server hop between scrappings.
---
Again, if you’re in a hard to reach location this is just a temporary fix. Good luck!
---
I want a honey beast colossus or honey beast nuke boss
---
Can finish before the announcement is over lol
---
Oh that's cool, thanks!
---
No problem, I hope you enjoy your new build :D
---
I get that mentality, but the fact is the goal is too damn high. Bethesda either doesn’t understand how the game works or genuinely thought people would be  more into it than they are. Even with everyone turning it in, cork and concrete just aren’t that easily obtainable in the numbers asked of us. Things like Leather or Cloth will be attainable because they are easy to obtain. Steel was SUPER easy. You can help out all you want. It doesn’t change the fact it’s just not obtainable at those numbers. The fact that Steel was lower than cork or concrete should tell you they don’t understand how common or rare certain materials are
---
Workshops are always PvP. 
---
Stay crouched to remain hidden on the map from other players
---
You can almost always get resources faster in the world than by using workshops. 
---
My camp budget is 100% filled. For the build camp/workshop stuff I fast-travel, crouch, kill as needed, claim, build, and go away. 99% of my workshop claims I never use the resources.
---
Issue with concrete:It weighs too much even bulk. Each packet drop needs 25 bulk. The concrete requires you to server hop to find it  as it isnt an easy to find item. The rewards given from the botherhood are flat out crap. Yes you may get a plan. You get some caps nothing to write home about. Issue in general asking say FO1st to dive into their stash isnt fair for many reasons.
---
What basic shit do you have to pay real money for? Are you complaining there are a lot of camp items and outfits or am I missing something?
---
Maybe you need some mods to fix your weight issue, or perks to be corrected. I carry 6 heavy weapons and have 350 carry in my t60 armor, 290 out of it.
---
*Bethesda loves this post*
---
No way in hell, those numbers are impossible with boe much a playera has to go through just to get less then 100
---
I don’t see that happening.
---
Theres a beret, a new collectron, the banner (which actually looks really cool), and another reward i believe.
---
Nope, you can still deposit junk from scrap box, just not putting in.
---
Dale para adelante papá
---
I’m wondering that as well.
---
Chameleon will give you 40 DR which is detrimental to berserker builds.  Which might as well be no adverse affects because nobody does berserker builds.
---
Don’t try to be the voice of reason or employ rational thought on social media.  The overwhelming majority are looking to join a circle jerk that suits some crazy or petulant agenda.
---
Oh my god thank you! This was driving me insane ✌🏼
---
Thats fair, for example though cinder block walls. Really? Like......and its not even actually walls its wallpaper that I can't even put on the outside of walls, at that costs money. Theres just so many camp items that shouldn't cost because its basic stuff that was standard in fo4. Potted plants, secret service underarmor, deferent styles of building themes. Like.....so much of that would have been standard in a non mmo and they are charging all that while not updating shit. It feels like they have tome to add shit to the atom store but don't have time to fix bugs or give us some solid quest additions. And the community building supply thing going on rn is a joke. It wouldn't be as annoying if they would have given us a finished game and would listen to what players want instead of intersecting extra bullshit that no one askes for. People wants changes to the ammo converter, weekly atom challenges, higher storage, more camp budget and less currency caps. What do we get? A bullshit community challenge where you can win a flag and hat and zero bug fixes. Oh but you can buy a monthly subscription to have unlimited stash storage that should be free to everyone.
---
 ?? Are you saying you can’t craft anything other than leather? I assume you get metal at least from the main quest. But honestly, your best armor you’ll just loot off enemies.
---
It IS an alternate timeline
---
You can get 4 bags in Blackwater Mine in the room Uranium Fever takes place in.  Breaks down to 28 scrap.
---
Monorail Elevator has a bunch too.
---
*Cries in 7months of turn ins and only the first two plans*
---
Oh okay, the collection holds a fair bit of value if its collection options are useful!
---
Because it's more difficult to hunt a man with a sickle.
---
Till they request to sleep in all ur beds
---
I've been able to get them a few times that way, and occasionally if I look around the ground by their feet I can find a hit box and loot it.
---
Opening provision boxes to only get chems and purified water doesn't entice me to donate.  Opened 4 with steel only got plans that I already had and another 4 with the concrete and didn't get any plans at all.  I won't bother anymore.  It's not worth my time. The BoS is coming regardless of us making those goals.
---
What is the goal for cork?
---
I had like 300 stored away, you're right. I am a 1st player but it's not about storage it's about how much i've ever needed plus how difficult it is to acquire the materials.  
---
Even then the items that you need to collect concrete are few and far between, people just don't want to search around for such shitty rewards. I want the banner also but even a bag of cement only gives me 7 and any location that has them it's onlya  handful. I am not spending HOURS in this game hunting around to find 250 concrete.  
---
I want the banner but lets be honest they're about to release a BoS update which will probably have a shit ton of brotherhood cosmetics. I'd rather a flag than the banner.
---
Someone doesn't understand the magic guns
---
that sounds really easy, how much do they sell for?
---
200 million. Compare that to the 150 million asked of concrete or 125 million of steel
---
Ok cool
---
That is definitely turning lemons into lemon grenades!
---
I spawned on the edge and looked for crates near the edge. Hoped to get 1 stimpak. You can stand outside for around 45 seconds before you die. If you get one stimpak you can run back in and heal then run out again for the final 15
---
If you enjoy Fallout games, yes, buy it. Even if all you do are the quest lines, you'll get your money's worth.
---
Out of 3 steel donations, I got 2 plans - mole miner &amp; laser gun. Rest was alcohol and a few caps.
---
Deep pocketed SS limbs. That's what I want
---
33-35 caps each as far as I remember, you need like 1 plastic, 2 leather and 1 of something else to make it, and with super duper perk it’s easily the best option I could think of for making caps.
---
Yes, just start in an area you know you’ll find aid items, 2-3 stims should do the job.  Then wait for the fire or run to it.
---
I get better drops from the purveyor. Got my set of secret service armor that way. Settler wander gave me a tse lmg today.
---
Find a couple stims. Go in and lose 75% health. Pop out. Stim. Wait for health to regen. Repeat.
---
I used a stimpak and a diluted one and I got the the challenge. I also used lifegiver and had wood armor on.
---
mk on my way to watoga station rn, thank you
---
Well obviously but thats not even remotely close to being an atom shop item, its supposed to be a reward, they simply couldn't make it claimable at the deposit crate? Then you go about your day donating concrete, seems like they didn't even have the damn thing made when they started this whole thing
---
Yeah, Bethesda should change it, but that's no excuse for people to be selfish jerks. Blaming Bethesda for that is nonsense.
---
the rewards suck tbh, im lvl 450 i dont need some water and 20 ammo
---
I already have pioneer scout possum shorts though - row 198. Pioneer scout possum uniform is in the game files but not legitimately available
---
+1
---
None of the devs play the game. That is the reason every update is littered with bugs.
---
Not yet. You can get in 51 in nuclear winter.
---
That makes me sad. Savage divide events. Does that include evclave events that take place in senneca rocks visitors center?
---
Random event while you're there: off in the distance you just see a robed figure with a sickle staring you down as you. Look back. Then you turn around for just a split second and it's gone
---
There are videos on YouTube on how to find all marine armor plans, you might wanna check them, cause there are other places to find this plan, if you won’t get lucky with watoga station.
---
Rng has always been in the game just crafting for non tradable items makes it same worse
---
Imagine getting downvoted for speaking the truth. I got -19 downvotes because of the toddlings
---
I wasn't optimistic even before concrete donating started, barely collected to 500 today (and i already had 200 on me before i made 2 circles around the map) then I went to f76 website to see updated amount of donated concrete, and sure i wasn't surprised to see under 5M donated.
---
Whomever came up with concrete and cork numbers clearly had no idea about what kind of materials are those and where and how much we use them.
---
Concrete obviously for building but in my experience 75% of camps i come across are made of wood, and from a tip of my head i could only recall couple of armor upgrades that require cork.
---
20M of both cork and concrete would be way more acheiveable numbers  for donation and as many ppl said here it's so stupid that we have to donate materials in fixed quontities.
---
The beta wasn’t this bad.
---
I'll fucking cry
---
Oh wow holy shit all right I get your point now I thought it was the same steel I haven’t been on damn. That is quite ridiculous but I guarantee even if we don’t make it we will somehow end up getting the banner because they will look back and realize how ridiculous that goal is and how rare cork is to get I’ve been playing pretty much since Petah and I only have 5 K Cork. Honestly I don’t even know what it’s used in her used for I might’ve had more but like I said I might’ve crafted stuff with it
---
I wouldn't be so sure about new players benefitting that much, they're still at the mercy of the crap RNG and crappier rewards. I took my 'new' character over there the other day to try to get a plan with a steel donation, and just got a bunch of alcohol and no plans that would've been useful for that LVL 7 character.
---
Yes but not if its a public team.
---
I have the ideal Unyielding, Assassin's and Vanguard's sets of armor in Heavy Combat, Marine and Heavy leather (eight sets total, five characters). They are fantastic. 
---
I just want a decent, solid set of Secret Service. Maybe Vanguard, maybe Unyielding, maybe Troubleshooters... Range is too crazy and I imagine it would stop being fun to craft daily considering you can't scrip them back with the 150 daily limit.
---
This happens to me about once every two days on the first login after the day's stuff (challenges etc) are reset, so after 10am Mountain time. If you notice that it is showing you at level 1 SCORE, and go into SCORE from the Esc/map menu, it'll recognize your true SCORE position and not go through multiple (in my case 72) levels one at a time.
---
The worse part is when it says you have leveled up and press Esc to claim that nonexistent reward, that will impede your progress doing whatever else you're trying to do - if you try to hit Esc to leave a workbench, it'll dump you into the SCORE board.
---
Just googled the grill and found this.. thank you so much for the info!
---
I understand, but just because a game allows a person to act like a jerk that doesn't make them not a jerk. I'm saying stop blaming Bethesda for players being selfish.
---
This is happening to me also right now. Can’t continue main quest
---
Is the server down for anyone else? Me and my brother can't seem to log in (Steam). Says Vault Tek engineers are hard at work to fix the servers. Is that real, or just something on our end?

---
*Psst equip a piece of armor with reduced damage while blocking by 15*
---
It will make that gun magic and destroy everything.
---
Perhaps. Three of my legendary armor pieces reduce weapons weight by 20%, all my armor is deep pocketed (and I’ve got the chemist backpack mod and the shielded secret service armor, which increases strength by 4, and it’s already at 13). I have 360 carry weight in all my gear, but when I put on the Chinese stealth armor or power armor, the weight of all my stuff (with Bear Arms at 2, rank 1 of Strong Back, Rank 1 of Trough Hiker, rank 2 of Scattershot) shoots up into the 700s.
---
I survived for more than 2 minutes but didn't get the score.
---
I donated 250 steel and got some booze and radaway. I don't plan on donating anything else because of that.
---
Oh yea like the patch note about the fix of the reactor room wallbreach or the art fix on the frame changed from a laser musket over too a pipe rifle? I think its you who didn't read the patch notes, no mention of it being an atomic shop item... you are either blind or ignorant.
---
quit cold turkey. move on with your life
---
Do people honestly hunt the hats down? Is it just the hats? How much do they go for?
---
I'm not collecting them myself, but I'm happy to stock my vendor with them at a reasonable price if it's a big enough sort of thing...
---
I have been installing as many fireplaces as I can in my camp...
---
Is this a proven fact? I usually bulk all my junk immediately so hearing that it’s pointless kinda bums me out.
---
Same damn thing is going to happen with the cork but worse, like I've been saying
---
Yeah honestly I just don't do Encryptid anymore due to the wasted resources and time. I've only been able to do two successful events for this and the rest were trashed by people that didn't follow the quest markers, even though they were level 150+ and had to have figured out how to be useful by now. The last two had just me and one other player among 8 who bothered with the pylons. The rest attacked a cloaked sheepsquatch. Morons

I have fallout first - so space is a non issue for me.  I collect everything;  it's just the way I play fallout.  
---
I had 60k steel.  I donated that all - and have already (thanks to west-tek) farmed another 40k.  
---
Concrete?  1500.
---
*Awaits cosmetics to appear anyway*
---
Er, they have hired modders. And continue to pay dozens of em

That’d be pretty awesome. Maybe use a Skyrim-esque room customization system as a cap dump for high level players.
---
Bloodied isn’t the only thing people look for. I love my Vampires Tesla for shredding ghoul packs, and other hordes.
---
You should have plenty of time.  We are only half way through the season.
---
While the game is still bugged to fuck and the devs still release patches without actually testing them to see if they work ive actually been putting alot of hours into it as of late i even met a few new friends which you need if you want to do anything also the random people i meet on my travels are generous asf i wouldn’t of survived without them but im only playing for a couple months until Mafia D.E drops so im really giving it a fair shake
---
Pff i want a plan for nuka cola grape
---
yeah didnt find the wagon, I'll try youtube
---
Enclave strong
---
Sounds like you likely have a lot of chems on you. Only thing i can think of that would do that. Everything you wrote except chemist back pack effects the right side(total weight). While the chemist back pack effects the left side (current weight). So if you change a perk to have the chemist effect, it would likely keep you stable in and out of PA, but not sure of the side effect for your current build. 
---
Honestly, my first instinct is to say that you have too many drugs on you and they should be sold or traded. That is obviously from my view and i keep a few stimpack(10) and radaway(10) on me and sell basically all other drugs to the vendor as i dont use them.
---
I have the same issue with that quest right now.  Apparently Bethesda is working on it, but how there is a bug as common as this appears to be in a main quest is beyond me.
---
Thank you, I feel a little bit safer moving my camp tonight now.
---
My over 300 had less than 200 concrete.  I don't pick up gnomes or bags generally so that is how many lead pipes I broke down minus whatever I spent making my CAMP foundations, stairs etc.
---
Yeah kinda, I mean I did point out its not pay to win so none of it is required. The atom shop just seems idk, over done. I get charging money for pre constructed stuff like the cabin or the glass igloo thing but charging for nicer wood floors or cinder block walls is shitty, especially when it doesn't show cinder block on the outside, only inside. And paying a subscription to take a storage cap away is a garbage.
---
yeah absolutely ridiculous, wouldnt be hard to add a 3 star boss in at 50% prep and another 3 star sentry bot at 100%. At the moment killing afew gutsy's is just a chore.
---
Funny enough, I don't use them myself. I do know they cost 20 energy each though. Found a guy who had them at his camp, snuck in and changed them to producing .38 ammo...
---
no shit you'd need to run a private server. fucking obviously.  and what's wrong with that?
---
Lonely island....haha
---
Ok baby I’m coming back right now
---
All at once? I got it after I did a full minute all at once
---
Well, I’d donate if the ATLAS Donor boxes weren’t so garbage. During the steel event I literally got about three kegs worth of beer, a few stimpaks, and a T-51b power armor plan for 2k steel. And steel is the easiest resource on there to get. Concrete is something you have to deliberately go out looking for or farm out of a workshop.
---
Her der, I game worthless stuff I get thousands of at events and got some mildly useful stuff, her der, me no do that again, her der, me too smart!
---
I agree with this so much, and I just realized the reasons we can't put clothes over the stealth suit are the same two reasons they changed the hazmat from beta so that we can't wear clothes over that either: 1) rad damage of all kinds would be entirely trivialized and 2) players in pvp scenarios using the rad gun would have no idea why it wasn't working. 
---
No. 1 is a legit mechanics concern, and I say that as someone who hates hates hates rad damage and wears the stealth suit exclusively for the rad resist (and armor). Also f*ck lvl 68 charred feral ghouls.
---
No. 2 strikes me as more theoretical since idk how many pvpers use rad guns, but I can see how with the stealth suit and the hazmat suit this would be the *one* situation where aesthetic obfuscation matters. Then again, I'm not sure if NW mode allows for aesthetic outfits so the PVP implications of this would be really really minimal.
---
Your character is saved on their servers. You just need to use the same login and he/she should still be there. I'm not sure why other people are saying otherwise.
---
Use nukacrypt or roguetrader for knowing what items are worth. It helps a lot. It also will tell you if its magic or god tier.
---
Tbf I almost crapped my pants when I accidentaly looted random gnome and it made laughing noise
---
vault 94 raid wasnt meeting bethesda's standards (let that statement sink in) so they removed it. they said they plan to rework it and re-add it one day, along with the 96 and 63 raids. many suspect the "daily ops" on the roadmap are these raids.
---
vault 51's interior is accessable in the nuclear winter mode's pre-game lobbies, but you only have like 3 minutes to explore it so if you're looking for lore i'd just watch an oxhorn video or something.
---
and of course breaking into vault 79 is the main point of the wastelanders questline, so you do get to enter that one.

A beautify the Wasteland event would be super fun. Find little things and fix them or have an event permanently clear an area so our faction of choice can use it. There’s so many cool ideas that are inherit to a MMO Fallout could utilize that Bethesda has just completely glossed over.
---
Hmm. I’m not really running a build other then heavy weapons, but yeah, I think I may have too many drugs. I’ve got 200 Stimpacks, 110 Radaway, 88 Rad-X, 18 Grape Mentats, 38 Disease Cures, 35 Buffout, 20 Antibiotics, and 11 Addictol. 
---
...off to sell some stims!
---
Don't care about any of the rewards but I'm happy to dump garbage on BoS so other people have more variety when they dress their virtual dollies up.  But I'm not going to spend hours farming a few hundred concrete.  Steel at least drops by the ton at events.
---
New account, no karma, no posts or comments beside this one, yeah I’m pretty sure the gals will come running for you
---
I donated at least 20k steel and got jackshit out of the reward crates. Why bother personally farming these resources when you don't get anything?
---
I'll likely be trying a bloodied heavy Vampire's build with my magic minigun, at least once the event is added.
---
I've taken out the one currently in the game solo several times.
---
Honey Beast is the unsung best addition. A massive boss version would be sick.
---
I logged on and realized I only have 52 concrete lmao. It’s something I don’t often come by and something I don’t really use. That’s why it usually is one of the first things I drop when low on stash space
---
Hate to say it, but get Fo1st, everything but the survival tent and scrap box is pretty useless. The scrap box gives you Infinite storage space for scrap items only, when goes out of it's way to scrap the items too. The survival tent gives you access the both the stash and scrap box aswell as a bed, cooking pot, and instrument that can you move around for absolutely nothing. Oh, you also get 1650 atoms a month. All for 13 dollars a month.
---
Unrelated but I've never seen so many actual female players in any game before. No idea why
---
I would like it a lot better if they'd make it more user friendly. Plus as someone who's low level in it it really sucks to get blasted by a level 90 with all the perk cards. Plus my adventure mode characters aren't set up for NW.
---
God i hope not
---
Brilliant! Thank you so much for your effort!    
---
I have a bunch of clothing items in my inventory and no clue as to **how entirely common and worthless they were.** Now I can be free of them.
---
Yup, my two new favorite creatures were the Mega Sloth and Honey Beast
---
Bruv.....yeah, theres the weight issue. See what you need in a run, figure out how often you pick up, then extrapolate from there what you NEED on you. Thats why i only carry 10 each, if you use stuff, keep it on you, but that sounds like a stash not an on person build. 
---
Also, im running heavy PA build, so we should be fairly similar depending on what kinds of heavies you use (junkies, bloodied).
---
Are you on ps4? I don’t have a two shot lever but I have a 3 star explosive I might be willing to trade for another gun.

---
Kill the whole “going through the silo” let us just be able to activate launch prep THEN bring in the sentry /Assultron bots at 75% 
---
Give us the ammo we actually dumped into the event as a reward
---
Oh sorry this might be asking for too much
---
Yes, it was all at once and I spawned 3 feet from the fire line.
---
Maybe it started the clock during the loading screen or something.
---
Earlier, in adventure mode, I killed three legendary enemies but only got credit for one. I guess legendary scorchbeasts didn't count for today's SCORE(?) or it is just being buggy. 
---
I tried nw again but this time grabbed some more stimpacks so I could survive longer. While in the irradiated some, I mutated to chameleon. If I cared about playing nw, that would have been a great way to start the game, but I quit after I got the SCORE, like always.
---
So, basically the Raider and regular Collectrons combined.
---
That's great to here, I've been following it's progression and thought why not give it a try, I've also heard it got better with wastelanders and with the new content that might come out this year it's worth it, especially if its on sale
---
I think they should refer to another MMO (I think of 76 as an MMO-lite) in their parent company's wheelhouse: ESO. There is a shared bank, and there is a limit on how many items (not weight!) it can hold, upgradeable with in-game gold. The Scrapbox is a very similar concept to the Crafting Bag, so I don't see why they couldn't change stash to being based on number of unique items/stacks. Hell, if they want to add a bank that you have to go to set locations to use and keep the stash as per character storage, I'd fully support it. I have friends that play 76, but nowhere near as frequently as I do. Even with private worlds, it's a pain to transfer anything to my alts. I love this game, but this, to me, is the most obnoxious feature in 76. We need some sort of shared storage, even if we have to pay caps to upgrade it.
---
7 concrete per bag.  That would be 15,000 bags.  That's 41 bags per day for a year or going to about 8 specific places with bags just to get bags.  Every day.  For a year.
---
Your friends are dupers.
---
Purified water is the easiest. Place as many as you can in your camp. Each one sells for about 5 caps at high enough charisma. That's only 280 water a day (which isn't a lot)

Fallout 76 have a fair share of female players, I don’t encounter that many but I still see players with female names from time to time.

If there’s one game that truly has a massive amount of female players, it would be overwatch

---
After weeks of grinding everyday for the dailies, I just have zero desire to play anymore once I finish those challenges. I am like Level 81 now or something and I've stopped doing the dailies every single day. I much rather play The Witcher 3 which this is my first playthrough so it's much more enjoyable.
---
These challenges likely to not finish and not even close should send a message to Bethesda. The grind for everything is just way too much and we're burnt out. The rewards aren't even remotely worth it either. They should hopefully get the message of stop making everything such a grind.
---
Wouldn't it be funny though, if we don't complete it they delay the BOS story add on in the Winter? I mean honestly it's gonna be delayed anyway, after Wastelanders, I seriously doubt we get that big questline this year.
---
Op just was asking how to do it without looking up the codes....
---
I think they were trying to clear out dupers’ stashes, but also do it in a less obvious way. Clearly, this event isn’t beneficial for anyone playing legitimately. You get a bottle of wine and a grenade or two for a few hours of workshop scrap collection. This clearly wasn’t thought through.
---
Thank you very much, that got me down to only two trophies needed for platinum.

---
Ooh FannyBags.
---
They will auto complete it  lol that what they said
---
Yeah ntm to keep it simple prolly means it still qualifies as beta? If they were to add more modes/variation, maybe it wouldn't exactly be qualified as beta anymore
---
When the event was announced I checked my stash for respective allotments of trash to donate.  Being well aware of how much time I spend hauling materials I could never possibly use - your hoard is outrageous. hahah
---
Don't forget to equip Hard Bargain. Grape meats help as well  Selling surplus ammo (5.56 especiall - I alwaystry to keep at least 2000 in my vending machine) has prevented my character from foing bankrupt.
---
Yeah that’s true. And while we are on that topic I notice that the fallout community is the gaming community with the least amount of kids/early teenagers. After being part of communities filled with young people, being a part of the 76 community and encountering adults mostly is a breath of fresh air
---
And here I am trying to get my husband to come back to this game...or at least he can give me all his good gear. 😅😅😅 He obviously said no! At least I tried. 🤣
---
Seriously 
---
I wanna walk around and get SMOKED by a level 300 liberator lmao
---
There's really two end results:
---
Bethesda auto-completes it, with a comical jump on the last day, and Bethesda realizes they have set unrealistic goals (or they don't).
---
Bethesda doesn't auto-complete it, we miss out on a Tire holding a metal pole with a Fancy symbol on it, and Bethesda realizes they have set unrealistic goals (or they don't).
---
Do they have infinite ammo?  🤔 I have to get my first settler.      Though I read you can only have one active settler at a time.
---
I experienced a glitch when I left NW and went to adventure my characters shotty  was like clipping and I couldn't holster it. It was like I had the gun with visual glitch but my character was in the unarmed stance.
---
*It’s not Fallout 2.* /s
---
I just started playing the fallout series when fallout 4 came out.  I didn't think I was ever in to RPG games but I loved it then I got New Vegas fallout 3, skyrim I played through those like six or seven times this one's just a joke I tried and tried but can't do it anymore.
---
Dicks out for Harambe.
---
As opposed to the passive-aggressive whining I get every time I visit the Settlers, and someone complains that because I used a Radaway an hour ago, I just *reek* of chems and need to go take a nap.
---
True. Just helps to ask lol
---
I doubt they will. The Poseidon Oil Rig cut off comms with the bunker during the Great War
---
I don't get why they removed "the battle that never was" event from priketts fort =/
---
Ah. I like to keep some for emergencies, but at this point I think I’ve gone overboard! Just sold a bunch of em. 
---
And I’m running;
---
Anti-Armor Gatling Plasma
---
Final Word
---
Furious Light Machine Gun (also faster speed while aiming and 50% better VATS crits)
---
Vampires Ultracite Gatling Laser (33% VATS hit chance, faster movement while aiming)
---
Vampires Minigun 
---
Vampires Gatling Gun (50 DR while aiming, 50% better VATS crits)
---
Vampires Automatic Assault Rifle (33% VATS hit chance, 50 DR while aiming)
---
And a Vampires Tesla Rifle (with 33% VATS hit chance)
---
The heftier weapons are for tougher targets, Tesla is for crowds, and the Gatling or Assault Rifle are for average targets.
---
I trust that either a very small but dedicated group of people will grind this out or Bethesda will edit future goals
---
I’m with you on this.  Rocksy is the kind of no-nonsense, community-first leader I could get behind in the Fallout universe.
---
Do it fast my guess they are going to be “fixing” camp exploits since the double walls
---
I managed a full set with less than that. I've also gotten 4 pies from the machine.
---
But don't worry, the queen loves to drop me one star nocturnals...like....every fucking time.
---
Lol yea, it was first thing I checked after reading the camp fixes in the patch notes
---
I doubt they will, they didn’t leave the Oil Rig when the BOS was fighting off the masters army, which was the greatest threat the post war humans faced, so why would they follow a tiny recon team from some soldiers hiding in a bunker
---
DR over 300 kind of becomes insignificant it seems. Was a Vanguard's myself up until about a month ago.
---
Oh my bad I have no idea lol
---
Lode Bearing is perfectly named though. Click the button to open the mine then afk and go to the bathroom while it auto completes.
---
Here's a possible solution: Drop the rad resist on the stealth suit by 75% to 250 (from 1,000). Still guards against most rads, but you'll have to pop a Rad X in nuke zones, and then we can allow for aesthetic outfits over it.
---
if there was a lvl 500 3 star sentry bot at the end of awol armaments i wouldnt even be mad, or a level 500 3* scorchbeast with lvl 200 scorched spawning at its a trap i wouldnt even be mad. If the rewards scaled maybe people would join as it is now having more than 2 people at an event is super rare.
---
I mean the point can be made, why does it cost any caps to go anywhere you've been before? Who is collecting them? No other Fallout game has done this. Is Todd hoarding nuka caps in his basement?
---
Waiting to see how this whole thing turns out is more interesting than the event itself.
---
Oof literally just happened to me tonight. Like congrats you’re a Lvl 200 who can kill a Lvl 35 who’s just trying to farm for concrete. Took all my shit too and hopped worlds. I was at 240 concrete just trying to contribute to the event
---
Nice
---
I'd love to make a mule to carry the things I have right now that I don't use but want to keep, or a second character to have as a different build supported by my main in the beginning. I just don't want to deal with muling it over using containers or dropping and potentially losing whatever I drop. An account wide box to transfer even a few items would be great.
---
Ok,good.
---
I've never seen a legendary 10m and I'm so upset
---
I completely agree
---
Just have a friend engage you in pvp and help, MUCH QUICKER
---
I wasn't able to complete it either yesterday but what worked for me was analyze the sample first then I put the T fuse in second, I could not complete it otherwise, it would just say no blood samples found.  
---
Another thing is, it took me a day of not playing the game for this way to work, because when I first encountered this bug, neither way would work for me.  I don't know if the server resets your character by waiting a while or what but it did finally work if I did it that specific way.
---
In the words of Kevin, “many small time add up to big time”. 
---
The 250 minimum is terrible. It should’ve been donate as much as you want for points or whatever then you can trade them with Dorsey and HE would give you the packs.
---
But also, they needed to make the packs much better. I don’t really want alcohol I kinda want something new
---
I use glowing balloons. LitS, Rad Rumble and Guided Meditation look like huge parties when it's all over.
---
I was curious, let's do the math:
---
7 Concrete per bag. 150M Concrete is demanded.
---
21,428,571 bags of Concrete are needed.
---
80 lb per bag, 1,714,285,680 lbs of Concrete is the total.
---
1 cubic yard of Concrete weighs 4,050 lbs.
---
423,280 cubic yards of Concrete for ATLAS.
---
Hoover Dam is 3.25M cubic yards of Concrete.
---
So, the BoS is using about 14% of the Concrete needed to build Hoover Dam for their ATLAS outpost.  That's a shitload of Concrete.
---
Hope it fixes everything for you. If you need help with modding the PA let me know, i have most mods and a spare set of PA should you need it.
---
Those used to drop frequently for me in early days.
---
This video helped me a lot, even though most likely i will not decode a launch code, i was still looking for it since i was wondering the same. It's explained rather quick too.
---

Like everyone said the production terminal in the enclave bunker sells x01 plans, but if you look on the armory terminal they have 3 or 4 mods for the x01 and they’re way cheaper but they’re on a constant rotation so you have to keep checking periodically to get the mods you want. I got my emergency protocols mod for like 300 caps instead of buying the plan for 1500
---
My guess is let us fail then put the items in the store. Does anyone without a FO 1st account even keep that much concrete?  I am FO 1st and I had a little under 1300 concrete because you really don't need it once you are done building.
---
Thanks! I think I’ve got it though. Weights already down to 240.
---
North of Clancy Manor, I think?   There’s a bird watching shelter with about 10 fire fly’s.  No fast travel point to it, so you just have to find it.  Maybe another player can explain the location better than me.  
---
Might also look around the Shallow Gnarls or whatever it’s called, near Abbys bunker?
---

---
Old chart but still accurate.
---
It depends on how big of attacks you're taking, the higher, single damage attack, the more DR you want.
---
It will, honestly its getting better it just takes a little time. I would get it for $20, its definitely worth that. Its fun man, honestly its one of those games that ypu really do have to play yourself to see if ya like it but I think you will.the community is great and its honeslty the most wolcoming community to new players ive ever seen. There are plenty of people to group up with and do events with and its super easy to find a high level player that will offer to will help you out and let ya tag along with them.
---
If I ever get more than 100 of anything other than steel/lead/wood, I bulk it and sell it. I don't have the room in my stash.
---
I just had one drop yesterday, ironically.
---
Yeah souds like somethings up
---
I think we find out that it’s just Rose screwing with us again.
---
Yup, this right here
---
Ive unfortunately been stuck with the sample allegedly in the centrifuge so i cant get another but its not really in there. Been this way for days. From the notes the fix will be removing content. Brilliant move.
---

---
Please no more currencies
---
I have MAYBE 2300 Concrete. That's from picking up everything I come across and never farming it.
---
I'm still working on getting unyielding SS pieces. RNGesus hasn't been kind to me amd after 163 (I counted) legendary modules I only have 2 pieces. Full set of SS troubleshooters armour, though.
---
I spawned at M Town Train Yard with lockpick, the 650 rad resistance and pharma farmer. Picked up 3 stimpacks, rad x, radaway and 2 extras, plus some marine armor. Let the storm catch up to me and followed the edge as it shrunk. When I stepped out of the storm, there was a player with his back to the storm, so I shot him in the head and made the top 9, lol.
---
Have had 2 drop in the last 8 hrs of gameplay.
---
Rng... Waddayagonnado
---
Same for the vendor tax. Where is it going?
---
I know it’s intended as a game balance, but it’s more of a nuisance. 
---
I’d rather see a Fast Travel stamina bar. You can stock up to three Fast Travel uses, and they take five minutes to refresh. Or something like that. Maybe even throw in an Endurance perk that reduces the refresh time or gives you an extra FT point.
---
I got both a instigating grog ax 2* an a mole miner gauntlet 3* earlier this afternoon
---
I would say go for it but there are still a bunch of glitches that haven’t been patched and I don’t know about pc but Xbox is somewhat alive
---
Exactly let us cripple the scorchbeast and boost her level, pretty much anyone can solo her so just make her tougher doesn’t seem that hard to do 
---
Plus some fights she barely calls on her squad, make her army come more often and frequently 
---
JESUS ITS NOT THAT HARD TO MAKE A VIDEO GAME BE A VIDEO GAME
---
Everything went green last night. I thought some new shit was going down and got stupidly excited.
---
Yes same here, it won't let you loot any more.  It will still be in the container and the game will still think you have it in your bags to add another, give it one more try if you haven't played for a while.  Just make sure you anaylyze the sample first (even though you don't have one) then go add the T fuse.
---
Edit:  I doubt it'll work if you played recently though, like I said the work around only worked when I haven't played for a day.  Hope it works for you.
---
Wtf literally just got a junkie with 50% vats and 25 less ap cost from mole...

There's that word again, 'heavy,' why are things so heavy in the future? Is there some type of problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?
---
But does it threaten to burn down my CAMP? Or give me good advice on how to spice the place up? I.e. this place could use more CORPSES
---
Cool story bro
---
uff it is hard to understand u actually. If u die in nuke zone u will spawn close to a location affected by radiation (in general) and u have like 10-15 sec to get outta there (while u r immune to radiation and any type of damage + u r invisible for mobs) but sometimes u cant run. I fight her without PA bcz i want more xp from mobs. If u join event first time u will be close to the fissure and with low health u should heal ur radiation wisely to not get over encumbered and pray that radshield + glow fungus soup will help to get out of there safe.
---
Of course u can put urself into PA before but there is a reason to not to (bcz of losing uny effects). The only way out is to get there before nuke droped and safely get out of blast zone or ft to a safe place and than have a walk. 
---
btw: x01 has more RR resistance than ultracite and from the main story u got a set of damaged ultracite PA so it is kinda ok but not that nice.
---
This week I got a 1 and 3 star Grognak.
---
What would be great is if they'd take the BoS events in the game and make them give you a little faction rep. Make it a little less mind numbingly boring than the settlers or raiders.
---
I personally always run Marsupial, Bird Bones and Speed Demon, with Class Freak maxed out you barely notice the negative effects.
---
I said that they will crank up the numbers well over the limit by the end of each event. In any case it will be their loss since the rewards are absolutely worthless (except maybe yet another double score, but some of us already finished season), denying even these ones will throw shadow on their rep yet another time and they can't afford bad publicity anyway. If they think they can, many of us already can't care less unfortunately for them.
---
PC?
---
Renting a room at the white springs would be sick. Esp if you could decorate it as you wish.
---
200 hours is not sufficient enough for 76’s rng. 
---
Not saying your time was wasted, but 76 rng is booty.
---
It can and will happen though when you least expect it.
---
They should have just kept bashing the same from fo4 tbh
---
I'd also add carnivore or herbivore. Pick one and food will be a while lot more useful.
---
No.
---
They do with the weapons they have. Not sure if it would work with weapons given to them.
---
how did you made the launcher??
---
I've got a half not bad set.. All Unyielding, 1 End WWR .. 1 Per JWR .. 1 STR Caviler .. 1 INT WWR .. Powered Fall Damage
---
I'm trying to get one more fall damage obviously and I want to get Powered on all of them eventually
---
Congrats on finishing your set!  I managed to scratch together a full unyielding set after an insane amount of rolls.  I would consider the legendary effects I ended up with to be rather lackluster, but I guess I shouldn’t complain about a full set of unyielding.  I would rather kick myself in the nuts than try to improve my legendary effects any further!
---
Sneak doesn't stack.  
---
Vanguards is pointless due to diminishing returns.  
---
Start again.
---
Same here, its such a downer.
---
I dont have trouble getting 3 stars, it's getting the best prefix that sucks the most.
---
No you can’t place atom shop items in another players camp.
---
Watch, it’ll have a 350 limit, but you can only get 5 Boscoins per day from one daily. The average price of an item will be 250, and sometimes it’ll bug out and not give you any boscoin at all. It just works. Ad Victoriam
---
I get them all the friggin time. Withbawful prefixes mind you. They make nice wall decor thats about it. 
---
Are you sure you have the plan unlocked?
---
I moved to a concrete node and grab abandoned bog  town when I log in. It's close to a donation per hour with those four nodes.
---
SS armor makes power armor obsolete
---
Quantums are the best. They can stack work faster than stim and have no animation. However they take a bit of grinding to get them by legit means. You could probably use regular Nuka or cherry which are more prevalent but they don't heal as much as Quantums.
---
But stims are so easy to get that it's pointless to not use them for regular stuff and save the Quantums for when you need more.
---
Funny how when this started everyone thought most the community not doing this and duper’s not helping was all a lie. Are you convinced yet?
---
Harpes Ferry by the chemistry bench near the vendor , 4 bags iirc
---
waaaait. what? if u spawn inside the fissure is a f\*\*ked up situation. never happened to me though and i have hungreds sbq done. I understood "in fissure" like at fissure or close to a green scar but not inside it.
---
I’ve gone there about 5 times now. Nothing
---
How much for the tse
---
Had three in one night.  Then I reset everything, PC, router, cable connection.  No crashes since.   I had already tried PC reset.
---
Also finished mine today, 3 pieces of unyielding along with 1 chameleon and a weightless piece until I can replace it. I think 2 or 3 came with WWR and one with FDC
---
This build makes for a VERY strong start: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOXqZEp2e0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOXqZEp2e0)

I am not quite sure how often it updates. I have seen it go for at least 8 hours without changing the numbers during the steel donation period.

Enterprise UX.

The total disconnect some folks have with how long it takes to make stable software boggles the mind. It’s a goddamned thankless grind that is surprisingly very political.
---
Really?  You wouldn’t welcome more non-Nuka Cola Bottlecap currency options?

You got it all wrong. They made him watch while they killed his best friend. Just look at the bear's face, it is full of terror.

try these
---
Cranberry Bog has many, especially northeast of Fissure Site Prime.
---
That seems probable.  
---
I wouldn't be surprised if we'll see really expensive plans locked behind a rep grind, but Bullion really feels like "end game currency" given its limits.
---
That would make WAY more sense
---
that's cuzz you are a karen, he had better times killing for Rose
---
B-b-but the bear's eyes are red though! 🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
How much steel do you need? I can spare some! Ign's VvT.
---
I swear ive gotten fewer unyielding tha. Any other rolls. I think i ott maybe ONE unyielding powered peice out out of a few hundered rolls.
---
Welcome to rng.  I’ve had several runs of getting 3* unyieldings back-to-back, but also a run of getting 4 nocturnals in a row.  I know it took me over 200 modules before I finally completed a good set of what I wanted; now I’m happy to say that I just craft them when I’m bored and want to try my luck at getting the ultimate god-rolls.
---
Been there. Gotten traders and just random encounters
---
Dude 😂. My friend just got on and asked me “Hey I have a 2 star two shot lever action you want to trade for it“ like what are the fucking chances
---
That was amazing, you're amazing, sorry so many people whooshed!
---
I know. LOL I just really love picking stuff up. It’s how I played Skyrim too. Forever overweight.
---
I wear the collar with the plague dr mask so it probably does
---
There is an estimate of about 35k people that play Fallout 76 each day.  If everyone busted their butt and got 250 concrete to donate each day, we would get 8.75m a day.  This doesn't take into account all of the people who don't have Fallout 1st or the ability to get on every day for long enough.  This doesn't work out mathematically.
---
From the tears
---
Idk what's good price but honestly it's like my own good weapon so I'd rather trade for another useful one. I'd love a nice fixer never had one.
---
Man I really fucking hate the Original Raiders of Appalachia, they weren’t raiderey or anything, they were just pure Fallout 3 Enclave evil
---
Bitch if you don’t like it stop playing. I’m sick of all these little bitches bitching just because one of millions of tiny details didn’t go their way. FFS
---
Cork is good for turning armor into ultra light so mules can hold more.
---
 But still don't think we will hit that amount.
---
&gt; You can stand outside for around 45 seconds before you die. If you get one stimpak you can run back in and heal then run out again for the final 15
---
That's not true, it has to be a complete minute in one go. You can't leave the fire once you're inside it. I completed the daily using a single stimpack extra.
---
It could of ran away seeing its not tied up. lol
---
You're probably right though...
---
[Feast your eyes!](https://imgur.com/xVi0hSL)
---
Odd. I'm lucky if I hear that chems line once every few of days I run through Spruce Knob for the daily. If that much. Usually they're just flatly commenting or complimenting on my gear, underarmor I have on, or weapon's condition.
---
The only one there that's a smarmy jerk all the time, is Ward. Who amusingly, is a former Crater Raider.
---
No. Not unless they remove the bullion cap.
---
Well mr.negative nancy
---
Not pointless 3 peices should net a 3% damage reduction vs all enemies per peice. I understand deminishing returns, have written about it here on the the sub a few times. Like in these 2 posts:

As far as sneak is concerned havent seen concrete evidence that they dont stack. Angry turtles videos which are treated like the fallout bible,he based the sneak detection on a turret which even he himself admits wasnt the most consistent in detection if i remember correctly. If you have info on sneak and could point me in the right direction to prove otherwise i would genuinely appreciate it.
---
Love the hanging bloated. Reminds me of the cliffhanger cartoon clips on PBS when I was a kid
---
Whatever happened, it was fucked up :D
---
Lol
---
If they're just there to farm xp then just do what you gotta do, if they were participating then it's nice to share.
---
Which mod is better for adding PA carry weight, the one that adds carry weight or the ones that adds strength?
---
Why i'm not surprised?
---
But they can't fire Todd

Thank you for this

I just feel it's not worth the money and lackluster added extras for subscribers. But mainly playing with people who don't have it, I started to feel disgusted by the business practice of the scrap box and tent.
---
I use ramps to force floor levels up and down.
---
Well yea that's to be expected lol of this is Bethesda
---
even better!
---
If it looks cool, or does something unique, then probably.
---
&gt;suddenly become a rip off
---
Also didn't say suddenly its been an increasing feeling.
---
I've been thinking that someone added an erroneous zero to both the concrete and cork goals.
---
It's not meant for us
---
One is for torso, the other is for legs. Better for direct carry weight, especially nearing 25 strength where it stops giving returns for increases. 
---
I actually just bought the calibrated shocks for my excavator armor.
---
IMO, yes, a lot of people overlook or just don’t notice the ore part as I’ve observed because 4 of the 5/6 lines are about the Scavengers and their health bars and don’t notice the ore part, that’s why stuff like Emmett Hazard Suit or Rad Barrel plan. Also, by you not calling out legendaries, you’re actually stooping to their level, I say as long they don’t one shot it, give them the callout.
---
A lot of games have perks for money like that. Most mmos have that
---
Considering the ammo farms I found underground by stalking people to their underground camps then yes, yes it is
---
Didn't mean to add image
---
Yes, and they are gross as well.
---
How are most players even meant to know to donate, there is no in game event icon or quest right?
---
The enclave made the serums!  They'd want us to use em
---
Ah! Is calibrated shocks the carry weight one? Which vendor did ya buy them from? Loose mods, or the plans?
---
Damn really? I got one and thought it was common but it looked cool so I keep it in my stash
---
Doesnt mean they moved since the update. And if you have an ammo farm, there is little likeliness you would move.
---
The hats are not rare by any means. In fact, in one run of the asylum you may find all colors. In other words, they are not worth really anything unfortunately.
---
There's no benefit to one shotting or going out of your way to kill the legendary mobs where simply tagging would suffice.
---
Yes, I paid 5800 for the plans at the camden park vendor, I dont think you can get them another way. Also, they require 5 violet flux which im about to put on the market to request someone sell to me.
---
first point isnt correct. the best place so far is whitespring bcz u have more ghouls there, some SupMut, miners, wolfs etc to spawn so more chances. didnt read the rest bcz tl;dr 
---
if u got there an event "the messenger" u should do it "yes or yes" bcz u will get a chance to loot like 20-30 molerats (i dont know the exact number but it was huge).
---
I threw a bit at it (whopping 500) just to see how bad the rolls really were. Missed steel because I need that shit.
---
It's not that there aren't enough events;  it's that the events have minimal value.
---
For my perspective - there are two main reasons I do events:
---
1.  Treasury notes.  In which case, it's a factor of Time + Effort + Other Value (see 2) vs. Reward.  
---
2.  Exp, which is going to come from the mass slaughter of enemies.  
---
I play primarily on a private server - so the mobs are mine to farm, so to speak.  The events I'll do.....
---
1.  Uranium Fever (95% of the time);  8 minutes, lots of mobs to kill.  crafting station to salvage so you can loot it all).  3 legendaries guaranteed.  Also worth running around the area to clear out the mobs after finishing the event.  
---
2.  Swampfever (60% of the time).  It seems to take me about 5 minutes flat (I always finish with 25 minutes left).  So it's easy treasury notes.
---
3.  Nightstalker (60% of the time).  I just load up the jukebox, wait for the mobs to rush in - kill them all.  Finish off the nightstalker.  Also takes about 5-6 minutes.
---
4.  Lode Bearring (50% of the time).  It seems like this event is up the most.  And it's either run around and kill a bunch of enemies or afk at the entrance;  either way, easy treasury notes;  takes about 7-8 minutes.
---
The key thing - for all 4 of these - you get to kill a lot of enemies.  So good exp and salvage.
---
On a public server, I'll sometimes join Radiation Rumble &amp; Project Paradise.  (can also solo Radiation Rumble, but not worth the stress/hassle of it).  
---
Outside of that - the only event I'll do is Breach &amp; Clear.  The hoarder in me loves adding to the stash of materials, and it's a nice stream of mobs to kill.  
---
Outside of that... nadda.
---
I'm convinced the only way to go, is craft naked. 50 mods in one shot, not a single unyielding piece (I was wearing all unyielding). Got multiples of every other prefix
---
myth. better with salt works quite well with that.
---
I have a fixer
---
Also what kind of tse is it
---
kobe!
---
The plague doctor mask covers the whole face tho, making it more like the gas masks. The Pathfinder Mask more resembles a bandanna in terms of coverage.
---
I do appreciate knowing that regardless, as I am probably gonna buy the plague mask soon. Thank you.
---

---
I still am annoyed I never end up getting salvage from the whole ordeal.  Just some random shitty ammo &amp; water.
---
Story’s overrated imo I liked its quest depth (different ways to complete them) but that’s about it
---
If you going full health then the meta is Vanguard/Sentinel/AP Refresh.
---
Said in the  other reply i seriously feel like ive gotten unyielding less than any other effect, let alone uny powered. I thought it was just me.
---
I think your fine.  If I'm at an event and everyone is at least trying I wave them over.  If you hiding or just tagging things I don't really care about your feelings.  Of course I don't know why people get so upity about legos.....its just gonna be a 1 star nocturnal wood leg anyways.
---
Do what you gotta do to survive. It's the wasteland.
---
Srry to say but they got to make money somewhere. And if there isn’t a membership they have to look elsewhere. Examples are the atom shop or fallout 1st or eso with their membership that comes with a crafting bag

I don't trust Bethesda to implement mods for Fallout 76.  Something tells me they'll do as much as they can to control how mods are made and either have a very strict curation of mods,  or they'll make 'mods' like Creation Club, and you can only use them if you're on Fallout 1st in a private server with a special character or something.

Most railway bots sell bulk concrete.

I just equipped to bobblehead finder perk for the first time today, never knew how many bobble heads I was walking past!
---
I put a request for 13, i need 3 and it takes 10 to do both legs. You want to jump in game when I get them I would be happy to do the mod for you and you can save some caps on the plan.
---
I do think they're working on updates for it but im pretty sure it takes a back seat. Which is a shame because it needs a lot of quality of life improvements to overall gameplay.  
---
Especially with the pandemic their timeline for stuff just got pushed back.
---
I built his bar over a cliff, he'd spawn and immediately fall to his death. then 10 seconds later he'd spawn at the bar again and fall to his death.it was glorious.

---
The majority of my legendary handmades have been gifted to me. I rolled a 3* suppressor's handmade tonight. Still garbage.
---
Plus I've only ever rolled like, one or two Fixers. They too were garbage.
---
What about a non-feral ghoul leading an army of enraged ferals? I like the idea of a very large Ghoul, but it would look very strange in the Fallout series.
---
I also think that a Super Mutant siege involving an intelligent Super Mutant leader and multiple Behemoths would work. Just crank up their difficulty, make the Behemoths more along the lines of the SBQ and WC (but maybe not individually as bullet spongey), and hold off the hordes of Super Mutants who want to make the WS their new base of operations!
---
There's so many ideas for this game floating around in the community, and I'd love it if Bethesda even occasionally took them seriously. Some of them aren't possible with the current engine, but quite a few would make welcome additions to Appalachia
---
And that's common use stuff. Things like Cork and Cement that I don't use? I keep 25 or less.
---
This is where we really need text chat...
---
Now that sounds immersive to me. I should more work on the picking stuff up portion. Hahah
---
NE of Flatwoods Ag Research facility, follow the dry river bed and go up the hill on your left.
---
This is another great tool. Thanks for your work.
---
Today I found a pompadour wig sitting on a table next to the weapons bench in the basement of the Rusty Pick. It's the first time I've seen one, and it's listed as an event reward but not as a world spawn. Is that a new spawn location? 
---
Ninja edit: I guess the Rusty Pick counts as a Wealthy location for spawn locations. Interesting.
---
There is not other way to store other stuff besides your stash. You could use other characters but that is difficult without a private server
---
I've been lucky on secondary effects like poison and wwr, but I'd love to get some Vanguard prefixes. Way too many auto stim, nocturnal, and bolstering.
---
i'll give that a try when it does that next. hasn't been an issue till last night and today. just random logs in the woods it wouldn't do it for so i was trying to gather tons of junk with wood in them to break down lol
---
It's got 25 percent reduce ap cost if that's what you mean
---
And normally I do. Had plenty of times where a couple players and I would even msg ahead of time we’re not trying to go for ore.
---
It was just a mixture of:
---
- Showing up after the bigger waves were handled
---
- A large group showing up and still not really doing a dent in the ghouls as I had to handle about 60% of them
---
- many had builds that were useless for killing but would have been able to complete the event and were near lvl 200 so understood what was supposed to happen 
---
- Were letting ghouls slip past that I had to handle
---
So for me the event wouldn’t have even happened if I didn’t wait for 7 minutes by Marion for them to show up and hadn’t put in the work handling the initial waves. And with all those listed things... it added up to them contributing when it was convenient, which is fine but I don’t think I should have been expected to take the time to call out when they couldn’t help out in any of the mentioned areas.
---
Personally I don’t mind stooping to another player’s lvl if I’m better at it. If you’re going to be selfish. You at least have to be good at it!
---
Also do you have anyways they could make money besides these things?
---
Really? I’d appreciate it! So you need three more Violet Flux? I’ve got 4 to donate to you to help out.
---
Just play around by moving the camp module.
---
The spawn point for my camp is now just inside the front “gates”.
---
You can make mule characters and transferring thing to that character to hold on things for you if you can find someone trust worthy to hold on to the stuff you want to transfer for you meanwhile you switch characters but otherwise without Fallout 1st your pretty much out of other options.
---
is it  the same same reward, isnt it? plan, booze, granade and stimpak? looks like a perfect plan for unsuccessful suicide.
---
I really hope that do something with it. I've been hooked on it since they added it and now when I play adv mode it is just really boring to me. That's just my opinion. I play on xbox (no hackers) and the lobbies are almost always full throughout the day. I am lvl 370 and a lot of my friends are right behind me in rank and  a few that are over rank 400 and 500. Everyone still loves nuclear winter on xbox even with all the bugs. I wish that they would add some kind of perk card to help against explosives or nerf the spawn rate of grenades and buff the spawn rate of stimpacks. Nuclear winter still has a lot of potential and is still fun to play. I hope that they don't get rid of it like survival which wasn't that fun. If they do I'll probably stop playing fallout since nw is the only reason I play.
---
What kind of weapon is it
---
Easy, puts the total down to 9 for both of us. Ill message you direct when I get the rest of the flux
---
I have 2, run out of materials too quickly
---
maybe "they" want us to fail, so "they" can insist it's our fault the next thing is delayed.
---
What platform my guy?
---
While rad rumble I’d argue tagging is much harder in general as that enemy can kill the scavs quickly. Read my reasoning for it, it wasn’t about not wanting to deal with tagging-I usually tag 2 and 3*’s at minimum- but the situation I was in. At some point it seems selfish playing shouldn’t be rewarded
---
He's talking about the prospective community awards that would have given an opportunity for new players to catch up a bit on the season.
---
I think it might be on that little ‘news’ splash screen, but that’s it. No one ever pays attention to that either
---
nope!
---
holy people will argue about the smallest things for the sake of arguing
---
It is true. Thats literally how I finished the challenge
---
This used to upset me, but now after countless Encrypted events I find it amusing the low levels set the event off and laugh at the fact that they don't know what they're in for and they're going to get their ass kicked
---
I’m glad I’m at least not alone on that haha. If they were helping sooner or carrying their weight I would’ve felt I should make callouts. Some low dmg CB rifles just felt like xp farming to me.
---
It's an event. The goal is to complete it, not to farm leggos. I've never run rad rum on a public world, but ran project p hundreds on public, and guess what happened... it failed often because everyone focused on the leggos instead of the event.
---
I'm on tonight on PS4 if your still looking to boost, I need revives as well. DM for ID!
---
I never knew that I needed this...and now I have a goal
---
Im gonna give this a shot tomorrow thanks.

---
Because Fallout fans wanted a co-op fallout not an MMO but there's no money in co-op
---
They need to be a pet option whenever we get around to pets.
---
Don't forget the "Unless there are less than 20 seconds" caveat.
---
Do you wanna trade
---
i am stunned you had 55k steel
---
Nooooooo never before have I been so sad to play on Xbox
---
I would think Bethesda knows roughly how much cork/concrete the average stash/scrap box has and *may be* trying to flush out any would be dupers turning in large quantities of said materials. 
---
Still, seems like they should have rolled that decimal up a couple places. 250m seems like an awful lot. I'll be lucky to turn in 1k of each both weeks.
---
Both have been done in fallout but they would still make for interesting content
---
Pre-War Money *is* junk
---
i just went out and cleared my stash..for some reason i had 660 fertilizer and like 500 bone shards or what ever it is
---
Wastelad is actually fun
---
The game technically has no limit but going past 350 Damage Resistance / 375 Energy Resistance will start yielding diminishing returns in terms of how much Defense will protect you from damage so picking up gear and perks that further increase those things are technically not needed for Vanguard builds since it's not hard to hit those Resistance limits. We're talking about needing to stack an extra +100 Damage Resistance just to take 1% less damage sort of diminishing returns. 
---
This is the whole reason I thought it was pointless to aim for the Secret Service Armor set because you don't need that much DR/ER so instead I picked to roll for the Solar Set instead because it's Armor Set Bonus is far more advantageous for Vanguard players like myself.
---
Look around for level 15 or 20 raider power armour. There are a few spots around the map
---
At Radiation Rumble, no, just kill everything. There’s way too much chaos there to call out legendaries. If you do that everybody will abandon the NPC’s and run over. 
---
If you’re at something like Uranium Fever, that’s a different story. Those are easy and predictable, no reason everyone can’t have a shot.
---
What's your ign? Mind if I add you?
---
It's like though it has it's downs, fallout 76 still has a little heaven in the community
---
I use colas on one character instead of stimpacks. They heal very fast and have other benefits that stimpacks don't. If you're not in PA, the lack of a usage animation is a great time saver in the middle of a fight. And you get a cap every time you heal yourself.
---
AP refresh. Following by weight reduction of ammo, junk.
---
His ex chose concrete over him. Anyone would.
---
Yeah I am a garbage hoover when I play and pick up allll the things and I only had 1.5k concrete. 
---
And to my knowledge, there aren't any decent concrete farming spots. Lead pipes only give you 1, and the bags are subject to the world respawn rules which takes awhile to let them respawn.
---
I’ve done the exact same thing for my garage as well! Would love to have barricades made out of old car hulls as well.
---
Allow us to keep the wallpaper we purchased with atoms!
---
You make some great points. Like you said there’s nothing happening on the map.  The steel collection was so low key I didn’t realize it had even started. Beth has underutilized Atlas so much that I never go there. When I did go and donate the reward box wasn’t worth the time it took to fast travel there and deposit my steel. And then we have to wait on the beret. With all those factors I completely forgot that concrete collection was live today. When I was in the map screen looking for some event to do I didn’t notice any extra activity at Atlas to remind me.
---
Thats just the wire being a pain in front of something im sure its the ability to move wires from conduits to other things like say vendors or light boxes without deleting it and making a new one atleast thats broke for me idk about yall
---
I’m Fo1. I had 900 cork.
---
Most people who dupped, dupped useful / valueable stuff. Concrete not that useful or valueable in Fallout 76.
---
So the atomic shop is where you can buy cosmetics and CAMP items. Nothing is p2w. You pay with atoms.
---
You can complete challenges to earn atoms, or spend real money to buy atom packs
---
Ide rather see what they do when it doesnt
---
The reward(turn in) is not worth it. Had to spend 5 minutes throwing floater grenades down the stairs at the Rusty pick after donating quite a bit of steel and the stuff I could sell or use didn't "cap out" more than I could have sold the scrap for. 
---
Concrete is worse. I farm it all the time because I build a lot, but the value is 10x the steel. 
---
This entire community event is a failure. Every 3 to 5 turn ins should drop a PRIME weapon plan or rare camp plan, EVERY turn in should give 2 to 3 stable flux, high radiation, or harden mass.
---
Honestly if they gave that as a pet I would side with the settlers other than that I side with personality
---
What's your ign I wanna experience this place
---
I'd bet it will be the first option. After the mess this week with the new patch, I really think (or I'd like to think) they wouldn't want to bury themselves any further. I mean, this event is just embarrassing. Rewards are just garbage plain and simple. The "goal" rewards are pretty bad too. There is no reason to participate.
---
I’m thinking you probably should have crafted ammo with your steel and gunpowder.....🤔
---
No crossplay. I only play nuclear winter and hackers would ruin it for everyone. Nuclear winter still has a large player base on xbox. I would play warzone more but the PC hackers are ruining it.  There is no option to turn crossplay off.
---
ikr
---
As a one month old player, they overshot on all parts of this. Total volume is too high, per donation amount being 250 us too high, and the rewards and rate at which you get the better ones are too low. 
---
If I could donate 25 and get crappy rewards then okay, no big deal. I'll try some more. But 250 is a lot to gather and then I get some beers? No reward for effort and so no point in doing it.
---
Cool. Look forward to throwing Enclave officers in front of a firing squad.
---
is the collectron station wood ?
---
i want that
---
To your “idiot-proof” analysis towards building, it is something the devs mentioned in their Q&amp;A this weekend that they wanted to change.
---
Their comments suggested the current mechanics are less about keeping people from doing stupid things and more that players could actually break the game with certain configurations. Overlapping objects specifically could lead to server crashing bugs if don’t in certain ways.
---
Their hope is with their winter shelters update will alleviate server stress and allow them to start breaking down the snapping mechanics so it’s optional, as well as just expand building in general so that players have greater freedom to build the way they want.
---
If you’re curious about a few workarounds too, there are fallout youtubers like jug who have come up with some awesome ideas that take advantage of current mechanics! Just wants to add some hope there that one of your concerns is theoretically going to be a big update later this year or the beginning of next
---
there's too much gunpowder, and not enough steel.
---
and, some ammo requires no gunpowder...

Yea I pissed off the altruistic goody two shoes a month or so.  I was bitching bout AWOL and level 16's hiding in the corner and not even distracting the gutsies.  They didn't appreciate how I led the gutsies over to him
---
This whole damn game is an erroneous zero..
---
As I understand it, the Whitespring's renovations have been complete for quite some time; at this point the robots are just waiting for a Building Inspector to come by and inspect it, and no one has the credientials to baffle them.
---
Decent idea otherwise though.

---
On PS4 today the server I was on didn’t have enough people to take down the SBQ. Well, there might have been enough of us if the couple of griefers that came down to Scorched Earth and manually exited the event and walked in front of low level players so they got shot and then shot back to instigate PvP had fought the queen instead. Those jerks repeatedly did it to  the low levels for the whole 25 minutes.
---
This would require precise timing.  LITS is too short to do a full silo run after it starts and there's no way to trigger LITS, so you'd have to wait in the silo hoping for LITS to trigger.
---
Yeah we aren't getting any of the shit they put in their updated road map. It will all be next year
---
Gunpowder should be made a junk item in my opinion or made lighter.
---
Exactly. Draw from the existing lore and let us play it in glorious HDR! I know we can't have the Master because of geography, but I'd take a Master knock off any day
---
There's different teams that work on different parts of the game. Its not just 1 large team that all focus on one thing
---
And the Chinese stealth armour 😉
---
Literally yesterday discovered I had this problem with Stimpacks. For the life of me for the last two weeks I couldn't figure out why I had next to know room for items and was constantly at 300+. Wife started playing and I went to give her my diluted ones to find I had 60 regular and 120 supers. Sold half of the supers and and gave her all the regulars, and now weight isn't a problem anymore.
---
I got uber lucky with my set. All Vanguard Cavalier +STR, it was the first stuff I bought with bullion. It took about a week to get the whole set. I had alot of modules saved up, plus scrip in general
---
Since then I've got a tricked out T65 set, gauss shotgun, minigun, pistol, and plasma caster. Bought a few of the camp items, but I'm running out of stuff to spend gold on since i already had the Vault 94 gear. Hoping the BoS expansion has a cool 2 handed gold bullion weapon. Auto axe maybe?
---
I just nuke it and hope for the best. Usually do 2, one on white springs to pass the time and the other down there.
---
Especially if it's "rear".
---
While I wouldn't mind a warm scalp, I am busy doing the dailies and weeklies. If I had time I would probably just nuke the bat rather than collect rubbish.
---
This. I always play the ore gatherer/NPC healer at Rad Rumble and never see anyone call out legendaries, nor do I expect them to. It's pretty much the single most chaotic event and it can be overwhelming just trying to complete the objectives.
---
Also its not unlimited stash storage, its only junk storage. The subscription is also incredibly worth it.
---
You get a nuke and you get a nuke.  Everyone gets a nuke!
---
Not worth my time, sorry. Gonna gather leather and cloth for sure
---
Please God, not gnomes.... those hollow dead eyes haunt me!
---
I like to share the ballistic irradiated love.
---
It's nice to not drop it on death.
---
Most of the camp build concerns would be resolved if they had crafted a better system. 
---
Some Fallout 4 workshop mods blew BGS's shitty system outta the water. They should've learned from the coldness most average players felt torwards the base game + DLC workshop content. The Vault DLC was good, but it's on *thin fucking ice*
---
Oprah? Ghoul Oprah, is that you?
---
Seeing this too :(
---
Its not that man, after the steel portion I honestly think people realized this is a waste. The rewards for donating are middle finger followed by a slap in the face to the player base. I bet we will get the reward for concrete event. Bethesda will make some kind of excuse such as saying they overestimated and made the goal too high so we will get the banner and then each event after this the total needed will be lowered dramatically. Just watch.
---
Open and close your pip boy while in the lobby
---
I'd want a pet mole miner... Yeah i know they were human but i love the way they stumble and mumble around
---
Wow.. real good job!
---
That would be too hard to implement
---
From now on everything will be bought with bullion, and character locked. We'll also reduce the total you get in a day from 200 to 50. Since you can get anything with it now
---
Yeah, it should at least give a decent chance to get a legendary from the purveyor pool. That'd be at least something. But beers and useless grenades which are basically everywhere?..
---
Had to read it twice to make sense of your spelling but you're looking for the Powered Gates plans:
---
Sold by the following vendors: 
---
Brotherhood vendor 
---
Grahm 
---
Raiders vendor 
---
Watoga vendor bot 
---
Vendor bot Phoenix 
---
Vendor bot Wallace 
---
Vendor bot Resin 
---
Vendor bot Raider 
---
Pleasant Valley station 
---
Sunnytop station 
---
R&amp;G station 
---
Shopping mall vendor 
---
Free States vendor
---
This is APPALACHIAAAAAAA
---
This is awesome, thank you
---
They happen. I got a Legendary Instigating/+10% Dmg/15% reload speed Fixer after literally about 3000 scrip worth off the Purveyor.
---
As a full HP build its still a one shot machine for anything not a 'big' type critter under stealth conditions.
---
Unyielding and vanguard. Ap refresh or sentinel for number two. Third one isn’t as important. Damage resistance from poison and rads is good on unyielding. Ammo and junk weight reduction.
---
*power*
---
298 items, all weighing 1 to 2. My stash space just got sad. Guess I need to make mule character
---
So what? Bethesda will say we did to save face. If they want the players to do something they have to make it fun. What they gave us was a job.
---
Will Line in the Sand proc if there is an existing nuke zone sitting on top of Fort Defiance?  And how long does a nuke zone last on the server?
---
Good job
---
You can Can only get a legendary dragon from the reward terminal in watoga highschool, and inky as 1*
---
But, after patch 21 there is now alot more possibly to earn fixers since they can from from events now
---
Congrats, keep killing the winged rodents
---
30%, not 45
---
The non-daily challenges for staying inside the fire only count complete minutes. I don't know why the daily would be different.
---
I don’t really care about trophies just happy to help :)
---
Lots of users have been saying they think Bethesda will auto complete it, but I'm not aware of any official statements to that effect.
---
Just recently upgraded my last two pieces of Unyielding, though the left arm is still only 2*. Also only piece away from full Weightless set and full Troubleshooters set each.
---
You can have 5 characters. So 4000 total carry weight. Create a character and then walk him to a train station. Build a basic camp and fill him up with junk, aid, caps, whatever. Use a trustworthy friend or Facebook courier to move items off your main. I would keep it simple by having one for water,stims, radaway. Another for armour, and one for weapons. You can hold a total of 150k caps this way as well.
---
It's not too bad, you just hop on a public server with a friend, drop everything in an inconspicuous public container and pick it up with your other player.
---
Yup. This is big too, I think. I logged on for the past two days and completed my score challenges without remembering there was an ATLAS event going on. 
---
The game needs to do more to remind people of these special events.
---
Yea it's not the worst but personally it is kinda stressfull wondering if someone will just pull up and take everything valuable
---
Oh I know. The rewards don’t justify the cost. I turned in maybe 2k steel then just went “nah I’m good” and completely stopped even going to the observatory. I went when it changed to concrete to see if anything changed and it did, lot of more stuff sitting around, but the community doesn’t care about the rewards from the provisions.
---
Yes because their will be new weapons and such. Gotta add that new grind.
---
🙋‍♂️I do!  I always spare V-9.
---
That's why you have a friend.  Also the chance of someone looting a super obscure container is unlikely.
---
For the curious on how we did it: [https://i.imgur.com/jPKehpZ.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/jPKehpZ.jpeg)  
---
I'll let you figure out anything that doesn't make sense on your own, as that was most of the fun for us.
---
you're a good one
---
1. Every problem you encountered came from you. You didn’t wake hungry and thirsty. U went to sleep hungry and thirsty. You didn’t wake over encumbered. You went to sleep over encumbered. Youre hoarding ore yet don’t have acid. And the list goes on. All on you. It’s a post apocalyptic survival game. Yet you come up with a convoluted idea to change your base. With no prep to do it. Just give me everything now or it’s micro management. Let me make a suggestion. Fo76 doesn’t sound like it’s the game for you. What you want is Minecraft. On the setting my son plays it where u can build and build and build and not worry about anything at all because u have unlimited everything.
---
Don't forget to take a picture in photomode for the memories!
---
Chem backpack.
---
Does sneak even stack?...
---
Problem with this is having a friend that plays the game. A lot of my friends are avoiding fo76 still because of the initial release rather than give it a chance a few years later with all the updates.
---
Better yet if you're aligned with Crater gang, you could be apart of the raids.  Make pvp great again!
---
They added the BoS finally?
---
I think the zone last about 2 hours, and I've done it 2 out of 3 nukes now!
---
Oh and a tiny tip which may or may not help with your weight. Thinks like fusion cores and stims weigh a lot and for some reason people think they need to store 100 stims. U don’t. They’re readily available just like cores and if u do feel you’re using a shit tonne of either there’s perks to make them weigh next to nothing.  Same with ammo. Don’t store it. Take bandolier and carry it with u. Stuff like ore. Only take if u can smelt it. And once u have smelted it. Turn it into ammo. Figure out what scrap You use. Gold copper and crystals? U really need 1638 of them?
---
Yeah they would just end up having bullion rewards turning into missiles lol.
---
Still need Uny arms, then I may start rerolling the others as some are only 1-2*. Think I'm probably nearing or past 200 modules at this point, but due to work being so heavy right now I'm far more of a filthy casual than usual.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Oh my god... all this time... thanks for the info
---
Stupid question, but you are scrapping armor, right? It's significantly less likely to unlock mods compared to weapons but it is still how many of the mods are unlocked. Keep in mind limbs and torso are separate, so you'll get torso mods from scrapping chest pieces and limb mods from scrapping arm and leg pieces. Pocketed and deep pocketed are all sale-only as far as I know, but I have found them in player vendors for much, much cheaper than NPC vendors (I saw a deep pocketed leather torso plan for 20 caps last night) and if they're like me they might just give you the plans for free if you ask. I only charge for plans in my vendor to prevent people from taking them to resell.
---
You're English. Only the English whinge this hard.
---
Tell me I'm wrong ;)
---
Crappy loot but a thrilling time.
---
Nw is the only reason I play anymore. Adv mode is super boring to me now. Too much of a grind. Travel here and there and then go get that. Im on xbox would play warzone more but there is no option to turn off cross play. Don't want to play with PC hackers.
---
thanks alot, srry for the bad hand righting. my hands where cold and i was kinda in a hurry
---
At this rate if the keep adding new currencies it might as well be Fallout: currency exchange simulator.
---
Well.... how did you get scammed?
---
The struggle with being a nerd rage bloodied build in secret service armor is real with this one
---
I got the vocal sac though. I’ve heard people talk about how it’s a fairly rare item to get and I’ve seen people selling it in their vendors for thousands upon thousands of caps, so what should I do with it?
---
Oh thats pretty good, overall you can earn atoms by just playing the game
---
In the meantime just show up naked.
---
I was trading with this guy Snorlax, and he said he had a courier so I said okay the courier came up to me offered to trade gave him my BE Laser and then they both left the game at the same time taking my rifle with them
---
As well as how. Where? Was this all through the game or did you meet them through reddit? If you know their tags on here and the used their true accounts through the f76 market it could be worthy of kicking them from there. at the least any karma they’d earned would reset and prevent future scams
---
This is hype for the new quest coming, nothing more
---
This just sounds lile a long list of gripes and complaints saying "oh the game is too hard, prices are too high". 
---
You make caps like crazy and never need food/water once you understand the game. The game isnt hard, maybe it has an annoying learning curve but that goes away
---
It was on the LFG for Xbox
---
Thanks
---
Snorlax woke up long enough to quickly rip you....
---
Yes, sadly
---
Definitely new assault rifles, anti-materiel rifle and Tesla canon. Can't wait;) bye all xxx2525.
---
The sneak pieces stack so can lose sneak perk points. The problem is none of its Uny so losing points in agility ie moving sneak points will hurt your sneak. I run no sneak perk and no sneak pieces with low health Uny and can give a super mutant a reach around without coming out of caution now. Think it caps at 90% like everything else. Try running WS with sneak taken out of your load out and see how it goes. U might be surprised at how sneaky u are with 3 pieces
---
It’s possibly going to be a new crafting junk item like assaultron boards or sheepsquat quills. My guess is it relates to a new armor or it can upgrade/apply the effect of cursed items somehow, that will come with the colossal problem event.
---
Just came back to play after its... questionable release. I love the purveyors name, it's how she pronounces it.
---
Man, I just want to find the Witch's costume, there's so few dresses in this game. I was rocking the Civil War Dress, but since grabbing the Grognak bundle using that instead.
---
Good hype idea be killing scorch while in BOS power armour for rewards or even collected some kind of token to be donated at atlas.  Just thought of that on the fly.  Still lazy.  Just really hope the right effort is put into the rest of the DLC.
---
Sounds like you have alot of the problems I have/had/working on resolving.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Excavator power armor with the carry capacity mod on legs, will give you +200lb carry capacity. 100 from the full set, and +50 per leg mod (Motion Assist I think). You can also add the +STR mod on the torso to add a little bit more to the carry weight. With this, my carry weight is similar to my full unyielding set.
---
  
---
I use the food weight reduction mod for my backpack, but when I go into PA, I lose that buff, so I have to put on 3 ranks of the perk card to compensate.
---
And... on top of that, I have grilled radstag food, whiskey, fern tea, deathclaw/stingwing steaks for traveling (these foods add STR or CarryWeight). Occasionally crafting ant larger and smoked mirelurk meat if I'm really overweight.
---
I use the perk load out manager for PC, this allows me to have a Perk Set for fast traveling, has all the weight reduction perks. Then have another set for PA use, and another for non-PA. And if that wasn't enough, another set for repairing, crafting, etc.
---
The part I'm working on is clearing out all the food and chems I don't use. I am constantly near the weight limit, and don't have stash space to put stuff up for sale.
---
Yes, I'm a hoarder
---
The physics ingame is a tad odd.
---
So the bomber is ultra? Hm, I have two of them.
---
So I should stash it just in case?
---
This is a fact. lol
---
Its dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew.
---
after putting in 20k steel i’m thinking i’m set. i have about 2000 concrete and just over 1000 cork. i’m keeping both
---
I’m also a hoarder because I always think, “what if I need this later on”? I keep alchohol for carry weight purposes too.
---
Yeah no problem! Glad to help!
---
Once again for those in the back.
---
Not passively!
---
I can do a Prison run, gathering lead and weapons *and then* dip back to my camp to grab 75 caps worth of water **everytime**.
---
It's just free money. Provided you're the type to go back to camp periodically. Set a stash box beside your purifiers and get in the routine of grabbing and stashing them. Every time you hit a vendor you can empty your stash of water for big bank, on top of whatever you've been scavenging!
---
Explain how it is not true that farming steel is exponentially easier than farming concrete 
---
Line In The Sand + scrapper.. where is the concrete equivalent?
---
Yup also theres more than enough cool clothing and camp plans already in the game that you wont need to spend atoms on special things
---
The resources have to come from one of two sources:
---
1. Pre-existing stashes.
---
2. Resources deliberately collected for the event.
---
Concrete is a nightmare for both of these: it's not used for much so people haven't bothered hoarding it in the past (or duping it), and there's only a very limited ability to collect more in a short period of time (you're basically limited to a few extractors and a few world objects - that have probably already been looted!). Steel was the exact opposite: it's so abundant that it's easy to collect more at short notice (just kill a bunch of enemies and scrap their weapons), and because it's so abundant people have already accumulated large stockpiles.
---
Cork has a few more uses and can be obtained by scrapping some pipe weapons, so people might have a little bit more on hand - but realistically probably will flop as well.
---
The rest are more feasible. Wood is worth hoarding and is also easy to get by scrapping weapons or just picking from wood piles. Plastic and glass can be obtained by scrapping laser weapons, so we'll have enough if fallout 1st members have been picking up and scrapping weapons from all their West Tek runs: I'd put those two challenges as a "probably" to be completed. Cloth might not be too bad, and there's that event at the airport that gives 100 prewar money at the end: if everyone does that a few times between now and September we should be okay.
---
Leather is the most interesting one for me, particularly because the 50% off the purveyor would be very nice. A lot of the best sources of leather are animals, so it would be nice to have some events that spawn a lot of animals. How convenient that Meat Week is between now and the time we need leather!
---
Bwhahahahaha lolololol 😂😂😂
---
No you can, I tried. Had to swap to the Mothman Gas mask and paired that with the collar.
---
I would at least until the event goes live,l sometime this month, or find a good buyer and hope it’s just a trophy and not anything valuable. If it’s ever used for anything good it would probably be the event we’d see something come of it.
---
Could also just be a trophy, like the sheepsqutach skull
---
Yeah they make a sound like a demented giggle. The teddy bears have a giggle sound too. I cant remember specifically but Id say Mr Fuzzys do too
---
Someone needs a Snickers.
---
Double door walls weren't patched out, the ability to swap them to solid or windowed was. You can still manually place them. The best solution right now is to place a brick wall, destroy it with a flamethrower trap, place a second brick wall, and repair the first. As far as I know it only works with brick walls, but that shouldn't matter if you're wallpapering both sides (although if you have a corner, the exposed ends on the brick walls are kind of ugly). Luckily they are bringing back the ability to swap doorway walls... eventually.
---
I got them from the Watoga vendor bot after about an hour of server hopping
---
Totally agree
---
Nothing.... I stock actually good items.
---
100%
---
NO!!
---
You stay right there and you grind.
---
An atomic bomb might warm them up.
---
I never said that what you are saying is not true. I just said that people love berets so much that they put in extra effort to make sure that enough steel was contributed. They event went well over the requirement.
---
No, I did all steps in the same session until I got stuck.  Then, I tried leaving the game.
---
Wait did you shoot him?
---
Everyome tryin to get concrete for the BOS and im just trying to build a new CAMP.
---
Steel was cheap to get and people had tons in stashes but concrete doesn't have too many uses in crafting so people don't stash too mutch of it plus it has few static farmable locations so if we want to complete the challenge I think we will have to run workshops and camps at concrete deposits.
---
I put all my camp related plans and most mods out for 10c or less. Ive also been stocking consumable items like food for a couple caps ea for the sake of the daily quests so people can buy 3 somethings cheap
---
tbh I probably rob myself on most items I stock, even the "good stuff" but Im all about turnover
---
Do you know in which direction? I need acid.
---
I have a queasy feeling that I’m being set up for a joke lol um ... shoot who?
---
I play with my missus and we have some of the funniest stuff happen to us. We play together every night and tend to enjoy every moment, I've even gotten her confident enough to launch nukes now, which is great coz I was getting sick of doing it all the time.
---
One way to potentially fix is to server hop.
---
Literally just got one right now.
---
right! Idk if the Bethesda guys actually read this stuff but if they do I think that'd be a cool little thing to add in the next update/whenever they can
---
What is a cursed item?
---
It would of made siding with the settlers worth it.
---
Sounds like both of you are having fun :) 
---
*Cries in Lonesome*
---
I think they mentioned something in the most recent Q&amp;A that they are looking into setting up mannequins  to display clothing as well as power armor stands. So I guess we just have to wait and see.
---
I feel like I read it somewhere “not to worried if the requirement aren’t meant we will autocompleted them” but I can’t find it right now sorry
---
I don’t really play the game since the beta, I just like to study the dumpster fire that is fallout 76, I believe there is much to learn and even better, meme material.
---
Your best bet is to find a player to make you one. Most likely they'll do it for free
---
Or, hope you get lucky killing area leaders (crowned enemies), looting safes, looting end of 'dungeon' chests, or event rewards
---
It’s a new prefix effect that increases damage at the cost of durability. It’s only coming out for like 3 avg quality items, but it’s a safe guess that cursed items will eventually branch out to more than just the ones that have been in the PTS.
---
Should be more enclave outfits.
---
Even with FO1 I had 1k concrete... not gonna turn in 4 times to deplete my concrete and get no rewards
---
Do you even know what autistic means?
---
Is there any way i can view patch notes for the pts
---
Your camp looks really nice good job and I also do the sa,e! My camp is right next to 76
---
Aren’t they all legendary?
---
For some reason it completely slipped my mind that someone else who has those plans might be able to make me a basic level 20 Gatlin gun. I appreciate this comment :). I guess now ... I play the waiting game :D.
---
I totally missed the steel donation part because there was no quest for it and kept forgetting about it. Donated a bit today but I had a bitch if a time remembering were ATLAS even was at.
---
Well technically  your ally you can put clothing on them including armor so l. It's pretty much the same thing
---
Thanks man. That's what I ended up doing, never realized I could do that before
---
oh damn! good to know thanks man! also hella noob question but how do you get the "lone wanderer" next to your name? I've been seeing all of them like the enclave, BOS ones and etc and have no clue how to add that to my profile I think its pretty sweet lol
---
There is indeed a 'giggle' when you pick up the gnome. But it is not a sound that you are 'hearing'. Rather, the gnome is hacking your mind and conveying that giggle telepathically. Once the seed has been planted in your mind, you will slowly go mad until all you can hear are gnome giggles. 
---
Run! Run! Run and don't blink!
---
I dont think so, I've found some none legendary level 65 ones
---
Pretty sure it a public teams bug. I've had similar and even contradictory options available at the same time. It shouldn't affect what you actually do though.
---
Fuck it and do what I did and run every mutation you can since beta
---
I think your point that it is "not ideal", could have been made by using other words.... that is actually quite offensive. Please understand how that is a hateful way to say that.
---
Appreciated, :)
---
yeah you can but say I find a cool item and I already have my ally wearing some clothes? id want a mannequin too to put it on! def a good way to go lol I currently have the commander daquerre as mine and I have her only wearing a bandana lmfaoo
---
All CAMP plans and recipes
---
Wait marine tactical helmet is 3k I sell those for 100
---
I sell all my plans for 10 caps because I don't need them, can't sell them to robots, don't need caps, and can't be bothered pricing them. Also, it's really cool to show up to someone's camp and find a plan you need for cheap
---
I don't see it.
---

---
Here’s info on the cursed stuff. If you look up PTS patch notes 21 FO76 on google you should be able to find them. Since colossal problem was supposed to come out last week, most of those PTS patches came out last update. But still some helpful info that other resistors should have posted!
---
Fusion cores and plans/recipes.
---
Oh, that makes sense. I'll re-run the quest solo and see what happens. Thank you!
---
Is it that common? I’ve never seen it at any vendor ever.
---
And it may be, ive though about gettinf it but it still stands that they are chargijg for sum stuff that would have been standard in any other non mmo fallout game
---
Lol I put it in a display case and put “Colossus Ain’t Shit” in small letters
---
And then he came to my camp and emptied his gun on me and I just gave him ❤️ emotes
---
If you look at the top right hand corner of the screen, you will see a box titled 'About community'. At the bottom of this box there is a drop down menu called 'Community options'. Click to see the drop down options and one of them will be 'User flair preview and will have a pencil icon to the right. Click that to change your Flair.
---
Dunno I just found the blueprint and make the helmet and sell em
---
That it does, it has the most welcoming community I've ever experienced in a game hands down
---
Yeah the concrete and cork challenges are horseshit.  I'm the kind of clownface that picks up almost everything and at 150k steel I'm less than 4k concrete and under 1k cork.
---
The apparel trader also spawns in the Small Camp (the destination for Photo Opportunities).
---
I’ve gotten so many that I just throw them into the script machine or sell them to the robots. 
---
I’ve gotten 3 star vampires. Instigating. Furious. Bloodied. Mutant. Ghoul slayer. Troubleshooter and WAY too many hunters.
---
Or like, just make passive mode a no PvP mode and give us team PvP back.
---
Thats fair, it still seems as though they don't really listen to what the majority of fans ask for and some of these bugs have gone unfixed for a long time
---
But mannequins don't constantly complain about 'headaches'..... at least *most* of them don't.
---
I’ve been looking at every vendor that google tells me to look at, and can’t find them. Watoga seems to be the popular answer, but I’ve yet to find it sold there.
---
It’s simply for clicks.  Someone who wants to enjoy shitting on FO76 would click it, someone who wants to see Grounded would click it, it’s as simple as that.  Just ignore it and move on with your day, no sense in getting mad about it.
---
you actually just made my night thank you for the help!!
---
lol And Lorespade isn't wrong about this just getting down voted and hated on by literally 95% of redditors on these forums. This community is toxic.
---
Excellent! Nothing is better then letting someone waste their ammo on you. Especially when you don’t care.
---
You can have a meta build for PvP by level 70 and wreck all levels. Levels don't really matter.
---
CORK,  so better start to stockpile it now 😆
---
Wrong. It is build based. A level 15 can wreck a level 1500 that has all QOL cards.
---
I get on once a day for the Score... and this is the first im hearing about Cork and concrete. Ive only seen that they wanted Steel and donated 500..But I don't know what it actually does
---
You might be aware already, but to farm ally spawns, you can go to Hillfolk Hotdogs in the forest and head southish along the edge of the river. NPC encounter spawns everywhere
---
I got like 5 or 6 of them during week, only one was good
---
I've had a Red Asylum outfit in my vendor for 5000 caps for a week now but no interest. Am I asking too much or just not getting lucky with visitors?
---
Yeah, I ran into that as well, was surprised since I basically passed all checks (bloody build with full unyielding, so had high stats).
---
But I had done everything solo.
---
As long as you select the correct options for your choices and complete the corresponding quest options too you can ignore the flavour chatter and character comments.
---
Its a closed discord, I cannot invite anyone or are allowed to take screenshots.
---
I’ve had no luck on that route thus far. Maybe I’ll try it again though
---
This shit weights 5lb tho, to much imo
---
I forgot this subreddit was full of dorks that have never been laid in their life.  you can't have an opinion that doesn't match. you must bow down to any Bethesda game ever created
---
I've just started dropping my fusion cores. I think I got rid of like 20 full ones yesterday. I hate having them in my vendor cause of all the stash space they take up. Even if I sell them for like 75 caps, it's just not worth the 1.5k caps I can make off water in an hour
---
Facts! I have terrible awareness. So many deaths cuz I get bored waiting for the other person to show up on radar and just start dancing around. 😂
---
Add it to the bug list then! xD
---
I wish you the best of luck! It only took me 2 servers to find her, so I got very lucky
---
Mega bruh moment
---
Did you mean "No you can't, I tried"? Because your second sentence leads me to believe that was a typo
---
Same, I also try to keep some addictol and stims stocked as well
---
That's cool you nerds have screen names like Raiders and  Grafton. You guys probably dress up cosplay while you're giving each other rimjobs fuckin fags
---
All ammo is 1c. If I'm giving it away, I go toss it in a suitcase at the train stations.
---
Almost all Legendaries I sell at face value regardless of what they are. Sometimes, I can't keep it stocked because it sells immediately. Other times, they sit for a while. I lower my price, and if it still sits, it gets scripped.
---
Plans are 5 to 50c. Mostly 5-15c. I'm pricing to get rid of them. I make a little bit here and there and it does add up. They move quicker at lower prices.
---
Most Chems are half price or less. I sell most at 10c.
---
I always keep my Punch Bowl and Keg full of free drinks. (No Nukashine. I've got one or two in my inventory as it is. I have plenty of whiskey and wine though.)
---
And my camp is unlocked and free for use. I pretty much only Lock the Collectron when there's a special event (Santatron, basically.) Free junk, free water, free crops.
---
Plans. I sell pretty much all of my known ones at 1 cap. Rarer ones like fixer plans I won’t, but the common ones I already know don’t benefit me sitting in the stash, and other players who don’t know them could benefit from them.
---
Whoaaaa, far out
---
In F4, I used a mod to increase the settlement budget, but otherwise was never prevented from building the way that I wanted. In 76, I spend 90% of my build time trying to get around red restrictions.
---
While it would be great if they had designed an entirely new build system when they were creating fallout 76, they did not do that, and they are unlikely to do that as far as I can imagine. They could however fix the red restrictions so everyone has more freedom to build.
---
Agreed!  This has to be the most annoying bug in game.  Nothing makes me want to rage launch my controller into the Telly like having to attempt fast travel a half dozen times - every fucking time!
---
That cool down drives me nuts. lol
---
There isn’t even a time left on public ones. But it definitely should be implemented. It would have to be a “time left on ___ objective until event fails,” or if it doesn’t fail from objectives then just a time left
---
It's be nice if it could queue us up immediately to launch into another game upon quitting spectator mode, instead of back to lobby
---
Yes! Especially when fast travel is needed to join events. Makes my ears bleed
---
"People love berets!"
---
(Tom Hanks wears a beret once)
---
beret is all that is hat
---
I can't even begin to tell you the stuff I got rid of by selling to the Train Station vendors before the Purveyor update. There was so much good stuff but I didn't need it. Or I didn't have enough stash space.
---
All the Legacies. We were so young and didn't know yet.
---
I’m grinding my teeth just thinking about it!
---
Isn’t spec = build?
---
Because it resonates with people. There are alot of people that feel fo76 really isnt a good game,(like myself) so they hook people in with that time read it. Like a "hey this article agrees with me, I better read it to see what else I agree with"
---
Glowing meat piles, PC mod. All my meat piles glow bright neon violet, impossible not to see.
---
Good
---
A Gatlin gun right? Not a mini gun. If you know where you can buy the plans I'll buy and make one for you. I have nothing to spend caps on at this point so I might as well buy the weapon plans I dont have
---
FFS I'm still mad that I accidentally scraped my Urban Scout Mask, at least I have the Plague Doctor for now
---
If NW were out of beta I'm sure they'd make it less steep of a learning curve. No doubt in a few years it will be like that. Other MMOs that were more challenging at first would get easier and easier over the years, I think
---
Lol Flatwoods is cool cuz of Alpine Cabins
---
(todd face)
---
(gnome laugh)
---
Wes Tek &amp; Whitesprings are possibly the two best XP farming locations. Just gotta get there, nothing else you have to do
---
Your inventor friend tells you to start recording with your prosnap camera so he can talk about his flux collecting and he gets killed by a level 95 deathclaw in the middle of it.
---
This is the only bug that really pisses me off. It was happening nearly every time for me but it's been a little less lately. There's no rhyme or reason to it, either. No discernable pattern that I can tell anyway.
---
*can't
---
* plans for 9c and ammo for 1c
---
* the ammo generator is set to shotgun and unlocked as are the water purifiers
---
* if I have enough free space in my stash I will make lvl5 mod'd out lvl5 weapon and put those in for cheap.  (if you make them free some dumbass will take them all)
---
My bad, it's late and I'm tired.
---
if they are 90% or higher I vend them for 40c but otherwise I dump them
---
Same, im fine with ss chest and combat bos limbs.
---
Wipe the area, load out and repeat?
---
All be does have a shared pool of 1400 caps per day. Use to be there were 7 different be for factions that each had 200 caps but they combined the cap pool limit into one across all vendors for convenience
---
There is only the shared 1400 vendor cap pool per character. Just like scrip
---
There is an infinite amount of caps that can ge earned via events, enemies, quests, stashes, etc
---
But 40caps for 3lbs of stash space?
---
other than the fixer plan, I don't really know what is rare so I'm sure someone has happily paid my cheap price for them!
---
I disagree. If I’m running West Tek for XP I don’t want to pick all the mutants’ crap up automatically and get overencumbered. If it were a perk on the other hand you could equip it when you run West Tek for steel and it would be awesome
---
At this point we have better equipment than the brotherhood
---
Even just a cheaper option for people that don’t really care about the superficial stuff. I spend way too much time organising junk into what I want/don’t want. I’ve never done much with my camp either since I’ll just move it on a whim anyway haha!
---
Or Uranium Fever, about half the steel but black titanium too.
---
I suspect this may be true. I also wonder about past community events (scorched, scorch beasts, etc). If we fail, it will probably demand questions about actual 'active' user numbers that they will want to hide from the public / inflate for the public.
---
Dude "Chally Oop" was right there
---
Because of modus and the continuity of government bunker. We already know that they're going to end up at Raven Rock and that modus has been in contact with the zax unit that becomes John Henry Eden.
---
Interesting idea! Would be nice to see whitesprings be remodeled completely
---
Meh, people filled their junkbox and canceled FO 1st,this is a scam to make those junkboxes empty again for people to reactivate their sub.
---
They're aware of the bug and apparently there's a temporary fix if you have access to a private server. But otherwise who knows. I'm lvl 41 from running around doing all the side quests while I wait for them to respond to my ticket lol
---
I found that the glowing ghouls in morgantown seemed to have a lower drop rate for stabilising materials, may have just been that when I did it I got really unlucky, but compared to higher level areas, the rate I was getting stabilising materials per kill was abysmal. One cool thing about Morgantown though, is if you hit the airport and go and start the Collision course event, the scorched waves that spawn in are all level 68 and they have a chance to drop the materials too.
---
It’s the brotherhood Vendor in Watoga. He’s also in whitesprings but I only look for plans and such on Private servers since otherwise people have likely bought them. Its a hefty cap price though. I don’t get why the game has such high Cap prices when it gives so few caps. Especially since they NERFED the cab stashes a long time ago before I ever even got to try em,  aside from the daily 1400 from vendors if you even have a character strong enough to farm whatever route you need for that, I don’t know how people are making such a ridiculous amount of caps aside from player to player trading. One day we will have an auction house eh?  lol one day.
---
Yep! They have a fun track record of every tool of theirs not actually working when it really needs to (e.g. their ticketing system revealing personal information about customers).
---
Yes, might be able to level up once per run at lower levels with no XP boosting items
---
At higher levels with no XP boost it is about half a level per run
---
I would actually participate if they were giving flux mats as rewards.
---
Maybe they are accounting for the fact that other console players will dupe anything and everything. So it would only take one weapon getting out. I had never seen a JE gat plas in my 1000+ of playing until a couple of weeks ago. Throw a rock now and you'll hit three people sitting on 5 each. Who knows, maybe that genie would never leave the bottle. I rather doubt it though. 
---
Also, in 5 minutes I was able to find 3 videos showing hacked weapons. It's not hard to find proof.

---
Got all the gauss weapon and plasma caster and t65 this set is the last thing i need is it worth it
---
I just hopped on the discord for this sub and asked someone who had the recipe to craft if I supplied the mats, it didn't take long to find someone.
---
Plans and recipes are at 10% of their value, so around 5-50 caps. 
---
Though all mounted plans are at 1 cap because they are easy to obtain. 
---
Once i use the ammo convertor, I just drop the excess ammo in my camp.
---
Listen, I don’t have much time to explain but beware of the
---
I don't have 1st, but I wasn't very far so I just made a new Char
---
Why should I?
---
If you want to see it we can add and ill show you, don't get me wrong thinking ill crash servers on purpose. I just like to test things out and whats possible. I'm not the douchebag who crashes random servers on purpose funking up others, Bethesda screws wit us enough.
---
Healing factor mutation
---
I hope you guys have many Wasteland dates like this to come :)
---
If it helps even a 3* dragon isn't worth much over on the market sub. Even though they are legacy, they just arnt practical
---
That blasted assaultron head
---
Ironically they already do have a knockoff version of set bonuses. How many people do you see running around in Thorn or Solar armor? Strangler Users are even kind of lessening after the nerf.
---
How much is it? I figure with a high karma and the vendor perks like 3k
---
Sounds amazing
---
I have no idea what this is lol can someone explain? A *happy* liberator?..
---
Good day fellow human, I am u/CafePancake telling you everything is ok. And don’t forget to take all the gorgeous and sexy gnomes to your CAMP.
---
Hoarder here.  150k+ steel and less than 4k concrete.  Bethesda clearly doesn't play their own game.
---
Yup, 3K is right. Its up there lol
---
You can get cork from golf balls! I use to collect all the golf balls at the various golf clubs for plastic so it’s like an added bonus. While the cork one will still be a pain I feel like not enough people know about golf balls.
---
I would like a separate server with separate characters and no legendary gear. This would have open world faction pvp, no silly restrictions, no damage cap,  just missions much like you have suggested and faction bonuses depending on the amount of territory held.  All dailies/weeklies could be done in this mode or in Adventure meaning that anyone who joined this would have absolutely no excuse to complain about being killed in pvp since they would had to have purposely joined it.
---
That would be great too
---
OP may be legit and just not use reddit
---
You spawn somewhat north of your camp module, replace it and hop to your camp for test
---
they sell quick.  almost never have in 'in stock'.
---
Right but sometimes, it happens every single time I try to fast travel. Other times, it's once a session, or even not at all. The frequency is super unpredictable.
---
Ouhkay thank you guys
---
There are actually concrete nodes you can set extractors on scattered around the world and at some workshops.
---
I have something in each category at an absurd price just so all the categories light up
---
If you bought it from the atom shop, it should be available for all your extra characters on that account to craft
---
Endgame still sucks, time gated grind on maximum annoyance with lack of activitys to do except the same challenges and scorchbeast Queen along the dalie farm hassle. Bethesda purposely creating one shitstorm after another funking up late game or housing essential things.
---
Wastelands update has a decent story, worth for about 5-10h playtime.
---
Best place to nuke is so that forward station delta is just out the zone. Use delta to fight queen, then hit up the rail yards, forest, and then the other BOS camp to get flux and flux creation materials. 
---
Why drop half the nuke off the map? Makes no sense
---
I love this so much. Fallout has been our (my wife and I) thing since fairly early in our relationship. She likes to play "spotter" for me. She knows sometimes I get so focused I'll miss bodies/items or not notice my health dropping and remind me to stim. But when I'm not home or I just don't feel like playing she LOVES to just pick up the controller and explore. Every once in a while she'll knock out a mission or two. 
---
Wish I could get us another Xbox or her a laptop or something (I have a desktop) so we could play it together but for now we love our current set up (this isn't the only game series we enjoy together but it's certainly the biggest one).
---
Other tips for getting past cap limit ?
---
Thats not bad. Are you gonna be on in like 30-45 minutes? Come swing by my camp and I'll make you one. Would you rather have the gun or the plans to make it? I'm not sure if its locked behind a gunsmith perk is why I ask. My ign is icorndawg
---
The Burrows is also a decent area that people tend to ignore.
---
Quick FYI, you don’t have to go to the fissure site for pumpkins. There’s two behind the pickup truck, two behind the garage, and more on the hillside to the East.
---
Same
---
If you have a collectron it gathers 'trash' like bones and fertilizer. 
---
I had been leaving them in a pile beside the tron until I got enough plastic to start bulking and selling.
---
Hmm might just be my camp location or something
---
Atomshop content is account wide, every character should have the plans learned. The nixie tube is in the light category with the floor lights.
---
Oh my god I fucking feel you man!! I’ll give her a headache to complain about!
---
Oh that's a good idea. I try to have enough to pull people in, I'll add a couple things
---
Worst idea ever......
---
It is necessary to buy the plan from a vendor bot as well as buying the item from the Atom shop. Vendor bot Phoenix used to carry it, but it seems that this was moved to a brotherhood bot in the Whitespring creekside lodge.
---
This is so wholesome! I hope she decides to stay with us. Appalachia needs new blood, and it will be easier for her to really dive in if she has the support and protection of a default teammate lol
---
Lol... you know its Bethesda right? Its not hard. I've had several.tell me how to achieve it.
---
Five characters = 7000 per day. So 150k caps total.
---
What does the big do? Haven’t encountered it yet
---
Almost everything grants caps. Scorched earth gives 200 caps.
---
If you want fast money try to sell rare stuff at your camp vendor for cheap prices. My go-to item to sell is antibiotic and healing salve, both are easy and combined farmable but consumes the same flower.
---
No!!! Start walking.
---
It worked. You shared their link.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Bish Bash Bosh
---
I loved being a shotgunner... until around level 30. 
---
Up to that point my combat shotgun just melted everything in 2 shots, but once enemies started wearing armor it started requiring 4-6 shots per kill, even with shotgun perks. 
---
I nabbed a 3 star super sledge, started respeccing towards melee and never looked back! 
---
Now I use plastic exclusively for bulking purposes.
---
That would be cool if they don't eat a ton of camp budget.
---
I have the living mannequin, though. Raider Punk is currently cosplaying various Unstoppables characters. He has the nerdy enthusiasm for it and he doesn't bitch about nightmares and headaches.
---
Pc sorry
---
I didn't think it had any mods.
---
If your on xbox i could mod it for you but you will have to provide or pay for materials
---
Same here. Heard it happened during the quakecon wedding colossus, but I didn't know what to look for so I missed it
---
no, happy liberator
---
It's heavy stuff, so unless you are needing it for a specific task like building... it tends to get passed over for more useful items.
---
I'd rather there be a loot area function. It's annoying having to switch cards a million times a day.
---
Or make make non combat cards always passive.
---
I just server hop at the abandoned bog workshop. I don't bother traveling anywhere else because there's so many there, but it worked a decent amount
---
Yeah seriously. How do you people find concrete ?
---
They didn’t go to Raven Rock until after the fall of Navarro, which happens over a century and a half after 76. I doubt they’d go there earlier than they’d even left the damn oil rig to land in California.
---
Honestly am I a bad person for not even going to the observatory? I just don't wanna give up my junk
---
Yes. I believe scrapper.
---
Damn, so you're telling me I spent 95 caps for a mod, for a weapon that cant be modded?... aight.
---
Sell stuff to the vendors. I don’t mean other players. I mean whenever you kill enemies pick up their weapons, then go to a train station and sell those weapons. 
---
Each day the robot has 1,400 caps. Meaning you can sell him meat, weapons, clothes, armor, junk. To make some caps. 
---
Unless you have REALLY good legendary weapons or armor for sale that are max level. Don’t expect people to shop too much from you. 
---
There’s a perk under charisma called hard bargain. It makes buying and selling things much better. Obviously level 3 card is better.
---
What does this bug even do?
---
I'd rather not have to dig through perk cards for another reason.
---
Just make them glow by default.
---
Glassed Caverns.
---
It would be cool if they could hire a developer and get all these things fixed in a few minutes rather than cycle through free interns who have no idea what they're doing and go back to school by the time they figure out how to check out code.
---
Tbh my hole experience so far is pretty bug free. I play the game for about 3 weeks now and just has 2 DCs and one questbug that solves itself with a relog. Maybe it’s a hardware thing. I play one PC and have a pretty high end Maschine.
---
More like the only good thing.
---
They're so boring.
---
That's how you know it's not truly tracked and the tracker is arbitrary at best.
---
I mean, hell, they can't even fix the VATs issue.
---
Curious about this as well.
---
I have it. I like it. Can't be modded.
---
First slot I don't care since I don't bother to keep multiple sets around but one piece is always Chameleon.  AP refresh is the most important for me.  Other effects I like are 2 pieces negating fall damage and Agi, Per, or weapon weight reduction.
---
i personally dont care about damn cosmetics. i donated steel to get plans i didnt learnt and some caps to buy every plan from vendor bots. no i have like 25k caps and i have no idea what i can buy...
---
Plans for 1c, ammo for 0-1c, and trash legendaries for 10-100c. Because caps mean nothing to me anymore and I need my stash cleared the fuck out.
---
This isnt a game id play to get deep into. I only would play it now if I wanted to smoke up and explore a world high as fuck.
---
I had no spawns today during a run except the ones that are initially there.
---
I believe they are planning to add it with Steel Dawn OR sometime else in the future, not sure but it’s definitely being added
---
There's a lot of foodbuilds on this subreddit. Any mention of PvP gets downvoted, sadly.
---
Also decent caps.
---
i was doing my one-two-three punch of score challenges...  
---
claiming tyler dirt track and doing the leader of the pack event.
---
gets me a workshop claim, event completion, and unless i end up having to share the event, three legendaries
---
some idiot tried to contest the workshop and skedaddled before i came back.  i server hop once i have my claim in and i get enough defend events, so i don't hog the easy claim.  this day though i had to kill a deathclaw too, so hopped over to the island and saw the guy who tried to contest me needling the deathclaw with a popgun.
---
he was still showing as an enemy, so i killed him.  hooooooo boy his loot drop.  more bulk than i cared to try and keep track of.  tons of it.  15x bulk ballistic fiber alone.  it felt like scrapmass.
---
Not for heavy gunners.
---
Weapons weight reduction duh
---
There's a whole thing with going around and killing these gouls with beeping backpacks, then figuring out how to decode it.
---
It's all explained by Mobius, but it's been a while since I heard it and I wasn't paying that much attention.
---
This is awesome!!!
---
Nah. It would be nice though. 
---
Or at least I think it would be, I feel like I would just get more spears only good for killing super mutants during the day and only when I’m withdrawing from drugs. Already got plenty of those.
---
Go buy serum plans.
---
Then upvote it
---
Lol nice!
---
I think it updates daily, probably when the dailys change
---
Thank you for the confirmation! I appreciate you saving me $20 :)
---
Why?
---
i don't think there are any mods for it.  not all weapons have mods.  like the black powder pistol.
---
Flair checks out
---
Marsupial 
---
 Bird Bones and Adrenal Reaction about equal for me in second place
---
I crash every once in awhile and I have seen a few but only one that made it unplayable. Not an exaggeration either. Every time I looked in a certain direction my screen blanked. Looked away it was normal looked back then blank. Had to reset
---
Yup, concrete will fail, cork will fail.  Plastic will be interesting.
---
Will the F1 people who farm Westek all day have a billion plastic from scrapping laser guns or not?  If not, it's a fail too.
---
That ain't bad man.  I'll up that
---
Same here. Done that thing 50 times, 47 White Fedoras, 1 Sheepsquatch outfit, 2 respawn bugs that resulted in me not being able to loot the corpse. 
---
Screw this dumb event.
---
I have a dope gauss rifle on my rifleman build just WAITING for vats to be fixed.
---
We exist but the harassment is real.
---
How do you make a Brahmin launcher?
---
Happens also without the mutation. The problem is how the hp are calculated, which may result that the game is removing the overheal which count as damage (this is why healing factor is broken).
---
Also sometimes the server can't let you fast travel since your location get lost during the fast travel process, means that the server loose your location. Updating the server status will fix it, like taking damage, walk a few steps or consuming something.
---
Yep.
---
I agree. I donated over 60k steel. I only had 2k concrete. I don't even have half that much cork. Plastic I use heavily for shotgun ammo so I wont be giving any of that. Cloth and glass will be like steel, leather maybe half that but still doable.
---
&gt;I now need to know exactly what and how much ammo I have to actually spend less time than before
---
You do not.  But keep pretending you're so hard done by.  It's hilarious.
---
If you select a thing to fast travel to and confirm it will just back out to the world and you have to repeat the process 3+ times till it actually works and you fast travel.
---
...I did. :P
---
There's no reason for twisted muscles if you aren't melee.
---
Today I got an Assassin's Gauss with the second prefix concerning VATs and I could've cried.
---
Also bring cannibalism back😈
---
What's the mod? I didn't think that it had any
---
Herd mentality with the new team system.
---
I would want to see a fo3 style gauss rifle and it would be easy to just port it but would be cool if they changed the laser musket crank to a much better and much satisfying cryolator reload animation and loading animation
---
Oh wow. I've been hearing a lot of people complain about this but in all honesty I haven't experienced this.. maybe I've just been lucky
---
I did this too.  Tbh, pa heavy gunner isn't even viable early game for so many reasons.
---
Lol I'm jealous it's so frustrating
---
Are we still doing this? Donated 1k steel and that was enough of that "event"...
---
I hate berets... but I donated steel because I get thousands of it without trying. I have to try to get concrete which is why I don't have a fancy base
---
There are a lot of similarities. Heck even the base building looks like the one from fallout 4/76. Survival, crafting, a strange open world, different enemy types like huge bugs and so on.
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
Haha this makes me laugh.  I think, personally, it's reasonable.  I also think this is a stab at the dupers out there.  They duped weapons, ammo, outfits... But no one hardly duped scrap.  Especially cork and concrete.  Just remember... Cement bags and golf balls, that's all u need 😉
---
Idk about this other comment, the game is so much fun and I have a blast. There is still bugs and such but overall it’s a great game and the best online community you could be a part of. I’ve always disliked online multiplayer games because everyone seems to be elitist assholes that make the game hard for newer players, but I got this game when wastelanders came out and multiple high level players dropped gear, plans, and weapons for me within the first couple hours. There’s a grind once the story is over to get the end game gear which some people dislike but it’s really not that bad. I love just making crazy camps and trying out the small events that no one goes to and hopefully get a rare drop, also I could spend hours exploring the map and have random legendary sheepsquatch or a mothman attack me in the woods lol. It’s definitely worth checking out in my opinion
---
They're like "it's just cork, how hard can that be"
---
And also they are literally hell bent on out Destinying Destiny 2, which is even more troubling.
---
This has given me new inspiration. What an awesome idea!
---
If you’re on PC, use Z or C to rapidly decrease large amounts of material you want to sell or turn in.  You can also hold WASD or the arrow keys for similar effect.
---
I cackled the whole time because of her scare attack / panic emote 🤣🤣🤣
---
I hide three machines in my camp, as a reward for people who take the time to look around. A small kit of health items in the bar, a machine with all the plans I get hidden amongst the crops on the roof, and a secret bunker you drop into from the roof that has an adventure kit with a 1-star legendary, underarmor, some type of rare hat and a treasure map. 
---
I don't have to grind for any of these items so it's zero effort for me, but people really get a kick out of finding them.
---
It's setup to use the Shielded Lining that is available (and working) on the regular variant
---
The ESM shows:
---
Armor\_Underarmor\_SecretService\_Uniform "Secret Service Underarmor" \[ARMO:0059766D\]
---
&amp;
---
ATX\_Armor\_Casual\_Underarmor\_CamoSecretService\_Uniform "Camo Secret Service Underarmor" \[ARMO:005B672D\]
---
Are almost identical.
---
Both have the same keywords:
---
ObjectTypeUnderarmor \[KYWD:0016E84B\]/BlockSuperDuperPerk \[KYWD:0043C439\]/NonPlayerTradable \[KYWD:00499F7A\]/**ma\_UnderArmor\_SecretService \[KYWD:005A4DCE\]**
---
Both use the same Attach Point Keyword:
---
ap\_armor\_Lining "No Misc" \[KYWD:00022821\]
---
The mod it self:
---
mod\_armor\_UnderArmor\_SecretService\_Mk5 "Shielded Lining" \[OMOD:005C5E2D\]
---
Uses attach point:
---
ma\_UnderArmor\_SecretService \[**KYWD:005A4DCE**\]
---
However the object template that can be found in the normal SS Under Armor is absent in the Camo variant. I think this is why it can't apply mods properly.
---
That or the one we create is the one NW uses. I can't seem to find out for sure but being NW weapons exist in Adventure mode I'd say it's a possibility.
---
The Raider Waster Under Armor **does** have the proper keyword to use Causal Linings.
---
ma\_UnderArmor\_Casual \[KYWD:0016EC04\]
---
Interestingly it too has the templates that are setup the same as the Secret Service Armor (it looks like they cloned a casual under armor entry for the Raider Waster Underarmor)
---
Laughs in healing factor
---
People have been asking for a while now and yes this is a must, even if its just for my self, i hate spawning at the back of my camp and having to jump over everything every time. I wish i could spawn in front and come into my camp as if i was actually coming home.
---
Serrated blade or something along those lines, I got it from the Watoga Station bot.
---
Oh Thanks!
---
Because 76 is still an awful, shitty game that needs to be constantly shat on because it deserves it.
---
No offense, but god this comment section is sad, nothing wrong with the commenters themselves, they had sound advice, but the fact that Bethesda made concrete so sparse that only like 10 bags can be found and that’s the only main way of getting them is pretty sad
---
already did. there are some plans for t45 and raider PA to buy but I have never used these PA. With t65 and excavator I am good. I guess when they get us some PA displays I will buy them all.
---
Which event requires you to enter 2 keycards simultaneously on different sides of a building? 
---
I've tried it a few times solo but was never able to run around to the other side quick enough.
---
No point buying it, you can't turn them in.
---
Hear me out imagine if we could fly those things haha 76 would just crash
---
The overgrown sundew grove next to fissure site prime has a respectable 60 count of fluorescent, but it's also easily the most plentiful flux that can be farmed at White Spring.
---
what were the effects of the gun?
---
Agreed to get any kind of decent PvP in this game legendary effects have to not exsist.
---
I was just doing the quest on my mules yesterday evening and it worked flawless on a public server.
---
Wouldn't she be hostile to the raiders if she haven't got to level 20 and given them the vaccine?
---
Brahmin launcher?.. i needa group with u guys when Free Range pops up
---
I don't think I've ever seen one but that's pretty frustrating!
---
Here lies the banned 12 year old who thought he was cool for cheating at a video game.
---
i'm pretty sure it's a reference to golden axe
---
You can use stimpacks in the fire, they don't get canceled like they do from player damage.
---
If you really want it sold, i'll take it for half that lol.
---
Absolutely 0% chance I would donate screws. Or ballistic fiber. Always running out lol
---
Wdym, My friend dropped me about 20 yesterday, and all I had to do was pick them up one at a time to turn them in.
---
serrated blade mod is a thing i think
---
I'd love to see if you wanna dm me the pics!
---
Low levels don’t have much good junk. Mid levels are smart enough to stash junk when the are in a workshop, and high levels like me will kill you and take your junk.....
---
Didn't even bother to check what the NW one was, but this was different.  Just hopped in and did it in a couple minutes.  Let myself die after.  My spectator target was a bush wookie, lol.
---
Management Approval:
---
So we want them to donate like 100,000 concrete.
---
100,000?
---
Yes...
---
That's nothing. Don't we have like 1 Million active players? In Destiny 2 they had to donate a billion fractaline!
---
But...
---
Make the concrete 10 times higher, no, 50 times! 
---
It's just a shitty emblem....
---
Do it now! Todd's on my back again...
---
Well that sound like it sucks pretty hard! Haven’t encountered it yet, hopefoit stays that way
---
lol Commas would have helped me catch that is what spec meant. 
---
Gear tho only helps good players be better. If you don't have a PvP build, no armor or weapon will save you from someone who does.
---
Yeah why not just change the numbers to reflect the actual dates?
---
Isn’t every drop lvl 35 lol
---
What?
---
That is used for combat knife or machete.
---
we did
---
Faster movement speed when aiming
---
Explosive 
---
And something to do with vats but I can't remember
---
lol We have. That's what I'm saying.
---
Like the legendary that drops is lvl 35. Why do people spawn camp so much? I see high lvl players do it a lot too.
---
Just sounds like you're bad at playing the game
---
🙃
---
Happened to me today. I left wayward and went back in. Go back upstairs and it should have fished it- at least it did for me.
---
See above comment about people being twat waffles :/
---
PC. Got it on Steam.
---
I think if they did this players who think PvP builds rely on legendaries would actually learn about the importance of SPECIAL cards. 
---
I've absolutely crushed players with stock weapons and no armor.
---
I don't wanna sound like a negative Nancy but i fear the worst might happen if they implement mannequins i feel as though players will find a way to steal my power armor or even worse a new way to steal my stash but here's hoping that doesn't happen , I mean I can make more but those cost resources
---
Instead of donating to BoS, can we kill that stupid guy and rob his giant pile of scrap****
---
I can be your friend.
---
I've gotten to the point of selling most of my legendaries for cheap just to make space in my inventory. Unfortunately with being able to only get so few scrips a day, it's my only option to make space since we can't scrap them.
---
They will not autocomplete but will put it in the atom shop and it will cost 150 atoms is my guess
---
I have never done monster mash with other people, its always solo. I never knew it was supposed to be pvp.
---
There are two things: patches and hotfixes.
---
One let you download data, the other updates the server data.
---
If we had to download stuff for our clients Bethesda will delay them for as long as possible since they have to keep all platforms on the same versions and Sony is charging huge cuts to update datas to the psn, microsoft is a bit cheaper as far I know. Thats the reason we only get updates once a month if they have anything to update.
---
If they tweak something on the servers, it can be done immediately since we don't have to download additional data. This is only possible for server data, since I didn't read anywhere that the deep pocket secret service limbs are datamined it could be possible they aren't in the game files yet, Bethesda could forgot to add it to the patch data. In this case its impossible to activate it trough a hotfix.
---
Esp wen folks don't share well in event areas. I have played w groups who gesture everyone over as soon as they see a Legendary and everyone takes one hit, and played w groups where one guy w his Big Gun will kill anything that anyone else looks at.
---
Things have got worse recently , something seems to have changed with many players mentality. ( probably an effect of SCORE)
---
It’s not just one violent night or uranium fever, guided meditation always seem to have a couple of campers now as does radiation rumble
---
Simp
---
Yup. Theres no structured events / challenges / BOS BS so people have to make their own fun and most pick chaotic evil &gt;:(
---
Until you put on your PA
---
Ah I see! Yeah uranium fever is very hit or miss.
---
with the new public teams, people seem to join just to pop around camps and check inventory.  be sure to join a public team if you can.
---
Then why are you on this sub?
---
I had a level 45 *** anti armor and recently got a level 50 *** anti armor from the purveyor after looking for it forever. It's my main weapon and I love it so much. I'm sure there are better out there but I have the most fun with it.
---
At the end of the daily "Someone to Talk To" in Monongah, you can drop bugged holos into the box. However, mine showed up again the next time I logged in.
---
It doesn’t matter which faction you choose to affiliate with.  You can still max your reputation with both factions and buy the reputation based rewards from both factions.
---
Thank you! I saw the ammo making machine and the Chinese stealth armor was locked behind the different factions and was worried I’d have to pick one or the other.
---
Lmao
---
Yeah until they make it relevant I only go shopping in it to play with the jetpack. I don't use it for anything serious.
---
go with both faction and when u have to choose one to get the last quest done go with raiders. search in utube how u can get 2 items while u r doing the last quest for them bcz it is only one possibility.
---
They have confirmed that it will.
---
They confirmed at the quakecon livestream that they are working on mannequins for armor and clothing aswell on power armor displays. But, sadly, nothing how further the development progress is or any date when it could get released.
---
The hilarious thing when I read this is I assumed you meant we had 4.65 Million left to go! The fact that it's actually 145 million left is just crazy.
---
Premarital gaming 😡
---
the only thing i wanted was this flag looks like thats not gonna happen.. what a great community. they go all in for it in the steel goal and now everyone says its not worth it and everyone basically abandons the event.... think of other people than yourselves.... \*sigh\* typical...
---
Firstly you'd be an idiot to try this with a full inventory of junk , and the rest is speculation. I've gotten some pretty good loot drops from lvl 15 to lvl 548 alike.
---
Its the best armor i have, so i either use it or no armor...i seriously need to look into the ss armor.
---
Low levels have the best junk and they need to learn sometime.
---
If you really want I think I've got a bunch. Could sell them to you at 10c a piece. (on xbox)
---
But like the other guy said there's not much point, you have to find them in the wild to turn them in
---
Cos Beth wants to introduce the missing mods one by one to simulate new content.
---
Maybe? When we first got there they weren't shooting at us. Even after she began shooting one of the raiders none of the others reacted except the one she was shooting. Once I killed him, a dog began attacking both of us, then killing that caused all the others to turn on us. 
---
It was my mission, and I've already completed wastelanders. So maybe it was just going based on me or maybe it was a bug I have no idea.
---
i bought each part for 10 caps more, so its fine
---
Ps4
---
Yeah I'm wondering is it not working because I'm only making lvl 40 Tesla rifles. I've scrapped another 2-3 since and have still not gotten it.
---
That's amazing. lol
---
Yes we are. It will probably be available on Tuesday's Atomic Shop update. You can check the progress of the challenges [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
I've been told to chill out many times during Monster Mash. 😂
---
My fight with wendigo collosus was hectic me and 2 other buddies decided to fight the queen no intention of fighting collosus we were just about to kill her then all of a sudden we heard giant footsteps and screeching. My friend "holy sh*t collosus is running up to the bunker!" as casual reaction we all screamed "were'll all gonna die!" So now we were forced to fight the collosus cause it kept screeching everytime the queen landed on top of it so we had to kill the collosus first and she kept spawning wendingo spawns like 6 of them and also the queen kept spawning her minions so it was all crazy eventually we killed the queen and wendingo but god damn that was the most fun I had in fallout 76
---
Ah okay. The raiders are pretty buggy sometimes to we'll probably never know for sure.
---
It's a "repurposed" liberator. Programmed to help on a mission.
---
I believe at level 15, Raider Armor (it might be hard finding level 15 PA.)
---
STALKERS?
---
Lowest level one is Raider PA at lv15.
---
No I don't think so think it was overall hit chance
---
Make sure you do Line in the Sand whenever it pops up. Also join a building team to boost the xp gains
---
I have all my stuff for super cheap... 10 caps or under I think. But nobody comes to my vendor so everything just sits there
---
Yes you do.
---
Agreed. I really don't get how devs from all companies screw these things up. There are so many other games out there to learn from. Every single MMO, Destiny, Anthem etc.
---
Yet devs make the same exact mistakes over and over. It's mind boggling.
---
I don't have 1st and I currently have 60 concrete in my stash to spare and 775/800 in my storage. Haven't stumbled upon any concrete yet while doing my dailies and my s.c.o.r.e. 
---
Dunno if I'll get around to donating. I didn't with the steel either lol
---
Did that really work? I had a stack of 20 or 30 at one point that I simply could not turn in. I ended up dropping it on the ground somewhere because I was tired of looking at it.
---
I practically give everything in my vendor away. And honestly... if you REALLY want it but don't have the caps, just shoot me a message. I'll absolutely give whatever it is to you free of charge. If it's in my vendor I'm not using it and don't plan on it. Rather see the item be useful to someone else. 
---
Just stop picking the lock on my scrap collector.
---
Idk man. I'd be happy with a BETA version of the original game just called Survival. Then we don't have to expect much from Beth cuz they already made it.  
---
Everyone is free game, camps included. Rewards EXACTLY the same as adventure so that the PvE players don't feel forced into the PvP servers and complain and get it nerfed all over again. 
---
And bounties for wrecking property. I missed all that. 😕
---
Sorry to ask, but would you be able to link the YouTube video? I’m not quite sure how I would search for it.
---
When I saw this post, I was really worried that it would be a picture of Ward. I am glad that I was wrong.
---
There's a Stealth Blade Cultist Blade you can get from mire and cranberry bog safes, but it's non Legendary, similar to lobber teslas but not as rare.
---
Also the Excavator PA starts at level 25
---
Ok thank you, and what are the levels of the following pieces? thanks
---
I came face to face with a legendary in Uranium Fever today. Saw it spawn and everything. First thing I do is do the follow me emote before hitting it with my knife. But before I could hit it some twat 1 shots it from over my shoulder.
---
Yeah you just have to drop the stack and grab them 1 by 1 then you should get the quest and you can turn it in, just dont grab the whole stack by accident.
---
I'm a sporadic player and I gave it a couple of hours collecting concrete. I didn't even make it to 250 concrete. Everyplace was already looted and empty even if I server jumped once.
---
150m concrete...Haha, yeah right... Guess the Brotherhood ain't coming to Appalachia..
---
We are a bad community because you don't get what you want. Okay 👌
---
Sure my gt is Silent Viper861, do you want to meet at ws station?
---
Nothing will fail. Calm down.
---
yeah that happens to me aswell on occasion, no turrets and no enemies lol, if its not a challenge should it even be in the game?
---
Then start farming....
---
I bought it on sale for $20 and have been enjoying it.
---
Personally, I would buy a game at full price if it promised to suck dick.  That's quite a bonus.
---
Tbh settlers are way better to side then the raiders.
---
This weekend I did two speed runs trough the fallout 76 sorry, and siding with foundation took way less time since almost all fast travel locations are used twice. Hornwright HQ an estate, robco and some other locations are used twice making it easier and faster to fast travel, also all locations are near already known from the basic Mainstorry like whitespring golf club or freddys fearhouse for the final mission next to abbys bunker.
---
Also the rewards are better, you get a pip boy paint and the stealthsuit which are both unique, where everything from the raiders is tradeable - slugbusters are worth less then 2k caps, only thing is the outfit which is rare imo.
---
Good tip 👍
---
T-45 starts at 25.
---
Wow...
---
Thus the whole asking Jesus might be the most probable way to get it fixed lol
---
I carry a .50 cal for backup. No other way to the Gauss shotgun but rep grinding with the settlers.
---
Yeah had that happen. I had a few lvl 5 completely modded out weapons and armor in my vendor along with a fair amount of ammo for them for 0 caps for new players (I'm just down the road from the overseer camp). Was sitting at my camp fire listening to the radio, enjoying a beautiful Appalachian wasteland afternoon, just waiting for an event I enjoy to trigger and watched a level 50+ go to my vendor and take all my free lvl 5 stuff. 
---
I don't do it anymore. Now if I notice a new player on the server I'll personally reach out if I have the resources to set them up.
---
Sure - so if I needed up to a couple of hundred cork, running around Whitesprings for a while might get me it. But we're talking about 200 *million* cork - which means *lots* of players need to be gathering cork. And unless I'm missing something about how looting world objects works, I suspect if lots of people start doing cork runs most of them are going to find that things have already been looted.
---
We get it when you donate one more lot of 250 concrete... ;)
---
He has no life to live.
---
I think it was Pete Hines who said they were surprised by the lack of interest in PvP, I doubt it will be making a return. Time to find something else.
---
From my knowledge, I think the friend dropping them has to have not started the BOS quest yet.
---
I think we have enough whine going on. 😉
---
I hoard everything I get and someone I was playing with for a bit gave me some but tbh this event is so shit I can't be bother spending the caps to fast travel to turn in any. (I don't have enough to make a dent anyway)
---
*You cunts ruined Christmas too be ashamed of yourselves.*
---
So you're mad at the community for not reaching the goal, and not mad at the Devs for setting an idiotic goal post?
---
I guess you'll just need to suck it up and deal with it.
---
Besides, they're gonna auto-complete it, even if they never outright say it.
---
It’s a really, really, really badly designed challenge. Like nearly everything in this game, those at the design helm don’t seem to play it and are incapable of scaling math.
---
I feel bad whenever I see these things because I was just like it before o actually tried it
---
Tbh I'm not too worried. I have a gut feeling we will still get the reward regardless, but maybe that's just me. Also it's worth noting that a lot of folks don't have anywhere near the amount of concrete stashed as they do steel
---
I have 30k steel in my scrap box as opposed to 500 concrete, it’s a much less abundant material...
---
He didnt drop them and me grab them 1 by 1 from there i dropped them after he gave them to me and then picked them up 1 by 1
---
 the only thing i wanted was this flag, looks like thats not gonna happen.. what a great community. they go all in for it in the steel goal and now everyone says its not worth it and everyone basically abandons the event.... and every cosmetic we dont get in the event  is going on the atom shop great........ \*sigh\* typical...
---
It is hard for me to get angry at this article. To be honest, I really like Obsidian as a company and really wish that they had been allowed to continue making fallout games (but I know that Bethesda owns the IP). I have much more faith in Obsidian than I do in bethesda now adays.
---
Shitting on bethesda in the article probably stems from the fact that Obsidian devs have stated multiple times that they would love to work on additional fallout project but bethesda has said 'no'. The anger is fueled by bethesda releasing half-baked games like this.
---
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy FO76 but I know that it is not nearly as good as it could have been if only the devs had the resources to make it better. I don't blame the devs themselves. Watching the Q&amp;As I could tell that they really loved the game and wanted to make it great. I blame the CEOs and CFOs who are only looking at the bottom line and allocating resources accordingly.
---
Sorry man. Thought I had a few hundred. Must have got tired of seeing them and sold them to a vendor haha
---
It's alright man, no worries.
---
Not really, you get the plan by scrapping one, and it was an “ultra rare” plan from mole miner even for some reason too :/
---
Normally I'd agree but I tend to have to wait 30-45 seconds for my base to even start popping in.
---
Thought it would be nice to just appear inside my base.
---
I just hit level 222 tonight and explored a location I’ve never seen. Still have dozens of unmarked places I’ve haven’t even touched too, I agree it’s massive !
---
If not a single player even donated a single item, we would get the items aswell. 
---
The progressbar on their website is static, it moves for a set amount on a set timer. Even when someone donate 100mil within 5h, the bar wouldn't move more then usual.
---
Its a hoax, as everything Bethesda does with fallout. 
---
Just imagine the community would fail such a event, what would it say about the publisher or dev team? No one is playing their shit or they can't calculate what their players are capable of. Either way, it would be a embarrassing sign for the team.
---
All the different stash box types are just different items that share the same storage, though I totally understand the confusion.
---
To be straight up I bought fallout first after a few weeks of playing (I was addicted right away) and you get an unlimited storage junk box. I think it should be  standard item personally. Although, I'm just a lowly consumer with some extra spending money.
---
Bulking is good like the other comment said. Before I got first, I just checked off things in my junk tab component view that I really needed. I always ended up dropping excess materials in a doggie bag outside my stash box though.
---
I don't think anyone ever duped cork and concrete ,honestly.
---
Iam with you on that, it's just both factions are a bunch of entitled assholes. Personally for me, the stealth suit is nice as an armored radiation suit, otherwise it does little for me. My objection of them stems from a role-playing perspective. Mind you, I did side with them. While the raiders could have been worse as people, they are still raider scum.
---
Yeah, my friends and I have just been nuking the area and waiting for the event. The nuke zone doesn't prevent it from starting, though it certainly doesn't help with FPS and lag related to meat piles.
---
Speak louder they can't hear you over the throb of all the ammo machines.
---
I spent 6 hrs last night farming Abandoned bog town because it has 3 cement nodes and only ended up gathering 750 ish.  1.5M is really unrealistic.
---
Add to it the number of folks sayin things like, "I ain't doing it, leavin it up to those w FO1st and their dupe buckets," like we don't just as hard to gather AND pay actual $ on top of it?!
---
Grrr. 
---
and yet I love this game...
---
Its expense but you got your self a deal
---
I just farmed for an hour and a half to donate 250 and got a couple plasma grenades, Molotov cocktail, bottle of wine and two bottles of vodka. Not even close to worth it.
---
Steel was easy, it’s everywhere in practically everything. Concrete is concentrated in a few locations and otherwise exists in one to two bag concentrations or as a handful of garden gnomes scattered across the entire map.
---
Safe to say they weren’t thinking this goal through
---
You would need to reset your world drops by picking up (I think) 180 different items in other places. So it's not viable to server hop to pick up world drop material. There's a common misconception that world drops of material are first come first served, but that isn't the case they are unique to you but there's a limit.
---
See here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where\_to\_farm\_all\_the\_things/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where_to_farm_all_the_things/)
---
Really? Like someone having 750mil of each cares if he donates 100mil to test out if the system works like the publisher says? 
---
Do you really think that dupers care at all for duped shit? They most likely won't donate a single resource since why making the effort to grab the shit and carry it over to an npc sitting in the wilds?
---
Ok thank you
---
I like V9 better because it has more flat space so  you don’t fall constantly into those ditches and also it’s easier to see the ankle biters.
---
But I also never drop on public so whatever.
---
You do know that the events page says right now we only have about 4 mil out of the 150 mil goal? The bar hasn’t moved all day long.
---
That would be great,if there wasn't a bug where when you verify game files,the game starts downloading from 0
---
There is probably less than 50% chance it will show up. And when he shows up, he will not last long and will either die or disappear despite your best efforts. But if he doesn't show up, when you tame your *next* animal then your previous one that didn't show up will suddenly appear at your camp - but untamed and untameable.
---
The taming system is so embarrassingly broken. I futilely try again with every patch in the hopes that just *maybe* it got better. It never does. It just gets worse.
---
I think people just get so crushed by more experienced players once or twice that they come down with what I refer to as Lone Wander-itis.  They're not used to not being the baddest thing out there, they don't understand why they're not, and they go back to what feels the most like the single player experience + friends.  So I like what was said about a no legendaries server so people can learn to make better builds.  There are entire guilds dedicated to that kind of educational experience in ESO so maybe another good idea would be to formalize player clans, and tie them to factions maybe.  It's not impossible people we just gotta sell the idea.
---
They were kids specifically.
---
We could recreate Hollywood in Fallout if they added mole miner pets
---
The stealth armour is meh.

Fallout 76 | Don't Miss Vault 79's Unique Legendary Weapon (Fallout 76 Secrets) 
---
put this in a search bar. i dont know if i can share a link here
---
NOT THE BEES
---
I want it. So I can make as many as I can in a large corn next to a seedy shed.
---
But I’ve seen people use it perfectly fine on YouTube and with random ppl
---
I call her mama mumbles.
---
Often these are made by agencies that want to capture a demographic. It might be that somebody saw 76 players as a demographic to target for their new survival game?
---
   Iirc, during the scorch killing events, the numbers weren't being updated during the weekend. 
---
   Even if this is not the case, I can see BGS suddenly jumping the number, claiming a last minute rush rather than looking like they don't have the player base they think they do.
---
No luck with visitors - I know a lot of people who'd pay five times that happily, and a couple of them would probably pay ten times.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who gets a kick out of torturing my NPC companions. I admire Beckett's dedication to keeping the bar top clean even when he's getting burned alive by multiple flamethrowers pointed right at him.
---
Third Admendment, I wonder fallout lore, they ever change the constitution? xD
---
I mean.. they aren't gonna upload the times when it doesn't work 🤷‍♂️ sometimes it works. Around 50% of my Mirelurk Kings and Deathclaws show up. All other creatures are far less successful. I've tried everything I can to try and find a rhyme or reason, and I can't.
---
Both the raider and settler questlines involve preparing to break into a vault: you can complete all the preparations for both sides and then pick one, so the only thing you miss out on is the final mission for the side you didn't pick. You actually get the plans for the stealth armor as part of the preparation quests, so you don't even have to side with the settlers to get that reward.
---
IIRC the only difference in terms of rewards is that if you side with the raiders for the final mission you have an opportunity to loot a semi-decent legendary plasma rifle, but it's not good enough for that to be the deciding factor. I suggest just picking whichever side you like the most.
---
There's no reputation hit to the other side you don't pick. Also, the game gives you a very big clear warning to let you know when you are about to make an irreversible decision.
---
BTW, you can decide to split the gold between the two factions, or to keep it all for yourself. Keeping the gold for yourself does incur a small reputation hit with the faction you ran the final mission with, but you'll max out reputation long before you have all the gold you could ever want, so it's probably worth it in the long run.
---
Don’t just focus on specific areas for XP - make sure you buff yourself to maximize that great area XP.  I’ll list a few, but I’m sure others can add to my list!
---
- Sleep: rested XP bonus 5%
---
- Food: Cranberry Cobbler 5%, with Strange in numbers perk 10-12% in group
---
- Perks: Inspirational 15% in group
---
- Mutations: Egg Head +6 intel = more XP
---
- Public groups:  pick building for the intel bonus which counts towards every kill, quest, and event.
---
- Quest: Path to Enlightenment 5%
---
I hope this helps - happy hunting!
---
Where did you go to find a mirelurk king?
---
Stealth armor isn't a faction reward, make sure you do all quests for both sides until you get the quest for both telling you to pick a side.
---
Use your scrap to repair all when you interact with your camp.
---
Cranberry glade
---
Just gunna save this post for later
---
Thank you so much! As stupid as it sounds, I was worried about missing out on something. And you don’t lose any reputation with the one you don’t side with? That’s good to know.
---
If you move your camp everything will be placed in your stored sectionnit was an easy way for me to rebuilt my camp
---
The game definitely doesn't need anymore MMO gated currency locks. Beth needs to learn more than just how to write, they need to learn how to design a meaningful game loop.
---
older players or grinders like me just sitting there at 1100notes, they should remove the time gate on everything from a start
---
You can still get the chinese stealth armor and side with the raiders.
---
Be careful leaving "I am become death" uncompleted if you frequent public groups. You might find it auto-completes by itself (unless they've patched it).
---
It's not a huge deal, as the silos have their own repeatable quests anyway, but seeing the quest complete all by itself is still upsetting for some players.
---
Thanks!
---
So what? Do you think they let us fail the event? I do not know at which frequency they increase the bar, but i know someone on a datamine discord posted a time-lapse video where he donated 100mil steel within a few hours and nothing changed the bar, even when it progrssed his donations were missed.
---
Slowly start by fixing your essentials, bed, stash box, tinker bench. Then methodically go through whitesprings and loot everything you can.
---
Your camp machine will tell you what you need, some materials can be bought from vendor.
---
It's quite a popular area for camps, I'm sure your neighbours wont mind you crashing in their beds or drinking their water for a while.
---
Sorry this happened to you. Whitesprings is quite a popular place to nuke so you may feel its time to move camp?
---
Also, have a little faith in the community spirit, when I see a camp with broken walls or damaged gun turrets, I fix what I can. I hope other people will do that for you.
---
I built this thing into the mountain i find it highly unlikely its going to be able to snap back into place
---
What is your ps4 name i could help you complete it if you want
---
38 and 10mm for free
---
It does not as far as I’m aware.
---
I haven't seen a repair all button anywhere.
---
*Introduces scout armor plans for GB*
---
Next time you connect to a server...
---
0. You should have both goals for "install fuse" &amp; "analyze sample"
---
1. Just install Type-T Fuse - **DO NOT** hit terminal 
---
2. Log out and join another server
---
3. Both goals would be reappeared
---
4. Install Type-T Fuse again
---
5. Open terminal and select "Analyze Blood Sample" - it should work by now
---

---
Well I mean if I could've duped junk i would've
---
I dont know why people get so greedy and douchey over public event challenges, they usually drop low level junk not worth fighting over.
---
Minimum level requirements can be found at https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_(Fallout_76)
---
You can start using the frame at level 1, but it's not until raider power armor at level 15 that you can put some proper armor on it. Realistically though it can be hard to find raider power armor in the world: I think for most players the most straightforward way to get power armor is to get to level 25 and then craft a set of excavator armor. IIRC you get given a set of Ultracite power armor as part of the Brotherhood questline, and the Enclave questline lets you unlock the ability to construct X01 power armor.
---
lets just stop lying to ourselves, hes right and we know it, bethesda showing it more and more every single patch. I wouldnt be even surprised if this year they ll pull out the plug
---
Not just WS, it's anywhere and everywhere for me. Takes the challenge, and enjoyment, down to zero when a courtyard full of mutants are just staring at me and pointing their guns. 
---
They'll make a half hearted attempt at melee attacking if you get close enough and most have no loot after being put out of their misery. 
---
No clue what causes them to lock up. I've seen 2 different kinds of paralysis bugs. Those that just stop attacking but are still moving (usually just spinning in place focused on you) and then the ghouls that are simply frozen as mentioned by OP. 
---
It's made for some interesting snapshots but aside from that, it's really annoying!
---
Shia and Turtles bot.
---
Alright then
---
It makes no sense that you have to either log off and out of a session, or spend time repairing everything, or move your camp because of a nuke launch. I'm up in the mountains east of whitesprings. I've never even been close to inside a WS blast zone before. This was either someone aiming for my base or he was way off the mark to nuke WS
---
I did both sides several times now with multiple accounts, low lvl chars aswell with geared high level ones.
---
Raider quests are time-consuming, like ra-ra's quest at grafton steel where a lot of scripted events which can't be skipped or Johnny's arena brawler quest. 
---
Tho I prefer the raider path, since its way more enjoyable, scripted and has better characters (♡ weasle)
---
Lol he just made it to my base
---
I used to give away ammo like 45 and 556, but then the challenge "buy" three items from a player vendor came along, and people would come, swipe all the free ammo, realise it didnt count, then separately buy three bullets of whatever ammo I was charging for. 
---
So no. No more free ammo for you assholes
---
Honestly they are too busy flooding the trade groups. Now that the ban waves are over and the glitch is passed. Those duped weapons are a ticket to anything they want. Including upcoming rare items and weapons or real money. 
---
My point being 99.9% dupers are lazy liars. Their may have been some good ones who actually did hand out free things to help the community. But most just did it for selfish reasons.
---
Unfortunately, no. The mafic effect triggers inly fir really high fire rate weapons and pellet weapons in VATS which seems to indicate rhar you need to hit the same spot really really fast for it to trigger and no Pistol can so that.
---
That being said, those weapons shouldnt rely on bugs to be viable options in the game so i really hope that Bethesda will rework Pistols, and shotgun if they fin magic bug.
---
and S'mores, don't forget nomnoms
---
Yeah everyone seems to be disappointed in dupers when it doesn't work directly in their favour. But only then, it seems. Otherwise, it's just "open the presents and enjoy! You won't get banned!" and this is no different. 😐
---
I cant be the only one with this issue but every time i log on 10 mins later the server becomes unresponsive and I get disconnected. Been happening all day for me today
---
Been saying this for a year. Go straight back to vault 51 after a game rather than to lobby. Then add some mini games to vault 51 for while you wait.
---
Can even add a gun range for people to practice.
---
&gt; And you don’t lose any reputation with the one you don’t side with? That’s good to know.
---
Nope. Just the opportunity cost of not giving them the gold, so you'll have to do a few more daily quests for them in order to max their rep a bit later.
---
Lmao this respawn glitch is back?
---
You came out on top of the coin toss. Maybe go hit up a casino, cos the odds are clearly in your favour.
---
Very true.  My kit isn't very cheesy at all, plus I've been taking some of the newbies on game pass under my wing so they don't get the whole thing spoiled for them. (Best we can do right now)  Currently I've got one weapon that's armor piercing which could be done without an effect at all (technically) and one that's just a quad.  Ya really don't need the cheese except for pve in my opinion cus mobs.  It's really the opposite of the popular consensus.
---
there's also a cooldown of 180 different items until you can get the same loot again so that's why it might appear longer for you. I have no idea if it is 10 minutes or not.
---
Can anyone even use shotties?  All mine will visibly sheer off a section of HP bar, then instantly refill it doing chip damage.  I literally can only cripple limbs with them, and switch to anything after to actually get kills. 
---
The raw hatred I feel when I nail a Scorchbeast, it crashes to the ground and I start dumping buckshot into its face, watching as Enforcer leaves it a stationary loot pinata....only to watch as every shot does (1/4hp gone) (Full Hp) (1/4hp gone) (Full Hp).  I've actually gone from a full over repair to broken, just point blank headshots, and not gained any progress.  It's noticeable on anything that doesn't die in the 1st shot, escpecially the tanky mobs.  Anymore I only use my shotty to ground SB's or kneecap Ghouls.
---
Its just a Quad/Limb Damage/50Dr while reloading Combat shottie.  It was somebodies Watoga vendor trash 2yrs ago I bought for like 1200caps.  But this happens with any shotgun I've used. Even barebones Double Barrels I make.
---
It’s actually not a timer. It’s manually entered in. I find this hilarious because it’s literally someone’s job to update that number when they could’ve just had a live counter. 
---
I mean the technology is there and has been there for years how have they not figured out how to do a live counter.
---
Cork isn't that bad. That mothman place all the way north of the map in the forest. It has loads of junk that contains cork.
---
gib
---
Scrapbox, perhaps? That should be free to everyone regardless of what they pay.
---
While playing, every time I open the map I always make sure to cast a quick eye at the observatory area. And I rarely see any other players there, most of the time the place is abandoned.
---
Shit is with you forever sadly. I love when trash quest items are forever welded to your character. Doesn't half smack of a shit design for an even shitter quest. Like my three Grafton Dam keys. 
---
Congrats. You found a vault door. I'll insert this irremovable holo into your anus.
---
Oh for fucks sake. Its not bethesdas fault your base was build in a spot that gets nuked.
---
WoW did it live with the AQ gates 20 years ago...
---
Yes it does hurt something.... Your chances to loot weapons.with an actually usefull major legendary effect.
---
And if you want something doing damages in an RPG, it seems important that it scales or its useless.
---
Unfortunately the closest we may ever get is flying the Avenger in GTA.
---
either way, thank you man ...much appreciated
---
Should it not disappear if you take everything from the ash pile
---
Exactly the same thing that's happening to my ammo converter, it just don't work, and I was just starting getting comfortable with the old setting. PS4.
---
By that logic we don’t need gun run displays either, we can just stick to holding our weapons because that’s “pretty much do the same thing”.
---
No no it’s still here , I’m streaming if you want to come and try and help they way ? So you can see
---
You can farm concrete easily as base
---
My bf told me I should use this to make friends in the game so I thought I would give it a shot 🥴
---
I also wanna see this!
---
https://www.twitch.tv/angrygrapestoner
---
Jokes aside, thats allmost the real state shotgun are in the game right now....
---
It seems to be mostly tied to low health builds. If you are full health you probably won't run into it.
---
Build it in a no nuke zone
---
My mistake on Ultracite power armour. Also sorry if I'm hard to understand due to my writing, dyslexic xD
---
Basically so today, we fight outside of the nuke so for the reasons you stated. But the game clearly didn't intend for it. The game will respawn you in and around the intended fight area and as a community we have decided to dismiss that. I'm not trying its better in the nuke zone but it was the intended way. Other than her health pool, the fight is very easy, managing you're rads is meant to be part of the fight.
---
Ignoring how the game gearing you for the fight. The SBQ quite often flys back and around the fissure site, there is a small outpost where this isn't noticeable but that bunker is more popular. You most likely have seen the queen just fly into the nuke zone around the fissure site, requiring someone to drag her back.
---
If you look at the first 6/7mouths when the game came out. Nobody had this issue, we all killed her in the nuke zone next to her fissure site. The problem with spawning in the nuke zone started after people got used to not taking rad protection.
---
you can just walk to the Charleston Fire Department and it will start "Into the Fire" without any issue (which is a bigger issue imo) especially when some dialogue implies you are vaccinated and my quest is still in progress
---
Oh that would rock! I’ll probably have to ditch back to my base and collect some ammo but my gamer tag is CanadianSk8er
---
Try using Third Person at different distances and wiggle the camera around. You MIGHT manage to snag your loot's hitbox.
---
Nope! No enough room for a Enclave vertibird or a BOS Liberty Prime!
---
0/10
---
Sorry.
---
The physical C.A.M.P item you placed down initially. You can walk up to it and it will have an option to repair .
---
If anyone has played PvZGW then they know what this is going to lead to...
---
Cloth and glass we'll hit easy. We'll probably get leather too. Definitely not getting concrete or cork. I really don't think we'll get plastic either but we might?
---
I got it only for preventing my armor from appearing in the scrapping UI but I must say it grew on me, much better than the score skin. And no bugs that I could see
---
I didn't ask what do I go back in time and do before this happened, I asked what do I do now. Thanks for adding nothing to the conversation.
---
THANK YOU
---
I always run into this guy and his team.
---
Always manages to launch at least one nuke and get a ton of kills, even when not using the best gear. I've been killed by him even when I've had the drop on him with better equipment, and I'm a decent player myself (5+ kills each match, get a nuke every 5 games or so)
---
If it were on PC I'd be more suspicious, but since it's Xbox I guess he just has an amazing perk setup
---
It's a Modern Warfare quote(s) my man
---
Is there rad storms in NW?
---
It's a bit dickish to remove the credits, but in your own copy if you delete the top 4 rows you can then use the the filter option to only list the ones you haven't ticked. Currently there's a vertical merge in Column R onwards that stops it if you leave the top part unchanged (so instead of deleting you can just remove this merge and then filter but that's a bit more fiddly). Might be something you want to think about incorporating as default? Amazing work!
---
yeah when someone drops a nuke, i mean a rad storm in the nuke zone
---
"A little less lately"  have you been running around with more health? It seems to be tied to low heath (or potentially high rads). I'm trying to find the line. I moved a character to low health build and instantly started having problems. Full health never had issues. Moved another to low health and instantly had issues. So it is either low health, high rads, or serendipity card.
---
Yeah imo B/50/25 is the god roll for a combat shotgun because you get :
---
Bloodied for damages,
---
Limb damages as a magic effect and possibly crippling the queen which should be fixed soon,
---
Less VATS action cost which is pefect because you have to use VATS for the bug to trigger on a shotgun.
---
Wind your neck in. What you have asked is a dumb question. " My base has been nuked, what can I do?" 
---
Umm let me think about that.......
---
Rebuild it or move elsewhere. What answer was you hoping for? That it would magically reappear? 
---
Your question adds nothing of value. Just complete and utter nonsense.
---
Ok.
---
So it refers to the out of bounds storm (i hope) the one that usually kills the afk players.
---
Oh and blaming bethesda..... grow up
---
This event *is* heavily relying on FO1st members. The problem is: many FO1st members cancelled their subscriptions just as the update went live due to many decisions Bethesda has made. 
---
This was not a good time to fix the camp bug people were using to create stylish builds.
---
But also they don’t offer good enough rewards. Why would someone donate 250 concrete for alcohol when they can get more foundations and alcohol from their collectron?
---
If I’m going to give something away, I’ll put it in a suitcase at a train station (usually Whitesprings).  If I’m going to use stash space then it needs to be for something I’ll get a return on.  I don’t see the point of selling something for 1 cap (ammo and other bulk goods excepted).  Just dump it in a suitcase and someone else will pick it up if they want it.  Why waste the stash space?
---
That's a blast zone, not a radstorm. Radstorms aren't in NW. You see them in adventure mode where everything turns green and you get a small amount of rads for being outside.
---
The challenge refers to the firestorm
---
ohh, okay, thank you, i wonder how will people achieve this,ton of stimpaks mayber
---
Had 25% speed one before two shot and had same glich, where most shots are miss, like server isnt able to register that fast.
---
thank you for clarifying
---
That's awesome! I bet it looks great at night.
---
I also hate the fact that if I wanted that perk, I would literally have to change my characters entire special distribution to get it. It's really overpowered compared to any of the other perks.  
---
Oh, and the fact that other serums are available as loot but frog legs for some reason is a perk? Its really dumb.
---
I did round up but do you really think junk that isn't commonly used outside of camp building is that rare? I mean for some yes. I do not have much concrete. But that doesn't make it rare because of concrete bags. You get concrete in mass as some workstations, you get is as a reward from some events. Plus a lot of people have played the game longer than a year.
---
Plus do you honestly believe that the required amount of junk is meant to be farmed in 4 days? No one is doing that. How'd you think the steel part of half done is a day? Because people already had ton and tons of steel. This event is more is junk clean out than anything.
---
SO thank you all for needed explanation, going to level up a bit and got for rifleman and use commando for big baddies if single shot rifles wont do the trick.
---
Being able to do it was a bug. They fixed it with patch 21
---
PSA: turns out I was right, he reset yesterday as usual and then today again on new timer. I got 600 gold in 24 hours
---
Thats unfortunately the state non magic shotgun are in right now in the game.
---
Would the healing factor mutation somewhat help in its place?
---
The BoS are simply too hard to kill. And if anyone kills off the BoS, it’s the Courier in NV, or the Sole Survivor in 4.
---
Well I’ve given tons of Instigatings to the legendary vending machine and gotten at least 15 scrip from axes in total.
---
Probably not since it only heals you outside of combat
---
I call him the end boss
---
As a non 1st member. Where do you think we can pull 250 concrete from? I have never had more than 100 stashed. And how would you even farm it? Server hop through spawn points in hopes of finding ones others have missed? And for what? Alcohol and hat rack with logo? No thanks. I don't hate my freetime that much lol
---
Does anyone know where the great Gnome versus Flamingo battle took place?
---
I ran across it once but wanted to show my buddy and couldn't recall where it was.
---
Seriously I've never seen tards struggle with an event so much as I have with Encryptid.
---
I don’t want community managers being the ones playing the stream. I want someone who actually works on the game and gets paid for it to sit down and play this game. I also want Todd Howard himself to come on the stream. Ok and maybe a community manager so the stream isn’t *just* chat trashing everyone up there.
---
All I want to know is why the heck they need more concrete than steel 🤷‍♂️
---
So how is everyone doing this ?  I put on rad resist and went in, I lived about 35 seconds.  I'm on my alt because my main is 1 match from leveling and clearly I'll wait for level day to play my main.  The next 4 times we got completely spawn fucked for choosing the edge of the map and 9 red dots were near me. I got punched to death as I loaded in.  🙄 Should I jump in the storm with stim packs and rad x, rad away.
---
Come now, give Arthur credit where it’s due! He’s smoking hot...
---
That was the first legendary gun I received, the anti-scorched 10m training pistol.
---
Common plans. Get em for 5 caps a piece. I absolutely hate how they take up actual weight and how I get rewarded with so many of them.
---
I've never seen the axe *at all*, let alone legendary, in over 400 hours.
---
Well, I did 500. Not as much as I did for Steel, but, way harder to get in a short time.
---
If that's the case, then that's great!  But if anything, I feel like it wouldn't be bad if they did it a bit more.
---
They could also work more on debugging and fixing their engine.  If they don't ditch it for a new one, they could at least clean house on their existing one.
---
I love how people still think these updates add on 10gb when it’s all apart of the bug fixes and what not, and it literally replaces that data, not adds on.
---
You can farm concrete at abandoned bog town
---
No, I think they'll claim the page was glitched all day and we did make the target goal, and pretend like we did make it.
---
Man imagine if you don’t donate materials they actually modify the estate and make it all mad max ish
---
Look at what u have. Ore u can’t smelt. Stims weigh a lot and u don’t need 200 of them. Ammo keep what u use and .45 5.56 you’ll want later. Take bandolier perk and carry them. Missiles and mini nukes won’t sell and u won’t use them. Don’t horde 500 bones u won’t use them. Scrip crap legendarys Daily. If u get more than u can scrip sell them in your vendor at 15 caps a point. They will sell fast. Turn lead into 5.56 and .45 onky keep 100 in your stash.
---
I put on all my dmg and rad resist perk cards, managed to find a stimpak, and kept sprinting through the fire (cause of the dmg resist when sprinting card-no idea if it actually worked). But anyway, running in and out of the fire to regen my AP worked, so it doesn’t need to be a continuous 1 min at least.
---
No problem. There is a quest based around it called The Bucket List
---
I hate the encrypted quest, never succeede, tried many times, every time some dicks come in there and wait for me to do all the work, but the fucking robot barely takes damage
---
I am new to the Game. Can somebody explain, how I do start the challenge?
---
What I wrote doesn't include every reason people hate the event or don't do it. A lot of people feel like you do to. But I've seen more people  complain about losing their junk for shared rewards than the donor boxes. A lot if people actually like the hat and flag and want it. BoS looking stuff I've noticed sell really well in the atomic shop. Just adding these two thing there and I bet people would want it more.
---
Also remember not every player experienced the joy of hunting a unique scorched/mole miner to find the odd are not in your favour. Plus this is the first community event where we got something like the ATLAS donor boxes. People should ask for more form them. But all in all, I found the bigger issue if no one wants stuff everyone has.
---
He is the pet you want for your camp
---
No, you cannot. It needs time to respawn, since its a static junk and not a lootable enemy.
---
With the new blue vault bags your ability to hit exactly the right spot is soooooo much lower.  
---
Honestly they need to fix the overlap issues.  If someone is using a plasma gun or caster you will never be able to loot anything.  At Line in the Sand all the nurses kept spawning in front of the Sonic gen, a glitch we've encountered about a dozen times.  Anyway this time we had a huge group, lots of help, and someone used a plasma caster.  NBD, right?!  Well you end up with empty goo piles on top of meat piles and ash piles spawn in between.  I'm talking 150 piles of meat, goo, and ash.  
---
Also anyone else notice things like the Queen and other big enemies aren't dropping anything, or just 1 item?  I dealt so much damage to the SBQ and when I sent to loot she had nothing but 10 railway spikes.  My husband had her drop in a different spot (weird glitch we encounter constantly) but under her wings were all the extra items, just on the ground.  🤦🏻‍♀️ In Uranium Fever I'm having this and just getting tin cans off of them.
---
It’s an impossible/extremely hard goal to reach to keep people playing as much as possible for a small reward
---
Got it
---
The machine literally farms it for you... you just have to unload it. Ez
---
TY!  I didn't realize I could run out.  🤦🏻‍♀️ 💜 I'm playing too late for my brain to work.
---
I love the idea of vertibird “fast travel”. It should be free, but you would actually have travel time and could be shot down by super mutants and/or players.
---
I have a vampire's grognaks axe and it's my favorite 🥴
---
It's not really that dire. It's a mess, but still doable.
---
The pet physically walks from where it was all the way to your base, so if it's far, yeah, it'll take a while. If there are players along the route then it will can run into enemies and die. To avoid that you can try to keep up with it, which doesn't really work, or server hop every so often because its health will replenish. On a private server you could probably go straight back to camp and it'll eventually arrive, but I'm never that willing to wait and see.
---
I've never had a pet not show up doing this. It just always takes a while.
---
Keeping them alive is harder but if you really want to, just live in the forest. Keep your camp device away from foundations so it won't spawn in one and die, plenty of room to get around, and point a few turrets at that spot. Had the same sloth for the last six months or so.
---
But you miss out on all the enemies from the other locations. And there’s a big flat area by delta. Idk if I’m going through the effort of nuking I want to get the most out of it HRF, glowing mass, etc wise
---
Yes I agree with you, cross-playing isn't viable atm. But cross saving wouldn't have these problems.
---
Dunno?
---
I know you don’t want to buy them but I just want to point out most armor plans are deemed as lower tier rewards which is why a lot of players just sell them for cheap in vendors.
---
But they can spawn in many places. I know marine armor spawns in Harper’s Ferry. Not the greatest armor but cool looking at least
---
Yo did see that they prob add double sided walls to atom shop and nick another load of cash for it 🙈
---
Depends on the group, we've had really good luck with groups who show up for every event, tag and call you.  Then we've had awful luck where people intentionally 1 shot everything.  If I find people who are awesome in a group I'll inbox them to friend for playing events later.
---
Probably gonna be something like a new camp plant like fireberries or whatever those ones that explode are called even tho they should have been added a long time ago
---
You're very much mistaken about this subreddit. Take a look at the hot posts at any given time, the vast majority of them are complaints in some form.
---
Difference being, most people have enough brain cells to present their complaints in a reasoned way, allowing for discussion. There are plenty of people with negative opinions about the game, but your post is quite literally 'I hate the game, if you disagree with me you're a virgin'. When asked how the game could be improved, you suggest 'make it not suck by not using software from 2010'. Just lol. How insightful and constructive (and also factually incorrect). I very much doubt you'd been even born in 2010 in all honesty, based on your posts.
---
I'm sure plenty of tears will be shed if you stop playing permanently and never return. The game isn't perfect, and that's the general consensus, but it's certainly improved when there are less morons around, so don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
Pretty sure todd is the only one making this game
---
Omg, yes.... All the people who dropped dozens of Legendaries at the WSs.  It's how I have all my best weapons.
---
I've had that happen with a couple locations, a server hop should fix it.
---
I use this mutation with a bloodied build and it serves quite well. Only times I actually need to heal with stimpaks or whatever is if I’m doing scorched earth. Not a problem any other time
---
Dragons are legacy?
---
Once you reach level 50, progression via leveling comes to a stop. Your hp is determined by your SPECIAL. By level 50 you have access to the best of the armor in game, and everything. 
---
What you need to focus is on build. If you spec into the right build, you can easily mow down anyone. Just make sure they haven’t gotten the right build
---
Oh my goodness, I call her mama murmur! I had no idea anyone had a similar name haha.
---
Oh man.  I pissed my husband off so bad by shooting a settler engineer while he was getting a quest.  I've always just shot first and 100% shot Graham the first time I saw him.  😂 Thankfully most of the time he's patient and we both laugh it off.
---
I have more than 1700. The should  increase the limit or introduce something like a bigger weekly limit
---
Wow that's interesting.
---
Although, it's not like you can do it too many times with the 30,000 cap.
---
Do you have photos?
---
You know that since you explained that, it falls under rule 8: Encouraging Exploits
---
What worked for me: 
---
Restarting from main menu a few times and then going to the terminal, reading all entries EXCEPT analyze blood. Then putting t fuse in, then analyzing blood. It seemed to only work on a few servers, has to server swap many times but it worked for my friend and I ... maybe about 5x server hopping
---
yep\~ but some players have tons of Hoildays Gifts..
---
Yeah. Have been since wastelanders, and pretty much before that. Since the purveyor was introduced you could only get them from the chest at the end of the vault raid dead in the water. Once that was removed they became legacy. Same thing happened to rippers
---
You can still get 1* dragons and rippers from the monster mash event terminal. But since nobody does that, and they are just 1*, they're widely accepted as legacy
---
What I mean is, compare it to steel where you can just jump in a server, kill 20 supermutants, take their weapons and scrap them with the scrapper perk, you get 200~ steel in 5 mins, while the concrete extractor isn't only limited in location, but it needs a lot of time to fill up, and only available while you have said thing contested. The difference is huge.
---
Oh that's a big problem then.
---
Unyielding everything, even one star can sell for decent caps. But like most said the ap refresh is great and also there’s a magic effect with the 15% damage reduction while blocking secondary effect.
---
Mmorpgs are hard, anything they implement could turn out disastrous, doesn't mean they shouldn't do their best to improve in every way and make their game accessible to everyone.
---
Technically breaks the TOS of the game too 🤷‍♂️
---
I wouldnt dare to try. Too risky
---
try to talk to him again
---
I never thought I'd ever say it, but I don't need this much booze. 
---
Between that being the looks share of the provisions and the whole Nukashine and Biv quests I'm starting to think the devs need a 12 step program.
---
What weapon is that you're holding?
---
That's good to know
---
I just send you a friend request i am edwinpresto
---
It does imo, stabilized can’t compete with legendary effects (which PA can’t have) and there really aren’t any mods for PA that helps heavys, maybe protocols ? But only if ur bloodied...
---
Lol, three paragraphs is an essay now? Are you sure you graduated?
---
If you are really as old as you say you are, and you act this way, that's beyond sad.
---
[The whole Forest region is pockmarked with gravel pits](https://map76.com/res_dep/hardpointconcrete01gravelpitflor0018f506) where a concrete extractor can be placed to gather infinite concrete.
---
So to say that it cannot be farmed is patently false.
---
Get 3 stim packs and 1 radaway. Enter the storm and manage your hp wisely. You will survive. Also make sure you have the chem finder perk that lets you get aid items from containers. That helps
---
PC player count is healthy too
---
It’s a known issue with two shot, there’s a separate issue with vats but two shot is noticeably worse with the missing shots.
---
Yeah the ugly rubber ones, not the armor helmet
---
Yeah, I tested it today and I'm able to select wires fine now. I think it was just the shower itself malfunctioning.
---
Do you need a replacement to get you back on your feet?
---
I do need to though
---
The helipad is on the roof
---
It's nothing compared to killing supermutants and scrapping their assault rifles for 20 steel each in like 5 mins. Extractors are way too slow and require too much effort to conquer every time you log in a server.
---
It’s best to solo this one. Pack Nuka Cola Quantums, and a half decent build with a even a 1* Bloodied melee weapon and you can solo it. Angry Turtle soloed it in power armor (I don’t even think it was the best PA at the time either), and a Bloodied war drum at full health, using Scorchbeast meat and carnivore to do his health.
---
I can select them i just can't place them on something else sadly
---
Rollins Labor Camp is the place where Blood Eagles hold Beckett. Quest name is Narrow Escape. You can find the exact place by googling. You may want to server jump. It takes couple of seconds to load all the current objectives after you log in to a server.
---
You can use healing factor in bloodied build. But its only purpose is for you too use less stimpaks. If you use chems then i wouldnt recommend it, since it reduces their effectiveness.
---
No really it was my main secondary, was good to switch off to, but I think I'll be able to recover after a bit. I have a pretty good handmade that is my main, if that got taken I'd just quit. But thanks for the offer dude.
---
.
---
No problem
---
I agree I want one of these and Ra- ra and Gail to come and live at my camp, I also want my own Chally, and one side of her backpack would access my stash and the other side would access a FO1st scrap box, and a cooler refrigerator. Make it so Bethesda
---
You ok? You look a little... glowing
---
Radiation Rumble and Project Paradise are pretty bad too when idiots are there. I've never actually completed Project Paradise with all three animals alive
---
Go write a poem for Skeeter that's probably all you're good at you have no friends you sit in the corner drinking Mountain Dew and eating Skittles I am ashamed that I even picked up a Fallout game you sir have actually made me start to question whether I even want to play video games because I can just picture what you look like in real life you holding a blm sign wearing a Bernie shirt probably have pink hair, no eyebrows, had your dick cut off because you want to be a woman but..... you identity as a man.
---
The vault raids I felt like should’ve been structured like the final quest of the wastelanders dlc. Something big and dramatic. 
---
I wonder if when they open the vaults back up will they include npcs and make it really feel like a major thing?
---
People so salty about underground camps. Mass downvotes, why?
---
I really don't like encrypted. I'm level 200 and I was one of the lowest levels. I had to take all 3 pylons. Only one who actually killed him, then I died and couldn't respawn as the quest finished so I didn't get anything.
---
This game avoids having a large contingent of griefers simply because it isn't really possible for them. They still find ways, but being able to freely gank you at their whim, thankfully, isn't one of them.
---
Ultracite starts at 50
---
Don't forget damaged mainframe cores, before they wouldn't weight nothing. Yesterday I found out they weigh, and I was hoarding 44 of them and my weight drop drastically.
---
Groovy
---
Just disable trap damage to pacifist players period, so we don't have to worry about this stuff in our coop game.
---
No worries man
---
Theoretically you should be able to, both steam and game pass versions require a Bethesda account. So if you manage to link ur Bethesda acc on a steam copy, you would access the character, though any atoms or 1st membership are not transferable. As to how to link the accounts I have no idea, don’t know how it works on game pass and my steam copy was given around the time wastelanders launches already linked to my beth account
---
Weeks and weeks of collecting golf balls. Always had a ton of cork.
---
In reality its Bethesda fault they should make it so it cant be started by anyone else and partaking and holding the pylons gets you the drop off the sheepsquatch too
---
I delete the methods from the post, hope the dev put attentions on it.
---
DO NOT UES THIS GLITCH OF COURSE
---
Ok so I have an airship camp. Inside the airship I have a room dedicated to power. This is where all of the power conduits come from. Now this room really feels insignificant with only one. So I added another one and now it actually feels like a generator room.
---
Side effect for some reason 2 fusion generators seem to cause it to be louder.
---
A workaround that works for me (PC) is to click on your target, cancel out of the 'fast travel'? menu, then click again and actually do the fast travel.
---
Very nice build :)
---
It’s fallout 76, what do you expect
---
You sure do like talking about dicks. Definitely some issues there, especially with how quickly you turn everything to gender/sexuality. Got something to hide?
---
Also, at what point did I say I'm male or have ever been male?
---
Do you even know who Skeeter is?
---
You're embarrassing yourself. We get it, you have issues, and are also a moron. What a pitiful existence you must occupy to claim to be over 30 years old and act this way/have all this pent up sexual frustration. Get help.
---
Me either because everyone rushes as soon as the alpha shows up and all the friendly animals die :|
---
These are some of the best events too, I don’t know why no one shows up and when they do they don’t follow the prompts on screen.
---
You don't need to start anything. Head towards [ATLAS observatory](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ATLAS_Observatory) and there you will find a NPC with a BoS uniform. You can talk to him, but isn't necessary. Around him you'll find some stashes, that's where you deposit the junk.
---
this is beautiful. much respect, its amazing what people can build in this game. also, i love how the light looks in fo76, as you see in picture 1 and 4.   
---
and again i feel bad about my shabby home :D  
---
    
---
but to me, there one thing that doesnt fit: the blue/yellow vault tech flag - it doesnt match the atmosphere in my opinion. i dontspwnd much time building so i sont even know which flags are available ingame, perhaps a enclave flag would match better. or a torn down us flag? but its your home and it looks amazing, thanks for sharing!
---
The same happened to me :c
---
Thank you, fellow vault dweller.
---
Exactly. They are feeding off the search results which tend to favor hating on fallout. That's all YouTube was for a year about 76. I read the same article and it's absolute trash.
---
Sadly though those talking about these games (which includes outer world's) do no justice to the game itself. We should, as gamers, celebrate these games for their own merits and not to be a "fallout killer." I want all of these games to succeed and be their best. If they are the company wins consumers win and we have more games in the future. Anyone who laughs at the failures of a game or uses a games failure to boost another probably does similar stuff in other parts of life and carry some pain.
---
Well at least they did a good job of trolling everyone with that Welcome Mat that was in the atom store 😂
---
At least you can make it to the alpha with more than one animal alive. Whenever I play the event, everyone just protects the habitat with the radstags, and often don't even deposit any venison. It's almost always two level 0 creatures in the other habitats, and a lot of times even just a level 1 in the first habitat, because I'm the only person doing the objective.
---
Look at us get downvoted for stating facts.
---
The daughter of a plantation owner again you're a BLM protester / rioters. no pent-up anger here  if you actually are a girl I'm sure you're not the prettiest thing to look at you got to be a disgusting unbathed crusty fingernailed  'hardcore Goth girl  gamer"   You are nothing but a mud duck
---
Thanks ill give that a try.
---
Or they have the internet. Who knows?
---
sheepsquatch club.
---
Unfortunately only have the vault tec or future tec flag at the moment and I was trying to use it to draw attention to the storefront, though it hasn't been working haha. thanks for your kind words :)
---
Someone by themselves donated 100 million steel?
---
I donated 10,000 and had to suffer the animation for the gift forty times. 
---
They would get that animation FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES. They would never be able to play again.
---
Being a 1st sub I can tell ya we usually have round  1500 -2000 concrete or cork, it is not something we really farmed or sought basically got there as byproduct of other junk scrapping.... That said as people have mentioned rewards are just not worth emptying ur limited amount, and the bar is super high for these mats.... I think even if we did we would not make it, only duppers can save us
---
Massively subjective. I would personally say bloodied ultracite gatling laser, but that's because I'm too lazy to farm ammo and 1k shots per fusion core w/power user is niiice. 
---
If you wanna be Cheesy, bloodied minigun with 33% vats hit chance/ bash dmg - put an accelerated barrel on it and you have a magic bloodied weapon that will melt literally everything.
---
I’ve seen that many times too :)
---
Not really. Isnt the concrete goal reward a flag pole?
---
Really wish we could build our camps here. Maybe when they bring around that "pro mode" they were talking about we can build at some existing locations etc.
---
Lol were not even at cork yet that's the worst 😫
---
What kind of storm are you supposed to be in for a minute? I’ve never seen a rad storm in NW
---
I'd use the stealth armor for rad rumble if i wasn't over encumbered with it. Only use i have for it.
---
Ada was better.
---
And Curie ;-)
---
Sounds good to me, the minigun seems like it eats about 4000 rounds for a snack though

You go to the [ATLAS Observatory](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ATLAS_Observatory) and you donate the requested junk items 250 pieces at a time. Each time you donate an it you get a loot crate that gives you 5 random items from this list:

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
Be aware that total isn't a live feed and it's manually updated by Bethesda once a day.
---
Fast travelling to someones CAMP or pre existing map marker? 
---
If this happens when travelling to camp, it depends on the placement of the camp module which everyone can put wherever they want and the players will spawn in awkward places.
---
I would literally empty my scrapbox to see this. On all 5 of my characters
---
It does, but put it this way, that 4k would probably drop the sbq. If you're not familiar with magic effects on heavy weapons, it basically glitches the game into thinking you have done more dmg than you have.
---
Oh, and it amplifies whatever effect you have. So a bloodied minigun or a bloodied lmg would probably be the most powerful eapons in the game if you trigger magic effects
---
I am. I'm a sucker for free stuff. When I looked at my steal scrap I had 40k. I looked at my concrete scrap and had 3k...
---
In a compulsive hoarder. If I had 3k others aren't doing as well. 
---
If we don't achieve this concrete one it'll suck the wind from me doing the rest.
---
Pretty sure Bethesda will have to rethink as most of the upcoming ones won't ever be reached. I believe there would be enough scrap out there, just not a lot of interest at the moment. I've played over 3000 hours &amp; due to boredom I haven't logged in since Thursday last week when I finished the legendary run.
---
Yea, true.
---
But I cannot be bothered to farm flux, Id rather just fight the queen and get the rewards and the bog doesn’t have any of that sweet sweet cobalt flux anyways.
---
I don't see how it can tbh. I'm on the upper end of OCD junk collectors, and I play around 2 hours a day. Played for 5 months after launch &amp; continued after Wastelanders.. I have around 1.5k cork in my scrap box. There's just not enough of it.
---
Given that concrete is one of the scarcer resources it seems like an unachievable target, even with resource collectors going full tilt. You’d think they would know that.
---
That gattling gauss if you got the plan. Though ammo farming is even worse.
---
Junk and meds, #1 weight hogs. 
---
Don't hold onto weapons you'll never use just because they are cool. Displaying items counts as stash weight so 'weigh' those choices carefully. That Fatman sitting in your living room might look cool but is it really worth having 20lbs less space? Does it bring you joy? ;p
---
Same goes for armor, unless you are waiting to hit level so you can equip it, or waiting until you can mod something, don't hold onto armor you won't use. Scrap it for materials or sell at a vendor. 
---
Meds you'll want to limit to just what you use (see a pattern emerging?) If you don't use chems, don't horde them. Sell at vendors. 
---
Don't try to horde Nuka as they get heavy. Carry a few on you but don't stash that many. 
---
I prefer using fresh food from my own tiny farm, so I sell or insta use any packaged food I find. If you've got a stash full of canned dog food you might have better luck just selling them all and planting some corn beside a water pump and cooking station. 
---
Don't horde purified water, it is plentiful and you can get rich by selling them in bulk. 
---
Speaking of bulk...
---
Junk will be your most micro managed asset. You'll know better what to keep and what you don't want as you progress but for now the 2 most important items to always grab will be adhesive and screws. Never pass them up. You can go into pip boy and select Junk, then use component view to highlight scrap you want. That puts a small magnifying glass icon next to anything containing it, so you don't miss picking it up.
---
Adhesive
---
Screws
---
Steel
---
Wood
---
Acid
---
Leather
---
Springs
---
Will be used the most from level 1-50. Horde these items. 
---
Things like;
---
Glass
---
Coal
---
Gold
---
Silver
---
Asbestos
---
Are all used rarely and only needed for specific items. As such you don't need to keep very much on hand, if at all. I typically collect it until I have enough to bulk and then sell the excess. 
---
Don't keep ore you have no use for. Ore is kept in the Misc. tab for some reason along with Gunpowder. If you have any, you can smelt it (with acid) at a chemistry station. 
---
You can bulk Junk using plastic at the Tinkers workbench. This can be a great way to free up space in your stash while also giving you extra caps. 
---
Mods are heavy! If you have mods in your stash get rid of them unless.... you know the drill by now. ;p
---
Same goes for Ammo. Limit to only the type you will be using. Having those mini nukes and 40mm grenades might make you sleep better at night, knowing they are there for a 'rainy day' but in reality... you'll never end up needing them.
---
We could just scrap a load of weapons with the scrapper perk. Not sure where we are getting concrete from. Im not impressed with the atlas crates anyway.
---
Thank you. That is very helpful.
---
How do you trigger a magic effect? Or is it just a luck thing? Also, I've seen people use explosive Bloodied miniguns before and it broke my games sound.
---
A little, I always liked the Brotherhood.
---
You server hopped. New server is not scheduled to sutdown. End of mistery.
---
The stealth suit is my go to choice when I'm running around Appalachia as a stealth shotgunner. 1 shotting 3 star legendaries, then disappearing like a fart in the wind.
---
Lv 52 in 7 days??? You ok homie?
---
Made me giggle because Todd doesn't even make his own bed in the morning.
---
I wouldn't hold your breath on getting a good gun with 1k scrip haha. Murgh is not that kind
---
The 50cal, Ult gat laser, lmg, gattling gun, gauss mini, are all solid guns. You want ffr as a second. And either bloodied or junkies for your first depending on your build
---
But there is no "best" heavy weapon
---
Silent, but deadly
---
I carry a 10mm just for this. Legendaries, Bloated Ghouls, etc. Cripple a leg. Slow it down. Everyone gets a chance to tag it. Left on the d-pad... that simple.
---
I was very disappointed when I found out you couldn't build in the farm
---
Moving the silly camp box thing around ur camp will move the spawn point for ur camp, I kept getting stuck in my own foundations and having to fast travel away. I think some people get a kick out of u spawning in and falling 50ft. Some of bethesda's spawn locations are pretty questionable too.
---
[From Dusk till Dawn.](https://imgur.com/a/VCx7Wsa)
---
And if we don't make the milestone does it mean the brotherhood of steel fails that much faster? does it mean the pre-arranged graphics they already have done for each stage of the atlas has to be changed cuz there's not enough concrete to build up the atlas anymore? And who needs a hundred and seventy-five million units of cork?
---
At this point idk anymore I barely goy any materials and I hve fallout 1st and been playing sine beta
---
The mari e tactical helmet is a plan you can find around the cranberry bog. It goes with the marine wetsuit.
---
Make sense but why will they shut down just that server?
---
I should note that the whole community expects this goal of Concrete and the next goal of Cork to fail because those junk items are not easily farmable and don't have a lot of in game use so the average player doesn't even have more than 500 of both of these junk items laying around.
---
The mire is my favourite place to build, although I am camped by Whitesprings just to make things easier. It’s a shame really that we have fast travel costs, because it means people don’t build often in the outer edges.
---
Very specific legendary effects and a fire rate of 200+, is the short answer. Prefix of junkies, instigating or stalkers. 2nd star of 50%limb dmg, 33% vats hit chance or bashing dmg. If you have any one of those 6 + fire rate 200+ it will trigger the magic effect IF you hit the same body location consecutively
---
If you have a look at angry turtle on YouTube, he's done a series of videos on the subject.
---
After Vault 79, you can get reputation with both factions.
---
even after the main wastelander quest is done you can still do dailies for each faction and earn reputation so that you can buy everything..no worries
---
I know I'm a bit late but I didn't know until I built a very complicated camp and then looked at the map, is it only for the player whose camp it is or everyone? As in, is my camp invisible for team mates, so on?
---
Melee is harder in the early part of the game. At end game bloodied melee out performs every gun in the game in terms of damage many times over. Leveling up just stay in and around the forest. Join a building team for the extra intel which boosts your exp gain. Join events that have a high level player or two and tag the mobs, stay out of the way and let the high levels kill them all. Collect every gun. Scrap every gun. You’ll learn the mods for them. And just play at your pace leveling to 50 is the hardest part to do.
---
Oh, my bad. Thought we were talking about the assault one.
---
Clickbot probably. I didn't counted if it were 100kk, it was a 30min video of a super high speed fast forwarded video. Also, he most likely dumped the supply crates at once after penetrating the donation chest.
---
Due the bug on main quest, I suggest doing the mistress of mistery,frat party, tadpole and taxidermy quest lines (this one is one of my personal favorites). Also do as many events as u can still eco ally the ones marked with (!)
---
As for weapons melee is actually viable, specially unarmed or 2h, you still want to have a gun for some scenarios but melee is a good choice. Also don’t worry about gear until you get to 50 from there on you start putting your build together using legendary weapons and armor (unless u use PA).
---
If ur PC I can gladly help u out with starter gear and questing in general.
---
Although it's not a full on dealer of death, the sheer fun of standing in a battle totally immune to any incoming (apart from reloading) don't dismiss the fun factor of a vampire heavy gun
---
I remember this problem as well. I *think* there was another spot in the pawn shop by the board to drop it. Not sure though.
---
I wonder if it's the Gauss weapon (still VATS-challenged, BTW) or the Bloodied prefix? I was using my Instigating gauss rifle Sunday AM and seemed to be doing as much damage as shown...given, the RoF is too slow for hordes or fast-moving groups, but the damage seemed fine. That said, I wasn't in a Queen fight; I did kill a rando SB near Tanagra town, but it took a while.
---
Every item except my stimpacks recipe is 5 caps. Mags, bobble heads, guns, and armor.
---
Probably ask for a refund on the websites support.
---
I got a white responder helmet from Fly Swatter. I had to do that boring event 50 times first but hey, white responder helmet.
---
Yeah, that makes sense. He figured some fo76 players might have encountered this before and asked to post this as a favor.
---
Ok good because I only just got done recommending the game to friends and don't want to have to turn around and tell them it is better to buy a toaster made from the spleen of a wambat. Wait then what is the point telling you you can't help them anymore? Is it for the who you going in with? Why not say that?
---
Battle bots. It’s bugged half the time. Just swipe, go to the other one and swipe, then to the front doors. If they won’t open it’s bugged, nothing you can do about it.
---
That is regrettable. The community cannot reach the goal?
---
Exactly, im guessing they aren’t too bad a problem on PC but the fallout gameplay style has never really felt PVP based on controller at all
---
Legendary dragons
---
Can confirm. I have an vampires accelerated minigun with ffr. Vamp effect with 255 fire rate is basically. Immortality
---
This was just a hopeless way of trying to remove d00ped materials from the game. It was the same with the mole miner event being used to rid the game of caps
---
definitely one of my peeves...post-apocalyptic teleportation technology seems to have a few bugs..
---
I got my SO to play but she wants me to level her account up before she plays anymore lol. I’ve just been taking her with me to tag scorch beats while I take them down. Game will be more fun for her when he’s level 50-60
---
Gauss shotgun is the true answer.
---
One stim extra is all I used. Spawned in at the edge. Stood in it till was 1/4 health. Ran in and found a crate or two and the third had a stim extra. Went inside the circle and waited. Storm came. Stepped back in. At 1/8 health I stepped out. Took the stim. Waited for health to max and stood in again. Don’t think it was a full minute but it gave me the award.  The. Did my usual NW routine. Sneaky sneaky sneaky dead
---
Thanks i linked both steam and Xbox on the same bethesda.net acc and i can play both my characters! Thanks for the tip.
---
I call her Mama Murmagur
---
Make sure your server setting for your private server is open to all friends and not team only. If it's team only you'll have to join the team in the main menu before joining the server.
---
As far as I'm aware mama mumbles is the widely used name for her, when I'm talking to my wife about her it's murga murg but when talking to someone on the mic it's mama mumbles
---
It asks you if you wanna leave but spawning you in if it’s a nuke zone.
---
Instructions unclear dick caught in ceiling fan.
---
ya, it's just for that final push..
---
There's no excuse at UF, Christ sake the amount of shotguns and shit on the floor
---
Turns out you can access everyting when you link both steam and xbox acc on the same bethesda account. You dont loose any progress at all. 
---
Thanks for the tip tho :).
---
I do the same thing early game. Then when you follow a Build, like Riflemen with Nerd Rage and Chinese Stealth Armor, you need a lot of stimpacks. But I split in x2 in workbench. I´m a lone wanderer, so every mission or event I need more stimpacks that someone with a group of friends :S
---
The main problem are not the Stims or the Radaways, the problem it´s always that Junk that you can´t notice. Cost me a lot of time figured out that Powder, Wood, and Steel was overweitghting me (it´s spelled right? im not English speaker xD )
---
Armor doesn’t matter mix and match em
---
I wanna leave a message on Bethesdas Twitter that says "you caint do DIS on CONK REET" with a video of me flipping directly onto my skull after spending the last 4 hours just trying to gather enough concrete for 3 donations
---
Awesome! Glad to hear that !
---
You can actually. I explanied how on other comments.
---
What platform are you?
---
Sweet!
---
Hit me up if u need any help in game. I love helping new players out
---
May be various reasons. Once a server is live for a certain time it will get more and more lagging, or they hotfixed something where your new server had the changes already applied.
---
Fallout 76 servers are hosted by amazon, each world is individual in terms of stability and status.
---
Thanks i would like that very much :D
---
I have fo1st and I'm an avid builder... I probably have 1k concrete between 3 characters because there's just no reason to farm it unless I'm getting lead from the monorail elevator. I'm not donating the little bit I have for some shitty rewards. For something cool maybe, but as the rewards stand now, absolutely not worth it.
---
I thought I was the only one that loved weasel, I really want her as my camp all
---
Donated 5k - have been hoarding it for a while :)
---
Monorail Elevator and Abandoned Bog Town are the best places to pick up concrete, Kanawha Country Cemetery has a few too .
---
Also Garden Gnomes ... each one contains 3 concrete
---
Damn, I know it was reprogrammed, but I could never find him. How do you find him? This is adorable!! I had no idea they drew on the face with what looks like Sharpie 😆 (yes, I know Sharpie doesn’t exist in fallout, but it looks like it :-)  )
---
We dont care if they are poor share man
---
I thought they were just miners who had their suits melt to them?
---
I find at least one a day. And i've slowly been putting the price up on it :p 
---
People pay 1499 for the BoS underarmor plans as well
---
Ltp.
---
Where do you donate? I only saw donation boxes for steel. I didn’t see anything for concrete or plastic etc...
---
Well both steam and Bethesda launcher run on the same servers so you could still play with each other, but if you really need a steam copy you would need to ask a refund on the third party, since you did not purchased it with Bethesda they aren’t likely to do anything about it
---
Good, now I don't have to pay a cap to fast travel to the Firebreathers HQ anymore, so glad the game has gotten this far in terms of QOL features. /s
---
Takes a few tries, but once you get it figured, it's easy. The real nuisance part is the keycards don't stack in your inventory and start to completely take over your Misc. tab.
---
Awesome then tomorrow I I blow a new hole in the vault and leave the face meat of what ever is in there. Wait they said robots. Eh I will hang something up on the walls.
---
I did to - donated 30k without even noticing. Have replaced most of it already.
---
Might as well just require to press the interaction button and deposit all your treasury notes in hand that can fit. It's not like you're going to use them somewhere else...
---
Is this the liberator that leads you into the deep? I never knew it had a smiley face on it that’s adorable
---
Hi, my settings are set to friends only. The issue is that when I'm sending people who are already my friends on Xbox live it's not registering them on Fallout Social Menu, so I cant see their Usernames in Friends only in recent.
---
How do I Join/ create a team at the main menu? Seems like I'm unable to invite anyone to a team other than when I'm in a public game.
---
you cold probably get 100 caps for one maybe. 
---
I scrapped my red hat by accident recently (thought it was my uniform and nearly died) and i was like 'oh i'll just go to the fort and find one' 20 trips in there and i couldn't find one. Found one in a vendor for 500 caps and i was like 'WOO!'
---
I have not played PvZGW....
---
is it a porno game?
---
Huh, pretty sure I've got some stashed away on my mule, don't remember the specs of them though
---
during SBQ event?
---
When they stop selling i'll put the price down =0
---
Aye. Not that i go there anymore. 
---
Lost Home is obviously handier as you can fast travel straight there
---
:) good luck! if you've done a silo run, it will remind you of that..
---
Armor has 10 lvl increments so raider for example will have 15, 25, 35, and 45.
---
Well that's 300,000 concrete right there
---
This is something i want to know as well!
---
I love this game but the players are soft asf, you can’t even PvP in the few designated PvP areas without them shitting their diapers
---
I think you can also progress further if you just kill him
---
I reread the post nvm lol...
---
That *is* closer to Mama Murphy so seems legit.
---
They've never been discounted before, so I doubt it.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Shame, thanks though.
---
I only sell fusion cores at 25/50/75/100 percent. They stack this way. Less clutter. 5/10/15/20 caps respectively. Sell out fast.
---
I won a giveaway for a b2525 fixer. Traded it for a be250 handmade and a 2star b50crit fixer. I'm then going to trade the b50 fixer for a be lmg
---
how
---
:)
---
Different tools for different jobs. Bloodied for the queen, vampires for encryptid......
---
Devs fell asleep on The keyboards while setting up value for quest....
---
Yes it does.
---
Concrete bags sometimes and workshops i guess?
---
I have to apologise to everyone; as this whole quest line of scavenging junk just doesn't interest me much I haven't contributed. 
---
*I* could be the reason why it's failing..sigh..
---
Even without trap damage, people might still be able to harm others using it. For example, they might be able to glitch it so that the fast travel mat is placed in the air on top of a cliff - that way, the player spawns in and immediately falls to their death.
---
I really want the travel mat - don't get me wrong. I just wanted to mention that simply disabling player damage might not be enough
---
Ah cool thanks. Between that and the lucky hole mine I’m going to have a ton of lead and ammo!
---
Alright, I'll tell him about it. Thank you
---
I often spawn *underneath* the map and proceed to *fall up* onto the ground becoming crippled in the process. In many ways this is such a weird game.
---
I had previously thought about doing a wrestling ring as well, the Dirt Track seems appropriate since they already have stands for the audience. I guess the question is how did they make the ring? Because I feel like the elevation of a foundation floor + ramp is a little bit too high, unless they used floors that weren't snapped together. For ropes I've personally used connector cables and connector pylons on posts for turnbuckles.
---
Honestly interested in what it looks like, more so from a technical standpoint to see how certain elements have been tackled.
---
Heyo pacific, how the hell did you knew xD ?
---
I just need something that will make basically anything eat shit
---
But that’s only because he’s losing 2 units of plastic per bulk.
---
also use this if you haven't already  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
Nothing will change there. If they didnt have the foresight to have a simple contingency plan of "fudging the numbers" to save face then they wont have spent any time thought or resources in modifying the scenario for accounting for a failure. They clearly never even factored that in as possibility because they dont even understand how ridiculous the targets for some materials are nor the actual limitations there own game has in regards to acquiring them.
---
Honestly its depressing
---
you can probably get away with not using starched genes if you get all mutations anyway might need a bit of management (either add starched genes if you use radaway or stick to diluted and spam spoiled meat/toxic goo to get one back in case it is lost)
---
Shut up Bethesda, we know that’s you.
---
I think I would describe it as the devs only *run the game on* their development systems but don't actually *play* the game.
---
Initially i thought it was a typo and it was just a basic survive for 10 mimutes.. but apparently it wants you to be in the actual fire ring (or storm).
---
It also doesn't specify how many minutes. Apprently just 2 i believe. Was just confusing and stupid.
---
Top many people jumped on the 'Dupers will complete it' bandwagon, and when that didn't happen in the first hour it became 'Bethesda will auto-complete'. Either way it became an excuse not to take part.
---
Yes the target was set too high, and the minimum donation was also set too high, and the chosen materials were not easily sourced without specifically searching for them. But let's be honest and admit a large portion of the community appears not to have even tried and as its become clear just how badly its gone they've dug their heels in further.
---
Jeez, angry little boy aren't we?
---
The “why is my weight so high” question is an absolutely endless source of anxiety for me. I wish there was a way to sort by total weight, not just weight per item.
---
Yeah I had been building in places that were handy for fast travel, but I really wanted to try something in the mire, the spot I chose was probably much harder to work with than I expected, but it also meant I had to try and get creative to get around certain problems. I love the atmosphere here.
---
You complete all the quests for settlers and raiders to the point where you choose sides. You'll still get the stealth suit and can side with the raiders. That's how I did it :)
---
I Highly doubt that it will effect the base it self. They must have already made the model and how the finished product looks like. Doubt that they have made multiple different versions with "what if they fail this challenge"  versions. But we won't get that reward, which is a shame in and of it self, would be great for any BOS Camps in the future.
---
as far as I know, super duper will work with anything you craft except those items that use legendary modules..
---
Quake in your boots! For it is I, Todd Howard! I'm here to collect your soles!
---
The more you know my bad.
---
No! Take this you little bitch! *unsubscribes from 1st, and snaps my disc in half*
---
As for your questions about better armor and weapons: Scrap anything to learn mods for armor and weapons. Usually armor sells for a few caps only (prices for weapons are better), so just scrap it and sell all weapons you don't intend to use. You will need some perk cards equipped to actually apply higher tier modifications (for example gunsmith for guns), some modification plans can only be bought or found as drops from enemies.
---
Nice! The raider tree is such a good addition to any camp 👍🏼
---
tnx!
---
HA! Arrogant fool! You've already given the money for the game! The substitution doesn't matter for I will make events nearly requiring you to have infinite junk storage!
---
I’m a power armor junkie and was too deep into blowing my gold on t65 before I realized I could have a much better life with the secret service armor. I guess I’ll see you guys in another month or two lol
---
You can also get nearly 1500-2000 steel down in the south west 😃
---
You evil bastard! This is why I snapped my disk in half! After a thousand hours of your shit ENOUGH! IS! ENOUGH!
---
I recently switched to the “craft as needed” mantra when it comes to gunpowder. Been fine since. Just keep an eye on your acid and cloth supply in case you run low.
---
İts ok no problem :D
---
If you did not actually start it (talking to him in Rollins Camp), visiting the Ash Heap region should bring it back to your pip boy.
---
You will never your money back, peasant!
---
Lewis &amp; Sons Farming Supply (3 bags of cement) - 2 inside the barn with the PA station, 1 outside of it
---
Big Bend Tunnel and The Burrows have some too but  I can't remember how many.
---
Gnomes are great source - they're actually all over the place
---
Jokes on you, in the recent dupe wave I made £350! That’s more than 5x my investment into this game!
---
To be honest those who donated a lot during the steel phase are probably also grinding the concrete now but you just don't get nearly enough, with steel you can easily farm it by clearing out supermutants and scrapping weapons, with concrete you only ahve limited extractors and a few spots with bags which are empty a lot of the time now.
---
I've been putting common items in my vendor for 0 caps just to help others complete the SCORE daily. 
---
Usually plans I already know, that aren't rare
---
Salt or pepper etc.
---
Also garbage rewards for participating? Sure your first too make sense but the data mine of the rewards is a turn off too.
---
\&gt; How do I get to craft better armor, weapons...?    
---
You need to learn the Plan for each weapon or armor piece, then craft them at a workbench. You get plans from vendors, or as event rewards, or just find them in the world.   
---
You can loot or buy better weapons and armor than you can craft , because your crafted equipment won't have legendary effects.   
---
\&gt; How do I get to craft ... weapon mods?

Easiest way to craft a mod is with a "mod box" , you can find them in world or buy them from a vendor. after you have the mod box, just go to the modify option  at a workbench and you'll be able to apply it. You can also learn different mods from plans and scrapping weapons. Howevever every mod can only be learned one way. You can't learn a plan mod by scrapping, or find a plan for a scrapping mod. And some plans are insanely rare.
---
I agree with this, but when ever I craft with modules I still use super duper. Sounds silly but I always seam to get better rolls when I do ....
---
There is a terminal entry inside the Communist base under Mama Dolce that kind of explains it, I took a picture of it but never actually used it so I don't know how much it actually helps.
---
I'm betting they cheese it. It would be another bad PR bump in a long road of bad PR bumps. Every outlet will run an article titled something about how the games population is dead and the game is dead and so on and so fourth if what is only the second challenge isn't met.
---
Purified water for free, ammo 1 cap. Plans, ammo and aid items 90% off the value price.
---
Maybe already too late, but usually if you drop something else everything in a bag you dropped before in the immediate area will just transfer to the new bag. Not sure if that applies if you drop because you died, though
---
&gt;Heck make a 2 shot build where each piece of armor adds another projectile.
---
I love this idea! Even if it caps at 3, it'd still be amazing for full-health stealth/snipers like me!
---
**IMPOSSIBLE!** I'll have to carpet ban hundreds of players for this!
---
For those of us who don't use fast travel, however, the settlers are far and away the worst thing that ever happened to Appalachia...
---
MWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA... YOU CAN BAN ME ALL YOU LIKE FOOL, I DON’T CARE ANYMORE!
---
Why would they fudge the numbers? If they did and it became public it would be a greater slap in the face than what is currently happening. Bethesda deserve some criticism but so do the players who make excuse after excuse and expect Beth to bail them out.
---
Get rid of your water purifier then you will need those waters
---
PS4 with a roof covered in Mine cart planters?
---
I was at a camp like this earlier today, had a 'secret room' I dropped into covered in Mothman decor and a 1 star combat knife for free in the vendor. I took the treasure map but left the knife so someone else could have the same thrill. ;p
---
Why an orange dot?
---
some of the objectives are made not to be met
---
Way to motivate them, Calling them "Incels and "that that is all they are good for". I´m sure they will start lining up now donating.
---
Had a similar issue, in my case all of a sudden i had the "Apalachia" word across my screen, it only went away once i restarted the game.
---
I'll just ban the account you duped on! Therefore I can indirectly profit off of you!
---
Phooey. Ok
---
*confused look*
---
What? That account is empty.
---
You can't skip over this though, I am also stuck here. I even reloaded and closed/reopened game, nothing fixes this. Anyone have any ideas how I can reset it? I don't even get mole/wolf so wondering why I can't progress.. getting them there is no option to even give them.. I was thinking maybe but doesn't seem like it would work as well I have no targeted places for them to pop on the map when I get there.  
---
Hrmm... I cannot progress unless I get inoculated but I cannot get inoculated because the quest is stuck here and I already turned in the Ghoul blood and all.
---
My BF and I play together and have so much fun!!! He's way more advanced than I am, but he's patient and loves showing me the ropes!
---
PC
---
i think you are missing the point
---
What´s up with the downvotes?
---
Vanguard ap refresh. AA ffr or furious Ffr, with less vats cost. Fireproof, adrenaline, super sneaky. Drugs, strange in numbers, black magic. And possibly access to Tod Howard’s personal PC.....
---
Why should you take care when they don't care at all except for themself?
---
Especially at events you should take care the enemy's are dead before they interrupt the objective, if you called the legendarys and waited till they tag them all scavengers would be dead on the first legendary enemy.
---
Rifleman and heavy gunner have pretty much no synergy at all (per/ag versus str/int), I would not recommend this combination. Gunslinger/Rifleman or Heavy/2h melee would make more sense if you really want a mix.
---
**WHAT?!** That's not possible! Where'd all the illegal items go?!
---
I call her Mama Mrglrglmrgmrrlggg. Yes I played the World of Warcraft TCG and played Murlocks so I've had that name burned into my brain. Especially since the card Mrglrglmrgmrrlggg requires you to say it's name to use it's ability and some players were sticklers about you saying the name right, it's one I can never forget.
---
Nah I know they are greedy and had no intention of 'sharing' in the first place and were duping only for themselves. No motivation required since they won't donate anyways
---
Honesty just the first color that came to mind.
---
Once our of build mode the dot would go away. It's not visible to anyone.
---
From what I have heard, buying something at 0 caps does not count towards the daily. It might be better to set them at 1 cap.
---
I sold them fool
---
How do know?, Nvm I don't want to know you creepy little...
---
Thats a stupid way to go about it then still. So we have all the right to complain.
---
They have never been on sale, and likely never will be.
---
There are enough a-holes to go around it seems, if they are kids then I guess it's flexing their hormones, but if they are adults I feel sorry for them and their families.
---
You have to, since we get a vertibot power armor skin. At least its in the game files for a few weeks now.
---
Yeah makes sense, i have difficulty choosing, i want to be a sniper, but also a guy that runs in with heavy weapons from time to time.  Have you had any of those builds?
---
Glad to hear it worked out for you. 😃
---
I started doing it a few days ago when I noticed my 'buy 3' complete when I bought a water from a camp for 0 caps. Was a "Oh?" moment. 
---
Now you've got me curious if that was a bug. lol
---
It’s impossible to fail. Bethesda just tops us up. Don’t worry kitten.....
---
I ran up on him and another at Monaghah lookout. He was on the computer with his buddy looking out. I downed him first, his buddy looked panicked and tried to revive him. Both went down. I was shocked to see the name. 
---
Me - 1
---
Momento Mori - 1000000,000000
---
😂
---
Do the same thing with Uranium Fever. Pick up everything and waddle over to the Whitespring Station.
---
Yeah, maybe i need to choose, just wondering if there is any hybrid versionb out there anyone has tried. Doesn't need to be maxed out build
---
And thanks for your suggestions (:
---
But...but...you can not do that! You've violated the Terms Of Service! I'll that your account is banned and nothing else!
---
Perhaps I misheard. I might be wrong about this. I think I might need to try to test it the next time it pops up as a challenge.
---
Come on people, these goals auto complete even if we don’t make quota. Watch and see tomorrow....
---
i go there with excavator and farm minerals for the rest of the week. Fk the robots, if i pass near them maybe i repair one haha
---
Iono man. Had this once too. But i was fiddling with displays and vendors. Maybe only a vision glitch like mine. Try to get all your weapons from the stash and look thru them in your pipboy. My searched weapon appeared again.
---
HA HA HA HA HA! I already have the money I wanted Todd! I have defeated your ways by directly profiting from cheating and selling the results! RRRRREEEEEEEE!
---
 No need to carry a secondary weapon just bash the legendary once then back off - job done
---
you need to be fast but still don't worth the rewards
---
That’s kind of true, but only kind of. When I just placed my camp box the spawn was perfect, but when I actually built a house and some other structures, my spawn point changed and I get spawned in rocks without being able to move for few seconds
---
Don't push it, peasant! I may have to make you the first person I've taken to a court of law over violating the Terms of Service!
---
yep you can complain but on this one bethesda will put the fault on the community as they didn't gave enough even tho we all know that it s not really true
---
I wish. Harper's and Watoga would fill out a great 4 options.
---
The rewards may be far more relevant to low level players, which is odd as many won't have Atlas available as a Fast Travel point, but still there's absolutely no reason high level players can do at least one drop off in 4 days to keep the numbers rolling in.
---
okay good to know. Kitten...?
---
Thanks for this. I was looking for something like this since I've been farming nuke keycards as they keep flying over my camp and need more flux but wasn't sure were to nuke.
---
Yes, that's why I mentioned fall damage.
---
I really should learn to read comments before posting...
---
I hate col gusty with a burning passion. The assaultrons are easy, aim for the legs to demobile them then finish them off
---
I wouldn't say selfish attitudes, had they made the scrap stash available to everyone and not just FO1st, more people could and probably would have had a bigger stock for donations.
---
Why should those without FO1st have to walk around for 4 days gathering a specific resource? We can't stash them cause we don't have the space, we can't travel every 250 concrete, cause Fast Travel to Atlas isn't free and not everyone is loaded with caps.
---
It's more of a job to gather without FO1st, rather than playing a game for entertainment, which is what games were meant to be in the first place.
---
Bethesda should realise we don't want to do a chore when we start up a game, we want to have fun. It's not our fault that they assumed every player had 20k concrete, let alone make up that stupidly high goal.
---
I think the cork is slightly more do-able than concrete as it can be gotten from certain pipe weapons but all in all it's still ridiculous, as you said they put a lower target for the most common material, so it's pretty much set up to fail
---
If you want to address the issue with the walls and wires passing through for the players, you need to just increase the build budget. Double the current camp budget and everything else will work itself out. If we had enough space to build conduits we would.
---
Could you imagine if they added the Croc backpack as a reward!?
---
I did that in Fallout 4, but for some reason in 76 VATS won't let me target their legs?
---
That's pretty good of them if that's the case. Now I can spend my atoms on cosmetics!
---
Thats not a bug. Why on earth would you use a unique helmet like that to even test it? 
---
Did it give you a warning that the new "mod" would destroy the original?
---
I love those little dudes!
---
Just you try it, and I’ll have you in court for the horrible quality of your game, not providing the perks advertised when Fallout 1st originally came out, and taking my money for a subscription I couldn’t use while my account was suspended! How about *that,* huh?
---
I doubt it is even possible to gather that much concrete or cork as these are world spawns under modest competition. You practically need ten thousand distinct servers, all dedicated to looting the materials.
---
And bulk items
---
Assaultrons are a pain but you soon learn they have weak legs and can be Stealthed to death.
---
A high level Col Gusty with its armour piercing rounds can seriously ruin your day, especially as they often travel in pairs or even with an Assaultron for double the fun.
---
I got several t-45 and t-51 plans while delivering steel, plasma grenade also. Not sure about t-60
---
Too late to call a truce?
---
I'm level 170something. Concrete is rare so I dont collect much and its heavy so I bulk and sell whenever I hey close to 100. I had 75 before donating started. I worked yesterday and only have 80 today. I'd love to contribute even a little but I dont see myself getting anywhere near 250...
---
You'll be better off with 5 random Hunter/Mutantslayer/Zealot/Exterminator/Troubleshooter/Ghoulslayer pieces than going full vanguard.
---
I'd deal with the level balance if everything else was user friendly. When people are loading in 45 seconds before you sometimes it really kills my enjoyment.
---
I got a buddy to play with me today. He was lvl 10 when he finally logged in the same time i did. I was doing my daily of killing legendaries. I go to my favorite spot and there he is. two star lvl 65 scorchbeast.   
---
I tell him to fast travel to me and tag him, join in the fun.   
---
"is it safe?" he asks.   
---
"Sure is. I cleared all the scorched so just aim at the sky and pew pew pew.."   
---
He fast travels to me and pings it with his pipe pistol.   
---
I didnt plan this, but it was great. As we are killing the scorch beast it flies down and pisses the earth, which activated more scorched. Now he is running around trying to get away from them. I run over laughing when a freaking legendary sheepsquatch appears out of nowhere and starts attacking the scorched. The scorchbeast lands and starts pounding on the sheepsquatch. Now he is in the thick of it desperately trying to heal himself running away.  
---
He died. He calls me and says "YOU SAID IT WAS SAFE! YOU LIED TO ME!"  
---
Thats the wasteland for ya.
---
Now I have *you* under *my* thumb! I’ll let you loose if you fix the game rather than monetise the living shit out of it!
---
You need a specific perk card in perception to target limbs
---
There is a pc mod which removes the grass from ghillie skins, making it look exactly the same as the 300atoms skin.
---
I rather not buy it anyway since I think the secret service armor is too bulky. Maybe when a dark matte skin is available...
---
Have u got concentrated fire perk?
---
Thats a perk, but in my opinion just aim for the legs and blast away. It helps if you have an explosive legendary effect
---
Do I have to remind you I have better lawyers? I own a major company! I can get away with almost anything!
---
I'm at grafton Steel helping the little girl find her stupid toy 🙄🤦‍♀️ and can't get past this assaultron.
---
Most hated enemy. Mole rats, or rad scorpions. Hate it when they go where I can't kill them
---
Mirelurk Kings, purely because of that horrid noise they make
---
You need to have the correct perk equipped to target limbs, Concentrated fire under Perception is the one.
---
Not if I raid this sub and appeal to those of this place that haven’t been brainwashed by your previous games with a fundraiser...
---
I believe it does. And now it’s gone. Not a bug
---
does 500-750 count
---
lvl 52 in 7 days WTF
---
By The Nine! Not community backlash! Whatever do you need?
---
What is cheap by your definition? I sell mine for 300 a pop.
---
If anyone wants to come help me? Haha
---
I would never give any of my scarp for anything but maybe double XP as a new player. 
---
A beret?!?! WTF
---
I think we’ll get that stuff with instanced interiors.
---
Yeah I do! 🤔
---
That’s cheap or around average price range
---
Sources of concrete. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6ujsj/all_the_best_places_for_concrete_help_lock_down/
---
Very strange. Luckily I don’t have this issue anymore. Hated them at low level now I smash them before they even know I’m there. Boom!  Dead
---
A little too high for my budget bud 😔
---
Lucky! I'm still very low level and seem to die, alot! 😑
---
Go play any other mmo. Or games with voice chat that is actually used by players. You would be shocked how many girls are playing...
---
The low levels would like it more but need those resources more too and it will cost them caps if the font have a friend there. I'm pushing lvl 450 and I have 1st. I'll keep my resources for my base building (which I do often). The event has little to no benefits for higher levels. I don't need score, don't care about reskined items, don't like the RNG of the purveyor, etc. Especially when I've got the gear/guns I need, like a number of high levels do, what's the point? Because it's nice? For others? Nah, it's the wasteland.  I think we can at least agree that the event wasn't thought out too well. Either way, wish you the best out there if you're donating.
---
Mostly just being playful
---
Or you could buy a pc and experience a whole new world of bugs and exploits
---
There are no T60 plans in the reward list. That's why most of us high levels aren't interested.

A few pieces of this is game changing.
---
Lol yep it’s a fucker ain’t it. If it’s one specific assaultron...is the one on the quest I think in sugar grove. It can’t come up the corridor. So lure it. Run like crazy to the end of the corridor and hide. Wait till it fires then step out and blast it and take cover. Repeat until it’s dead
---
Nah. Been using photomode and PA just fine to solo
---
Can someone tell me how i can start donating? I dont know how/where.. do i need to do quests first?
---
Because its illegal and not allowed!!!11!
---
But deep down in their salty heart they downvote only because they are not able to build an underground camp...
---
If you take starched genes and plan to use them all (they are all good) and then take class freak just go to the abandoned ammo dump, just stand next to the barrels and soak rads until you get a mutation (even if you die just keep going until you get a mutation) then server hop, rinse and repeat. Note: if you have any scrap to pick it up if you die before server hopping.
---
Nah this is at Grafton Steel and it seems to find me wherever I hide 😒
---
Bruh less desirable doesn’t matter pvp players and griefers such as myself will take any claimed workshop doesn’t matter if it’s desirable. If it’s claimed chances are the owner wants it back if the owner comes I kill him and then take his loot it’s how it works.
---
They say everyone even, and special doesn't count, while they sadly does. Need to level separate character with nw build to be really effective. Ofc you can have fun without minmaxing, but there is several essential perks
---
im not sure but isnt there a shack with a terminal inside that contains some lore?
---
if so i think bethesda made it so that you can only build in places that dont contain any lore, so you cant lock other players out of content
---
Correct answer, I just want to add that certain items are buggy and indeed let the player place them into other camps. Settler and raider bottle lamps as example, a friend once placed  satellite dishes into my camp also.
---
I didnt even say I support or dont, but someone still downvotes. Stupid lol. I personally don't care about underground camps, but why do people? Makes no sense to me.
---
Thank you for the link but honestly it's too much work for a flag. I'm gonna stick to farming xp for score...I wonder of Bethesda even considered people might be too busy with legendary run to roam the map for hours on end?
---
Sadly not, even with 1st and a hoarder mindset I only managed to get up to 1k concrete. It does not help many are deterred by the lack of actual reward via the provision rewards as they are a watered down repeat of a previous events.
---
molerats are the worst.
---
I’ll let you play the game so you can see the most annoying bugs for yourself. Secondly, also have a look at this subreddit, there’s a load of annoying bugs that have been in the game since beta here. Buff some of the useless weapon prefixes like Mutant’s and the situation specific ones like Zealots so they actually do some real damage. Bring back Survival mode, and put PvP back to how it was pre patch 20. And make a trade system between other players where both players have to put the item(s) they’re trading into the trade window and both have to confirm they want this to happen like *any normal online game.*
---
Idiots. Simple as it is.
---
When they see someone is doing something that is not directly allowed from authority's they think its a crime and must be punished.
---
I hope there will be an other to get the rewards.
---
I think this will expose some resources that need to be made more plentiful.
---
at least flamer fuel is not called 10mm anymore 😅
---
All I can suggest in the cripple legs tactic. U move the target with the right stick. As far as I know it’s not broke. Vats. Click right and blast it’s legs
---
For a long time that’s all I did. I had zero clue about ‘builds’ (still really don’t). I like melee and I’ve been using the Unstoppable Monster since I got it as a reward from that god awful survival mode. I didn’t realize it was considered a bloodied weapon until I started to try to trade gear. So for the past few weeks I’ve been on a quest to get some good unyielding rolls. It’s just starting to get frustrating.
---
*I.* *WILL.* *NEVER!*
---
Segmented shutdowns also allows users to keep playing while some servers reboot.
---
I have Healing Factor so regenerating pieces are a no-go for me. Anything with damage *reduction*. Armor and perk cards.
---
I used to roll with a full set of Vanguard armor only to find out that the extra damage resistance wasn’t as beneficial as I thought. Ghoul/Mutant Slayer, Exterminator, Troubleshooter... these specialized pieces end up serving you better in the long run. 
---
As for perk cards... Blocker is good for mitigating melee damage. Up to 45% damage reduction from ghouls and others. 
---
Also, anything that could potentially save some perk points. Armor with faster action point refresh is a plus. Armor with weapon weight reduction as well. All of these things allow you to fine tune your build better than you thought you could.
---
Side Note: Mutations... Get some. 
---
You have regenerating pieces so I can assume you don’t have many (or any) mutations. Healing Factor eliminates the need for regen armors. This will again allow you to opt for something better suited.
---
Mutations do have negative effects to keep in mind. The Class Freak perk card will reduce the negatives (up to 75%). Starched Genes will ensure that you don’t lose the mutations you have. Radaway and decontamination showers are nothing to worry about. Rad-X will suppress the mutations for a few minutes though.
---
Class Freak and Starched Genes requires 5 perk points (in Luck). This would seem counterintuitive to optimizing a build. For me, the good outweighs the bad. Plus, they make the game so much more fun.
---
Are you on Xbox? I can come help
---
Your friend lied melee is super easy, but you need to eat certain foods that you don't have easy access to till late game.  I can one hit any mob in the game with melee, while it takes 10s of rounds to kill them with a gun.  I've punched for over 10,000 damage depending how many buffs I stack.  The game is super hard up till you get your full damage spec going and gear to match.  You should scrap every non legendary weapon you find once you are done using them (get scrapper perk to get more material) every time you break something there is a chance to learn a new mod for that item.  You'll also need perks in intelligence to craft some (lvl 5 minimum for the hardest to craft).  If you are on PC hit me up and I'll make you a full suit of armor for every 10 levels (might make the game boring) and weapons to match.
---
I dont run the sneak perks, just escape artist.  My character is a pistol build so dont have enough room in agility. However when on a team,agility is at 25. Between the armor and 25 agility this character does very well in terms of not being detected.
---
I will say my alt who is currently a bloodied rifleman with unyielding and no sneak perks is damn near invisible all the time. But youre talking about 40 agility when on a team. 
---
I really need to donaome formal tests though.
---
Yeah it’s not to sneaky is it lol.
---
As long as the annoying short time-limit gets removed I'm cool with whatever they give us.
---
Why would they? BEcause they are trying to make this game look good, there is no live counter, no in game counter, it's manually updated daily. If we fail all challenges what would that say about the state of the game, how would that make them look and their game? I think they have many reason for fudging the numbers and have shown to have been untrustworthy and sometimes frankly lying about this game.
---
I thought I had saw one and I've tried sending one to you as well yesterday. The social section of the game leaves a lot to be desired. I'll continue to keep an eye out and just sent another one myself.
---
What’s the number for Concrete?
---
Yep that’s what I’m saying. If your agility is high enough u can get rid of the sneak perks and the sneak armour stacks. If your agility is 30+ with bloodied and Uny I seem to be invisible pretty much then and on a team I can stand in front of a landed sb and not come out of caution
---
Oh my, that sounds large. Do tell more
---
The latest call is 100,000...
---
What you're trying to tell me that server hopping concrete bags to turn in for alcohol and plans you already learned a year ago isn't worth your time?! Get out of here.
---
I most hate mole rats. They are just such a nuisance. Assaultrons will kick your butt early on though.
---
Yeah I'm on xbox
---
Ha, im on xbox.
---
Easy getting plastic though, just run through west tek. There are so many laser snipers, and they give 11 plastic each. Much better then pain stakingly picking up every knife and fork in watoga high school.
---
I havent tried simply because I dont want to
---
Ugh, I remember that one. I came across it before I started using my instigating explosive double barrel and it. Just. Kept. Killing. Me.
---
I’m with you. Only thing I run from and Yogi bears, they scare the crap out of me.
---
How long have you been playing fo76?
---
I get lags on a R5 3600x, 64gb, and installed on a NVMe 2 with 3gb tx rate.
---
What's your GT? I'll join you
---
ViciousC30
---
You need 36 bags of cement to get 250 concrete. At best you can find 9 bags in single place (Monorail elevator) and if no one else has taken any of them anywhere you might get the 36 bags in one server.
---
We need 600 000 times of 250 concrete to complete (150 000 000 concrete).
---
Most of the players that could contribute have nothing to gain from the challenge, apart from the steel banner for the camp, as they all ready have all the plans available from the loot boxes. I'm with them personally, but did empty all my concrete for three boxes that gave me water and grenades, yayy. Not doing that again.
---
So, in the end we need to rely on dupers and hackers to get us through this and next milestone, as they are the only ones able to get enough enough of the materials in the given time.
---
I killed it!! Thanks guys! I took its legs out haha
---
Omw, still at grafton steel?
---
The settlers gold machine is outside. One less loading screen \o/
---
Yeah im still here haha
---
Just noticed that, now if I didnt have to press back through all my selections to stop using the damn thing
---
They'll be lucky to build 37.5 foundations considering the lacklustre response of so many players.
---
I managed to kill it though! So don't feel like you have to come now lol
---
No, I don't think I will.
---
Community goal is 150 million concrete, 1 concrete foundation needs 4 concrete = 37,500,000 foundations
---
Convenient
---
I didn’t like Paige’s attitude from the start and just sided with the raiders. Now I’m bummed I missed out on all those quests and there’s one daily to try to raise my rep with them. Slow going. Trying to get those gauntlet plans.
---
So how would a base that big be constructed? A bunch of CAMPS placed in just the right place around eachother to make it appear seamless?
---
They weren’t last time. I was disappointed as well.
---
I don’t really have a huge problem with them as a stealth rifleman, but if I’m crouching directly under a street lamp or strong light, I’ve been spotted a few times.  The most common spot is at Red Rocket Megastop.  The boss assaultron/gutsy can be challenging to engage, because several doorways leading into the outdoor dining area have spotlights and you can go into danger immediately.
---
When this happens, I don’t try to brute force the situation or shoot my way out with zero cover.  I’ll back into the restaurant or kitchen, putting cover between myself and the laser, sprint towards a back entrance and try to regain caution.  The assaultron will start chasing, and stop firing the head laser in the process.  I’ll then be able to shoot from a shadowed position with some cover, and take advantage of sneak attack damage to put it down quickly.
---
If I’m playing my heavy gunner, who is a high health junkie build, I rely more on defensive perk cards and direct firepower.  I use dodgy, ricochet and one rank of born survivor.  They eliminate a tremendous amount of incoming damage from gutsies and assaultrons.  My health will go down, but between junkies 50cal DPS and perks, I can always tear through them faster than they can tear into me.
---
I noticed. It sucks I can’t turn in legendaries just because I applied a skin to it
---
It triggered for me with a SS chest piece, but alas, I still only received one 😔
---
You may know this but you don't have to repair the reactor if you hack the terminal in the reactor room. Having a full set of Troubleshooter's armor, modded to be stealthy allows you to shrug off any attack from robots. Reprogram the turrets to shoot everything and keep the robots busy. Once in the control room, go around and destroy all the turrets so that they don't attack the launch control robots. After that, there's only a few bots per wave and I just murder them while hidden. There are glitches that get you through much of the boring stuff but let s not get into that here. Launched two nukes today on my private server. One at Morgantown for High Radiation Fluids, then one in the Bog, northwest of Watoga to get a ton of Crimson flux.
---
Imagine that. BoS trying to get up in the morning and put their shiny boots to some innocent throats, but they can only get as far as "your camp could not be placed" ad nauseum.
---
We could use the concrete workshop but it would still be ultra tough.
---
They were, idk what this dude is talking about
---
I can’t even imagine it
---
Project Paradise, Free Range, Scorched Earth, Encrypted and Heart of the Swamp are the only ones I enjoy doing tbh. 
---
I cant do events like Guided Meditation and Path to Enlightenment. They are just so damn boring.
---
Magazines for 10 caps is my gift to other players.
---
Nor should people be participating in a event like this when people have limited carry weight / stash space.
---
Raiders vs settlers in this game are like NCR vs Caesars legion in NV.  One side is fleshed out and the game pushes you to side with them.  The other side is intriguing, but doesn't offer as much and ends up disappointing.
---
Maybe you already looted it?
---
There is a invisible counter for openworld items that must be looted before they get lootable again.
---
I think it was 120 or 180items without a timer. If you loot one log, didn't log in for a year and then try to loot the same log again it won't work till you looted 120/180 other items and then relog once.
---
This.  If it’s legendary, I break stealth and bash it to wake it up.  If not, I just shoot it for xp and keep moving.
---
While giving you no exp at the same time.
---
Everyone loved Weasel dude.  There should be a quest to fix her voice or at least add more words.
---
Yeah I scraped a serrated cultural blade. I'm sad I can learn it to apply it to the legendary version
---
I wince when I think of the cool legacy stuff I scrapped last year. The only relic I have is an explosive Tesla - makes a great mob killer when converted to shotgun.
---
Because concrete is harder to come by and people have found out the rewards are garbage.
---
Yes, when did they remove it?
---
I played it a couple of times waay back when the game was released. I guess it was just too buggy?
---
Because legendary effects were just thrown around at random with next to no thought, and any "builds" are purely coincidental and formed out of necessity. Assuming they knew what they were doing is giving them both too much *and* too little credit at the same time.
---
Yes
---
Indeed, hence the concern :D
---
Is that still working? The last few times, even with tents in place the scorched didn't spawn at the generator. I assumed it had been patched.
---
1 scrap = 0.04, x250 = 10lb exactly the same as steel. Lack of stash space is just another excuse.
---
I’ll be jumping on in a few minutes if you still need help
---
The numbers make no sense. You would assume that Bethesda would have knowledge of what is farmed a day, and can search the server to tell how much of a resource is in peoples stashes and scrap boxes (if applicable) 
---
This event is badly thought out, the time scale to do it is way too small. When people are complaining about stash space constantly how many people are going to go out of their way to stockpile over days and weeks these resources for this event? It is like this event is assuming the Firsters will be doing the vast majority of the heavy lifting, simply because they have had months to stockpile scrap (assuming of course, they actually have been, and are willing to offload the hoarded scrap)
---
I have to assume that players who have a scrap box have stockpiled massive amounts in the scrap box of concrete etc and this is skewing the numbers to make Bethesda think that it is remotely plausible to somehow gather hundreds of millions of fairly uncommon scrap in a couple of days. It should not be up to the Firsters to pull this much weight and its senseless to think that we would be given a goal that honestly i can not see how it could be accomplished without massive stockpiles being given up. It is almost like they want to encourage the dupers to focus their efforts on a community goal rather than their selfish goal for once.
---
We do not have good numbers to say how many players there are for this game but i would love to see a break down for exactly how much each player is expected to contribute to each of these goals.
---
Yes please, I literally just need to revive someone
---
I have a level 8 mule with a lvl5 ve15 laser rifle and lvl 1 unyielding ap leather set. I love it when someone bash me...
---
Update: did two nuke runs today and with your advice I got through with zero trouble. Thanks!
---
Hey there,   
---
It seems like you have gotten wrong how the stash works. You get 800 in stash space. Nothing more gets added if you add more stash boxes or crates. Adding more stash boxes and crates just make you able to access the same inventory. Furthermore you can go into your stash at the stash boxes at train stations and red rocket stations, also in other peoples stash boxes at other peoples camps. And you can delete all stash boxes in your camp and make new ones and it wont delete anything in your stash. Hope this helps.
---
That is  quite the understatement 😂 *cough* simple Text Chat *cough* 
---
Allrighty :) See you soon, hopefully
---
I’m thinking more of the ambush PvP player.  The most notorious example was the Sunshine Meadows food factory.  It was pretty common for a time for a PvP player to clear out enemies at the food factory and wait for someone to show up.  This happened on the PC, so I’m not sure if console players have the same experience.
---
The only people who are guaranteed to have a bad experience are people who want to use a workshop for resources.
---
Bags and gnomes.
---
Just go to modify and remove the skin (by applying the standard skin) and then you can turn them in.
---
I’ll second the gunslinger/rifleman build. Been playing around with pipe revolver and pipe bolt action on my second alt. Fun times since both sets of perks affect the weapon if you put a rifle stock on it. Stand pipe pistol is not affected; needs to be revolver or bolt action. 
---
Combine the above with a junkie build for even more fun :)
---
I highly doubt more than 1% of players actually cancelled their subscriptions.  If I’ve learned anything from Reddit, it’s that bullshit, petulance and hyperbole are standard issue.  It’s like a bratty kid threatening to run away from home.
---
I have a furious power attack damage one. I had a vampires a long time ago but it was like level 25 so I got rid of it
---
I don't think that we can do it at all... I have Fallout 1st and hoard stuff all the time and I only had 600 concrete... I still donated at least 250 to at least know that I contributed what I could...
---
Seems like it would be a pretty straight forward addition.   But then, thinking about what they did to the ammo converter, maybe its above them.
---
They haven't added them yet
---
Lack of stash space another excuse? I've got 800lb worth of space, shared across every JUNK/AMMO, along with weapons and armor that already take up a huge amount of that space. I'm not dropping all my other scrap just to store up a tiny bit of concrete for a reward, that I could get by simply looting a building in the middle of nowhere.
---
Give everyone unlimited scrap space, then we can talk about how it's another excuse. This game is very anti-collector, unlike older FO games. 10lb may seem very little for you for 250 worth of concrete, but when limited to only 800, that 10 lb is very hard to give up.
---
100lb wouls be 2500 concrete, not even close to what I am willing to give up in my stash. Not when that stash is also used for items I am trying to sell, or  simply mod/craft weapons and armor.
---
So no, it's not an excuse. It's just Bethesda being unreasonable with their goals. Not giving us the proper tools unless we subscribe to a silly subscription.
---
PvP is a dying breed and honestly griefing is the only way to keep it somewhat alive so no means is below me I’ll do whatever to ruins someones day even if it mean waiting 10 minutes to have some level 200 food build walk and then massacring him to get the bulk junk he has, and further more I have to builds a real pvp build which I’ll monopolize the entire servers workshops and my poop build which is a pvp build which rely on Explosive pipe rifles, Combat rifles and Raider armor/trapper armor
---
Each time flatwoods was selected I barely find enemy's, the kill feed shows a lot of ppl who just die without being shot and at the end of the rounds we always have to search at least 5 cowards hiding without even trying to fight us.
---
Thats no fun at all...
---
Oh yes Yao Guais. They tank dmg fairly good and if they decide to roll out a 25hit claw combo you waver to death. Still, ShoopDaWhoop and Colonel kickass are worse.
---
Honestly I'm really disappointed... this was their first chance to introduce some cool bos stuff and they give us reskinned presents as a reward?
---
The only 'mixed' build I run (and enjoy very much) at the moment is a gunslinger/rifleman, the others are focused (unarmed, hw, commando, 2h...). But nothing stops you from pulling out some bfg now and then, damage will just be not great.
---
The only good answer.
---
Trust me, they are. You need explosives to catch them on the landing, otherwise you better hope your aim is REALLY good. And if they have the high ground AND then jump, you can basically just disconnect and queue again. Shit’s just broken af...
---
Lol, ShoopDaWhoop like it.
---
We're not gonna make it,and the cork as well. We know this since they announced them. Even long term 1st players barely have 1k of those materials because you hardly even need them. It's just impossible to reach.
---
I agree about the scrap box. But he made it sound like there is a lot. Apparently his problem is nice camp items.
---
I have 1st and donated 10k steel only to find the rewards where garbage and had to dump everything I got on the ground because I was over encumbered.
---
I have about 15k concrete but it's a waste of time trading for provisions I'm just going to dump anyway.
---
No quests, just go to the ATLAS observatory in the Savage Divide, there are a few donation boxes around the site.
---
Because mutations have so little downside and provide a boost in and of themselves it would be OP
---
I don't know man, displaying a single value out of a database onto a web page?  Seems like pretty complicated stuff, cutting edge even...
---
/s
---
Charred Feral Ghouls, someone tell me why their weak ass slaps do more damage than any other attack in the game
---
Most annoyingly is the one which requires me to Alt-F4 the game. You die, and respawn but are stuck and cannot move and it still asks you to choose a respawn location. The only place to choose is Vault 79 as there are no other locations showing on the map. You cannot choose Vault 79 even if you wanted to because you're now overencumbered (as if the half-life/death instance isn't registering your armor). With no way to respawn you can sit there and continue to take damage and continue the cycle, or Alt-F4 the game and lose your junk.
---
It has already been nerfed and is pretty level, either use it yourself to or GiTgUD
---
Mutations have massive benefits.  People take them regardless of the "mutants" legendary effect.
---
Meanwhile addictions have exactly zero benefits and only penalties.  No one actively goes out and tries to get addictions unless they are using junkies weapons.
---
So yeah while it might be one thing for mutants to be better or to stack up to a point, if it was equal to junkies or better it would make junkies obsolete.
---
Personally I think making it something like:
---
* Weapon effect: 5% damage per mutation capped at 25%
---
* Armor effect: 3 dr/er per mutation capped at 15
---
Something like that.  make it better but not a complete replacement for junkies which has much more downside or vanguard/bolstering that are conditional.
---
Yes!! A whole weasel questline is a much needed addition, kind of like the becket or commander quests. She’s definitely the best raider and I’d love having her at my camp
---
Point 1) and 3) are worthless, considering I’m running a heavy. I’m not going to respec my main character’s SPECIAL just to make the same NW cancer build that all the commando fuckers are running. Frog legs has to go and marsupial has to be added to the NW mutation pool. That would solve problem.
---
Where's the page that keeps track of amounts?    
---
I am donating the minimum of each material.   I figure if we each did that, maybe we'd make it.   (If not, then we'll see if they autocomplete it.)   But with zero new rewards dropping in the crate for experienced players and the challenge goals themselves being, "meh", I'm just not motivated to do more.
---
Yup
---
My experience is a bit different.  
---
Levels &lt;50 are untouchables. 
---
Levels 51-150 very often *do carry* absurd amounts of junk (I once popped a guy with 900lb...), on PC that is; maybe it has something to do with the absurd grind for moar levels, so the new-ish players are perhaps overleveled for their own good, too confident and/or not carefeul enough. 
---
Levels 150+ will often engage in a nice fight and generally contribute to exciting emergent gameplay, sometime with pals, though group pvp is bugged atm. They too sometimes carry junk, but not nearly as much.
---
Not with armor.  The Fixer effect stacks with Harder To Detect, but multiple HTD don’t stack with each other.
---
I have 1st but can't be bothered trading it in for crap to dump on the floor.
---
I think it is a ridiculously arbitrary and unrealistic target, and cork is even worse. It just really shows that none of the devs actually play their own game - if they did, they'd know how damn hard it is to find some of these resources in the quantities they expect. And let's face it, nearly all dupers are selfish pricks so they're not gonna share their crap.
---
Yes it is. I have learned both the Ultracite gattling laser and the Ultracite laser pistol/rifle. And before you ask no i don't know where to get said plans, mine came out of holiday gifts.
---
Omg yes 😂
---
I just do a stealth rifleman with barbarian and it works fine. My rifle isn’t even legendary and can still do 1000 dmg sometimes.
---
Good explanation. Thanks. As you say I think a small bonus per mutation would make sense. 
---
Cheers
---
Yes it does. Mutants should definitely stack - maybe 5% per mutation up to a max of 2%. It would also be reasonable to add a "Diurnal" effect to contrast Nocturnal at the cost of needing to find more gear. Weightless is basically redundant now that the Chinese Stealth Suit has been implemented. Stalker's on melee weapons is about as useful as Quad would be on melee, and should be removed from the pool. And either something to contrast with Unyielding, or make it so that it doesn't affect exp gain (INT) and skill-checks.
---
It would be very easy to balance this game, but "easy" is beyond the reach of these baboons unfortunately.
---
Agreed, For me levels 29 - 45 were hell. Having no build, shitty weapons and armor, no real concept on how to manage my hunger thirst and spending an hour everyday just to get enough water, crops to sell to the vendor boots at the train stations.  Now a level 202, i have acquired two legacies, many god roll weapons, full set of SS, am always at full caps if i want, do one brahmin run or leader of the pack event and have enough meat for a day or two. It gets ridiculously easy once you have gotten used to it. So much that i started a new character just to feel the struggle again.
---
Okay cool, thanks for the info! Are you on ps4 by chance?
---
Rule 10
---
You might want to try the market sub. Though chances of getting one for caps is slim
---
Doesn’t seem to work with bulking unless that changed.
---
I'm sticking to my maroon beret I hated shaving it but hey it looks decent
---
At the quakecon livestream pete hines and the lead developer claimed they play the game at least once a week with everyone who is working on the game aswell at their lunchbreaks sometimes. Hines said he prefere to just jump into random worlds and mind his own business rather playing with his coworkers. 
---
Sure they do...
---
They used to work fine at launch before they got removed. I had one on top of my CAMP at one point and it's not like I fell through it while loading or anything.
---
As a matter of fact i am.
---
Step aside! I can solo this event for everyone.
---
They should have made a new bulk item; “Atlas Donation” that was made up of various scrap. 10Steel, 5 concrete, etc. Then just made the goal be a certain number of packages...
---
Hold the "back" button: I use an XBoxOne controller with my PC and it's "B"
---
Good to hear mate- destroy the presents though.
---
Look it up.
---
So that why after Best events and all nukes, servers feels so empty.
---
Maybe not more events, but overhaul existence ones, scale rewards and enemies. Like Wolf horde, everyone doing it just for daily score... Loot is atrocious, rewards are not worth it. At least treasure notes should be in every events imo...
---
I’ve got an alright suit of 3star uny secret service, but losing the full set of shadowed mods is a noticeable difference from my old piecemeal leather/metal/scout suit.  The SS is sitting in the stash while I VERY slowly put together a full uny Thorn suit.
---
They never said Atom Shop. They said they were already working on it. With all the backlash associated with the change, it’ll likely either be implemented with a patch or perhaps be a free Atom Shop item.
---
Im in that exact same situation haha
---
4 or 5 bags on the gorge bridge, at the truck with all the rad barrels...
---
Steel should've been the last resource needed, much easier for the insane amounts
---
It's a benefit. You can prevent yourself from accidently scrapping a favorite piece.
---
The plans are not tradable. Neither is the weapon
---
Ahhh thanks anyways sorry for the trouble
---
Great Scott! Surely the flux capacitor should come into play somewhere with this...
---
OK, manged to test drinking vs collecting and I was wrong, although discovered something else at the same time.
---
If I drink from a water pump, the "5 rads" warning appears for a couple of seconds and I hear several radiation sound effects.
---
If I collect instead, the "5 rads" warning does appear but only briefly and the sound effect stops quickly.
---
So I guess the idea is that if we collect, we're only exposed for a brief time and accumulate fewer rads. Scintillating stuff!
---
Lode bearing, and that one with motherlode. Best recource farming, tho yesterday Motherload was empty...
---
Thankfully not everything is for sale and you need to work for it :)
---
I will
---
Plans are available in Watoga Trading post.
---
I guess because it was pvp event with attackers and defenders of fort (i beleive kinda like tdm), but anyway they could make it super fun. All the had to do is if players could ONLY use black powder rifles, old revolvers, tomahawks, shovels and pickaxes,revolutionary swords etc
---
I actually really wanted that BoS banner/sign for my camp to try and make it look more BoS, but I pretty much guessed we weren't going to come anywhere close to getting it.
---
You know, I think this event was set up to fail.     
---
125M steel  
---
150M concrete  
---
200M cork  
---
In difficulty to farm, steel &lt; concrete &lt; cork, and yet the goals we are supposed to meet are higher as material increases in difficulty.   It's the exact opposite of what you'd set those limits at if you wanted the event to succeed.
---
Surprise bears are the endgame
---
From now on they shall be named the Brotherhood of Cork
---
Great to know, thanks.
---
You can't offer treasury notes.
---
No one can drop the weapon for you without using a cheat tool.
---
You don't NEED the gun.
---
I'll manage, thanks for offering though :)
---
Ok thanks I’ll delete my post then
---
I'm SO tired of this. I cannot in any way comprehend why they won't give us a fast travel target like the welcome mat in workshops/fo4.
---
Its really where the whole failure starts.
---
Enclave officere here!
---
Wearing my Enclave uniform, they didnt nottice! 
---
Man i want ENCLAVE  event... 
---
I love BOS but not those and not fully.
---
Future Tek skin bugs out so your camp doesn't show on the map
---
Yeah, well, my "massive amount" of concrete in my scrap box amounts to about 1.5K.  Not very massive.   I don't go on collecting junk obsessively once a decent cushion has been established, and I'm never the only one to do anything.   I know there have to be many more like me.
---
I guess dupers duped steel, lead, screws, plastic etc but not concrete... i dont see millions of concrete happening any time soon
---
This perk needs to function like a dbl jump or some shit I hate wasting it on like a Fucking kerb
---
Absolutely.   I said the same thing.   The logic is backwards regarding amounts and farming difficulty.
---
I haven’t had a vending machine set up for months.  I’m almost always between 25-30k caps.  I have to visit others to avoid hitting 30k.
---
I typically save plans, a couple dozen extra water and rad meds while I play, find a lvl 2-30 player when I log in for the night and unload it all for them, typically while I complete the buy three items daily challenge.
---
Well have the bos met the enclave before this?
---
Correct
---
Schrödinger's content. 
---
It's there, but it isn't there.
---
This community is amazing, I can look past some of the flaws because the people are so awesome.
---
They need to think of something because at this point its a safe bet Cork will be much much worse and plastic may well struggle too since a lot of players use plastic and put in effort to keep up to their own needs without wanting to pass any of it over. Theres a solid chance the remainder of Project Alpha will fail.
---
Yeah futuretek camp makes your blip dissappear, remove the skin and relocate. I had this same issue and noticed it after I had built my house on top of Seneca rocks.
---
How about the bug where you can't lot a variety of plants and ores
---
I'm pretty sure if we earn it, it becomes a free unlock in the shop.
---
That’s how they fight the scorched. They get big cement mixers and put them in front of fissure sites and we need to defend them.
---
Don't pick any more up.  You can re-use ones you already have.
---
Ash pile or meat pile bug was introduced patch 21, although there is some contention to this on this sub, in my anecdotal experience if there are no energy weapon user the FPS remain stable, with a few ash piles I end in a slide show.
---
Yeah its awful. Ive even seen piles pixelate because it cant even render the graphics properly anymore and its choppy af. Line in the Sand isnt any better
---
The insult bot. He hurts more than any other in this game.
---
The included tournaments on the tea0
---
Can confirm, Line in the sand, when done propetly it can give you ~2000 steel from weapons with scrapper perk card
---
Mama Murphy? *the* all seeing god?
---
I run a mixed heavy and commando build.  The commando part of the build would be pretty disappointing though if it wasn't for the fact I am using meta rifles, which is basically what you were asking to avoid.
---
If you want to snipe occasionally you can always find yourself a nice gauss rifle.  Decent ranged damage without a bunch of cards.
---
FINALLY
---
Thanks, how do we know about that ?
---
Nobody in crater hates me. Sure meg is not happy I took the gold but all the others love me....or are dead.
---
Thankyou! I appreciate the tips!
---
Winter is coming...
---
That's exactly my CAMP method - I want people to wonder for just a second. 
---
I want more objects - they don't need to have a function. I want cars, motorcycles, tractors, military rigs. I want more bushes and trees and vines that will snap to your walls. I want wood piles, fishing and hunting racks, animal cages, I want those pipes and pumps to snap to my exterior walls, I want ground clutter (barrels, buckets, boxes) and I want more Atom Shop or ingame stuff like that junkyard bundle.
---
I'm perfectly okay with people making their CAMPS any way they want - I'm not criticizing people with nice houses, spaceships and all that. But for me, give me the ruined look.
---
Nope, glitched fine for me yesterday.
---
This. I avoided the game at launch after hearing nothing but bad reviews but once it was added to GamePass there was literally no reason for me to not try it. 
---
A few weeks and 80 something hours of game time later and I’m hooked! The variety of game play options is what keeps me coming back, if I want a chill experience I’ll just go for a wander in the wasteland gathering resources, hunting or just exploring what the game has to offer. If I want something more action packed I’ll pick anyone of the events happening all over the map, wander down into the cranberry bog or try take down a scorchbeast solo which at my lowly level is quite a grind but satisfyingly addictive all the same. 
---
Just like just about every other fallout game in the series, it’s not perfect, but if you enjoy the franchise, you’ll enjoy this post apocalyptic survival and camping simulator.
---
Not sure if it has been mentioned but there are loads of gnomes in the garden at the Generals Steakhouse
---
I think a lot of players are more concerned with xp in Radiation Rumble and just kill everything until the event fails.  The event xp isn’t that great, the end rewards aren’t all that valuable and most can’t be bothered to deal with the rads while collecting ore.
---
If I see the participants are trying to get ore, I’ll help.  If they’re just xp farming, that’s fine with me, too.
---
I’ve only participated a couple times since the last patch.  After a few minutes the lag is so bad from all the meat piles that it’s unplayable.  I’ll just skip it until the issue is addressed.
---
I see that sooo much in this game. Robots scavengers mirelurks scorched ghouls cows...half the time they render in then suddenly fold in half and keel over dead.  
---
Watched the mirelurk queen hop in the air and die too.  Theres something about the map that causes random collisions.  Sometimes when Im sprinting down the road, Ill suddenly stop and make a sound like I took damage.  Its weird as hell.
---
The BOS will still show up no matter what we do.
---
I guess I'm lucky, I've been fine
---
I like to spawn under the mountains or in the floorboards personally...
---
No one likes PVP because the fighting mechanics in Bethesda games games are hot trash. I have never even had anyone else show up to Monster Mash and when I log on NW for dailies it's always matches of like 30 out 52 people. Fallout probably has the worst shooting in any modern game, I probably wouldn't play if it wasn't for vats.
---
so like an example would be an executioners multi purpose axe + 1S, 40% faster swing speed max lvl?   I am actually asking because I got one and know one seems to want it.
---
I might be talking out of my ass. But I was under the impression the progress tracker was only updated daily, and not updated over the weekend. Deffinately curious to see where it will sit when they adjust it today. Someone please correct me if it updated on saturday or sunday though
---
Never happen ... too many flamingo units, would exceed the build budget
---
Posts like this just cement the idea of just how out of touch with the industry this subreddit is
---
where do I get the beret?? I donated thousands of steel and I never got it. how do I get it??
---
Right? Same here. No problems.
---
I will bet money if you did a poll among players who are not on this sub, a pretty sizeable number of them wouldnt even know there is an event on. There was no quest pop up to draw attention to it and there should have been. In FO4 every significant update that added content drew attention to it when you logged back in for the first time after updating. You would have a quest marker or some kind of objective on screen. I dont understand at all why they didnt. 
---
Even if they are among the few who may have noticed it mentioned in that little square at the top right of the load in screen thats usually utilised to advertise atom shop crap, they will have arrived to find a BOS fanboy npc with an uninteresting backstory and wonder why they should even care. 
---
Considering this event is supposed to herald in a sizeable part of future content then it required far more effort in its in game promotion that what we got. Even the presence of a bloody in game progress bar might have helped somewhat because theres a whole psychological draw to actually making something progress. Unless you know theres a link on Beths website (and most people on this sub dont even know theres one) you get no feedback at all how far along the progress even is, never mind that its failing.
---
Players arent at fault.
---
Maybe, my assumption is that they just want to annoy us players once more.
---
They are testing out how they can fuck with their players with the less amount of shitstorm for their upcoming games, using fallout 76 as a test field.
---
If they were going to cheese it, they wouldn't have given such a low number for the first day. Way too much suspicion
---
Stalkers is 100% vats hit chance if not in combat
---
125 million steel is 125 million walls. The Brotherhood base will be inpenetrable
---
The brotherhood arrive and setup either way, these challenges were purely for the community rewards
---
I should also add that the heavy gunner uses power armor, which provides a flat 40% damage reduction alone.  Top that off with 30% from Dodgy, 20% from Lone Wanderer, plus 18% chance to take 0 damage from Ricochet and even the antiarmor Gutsies take off little chips of HP instead of big chunks.
---
The fact that they say they are surprised tells me they must not play their games much. I've never played Fallout and thought to myself "hmm, I bet this janky ass shooting system would be great for pvp" There's 1000s of other games that do guns right, Fallout is still basically Oblivion with guns...
---
I would imagine so, the provisions in ingame terms are just what some random person who's never met them before thinks what they need. Brotherhood don't even know were collecting for them.
---
Yeah i have a similar amount, but when they scan the servers and they see that X number of players have Y amount stockpiled they come up with a number that is doable. Problem with that is the details.
---
How many people are no longer playing but have large stockpiles of scrap, how many people have amounts similar to ours but are not going to donate it all for worthless rewards etc, how many more people have decent amounts but were planning on redoing a camp, or as the donation has to be of at least 250 you could have ten thousand players with 245 concrete in their stash and can not be bothered to go get more just to give it away. 
---
Are they even scanning by players and amount, or just looking at the amount stored, or the amount possible to be salvaged in a day. If there is 100,000 players each with 200 concrete in the stash, are they interpreting that as 20 million concrete can be donated or are they seeing that as IF 100,000 players all grind concrete, and donate it all, within the next 48 hours, thats 20 million concrete that can be donated.
---
It does not make sense for them to give us a goal we can not accomplish so im just wondering how they came up with the numbers. I suspect they assumed we would all be stockpiling it for the past month, endlessly taking over every workshop and setting up extractors at every concrete resource possible, farming every location over and over...or there is a couple dozen dupers that have gigantic stockpiles over scrap throwing the numbers way off.
---
We're not going to, even if we don't give enough materials we'll mysteriously get enough right at the last minute like magic
---
Ticks are the one I hate especially when you have over 5 of them.
---
i hope one day there'll be a community event for me where all players are supposed to collect a million pieces of COAL to build me a nice statue
---
Not sad.  Bemused.  I don't know how, but Bethesda still manages to surprise me with their incompetence on a daily basis.  I really ought to be used to it by now.
---
Regs has pocketed them, for now. :-/
---
I spawn in the water or under water every time. So many diseases    : (
---
Isn't the presidential office bunker thing there too, that had the cut event and power armour ? I could be wrong !
---
Do you actually think Bethesda was ever going to alter the look of the place depending on how much resources has been pooled? Really?
---
Yeah I don't think I have enough perks at the moment. I've focused on perks such as lead belly, cannibal so I always have food out in the wasteland.
---
Maybe.  But I think it's more likely just another thing they didn't think through.
---
That has been how they do.
---
I don't think I can donate any concrete.  I had 68 when this leg of the event started, and have picked up 100% of the concrete I have seen since then.
---
I now have 76 concrete.  250 is a freakin' pipe dream.
---
Every time I think I've found another girl, it's a dude playing as a girl. You can usually tell because they're all wearing that nuka girl outfit.
---
I have this issue and can't proceed. I put the fuse first, tried other world, did not help
---
Now, place the salvaged assaultron head in a display case and laugh at it for ETERNITY.
---
It might not be the Brotherhood you expect, it could be three outcast in a stolen vertibird with no support behind them. They're still going to act like jerks though.
---
Are the community rewards for EVERYONE do do you have to have actually donated in each stage to get it.
---
Because once I saw the "rare" list I noped out because it's all garbage and Todd has no fucking clue what "rare" actually means.
---
They need to make what's currently there better before adding new ones.
---
It sounds like you need to stream this for the content.
---
I agree.
---
When you find out let me know.  But I'd have to guess they won't come out until the entire event is over.
---
Steel I didn't mind as much but if the Brotherhood want concrete they're going to have to buy it from me.
---
You’ll get there eventually.  I always invest in damage and defensive ability first and worry about quality of life later.  Dead enemies can’t hurt you and many of them have meat or shelf stable food.
---
I’ve had 1st since it came out. Easily donated 20k steel last week with plenty to spare. Last night decided to donate concrete and had 150. I just relocated my camp and built a few foundations but only 150 tells me that I didn’t have a lot to begin with.
---
Not even power armour is safe from them
---
Completed it and killed myself in the process. One of the dumber challenges imo. The other challenges make sense (build camps, survive for x minutes, rank up, etc.). But the storm is one of the things you are explicitly trying to NOT be in. Having to spend time in there is contradictory to how you are supposed to play that mode...
---
There's also a Tinker's Bench in the bathroom that I only just discovered.
---
on pc, got an instigating grognac axe for sale.
---
No “special” rewards!
---
Daily
---
Good points, all of them.
---
After all these years I figured it out the [REDACTED] were made by [REDACTED] for the purpose of [REDACTED] and thus caused the[REDACTED]
---
Vanguard/Bolstering combinations, with weight reduction effects. Big fan of Solar Armor for the insane health regen.
---
Some content you have to earn. 
---
Also so people can’t go around duping it
---
They have bots for that.

* "*For a while I’ve had this idea to build a camp that has two pitchfork shops. One is a big corporation type of hi-tech spotless building that sells ridiculously expensive 1499 caps pitchforks that come with a life style and status quo, the other is a small dirty old shed of a grumpy guy that sells the same pitchforks for 10 caps. Why? Because I think that’s funny and it’s what happens in real life. (Don’t worry, I’ll keep selling all plans I have at 10 caps each somewhere in the back of the build, no matter what. Which reminds me: if all you guys are so against pay-to-win, DLC and such, why the fuck do most of you try to sell stuff at ridiculously high prices? Give what you have to the community already)."*  
---
**Fun idea, very fallout esque**  
---
*  "*But I start my day dehydrated and hungry, so I have to cook and boil food to get through the day. Well, not the day, the next half hour, really. The amount of food and drink the game thinks I need seems to be adjusted to the average intake of the US"*  
---
**Well, there are purifiers that you can build, crops that you can plant, but you do that so what's the big deal? Also cheap shot at the US**  
---
*  *But hey, no worries; I have some carrots and tato’s growing at my camp, I’ll be good once I figure out how much dirty water I’ll need to cook as many boiling water to make as many vegetable soups as I can. Easy.*   
---
**Once you figure that out? How long will that take? just go to a river, spam the collect button, go to your cooking stove and spam boiled water that will be the amount you need.**   
---
*  *Bent over to the stove I notice I can only do a few because I’m out of salt. Salt! So I’ll have to head to a place where I know they have lots of salt first.*   
---
**Then make something that doesn't require salt, if you have tatos and corn you can make stuff without salt. Or just eat the veggies, drink the boiled water and get on with it.**  
---
*  *Map, fast travel, here I g… I’m over encumbered. Now I have to get into my inventory and stash to see where I can lose weight. I have all the perks for carrying and some legendary stuff that reduces weight, but somehow there has never been a day that I’ve not been over encumbered.*   
---
**That's on you, not the game, there is a limit on what you can carry and store and for a good reason. This isn't a sanbox game. If you start your session over encumbered and hungry it´s because you didn't think about those things when logging off last time.** 
---
*  *After getting rid of all the ooh-that’s-nice-maybe-I’ll-keep-it items, I’ve only lost 2 pounds and I need to lose at least 50 more.*   
---
**So you got rid of one to four things?**   
---
*  *Let’s dump all the drugs at the vendor! Oh wait, can’t. The vendor’s out of money. So let’s just dump all the buffout and stimpaks anyway, maybe some poor soul will find them and be happy.*   
---
**I thought you said you just started your session? maybe you were playing the night before too huh. Anyways, dump it all if you can't move. One run with pharma pharma to the hospital in charleston or to morgantown airport will give you all the aid and chems you need.**   
---
*  *Oh shit. The stash is full. Of what exactly I’ll never know, I’ve been keeping it tidy, wrapping everything up in plastic, tossing out everything that is not essential.*    
---
**Clearly you haven't. maybe you want to keep all those things. But in this game you also kind of have to choose what to keep and what not to. You can't have it all. And what do you mean you'll never know? Go through it, run the numbers and see what is taking up so much space.**   
---
*  *I can sort by weight in the inventories, cool. But it’s sorted by weight of each single element. I may have ten tonnes of feathers and it won’t show up.*   
---
**But if you see that uou have 9000 feathers that weigh 0,01 then maybe that´s a clue thaty you have 900 pounds worth of feathers. Look at both the number of items and then multiply the weight. More in depth analysis of your inventory would be a nice quality of life adjustment, not a necessary change.** 
---
*  *I’ll just get rid of some ammo, some of that may weigh quite a bit. I have one of those ammo-exchange thingies, so here goes. Okay, let’s write down which weapons I use at the time and which ammo they use, so I know which I don’t need.*   
---
**If like you have said have all the weight reduction perks, for this "bandoleer" and "batteries included"  you would need more then 200.000 ammo for it to make a dent. I have those perks and have roughly 150.000 ammo on me at all times.**   
---
*  *and junk that doesn’t get scrapped for whatever reason when you click scrap ALL junk.*   
---
**That´s because those items are crafting components for some grenades and stuff , it makes you manually delete them so you don't accidentally do it.**   
---
*  *So there we have all the ores and the other stuff. Heavy! So let’s melt the ores! Oh shit. I need acid to do that, I’m all out. Am I going to do that first, or the salt, or… what else was there?* 
---
*
---
That is 100% why I'm asking for more events.  No one likes NW.  If there were pvp events that were just a fight and none of that hoppin around for candy nonsense it would remove said trash mechanics.  No tag/tag back initiation, no fee.  Just lead sandwiches for everyone.  Feel me?
---
Jesus left this game a long tim-
---
No, wait, he’s still here. Trying to ft back to heaven and keeps getting dumped back to the game screen.
---
&gt; think of other people than yourselves.... *sigh* typical...
---
Or maybe Bethesda should think that people would actually want to use concrete for building or selling?
---
Brotherhood will still come. We just won’t get rewards. This doesn’t impact the story, nor should it. It’s just a community event like the clean up Appalachia last year.
---
I must be in the minority that I don't care whether or not these objectives succeed. 
---
Firstly it's the same problem we already have with a lot of events - the ones who get punished the most are the ones participating to complete the event.
---
Then the rewards are no where near proportional to the effort. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together can see it's not worth your time participating. Those many hours and valuable scrap in a lot of cases for sweet FA completion reward (really, a beret and banner...?) and crappy caches that give you mostly crap that most seasoned players have already gotten.
---
I'm actually surprised we even got over the line with the steel one but it looks like people are catching on that it's just not worth the effort.
---
Because of dupers, that's why.
---
Wandering trader was visiting my camp like every other day, sleeping in my bed also 😒. But they seem to sell good scrap packages which weights 1lb only unpacked, like 30 of each junk (or most of it, excluding rare ingredients).
---
Well let's hope they fall quick, the Enclave demands it.
---
That would be nice!
---
You can still get all that stuff from the settlers and still side with the raiders
---
I got the Ultracite Laser plan last night, was doing something BoS related, it was either Defiance has Fallen or Recruitment Blues that I got it from.
---
Unrealistic goals are...unrealistic. I bet they grant the reward anyway for our time spent in doing it
---
Nope to BOS event. Too much work.
---
Because it involves Obsidian and that gets people's juices flowing. Any chance to make Obsidian look better obviously has to come at the expense of Bethesda because clicks
---
I know, but you have the most npc to talk to if you go with the settlers
---
I'm fairly sure mirelurk kings are the most hated. Specifically the ones that spawn when SBQ dies and wreck all the players that try looting before stashing.
---
You can still talk to them?
---
The problem is that it's not that deterministic. It's mostly trial and error and even then sometimes it's not consistent. 
---
You could have the fast travel point zeroed in exactly where you want it and sometimes you just don't land there for absolutely no reason.
---
Not to the ones that betray you and you have to kill them. Did you read the post before commenting?
---
Ugh, I can't wait to be invited to pay a monthly subscription for unlimited item storage *and* weapon repair...
---
I figured that out indeed but still sucks
---
Ok? I think it’s fine if we fail because the reward doesn’t equal what we need to do. Now if we don’t get that collectron that’s a different story
---
To combat the dupers
---
Could easily be solved with a warning though
---
On mobile click the elipses at the top right corner of the main sub page
---
You make a logical point but this is Bethesda we're talking about. The simplest bit of extra code that makes perfect sense since you can't get more than 20 from the machine anyhow.
---
It's a few lines of code but even that's too much effort for Bethesda.
---
Enforce perk (rank 1 is enough) + shotgun + aim to legs to cripple + aim to head to disable laser = helpless sexy robot laying on the ground and you can do whatever you want 👌
---
All I know is you can trade for it
---
No event in the world is going to change the fact that guns felt better to shoot on N64 than they do on any Fallout game. That's the trash mechanic. I do think a new version of survival mode without legendaries would be good for you sadists who want to play PVP with Bethesda's shitty gun mechanics, but me, if I want PVP I'll go play the tons of other games I own that actually do guns right.
---
That’s why i do it too
---
Because they wanted us to earn it, instead of just buying them off other players. Imagine how few players would do the Pioneer Scout challenges if they could just buy backpacks from player vendors instead.
---
How many concrete?! Yea right, like we ever gonna get that much. I’m wondering if we even got all that steel we needed... Didn’t see anything regarding the BOS head, so I guess not 😂
---
Across 20 characters, I have about 36k concrete. I have about 44k cork.
---
The BoS won't get a single, measly scrap until they learn what a proper fucking reward for my time and effort is.
---
Bethesda only hotfixes things that directly impact their revenue. 
---
It's a very simple equation. Since not having a deep pocketed mod for SS (despite saying they added it in the patch notes) won't drop the player count and people are stopping their Fallout 1st sub because of the issue, it's just not a priority for Bethesda.
---
I don't expect this to be fixed until the next patch, in a month or so from now.
---
If he isn’t giving a daily, scrap and replace his bar
---
How do you get the liberator friend?
---
I believe it’s a decision by the developers to stretch out the grind and improve the longevity of the game. The players hate it but the game company makes more money in the long run.
---
You’re misunderstanding my point. I don’t need new events, I need more available at a given time. 
---
Overhauling the existing ones is the way to go.
---
Ok so you personally earn it. 
---
You get the treasury notes, turn them in for bullion, then get the notes to learn the piece.
---
Then you farm scrip to get modules and junk to build these items.
---
In the end lets say you make 10 SS chest pieces.
---
You get 2 Exterminator, 2 nocturnal, 3 troubleshooter, 1 mutant, 1 vanguard AP and 1 Bolstering environment.
---
So you figure you can use the bolstering out of the batch cause you are bloodied and could possibly trade the vanguard if it was allowed for the unyielding piece you are actually seeking.
---
But now you only have 2 options, scrip them like the other garbage you get, or keep it in your inventory taking up stash space, cause you cannot even pass it to yourself on a mule...
---
Dupers have already duped them, I see low lvls 50-60 with full SS armor flying around all the time, no one will convince me that all of them have played enough and farmed enough bullion and scrip/modules.
---
Idk maybe not letting us trade them but at least being able to pass them through a terminal to another one or our characters stash??
---
Yeah. I was somewhere around level 50 when this started and I'd been fording concrete I'd stumbled across for future camp building.
---
I had ~265 units and after making the donation I got the typical rewards of alcohol and floater grenades. 
---
Like someone said earlier, since I'm not using an alcoholic build and rewards are more like penalties.
---
Assuming I don't get over-encumbered, I have to carry them to a shop for a real reward, and that I've probably already maxed out the shops!!! lol
---
The page is here - [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
It's only updated once a day.
---
Related: the damn invisible Assaultron Dominatrix (wordplay intended). I was so thankful when I was able to become a friendly to the Watogan 'bots, so I didn't get annihilated while searching for Marine armour plans.
---
Ants and high grass, if you are fighting something else you will never notice the little ankle biters.
---
let's hope for a legendary 'fix it good' card so the game can be fixed
---
Don't even care in the slightest. The double score and perveyor discounts would suck more to miss but even missing those aren't the end of the world.
---
Unless you're going hardcore into a BoS outpost camp build, you're not going to miss the banner at all in a couple of weeks. We'll probably get something equivalent or better when the main BoS DLC drops, either in game or from the Atomic Shop.
---
The brotherhood are not coming. The guy at Atlas is faking the transmission and collecting all of our junk so he can bulk it and sell it back to us.
---
Concrete is rare scrap since when?
---
I would be in favor of a shared stash between characters....and I never said this prevents duping, but that BGS did it as a result of duping,
---
You can trade the backpack mod plans...
---
Well, at least we'll know for sure that Bethesda isn't fudging the numbers on these community events, and we can actually fail them.
---
Scorchbeasts when they spam their sonic attack. Can't see shit.
---
Those level 50 and 60s may be casual players who are happy enough having the damaged protection and don’t focus on having a matching set of legendary effects.
---
Damn. Same here, we should form a club or something
---
Refusing to spare 10 out of 800lb because its too much.  I bet if you found a new weapons or armour you would find a way to haul it back to camp. Merely confirming what I said - players use any excuse not to get involved.
---
If we could all trade SS pieces, wouldnt there be more demand for atom shop skins that actually bring money? 
---
I dont see how just the act of playing the game brings them money
---
I think the only thing that would make sense is the ability to somehow sell to someone who has already learned the plan. I like that some things you have to earn.
---
Just had generally worse fps drops and had it reoccurring more than usual. Haven’t crashed once since the new patch.
---
Not the actual backpack...
---
Ya lag city even on pc. Ive found as long as I didn't look down it didn't slow down nearly as much. Until its time to loot.
---
No actually it doesnt
---
We live in a post facts era. People don't care if what you're saying is factual or not. All they care about is whether or not it agrees with them.
---
Yeah, I know some stuff about Yao guais
---
*Cement* 
---
I see what you did there.
---
How is having a full set mean they are duper’s. Could easily be a second character that is fed a stash of junk legendaries to scrip. Junk isn’t really a limit. Getting access to the vault can be done way before lvl 50. Grinding gold is the only limiting thing and you could definitely grind enough from when you got access to treasury notes til lvl 50.
---
The bullion cap will be automatic removed if they an event drop
---
Settlers and raiders didn't need any help when they arrived. BoS want to enslave us.
---
Why not?  Everquest 2 did it in the cities as the main way to house players.  A free low rent one then more expensive ones as you moved into better parts of the main citiy.  15 years ago?  Customizable interiors. Hell people had businesses decorating the damned things - glitchy building.
---
At least he now correctly stays at his desk, although to keep the balance Samuel now wanders around more. Of course he has to stay there now it takes multiple attempts to get through the dialogue - skip...leave...wait...leave...wait...
---
Same, i gave up like 750 steel to see what we were rewarded, and was not happy. And the end reward is not worth grinding for imo. This event is a complete waste of time
---
Glad to see that someone in Bethesda is doing good work.
---
It's a small thing but it sometimes it makes all the difference.
---
I would be cool with that... just like the pioneer backpack 
---
Give the pieces you can make some sort of value even if it is for those who know the plan
---
O agree they are really annoying for stealth especially in my opinion. you encounter them, use escape artist to be hidden and they just stay underground or pop up underneath you even though you are hidden
---
Ok so how about allowing us to trade them with people who know the plan?
---
Thats good to know thanks
---
That's always been their M.O.
---
Boy, it really is low for concrete, isn't it?
---
The rewards are not compelling and the materials are harder to come by.
---
Also the BoS can die in a nuclear fire.
---
Legendary weapons are in every MMO, they need to balance the weapons is what they need to do. I think they are silently killing PVP with in adventure mode, and when it does get the full nerf I wouldnt be surprised thats when we get the nuclear winter map in the mire thats been data mined and also wouldnt be surprised if this all happens when one wasteland drops.
---
With their backbreaking flip that stuns you.
---
Same on PS4 ...completely unplayable due to low framerate
---
I'd put in the work and give up all my materials if the rewards where worth it, as it is it's a waste of time.
---
These numbers are most like based on the amount everyone already have. A lot of people do actually have insane amounts of concrete and cork due to how long they had Fallout 1st.
---
In fact, I'd argue the numbers are so high because of how many people have loads in there scrap box. Most player just refuse to donate their stuff for a community reward, preferring something they could get have that not everyone has.
---
I just wish there was no red at all.
---
It’s mixed bag for me.  I’ve had multiple outstanding experiences on a server (I often just run around tagging as much as possible with my sword, lol), and then on some servers just a bunch of assholes one shotting everything including legendaries.   
---
As soon as the assholes show up, switch servers.   I was in a group yesterday for hours, everyone was cool, had a blast.
---
They will auto complete it to not look like idiots
---
Jetpack and all? Lots of low lvls? I dont see it sorry, some maybe, most got it through glitching or duping, thats kist my opinion
---

**You are angry that there is stuff to do? That you have to work for things?Also for the future, don't mine ore unless you have the acid for it. That way you wont have this mess.** 
---
**Conclusion:**   
---
I understand your frustrations to a certain degree. But this isn't a complete sandbox game (although to a certain extent). It is a survival post apocalyptic game. I personally don't think this game is hard enough. And needs to work on their mechanics more.
---
You know, maybe you're right in THAT aspect. But why is it my fault the game is broken? I'm the CONSUMER and NOT the person trying to sell a broken game.
---
BoS operating manual is pretty much to show up to a new area, "secure" all of the resources from the locals by promising to use their advanced technology to improve life in the area, declare that the locals are actually raiders when everyone is not being compliant or complaining about things like "if you take all of our food we will die", and then kill all the raider scum and talk about how the American dream was a misguided lie.
---
Do you check the requests? 
---
Most people who ask for trades are just looking through your inventory to see what you got and such
---
In some cases, they are just looking at your gear.
---
In other cases, they are seeing if they can PvP you.
---
I bet people will miraculously ignore the poor rewards to find cloth for the collectron, or Cork for the extra dailies, or...
---
They didn't see anything they wanted. And we're giving you a chance to look threw their stuff. If neither of you requested anything then nothing happened
---
We should at least be able to trade with those who’ve learned the same weapon and armor plans
---
Aigth thank you!
---
Literally ANYONE could've made this mistake. But cuz I did. And i posted about it. I'm at fault? HAHAHAHA REDDIT GO POST
---
I donated steel once and haven't donated anything else since. The in game rewards for donating aren't very good, and the atom shop rewards aren't very good either. There's no real incentive for me to participate. Also it costs me like 35 to travel there everytime. It's a no from me
---
Bethesda and logical self-reflection? Do you need me to call you an ambulance?
---
Ah this is just perfect. Good job. I wish had the creativity in game to make bases like this
---
Sorry, i just cant believe somebody would grind all those modules and bullion just to go around with an exterminator, nocturnal, regenerating, mutant, troubleshooter set...
---
And in others they are showing off their gear in hopes you request it
---
Thats what I’m saying, some sort of value to the pieces we build beyond scrip
---
My best sellers in this order:
---
Unyielding, Bolstering, Chameleon, Regenerating, Vanguard
---
I always buy that ammo bundle when i see it. Great price. That wandering trader doesn't have apparel though
---
Oh yeah, forgot about that one.
---
How can I make an offer on something?
---
If I see something I want, all I can do is request it. Do they have to come up with a price?
---
Yea, I'm always looking through my stuff, never gets reauested.
---
Just seems like a long time to be looking through stuff you don't want.
---
Ammo at 1 cap, dump missiles and mininukes in bag nearby now.  It flies outta there
---
Maybe they haven't even made a BoS DLC so they made the event impossible and discouraged players from participating on purpose.
---
10lb out of 800 for 1 out of multiple resources that you need for BASIC FEATURES of the game. Not everyone can stock up and have SPARE resources to donate. Keep defending Bethesda and their ridiculous ideas though, they might give you a cookie one day.
---
FO has always had collectibles, if that means I have to use my stash space in this game to collect? Yes, I will.. That's what FO is about in my opinion, exploring and finding fun collectibles.. Not a job that I need to do when I am playing games for fun.
---
Like I said, keep defending their unreasonable goals thinking anyone but FO1st has the storage to stock up on resources.
---
I hope it fails, even if it is to simply prove that Bethesda is not in touch with their community. Let alone maybe one day, they'll increase storage space so more people can stock up for a similar event, not just people that have FO1st.
---
I'm not rewarding Bethesda for being lazy by paying them monthly or even yearly.
---
It’s 6250 gold for the whole set of plans (arms, legs, chest, jet pack). That is 23 days worth of gold bullion at 200 a day from treasury notes and 600 a week from smiley. How is that limiting?
---
Legendary modules sure are not limiting. I have a mile full of junk legendaries to scrip. They could too. Just move them over to the right character and instant 100+ modules. On top of that SS junk becomes more modules.
---
I literally dont even care how toxic this sounds. It is a bug. It shouldn't even be an option if it wasn't meant to be painted. Just like if I place something underneath a chain link/wire/whatever floor. The item shoots up to the top. Just like how now I cant even switch from doors to walls thought a quick swap. This game is broken 3 more times everytime they 'fix' it.
---
I don't count that lol
---
Because dataminers can see them in the files, along with all of the other requested mods, but BGS hasn’t enabled them.
---
Wood for the outfit, these are all the rewards I'm interested in  (including yours), for the rest of them I'm not interested
---
Since it doesn't drop from enemies, is rarely found around the map, and in general there is a lack of need for it and thus not many people stockpile from it, unlike screws or lead.
---
The collectron is dependent on cloth. While its a resource thats reasonably plentiful, its also a resource that those who craft a lot of ammo and make their own gunpowder is not going to want to part with. Throw into the mix the likely loss of interest in the whole thing by then if more fail (cork will if concrete does) then Im not feeling too hopeful. Ive started making an even bigger effort for cloth hoarding.
---
As of right now were at 4.65M of 150M   
---
So I kinda hope we fail so that they devs are like what, how?  If we fail by a bunch maybe they'll realize an iota of how much they are out of touch in their game.  We all know they don't play it.  
---
Ya I tried to contribute and it took me an hour to go around the map and get 250 concrete to turn in and after the 1 i was like I'm done.  These rewards are not worth it.
---
I don’t know, as I never pick them up.  They are creepy af to me, I shoot at them and or knock them over.  Mannequins too.
---
Have the donor provisions alternate the caps from scrip to gold bullion (250 caps, 25 scrip or bullion). That would be a good incentive to get higher level players to donate scarp.
---
Yeah the price is all in them. If you think what they priced it at is to high you can turn it down and tell then its to high
---
All the events should be worth 20 score and Dailes 10, incentivize people doing them.
---
Bethesda will finish it themselves then talk about grossly overestimating the amount of concrete players had, etc etc
---
They do, then you can decline with a reason, such as "I don't have the caps", "price too high", "price too low", "don't want this" "more of this" etc
---
Win or fail the event isn't going to change anything besides the rewards gated behind each mat donation, the BoS are tied to season 2 so they're going to come anyway whatever we do.
---
Mole rats for sneaky builds, instant detect and teleport to give you “You have now contracted Rad Worms”.
---
Like the prison guard patrol...
---
The Pokémon team rigged the numbers so that everyone would get the shiny monkey, it’s not uncommon for online games to do that, they just want the community to play an active role
---
You and I probably wouldn’t. But again a more casual player isn’t going to just know that unyielding is what you should be rolling for. We have a value that we put on those troubleshooters, nocturnal, and exterminator pieces. For us they are kinda useless, but a casual player might see extra damage against robots as a good effect. They may not get how having extra stat points from unyielding is so useful either. I’m sure there’s people with duped sets. But I think it’s less then you think, or at least hope with the secret service armor.
---
"Infinite concrete" and "100% true and factual" doesn't go together...
---
Rare might be overstating it. But it is heavy, meaning you may need to go out farming specifically for that one thing, whereas normally you can hoover up lots of different stuff. It’s also not really used in anything apart from building. What most people do is move camp *then* go out looking for some, as it’s just clogging up valuable stash space otherwise.
---
No, you're just hearing things
---
Just adding another comment to state that I’m on Xbox as well and been having zero problems with radiation rumble. Ran it 4 times yesterday and seemed to be just fine other than the usual group of people not grabbing ore but still letting scavengers die somehow. I wonder why some people are having issues and others not. Legendary run board is low FPS for me, but everything in game seems to be just as buggy and fidgety as before the patch.
---
Buy bulk concrete from railway stations.
---
Fog Crawlers. Oh how I hate those staggering, armored b*stards. They make melee really hard.
---
Idk the math, but I would think farming enough events for 23 days to get all those treasury notes would put you well over lvl 56... but I havent done the math in XP...
---
ConCork you mean.
---
Seems counterintuitive to not even have the option of making an offer.
---
So funny to read OP’s post - my wife loved that scoped .44 you get early in game, too! 
---
I was waaay up in levels when she started playing, so I started a new character while keeping my “high level dude”, so that we would be on the same page.  I didn’t want the uglies we came up against to be too high level for her to take on while braving the wasteland with me.  Kinda humbling to not have marsupial mutation nor jet pack, but we have a blast playing together!  She loves changing outfits all the time, exploring  and building her camp.  It was refreshing to see her get all excited whenever we discovered something new to her.  I caught her checking out Beckett’s ass, and I still give her hell about that any time he pops up lol!
---
I dunno man. Maybe you need the "CAUTION: Beverage is hot" warning on your coffee too.
---
I literally cant wrap my head around why you would look at a rare drop unique power armor helmet and decide thats the one you are going to test skins on.
---
The game has many problems, failings and oversights but honestly there is only so much they can do to protect players from their own poor decisions
---
I had fallout first for 4 months and I have 1k concrete in my scrap box. No, the BOS cannot have it. I might need that. Bethesda screwed up.
---
Brotherhood will just take materials from raiders or settlers when they get here if we don't get it for them.
---
Im sure we will continue with the event like nothing is wrong.
---
Afternoon
---
this ^^^
---
people are downvoting this comment  because they don't like the truth
---
There's a lot of things wrong with the trading system in this game
---
I paid for the steel bungalow package (£12). It was a pain to place before the update but now I literally cannot place it on ANY foundation. It says "intersects with object" or "floating object". I literally cannot use it anymore. I spent 2 hours trying to find a place to put it. Absolutely awful.
---
Because the Brotherhood of Concrete are coming
---
It’s because you’re actually in a small room ithe fourth floor with a memory/vr gizmo ( on loan from goodneighbor)  strapped to your face. And you ran into the coffee table.
---
Laser weapons don't have specific perks, rather the weapon type (pistol, semi-automatic rifle, automatic rifle, and heavy) determines which perk cards to use. =
---
You know anyone who has any
---
Why didn't they just make it so each player has a set amount of materials they need to donate to get the rewards.
---
Nope but you can look around trading subreddits but they pop up for trade here and there
---
I thought they had this previously right?
---
50 cal
---
I am convinced the marketing peeps do not play the game, and there is no gamemaster involved in most of the decisioning.    Sad.
---
I think you nailed it here. If the concern were solely duping, we should still at least be able to share the items across our characters.   
---
I have a junkies FFRFR gauss minigun that I am never going to use (that character is bloodied and rolled a Bloodied FFR). So I put it up on display because I like how it looks, but it will never get used unless they nerf bloodied builds(makes me sad tbh)
---
lol thx. But it actually it isnt accurate because ShoopDaWhoop never charges dem lazors and fires right away!
---
They should have included a 1st time donation unique award similar to the Stein at Fasnacht. Perhaps then the haters would have shown at least a modicum of interest.
---
Here are 2 of them. What you can’t see is the announcers table, entrance screen, the smoke machines, the interviewers table, the rows of fans on the other side of the ring, and the pipboy cutouts with mounted animals for faces. The ring looks like it’s 4 foundation pieces with blue flooring, columns for ring posts, Santa as Dusty, and power wires for the ropes. The lights spinning around the Dusty Rhodes was a nice touch too.  
---
I only took two with my phone. Have a few more saves as screenshots.

---
Yes, a good chuckle! Thank you for sharing and please remember how incredibly lucky you are to have your partner enjoy the game (any game). The rest of us have to suffer with "Are you playing that stupid game again?"
---
Might have to steal your idea. Also think the caption cosmos outfits would make great cheesey leotards
---
Ward is Todd
---
Yeah I donated 1k concrete, I’m trying to donate at least 1k of every material but i donated 10k steel lol
---
I would donate a lot of cork and concrete for better plans. I dont need this banner nor high score weekend. My only interest is rare plans/outfits and maybe 50% off sale if they include legendary modules.
---
I'd never seen a fixer before update I've had 5 drop all useless but still least least there dropping had multiple groc axes and ten mill but I play a stupid amount.
---
Mine is in the Enclave uniform with patrolman sunglasses - it's a look she wears really, really well...
---
Produces one concrete per 3-5 minutes. Yeah, it’s pretty lackluster and slow. Not worth wasting material to even build the resource excavator
---
For no good reason? Like the game is in tip-top shape and nothing wrong with it? You sure?
---
**YOU SIR ARE A LEGEND, THANKS A LOT**
---
The title is annoying
---
You better be a melee build with a deathclaw and a bear costume, pulling that right off. Topkek.
---
Railway vendors
---
I downloaded a mod that replaced meat piles with duffel bags, no lag now
---
Going by what I've seen, this whole idea doesn't work. The numbers being so high indicate they expected everyone to join and donate their supplies they already had and reward everyone for it.
---
However from what I have witnessed, people would actually be happier if the hat and flag were a rare plan in these create instead. Also the idea everyone would join in is stupid (even if it wasn't out of the way and everything else you mentioned). All the past big events has had people decide they don't want to do it. Asking people now to donate their stuff in a community event which only a small amount of people will bother with to begin with has only made less people willing to do so. Never till now have anything claim cork or concrete is rare till you asked them to give it away xD
---
Fallout 76 is an unoptimized mess. I have also issues on PC. It's the only game that drops under 40fps.
---
What did you change too?
---
same here I'll donate one lot for concrete and cork
---
I absolutely agree that the majority of content in the game can be enjoyed with a META build.
---
I have a friend who is up in the mid 100's with most of his characters but struggles a little bit. I asked him about his build one day and he was telling me he was doing really well after getting his SS armour as it got him to the highest armour he's ever had at 250 and he was doing 59 damage with his plasma gun.
---
I tried to explain to him that he was a bit behind the curve and that was why he had some problems with the bigger enemies but he's happy with his build so...
---
As long as you can enjoy the game playing with what you have that's all that matters. We just have to hope that the devs don't try to make the game to shoehorn players into a few of the meta builds.
---
This reminds me of my husband and me. I'm the one trying to run away while he holds his ground and takes things out.
---
Sheepsquatch scare the shit out of me. Not sure I will ever be brave enough to take one on
---
No. And yes.
---
Long story short. They where temporarily avalible after an update bugged something out. So unless someone is selling one you won't ever find them as they are a legacy item.
---
You can get them as a modded weapon but even than you have to actually find someone selling it.
---
“Mass-downvoted for a 100% true and factual statement.” - what, that you’re a condescending ass? How can you mass downvote as one person? 🤔 Obviously this tells me your IQ. 
---
Yeah that parts true lol. You are throwing all logic out the back dude, concrete and cork are one of the rarest materials out there. Sure, spend 3 hours running around trying to find concrete, you’d get 5-6x the amount of steel compared to concrete in that amount of time. There’s a reason why concrete is rare, it’s barely used in any crafting or building.
---
if you are not PVP person what would you use the sentinels slot for?
---
I ve already droped 300 stimpacks and 400 radaways.. selling booze was enough to cover some part of 1400caps. Of course we will refuse to donate especially when almost every 1st member could have done this legendary run a week ago.
---
Collect garbage to give to some people that are coming to make you collect more stuff for them.
---
No you’re right. The game crashing every minute is way better.
---
Try running your camera over one before you pick it up
---
BoS isnt even aware we're doing this. Russel is asking us so that they have a place ready when they show up. bet you anything when they get here, the BoS wont even thank him cuz they never asked for anything anyway.
---
 Not bad for sure. Especially +1S and swing speed.
---
People prolly dont want it only because the multi purpose axe is kinda weak, compared to the other melee weapons.
---
Also , vampires is generally a good star to have.
---
Dude,what are you so salty about? If they were on your team, then you'll get the loot.
---
This really should have been in the patch notes, what more secret good things did they do that might have placated the masses if only they told us?
---
Sitting on 1151 gold tickets refuse to buy gold off smiley and just buying each item when I can afford it. And haven't even started worth with the rng waiting for the deep pockets mods
---
So close
---
Use VATS &amp; shoot their leg. Once they are down they are easy. I used to be absolutely terrified of them
---
Might help if I got my own tag right -  UCGSQUAWK
---
I'll have a look for you tonight, thanks.
---
Added 2 more 3\* shovels, 1 pick, 1 pipe wrench, 1 pool cue and my favourite - a 3\* rolling pin, to my collection over the weekend. I hate mama murgh.
---
Yes, let me go buy 17 things of bulk concrete just to get 1 turn in... not happening
---
Why don’t they just come out with that welcome mat that workshops have? Problem solved. Unless it’s be the load in and rendering problem that’d interfere with it.
---
I found a 3* legendary scortchbeast yesterday. I was in my melee build, and I waited for it to land while plinking it with a handmade. 
---
I got all the way through it's main HP bar, and part way through the second, used 400 bullets or more and too many stimpacks and  the motherfucker did not land. Eventually I realized that I didn't have enough bullets, and after 25 minutes or so, he wasn't going to land, and gave up. Fuck Scortchbeasts.
---
I think they had a welcome mat in the atomic shop but it wasn't a ft target.
---
They did in Fo4, but FO4 was a single player rpg. Strangely, they have this in workshops but not CAMPS.
---
I know :D, I so want to be wrong because I want that banner sign but we haven't got a snowball's chance in a Swedish Sauna
---
Why? Caps are piss easy to get. I literally depleted the vendor caps and refilled them part way by selling shit and buying bulk concrete.  And I'm still at 29k caps.
---
I do the same to the damn creepy monkeys with cymbal's
---
The haters hate it, because the demanded donation are in no relation to the "rewards". Everybody is better off selling the scrap directly to the vendors and buying the highly common plans directly. That way we even get to make a few caps.
---
I hate that it's on a big ol tire though, really limits placement...
---
...damn...now I want a horseshoe hand grenade...not all that strong but a bigger radius so when you throw it you just have to be kinda close.
---
I was going to do 1 donation of each, figured no problem, I've had first from day 1. I do not have enough concrete or cork for even 1 donation. Thats right, after a year of collecting randomly, I do not have 250.
---
Nice tip. I will do this next time!
---
do the settler quest that gets you a chinese stealth suit. you yourself dont get the reprogramed liberator, it just wanders around the interior of Foundation.
---
it is cute tho. they drew a smiley face on it.
---
I love how everyone here except maybe one person is jumping in just to argue with you but I'm seeing you dismantle the argument every single time and lay a fat shit on their chest.
---
If they're already fighting, they'll also get the scrip.  If they engage the pack by not shooting the leader first, well, I dont know what to say.  Also, I've run that event prob 100 times and never encountered someone mid-struggle with the puppers.
---
This game is a disappointment in terms of implementation. Other wise it is a great game
---
No I'm almost 100% sure it was just hit chance overall
---
*tinfoil hat on* Or maybe they want to start selling concrete in the atom shop and use this event as an excuse to do so ...
---
First come, first serve... always will be in open events... oneshotting does not distinguish between high/low lvl...
---
Nice namedropping btw...
---
acting like dupers dont exist
---
It's a rare resource, and a lame camp item honestly, bad combination  
---
I don't know anyone that I play with that cares about this item at all, they did want the hat and the upcoming collectron tho
---
Feel I should correct that, wasn't the update on fallout. Just a coincidence that I need to clear my Xbox cache after the update, didn't realize till trying a few other games
---
Yeah, consoles are fucked.
---
PCs can install a mod and change the meat pile. This reduces the lag because there are no more flies.
---
as expected. except for steel, the numbers are just ridiculous
---
\[doubt\]
---
line in the sand
---
I like awol, irrational fear, riding shotgun too

No more lag or overlooked meat piles.

No more lag or overlooked meat pile

I mean rather ap regen. Looks like no effect or very similar to sugar
---
bro tefuq is ur issue bitch, i saved that low lvl from being slaughtered by wolves and u bitchin about last hit, how about u be happy i didnt loot ur lootbag noob
---
But if we have a club we wouldn't lone
---
Always has been.
---
I donated 250 just to say I participated.   I have thousands and thousands more but I'll be dammed if I waste my materials on stupid gift boxes where I already have all of the "rare" plans.
---
 I guarantee you I'm not the only veteran in the same boat.
---
I found a way to fix it on PC. 
---
Did exactly this steps and it worked:
---
1. Exit the game restart it and join adventure mode.
---
2. As soon as spawned hurry up, enter the AVR Medical Center
---
3. Make your way to the lab and immediately FIRST access the terminal and straight analyze the blood sample without reading anything else.
---
4. THEN put in the T-Fuse
---
I was looking at sources and I have no idea how they expect people to raise the resources needed
---
Played around with it on the weekend...couldn't see any differences.
---
Now, the base damage is 2...so it's possible that I just didn't build enough cards in there to notice the difference, but honestly even a 50% bump is just 1 point of damage and I couldn't see that with any of the cards so I suspect it may not be affected by any cards.
---
I also noticed that it wasn't staggering anyone. I tried it on some low-mid level scorched and one of them was clubbing me with his gun while I was tearing into him with the chainsaw. I wouldn't want to try it on any higher level enemies as I think they'd rip me to shreds.
---
BTW - Low bar and fire looks just so awesome...they really need to make this weapon work.
---
Agreed there, something wall mounted would have been nice.
---
Go out and do something in real life, spend a week or two using your free time to do an interesting activity instead of video games. Or you could play a different game for a while.
---
I played for like 300 hours on Ps4 before I started getting this bug. Now at 500 hours and it feels like it's getting worse. 
---
Worst was 14 attempts before I  gave up and just traveled to a nearby location...
---
High level players are pretty much guaranteed to 1shot a lvl 10 wolf. 
---
My main when using his sidearm 10mm will 1 shot a wolf if sneaking 2 shot otherwise. The critters are just too low level.
---
You're wrong.
---
Do you have *concrete* evidences about that?
---
Wall mounted or just the pole on a much smaller plinth so it can be backed against a wall and be out in the open.
---
Maybe because most of us don't want PvP polluting our traditionally PvE Fallout? If we wanted PvP, there's CoD, Modern Warfare, Fortnite, and a dozen others all the way to WoW Battlegrounds and Arenas.
---
I had 92k of steel from always using scrapper when breaking down weapons. I only ever had 2500 concrete. I can’t imagine there’s really that much concrete in players possession. I have a bunch of plastic and cloth already for those rewards. I finished the legendary run so I only would need the cosmetic rewards, but I’ll keep helping everyone else as long as I have the resources to throw away.
---
Ward is BOS Fanboys. All promises no rewards.
---
The team is trying to hit fix the coronavirus.
---
Well covid and I just came out of the hospital so I’m pretty much stuck inside, I’m just struggling to find any other game to play atm too even if 76 is boring AF right now
---
abandoned or nuked
---
I think the problem is the daily is to kill 3 legendaries and that event is the best opportunity for the low level player to complete the daily challenge. If a low level is around you should at least let them tag the enemy first.
---
I want a flair for shooting the monkey's
---
My wife and I both had covid so during our two week staycation we decided to start playing 76. Of course I heard about all the issues and was apprehensive. We played together the entire time and are both hooked. I ended up siding with the raiders before doing any settler side quests and knowing that they gave stealth armor. She did her research. So now she struts around showing off her Chinese stealth armor while I melt everything with my gauss minigun.  Either way I couldn’t ask for a better partner in the wasteland... even though she steals from my scrap bot and takes all my purified water. Lol
---
Doesn't always work, the game always prioritises where you first placed the camp box, not where it currently is!
---
That’s one (of two) reasons I put atom shop skins on my gear, stops them from seeing what I have.
---
When that happens I give up and extend my base into the new space Bethesda has gifted me!
---
My damn power has been out for three days, just came back on last night. I could imagine that after last week a lot of the east coast midatlantic players aren’t joining in. Not sure if that matters, or if people just don’t want the banner but I’m gonna hop on today and dump what I’ve got
---
The problem is bases load on after you fast travel, so if its ontop of a building, you will fall through the phantom building, that will then spawn over you!
---
How fancy is your base? My endgame is making elaborate themed bases in unusual locations that people don't expect others to even be able to build 
---
For example right near West Tek's entrance there's a huge satellite dish you can actually put your camp inside lol
---
Like living in a bowl
---
I bought BL3 last fall and played it until the Halloween event started on FO76. I recently downloaded the 3 new DLC's and they are a lot of fun.
---
I'm with you, just waiting for new stuff to do and really only log on to check out the atom shop and buy bullion each week.
---
Well being that a single piece of each slayer type does more for you than a complete set of Vanguard/Bolstering......
---
I hear you.i was just hoping that is wasnt a very good gun but none the less it vanished and that sucks.hope it's the last time that happens
---
Ouch :(
---
Yeah it was good, I renamed it big iron for the meme, man ill miss it
---
Should be common enough since people can just make them. What is your platform?
---
You can acquire T-60 plans from doing brotherhood events. Releasing plans for players who have hoarded junk would undermine all the effort of those players who grinded for T-60 armour and mod plans.
---
Actual real-world technology that was considered...thankfully rejected.
---
Called Project Orion as I recall...studied it in my physics program in uni.
---
Er... That one is the rarest outfit probably. It is worth at least max caps. Maybe more ;-)
---
Can't agree more!
---
Yeah pretty valid point. Don’t see a workaround for that, so no chance of it being a thing. Sadly...
---
Ehhhhh that's really more NCR policy tbh
---
BoS  would just barely contact the civilians unless they really needed something like food or water, and even then would preform odd jobs for them
---
They aren't really the territory claiming type, they keep to their outposts, which are usually already established pre war military outposts
---
Who needs to craft gunpowder? Gunpowder is everywhere and drops from almost every enemy! I always have tens of thousands of it with out ever needing to craft it!
---
My first uranium fever run was like that, a high level player was kiting the legendaries and everyone popped into the room to get a shot. I love when everyone is able to work together without communication!
---
Do you play on public or private server?
---
I go in with the sledgehammer flailing as always.
---
The steps above are what I did for that issue. Jump to a need world. Use the computer first and then install the fuse.
---
Maybe I should rethink my generosity. lol
---
Well I am sure I have a quad explosive 44 or a bloodied explosive 44 if your on xbox I can pass one on to you.i put one in my vendor so i know i have at least one to pass on.they both kick ass for sidearms
---
Not that this isn't already happening, is many camps I spawn in under their foundations, sometimes they know it happens and have a chair ontop to rescue visitors!
---
It's is a bit corky
---
Ha ha. For sure. Most outfits weigh 0.1 though. I believe underarmor is 1.1
---
It's really hard to put into words how effing stupid Bethesda's decision makers have to be to continually make such horrible decisions.  They DO NOT play their own game.
---
You could say that about people buying the plans though. 
---
I've been grinding those events and I don't care how I get the plans long as I have a way to get them I don't need another T60 servo plan I need helmet etc. And im sure others are the same. The point I was making is there is no incentive for me as a high level player who only needs T60 plans a reason to grind the event.
---
I have no idea why this hasn't been implemented already, as I can totally see alot more atom shop purchases of outfits just to display.
---
I’m glad someone brought this up. I build. A lot. So on only one character whose home hasn’t moved since day one I had enough concrete for a single box. I might be able to swing a 1000 cork from all five but beyond that this is nuts. This is an impossible task for a legit players who play to build things or the PVP/PVEers who don’t collect scrap. 200 million of the third most popular build material and the hardest for some to get was insane. What broken analytics did the devs look at and say “Wow, a lot of people use concrete so they must get it constantly! Make it 200!”
---
The other one being so you don't scrap or scrip?
---
That's nice of you but I'm on ps4 and while I'm new so I have no clue how to upload a image, I just traded in some script and got a, two shot explosive western revolver with +1 agility, guess Todd smiled down on me and blessed me
---
The problem is camps only load in after fast travelling to them, so you'll just fall though the floor, then it'll load around you!
---
I understand how you feel, specially on public servers, didn't see my first frame until lvl 30ish and didn't get a completed set (T- 45) until about 36ish. 
---
Where have been the most popular areas you have tried to find some? What lvl are you?
---
I donated 1000 concrete. I had 1200. About 400 of that is from specifically looking for concrete while I played over the past week.
---
Lots craft their own because gunpowder actually weighs a crapload and as a misc item, wont go in the scrapbox for FO1st players. I stopped picking it up when I realised how much of my stash budget was consumed by my stash of gunpowder
---
&gt;I cannot stand these bloody things!!! They are so frikken hard to kill
---
*laughs in melee build*
---
That's the point you craft it into bullets!
---
I feel like steel is an easy enough resource that a lot of us probably donated a few thousand steel, checked the rewards for that and decided the other challenges werent worth the "rewards". 
---
Thank you for giving me a variety of hand grenades that I have no interest in using, and can not trade or sell.
---
The cool thing is if she continues playing for a bit and really gets comfortable with WASD movement and shooting, it opens up a whole world of games that she will be able to play and enjoy. The skills she's learning can drive endless hours of fun in the future. 
---
Good luck and have fun!
---
The steel, plastic, and cloth donations I have more then enough to donate 10k or more. The other stuff I can make 2 or 3 donations.
---
And several by the small playground to the north.
---
it just works
---
I share your pain.  Apologists don't care for facts.
---
Sadly no. The legendary do range from 1\* to 3\* though.
---
We definitely needed another post about this.
---
How much caps do you have to redeem though to have a shot at a Dragon? 5000 caps?
---
The only really good place to farm concrete is Bog Town &amp; it's only going to go to one player per server - I spent like 4 or 5 hours running the extractors and ended up with about 700, the expectations for this are insane.
---
i acctually think a large group of casual players, aren't as invested as us here on this reddit and on Discord.  They play when they can and don't really have a build.
---
I built my set a few months ago. Love it and the jetpack.
---
I went for a DR and ap refresh set with qol perks.  It has such good stats you don't really need specific pieces for a full health build.
---
I think I have one each of ghoul slayer,  hunter, exterminator,  zealot, and mutant slayers for 15 dr against all types. Then I just looked for ap refresh and weight reduction.
---
The problem is the amount donated is not reflected by the rarity of the resource. Without farming I was able to get a dozen or so out of steel but only about 5 with concrete.
---
which also has weight.
---
You do you buddy. If your system works for you then thats awesome. Thas all that matters. For me Id rather either buy ammo or make my own gunpowder as needed to craft it. Im at the point in the game where theres not a whole lot left I need caps for so buying it as needed is far more convenient for me
---
Yup same thing I do. I don’t worry about the non legendary ones. Just the ones that are I will bash it and grab my loot and let it stay frozen in space
---
I had big plans about stocking my vendors with steath suits/helmets and shielded SS underarmor lol fuck me i guess
---
There are some of us (myself included) that feel the rewards simply do not match the cost.
---
Wow I forgot about those
---
I quit NW because it is too predictable with loot boxes being in the same place every match.
---
Even then it's no need to be salty, just because OP made an error in judgement.
---
If he really has a "high" level char, that means he understands the mechanics and should have tried to kill the alpha first.
---
You probably should send in a ticket and/or a private message to CMs with the info rather than coming to a sub if mostly players and telling everyone of the exploit, how it more or less works, and revealing that there's a YouTube source for those interested.
---
Just probably.
---
By the end of the event, the entire southeastern corner of the map has just become watoga's new parking lot
---
I did not know that, have you got a heatwave over there too? In Britain we are roasting &amp; our homes aren't designed with hot weather in mind.
---
--
---
Back on topic  but you are probably right. I'd imagine there are many more North American players than us in Europe for example
---
So sometimes if I move over quick I have like a half second to grab it. But it’s not as a sure thing as the bash method I do. So I just keep doing the bash method
---
For the scavenger trader, I've found a consistent spawn to be just south of the blood eagle camp at the top of the map. idk if this is more or less consistent than the one outlined here
---
Although I agree with your sentiment that this is a Bethesda controlled event, and they are free to do with the metrics whatever they see fit, I believe some of these milestones could be made fail intentionally to seem it more believable and player driven.
---
Seems like you just have opinions and not really thought out facts about the matter.
---
Man i feel you when i See Youtube vids where guys playing on PC, fast travel from one edge of the map to an other, and the loading time is like 3 sec i always have to cry.
---
On PS it feels like hours i can roll a cig and make a coffee come back and its still loading. 2020 really embarassing.
---
Yea there are a couple of decent ones which dont give treasury notes. I was just referring to those ones.
---
Riding Shotgun is ok, I get bored of it though.
---
I wanted the sign, but without dupers it'd impossible, and not many people duped concrete because you never need a lot of it!
---
I pronounced it like Concord and I wasn't disappointed, kinda sounded like conquered
---
I agree, I'll post another one as soon as I have a minute
---
and i u equip a builder perk?
---
I find that you always have to have something to hide behind...lure it into firing and as soon as it starts step behind a solid object then once the firing is done step out and unload on it...in the legs if possible.
---
This is usually the only way I can survive because that red beam'o'death will get me everytime.
---
I think you're right. That makes a lot of sense.
---
And alcohols
---
Originally I was going to donate lots. But the rewards suck.
---
They owe us the double score for the auto complete bug THAT IS STILL HAPPENING!
---
Exactly where my brain got it from. Ah, I miss Concord. Good times.
---
Idk what the odds where for me to get the exact same type of weapon, but a now that I've tested it better version for it is. But I think my 13 luck may have come in handy
---
The rewards from this event are all available through other means, which is part of the problem. If you are lower level and need the plans and want the grenades and liquor I will happily give you whatever material I can spare, but I personally wont get anything out of it, so I dont bother.
---
If you are on x box and want some plans I can donate an ass load for you.
---
The interior cell spawns are quite a bit harder to document so I probably won't have got them all. I just checked and in fact there is a rusty pick fixed spawn!
---
I must admit their numbers do not seem overly realistic to me &amp; I have Fo1st. It must be really hard for non Fo1st members
---
Yeah. I knock out the challenges in about 30 minutes most days. The weekly ones take about two hours on one day. Then I'm done playing.
---
where do you see the current progress?
---
I’ve always hated fighting ghouls in general. Fast annoying do a bunch of damage and rads so I can’t heal fully from them. And always ALWAYS in groups of at least 3. 
---
The only benefit I like about them is they have bad AI when it comes to trying to even find a stealthy target. Half the time ones laying down won’t event get up if you one shot their little friends
---
Although anecdotal, I've also found this to be true. Did a RR last night, no energy weapon users no lag. Xbox. I've done a line in the sand that was so borked after I had to abandon looting and struggled to leave the area, goo and ash piles everywhere
---
Too many Reddit users have no interest in seeing the Devs as anything but a target for abuse, warranted or not. I would put money on the worst offenders having zero knowledge of software development. Wonder how they would feel if their work was publicly torn apart day after day for what are often spurious reasons?
---
Same I have 10s of thousands of steel due to the scrap box &amp; weapon breakdown but I only had about 4000 concrete
---
I know. But I just discovered it and thought others might not yet have.
---
fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
The bomber jacket? I have that as common
---
I have fallout 1st so unlimited scrap space. Also concrete is super common in my experience. Stuff like garden gnomes and bags of concrete are everywhere.
---
It better frickin not!! We have enough limits already.
---
I have saved up 4k bullion in the hopes the BOS has a vendor that accepts it.
---
i know this is a joke but seriously i think it would be so funny if after all this “hype” the bos are no shows
---
In silo charlie there are a bunch that get me almost everytime (i play bloodied due to carry weight). Now i got marsupial and jump on the top of a trailer and pick them out in vats with my gatling gun. In vault-tec uni i hop into my power armor and kill them as they come.
---
they are not reflective of what even those of us with a bottomless pit scrap box have in hand. Steel was easy, but I can see us failing the rest badly
---
Sounds like a troll trying to get people to screw themselves with the ammo factory,  which permanently eats camp budget even when deleted
---
Completely agree with this.
---
True. But you can you VATS to and e
---
hit them big time a moment right after they for under and also a moment right when they emerge.
---
Many people that are not a VATS based character forget they also have it. I talk about myself also.
---
I play with my boyfriend (it's how we met!) and we have so much stupid fun together. Your wife sounds like a hoot.
---
ah cool thanks.
---
It would have worked if it were an actual community challenge where you had to get materials from public workshops instead of just dropping it  in at will.
---
I want it but I just don't have that much spare concrete
---
I'm out of the loop lol, how has this dude made a name for himself haha
---
I always so monster mash as a co-op event with my friends.
---
Do you usually use fast travel? If you do, you could try just walking from place to place and exploring. I’ve found some pretty cool places in the game because I don’t use fast travel unless for an event, and it makes the game more interesting. You could try befriending and helping new players, I find that also keeps things interesting. And you could hunt for any legendaries you still want.
---
They already missed that boat with Wastelanders.
---
Im level 219 and my SS set is currently a bunch of random prefixes because I was running out of space in my stash to store the duds while trying for Vanguards (never got a single piece) and stopped caring in the end. Ive got a Life Saving, Weightless, exterminators, mutants and a troubleshooters piece amongst it. I just cherry picked based on the other bonuses. Itll do for now until I can be bothered having another shot at something better.
---
Can you post a vid of you doing this? Because I've never heard of it being possible to do this way
---
A bear costume would be awesome! To be more perfect we could also have picnic basquet loot bag
---
Lvl 288 and I already have a full set of ultracite on a frame and a set of excavator but looking for more chassis to store other sets on. 
---
Tried the lumber yard, Aaronholt homestead, nuka-cola plant, gorge junkyard, Morgantown trainyard, black water mine, grafton dam,  aktos pharma, every where in watonga where it can spawn, mount blair, Delta, the power stations and a bunch of others. 
---
Been using fallout out wiki to scout out other locations and still nothing on private or public.
---
IMHO they are going to build a foothold in Appalachia. A *foundation* of some sort.
---
I have donated loads I just don't think people have that much concrete
---
I’d need tech data to do that.
---
I remember beta when they just casually ignored the cooldown of it and you'd be in a hellstorm of blinding bullshit for minutes at a time
---
absoluty. i dont have 1st and especially concrete, cork and plastic are nearly useless to me (dont build much, dont use laser weapons and what is cork even used for?) so i always dump the amount im over 100. gotta household with these 800 lbs.
---
Ghouls, any kind. They put Usain Bolt to shame.
---
Ha!Got eeem!hey that sounds damn good.im happy for you.I searched for a explosive revolver for a while and it's really good early game or late game with trash mobs
---
No offense :) Always nice to help others
---
done before I posted
---
\*Puts tinfoil hat on\* 
---
Well, I am sure the BoS already has scouts in Appalachia and they probably confiscated every piece of Power Armor. Ya know, can't live from concrete and cork alone.
---
More serious answer: stumbled over various frames this week (PC, though), I think there was even a daily challenge to scrap 3 pieces of it
---
If they wanted people to waste their resources on this event then they should have made it worth while to do it. Anyone with spare resources already has pretty much everything their offering.
---
I have over 6000 concrete and I probably will never use it all I would be happy to give it away for something if it was worth it but for a few bottles of beer and yet more plans I have to drop at train stations because no one will even buy them for caps! Literally can't give most of them away!
---
Yeah I mainly used my old gun in the forest or ash heap, or toxic valley, better than using up all my 5.56
---
If they didn't patch the dupe we'd be able to do it!
---
They work on computers, don’t see how the working from home angle would be anything but a positive. Unless maybe all their devs are extroverts and maybe there lies the problem
---
Or sell.
---
Followed by the Brotherhood of Cork
---
I havent built like that yet.kinda want to but too impatient to play a instrument to get in.i have seen some camps where I fast travel into the ground and when it's done the right way is very nice
---
My thing is I don't need more fucking beer and grenades.  Give me plans or a few different outfits.  I don't want to bust my ass for a few grenades and alcohol.  I would love the banner but not worth my 3000 concrete or cork or anything for such BS rewards
---
Pretty much. I can understand wanting things to start on the ground, but there shouldn't be so many limitations after that. They could even offer am invisible block for those who want to make a floating structure.
---
I think not, the comments indicate people using it and it "working". Theorietically it does not affect camp budget as there is no save but there were some complaints about that.
---
Well, SDD is mandatory for Fallout games.
---
&gt;PC, fast travel from one edge of the map to an other, and the loading time is like 3 sec i always have to cry. On PS it feels like hours i can roll a cig and make a coffee come back and its still loading. 2020 really embarassing.
---
Well, since it is a "pro" version of PS4, and also a Samsung EVO SSD... it hurts a bit. I do not mind lower graphics settings... but leave me at least those 30fps, not that 60 is an enjoyable minimum for first person shooters...
---
That's terrible. I wanted to buy that!
---
Idk, maybe they're working with extremely limiting hardware?
---
Cork makes terrible butt plugs. You want silicone ideally
---
I'm laughing like Risitas looking at this tracker. Holy shit what an absolute failure on their part, no clue what a realistic number is.
---
I did the messenger event in the mire once.   It spawned 4 groups of 5 level 68 Yao Guai.   I died so many times.
---
I was curious, but seeing how it was done was even funnier than when you had me at "we made a brahmin launcher"
---
Once you're inside, you can use a bench or piano to get in through the wall if it's into a cliff or building! Or a bass to get in though the floor if it's underneath.
---
Well let's hope for an industrial miracle then haha
---
Fr I do hope something works out, it is a nice callback to the flagpole banners in fallout 1, I just think it's suffering cuz it's really not as exciting as the other items
---
I had my first platform base experience yesterday, and safe to say, it was amazing lol
---
I have a huge stockpile of scrap mainly do to me taking everything that's not nailed down.
---
I loot the concrete bags from the cemetery in the south west corner of the map near the farm workshop. There is a church overrun with mothman cultists, but there is a small shed to the west with a bunch of cement and fertilizer bags. I found that place when I was first building my camp and looking for concrete for foundations.
---
Dupers didn't dupe concrete, nobody needs that much concrete!
---
You can do any kind of material wall if it's built in half sections. So wood half killed with flame thrower, then elevate it a little on a shelf and destroy the top half. Once it's all gone, build on the other side and then repair both halves.
---
Just incase you don't like brick
---
That makes so much sense :D
---
Im pretty sure this event was done to just drain people of the mass amount of junk they had. A lot of junk in circulation came from when those big vendor dupes existed.
---
I've got a good stash of heavy weapons and some of my highlights are
---
Bloodied Gauss Minigun with limb damage and +Dr while aiming - primed it for ammo efficiency
---
Bloodied minigun - shreds a bunch of stuff easy
---
Vampires reduced weight flamer - great for keeping my alt alive
---
But my most consistent and effective weapon, beating even the Gauss stuff, is my Vampires Explosive LMG. So many godrolls but this somehow seems to perform even better or more usefully than my bloodied lmg. Ammo's kind of a bitch so I'd consider looking into a .50 cal
---
That’s awesome to hear.
---
Assaultrons are the worst when they catch you off guard. I don't understand why in this game they can just shoot the Lazer non-stop without cool down or charging. Kinda ridiculous. But the mirelurk King's are the worst. Small hitbox and rather quick with ranged attacks.
---
oh okay... i guess.. :(
---
You get what you paid for, welcome to the real world.
---
Don’t quote me on this but I think those resource collectors can be destroyed further. Not playing currently so I can’t test it
---
Yes!   
---
This is a great idea!
---
I like the idea with a twist.
---
Add faction specific public teams and have the donation mechanics so each faction can build up their base.
---
Responders in Flatwoods.
---
BOS at the National Radio site. 
---
Raiders at Mezzanine level in Top of the World. 
---
Etc
---
I've had the most luck at Black Bear Lodge, Fort Defiance and Grafton Dam. I think there were 1 or 2 other places, but can't remember off the top of my head
---
Down with Russel. Lets throw him on the scrap pile.
---
Not sure if I'm facing the same/similar issue.  
---
My game is freezing very often, for like 1-10 seconds, no matter where or what I'm doing, I can just stand still and everything freezes, started to happen few weeks ago.  
---
No issues at all with other games.  
---
i7-9700k/rtx 2080s/16gb ram- I don't think that I should face any freezing issues with those specs.  
---
Created ticket for the support - first one was closed as duplicate for some reasons.  
---
Second one is under investigation:   
---
&gt;I am escalating this matter to a specialized team so you may get the best resolution possible. 
---
Like 3 or 4 times attached dxdiag / msinfo files, they are keep asking for that again and again.  
---
They think that root cause of issue is "dynamic or variable IP address".
---
I managed yesterday with a bunch of stimpacks and power armor. you can go in for a few seconds and come back out, find more stimpacks / radaway, then go back into it and the time with continue where it left off!
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
I've given up calling out legendaries. Too many bad experiences trying to be nice.
---
If you're not around to tag it, too bad - better luck next time. Same goes for me - if I miss out, no big deal.
---
I'm so behind on bullion from starting late that I would grind my fucking face off submitting if I got bullion from it
---
This was in F04 and it was a nice addition to settlements so why not.
---
Same, after squandering 10k for nothing and wasting my time from now on I'll donate the minimum of each material just in case Bethesda decide to give the rewards to those who made a donation instead.
---
If you have a 1,000 saved surely you'll be missing out on all the script from now until then?
---
On a somewhat more serious yet conspiracal note, I legitimately believe they made these quotas ludicrously high so that they can sell the rewards in the ATOM shop later.
---
I was with you until the Fortnite part. The world(s) vastly changing over time isn’t a Fortnite thing - it’s originally an MMO staple. 
---
The event is actually quite interesting from an evolving world perspective and I much more prefer the interaction than “look at random prop that was moved upside down in update Z. Must be the world changing.” The event is just tedious and isn’t worth the payout and defeats the quirky lore side of it.
---
I have had this bug aswell
---
The first day I donated steel and then I just boarded it for myself afterwards. Need it for crafting!
---
*hoarded not boarded. Damn auto correct😁
---
I hope they don't just end up turning everything into a big *crater* when their down.
---
This is concrete evidence the people over at Bethesda don't even play their own game.
---
“No you fucking idiot”- Bill Nye
---
Are you on PS4?
---
I think you meant the plastic stock. The cork will be used for boards for tallies
---
I just checked the event tracker to see how much concrete they've actually gathered.  4.65 million out of 150 million needed and it ends tomorrow.  
---
 
---
Title is accurate.
---
Kill Russell
---
ignorant idealism isnt a crime. best we let things play out. his heart may be broken but he'll be wiser for it.
---
I usually use up my Gunpowder pretty quickly, I use .45 which isn't super common, but I use a Lever Action, so I don't use it up super quickly. However I always buy some whenever I see it in a player vending machine and the last 2 weeks I have found several thousand in player vendors. Plus unlocking the Armco Ammunition machine and the Raider Collectron gathering ammo. I currently have 6000 and in a good week I will use maybe 2000. I won't be crafting any anytime soon. I am already seeing my gunpowder storage fill up.
---
You mean they purposedly sabotaged our chances? That's silly.
---
*cough* auto-completed SCORE *cough*
---
Yea I hear that. Specific loot drops make the grind ok for me. I just wish there were more like it.
---
Exactly. This is all just a scheme to remove duped items from the server memory.
---
We will be waiting for longer than we've been told, and when they do arrive the quests will be "go here and retrieve technology"
---
oh how i wish i could pay my hard earned atoms on a batting helmet in like black or yellow
---
Hate the people on fences and tents. Tried with whatever station and people were standing on it and nearby crashed tanks instead...so it’s basically the people on the server not the location that you need to think of
---
This definitely goes to show that the people who came up with the numbers definitely don't play the game. Steel was easy to get, join Line in the Sand a few times or run West Tek/Huntersville a couple times, boom, thousands upon thousands of steel. However, play 76 for hundreds of hours and you only end up with a couple thousand concrete in the long run. As much as I hate to say it, I have 600 hours in the game on one character alone. When the concrete donations started up, I took a look into my scrapbox to find that I only had 2500 concrete after 600 hours in game, but to be fair, I don't pick it up everytime I see it. Either way, unfortunately we are doomed, 4.65 million in one day isn't going to cut it sadly.
---
During the infinite jetpack glitch I did it, it was awesome
---
i know the marine wetsuit weighs a little bit extra as well
---
Yep, Pentium 2.
---
wait, do you mean to say you can’t apply a mod like buttressed to ss armor wth the camo paint on!?
---
Are you a developer?
---
I have been saving up my cloth, because the collectron is the one thing that I really want out of the whole event. I have about 8k cloth ready to donate. I have been making regular trips to the house in Summersville and gathering up all the books.
---
im in a similar spot aha. thank you for this!
---
Forward Station Delta is just as bad, only it has more trenches and the fissures are closer so people fall in sometimes during the chaos.
---
Anything would just be a bandaid for the fact that the SBQ *still* can't be crippled and the fix is repeatedly being pushed back without notice or explanation. Fixing that would fix everything 🤷‍♂️
---
and why does somebody have to drop tp their death?  Make the mat a surface to stand on, give players the shorttime immunity similar to login in in rad zones and you're safe. Arrive in a trap camp on a cliff? Open the map and travel away. Arrive in a safe camp? Wait for stuff to load and explore the camp.
---
thats part of the draw for me! tysm
---
I was talking to Satan and he no help either.
---
Its now 35 years after all the Brotherhoods came. The Brotherhood of Plastic and Brotherhood of Cloth are at war. The Brotherhood of Wood *glassed* the Brotherhood of Leather. Things are truely different now.
---
Not usually and certainly not by intent.  A few things have slipped through at times like the seedy she'd, though unsure if they have fixed that.
---
Please don't give them more ideas for terrible boring community grind events.
---
My most hated enemies
---
1) Assaultrons (Thanks i never thought about "sweep the leg")
---
2) Floaters (Those mofos come in groups of 3-4 EVERYTIME)
---
3) The Charred Feral Ghouls (The fat ones, the radiation they give off is irritating)
---
4) Sheepsquatch (Need I say less)
---
5) Mirelurk Kings (ITS CRAZY HOW FAST THOSE GUYS ARE!!! You reload during VATs from a few yards away, next thing you know their in your face singing Karaoke)
---
Damn, of course it’s a BoS conspiracy. It’s that bloody Russel. He’s not using those robots to fortify Atlas he’s sending them out to collect all the power armour for the Brotherhood’s return. 
---
Clearly he heard about Maxson sending Taggerdy and the rest off to fight the scorchbeasts without power armour. 
---
The proof is here for us all to see. Stop donating cork and don’t donate concrete until Russel actually starts using it and not stealing all the power armour!!! 😂
---
I think that is to do with the cut presidential quest for the Enclave.
---
It's because it's called Software Development and not Software Writing. If running a large project there's often no substitute for face to face meetings to work on ideas or tackle problems. Conference calls are great but are far less useful for throwing around ideas as it's best run in a rather linear and hierarchical format to maintain order. And if there's paperwork to sign you are definitely stuck.
---
Or even allow then for all players but give a option like we currently have for the FT confirmation "Would you like to travel there for x caps?" "There's a FT mat at camp. Use that or normal spawn?" and then you choose one
---
Totally agree, Line in the sand can put me up to 1000 weight before I go upstairs &amp; scrap it. Just in weapons, that is a shed load of steel. I had around 4000 in concrete in my scrap box, before I started donating it
---
Interesting. Each time I have fought her there, she was down within minutes. Even though there may be some stuff there people could stand on, tends to be smaller objects and less viable to stay on top of the entire time.
---
Afraid not. Xbox :)
---
Not discrediting, but do you have proof other than word of mouth? Sneak has been such a controversial topic and have yet to see a repeatable test to prove so.
---
Yeah it also has a wall missin at the back so you can just walk through it. It's absolutely useless now.
---
Mad cuz bad.
---
I used to use my Lever Action as my main weapon so i hear you one .45 not being too commonly available to buy. I used to craft more ammo then. I also use Final Word as my weapon of choice in SBQs. That thing eats .50 rounds. So sometimes I need to craft that too. Ive been pretty lucky though in finding enough of it lately in players vendors so havent needed to craft for quite a while. Plus Ive started using my furious handmade a bit more and have the ammo maker set to 5.56.
---
😂😂
---
Thank you so much I have been trying to find flux for so long and couldn’t figure out the best location
---
Ah, I guess those might help. But, really, a Double XP event would help more than the Double Score. The Double SCORE only applied to the Daily events last time, and it didn't do much to improve my rankings. But, with the Double XP, I moved five places before I ever bothered to check.
---
Whoever came up with the shit tier rewards should go with them
---
No loyalty 😂
---
yeah you spawn a little north of the camp machine. But it gets a bit annoying always making sure the entrances are to the north. Makes so many locations not viable if you want people to spawn in in front of the main entrance.
---
people!  please don't scrap ur clothing.  put it in ur vendor for cheap.  i buy random things i didnt want to keep and then feel like playing dressup on the reg!
---
suggested outfits: raven mask and patches three peice suit.  owl mask and tattered mole outfit. 
---
tips: many items (like gas masks, bandanas and glasses) go beneath the fashionable raider hat and gillie suit head.
---
that being said: ghillie suit, mask (nw rewards) and mothman glasses (atom shop)
---
thanks for the list!
---
Singing karaoke 😂
---
Also, meat piles need their hitbox adjusted. When lying on ground really close to energy weapon dust pile, the meat pile can become basically untargettable, becasue the dust pile seems to have larger hitbox. It can easily happen in Line in the Sand, when people cheese the event to make the Scorched spawned in front of the lure.
---
Another issue with meat pile hitbox is in Uranium Fever. The dirt piles that are used in places where Mole Miners spawn also can obstruct interaction with meat piles. Basically, if a Miner is killed on the spawn (where the dirt pile is) then the meat pile can hardly be targetted and sometimes in completely hidden under the dirt and can be only indentified by the flies above it.
---
We actually have the same PC specs and personally I don't think that's the issue as we should both be able to run the game with ease. My main issue is that when I stop moving inside of instanced interiors, my character freezes and I cannot do anything other than move my camera and jump, after about 3-5 seconds of holding down the movement keys, my character will start moving again, however sometimes I just haven't been able to move at all and I have to either exit and reenter my PA or exit the game all together.
---
yeah let´s keep it that way ;)
---
And I don't understand how the fattest charred ghouls can run the fastest.. 🧐
---
Seriously. How is there no in game info, quest line, counter, etc. ?
---
This is a known problem that seems to affect random people across all platforms. I’ve been dealing with it for months and been in touch with Bethesda support numerous times. I’ve tried everything they have suggested that wasn’t outrageous.
---
A fix for some people seems to be port forwarding. I tried this, however, I have 3 XB1’s in my house and it would only let me assign it to one. This doesn’t work for me because I regularly use 2 of the consoles myself and my husband and son use the others. I’m the only one with FO1st and we can’t play together anymore on my private server. We don’t even appear on each other’s social tabs anymore either.
---
The same thing happened to my dad, who lives in a nearby town and also a FO1st subscriber. None of us can see him on our social tab anymore and he can’t see us.
---
It’s kinda ruined the game for us because we used to all play together regularly. I won’t be renewing my subscription in a month or so, whenever my year is up. I certainly won’t be donating any scrap to the BOS either lol.
---
Why would we want to support the BOS in the first place.
---
How’s the gauss minigun it’s supposed to be magic dominator? Can you solo sbq in one mag.?
---
Yep. There should be multiple events  happening constantly. A bunch of simple fetch and fight style events. Some escorts missions. Themed events that are themed by season.
---
How about more player activated events? It doesn't have to be triggered by a nuke. 
---
We"re almost two years in. This should have been their focus for at least the last year.
---
Thank you for this reply. I moved my camp yesterday and now I know why it isn't showing up!
---
At the same time, there is no point what so ever in trying to downplay the incompetence routinely on display with Bethesda. Covid isnt causing this, working from home isnt causing this. Poor management is causing this. Full stop.
---
I dont think the devs should be personally assaulted or threatened, but they do 100% bear the blame for the heartbreaking state of Fallout 76. Professionally, they deserve to be the laughing stocks that they are. I wish it werent so. I wish this game could see its full potential. I love fallout. Its one of my all time favorite IPs. But i play fo76 *despite* the best efforts of its devs, not because of them.
---
Whats most interesting to me is the generalized belief that it’s totally justified that bethesda in order to “stop dupers” the immense majority of us non dupers have to scrip away, stash away or destroy our hard earned modules/junk/bullion making pieces under the “well known” rng from the game and suck it up.
---
No solid arguement.
---
The “earn it” argumens was fair, but you gotta earn the fixer and I dont see anyone complaining or bgs doing anything about being able to trade the newly and massively duped fixers right?
---
Oh, sorry might have just misread it.
---
Brotherhood of Steal
---
nice! But you actually can do it without using any glitches
---
Stay stealthy, and have a tree or wall nearby so you can jump behind it as soon as the beam weapon fires up
---
We won't get the reward but the bos base will be built up. Theyre not going to go through and base the texture of the bos base off our donations. That would be kinda silly and require bethesda to actually do something.
---
Entire servers would be farmed clean.
---
Enclave for life 👍🏻
---
It should have been atoms. You get 25 atoms for every 2,500 donated.
---
Easy. Divide the cork numbers by [the number of players known in January](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/fallout-76-player-count#:~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20this,million%20copies%20sold%20at%20launch) (e.g ~400k) and it neatly comes out to 500.
---
Very clearly they didn't adjust for non-participants. This, like most other FO76 problems, comes down to a lack of experience problem. The studio working on FO76 is not staffed with Bethesda veterans, and even if it was no-one in Bethesda made an MMO. Zenimax is a parent company, and was making the MMO before they skinned it for TES. The few people with multiplayer experience have *mobile* experience, not proper MMO experience.
---
No
---
Distributed software development teams are a thing. Google, Microsoft, any big company has distributed teams. Are they producing poor software because people aren’t co-located, don’t think so. Programmers need less meetings and more heads down development time to get stuff done.  Meetings are a killer of productivity.
---
Minecraft simply won't do because everything is ugly.  
---
You and many people here complain about my complaints because I wasn't prepared enough, because I should have thought about many things earlier, because I should be more organized. You're right. I am a sloppy, untidy bastard.  
---
But that's exactly the point I'm making. Even after playing for weeks, I'm basically still doing the things I did when I just started. Am I supposed to remember the ingredients to every recipe by heart? Do you guys know every component of every item in the game and every specification for repairing or building, so you know exactly what to pick up and what to leave behind? It seems like I'd have to use a spreadsheet or hire a project manager just to get through the day.  
---
I realize there may be a learning curve, but this is micro management on a level that doesn't even exist in the meat-o-verse. Like I said, that may be appealing to some of you who like to keep things neat and tidy (and also explain the high amount of near sterile camps I encounter), but it's not for everyone.  
---
I feel they've made just getting by on a daily basis way too hard and complicated in FO76, not because they want us all to be neat, tidy and well prepared, but because they were extremely sloppy in their development of the game. All the tiny aspects you have to consider, know about and remember all the time, everything just got stacked onto a pile without anyone asking themselves how it would affect game play. I think their sloppyness also shows in the way they've organized the inventories. I know by now gunpowder is under the Misc tab; I've learned the hard way. My question is: *why*?? Why isn't it under the junk tab, just like all the other components? I don't see the logic of it, and I assume it's there just because someone put it there by accident and no one ever bothered to move it. Why are the plans and armor listed with a long list of possible adverbs *in front* of the actual item name? I find it hard to believe that was done intentionally. Probably because some sloppy programmer just did it that way without thinking how it would make searching for specific items a repetitive, tedious drag.
---
Well, there goes the conspiracy theory that the online progress bar is just for the show and Bethesda plans to autocomplete all the donations...
---
The provision box rewards already did that for me. Im really hoping they rework them for next week.
---
Sadly not all that common I’m afraid. Glad to see you had some good experiences lately!
---
I know right? Scrip it or destroy it!!!
---
You guys know this is a challenge, right ?
---
Like I said, hold them accountable.
---
dataminers already found the mods for them in the files but they forgot to tie them to their supposed vendor. (Apparently all the other missing mods are there too but not assigned yet)
---
That ain't it, Chief.
---
And 200,000,000 concrete as it's more prevalent, what do you think that goal will be met? The goal for the steel was met sometime on the third day probably early... Wood cloth and plastic will all be the same way. Good luck on cork. I will screws do exist in the world no one ever seems to happen because screws are used to repair almost everything. Would you forego a thousand of your screws or would you rather repair all of your weapons and armor?
---
Ok
---
they will just break the game trying haha.  i say maybe just remove it from the legendary perk pool.  then we can have legacy bash guns too 😎   looking for legacy bash flamer
---
Yeah it's pretty good. It helps add to the amount of things I craft and stacks with Chemist and Ammosmith which doubles ammo crafting.
---
Same on PC. I got a nice 8bit game the other day.  Eye roll
---
Whoever made this community junk drive a thing is a low iq we eb that is waste of Bethesda budget. Why would anyone go out of there way to do this with how the games daily limits are.
---
I was about to say this too. Large scale software dev isn't done by solitary programmers like modding or hobby stuff might be. 
---
Adding to this are the amount of distractions in a work-from-home setting. Any parents working from home know this better than anyone.
---
Ya, the SS set is pretty great. At this point all the content is pretty easy so I just went with QOL stuff. Lol
---
They also said they added pocketed and deep-pocketed for the limbs but...
---
Just outta curiosity, why are people wanting the T60 plans so much? Isn't X01 a lot better anyway?
---
No I just keep using 150-200 a day, then topping up. I've learned to play that way now.
---
Sent, my psn is gmaat3 so if you see a request from that name it’s me
---
Judging by some of the other posts on this a warning is not enough for some people as they ignore them then decide its bethesdas fault for only giving them 1 warning before destroying something
---
Like even as a BOS member, once I saw the banner in game I was a little like... why? Its low tech and looks like something any junker could build.
---
I was wondering why concrete deposits (yeah I know) don’t seem to work anymore. Did they remove the concrete extractor ?
---
Dang I would pay atoms to see Daguerre on a pole dance lol
---
From what I read this issue is caused by the presence of Tesla Rifle ash piles. I can't recall if there's any difference between Tesla ash and regular laser ash. But anyway, these ash piles apparently cause the issue. Meat piles should be fine...
---
I would imagine devs would take their workstations home with them, not just for development but for security reasons as well. There's still some limitations like their internet service, though; they mentioned in the Quakecon Q&amp;A that they sometimes ran into issues with some devs having to upload their work over slow internet speeds.
---
The skin thing is annoying. Just fucking slow down and pay attention. Good lord.
---
&gt; Edit: also always crouch. It forces her to land in search of her targets
---
Does that work for all scorchbeasts?
---
~~Itl be autocompleted by the devs.~~
---
Itl be met by a mysterious surge of last minute "donations".
---
I get it theyre people but they also love money. They were so proud of Stanfield and eso. They rushed through fo76 like the bastard child it is. My problem is the lack of care, theirs no passion and it shows when we get a side by side preview with their other works. Fo76 is a cash grab and it shows, they don't even try to hide it. Thats probably the biggest criticism for me and the rest of the community who has been here since the start of the fallout universe. Its a very loyal fan base and to see they shit all over something we love, time and time again, it gets frustrating.
---
I was thinking this was referring to mama dolche’s
---
kinda annoying that their strategy with their updates is also to get us to keep playing the same old events...when 1W drops, every event will scale to us an they will consider this content.
---
With all heavy weapon damage perks, full nerd rage, full stabilized in power armour, full bloody mess, adrenaline, with a shot of psycho, and a covert operative boost, I still seem to do less damage to the queen's face than with my vampires explosive LMG. 
---
Either I'm doing something wrong or there's some other special circumstance that I'm not experiencing. I spent ages getting this Gauss minigun and it's so far one of my worst heavy weapons
---
It's more to complete the plans and the brotherhood paint jobs only go on T60/Armour not much more to do as high level at moment.
---
It's fine, as long as people don't crowd into inside the structure. She keeps trying to land, and ends up hitting the tree, and the  lands whilst still technically in the air and takes off a second later. The tents are still there, and the people outside the structure still struggle to agree on which side of it they are going to fight her on so everyone is basically running around it chasing each other's tails. Add in the trenches and fissures.. it often becomes a 25 minute ordeal.
---
My point is that no matter what structure you position it around.. the problem is the *people* so the result will be the same. But that would be bypassed if the wings could be crippled again, as is promised again and again to be addressed in the ever-illusive "next patch"
---
That is definitely clear. You would also think that developers who made Fallout 76 would be more aware of the amount of resources available. Oh well, it looks like I'll be purchasing that banner for 500 Atoms.
---
I would recommend applying 2mm rounds via Bloodied Gauss Minigun directly to the face or legs until it stops being a problem.
---
Doesn't that location feature in the Wastelanders questline? It's been a while now, but I know I ended up there when following Wastelanders quests.
---
Im a FO1st sub and a meticulous looter/junker. I pick up everything I see! I had 1000 conc and 1000 cork. There’s no way we get those rewards if the above average user has only 1k to give.
---
If anything it would have been buggy. I've already completed wastelanders, took my daughter with me on her low level to do some stuff. Raiders had no issue attacking her. Even after I started killing them they stayed friendly to me, they never mind that I take out their friends. She was fair game to them.
---
I also don't feel he owns the right to gift those stuffs, I mean, in lore wise it just weird
---
Is it before? I was pretty sure it was after because you need the ID card to get into the enclave bunker. But yes, I found the free states quests pretty forgettable (and I grouped them into the enclave because that quest chain leads into the bunker).
---
Also, I don't see a real viable parallel for them and they're all dead which means that there's no good way to revive them or replace them. But, I could be wrong, and there could be a yet undiscovered free states bunker that they'll all emerge from in February (when I expect the next big expansion to drop).
---
Ahhh, ok.
---
It tend to be their *modus* operandi.
---
\&gt;  Ghoul colossus  
---
Please, god, no.
---
\*Joining Event: Ghoul Colossus at Whitesprints\*  
---
\*You have contracted Rad Worms\*
---
It sucks but it's just random when it will unlock. I gotta think you're close though. Maybe it's better to do a bunch at one time? I crafted level 40 to scrap, if that's any help. Still takes a ton of mats to make them but I was determined to get it. I probably scrapped 9 in a row and it unlocked.
---
RIP Poon’s camp
---
Ah fair enough man. Yeah, I recently hit level 207 and it's becoming harder and harder to even keep my interest. The lack of content updates and the lackluster Season One is killing my soul.
---
You can squeeze out a tiny bit more rep by giving the photos to ward for no money. Forgot the robots name that gives you the quest but he lives in the overseers basement.
---
True lmao. They'd probably make every drop have bash damage, just like when almost every melee weapon dropped with limb damage
---
To expand: ALWAYS keep screws. They're hard to find.  Springs are less rare, but almost as useful.Adhesive, my particular bane in FO4, can be cooked with a pure water and 2each Mutfruit/Tato/Corn.
---
Get the Scrapper and Super Duper perks as soon as you can, with Green Thumb a close third.
---
I contributed 250 concrete out of the 500 in my stash, that was all I was willing to give.  Steel was a little different since I had around 7000 and didn't mind giving up.
---
I used to hate Assaultrons the most when i first started playing. Now i mostly just hate mole rats.
---
gonna do the same, I gave 250 steel and I will give 250 concrete and no more!
---
Very fair. Personally, I'd prefer to delay the content in the next few patches and work just on bugs. It's getting insane at this point. Why add new content when it gets to be a challenge and frustrating to play with the bugs.
---
Participation trophy!!! 😂🤣😂 I too want something for nothing.
---
I agree entirely.
---
Looks promising lol. Is there a plan/recipe glow mod working you know of? I tried to get one but it did nothing.
---
And the one stopping me from progressing the raider questline.
---
I don't miss the Brotherhhood of Steel, better stay where they are now.
---
Someone did a guide for farming concrete and if you farm the whole of Appalachia, there's only about 300 concrete to be had. That takes about 90 minutes of farming not including bumbling around. A little quick math: 150,000,000/300 = 500,000 runs which would take 750,000 manhours. To put that into perspective, it took 7 million manhours to build the Empire State Building. We're being tasks to build 1/10th of the Empire State Building in 4 days.
---
They're probably just returning to build a chain of Wal-Marts.
---
But people can stand on top of the Forward Station, which is just as bad as standing on top of V9.
---
But at least they can't spam the Knight Moreno audio clip, which I suppose is a plus.
---
I was more referring to the fact that those doors have been in place since launch and haven't been openable. They make a good place to drop enclave members without requiring everyone to finish the bunker access quests to interact with the new faction.
---
No they aren’t. No one cares to do the event is the problem.
---
Dude chill out your making yourself out to be a rabid fanboy, I'm a lover of the series too but you can't speak for all of the community as a whole. I love the PvP aspect of 76 I just wish it was more balanced and actually meant something. Honestly if you bought 76 thinking you were going to have a wholesome fallout single player experience then you probably shouldn't have bought into the game, we all knew what it was going to be from the moment it dropped, what everybody is saying is that its part of the game and instead of Bethesda actually trying to find a fair compromise or actually putting the effort into making a decent go of separating the community they would rather pander to the weak AF pve community and completely disrespect the PvP portion by giving them nuclear winter as some kind of shitty participation award. As a veteran of the fallout series it was refreshing to actually have a level of danger readded to the wasteland, AI just doesn't hold up to real players.
---
As of now yes.
---
I got a stimpack extra in a crate I looted, walked into the fire and as soon as some health was knocked off by the fire (no rads involved so no radaway required), I took the stimpack. Health got down to about 1/3 by time the timer recorded 1 minute so I carried on with the match. Easy and 1 minute is not that long really.
---
You're spending caps to get random bottles of booze. It's not worth it.
---
Lovely to see a fellow engineer.
---
You dont lose or miss out on anything if it autocompletes. Theres nothing that happens afterwards. It just abruptly ends.
---
I agree, i just looked and it is still the same number. No way no one has been donating.
---
Now everyone will be attending collision course. And I see enclave event might have a higher attendance rate too.
---
No thanks. Gear durability and potential loss of junk is plenty enough. It would overly punish new players and turn them away. We already have to juggle hunger/thirst, diseases and what not.
---
like [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/84](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/84) ?
---
`[Archive]`
---
`sResourceArchive2List =`  
---
That's all that's needed in your Fallout76Custom.ini.
---
It's a pretty good "random encounter" hotspot. Sheepsquatch can also randomly appear there.
---
Yea? Let's see what happens xD
---
The steel goal was met.
---
Stim worked while in the fire for me. Just took a stimpack extra and got down to 1/3 health when 1 minute recorded.
---
Idk how to calculate all the XP from all the different treasury note events, but I honestly think if you play enough for 23 days to get all the bullion and scrip necessary to get a full set of SS armor you will be higher than 56... just from the fact that I lvl my mule to 50 in a couple of weeks doing nothing extraordinary, just playing in teams and doing events.
---
Just jetpack out
---
I feel like Bethesda is punishing us for just existing at this point.
---
my plans came from line in the sand.
---
Power Fist or Mole Miner Gauntlet will make them not a problem.
---
Bethesda banned them a few weeks ago specifically in preparation for this "event".
---
Also, youre projecting your own insecurities a bit. Turn it down a few notches.
---
Yeah a one star shows up about every ten times I go there
---
Relax. The guy that has to manually type in (!) the number has been comatose all weekend, he'll get up soon enough. My guess: the number will jump to 120m today, and the rest will be 'donated' tomorrow.
---
I think the hardest enemy in this game is bugs and no I don’t mean the insects ;)
---
🏆
---
Number will probably suddenly jump up over the target, and they'll blame it on a glitch.
---
I’m just imagining their wine cellar full of champagne since they have so much cork laying around
---
And weight!
---
Nope. This isn’t intended as a hardcore survival game. Stop trying to make the game suit your desires and go find a game that already does.
---
B51 starts at L30.
---
Too many glass cannons afraid of mobs she spawns.
---
The red and white hard hats can be bought from Sunny bot sometimes at Foundation, not sure about pink though not seen that one yet.
---
Fight fire with fire, stealth
---
I just hope we will make the challenge for the bonus score :D
---
No way?! That I did not expect. Lets see how the concrete goes. It would be nice to have a status counter.
---
They made the goal unrealistic so I don't know what they expected.
---
They can't even tie the progress tracking to an API. They have to go manually pull the data. That hasn't been a thing for MMOs since like 2006.
---
Hell we could be so far behind simply because the dude who can pull the data doesn't work weekends...
---
And its easily the best Levelling PA. The mining yield bonus is of questionable value to anyone who isnt a heavy gunner, but the +100 carry weight bonus is awesome for scrounging or farming runs.
---
F for Poon's camp
---
whenever I get a duplicate hat color I usually sell it for the base price and it will sell within a day.
---
i 100% agree with you. And don't see the need for all the downvotes. It's not like it would be mandatory to play it.
---
So true. Fight from afar on the ground and kill the mobs if you're worried lol... I'm a bloody heavy gunner and love getting up in her face with my weapons.
---
I understand that playing with a dead brain is attractive for some players without skill but I do not agree with the current penalties since they will not matter to you as soon as you have some time played, if you want new players not to run away simply make the penalties not are applied up to X level
---
"Sorry, you didn't make the goal! But you can now get the Flagpole for just 2000 Atoms! This offer will never come back! You don't want to miss out, do you?"
---
Are you on PC? I think this is a video settings issue but I don't remember the specifics.
---
It's a huge missed opportunity - functionally, MODUS could be the most powerful individual / thing in West Virginia. He has access to an orbital strike platform, a working production facility &amp; access to the last vestiges of pre-war government tech.
---
Hence, I believe that many Vault 76 residents would have stayed at the Enclave bunker &amp; re-started the organization &amp; done so rather easily. 
---
In fact, a DLC which had the new Enclave attempt to co-opt or subvert the arriving factions (the Settlers &amp; Raiders) would open up huge opportunities for content and interaction. 
---
That's why I'm writing a novel of Fallout 76 from the point of view of the "New Enclave."
---
I had a concrete joke but I autoscrapped it.
---
Agreed. They are on the list :)
---
Gutsy is a one-shot kill when you target the thruster. Just takes a little finesse on positioning.
---
I can make you one
---
Concrete isn't going to succeed because people don't hoard concrete like they do with steel. Steel is much more vital to many things, including crafting weapons/armor/ammo, repairing, and building many things. Concrete, just some camp stuff for the most part. The goal is unrealistic. Bethy f'ed up.
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)  \- it only updates once a day apparently.
---
I don't see dupers wasting time to dupe concrete
---
Well the things are manually updated, it’s not automatic, so it’s higher than that, BUT the rewards don’t justify the costs
---
Yup. That one is underarmor so 1.1 from memory
---
Are you on xbone I may be able to help With the fixer and another good gun for trade but I only have one explosive radium and it isn't for sale? On the other hand if I were you I would keep that set of unyielding and use it on another charachter who is a bloody build just to try it out I bet you will like it more for adventure mode grinding than your current setup
---
Would you consider your set something worthy for pvp?
---
Cause the low lvls I’m talking about were mega tanky, Like Sentinel/Cavalier Assassin tanky... but of course I got no proof...
---
Once again, my main point is that we earn everything to make them pieces to then only be able to scrip or destroy the ones we dont have a use on a single character.
---
Why not letting us trade them, even if its just with people that know the plans?
---
Best DLC ever
---
&gt;penalizing death is not hardcore, other players are not attacking you, they are not destroying your camp or you lose everything, stop trying to convert fallout in farm ville,  and if you like to harvest go to a game that deals with that
---
what do you mean the same for enclave? They are sitting on a oil rig and they are not showing up until the events of fallout 2.
---
If I wanted a cruel and realistic experience I'd go to work. I want my games to be fun.
---
How so?
---
Fine by me. I want the awards and don’t care if they sucked a bunch of resources from us to get them. If it’s all a facade, that tracks for a game that’s basically run by Vault-Tec.
---
The top of V9 counts as "ground" so standing on it does nothing to discourage the Queen was landing.
---
Forward Station Delta is far closer to the edge of the map, increasing the likelihood that the Queen will die outside of the boundaries &amp; be non-lootable.
---
Personally, I don't care when the nuke lands, as long as there is a fast-travel point close by &amp; I don't have to fight her in the actual nuke zone.
---
There are a lot of misconceptions as to why the Queen lands (or doesn't) - and about 90% of the theories you see people espouse are dead wrong.
---
I’ve honestly never seen much outright offensive criticism on here to be honest. It’s an obvious thing, keep it civil and yes they’re accountable to some extent. But it’s the parent company that holds the responsibility. 
---
No dev walked into work in 2018 and said “I can’t wait to fuck up CAMP building again today”. They want to do a good job, that’s why they’re there. Bethesda giving them poor resources and poor time to achieve it is the problem. 
---
But, if you don’t want your work publicly pulled apart, don’t work for a massive company that produces poor results. It’s really straightforward
---
Nah. I kill myself every few minutes since I mostly can't fast travel due a bug.
---
That would be awesome. I play on steam with the same name. In the evenings West Coast of the US.
---
Yes I am, I'm trying to look into it as well but I'm unsure what it is.
---
&gt; Overlapping objects specifically could lead to server crashing bugs if don’t in certain ways.
---
Yeah, so I've noticed. But it's on them that decorations can disappear behind wallpaper, for example. Mind you, it does not disappear entirely, it still counts for the budget of course, even though you can't see it. Only when scrapping a build did I notice an empty weapons rack had eight hidden heavy weapons in its inventory. A weapons rack should have an inventory that only allows one item. 1.  
---
Too bad I missed the Q&amp;A. I'd have had some suggestions for them. Like being able to reselect a blueprint once it built, so you don't have to scrap every piece seperately and in exactly the right reverse order in which it was originally built.   
---
Like the youtubers you mention, I like some of the quirks the system offers, and I also try to play with them and abuse them a little. The quirks I mean, not the youtubers. :)  
---
So thanks for the tip! Do you know if there's a place where I can offer my suggestions to the dev team?
---
I'm sure there's plenty of players like myself that already know most if not all of the plan rewards - so this is simply a way to deplete our stashes....No thanks!
---
Screw it. Maybe the cloth one for the collectron otherwise screw it. I will fulfill this legendary run but after that I am done for a while until new story content drops. I will never again commit to a legendary run if its timegated like this one. I can only take so much of this.
---
I on purpose reskinned everything on me except my quad gamma gun so I look like a nut you don’t wanna mess with.
---
Its because Sol is supposed to interrupt and hes stuck downstairs like the moron he clearly is. Leave the Wayward and reenter. it usually resets his pathing issues so he can find the stairs up to Duchess and continue the interaction.
---
Yeah, I tried collecting concrete from the "where to farm all the things" spots last night. All gone. Every location already picked clean. You know how much concrete I was able to donate in total this weekend? 250. I don't have FO1st, but was able to add over 3000 steel. I don't know what they were thinking...
---
Sentinel works great in PVE if you are non-sneak build. For day to day playing the game I run 4 pieces of Vanguard/Sentinel/AP Refresh and one piece of Chameleon/Sentinel/Poison. The only thing you have to worry about is enemies that can stagger you.
---
True that! And also, steel, by my knowledge, is far easier to get than concrete. I know of 4 bags in the Uranium Fever mines and thats it. 
---
Thanks for the link on the events. It's going to be a miracle if we get the concrete together.
---
Why? They are piss easy to get. I'm constantly at 29-30k caps.  I've literally depleted the daily caps and then bought a bunch of concrete and then depleted the caps again. A couple of times.
---
&gt; All the events should be worth 20 score and Dailes 10, incentivize people doing them.
---
Disagree;  then it just becomes more of "show up" to get credit.
---
I don't bother with Uranium Fever on a public server.  There is almost always at least 8-10 people doing it.
---
Yeah I was not impressed. I donated some steel, saw the crappy rewards, and I don't plan on participating again🤷‍♂️
---
they announced they are actively trying to figure out how to implement mods, its safe to say itll be on private servers only.
---
True but it has been at the 4 million mark since yesterday, If it's updated daily it should be higher.
---
Unless there is a 100 million there when it is updated. We won't meet the goal by tomorrow when it ends.
---
Also there are way's of making it automated and done in game, really can't understand why the went with manual.
---
At least you aren't ahitting on them because everyone else is
---
I don't find much of anything yields Concrete, and most people use it for their CAMPs anyways.
---
My second toon has been getting 100% of my FO playtime for the past 5 weeks, started it with FO1st, none of CAMP objects use Concrete, loot and scrap everything. Figured the Stashbox had a few donations worth, right? Nope. Not even enough for one. And since they announced this, I'd been making sure not to skip out on lawn gnomes and Bags of Cement, along with looting most everything. Not enough for a single donation.
---
Friend, I’ve been playing Fallout for over 20 years. It was **never** a hardcore survival game or intended as such.  It was a post-apocalyptic RPG.  
---
No Fallout game **ever** had the structure you suggest of severe death penalties. Even Survival Mode wasn’t that harsh. 
---
You’re the one trying to make it into something it never was.
---
Go find a game that suits *your* desires instead of trying to change this one.
---
You're not....in fact I'm not donating a goddamn thing...
---
I love the idea lol I need to get that bear costume too. Also, if they ever bring out that bear costume in diffrent colors we sure as hell cosplay the disney gummy bears. Deal?
---
Yup.  Shoot to tag/Argo them. They will land in the “event” location from where they were shoot from looking for you while u stay hidden.
---
Not the person you asked, but I spend enough time on these forums to theorize (in no particular order): 
---
There's not enough endgame content - once you complete both storylines, there's nothing but an exp/secondary currency grind to do; The PvP system is not good, and there's a lot of people who want PvP in an MMO; There are a lot of bugs in the increasingly elderly engine; The latest "community event" has lackluster rewards; the NPC factions are a bit shallow, and there's no real consequences for picking one side over the other; There are only two "viable" builds (here, "viable" is defined purely by how much damage a character can inflict at a hit), and the enemies aren't scaled for them so Bloodied and Junkies' builds are one-hit-killing everything they come across. Those players then complain that everything is too easy to kill, while those who go against the metagame are struggling with a few enemies (like we're supposed to). 
---
I'm sure that doesn't cover everything, but it hits the high points. Welcome to Appalachia, Vault-Dweller!
---
Ill admit I dont much care for the Enclave and I was a bit of a BOS fan in FO4 but I would prefer the focus of future content be another faction unique to FO76 rather than trying to shoehorn a BOS splinter into existing lore.
---
There were Freestaters probably unaccounted for an mentioned in name only in the lore pieces found in game. We never find Abbies body. Same with Melody Larkin of the Fire breathers. Even some of the Responders could have feasibly fled the region and now hearing the 76ers completed the work they started and could return. Theres the remnants of the army at Foundation. We have the Secret Service that could have been a bridge to the Enclave. Lots that could have been done instead.
---
Great now I have that song stuck in my head. "Don't it always seem to go you don't know what you got til it's gone. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot."
---
&gt; I really like Obsidian as a company and really wish that they had been allowed to continue making fallout games
---
They would have been "allowed to continue making Fallout games", first of all, had Interplay not been run to the ground by people who had no business running a company, which would have allowed the now Obsidian developers to remain at Interplay (and Black Isle), and secondly, had Obsidian purchased the license to Fallout in the auction. Obsidian was, after all, founded in 2003, and Interplay auctioned off the Fallout license in 2004, so Urquhart, Avellone and all those guys must have had a chance to buy the Fallout license when it was being put up to auction.
---
They didn't.
---
And it's not like Bethesda came in to the table with 100 million dollars crushing the competition either. The license sold for around a million dollars.
---
It's a novel idea, that Obsidian should "be allowed to" continue to develop Fallout games, but Obsidian today isn't exactly the same company or the same people who developed New Vegas. Chris Avellone, for example, was done completely dirty by Urquhart and ousted from Obsidian, a company he was one of the founders of. So, there goes all that amazing writing. You wouldn't be having any of that in a new Obsidian Fallout game. And even if Avellone would be able to dig the dagger from his back and ever agree to work with Urquhart, he has been cancelled by #metoo, so he won't be working on any games any time soon, if ever.
---
And, in The Outer Worlds we can see what kind of a "Fallout-style" game Obsidian can put out; short, without content, shallow, with the illusion of choice, and pretty much zero replayability. And no mods. Personally, if I had to pay 60€ for a game, I'd much rather go with Bethesda Fallout 5, which I have no doubt will give me hundreds of hours of entertainment, just like their previous single player games have (in Fallout 4, I've got over 1000 hours), and for me, even 76 has, than pay 60€ for an Obsidian adventure game that lasts 20 hours and that's it, no replayability, forgotten.
---
Don't get me wrong, if it was possible to get the Obsidian that made New Vegas, or the Interplay that made the first Fallout, to make a new Fallout, and not screw over the modding community by using a different engine they don't know how to mod on (assuming the game would even *have* mods), then it might be an intriguing idea.
---
Those companies just doesn't exist anymore. And some of the people in those companies won't be working in the gaming industry anymore either.
---
But that's reality, which always ruins everything when pining for the past.
---
Nice job calling people unskilled. Id like it if people like you lost their characters when they died. Maybe thatd be "hardcore" enough for you.
---
I bet that Nocturnal Boxing glove came as something of a let down.
---
/manlyhug
---
Thanks. You're right, I probably have a lot to learn. But I'm also curious to learn what it is exactly, that you think I don't understand about the game. Is there a hidden layer I'm missing or maybe adding?
---
‘Dead brain’?
---
Explain why you felt the need to be uncivil?
---
This clearly isn’t the game for you, Kevin. So move along.
---
I'll take that as a no for now, but soon™.  Thank you!
---
Try disabling v-sync in the .ini and then capping your framerate in the GPU software. For Nvidia I used [this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/509097/how-to-set-a-maximum-frame-rate-in-nvidias-drivers/).
---
Clearly I'm doing something wrong, because I'm always broke.
---
Great! thanks for the info, how long did it take you to acquire that set?
---
Interested to see todays number in a few hours ... 4M was a bit of a surprise, then I thought - oh, it's a weekend, and nobody at bethesda works on weekends, so whoever cooks the books on this community event didn't have a chance to cook them yet :D
---
On a more serious note, I checked my scrapbox. 555 concrete, 226 cork ... yeah. Fuck that, Brotherhood gets exactly 0 from that. There are enough grinds in the game already, not going to bother picking up golf balls for those assholes.
---
Steel was easy. One "Line in the sand" = 1400+ steel with Scrapper equipped... A bit of cork (1 each) from pipe pistols ...
---
They should get rid of Dr. Evil and find a better guy to come up with those goals ...
---
Bethesda grade shit tier nonsense
---
Possibly true :)
---
How often do you die? I would rather be able to drop it, and free up all that stash space. Ore should probably be Junk as well.
---
Due to the way DR works higher numbers give you diminishing returns. 
---
At 300 DR vs a 200 damage attack you will get more benefit from -15% damage reduction (single piece) than an extra 175 DR from a full set of Vanguard, in fact you’ll need around 525 DR apparently to much the damage reduction effect of a single piece of Slayer gear. 
---
And that’s a 200 damage attack, which is rare. The lower the attack value the pronounced it becomes.
---
Well...more 'concrete' evidence Bethesda doesn't play their own game otherwise they would've known not all resources are as common as some others
---
I got a lucky roll on one of these back when I was much lower level, and used it as my backup weapon until recently. Lvl 40 \*\* Instigating, 40% more power attack. It can one shot anything other than a scorchbeast or sentrybot with a power attack even without adrenal reaction mutation if they are at full health. I don't carry it anymore ever since I got the Gauss shotgun and Gauss minigun, but it has killed so many critters that it definitely earned a place on the wall at my C.A.M.P.
---
If they do come out expect to have to make new characters to use mods
---
What about a recon hunting rifle?  Get her to stay further away from enemies?
---
We got a second Xbox to play together.   My husband was already level 40, but I was lvl 70.  So he's running into assaultrons and colonel gutsies on the Brotherhood quests, and here I am watching his back.  It's better now that he's not dying to everything.   I still mostly use my sniper rifle and he's switching over to a heavy gunner build, so it feels like we work well together like that.
---
I checked his post history he also wants to have free &amp; open PvP. 
---
Combine the two, and he basically wants Rust, it seems like. 
---
So why the hell doesn’t he just go play Rust?
---
Hunger and thirst are going away in a few months.
---
Do you have an Xbox One X?
---
In my experience, the X has nearly zero issues but the S has massive issues with this update. 
---
(Personal experience with an X and S with players in the same event, from the same internet connection. And a friend with an S at the same event describing the same effects.)
---
This! I run with an explosive shotgun and enforcer, cripple and win
---
Yes - Less meeting not No meetings. All the heads down time in the world won't solve every problem, and neither will staring at the exact same screens doing conference calls. There's a reason home working isn't done universally across the board, sometimes personal interaction is more important. 
---
Just because the Devs are responsible for flawed softwares does not mean they are open for abuse of the scale seen here, especially the personal hate that gets thrown around.
---
Heh laser go pew
---
Yeah i have an Xbox one X. Had no lag before at all apart from busy sbq fights and even then it's just a small fps drop
---
Aye, dats alot to bear.
---
Sure. Can you do me a favour and DM me. Otherwise, I will loose track :)
---
Some you win, some you lose
---
At least you can move your camera :))  
---
Looks like we have different issues. I'm also playing in PA, but it doesn't matter, freeze happens in any case.
---
Ya definitely.  Ive only been playing about 3 weeks or so and besides diseases carry weight is the worst.
---
I dont know but he needs get that what he wants will never happen
---
The community would donate 150 billion concrete in 5 seconds for a light up stripper pole our allies can use. Just saying :P
---
It happened to me three times in a row inside of Whitesprings workshop yesterday, I ran down the hallway and jumped up onto a table, and then I was able to FT out of there.
---
I mean, I wouldn't say the game has gained any stability in the most recent patch but hey, A for effort.
---
In this case, I’m a fan of manipulation for a good cause.
---
If you do some math all of these goals are actually easily achievable. If 50k players over 3 platforms donated enough for 1 provision it would equal 12.5 million. The community isn’t even close to that.
---
We need the concrete for the double-sided wall workaround they've forced on us 😂
---
No, but then Im not worthy of PVP. Period. Im garbage and it wouldnt matter what armor I have.
---
But yeah I take your point. I dont think it should be tradeable among players or allowed to be put in vendors but at a minimum they need to raise the scrip limit. Pretty much every player already has a bottleneck there when it comes to disposing of legendaries
---
Honestly! It would be a great change of pace for people who like playing hardcore survival games, which, if you listen to some old interviews and trailers, seemed to be the intended genre for this game.
---
Depends on your build
---
* For any PA build, get targeting HUD, so you can still track them when invisible.
---
* Shot-gunners with Enforcer can take them down quick.  First blast, aim for the legs, second black, aim for the head.
---
* Snipers - Aim for the head
---
Yes, he is just standing there all day anyway. We're doing his job.
---
Some (most?) of the problem is that the numbers don’t seem realistic; they’re hugely high for the non-Steel mats
---
Some of the problem is that the event isn’t very rewarding in terms of drops.
---
Some of the problem is that some of the event isn’t very rewarding in terms of completion; a beret and a banner, really? Extra dailies are nice, and that Collectron though.
---
Some of the problem is that the event isn’t well explained in game (I spent 20 minutes on the first Steel day looking for other containers to drop the other junk types into, thought they were all happening in parallel).
---
Some of the problem is that the event isn’t well signposted in game (maybe a radio broadcast every so often, or an immediate quest marker set to active at the event start would’ve helped draw people in)
---
Some of the problem is that the event isn’t well tracked in game; I shouldn’t have to find a website to see progress.
---
Some of the problem is that the event isn’t well signposted out of game - someone here told me where to find the *out of game* progress tracker site, or I wouldn’t have found it.
---
Some of the problem is that shuttling from camp to junk drops to bench to Atlas and back is slow (seen a lot of that loading screen), expensive, and dull. 
---
So we’re failing? Not surprised. The event needed a hook, some cleaner mechanics, and probably a bit more time in the oven working out achievable goals etc.
---
Because once again dupers
---
You can use mods at the moment too, on PC only a tho
---
I hope my girl plays with me in the future
---
Ya maybe I missed that part. I'll try again thanks.
---
I missed that part when I read it... So, according to Google, sovereign can mean "a supreme ruler," and rear can be used informally to mean "a person's buttocks."
---
With a little bit of rearranging, "rear sovereign teddy bear" could become "Teddy Bear: Supreme Ruler of the Human Buttocks."
---
Thanks, I hate the teddy bear now, and I'm going to shoot it with a mini nuke.
---
That is in the crops behind The General Steakhouse in the cranberry bog.
---
I understood your thinking, and you're probably right.
---
For me it is like I would hire a housekeeper and instead of cleaning up she makes even more mess but I should be thankful and pay her a double wage While she shits on my carpet and piss inside my fridge and I am unable to clean it up since she also don't let me use any kind of cleaning products (refere to modsupport).
---
Well I have no idea what I'm doing differently that removes money from being an issue for me.
---
&gt;So why the hell doesn’t he just go play Rust?
---
&gt;playing with a dead brain is attractive for some players without skill
---
He already answered that question though!  Probably gets absolutely destroyed on rust on a level playing field and wants to cheese/seal club with legacy/duped/noskill/auto targeting gear
---
I think they will sell plans for gold like the other factions.
---
As a BOS fan I'll be sad face if we don't unlock the banner. But that is an insane amount of concrete...
---
I just found the basement yesterday and it.s a real nice touch.
---
Well they do devolve over the years into raiding caravans just for a plasma pistol. [House's assessment of them just fits them so well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87US9AXNMME)
---
Takes 22 days to reach 30k caps if starting from zero and earning 1400 per day.  That’s without spending. So anyone with 30k on deck at all times, has a badass store where they are selling high volume legendaries or they literally have everything in the game already, and still you would need a player vendor set up to make caps easy to get. Don’t let this flex guy tell you how it is. I still have 4 serum recipes to buy and I will be on the level of “caps are worthless now”. 
---
But also you can’t just keep buying and selling all day in the vendor. Eventually the house will take all your caps due to the tariffs and taxes the bots take.
---
But remember who made the game? Bethesda. The same company who were such clowns that Internet Historian made a video about them. If you haven't already I suggest watching "The Fall Of 76". Video is more put together than anything Bethesda could shit out in a lifetime.
---
Look its the brother hood of steel. So the stripper pole is for robots. Darn technophiles and they're Fisto bots.
---
The workshop in the cranberry bog, abandoned bog town, has 3 concrete extraction pits.  There is normally a super mutant behemoth hanging around there, so players should be aware of that.
---
This sounds goddamn hilarious I want a video now
---
Cannibalism... does exist? It’s an endurance perk card
---
Yep. My camp is built along a lake and it's almost guaranteed every time I first log in or travel to it, I end up under the foundation unable to move. Gotta fast travel again to free myself.
---
I find her way of reporting too opinionated, and her presentation too robotic. Also she makes big deals about nothing. And her farming routes tutorial vids aren't really helpful nor the best way to farm/grind for said things. I like Juicehead for general news on the game and Bethesda, Angry Turtle for in depth analysis of perks and weapons, then i look at NoRespawns &amp; DTD Gamer for camp stuff, and Nightin gary for various things.
---
For the next event they should have us donate a million bottles of NukaCola to Julie. I would gladly help her since she keeps Appalachian Radio on the air. What has Russel done?
---
Never said anything about bashing them. My comment was to the OP saying (paraphrasing)....”I can’t imagine what the developers are having to go thru working from home”. There’s lots and lots of developers working remotely, different parts of the world even before covid that are able to get things done. It’s not a defendable position. 
---
Now if OP would have said, “I can’t believe what the developers are having to go thru maintaining the this antiquated pile of dung source code”.  I could sympathize.
---
I wonder when we will be out of early access, though
---
I use these with a bloatfly syringer. Bloatflies drop meat, glands, flux components, and about 1 in 35 is a legendary.
---
Shoot the assaultrons in the legs and watch them crawl around and take them out with no mercy.
---
Can't wait for the days and weeks that follow when people are screaming 'wheres my BOS Flag/Banner'.
---
Sorry folks, that's the Concrete truth of life in Appalacha, no donation no reward.
---
I found a guy who was selling one for 300 caps but i didnt buy it thinking it was bugged but do have the atomic shop version thats golden
---
I only keep two 100% fusion cores on me in case I need to use the power armor.  
---
Your (and others') tips do help though, I didn't know about the bandolier perk because I've not come across it yet.  
---
While we're on the subject of perks, I have another noob question for you guys:  
---
the way I thought the perk system works is that you have to select cards from the bottom list of cards for them to be active. But when I tried to build shittier pitchforks for the expensive shop, by disabling the craft-with-130%-lifetime card, I found I still craft them with a 130%. Is that a bug or is there something I'm not getting about the perks  system?
---
They're gonna cement their place in Appalachia
---
Anybody else found the corn growing out of the portable toilet behind that museum near raiders?
---
If thats the same place im thinking of with the nuka cola sign it also has a wood deposit. I Hate how I can build there seeing how its literally nothing. I'm thinking it might be a future workshop or possibly a scrapped workshop that they never removed
---
Yeah, just extending the nuke free zone a tiny bit would work. My camp is by Sutton station and it's barely nukable.
---
Haha yeah but to be fair that happens wayyyyyy later than where we are in fo76, and I would say that's probably the lowest of the low that the BoS has ever been depicted
---
Absolutely!!
---
Maybe also because the minimum ”donation” appears to be 250 concrete.  
---
I usually only have about 50 on hand.  Happened to be in the area with a bit over 100, talked to the guy, went to the bin....and it asked for 250.
---
Beggars can’t be choosers; he got nothing.
---
Out of curiosity, how do you make caps? Water sales? Players buying legendaries off of your vendor? I need to know, because I can't keep caps. I'm level 110 and have maybe 2k right now...
---
Will you share a link to your work?
---
This is sad, but true. And so far the tracker is still sitting at 4.65 million, which at this pace won't even come close to completion. Unless, like you mentioned, the person responsible for the data was on a weekend.
---
They always immediately forget about me when I do it and go fly somewhere else, and it's not like my sneak is any good as I only have 8 AGI, not a bloodied and not using Escape Artist...
---
I wonder if they based the amounts on Fallout 4, rather than Fallout 76's actuality. Concrete was much more common in 4 thanks to scrapping of settlements.
---
Either way it shows that the devs are really out of touch with the game.
---
And that dude becomes the new raid boss with his new giant concrete and cork battle mech
---
As a member of the BOS, I can with confidence say that all your donations are being put to a good use..... arts and crafts, today I molded A Giant Concrete Banana for Bethesda to sell in the Atom Shop... 1200 atoms, your welcome
---
But if you don't have a surmountable goal for your challenge you might as well be challenging your dog to drive to the store. This is a 4-day challenge. The first day was a weekend day and arguably the day that First players would have dumped the most into the quest, but we're not even at one thirtieth of the total needed. It's discouraging.
---
Pass, we already have an obscene amount of unfun and non-immersive garbage to manage (food/water/rads/weight/ammo/durabilities/camp maint.)  
---
&gt;Fallout fans are all over 30 years old mostly
---
That's a pretty bold claim, based on my friends list and friends of my friends it is a super diverse group ranging from 12-50+
---
&gt; I think we
---
I think you need to find a game that fits into your wishlist, like rust or ark, instead of turning existing games and flipping them 180 into something they have NEVER been.
---
Enclave Armor? You talking about the PA? That shit isn’t developed until 100 years later.
---
I think DayZ is better than rust, and theres some knock offs right around the corner that look really good too lol. They need to just nerf PVP completely in this game and figure out how to bring some updates to nuclear winter, supposedly the team that created nuclear winter got pulled to work on starfield, the coding is probably to difficult for the current dev team to figure out.
---
He does sometimes take stances when he is pretty pissed.
---
20 characters? Holy
---
If you watch the Inside the Vault articles, they will usually post about it when a Q&amp;A is gonna happen(seems they’re trying to have one before each major dlc drop now). Sometimes it’s just a sub everyone posts questions and some devs will respond back over reddit and other times, like this past one, it’s an interview between the devs and a community manager who’s fielding more popular questions.
---
its not a display casd tho. it functions the same as a keg or punch bowl. they'd have to code every kind of drink in the game to be shown inside it. and there's way more important things in the game to work on.
---
Most likely. He probably got salty when another player beat him when he tried to ambush them at a workshop, or got frustrated when he tried to start PvP with a random player that had Pacifist on and they just gave him the Heart symbol and ignore them.
---
Don't want a stripper pole, want a ball gag to shut them up.
---
Juicehead is a clickbaiting douchebag.
---
Sounds like a bug if u didn’t have the perk equipped. Also something that a lot don’t realise is when u take a point in say strength you don’t have to take the card is strength. Back out and u can select whatever card h want. Bandolier is a must if u use guns
---
maybe the people updating it took Sunday off?
---
Yeah that's what i like about him, it's just the news. But he also sometimes calls out Bethesda on broken promises and brings back old promises that are being broken. I don't need a Alex Jones type of reporter on Fo76
---
Fo76 is playable on any platform?
---
Doubt.
---
The best shotgun I've found is a quad double barrel (if ONLY I could find quad explosive double I'd be in heaven), so far.
---
The damage on a double barrel is pretty high and you can fire the quad one like a machine gun pulling the trigger as fast as you want - it can dump the 8 shells in seconds.
---
I have a 2 or3 (can't remember)star bloodied Grognak Ax in my vending machine
---
prolly not soon, but is coming, like in a year or two if that
---
Quite a while. In the beginning I just concentrated on obtaining any pieces with the sentinel modifier. Then slowly, through trading weapons and other pieces of armor managed to obtain the full set I wanted. 
---
I have no confidence in being able to do this with SS armor though. There is only a 5 percent chance of rolling an exact piece.  On the bright side, there is a 1:13 chance of rolling a piece that at least has the sentinel modifier.

[Volume 2 - DRAFT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycdM1KtyWdORGbEkspiaFF_mFHH1jSqvB6RNGUBsARo/edit?usp=sharing)
---
This is my draft work - trying to get as much material down as possible. It started as a handy user guide for myself and friends I was RP'ing with - but I got motivated and started building a real story.
---
Volume 1 is the first year (Reclamation) and Volume 2 is Wastelanders.
---
Enjoy.
---
was helping a guy defend Monongah Power Plant from Rad Scorpions. That took forever. We were running around not sneaking trying to get them to aggro to us. Finally found half of them were on the roof, but then when we tried to attack them, they instantly dove into the roof and ran away. Then we had to go hunt them down all over again.
---
I am of the belief they will cook the books
---
Honestly I'm just impressed that they even have the storage for this stuff.
---
Unless the BoS set up a scrap box at the observatory.
---
Maybe there is some trick that we haven’t found yet.
---
I run 15 agility pts as a bloodied w unyielding which pushes it over 30. Use escape artist as well.  I got no issues as I target the head. 
---
Maybe ure not hitting hard enough to agro?
---
Thanks, will look at it :-)
---
On public events it displays how long ago the event was started.
---
With this metric i can gauge roughly how much time is left before the event fails and despawns from the map. Its anything over 8 minutes ago i dont go to it.
---
But regular events Manhunt for example, doesnt have any way to see how much time is left or how long ago the event appeared on the map.
---
I agree. OH LOOK AT ME I CAN SHOOT A FUCKING LASER OUT OF MY FACE. Little bitch
---
They are dangerous, but I still hate floaters more.
---
Yup, did it yesterday with a SS Jetpack, a springboard trap, and just the right setup, no glitches
---
The concrete one is a steep climb considering on how reoccuring this resource is vs steel which is pretty much everywhere.
---
they always get down to like 5% health and then just fly away while I am reloading.
---
If you look at the whole game from release to now, I would say it has been some big changes in the stability tho it's far from where it should be
---
Reap what you sow. I carry 98 lb. of gear against a carry capacity of 230 without unyielding (which is somewhere around 340).
---
30 mins is the same as I do on the bike exercising - so it's difficult to do more unless I up exercise too - trying to match them.  Forget about Netflix and Amazon :)
---
Jesus, you talk to your mother with that mouth..... lol JK,   
---
Anyways, i haven't found that he's click bating much if you want to talk about clickbaiting and 18 videos on the same subject look at jjfloperz
---
So you start a private world.  Have your friends get to the fallout 76 main menu.  Then they should find you in the Xbox, not fallout, friends list and select join in game.  I think there is also a way to have voice chat through the Xbox friends list?
---
Yeah patch 20 definitely improved it, but with the last one it's a struggle. It will not stop me for playing tho
---
You need to have them running a considerable amount of time though just to make one or 2 donations. Cork doesnt even have that and thats next.
---
They really put no thought into how limited some of these resources are and greatly overestimated how much people had at hand or why theyd even gather it
---
I think both next gen consoles will be backwards compatible with older generation games. I know the Xbox is which I plan on getting. Just remember Sony doesnt allow external assets for modding so when mods drop for Fallout 76 thats the last place you'll want to be playing . The hard lesson all the Skater XL kids are currently learning right now.
---
The only saviour that can help us now is a duper who spend several hours dumping his duped junk.
---
boycott atlas
---
I donated 250 concrete. That's it, no more concrete.
---
Yes, my Tesla makes Rad Rumble and Uranium Fever unplayable 😞 I was even doing a West Tek run yesterday and using the Tesla started causing frame rate to drop and everything got pixel-y so I switched guns. It sucks cuz I love that gun
---
Thanks for replying :)
---
&gt; Also something that a lot don’t realise is when u take a point in say strength you don’t have to take the card is strength.  
---
I don't understand what you're saying, could you explain a bit more?
---
Don't forget up to 1k gold to start, from the quest.
---
You've got moxie, kid. I admire your optimism.
---
This is exactly what I am having aswell, I'm not having most of the issues my friend seems to have, but notably my legendary board is really laggy.. do you have your game installed on an external SSD?
---
One of the building in the abandoned bog town has like 10 bags in it and the monorail elevator has like 9, I think the generals steakhouse has 3-4
---
OK, thanks!
---
Hahahahahahahahahaha, I'm not paying for that.  No one is.  They'll shoehorn it into a bundle to add "value".
---
Wasteland scarry, want my comfortzone uwu.
---
It's not that. Steel is very easy to get, and people with First just store it. I had 50k steel within my characters, but only 3k concrete. And let's not talk about cork.
---
In fact, Steel is the only scrap I have above 5k.
---
Also, with the glitched line in the sand, you get around 3k per run easily.
---
It makes me laugh when i think about how people are still so naive that they think it matters how much they donate. The event will autocomplete. They don't spend money and resources developing these types of events and then say "Sorry, event failed, you didn't donate enough. We are just gonna throw out the content we made". Not once have i seen any of these types of events fail in any online game.
---
I think they are going to use it for score boards - How many uncooperative civilians have I killed today?
---
Bloodied can be quite tanky, especially the PA variant. Though the non pa variant will have a higher dmg ceiling because the highest dps weapons are unarmed at the moment and PA cant use them.
---
remember, the BoS themselves arent asking us for stuff, Russel is so he can build up Atlas for them and gain their favor. i think the more likely answer is Russel has no idea how many materials are actually required to do what he is doing and is WAY overestimating things. the BoS is gonna show up to a decent base and a crapload of materials they dont actually need.
---
Oh for sure.  But if it hadn't improved since release, especially considering the state of the game at release.  I guess it's up to you how much congratulations you want to give to them for simply doing their job.  Either way I don't think people should be rude towards the developers or bash them but it's not like they are performing well-beyond expectations or anything.
---
Because most of the community probably even doesnt know the event is even happening given it has had basically zero in game highlighting outside a tiny easy to miss square on the start menu
---
Don't forget a big X for the Nuke to target.
---
Most hated enemies? Assaultrons are tough but I dont hate them... Liberators on the other hand, those things are the the mechanical equivalent to wasps. F#ck those little azzholes. Nothing like minding your own buisness making way through the wasteland then a red beam burns a potmark on your ass from a nearby bush.
---
SAVE ME DUPERMAN..... 
---
So when u level up u get a point to put in strength perception etc. You then pick a perk card. The perk card doesn’t have to be in the same catagory as the special point u took. So you take a point in strength. U then get the strength perks available. Back out and u can choose a perk where u like.
---
They fixed it.
---
Thank you SO MUCH for looking into this.  I will give it a try and let you know how it went :)   YOU ROCK !!! &lt;3
---
FYI it is not been updated
---
they could have made it a daily SCORE quest. then they would be guaranteed 250 a day from most players.
---
See the notes to P21, that "glitch" has been fixed.
---
I think if they were gonna "cook the books", they wouldn't update the events counter to only show 4 million at this point in the event...
---
Well fuck lol /thread
---
Angry Turtle has done several tests.
---
Yeah, I guess it's kind of like monkey we monkey do. I've mean it is far from perfect but I'm not going to hate a game where I have so much fun and forget time and space and just live in it.
---
My last 3-4 fights I'll pop her with the plasma cannon a couple of times to get her attention then run east toward the cranberry bog. It has worked every time so far and she'll chase me down and land every time.
---
the main enclave is on an oil rig off tue california coast, and the members in appalachia are all dead thanks to MODUS. i dont see the Appalachian Enclsve as a true Enclave faction. more like "MODUS and his pre-war government assets".
---
1. They were added. They were removed long ago because players used them to trap people and steal their junk. 
---
2. The best solution would be the ability to designate a spawn point outside of your camp radius that faced inward to your camp, that had to be on stable ground.
---
The game had more bugs and crashed more than all games I played on PS4 and PS3 combined. After Wastelander I can't remember last time it crashed.
---
Or import/copy our current characters, but it'll definitely be a one-way trip.
---
True. That knocks off almost a week of grind.
---
Yeah. Ranting on cheaters and wrongdoings is being insecure. And what's this recent ban has to do with junks anyways? It didn't dupe any junks it was only for gears.
---
Might have if BGS did not piss everyone off !!! 😂🤣😂
---
I kinda wanted this banner since there's no flag. Too bad it's this difficult to collect even 250 concrete
---
I think it’s a mix of terrible rewards and pissed off people over patch 21.
---
I usually build away from the Nuke zone, at the minute my C.A.M.P is at Twin Lakes
---
It's gotten so boring that I hop around the map helping to defend claimed workbenches.  Of course being a level 375 I freak out the owner thinking maybe I am there to steal their claim.  There are only so many nukes you can drop in one day.
---
200,000,000 concrete is not easier than 2,000,000 screws. it's not even remotely arguable.
---
You can use them right now?  I don't want to risk my account or his.
---
Someone makes a decision you don't like so therefore they deserve to be fired?
---
Wait until the Plastic portion of the event. Concrete can be a Mother without a node or buying it - IF a vendor has it. My prediction for the Plastic will be about a 1/4 of what the concrete is now.
---
Except that some dick will go and booby trap the fuck out of the spawn point. I can practically guarantee half the camps will have a spawn point surrounded by like a thousand spike traps beneath and around it.
---
I can imagine this'll be something you'd have to pay for.
---
I want a scorchbeast lure at my camp. 
---
That would be effing awesome.
---
I'm just glad Cazadors aren't in the gama
---
How high a level have you gotten? Because up til 25 is fun because its all so fresh, 25-50 feels like a drag that'll never end and loose faith in the game, then 50 and upwards just becomes easier and easier.
---
I was that way for a long while. Had a legendary that I pot shot from a cliff overlooking the Top of the World while it crunched through Scorched in the Ski Resort. Took like over 200 .308 because of how far and how little dmg I did.
---
Fast forward to Friday, buddy of mine has a ninja build and I'm running bloodied commando. He takes the first swipe at one by the BBQ shack, barely moves the health. I take aim with a .308 light machine gun and he's down in under 50 rounds.
---
We were both like 'Wow, that was... Wow.'
---
Yeah, 4 accounts, 20 characters.
---
I'm a hoarder and normally in most MMOs I'm one of the top "auction house" dealers. I fucking hate limits on shit like money, scrip, and bullion. I wanted to be able to store up to 20k scrip and 500k+ caps at any given point.
---
“Polluting” means doing it in the area separate from most of the rest of the game, yes this makes sense. Get a grip.
---
How much money do you think the actual developers make?
---
I just wish there was text chat also. Not everyone talks. Emotes are OK but can't say on server hey come help me with this.like a good event pops up and no one does it because they never noticed. At the least more emotes but say words instead like thanks, help me, and different things like that.
---
I actually see your point I guess
---
However, I still feel like your home base that you build should grow in strength along with you, atm there isn't much of a power spike from a low level camp to a max level camp in dependability 
---
Why shouldn't your base be able to grow as badass as your character becomes?
---
I only started the game a couple of weeks ago, and I'm usually the loot everything type. Even now, I only have just over 250 concrete. There's simply not enough available in the game to meet that goal. It's ridiculous. Even veterans in the game don't seem to have near that much...
---
When they join via xbox friends list, it tells them that they need to be friends with the host in order to join. 
---
How do I get a refund lmao
---
If you’re one of the contesting parties (owner or attacker) it completely overrides your pacifist setting. If you want to play with pacifist on but still attack and defend workshops, you can do that.
---
I should rly read those, thx. Just recently i put it into a few of his perk sets after patch 20. And it worked. Had it for those few weeks only. Im sad lol
---
Ok. I'm working on a 2nd character who is 34.  
---
Shotgun non-PA build.  
---
The short range of of shotguns isn't like my main Sniper.  
---
I know that a Laser weapon can be made into a shotgun or am I wrong?  
---
If you know how to mod a laser weapon into a shotgun I would LOVE to know. I don't have my shotgun build done to link but I can get it if needed.
---
It makes me laugh when i think about how people are still so naive that they think it matters how much they donate. The event will autocomplete. They don't spend money and resources developing these types of events and then say "Sorry, event failed, you didn't donate enough. We are just gonna throw out the content and rewards we worked on for weeks". Not once have i seen any of these types of events fail in any online game. The number you see on the page means absolutely nothing.
---
Well i don't know, we've done 4.65 of the 150 million concrete, so yeah that's not gonna happen.  Pretty sure cork will get even less! I would say the last one on alpha could get done, but i dont think as many people will give it up.  I reckon the wood, cloth and glass on bravo might get done.
---
This should be fun. Bethesda can now either give out the rewards anyway, or be very strict and say we didn't reach the goal.
---
Either way, they look like a joke. Again.
---
I have no idea what Armor Ace means, but I like what it sounds like. I wonder if there's any datamines of the game board, or any SCORE rewards that aren't on the current season.
---
I miss Survival Mode so much. There are a lot of players out there that do want a harsher map to play on, and the lack of difficulty options has kinda turn this game stagnant for me. I'm glad the majority of players find enjoyment in their farm mode (Adventure Mode) but this game has such potential to provide a true difficult survival experience.
---
Have you tried collaborating virtually? Not every company is set up to do it effectively. Just because you work on a computer doesn’t mean working from home has zero effect on output.
---
Recreating this should be a Daily.
---
Hahahahah
---
Bethesda announced in an interview that support for mods was still in the works a few days ago... (hmmm... several years past original release date) but that is probably referring to PC. As for consoles, that would be a battle between Sony/Micro'crap' and Bethesda. It took forever to get mods for FO4, due to Sony restrictions and not Bethesda.
---
They were in the game. From my understanding, it was easy to trap players so Beth took it out of the game
---
Was this bug introduced in patch 21? I've never had this problem up until now, and it happens almost every time I try to fast travel. Although I have only just started using a bloodied build with low HP/high rads, and some people seem to think its related?
---
Quoi?
---
Not the hero we need, but the one we deserve
---
This is my theory about how the Collectron will play out.
---
Contact me too (Lamorak\_2000). If you'll return the favour, I'll guard your stuff for a few minutes as needed.
---
You can farm concrete at Bogtown. 3 spots, no waiting :)
---
They had it in originally, but too many were setting up trap bases. I never ran into one but that's what dev claims.
---
Oh damn. I didn't know that. Thanks a LOT!
---
Because campbudget and stupid ai turrets.
---
I was pretty excited the first time I tried it too..
---
And I was thinking about playing fallout76 on my pipboy while i have to sit through *another* boring ass Enclave presentation.
---
You need to find it before it finds you. Get the stealth hits in as quickly as you can. Watch for it's head turning red and get yourself in a spot where it can't laser you to death. You want to try to get as many hits in before it turns itself invisible. Also remember that robots tend to be armored more heavily in the head so aim for the chest. 
---
The Chinese Stealth Suit is your friend in this situation. It'll help you quickly get those hits in.
---
Laser weapons can't be made into shotguns. Unfortunately none of the mods for laser weapons that you would think might reclassify them as shotguns work that way.
---
It will miraculously jump. If the event fails Bethesda will not only look bad for setting such unreasonable goals to begin with, it will also show them just what the community at large thinks of their event &amp; the lack of interest &amp; number of players participating. The rewards are crap &amp; not worth the effort.
---
Okay
---
I bet there will be a sudden donation at the last minute by bethesda. I mean an unnamed user! Yes an unnamed hero of the wastes
---
doesn't work with alcohols, good to know, thanks
---
Yea but what if better turrets
---
ah the old 'helen keller' prank...move the furniture as a surprise. Got it. I fall for it EVERY. TIME.
---
Get some sleep Todd.
---
I could care less for downvoted. Two favorite pastimes, looking up from my camp watching people try to find the entrance, which has an arrow and direction added, and also to hear everyone say how awesome it is to see the world from a new perspective. 
---
My camps will be underground so long as I can keep shoving them into the earth, downvoted be damned.
---
I'm just a little bit over 50, so your conclusions are spot on. :)
---
In my experience, if you build in the southeastern corner of the map, the scorchbeast lure mechanic is already implemented lmao
---
if you know a place on the map where I can set down a resource gathering device so that I can farm screws please fill me in. there are several places where you can put a resource gatherer to farm concrete scraps. There are gnomes to be had in abundance, bags of concrete lead pipes. while screws do come in several different items they come one two maybe three screws at a time when I can make 60 concrete scraps an hour in a single production module and I can have seven of them going at various resource points I'm starting to make a good deal of concrete. Not enough to meet the 200 million goal but I would meet that goal faster than if I was trying to gather 2 million screws. Just think if you've been around awhile how many screws do you have?
---
I always aim for the head and melt it with my heavy weapons, I don't care about how speedy it is I just don't want to be melted through a wall
---
Welcome. And. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Use this to plan your build/perks
---
Just making sure you are aware there is a BOS expansion coming later this year, which will assuredly have lots of BOS content.
---
I can neither confirm nor deny this.. :)
---
Ah, I confused inception with progression. I thought you were complaining about a probable grind loop.
---
This is very well appreciated information for a flux farming addict. Have a perfectly preserved pie on me.
---
Teddy bears
---
I already play on mobile sometimes
---
Still doesn't change the fact they are not working and shooting the collectron, grahm or another turret instead of real enemy's.
---
That sounds intriguing!  Maybe military themed items?
---
(And a clean toilet)
---
.44 pistols have very high base dmg which makes them ammo efficient. With a scope they also have excellent range and accuracy and serve quite well in the sniping roll.
---
Nah it’s for the devs ears so they can continue ignoring all the requests and reports of bugs and issues.
---
I've done that several times. But right now I'm way happy with my camp in the mire and the two I have in the savage divide. 
---
I wanna duck hunt scorchbeasts in the mire.
---
Tbf. That was after 1 day. It isn’t been updated. 
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if we failed this one though.
---
Mine haven't done that since like two patches ago :/
---
Either way, yea that's my point tho, they should make turrets better and also actually work
---
Y'know, considering we have space suits, recreating that meme wouldn't be hard.
---
Pretty much this. Donate 1 time to “get your name on the list” and be done with it.
---
I'm level 366 and im grinding. Outfits and plan so you can see when they said you be able to get rare plans from the drops I was really excited. Not that, that lasted long.
---
Fetchez la vache!!
---
ya, can't have them until Beth figures out how they can't be used for evil.
---
Its scorch beasts for me since I don't have much range on my weapons, but because I'm a power armour based build I can survive assaultron blasts with lots of health to spare
---
So I haven’t gone mad yet! I thought I’d just noticed it there for the first time, but worried that I was being a fool and it’d been there the whole time.
---
Thank you!
---
Maybe they just wanna cap the fissure sites.
---
Use the mousewheel while v.a.t.s.
---
Better find a dog to tame so it can laugh at you when you miss
---
My client stability has absolutely tanked since P21 went live.
---
Good to know I'm not giving out crappy advice.
---
&gt; Yea? Let's see what happens xD
---
"We are officially shutting down the Fallout 76 public servers. Private servers will still be available. Thank you for playing."
---
That would be ideal. Good call.
---
I literally got smacked by one yesterday.  On my way up to grab the concrete bags.  Saw some super mutants and though easy XP. The super mutants provided enough noise to mask his footsteps, then donk!   I had to laugh at the fact I didn't see him coming.
---
Seems the answer for everything nowadays.
---
But I see hundreds of duped weapons in circulation and no stopping the trades...
---
Ha ha, ill keep doing it as it seams to work for me .....😂😂
---
*Laughs in Minutemen artillery blowing up the Prydwen*
---
I only used it once to test it out, but sadly my budget doesn't allow it.
---
A friend of mine has a fancy enclave underground bunker next to a silo hatch, seeing the nuclear rocket from a platform about 30m away.
---
I think dataminers can’t figure out which datamine belong to the next Season or ATX
---
All things marked as ATX unfortunately
---
If only there was an option to fast travel away... or leave the game if trapped.
---
Poor rewards = poor participation
---
A lot depends on the enemy.  I’m a non-bloodied melee.  I tend to use heavies on things that fly - to  support that, I have stabilized3 and a couple of automatic perks in the PER column.
---
One of my newer toys is a zealots focused gatling plasma. Prior to that, I had a vampire 50.  Fro my perticular load out, when fighting SBs, the plasma does About 2x the damage of the 50.
---
Tried the plasma on L62 ghouls - took a lot more plasma hits to take one down - the 50 cal works better against them. (but both pale in comparison to my switchblades)
---
Sorry but I love those sexy things.  I want one for my camp.  My most hated enemy is MOLE RATS because you can't run from them and they can burrow from the parking lot to the second floor of a building and I'm sorry but that's bullshit.
---
There was a hotfix last week for Carelton Mine which was broken with the update.
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
I was the workshop owner during the fight (though it was in the middle of or directly after the workshop defense event, if it matters any to the ownership status), so I will just accept my suck and be more careful next time, haha.
---
Tank commander mode: engaged
---
Go play Ark or Rust. 
---
While I miss Survival Mode as well, it was pulled partly due to the lack of interest by the community. 
---
There’s a reason multiple types of games exist; because not every game appeals to every player. 
---
Find the ones that appeal to you and play them. Leave the ones that don’t appeal to you (but appeal to other people) alone.
---
Just see Jeff reply
---
I dream of the day my wife plays with me, but she doesn't like it. If your wife is new to the fallout series, I recommend a stealth vast build, I am using it and enjoying it a lot
---
BE gatling gun is still tops for me. I have a BE 50 cal, a BFFR 50 cal, a BFFR UGL, BE gatling laser, and the rest of the usual god roll suspects, and BE gatling is what I use the most by FAR. Some of the others haven't been touched in months. In the gatling's favor are no spinup, easy on ammo, low fire rate but sweet LORD that damage, and surprisingly accurate with decent range. It's less useful for SBQ but I have other guns for that.
---
If you're definitely interested in a heavy weapon, rather than rolling the dice with Mole Mama, get some modules and craft the gauss minigun until you get one you like. At least that way you're guaranteed a heavy gun and all you're gambling on is prefixes. I have a B33 gauss mini that, even without the magic damage, is a monster.
---
Did 2 bulk steel donations in one instance and saw the "rewards" was alcohol and crap floater grenades. No plans or anything of value to attract me again. Wasn't worth my time for absolute junk! Fool me once, shame on you... fool me twice, shame on me!
---
I always have SB meat hotkeyed. With carnivore and strange in numbers, it's ridiculous the buffs you can get.
---
What a wholesome thread. This is the kind of quality content that I’m here for 💛💙
---
you *know* I'll be trying it now too :)
---
"If you do not agree..."
---
MOOOOOOO!
---
This just more proof that more people support the ENCLAVE!
---
BoS can go suck my toes.
---
Ok and thats another option, raise scrip limit...

HSSSSS

\*UGN\*
---
HSSSS
---
\*AHH\*
---
\*URGH\*
---
Me either!  I bet when it does update though, id be surprised if it's gone above 10 million. Steel, wood, plastic, cloth and glass you can get hold of pretty easily if you know where to look, but concrete and cork is a really bad joke at best!
---
&gt; for 
---
Damn that sounds rough.  I know FO4 took way too long considering previous Bethesda titles thrived off mods.  I still play Skyrim every now and then with well over 200 mods active just to expand my gameplay even more.
---
I hope they don't take too long to implement this much wanted (not needed) addition to 76, it would be pretty incredible.
---
600 from NQs, how much are you getting from SB meat?
---
Let's be real, probably nobody at Bethesda actually plays this game.
---
When you're at an event make sure it's selected as active in you Pip-Boy. That'll put instructions in the upper right corner of the screen. Follow them. And accept beforehand that you'll screw up on occasion, we all do. You'll get the hang of it before too long.
---
This is better than most of the stuff in the patch notes. I would have included it. xD
---
Personally I'm newish also but what I do is as soon as I unlock events I do those untill 20s-30s. Once I get some cards, and gear I start doing more of the story. I'm now level 65 and can do just about everything in the game easily except the queen fight. You will figure stuff out as you go.
---
Overclocked cpu? If yes, problem found.
---

You can still craft the scrap box in your camp, get components out, but not put anything in. And, thanks to the last update, the scrap in the scrap box is used after your character's scrap and the scrap in your stash instead of absolute last after autoscrapping your junk items.
---
How do you even know how many concretes there are? I donated 7k in total I thought there’s like big rewards for them. I’m regretting this big time
---
Never heard the giggle, but the Gnome over at Sutton Station on the table turns around as you ran past it
---
AFAIK that’s the whole list. Modules/Vault steel items, bulks, and alcohol. I wish it worked on alcohol but I totally see how broken it could be on the others. My rad ant lager “addiction” enables the hoarder in me.
---
&gt;  4.65 million out of 150 million needed and it ends tomorrow. 
---
**TOMORROW**
---
I mean you literally get steel from just about every weapon or armor you can scrap.  You literally can't get concrete from scraping ANYTHING other than bags of concrete.  
---
What did they expect?
---
The brother hood are going to drop by to collect the materials and then have a melt down at the players for there not being enough of the materials for their overinflated requests
---
Honestly do what you like at events, I've seen high level players screw them up for their own pleasure so don't worry if you make mistakes. Just have fun. 
---
The onscreen instructions should be clear enough to follow and if you fail it will come around again at regular intervals for a 2nd, 3rd, 3 billionth try.
---

---
I think the issue is less the issue of low FPS, but you managed to not go insane running radiation rumble four times in a day.
---
Hope it works for you .....got me a beautiful b3325 caster yesterday .....
---
whoops autocorrect i meant  carcass Lol thanks
---
Its easier solo.
---
Troublshooters weapons help a lot. AA as a second choice. Much higher dmg against the bots, thus much lower ammo consumption.
---
Yes, I agree, certainly they will release future items with the new content.  The Enclave will get love too.  I would like to display the banner and have the collectron once the event ends either "earning" them or if not the option to pay.  Just like they have done for the Legendary Run recently.
---
I noticed some people farming concrete but in the field i found only a couple of gnomes... So i gave up i buyed cork in bulk so I hope not to be stuck with it .:. O Superdupers were are thou ?!!
---
Same here.  Ran a One Violent Night and someone was using a energy weapon.  Piles everywhere, framerate was 1 - 2 FPS.  As soon as I got out of the building it went back to normal.  Go back in, 1 - 2 again.  Ended up missing a 3\* ghoul and then the douche with the energy weapon went in the back and solo'd the windingo while the other three of us were flailing our hands.   Fail all around.

---
I'ma gonna tell the BOS to gather their own damn junk.
---
Just Bethesda. BOS is pretty damn controversial, with maybe more people hating them than loving, so it'd make sense that you shouldn't be forced to welcome them with open arms. You are not ofc, but you can't stand up against them, or enjoy the content either.
---
Btw they could've made it so much better. They couldve even decided how the West Virginia lore continues based on how we decide things by community events.
---
I cannot wait to try this haha it should be quite the experience!
---
Greatest comment ever!
---
The point is to make you log in daily for as long as they can reasonably stretch it out. Logging in daily increases the chance that you’ll spend atoms on new items in the shop. Keeping daily log in numbers high shows the parent entertainment company that the game is still viable and deserving of future support.
---
Not a math expert, but seems like we're behind.
---
Thanks again!
---
Try moving your camp unit to the opposite side.
---
Nah Colonel Gutsy is the worst
---
I saw it lol
---
I don't remember the next line, but related...in 11th grade I blanked on a French exam for the verb for "to get / retrieve" so I slid "fetchez" in there...it was an essay portion and figured it might be overlooked. 
---
I get it back with a big red circle around it, with "more studying, less Monty Python" written in the margin.
---
Yeah, definitely telling a story lol
---
Why didn’t you make a new character with her? My wife and I played together last summer to level 50 then started a new character each this summer to level 95
---
I have a ticket in for this as well on steam platform. No response yet, put it in just yesterday.
---
IRC, there is a sacrificial blade mod for the cultist /sword/
---
Not sure if theres anything for the dagger, though.
---
All the games on Xbox game pass will be able to be streamed to any device, mainly your mobile. Fallout 76 and ESO are on Xbox game pass
---
I just found some gnomes and went like nope nope nope im not jumping 10 servers for 250 concrete...
---
Welcome. What system you on?
---
Go for the legs, Boo, go for the legs. Or the Thruster, in case of a gutsy...
---
What about a Bow/melee hybrid
---
Every now and then I will get a Legnedary sale. Though ammo is more common.  Honestly it is just a lot of looting and selling as well as events, dailies and what not.  I also don't buy a whole lot preferring to craft everything I have besides legendary gear which I never pay more then 1k caps for.
---
Assaultron are imo good and challenging enemies.
---
They are dangerous but not too tanky, the opposite of scorchbeasts, which not that dangerous end game and a general nuisance to kill.
---
Also dominators that can cloak to counter VATS cheese
---
RemindMe! 2 days
---
Idk what level you are but at my current fairly low level (38) I managed to get a troubleshooters combat knife and that has made them a breeze. Granted I am a melee build but I assume that perk on any weapon will work to the same effect.
---
One of the first census violence events i ever did was a hoard of gutsy's...it uhhh...didnt end well : /
---
I'd rather see Duchess and that dump truck of an ass.  ;)
---
Assaultrons aren't bullet sponges, so if you get on them ASAP you can take them out before they go full kamehameha on you.  Otherwise use cover to hide until they recharge.
---
\*Laughs in Enforcer shotgun\*
---
Oh really? Too bad there is NOTHING in game notifying us of our progress?? I mean honestly if we aren’t glued to this sub how would we know we need to donate anything? There isn’t even an event or anything telling us to go to the observatory. The brotherhood broadcast has been in the pip boy ever since the paladin taggerty quest Line
---
Nope, nothing was overclocked.  
---
And temperature of cpu/gpu is normal:  
---
up to 40 Celsius, while just using the browser  
---
up to 70-75 while playing fo76 on ultra settings, fps depends 90-120+  
---
And again - I started to face this few weeks ago, before that I never faced freeze issues and nothing has changed in my pc specs (just replaced the second monitor and yes, just in case I've tried to turn it off, disable, use previous one :)) )
---
That would be a great solution, if they don't want to add text at least give us emotes with words like "thanks" or "low ammo", "brb" things like that
---
 $83,739 according to Google :)
---
I play from work on my 10inch tablet using rainway to stream from my home pc. Even with a bad WiFi at work I managed to stream stable and have acceptable quality.
---
No problems with lags, framerates or input. Only thing is the app don't accept the select button of my xbox one gamepad via Bluetooth, but I can easily use the on screen overlay to change 1st/3rd person view or enter/ leave camp building mode.
---
Haha. Nice try though!
---
I already spent too much time with the settlers to turn my back now
---
I doubt i would join them unless the rewards are good. If not, screw em i'm going to join someone else
---
Dont forget the scorchbeasts If your low on ammo or melee. Best learn to run away and pick fights
---
I die a lot but I’m a bloodied build
---
Dont forget to harvest that sweet SWEET sb meat...you down a couple of those and its pretty much an unyeilding set bonus for an hour (even more with carnivore)...mmmmmm delicious
---
I recommend investing in this thing called a life, you clearly need one.
---
*Thank you for paying.
---
I would absolutely love to donate Nuka Cola to Julie. Any kind of quest for her would be awesome...maybe she could even have special rewards or something too
---
They wouldn't even need to make a model for her, just have a broadcast station and have her talk from inside
---
Part of it may alos be for the buy/sell from 3 players  daily challenge.  
---
I’m more inclined to buy cheap stuff I don’t need than expensive stuff I don’t need/already have.
---
I suspect that they're planning on a bonus community event once they arrive for anything we didn't unlock legitimately. They've already made the assets, might as well find a way to give them out.
---
How did you have 3k steel without FO1st? Thats impressive. Is that like the only thing in your stash?
---
I would actually laugh if they go back to Fort Defiamce instead XD
---
Well, I'll pay atoms for both.  Just make it like the Legendary Run, either "earn" them or buy them.  Problem solved for people who really want the CAMP items. Like me.
---
Ya my build 1 shots legendaries other than major boss mobs. Some mad people the first time I realized this. From then on I just run up and bash them and wait for everyone to tag the enemy.
---
Gotcha. Apparently it’s only android. Never heard of this. Thanks.
---
Um in the “arrival announcement” repeating message from the incoming paladin, she outright states that they are coming to secure ATLAS, that any resistance will be met with deadly force, and that they *expect to have mats waiting for them when they arrive*. 
---
So, they don’t know that Russell is doing this specifically, but they sure as hell expect us to run around like goddamned serfs, collecting supplies for them for when they arrive. That sounds a lot more like the F4, Manson-led racist techno-raiders we know.
---
#NukeATLAS
---
Bloodied. Two-shot isn’t that great.
---
Trap camps are not Trapping you, they are Killing you. And FT usually won't help. 
---
And to make it worse have you seen the state of Fast Travel? You might already have limited time to check you surroundings and decide its not safe, and you want to FT...the first 2 might take a couple of seconds, the latter is a random number of tries.
---
TS is one of the worst prefixes in game, while bloodied is the best of the best.
---
that is a lot of flamingos. Why does the BoS think that America has turned communist after we got nuked by them? we don't share our stuff for the better good in America. Get you own junk. work your ass off for it, and deal with the grind and arbitrary caps and limits that we have to deal with.
---
I just want to know why a Flatwoods Monster I killed had a spatula....
---
It will probably have a bunch more ghillie suits rewards. As I don't think we got enough yet.
---
On top of the great advice you are being given Id also add hover over the events on the map. The ones with the ! in the icon are public ones that have a server wide alert theyre starting and will give a recommended level to participate. 
---
(One to be wary of is Guided Meditation which is labelled as "easy". It isnt unless you are kitted out to take on lvl 60+ charred ghoul mobs.)
---
So I’ll try to get all my weapons bloodied thxs just wanted to know which was which appreciate it!
---
I’m confused. Why couldn’t you just go in the front door of defiance?
---
Also, this sounds like a bug. I’m surprised fog crawlers would ever spawn there.
---
Bloodied, if you play with lower health.  You can get up to +90 or 95% extra damage. 
---
Two Shot if you play with full health.  It adds about 25% IIRC.
---
A light-up stripper pole you say. Imagine the settler forager up there shaking for some caps😳
---
More to the point why did I retrieve ionised meat from the trio I killed in my last Nike Zone? I smell DALEKS!
---
I was being a little facetious. The point is the devs don’t get paid extra for pushing atoms.
---
legendary perk card: fast travel on first try, 60% of the time
---
Dupers ate the only ones that could reach these crazy goals.  There are not as many dupers as most would think and why would they donate, when they can sell it for real money on ebay.
---
Yes,  I've had FO 1st since day 1.  I've never had much leftover concrete just laying around.  You don't need that much unless you move your CAMP consistently.  I had no issues with Steel.  I just don't have any concrete.  Nothing drops concrete, you have to go out and actively look for it.  Don't get me started on cork too.
---
It happened to me a couple days ago. I deleted part of the floor by mistake, I tried to put it back and was red, fisrt "intersected existing object" then floating. I made my camp from cero again, and then some of my decor "need support" in the same spot has always been 😒 a total pita
---
I feel like I have gotten a few of these. I scrip all melees cuz seems like no one buys them so 😬
---
People used eyebots as bottle openers?
---
so he is Nestlé? what is next, making 3rd world countries work in slave labor and claiming their only water supply and then reselling it back to the locals?
---
Even on a private server over at bog town, the 3 extractors don't kick out enough concrete to make a dent. And cork will be even more difficult to gather.   
---
Bethesda this not well thought out. Not in the slightest.  Concrete, cork, and plastic are some of the hardest materials to come by. You need to seriously adjust the amounts required to meet this challenge.
---
I think if your gonna release a nuke cola machine you gotta at least be able to display Nuka colas. Operate it like a display case - drinks show when you put them in,. Disappear when you take them out. 
---
Oh well 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Same thing goes for mole rats and other animals. How and where was the mole rat hiding that 10mm pistol... on second thought I dont wanna know lol
---
Go for the legs!!!
---
Concrete makes sense realistically. Wood, steel, concrete are pretty much all youd need to make a bigass fort. Just...why so friggin much?
---
This. We will be juuuuuuust fine.
---
&gt;we need to rely on dupers and hackers to get us through this and next milestone
---
glorious game design
---
Is this bug related to bloodied builds at all? Played since beta on Xbox until Wastelanders when I switched to PC and I've never had it. Coincidentally, I've also never used a bloodied build either.
---
There are dozens of little environmental hazards a creative person could use to murder visitors. I have severely radioactive water near my base at Hemlock Holes that could easily kill a 19% HP bloodied build not in power armor or hazmat suit. You could place it on the tightrope across the ravine near Foundation. Or on an unmarked fissure site (there are several of these). Or the various fire hazards in the Ash Heap. Or the top of a large tree in the Mire. Or on top of an angry deathclaw/yao-guai/etc.
---
Floaters when they spam you and are high level. Just ridiculous.
---
TS is really only useful for Area of Effect weapons - Grenade Launchers, Fatman. Accuracy is nerfed way to low to be capable of matching even a base single shot weapon unless you are very, very lucky.
---
He's still gotta cook, can't be a monster without protein
---
Maybe they're like those small, coin-operated rides for children and you have to put a coin in an eyebot to make it work?
---
I joined the event clicking on the map icon. It was supposed to be north of WS, but sent the fog crawlers inside fort defiance in the part that you can only get with the elevator I guess and I spawned inside the elevator. 
---
So I fast traveled back to the entrance and couldnt reach the crawlers at all, entering normally and making my way up, that part was inaccesible.
---
Ah man. I had one that was 3 stars. I would of sold it to you had you made this post at the time I had it but it's long gone now.
---
hey /u/Robopop789 I just want to say, I would totally give you a hug right now if it wasn't for the pandemic. thank you for this list. now I can see what outfits I have and what I don't have (jumpsuits for sure) as well as see which outfits that I have are actually rare.
---
It is something one should not wish on another person, to most individuals having a paying vocation is paramount to ones personal stability in life, barring, god forbid, a horrible work enviroment.
---
Thank you for the kind words
---
Seems like they are just trying to get people that duplicated tons of materials to dump them out for the event.
---
I accept that the lack of a counter in game is a technical limitation of multiple servers and multiple platforms. I think that they needed to seriously reevaluate the numbers though. Other than steel, figure out what your realistic average player count is and assume that everyone will donate between 1000-1500 and make that the goal. Some will give more, some won't participate, but your numbers will feel realistic.
---
Plot twist: the flatwoodsmonster is a magpie
---
I checked my cork stash while I was looking and I don’t remember the number but it was not high. At least some workshops produce concrete. Where the hell do you get concrete
---
Aside from the other stuff people mentioned the second shot only adds 25% if it actually hits the target. There was a time when two shot was the absolutely best primary affix (because both shots did 100%) but this was from a time long past. Two shot is "the sux0rz" now.
---
If anything this should of been for the settlers and raiders on rotating weeks.
---
(Un)Ironically ive seen alot more people using auto tesla rifles...not sure if their doing it on purpose or not but the game gets bugged out real quick with just one dude spamming it. 2-3 ash piles and the event is toasted. Avoiding the area helps but...its pretty bad
---
Thank you for this! Lots of false theories about V9 and tents restricting SBQ from landing. It's got everything to do with the stagger perks one has, and firing at her while she is hovering (you know the move when she is about to shoot straight up in the air and then land really hard). Causing a stagger right before her "landing move", stops her each and every time. At one SBQ fight, players started to fire at an individual that kept firing at her just as she was about to land but kept stopping her. As soon as he stopped, she circled around again and landed! (You know you are playing with high level game veterans when everything goes silent and no one is shooting her, waiting on her to land! 😁)
---
Why would I go insane? Unless you mean from plebs not knowing/caring how to run the event lol. I enjoy the event even just killing the ghouls for xp is more fun than the millionth golf club run. I’m also still trying to get the rad barrel plan but between the ridiculous drop rate and then no one running the event correctly it seems almost out of reach for me.
---
Well, maybe. I feel like a happy marriage, an incredibly successful business that I own and operate, and very fulfilling friendships is a good life for me. Maybe your idea is different, but I'm happy with mine.
---
Thank you for your concern, though.
---
Do elaborate.
---
They were in game and of course a few ass hats ruined for everyone by using them to trap people and steal there junk
---
Find me someone, who likes it,  also, anyone who actually plays the game knows how rare concrete and cork is, and if the people who chose the number actually played, they would make it much lower
---
For me... it was a leveling / gear thing.
---
My problem was leveling up, it seemed like if an assaultron surprised me, they could kill me before I even knew what was going on.
---
Now, they surprise me, eat 25% of my health while I hit a stimpack and line of sight them (to kill the laser beam).  And not really a concern.
---
Had some buddies help me out
---
I see well yeah I’m just getting opinions but now I’m definitely have all my weapons bloodied for sure
---
They don't deserve to lose their job and all the personal termoil that comes with it
---
Bloodied. But only if u have the build. If u have bloodied with vanguard armour running around at full health in PA. it’s not gonna make a blind bit of difference
---
Yes I do have it installed on a 1tb external SSD . Could that really be the difference?
---
&gt; Lower/mid-range levels will not know about it. Atlas is out of the way and has no real quest unless you count the ally one.
---
Playing on steam - I actually found out about it first on here.  My second account does use the bethesda launcher, but hadn't paid attention to it.
---
I play everyday but I feel like I’m so out of the loop with the gold bullion and junk deposits! Is this a mission in the game cause it doesn’t appear on my pipboy?? I did the final mission to break into the gold reserve and well that was it! Where do I find this
---
Thats sounds much better to be fair
---
Where in the heck even is Atlas?
---
I'm pretty sure we can't fail the event, so I'm not totally sure it matters that much. Bethesda is going to look really stupid and be embarrassed if we come up 100 million short of our goal. They really don't have any incentive to be honest here. Options:
---
* Lie and say we just barely made it at the 0 hour. Give everyone a free thing, everyone goes home happy
---
* Be honest and say we missed it. Nobody gets a free thing, the community is upset, it's clearly Beth's fault for the stupid goal in the first place, etc, etc. Bethesda looks like an idiot in this scenario.
---
Maybe they'll be honest, but I really can't fathom why you wouldn't just lie. _Maybe_ an employee leaks that it was rigged, _maybe_, but... would it really matter?
---
Kings because they’re tanky AF and don’t drop anything useful when they die.
---
They aren't get a scrap of concrete from me. As someone who donated 300k steel. The rewards have to be worth something
---
76 was frustrating starting out for the first time.    
---
I made so many mistakes with my first character that I deleted it earlier this year. My new main is level 100 as of yesterday.

Yeah maybe they don’t, it was just an exaggeration, but I was pretty upset especially after the shitstorm that was patch 21
---
Thank you for posting this, super helpful! :)
---
He does something he enjoys, and doesn't hurt anybody. I think he has a pretty happy life.
---
This glitch is how people where able to complete the legendary run in the first few days. But from what I here alot of those people got a perma ban
---
Equally as likely is in the rush for xp people are starting them immediately rather than waiting. They are there to cull the enemies rather than successfully complete for the end reward as often they have excess treasury notes already, so waiting for company who will reduce your farming is counter productive. Literally kill-jump-kill-jump...
---
My guess is only one lunatic duplicated those (no reason to duplicate) items. And we are all just waiting on them to log in and finish this. But Bethesda probably banned him and don't know, or care.
---
Honestly, with businesses and stuff opening back up, a lot of us have less time to wander around for hours gathering stuff for this event.
---
to be fair, NCR more so wants to make "You, Them" then "expend and consume", like the Legion, and then they actually backs up their words with helping and supporting the people as well.
---
Yes!!! Get her attention, stop firing at her and pretend to be the proverbial "sacrifice goat" on the ground. She'll land each and every time!!!
---
It has faster loading times than the built in HDD the xbox has, so that would be it, my friend has the game on the internal xbox storage, so that would make it a loading issue not as much as a network issue, maybe something bethesda should look into
---
But here’s another question would it be good with explosive bullets?
---
The numbers should be lower sure or we could donate in whatever quantities we choose. Oh I'll just put in 100 now and I have 50 left over from CAMP building, I'll donate that
---
True i never thought of that, I spend too much time on private servers powering up power plants I only go on to adventure ones for the scorch beast queen event and to visit other player vendors i need to visit adventure servers more.
---
The only event I can think of you can screw up for someone is Encryptid - just don't activate the terminal if you are not the person who used the (expensive) recall card. 
---
I consider it common courtesy for some events to wait a bit for other people to arrive before I activate it (pushing a button, using a terminal, approaching the trigger...) but thats just me.
---
I thought it was just me.
---
Yep. They probably looked at the amount currently stored in player accounts before coming up with that number. It’s not a lack of resources available. It’s a lack of incentives to get people to give up the resources.
---
I'm not even keen to revisit it. Waste my time.

If you're using mods from nexus, I'd say you're pretty much safe.  
---
Me and according to mod stats on nexus tons of other people are using visual mods(e.g. they affect only your game experience).  
---
Also, as mentioned - beth is planning for official mod support
---
When she decides to hover, I'm more than happy to light her up, because she's not going to land at that point. Otherwise, it's better to just let him do her thing.
---
Because sometimes a wooden spoon isn't the best utensil.
---
Fucking Mirelurk Kings going *glrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr* from an inch away, while spazzing out and somehow vibrating back and forth in 45 degree arc, while also being completely unhittable, has to be the main reason I'm not playing right now.

As a melee build I just couldn't take it any more lol

Junk extractors produce screws in addition to other junk. Whenever I check my extractor there’s usually around 3 screws.

Or they magically pop-up from underneath a floating platform.

I've got a blueprint for workshops which is a foundation, stairs leading up, then a second floor with 4 turrets, another set of stairs and then another floor piece with those low walls. My workshop got attacked by molerats, one of them managed to tunnel through the air and emerge from the top floor, mound of dirt and everything.

My best weapon for RR is a FSS ghoul slayers switchblade - 2-3 hits, Ghoul is dead).  Going toe-to-toe with as many as are at RR, and knowing how hard they hit back,  I don‘t have time to be nice and call out legendaries - I’d be dead Before anyone else could aim.
---
   As others said, UF is a different story.  Tag with a mid power SMG, make the call.
---
If the rewards are good I'll just buy to tier 100 like I did yesterday
---
Horde events suffer from a series of bugs - from location problems to leveling issues.
---
I also really want the camp items, what’s so different is that instead of throwing these items to the shop, they’re making an alternative way of acquisition, community challenges, problem is, the cork and concrete goals they’ve set are like paying 2000 atoms for something like a C.A.M.P. Decoration, it makes no sense and it’s wildly off the mark
---
To be honest, you don't want to learn *anything* from Anthem other than how **not** to run a live service game.
---
Bloodied Heavy. You can easily swap between perks as they generally use the same section.
---
It's not an automatic counter.  I'm pretty sure someone updates it manually.
---
Magical bloodied shotgun? iirc the shotgn perks are in STR, right?
---
ah I dont have them right now, thank you for the offer though.

Each spot makes 33 Concrete an hour, from what I found.  So 7 spots at 33 per hour is 231 per hour or 5544 a day.  At 5544 a day it would take 1 person 27,057 days, or 74 years to produce 150,000,000 Concrete.
---
To do it in 4 days it would take 6765 people running all of the sites 24 hours a day.
---
So there is that.
---
I personally dont play to grind the perfect set of SS armor, I play to do events or pvp. So I’m totally fine with a full Unyielding scout or assassin leather set, cause armor is something I get to go with my build.
---
Just like I traded up for my bloodied weapons I would trade for SS Armor pieces to log in and play events for fun not just cause I must in order to complete armor. Imho
---
I'd say you can easily use gatling gun/laser/plasma and .50 cal, just by switching your melee perks to heavy guns (all of them are in strength)
---
Help me shamless dupers, you're my only hope.
---
Get a fixer with 20% more damage to robots troubleshooter I think it is, kills it in seconds
---
Yes. You can swap in shotgun or heavy gun perks easily as they are also under STR.
---
"I get it they're people but they also love money"  
---
I can pretty much guarantee you that the actual people working on the game (the ones in the intro video, real people, with lives, that also like this game and others) don't "love money" as you put it. That is a top-level executive thing. Anyone at any software company can tell you the people working on the product have little or no knowledge or interest in the financials, that is entirely at the executive/investor/holder levels. They may be mandated to do or not-do certain things for financial reasons but they have no dog in that fight.
---
You should try using bloodied explosive 50vats damaguns or faster fireRate guns this is good for handmade fixers levers and lasers.
---
Ive been using vats and a shotgun because for some reason lately my shotguns have been able two shot high level enemies accept scorch beasts only in vats so i am using the fancy pump or my tse pump
---
If there was a stash box near atlas, i MIGHT drop some off, but i wasted most of my concrete trying to rebuild my base so i don't have a lot.
---
They only thing I'm going to donate after donating 10k steel will be the wood cause what am I Gunna do with it
---
Yes I agree, i was pretty upset yesterday when I found out and yeah they shouldn’t be fired. But I’m pretty upset considering my camp pet disappeared and the game kept crashing right at the end of events so they wouldn’t count. But someone needs to be held responsible, right?
---
Good, for me only beret is kind of cool, the rest is worthless, I'm not going to donate even scrap of cement, cork or plastic.
---
I think the only one you can really screw up for other players in encryptid.  If you get there and the quest objective is to use a terminal, do not touch it.  Let the person who started the event decide when to use the   terminal.
---
No. More sad on the number of bugs. I have lost count of how many legendaries that i cant loot after killing them...
---
It’ll probably be in Tuesday’s atom shop update. That seems to be the best guess right now.
---
I can’t be bothered with this pointless event. Besides I will never use and if the rewards anyways
---
Assaultrons and mirelurks kings are why Jesus invented landmines.
---
Fix? Autocomplete? Still reports of it failing, just browse by new.
---
I also have FO1st but I tend to move/change my camp every couple weeks and I only had about 275 concrete. I'm not going to go out and grind for concrete just to get a box full of useless alcohol
---
Oh okay thanks I was wondering if all this is for nothing. I don’t think we will get the cork or the concrete ones
---
I don't use that one and still have this problem.
---
And some of us only play during updates and actual events. I’m not downloading a 15 gig update file just to farm concrete, I’ll come back when something worth playing again gets added.
---
I‘m pretty new too and done the quest line leading to the event without knowing what tf that is. I heart of the event on YT and after googleling the quest bc I don’t get that you needed to craft this card. Thanks got I search it up before activating xD
---
I know that at least one of the reasons they cited was a combination of home responsibilities (you now have kids in your house instead of at a daycare) and things like bandwidth (developers needing to upload builds that are 60-70gbs in size). I've been working from home since March and while it's all "on the computer" there are definitely unique circumstances that sometimes affect the ability to get things done.
---
Pretty sure it only updates at reset.
---
Even more embarrassing. I had it happen once since the patch but it was only visual and went back to normal shortly after. Too bad that others are still affected if it wasn't just visual for them.
---
He won me over. The burn was so bad, I had to laugh.
---
I’m just saying, if we are giving them 145 million or however much is being asked for, of each of these materials the botherhood better build the biggest fucking fortress ever seen.....
---
Look out for a Gatling Gun. With the fast receiver and sights it can deal good damage at medium ranges, and it's accurate enough in one shot mode to make a decent sniper. I currently have a 1* Bloodied and it works very well in general play, and it's sustained fire is great against mobs or larger enemies. If only I could get my hands on a 2/3* Fast Firing version.
---
The sound they make immediately makes me think of absoute idiocy, and rage.
---
Idiocy because they sound and look like dipshits.
---
Rage, because that damn " *glrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr* " noise brings up a bunch of flashbacks of one of those bastards spinning on the top of my soon-to-be-corpse after one-shotting me in my inventory.
---
Check the sub
---
No problem here... completed event numerous times and on PS4. But get lags on the Legendary Run board.
---
Same.
---
From what I know, the location of your C.A.M.P (not like on the map, but where you actually put the little machine) effects where you spawn. Try moving it around and fast traveling to your camp, it should change as you move it. I had this same issue and was able to fix it by placing my C.A.M.P elsewhere.
---
The fact itself that progress can't be seen/tracked in-game is ridiculous at best and outright shady at worst.
---
"Most of us wont build"
---
....
---
Speak for youself actually. We BoS Fans are waiting for BoS Camp items since release. I really want that Banner, and I dont see Bethesda keeping it unobtainable for everyone when the milestone isnt reached.
---
I predict that the milestone will be unlock anyway or they make it unlockable through Atom Shop or as a Weekly Rewards down the line or something along those lines.
---
In the time that you've made three screws how many concrete scrap of been made? It's not to belittle anyone it's so people take a step back and look at unrealistic goals that Bethesda has made on this event.
---
we could have chose another extremely hard to find item like ballistic fiber or fiber optics and then throwing a multi-million count of what we needed to donate. The point that is trying to be made is that some items are much easier to procure that others.
---
I dont farm flux and don't really farm mobs inside the zone so no point
---
the steel was easy, I use that for lots of things. I'm not gonna scrounge around for concrete (which is heavy BTW).

---
I started with secret service under armor and the top lining for same.
---
Been an issue since FO4. They'll never fix it.
---
Get some armor dude, berserker and bloodied are 2 different things.
---
I do hope that if the collection goals aren't met the new Brotherhood compound looks like half finished shit LOL like a level 10's camp in the forest.
---
Steel is easy. Do uranium fever and loot every body, equip scrapper perk and scrap it all and you get over 500 steel in 10mins from that one event
---
I've had it visually almost daily, and my score seems to add at random instead of when I complete it. Before their "fix" I lost 3 days at 2x score. Super shit. Like nearly 10k score.
---
I do honestly believe them when they said they didn't realize the change they made would affect camp builds. I believe that these people play the game but that not everyone is playing as hardcore as the people here (or that they even do the same things, like build a lot of camps). I don't think anyone noticed this change in the PTS either.
---
It hasn’t been updated for two days FYI. 
---
We will still probably fail it. But your photo and post together are a little misleading.
---
amen to the crippling assaultron legs. Once they are crawling to you on the floor, they are a lot less dangerous.
---
I dont care if the event fail. it shows that the devs dont even play their own game,,also i have a gut feeling that this event is designed to empty junkboxes so that people will resub to FO 1st, anyway there are guides like  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqv3xZoxhZY) if you want to farm around 400 concrete.
---
See you  in 74 years then.
---
I'll happily give her all my 40mm grenade rounds, mini nukes and missiles.
---
It's a spit in the face to see a chance to recover at least some SCORE be put behind an obviously unobtainable goal.
---
Most iconic reply i have ever seen today 😂😂😂
---
So it’s your fault j/k
---
I’ve got FO1st as well, and I’ve only been playing about 2 weeks but I’m level 170ish. I have less than 250 concrete total. Like i can’t even contribute what little I have.
---
700 concrete and 2,000 cork here, and I tend to clean out whole buildings when I go a scrappin'
---
Ah that explains it . Thanks mate.
---
I burn through (pun intended) my gunpowder very quickly, definitely not unusual for me to have to craft more using cloth and acid.
---
Weird conspiracy theory when the collectron is going to be pretty easy to get. I don’t know who is too excited about a flag pole.
---
Steel is easy to acquire on the fly. One uranium Fever and scrap all your loot with Scrapper perk probably yields one donations worth of steel if not more. Most junk items yield some steel. Doesnt take much effort to get 3k steel in the days that ran because it has plentiful sources in game. Concrete and Cork? Yeah not so much
---
Another new-ish player here, and everything has been pretty straight forward. Few things I found useful:
---
1.  Find the quest icon on your map and make it the only active quest so it’s easier to find the objective.
---
2. Join a team (or create your own and choose Event as its type) — you will gain more xp, and make it easier to help (and be helped) by other players if they are participating
---
3. You will often see legendary enemies during the event, try to get one shot in and use the call over emote so everyone else get the chance to attack it before it dies. This would allow everyone who damaged it to loot the legendary!
---
4. Equip perks that would be helpful (e.g. if you’re fighting bunch of bugs, equip perks that will negate their armor)
---
Good luck!
---
Not my fault Bethesda couldn't update or automate it. Blame them for misleading us. Once again. I'm just highlighting information provided by them.
---
Your shoe laces need them
---
Nope, they knew the place and they gave us instructions to build and deposit junk via a Radio broadcasting
---
IMHO, Marsupial, Healing factor, speed demon, and Adrenaline.
---
Classfreak2 starched genes2
---
Floaters are freaking annoying
---
The observatory will be upgraded regardless our effort and BoS will be in Appalachia too - we just won't get the community rewards without fulfilling the goals.
---
Yes! Miss "Electric Sex" bot is the reason why my jaws clinch in regards to silo runs...
---
That's what I thought he said too.  Makes more sense than armor ace.
---
People are dickheads. That is all.
---
I was playing in a team the other day with someone and the insult bot came up to us and I was so happy...apparently my teammate was not and killed the poor bot. I was so upset, why would anyone kill him!?
---
it's not a mission, it's a community thing and it's at the ATLAS Observatory, in the middle of the map and a little to the right.
---
Dude, take a deep breath. You didn’t notice the number has not changed since Saturday?
---
I took a tasteful picture of it for my loading screen. I've often considered submitting it for one of the contests just to see what the response is.
---
There was literally 0% chance it finished. I was never giving my concrete away, let alone my steel or cork.
---
Plot twist: it's all sci-fi rewards with alien blaster skins and recolored invader skins.
---
I wear the green asylum dress with my blue beehive hairdo to look like Marge Simpson. I’m looking for the green belted dress, tho, anyone know what it’s called?
---
Sure it's rare-ish but the innate value is placed on it solely on people's *perspective* value.
---
If someone never wants to use a rifle then it's worthless, if someone desperately wants a quad explosive one to drop then it's worth the 10k.
---
Me for instance, I wouldn't give 2 spoiled meat for a bloodied weapon because I can't stand that cancer.
---
In this case though, *lying* would be the right thing to do, in a weird way. I think we can agree that those numbers are WAYYYY too high. If they give it for free with something like an apology, it would be both morally right and make the player base happy
---
No there aren’t. There are people who thought the check marks added to the UI meant they were completed. Bug has been fixed.
---
My theory is they're setting th see numbers aimed at people who mass-duplicated resources to pull them out of the game.
---
Ik man I offered it for 7k after and he said that’s a ripoff
---
You would get around 20 concrete in that time. I agree that it’s easier to farm concrete with extractors.
---
I had to use a lot more parts to patch that mess that occurred, as I had to enlarge the building, and now my budget is 100% full. I will have to delete some decor or furniture if I want to put anything in the cooler.
---
I'll build the banner. I actually only want this and the BoS collectron
---
It sounds like a military theme. But i think we had enough military stuff in this season with all the ghillies. I would rather see something else something unique like summer themed stuff like beachwear or whatever.
---
Heavy gunner? Yeah I'm keeping my heavy gunner character in exile till the legendary perks come out so I can make more ultracite ammo. My commando doesn't need expensive ammo so is self sufficient without crafting ammo.
---
He should give you a weapon case quest every day. I've found that in my game, I actually have to talk to him, he won't bring it up to me. Idk if it's supposed to be like that or not.
---
I'm on Xbox as well, message me your user name and I'll add you :)
---
They should put a un-killable BOS npc that walks around 1 hit killing everyone. The only dialogue it would have is "150 million concrete" as punishment for not reaching the goal.
---
It is your fault for this pointless post, though. We can all agree on that.
---
Same I prefer junkies or stalkers
---
Your ammo has a weight you notice ? My armour saw to that a long time ago
---
To be honest, I think this event will *crater* pretty hard.
---
Unlike Bethesda, I do not have any responsibility to check the tracker daily to make sure it provides updated information. The information provided states 4M as of today.
---
Make sure you rock that pride flag so I know where to drop a nuke.
---
Right on. Power Armor and heavy guns are how I like to play so that's mostly what I use.
---
Ok. You also don’t want to own when you made a mistake in your post lol. The tracker is not updated in real time.
---
Hey, the banner is at least something with a BOS emblem on it.  I've had my BOS outpost created for over a year now with no banner, flag, sign, or any wall decoration to display my allegiance to the cause.
---
I was told it is manually updated. So that's probably why?
---
🤷
---
No offense, but this seems a brilliant strategy.  High 5? (Borat)
---
The only thing I’m saving for is the purveyor sale and even that is meh. None of these rewards are worth emptying the stash on
---
Just get a Bloodied Double-barrel w/ limb damage, it'll be your best range weapon.
---
No mistake in my post. This is the latest up to date information given to us by the source.
---
I’ve only been playing this game for the past 3 weeks but I believe I’m getting close to finishing the main story line where I will have access to launching a nuke. My first target is Atlas Tower.
---
(X) Doubt

---
My guy, I get I made a claim and didn't source it, but you need to check before you speak. They didnt fix it. This was 3 days ago, there are still multiple "isolated" incidents. Just like the last 3 patches for "fixes" to the dalies.
---
Following the quest line you get one free card to use (after that it's 2.5K caps and flux), unfortunatley the whole line does not prepare you for the final showdown - new players often enough 'waste' their card because they have no idea what they are up against. 
---
Bad quest design, imho (besides people not able to read and follow the friggin instructions on screen). Still, the quest line itself is quite amusing/interesting.
---
Idk.... I dont scam people but have 3 fixer plans for 9,999 in my vendor. People will 100% pay it, and if people will pay 10k caps, that's its value.
---
If you have seen it for 1k caps buy it. You can sell it for a nice profit
---
Yeah, concrete is very scarce compared to steel or the likes.
---
Replace the word "men" with any other group of people in that last part and people would lose their minds.   But it's okay to say because it's men.
---
If I wasn’t having to constantly rebuild my concrete barriers and large walls protecting my fusion generator from pistol wielding sniper mutants, I might have had some to spare.
---
u/namirarots
---
Honestly, with no in-game banner, and no marker on Atlas on the map, my wife and I would have had no idea the event was even going on.  We only donated because I saw it on this sub.
---
I hate them. It doesn't seem to matter the level, if they get off that face beam it can melt you instantly.
---
Sure you can cheese them to death via stealth but even that doesn't make them "fun".
---
u/snazzaberry

Now kith
---
And kith
---
Your post implies we only got 5m in 3 days. That’s not true. It’s misleading, and it sounds like it was unintentional. Either you intentionally are misleading people or made a mistake. Everybody makes mistakes. It’s not a big deal.
---
Wait isnt my understanding that people dont want anymore grind mechanics?.....
---
This is the only test i saw:
---
https://youtu.be/h6khP-eAyCo
---
But i beleive he has the sneak perk card equiped. One of the commenters said they did their own test and it appears sneak caps at 90% ,the same way the weight reduction perks work. Each harder to detect peice gives approx 20% sneak. So 1 peice and rank 3 sneak card caps you out, and this is reflected on the test. I need to mess with this myself to confirm this. This would be ideal for me since i run handguns and dont equip the sneak perk anyways. 
---
Angry tutrle does great videos but he is human and isnt perfect. Number and formulas would provide a much better answer than wiggling back and forth infront of a turret.
---
I swear Mad Dog and his gang escaped every 15 minutes though this weekend on every server I joined.  Hate that event but it takes 30 seconds to complete.
---
All those soot flowers, blackberries, mutfruit trees etc you walk by and probably completely ignore....
---
bot vendors buy the fruit/flowers for 1 cap Each.
---
Inside whitesprings, all those vases, telephones, clipboards, soap, plus whatever is in each trashcan...
---
&gt;You could always find a new one mmediately after a previous one ended.  And often 2 might be going at once. 
---
Two public events at once has only ever been possible when one of the two was Encryptid or Scorched Earth, i.e. they are started by player action. And I've had one public event starting as soon as the previous one ended as recently as this weekend.
---
That said, yes, over the last months I've also with increasing frequency found myself on servers were absolutely no server-scheduled public event was going on for more than half an hour and sometimes longer, and barely any normal events were spawning as well.
---
Yes, you can find boxed mods in the game but they're quite rare. Plans for those mods for t45, t51b and t60 were only obtainable from dev-room, not available in the game legit way.
---
I agree with you but this guy or girl idk came up to me shooting at me so we could pvp but since I don’t pvp I trade requested him and then he started getting pissed because I wouldn’t sell my plan for 500 caps
---
How about a children of atom or mothman cult season pass?
---
But does it have an overhead for voice?
---
I have a meeting today where I am discussing this again with the team, I will keep you updated on where we are at!
---
At least he is at a place i can find him. I still got the glitch where i just need to talk to him to get my quest started. N talk to him again to have it ended. Saved me from doing the task.
---
I made an alt that is 2hand weapons and i can just 2 shot them but turrets are a killer for me now... they are like stairs and im the claptrap....
---
And how do you know that post isn’t just mistaken by the check marks?
---
Thank you for the tag! I have a meeting today where I will be discussing this again with the team. I'll keep you updated on where we are at!
---
Scorchbeasts are never really a problem for me, their damage output is low enough that you can usually spam stims and run away even if you are a low health build. They can be annoying to escape but it could be worse
---
And missing heads ghouls
---
I've recently begun collecting teddy bear scenes for my loading screen. So far I've got: 
---
Teddy bear execution in the warehouse behind mama dolce's.
---
Teddy bear campsite pyre. (I forget where this is)
---
Teddy bear cannibalism at restaurant in Toxic Dried Lakebed.
---
Teddy bear butt repair/proctology on top of the bank north of Whitesprings.
---
Haha. I’m sure some people want it. I’m just saying I don’t here a lot of people losing muy sleep over it.

---
Better given my resources to rebuild Responder and Fire breather.
---
or the soldiers guy in military camp.
---
I might farm my resources for them.
---
My post highlights latest available information on the event. Once there is a change I'll be happy to update. For now, this is what Bethesda provided.
---
That's scummy for sure. Shouldn't get mouthy at someone that you sent an unsolicited message to. Missed the start said "offer?"
---
Either he's trying to get something for nothing or just absolutely clueless about what it is. 7k is a damn good deal.
---
Let's keep stttreeeccchhhinnng there. What's more believable. Bethesda actually fixed their code, or they made a mistake seeing the check mark? Regardless again, that was 1 post, just search my guy, maybe even check beth forums.
---
IIRC, Gatling has longer range and better accuracy.
---
You went 170 levels in two weeks?
---
Ya but when things like the ammo converter are released as they are you cant blame anyone else other than the people who designed it, programmed it, and "tested it". People make mistakes and when we mess up we should be criticized its how we improve. Could you imagine the state the game would be in if the community just let bethesda do what they wanted without any backlash/critsism. Also you dont need knowledge in software development to understand when something in a game is fucky. You dont need a fireman to tell you your house isnt supposed to be on fire.
---
My favourite is “cannot place item in water” WHAT WATER?!
---
Yeah the quest was pretty good. Thanks god I was a little bit stupid and search it up. I would totally wasted that card
---
I sell everything in the white spring, never thought about the soot flowers and such though.
---
Why not just ignore the moron? Discussion with someone like that is pointless...
---
So how would I use a laser weapon for a shotgun build?  
---
That seems to make them pointless for this char and it can't do more damage to enemies who are weak against them but have good defense against ballistic weapons. WTF.
---
It made me feel so much less nervous when I did that. I hated the idea of PvP in this game.
---
lol meant 2 months. Played during double exp
---
If you give the thumbs up and heart emoji that would suffice
---
New maps and different game modes would be a lot of fun.  But they don't even get adventure mode patches right.  I just don't really see it happening unfortunately.
---
No keen to waste my time over these miserable rewards. Pun intended. Even the SCORE is turning me off
---
I don't really enjoy the experience...it tends to become whomever is higher level with all the right perks and gets lucky with the weapons wins. It only takes 1-2 shots most times and you're done.
---
I'd like to see a faction war mode. Take a larger section of map, allow players to represent one of two factions...allow building, maybe even bump it up to 30 players a side then introduce a couple of different modes...survival (last player standing wins for their team), objective (capture the different high tech objectives for your team- hold all objectives for 60s to win the game), capture the flag.
---
The last two modes could even have set time limits and allow respawns. I'd also up the amount of hitpoints everyone has so you can actually get into a fight with someone...maybe use cover more instead of a frantic spray to get the first couple of hits to kill the enemy.
---
I think this would be more my style - I used to (in the long ago time) play a lot of battlefield 2142 and I think a fallout version of something like that could be a blast.
---
It hasn't been updated since the first day, so it's def well above what it's showing. They'll be "working on it internally" to make sure it doesn't fail. It will likely jump up pat 100mil today. Just for the sake of perspective, it would take 260,000 servers full of world spawn concrete to complete it(577 per server is what I've been reading). Cork is beyond ridiculous. I'm sure what they did was look at how much scrap was out there and figure out a percentage. But much of that is stacks on duper accounts, many of which got banned likely after they figured out the number. Trillions of scrap is sitting on dead accounts. On top of that, those that didn't get banned aren't willing to give up their goods simply out of spite....lol
---
I think it's more nobody has concrete like that. I've been playing for four months and I had 228 in my stash. I scrounged up the rest to make the donation but that's it.
---
The Raider quest line directly leads into them, and they in turn lead directly into the Brotherhood.
---
Also, there's actually no canon confirmation that Raleigh Clay nor Abigail Singh are dead. It's very likely that at least Raleigh will return at some point.
---
After that point my squadmates and I were cracking up so it made our night a little bit more fun
---
Sorry we wanted to discuss something new but due to some issues we're going to have to delay it.
---
You're thinking the "Contractor" perk. You can effectively double the concrete foundation since it reduces 50% building cost for any C.A.M.P or Workshop building at full rank.
---
hmmm I was thinking about heading into Appalachia as a vault dweller than later becomes a brotherhood of steel initiate that goes about scavenging supplies and technologies, becoming addicted to stealth boys as I use it more and more and begins to stop travelers as I proceed to take... I mean confiscate their stealth boys, willingly and if not, I get the nukes and bomb them from appalachia.
---
Fixed it for me:
---
[I usually use up my Gunpowder pretty quickly, I use .308 which isn't super common, and I use an FFR LMG, so I use it up super quickly. I always buy some whenever I see it in a player vending machine and the last 2 weeks I have found several thousand in player vendors. Plus unlocking the Armco Ammunition machine, the Raider Collectron gathering ammo, and the Ammo Exchange helped a little. I currently have 4000 and on a good day I will hopefully only use 2000. I craft it constantly and am always worried about how much acid I have on hand.  My gunpowder storage never fills up.](https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127507/6455858-8250149545-1so58.jpg)

The "goal" is way way way to high for what'sin the game and how much you need to save for projects.  Where do you get concrete, from scraping guns nope, armor nope, fans nope, tin cans nope, typewriters nope, extractors NOPE.  You really only get it from 2 things really, bags of concrete and gnomes.
---
Finally looking through the rewards announced so far, I'm just confused. 
---
It's garbage?
---
Lol no chance I'm giving my scrap to a bunch of armored clowns calling themselves knights
---
Let’s dispose of Russell the Appalachian way. The mothman craves sacrifice.
---
Unfortunately, no luck this year, maybe next year with Spring season
---
You can't get formula p this way , but you can get the rest
---
Mirelurk Kings.  What's wrong with you?  I'd rather go up against a squad of Deathclaws or Gutsys than just one of those stupid things.
---
Ik plus he sold me a preserved pie for 250 so I was willing to give him/her a good deal
---
What appeals to you about 1st? If it's the private servers and/or the scrap box yes it's worth it.
---
And it's not even considered canon so it doesn't make no difference
---
I can do one better. I ran into a really weird bug the other day out in the bog. As I was running up on a bunker I hadn't uncovered on my map yet, I saw a Col. Gutsy. Since I was on my medic and his stealth skill is shit (high str/cha), I charged in and swung on him. Only to get an assaultron laser to tge face.
---
Let that one sink in. A Colonel Gutsey, with an Assaultron Laser. 
---
Whiskey
---
Tango
---
Mike
---
Foxtrot
---
I think a dev would have to provide confirmation as to all the factors involved in stealth.  In my mind, I don’t understand why anyone would run a stealth build without the sneak and escape artist perks, but I’m also human.
---
It would only take about 483,333,334 caps to just buy the Bulk concrete for 145 million concrete scrap. What's 483 millionish caps amoung friends.
---
They don't deserve our money, but I did it for one month. Stuff your scrapbox to the gills and you won't worry about junk ever again!
---
Ok Todd.
---
Was stealth build with rifleman/max barbarian/max Ironclad load out using Chinese Stealth armor w/armor mod to backpack. Never even used PA for silo runs. Then switched to Commando for better SBQ results. Handmade and Fixer. Great results. Just now switched to Junkie build to try something new at Level 190+.
---
very true
---
Woooh almost there guys
---
Probably gotta wait till November.
---
Can't say I'd be surprised.
---
**Thank you for preying
---
LOL.  My raider character would agree with you.  Plenty of CAMP items and a growing list of more raider items on the way, from data-mines.  BOS and Enclave have been waiting for awhile now.  Would be nice to have the wait be over and at least one wall or floor CAMP item to display.
---
You can actually get both on the same set
---
Motion assist servos on the torso for +2 STR, and calibrated shocks for the legs (+50 carry per leg).
---
It isn’t about them ‘deserving’ your money. 
---
It’s completely about if you think the money you’re spending will be equal or less than the amount of enjoyment you’ll get out of it.
---
For me, I am completely into the game. I love it. Warts and all.
---
So it’s very much money well spent in my life.
---
You are correct but that’s serious low balling even people who don’t trade would be shocked
---
Not enough bandwidth for voice, only data.
---
I’m not FO1st. I have about 20 pounds spare scrap box space I continually work with. I usually never have more that 1 bulk cork and zero concrete on me ever.
---
I kinda like the scrap box , But will i ever use it ?
---
My concrete was lacking so I held Abandoned Bog Town for a day to get some, but given the current progress the end result is just a lot of dead super mutants. I think cork will be the same. 
---
I usually hoard steel, springs, screws, adhesive, aluminum, adhesive and fiberglass for the constant repair of weapons and armor. Cloth shouldn't be a problem, I am always picking up pre-war money to make gunpowder.
---
What *is* the canon ending of Fallout 4? I get the feeling it’s wiping out the Institute and the BoS, while sparing the Railroad as the General of the Minutemen.
---
Judging by the steep drop off in these posts after each challenge update daily, I would actually say the former.
---
I just checked it and while not real time it shows 4.5 million. There's NO way it'll be done.    
---
Whoever set the numbers is an idiot.    
---
I don't find the tire flag thing bad. I was in the military and the beret is a standard part of the uniform. By participating in helping the BoS you are effectively part of it so getting one makes sense. I got one in BCT so it being the first reward also makes sense.    
---
I'm more disappointed in the rewards for Seasons than the BoS.
---
Why are there pipe weapons in pre-war safes?
---
Why are there cap stashes in pre-war buildings?
---
Why are there scorched robots?
---
Why are there diseased robots?
---
Why does every feral ghoul have chems on them? (are all ghouls former junkies)
---
Inquiring minds want to know
---
Too bussy with legendary run, need to get those higher SCOREs 🤗
---
Almost reminds me of Silkroad. The game that was so grindy it was almost expected and was fully accepted to use a bot to level.
---
It seems useful but yet again I’m conflicted on spending money on this game
---
What platform you on?
---
You made a mistake. It’s ok. They have not yet updated the number. You know it. Everyone knows it. Let’s end the conversation here.
---
I must admit I gave loads of steel &amp; found the "reward crates" to be filled with unwanted dead weight
---
Considering there's nothing you get off enemies that you can scrap that produces concrete, what did they expect?    
---
But I'm amused that at least we now know that the challenges aren't fixed to succeed.
---
With Cork? Fat chance of that. I really need that bonus SCORE, but unless they severely lower how much we have to donate, it's not possible.
---
Xbox
---
Absolutely I only had about 4000 concrete in my scrap box at the start &amp; I'm a gannet
---
When I first load in from fresh its slooooooow. I understand the camp taking a few seconds but I have to avoid using any benches, or the fast pick wheel for a minute or more - basically anything that takes you out of your default view will either be blank (like map quests take time to show) or grind me to a near halt (jump on a bench, realise my error B to cancel... B, B, B... BBBBBBBBB). I've had the 'no weapon' occur too.
---
Aah, joy. Probably because if it admitted it took 30s+ to fully load people would moan so instead bodged it and hopes you only want limited 'run &amp; jump' functionality until it settles down.
---
It takes guts to say no to shitty challenges.
---
Are you a new player? 
---
Is your character less than level — I dunno, 50? 
---
Then just wait longer to decide.
---
it's not well thought out at all
---
Like I get it dude, I love this game too, a steady daily player, tell others to play regularly. You don't need Todd's disc in your drive though. They're still buggy, much less so than before, but they still auto complete.
---
If you still have the plan, hold if for me. I'll give 7 for it.
---
I don't even keep more than 100 concrete on me at all times because of the god damn limit stash limit. And no, I'm not going to spend 15 bucks per month for something that should be in the base game.
---
How TF do you manage 20 characters and yet have time for all that?
---
Are 19 of them simply mules? Even then, to have the time to collect all that shit...
---
The Brotherhood stole my last functioning calculator, so I'm not super inclined to help them set up shop in exchange for some alcohol I'm not going to drink. I got a few plans from donating steel, but I think I'd rather sell my junk in bulk to the Appalachian vendors.
---
Buy local, support local businesses, dwellers.
---
Lol noob
---
4 accounts 12 characters and 300k steel donated between them. And yeah the dead was just meh. I could do supply runs and get the same thing
---
I've played...well...more than that...and I've only ever seen two- a suppressors and an anti-armour.
---
If you want to take crap though - I got tons...this weekend alone I rolled 2 more 3\* shovels, 1 3\* iron pipe, 1 3\* pipe wrench, 1 3\* pool cue AND  a 3\* rolling pin. My current record is 15 shovels of varying stars...I kept the 3\* ones for my wall of shame however.
---
The RNG in this game is both painful AND spiteful.
---
Right? Not to mention the bandolier perks. Most of my ballistic ammo registers as a weight of 0. I have several thousand on me at all times.
---
The value of something is determined by what buyers are willing to pay for it. If you're not willing to pay what people who actually buy them are willing to pay, then you're not a buyer.
---
If you never want a Fixer to drop for you, there would be no reason at all to buy the plan because it would just dilute your loot pool. You might miss that medics death tambo you've been after.
---
I don’t think any of the devs play this game for fun, it’s a chore and they’re rushing QA because they can’t be arsed
---
Escape artist is a necessity i will say that,  but without the sneak perk, 20+ agility and this armor youd be very suprised how stealthy it is. Dont have problems standing right on top of super muties aslong as my weapon is supressed.
---
I've been ported to taggerty's room with a legendary yao guai wandering around the pool table. And this was before I had done the glasses cavern, so I was trapped in there and had to fast travel to get out.
---
I am far from new , I’ve been playing since beta and still haven’t spend a penny on this game , Just wondering if first is worth the cost
---
I hardly see scorch beasts
---
You’ve got to realise T-60 armour is one of the endgame items. Trading is fair game, but giving it away for free (which will then be exploited by dupers) will just make the T-60 armour worthless. I think a better reward would be new plans (such as the BOS barricade, BOS painted walls, new T-60 plans), rather than rewards that people have worked hard for.
---
I care zero about this failing or succeeding. The rewards are meaningless, and there's no sense of engagement or narrative.    
---
 I am completely disinterested.
---
Have you actually claimed all of your unlocks on the Legendary Run board? Mine slows down like crazy when I open it, but I have 75 of the blinking "Claim!" icons, because I'm waiting to claim everything in one go when I hit 100. I thought that was just the reason mine runs like crap.
---
Yep I have Fo1st with a bottomless scrap box &amp; find it daunting. For newbies &amp; people without Fo1st it is undoable
---
Defenitely crickets (funnily enough I love these lil fellas IRL)
---
Radrats r pretty annoying when theyre neutral to you. That day i had to chase down and spray some random radrat that the travelling merchant bots were chasing. Couldnt vats them due to them being neutral too
---
It's probably only a reward in the first place because they know it won't sell in the Atom Shop.
---
Players aren’t even going to be storing that much of either of those items. They weren’t in demand for anything so duper’s weren’t duping, and FO1st members just have whatever random amount they came across (I’ll bet less than 1k), and everyone else might have 100 at most.
---
You can see here:  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/es/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/es/events)
---
They need to adjust the rewards.  If each provisioner box had a 10% chance to include 1 gold bullion, or 50% chance to include 5 scrip, I would be busting my ass to find concrete right now.
---
Yes I have everything claimed, I am around rank 80 now
---
Prisoners with jobs.
---
Heavy weapons build with power armor and I can mow throw hordes of any robot, and take hardly any damage. Like other said, go for the legs and stealth range too if that’s your style. 
---
Don’t get me started on mirelurk deep kings....
---
If they are feeling kind
---
I heard they want to name this one Howard Dam.
---
I had a 3star bloodied variant on sale for about 2 weeks, someone bought it about 3 days ago though
---
&gt; you're a new player.
---
Don't resort to assumptions.  You know what those make you look like... Between lvl 320 and 205 all the way from B.E.T.A. I'm quite far from a new player. I agree, no point in continuing with someone who'll bend over backwards and reach for every excuse and assumption to excuse this.
---
Yeah I’ve claimed everything I’ve unlocked so far. This is the one thing that everybody seems to be dealing with on all platforms so I think the board is just screwed right now
---
&gt; "Sorry, event failed, you didn't donate enough. We are just gonna throw out the content and rewards we worked on for weeks"
---
They'll just sell it in the Atom Shop.
---
I dont have FO1st and 250 concrete was tough to come by, tried excavating it at bog town and it took forever, then I tried farming bags of cement and gnomes which was easier but required a bit of hopping, overall I hope we something easier next
---
WTF.... blimey that is insane. How did Beth mess this up so badly
---
You on Xbox? I have 15 gilded minigun and about 10 gilded .44 revolvers
---
I’m gonna look around and see if I can trade it plus some caps for a croc pack
---
aaaaaaand concrete is easiest to get than Cork
---
I don’t understand the ‘never spent a penny’ concept. But I fully admit, that’s just me. If I like something, I’m more than willing to pay for it. You obviously like the game.
---
I would have rather just seen it in the shop in the first place than have it tied to some ridiculous amount of resource, no one, not even dupers have in their stash box.
---
The whole reason it's not automatically updated is so they can adjust the numbers as needed. That said, I'd have more faith in them if it did fail....lol....I not so secretly want it to fail.
---
We'll see when the rewards are finally given, but my opinion (and I may be wrong) is that you're right that they don't want to waste the time they've put towards creating the items, but don't think the objectives will autocomplete and provide us with the rewards regardless. Instead, I think we'll just see the missed items in the Atomic Shop instead. A way for them to kill two birds with stone and entirely within their ethos.
---
There is. Down the steps from the tent by the PA workbench. There is also a weapon and armor bench on that lower patio.
---
You got ripped off on the pie haha. You can just go grab one from West tek roof
---
I found I was spending money on atoms about once a month so though why not get fallout 1st. Why not enjoy atoms and all the benefits that come with it.
---
Carry some troubleshooters armor with you when you know you will encounter them.  I use a full set when running the missel silo.
---
Personally I think scrap box let’s you focus on the game versus weight mgmt and I love private servers as a way to try things and not worry about others looting a spot ahead of you.  The tent is a nice perk to save a jump and put it where you will be back again soon to cut time and convenience.  Also on public if I want to make a low level some armor or mod a weapon I have so much scrap I don’t worry about it with my 1st box.  Up to you, but I am with the guy above, love it warts and all
---
Not all.    
---
"Thrill of the Grill" for me tends to trigger again right after I complete it but only one time.    
---
The past 2 days though some haven't come up at all.
---
Or they come in another prydwen, so no need for a new base
---
Wow, you've been playing A LOT! I know because I am also 170ish, and started playing 2 months ago. Hello fellow addict lol.
---
I am not particularly interested in participating. 
---
Frankly Bethesda isn’t going to spend money developing content and then not release it.
---
To be honest i think i have a mild addiction to this game, But it’s just hard to spend money on it but i might consider it
---
&gt; There are two things: patches and hotfixes. 
---
And Bethesda is horrible with either. At this point I am hoping for a rollback to update 20...
---
If the devs are not capable of fixing things during regular updates, what gives anyone the idea that they will be able to do so with a hotfix? Anything they do 'hot' is just going to break 27 things in the process.
---
god i really hope they don’t come in an airship again
---
I donated so much steel and didn't get any plans or weapons or anything. Never again.
---
I’m kinda tempted
---
Once a day and not on weekends.
---
Wait it gives you atoms ?
---
I agree entirely. This is an absolutely absurd number especially considering anyone with enough material has been banned or stopped playing like myself due to the abundant amount of crap this company puts us through
---
Yeah I don't see the point then, Whitesprings makes more sense, you get loads of ingredients plus ridiculous amounts of legendary drops.
---
I liked Arms Race better
---
Hotfixes are still a thing, but not all will be well advertised or even obvious to end users if you don't look for them.
---
In the last few days I've had a couple of instances of 'updating from server' when selecting weapons. It's a good bet that these were on-demand downloads and essentially hotfixes for minor issues.
---
The wife and I started playing on the same day, but due to her getting distracted with rebuilding her camp over and over again, I'm level 45 and she's only 28.
---
Preaching to the choir!  I'm only sitting on 100k of cork too.  That should be met with no problem either.  LOL.
---
I just started getting it this morning and now can't get on a server at all.
---
Hope it's not another bout of server problems like a few months ago where we could hardly play for a few days.
---
Do you have your game installed on an external ssd?
---
Bring you nothing in Combat.
---
LOL
---
"Nice ship guys! Compensating for something?"
---
Maybe the BoS update is such a big, buggy mess that it causes the game to crash at launch. If you somehow manage to get in, all the textures are replaced with Ward's face.
---
Bethesda are hoping the event fails so they can go; 'ah well, try again next year'.
---
Steel is also super easy to farm so running a little low isn't a huge deal because there's always more.
---
I gave 2000 steel. I had 3000 in total and I sell my steel in bulk every time I got about 4k. I currently have 115 concrete and 221 cork. Next the BOS will be asking for 100 million screws. Fuck em.
---
Yeah I think it's a sever problem because it also won't load the atomic shop or even let me on a server to play now.
---
The true power lies in finding a *real* build.
---
Ooh thx for the info I’m gonna go grab some from there and the 250 isn’t that bad I’ve seen people sell them for 1k but seriously though thx I’m gonna fill my diner setup now with a couple of those
---
It's the apocalypse.    
---
Things happen and most people understand how new players are learning and all. Don't let someone else ruin it for you.    
---
Events have rules and a goal. Follow them and you'll get used to how they work overall.    
---
What do you play 76 on? I'm on PC and could help some. You can PM me for more if you want.
---
Alright, if you can't my offer will still be there.
---
Tent and scrapbox are pretty useful items.  
---
Private world, IMO, is useful only if you prefer solo game and/or want to use mule.  
---
Again, IMO, rest of benefits - I wouldn't call them "benefits". I don't care about visuals, so I don't need atoms.
---
As part of fallout 1st you get monthly atoms, private world, bottomless scrap box, some fallout 1st exclusives (when they decide to do them).
---
well damn, i feel like a bit of a noob.   Thanks!  I moved my tent for steel cos i had so much, but i don't want to move it again.
---
Make me.
---
Those numbers they wanted from us for concrete and cork are fucking way to unreasonable.
---
It’s so funny how Bethesda turned Vault Boy, a parody of corporate iconography, into exactly that.
---
It seems worth it , I may look into it
---
Had it done to me as well... just myself and the ID10T that started my event almost 8 minutes before the timer expired. No one had time to Fast Travel to help in the event, nor did he wear PA but sat on the roof... meaning he had no desire to help as a conduit. A$$!!!
---
I will not be participating in this circus clown show.
---
Sorry should have responded here, fallout 1st u gat monthly atoms, private server, scrap box.
---
I own most buildables except wastelanders bundle and the free state bundles due to it being  overpriced for one or two buildables and half always being a flag in a tire. Building is why I exists in this game anymore.  I have a few characters that had 20-40k steel on them. Concrete was 2.8k between five guys. I gave up 750 on one of them and I regret it. I think the steel was reasonable but cork and concrete should have been 50 mil and that still seems like a stretch. Plastic and cloth is easy to farm but it’s heavily used in bullet production and bulking. That’s like taking cigarettes from prisoners.
---
That does seem pretty cool
---
I believe so.  I recall hearing that the last community event didn't update on the weekends either.
---
See if you can find a streamer on twitch that's streaming xbox that doesnt have it on an external hard drive who is doing line in the sand or rad rumble(yes I know that's a whole list lol) I remember watching someone a few days ago and my friend went that's how bad my game gets.. I literally never have any of the issues I was seeing.
---
Ok that seems worth it I suppose, i might have to give it a shot
---
Forgot to add one more IMO - it's overpriced :)
---
There are 10 or so at the top of the Monorail Elevator and another 4 or 5 near the vendor in Harper's Ferry.
---
their ship shows up in West Virginia. before they have a chance to land, remnants enclave, responders, raiders, settlers, and free states show up and shoot them out of the sky. we claim their loot, which is a couple of outfits ported from fo4 and 3 new handmade rifle conversion skins. they even bring with them a new automatic gauss rifle, but its actually just a handmade skin too. we then get a dlc that focuses on developing new factions we had in the game already
---
I think Phase 2 will be better, I’m mean Wood, Leather, Cloth, and Glass and are things people have more of than bloody concrete and cork which is a bummer. I like the rewards for all of the challenges and I am happy the BoS are coming to the game. I also haven’t finished the Legendary Run and really want to so the bonus SCORE challenges would be nice.... but 200 million cork and 150 million concrete? Cmon Bethesda.
---
Works for me. But won't appeal to everyone. I did a monthly subscription to see if I like it, half considering getting the annual subscription.
---
How much ? This kinda seems good
---
Nice. The only thing with SB meat is that it goes off... I wish the bullion backpack stopped all spoiling. :(
---
True true
---
I miss the Score Autocomplete posts.
---
I should go try it then
---
Don't think a Deathclaw would give me Lover's Embrace like she does.
---
At least they didn't ask for aluminum.
---
NP.
---
Presuming you also do the WS cottage loop, loot everything you see.  All those aid items and junk Ittms add up.  2x Around and you’ll be at max caps on the day,
---
  If it’s any consolation, I could‘t keep much more than a few hundred caps until I was well past L50. Al those PA mod plans etc are not cheap 
---
Once I broke 100, started to slowly climb.  As long as I have the 6k for Smiley, I’m good to go :)
---
No... This has nothing to do with your fucking conspiracy theory that the entire player base is behind whatever stupid ass complaints you have. No one had any reason to hoard concrete prior to this, it's scarce to find in mass quantities, practically only available as static spawns and heavy as fuck when you do collect it.
---
yes. you THOUGHT... but Beth never said they will add: NEW RARE plans. ;)
---
i HOPED for new plans to catch but as we all now know: nothing!
---
That's up to you, for me am trying it on a monthly basis as can always cancel it.
---
They are Fisto bots?  Thats a branch of the BoS I'm not familiar with.
---
The weasels got me by the brain banana
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st)  
---
15 eur per month  
---
or 10 eur per month in case year subscription
---
Honestly who cares. The 150 scrip limit already has me just dumping legendaries on the ground. Why am I going to try to craft more?
---
It’s supposed to be story building, all these supplies will eventually become the BoS headquarters as that update is coming soon. Basically, it’s like we are helping to bring them back. In the end if you don’t help they will still come, you just lose on bonus item that you can probably by later
---
To flip his **flat**jacks with.
---
There's little downside if you have class freak and Starched Genes. Whilst some may seem like negatives they will even out as you add more, especially with the perks. You could be more selective if you want the last tiny percentage but in my current build I literally just died in the radioactive river next to my camp lots and lots of times, server hopping on respawn until I had them all (-1 of course). Crude but effective. I ended up with herbivore but I think I'll live with it until I have the remaining serum plans stored up and then I'll quaff radaway until it disappears., fill in the gaps from stored serums, and off to war again.
---
Same here, and only 1200 or so, I don't know what people without F01 are going to do.. collect for three days to get a stimpack and a toaster?
---
Betcha they're gonna ask for 100 million Screws next.
---
Right?  I've joined many public teams now. Could care less if the other players were men, women, transgender, gay, undecided, ghouls, super mutants, or goats. Really don't care what other players do in their personal lives.
---
Custom icon?
---
There is a dam in disrepair already - not far south of the power plant.
---
I only started playing with Wastelanders and I always have max caps, I just keep buying all plans at Whitespring I do not even need, otherwise doing any event seems pointless to me, so looks like I will start buying bulks
---
I'm not sure what's more hilarious, that there are people that seriously think companies fudge the numbers on this shit or that people seriously think the failure to meet this goal has anything to do with community angst rather than the actual scarcity of concrete.
---
Spruce Knob Boat Rental also can't be entered.  Same quest line, same problem.  Still not fixed.  The sacks of garbage went a video sent to them of the problem.
---
Update: I restarted my xbox and logged back in, seemed to have solved it for me at least.
---
No thanks, I want it to fail.  If we complete these then we can expect more just like it.
---
I'm a bloodied stealth sniper who's ran everymutstion since beta. You'll be fine, but instead of trying to get the chameleon mutation to work with your armor just get 1 price of chameleon armor
---
What level are the Scorched when you nuke Morgantown?
---
I played yesterday from 3pm until 10pm. That’s not typical, but happens more than it probably should.
---
The scrap box is outstanding. The tent is convenient (glad others can use it, but get off it when fighting Scorched Queen plox.) And the atom stipend is what you’re spending your real money on anyway.
---
Private server is useful but not as clutch as I thought it would be. It’s super nice when the theft bugs were rampant. And if I really cared enough about The Brotherhood, I could theoretically pump Bog Town concrete all day. (Fuck those guys though!)
---
The outfits are mediocre. But the emotes are delightful.
---
wow
---
It’s going to be BoS themed I believe
---
Thanks eh
---
I wonder how many people of this subreddit even understand the shaving remark.
---
Calibrated with sniper barrel.
---
Make sure to have all the heavy gunner perks and stabilized.
---
The damage isn't super crazy against the SBQ but it's really nice for 2-shotting all the scorched nice and quick.
---
oh wow. i thought people would be cleaning out their stashes for these lmao. im doing the opposite, gathering everything i can to cancel 1st before renewal. maybe im not the only one.
---
As for getting rid of herbivore, taking a radaway while mutated and not using starched genes will randomly take away 1 mutation per radaway
---
Seriously! I'm the same way, I stay overencumbered because I hoard like mad because "you never know when you'll need it" and I was only able to donate maybe 3 times for the concrete! It's just that, typically, when you run across bags of it, you usually have to bypass grabbing them for the weight alone unless you happen to be close to a workbench, plus so many people use a good bit on general camp building, and it's just not as easily found in the world as steel. I'm really sad about it, too, b/c I REALLY wanted that banner!
---
Yeah.... once per character, and once per day pretty much...
---
I am a player who donated 2k steel.  I donated 0 concrete.
---
Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.
---
good advice, thank you and yeah I will have to work a little harder.
---
Well duh it’s not gonna be solid concrete the cork is gonna be filler.   Ain’t no building regulations in post war Appalachia! *taps forehead*
---
Abandoned Waste Dump in the mire has a nest - and the accompanying angry parents.
---
30 seconds, 120 cap reward.
---
Its passable as long as I'm not to far away.  Travel costs will cut the profit.
---
Two nests in Abandon Waste Bunker...don’t know if they have eggs.
---
Bog Town is probably easier.
---
So I have a tip for those of you that have friends, want the BoS stuff completed, and have time. If you have two friends with fo1st and you have it yourself. Get together on one private world. Go to the monorail elevator near fort defiance. Go to the third floor with the elevator and go through the train. The first one in does NOT collect the loot if it spawned for them. 
---
This will give you 80 lead with no acid needed, AND 70 concrete. Only ONE of you will loot it. The person that loots it just be in power armor so you can jump down store the stuff and fast travel away. Go to one of the others private world now and repeat. The looter MUST be away from the location when they open their private world. Someone that didn't loot will go in spawn the loot and the looter will quick travel to their tent to loot it. 
---
It's safer to do this if you don't join a group seems to be hit or miss in groups. Three people with private worlds will ensure no down time.
---
I know there is always one in the nest on Deathclaw Island.... at least for me there has been.
---
Just like I did with my spongebob radio/music player, kids stuck caps in between the vents
---
mr.gutsy... all these screaming patriotic bots scare me the shit out. :joy:
---
How much is in bog town? I also recommended the monorail so they have the added benefit of lead
---
I just hope that this game will have an ending. Like closing the fissures and cleaning up all the mutants and scorched
---
Shoot on legs
---
Don't remind of the time we had to murder a robot when we wanted to go online...
---
oh no I meant a little up, sorry
---
I dont have friends, let me finish, that want to play a loading screen/elevator ride/pick things up simulator.
---
Stupid rewards not worth it 
---
Especially when the real fallout76 player know that they will release it with a BOS bundle in a few weeks
---
I've noticed a sharp decline in damage after the patch as well, but nothing this horrible.. damn man that's shitty.
---
I appreciate your optimism but a 96% top up seems a little ... questionable.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to not dump concrete.
---
It's a good tip if I'm understanding you fully. I just didn't want to miss out on that banner, specifically, tbh, so I do want to make this goal, if nothing else. Man, I thought the cork was going to be a problem, but this has been more of a booger than I expected!
---
I don't know how many but for fallout new vegas fans they might understand it
---
Good for you. This is not a command. 🙄
---
Third person. If you don't want to do that you'll have to use an actual scope. If you don't want to do THAT then put a little dot of tape where your crosshair is on your screen
---
Tell me about it. I WAS going to do a nice Fixer build, but that things like shooting spit wads right now.
---
Bog Town has *many* bags of concrete in the hotel’s second level.
---
And it has the pair of resource mining machines you can hook up when you take the workshop. Obviously, doing it on your own server would be easier.
---
Downsides: The attacks on Bog Town aren’t fun.
---
EDIT: Apparently there are three concrete machines.
---
It depends on the weapon and the scope you are using.
---
Whow, thanks buddy! I havent been up there in a very long time! And there was enough of the stuff. Also made my highest drop down I guess 😂 I love my 2x reduces falling damage armor pieces 😂
---
The lack of any worthy grind for veteran players is reason enough not to participate in turning anything in.  We'll see if all the low level noobs make up for us.  They are the only group who would benefit from the drops.
---
I'm sure cork will be an issue as well.
---
From my experience, if you want to attach a mod, you simply find whatever mod it is in the weapon's "modify" list (E.G. Shishkebab Extra Flame Jets) and attach the mod. One way to know for sure it's a mod you have in your inventory is if it shows up when you don't know the recipe/don't have enough materials for it. From there it's a material-free modification
---
I feel that someone will use it to break the game more and dupe even hardwr
---
What game did you play?
---
get really bad anxiety around them, being a level 46 little baby character.
---
Nevermind, it came back. Scared me for a minute, though.
---
Okay? Then the suggestion isn't for you. Want a cookie? 🍪
---
What the hell would they do with it all anyway? 
---
Here.. all the steel you need.
---
Awesome. 
---
We have a huge pile of used concrete for you. 
---
Err... Thanks.
---
And a boat load of golf balls.
---
Wait 
---
And some plastic bottles. 
---
Command. Let's not go to Appalachia, it's a silly place.
---
I'm so glad someone asked this! I kept trying to find an answer on the search thingy, but had no luck. I've been wondering the same thing!
---
Form a club but never play together, that should work
---
Me too
---
that BoS message gave me every reason NOT to help them
---
five will get you ten we're going to be called savages by their wandering patrols like the Outcasts in FO3
---
my first order of business will be to put all three silos on them
---
This!
---
I was pretty sure they were using another glitch that provided infinite health, but also let effects stack indefinitely.  Ie infinite bobbleheads and chems and food and unyielding to maximize intelligence and xp gain.  
---
Lifegiver infinite life didnt do much for you in score other than keep you alive.  Unless I'm missing something.
---
I don’t remember that in FNV. Just remember having to do that myself and then soaking and forming it. Walking around for a day with a wet beret on.
---
God forbid you showed up in formation in an unshaven fuzzy beret.
---
Those were the days.
---
I have lost all faith the in the development team of Fallout 76. I get the impression it isn't really a team either - the result that we are seeing is more akin to software developers working on a rotation/allocation basis; almost like they are rotating programmers from other teams/projects when they have idle time, and Fallout 76 is the lucky winner that helps keep staff utilisation up at Bethesda. 
---
The end result is a total lack of continuity, with bugs not getting fixed as they don't get core programmers rotated onto FO76 long enough for that to happen. Secondly, whoever is managing the workload does not seem to place a high enough priority on these serious issues and probably understates the issues when communicating it to the higher-ups. 
---
When I saw that video of Pete Hines in his garden sipping on an ice-tea, he didn't look like a man that was aware of the current dumpster fire that is update 21. If he was aware, then maybe it is a sign that Bethesda has indeed stopped caring for FO76.
---
The gameplay experience has been horrible since this update, and I am a rage-quit or two away from cancelling my FO1st subscription. At this point I can spend my time more constructively by pouring a bottle of fish hooks into my pants and digging them out in the dark.
---
Not trap as in you can’t move 🤦🏻‍♀️ have you never heard of a trap camp? It’s like you spawn in and there’s 50 million flamethrower traps in a corridor
---
There's NO way that amount can be done in 4 days or whatever the time was for it.
---
Didn't know about the bags that is good to know. I know the collectors are an option I just figured I'd put out a option for the people wanting to gather a lot. If they could they should definitely hit the location you mentioned.
---
Perfect but now you have given me a use for them if they ever give her a location.  I find this radio announcer to be the most uncharismatic radio host so far. I’ve actually switched to spotify because I can’t take her. I’m not a huge fan of rose but she at least would have made sense. She’s been around for it all and could have had updates  based on what’s going on around the map.
---
1. How do I use a mod that I've picked up? They act in the same way as a plan except the box will disappear after use. 
---
2. Does scrapping a mod ever give you the plan for that mod? No, think of it as knowing the mod but not how it fits.
---
3. Does scrapping armor drop mods for that armor, the way weapons do? Yes but I find it's more rare, probably because you generally scrap far fewer armour pieces than weapons.
---
4. Why are half of the mods I find for a barbed walking cane? Some are very common. Some are very rare. Welcome to the world of Fixed spawns vs RNG.
---
5. Any other? Yes. You'll soon learn what to scrap and what to sell, and also what scrap to hoard for the future (hint: Never sell Ballistic Fibre).
---
Like most people have said, shotguns and heavy weapons will be your friends. Twisted Muscles mutation will knock your accuracy a bit if you have it but with Class Freak it won't be too bad. If you want max accuracy at range I would actually suggest miniguns. Doesn't even have to be bloodied or have any magic effects, but either or both will melt anything in seconds from pretty much any range.
---
My question is, how the heck does a robot get diseased? It's made of metal! The only one, realistically, that should be at all vulnerable to disease would be a robo-brain, since there is actually an organic bit, but otherwise, it makes zero sense!
---
Bethesda's either gonna fail it with us providing less than 10 million concrete or fudge numbers and just give it to us to not waste an asset.
---
But they could fail us and sell us the asset instead...
---
And the friends we discover along the way?
---
Anyone telling you to "just switch out perks to use heavy guns/shotguns"
---
Certified donkey brain.
---
Best mellee combo for bloodied is melee and rifleman/commando.
---
No perk switching, swap high damage weapons on the fly.
---
N O P E R K S W A P P I N G.
---
&gt; piles pixelate
---
This is caused by the Tesla gun. Its the lighting effect, after a while you can see the individual tiles of FO76's [tile-based deferred lightning engine](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/deferredshading-111121230216-phpapp02/95/deferred-shading-70-728.jpg?cb=1321917476) flickering. You can more clearly see the tiles when you put some geometry in front it (can be meatpiles, but anything really).
---
Nope.  I have noticed every now and then my game slows right down but that's usually when I first start it up and fast travel somewhere.
---
BoS can have all the burnt books they want.
---
See, I fully expected THAT one to be, but I didn't think the concrete one would be this much of a slog, though. Oy!
---
One time, at Possum Scouts camp, I shoved a whole HH-3A capacitor up my butt.
---
Yes, I'm getting tired of seeing basically reposts of the same thing over and over again. Like, the bare minimum would be to advise on how to fix this.
---
And there’s me thinking I was a badass punching a bloatfly to death.
---
Thanks, I'll check that place out!
---
All that for 3 bottles of shitty booze.
---
But it's free fast travel...
---
yep
---
On top of the daily tasks for scrip, settlers, money, gold, and SCORE, I just don’t have the play time to help out with BOS event.
---
Plus they made the easiest one steel? It’s like the amounts are backwards.
---
Manhunt is not a public event.  It is not free.  Unfortunately.
---
I don't even have enough concrete for a single turn in 😂 I don't understand why they even need cork.
---
Not bending over backwards... just pointing out you made a misleading post. Either intentionally misleading, or you made a mistake. Just own it. It’s not a big deal lol.
---
Not sure the concrete I dropped was worth a handful of stims and chems
---
Hmm okay, might not be the external hard drive then.. dam it lol, thought I was onto something... on a side note... is your xbox gamer picture the same as this one is?
---
I only listed it because of all of the BoS-themed CAMPs I've seen posted here over the past few years. That, and the people in the various "concrete count" threads talking about wanting it.
---
Personally, I'm only interested in the Collectron (just to have a free variant that isn't the Santatron) and the double SCORE Challenges. I don't care about any of the other stuff.
---
I'm a bloodied build with a magic shotgun so I one shot all of them can't remember them actually being a problem
---
I agree that the number for concrete was outrageous, there’s only 1 event that gives you concrete and not a lot at that. If they wanted to make this doable then they should have either lowered the numbers or make getting concrete far easier than it actually is.
---
If you've got at least 3 points in Perception, put one point each in Rifleman/Expert Rifleman/Master Rifleman. That's a 30% damage boost right there. Add in a Bloodied Rifle and you're doing good.
---
Zerk fists!
---
The Caster isn't the best weapon for the SBQ. It's super fun to use for just about everything else though. For the Queen you need good sustained DPS, the plasma caster is too slow for that.
---
unequip everything, weapons &amp; armor, then ft to somewhere and re-equip. If that doesn't solve it, unequip and restart the game.
---
That link isn’t even about autocomplete. And yes the display of them is buggy.
---
Yeah but can't go farming workshops when you have PvP relics ready to pounce on you the second you claim it. Can't even claim workshops for the betterment of the community.
---
Cork. So no.
---
I was referencing zach from mikeburnfire who talks about his experience in the military while playing fallout new Vegas
---
They probably kill me more than anything else in the game especially when they surprise me and slap, slap, slap, broken legs, disoriented, 1/3 health, spin around to find 'em and dead.
---
I treat them like assaultrons, get some cover and blow off their stupid legs so they waddle at me.
---
Seems like cork is pretty farmable with via pipe weapons and scrapper.  I know it was something I always was chucking when I was playing consistently.
---
for me I just get PTSD of their fallout 3 counterparts, where back then they were the most disgusting and horrifying enemy model they ever made, scared shitless if they ever got into melee range, I had a better time killing those damn giant frostbite spiders in Skyrim
---
Camps are very likely going the way of private interiors in 2021, so we may not have to defend them in the future.
---
I’d take an addictol and a disease cure to be safe.
---
You can just buy the mutations you want. Player vendors usually have them for 350-600 caps depending on the player (mine are 450)
---
As melee, if you have a dense mod on your torso, SBs will never hurt you again.
---
You say that as if it is a 'bad' thing...
---
Do that a million times and were all good.👍
---
1. Some weapons cannot be modified like the LMG, black power rife/pistol. 
---
2. You can get mods by scrapping armor and weapons. 
---
3. Barbed walking cane is a really common mod to find.
---
I've suspected something like this would be coming for a while now, and since I have FO1st, I have made a point to pillage anything that wasn't nailed down, followed by the nails, and then the previously nailed down stuff. But the quantities being asked for with rarer materials like concrete and cork are ridiculous, and with the rewards being so terrible, I'm probably not going to give more than a few thousand from each of my precious scrap stockpiles.
---
ESPECIALLY since I've got a really nasty feeling that the upcoming Instanced Interiors for C.A.M.P.s will be ridiculously expensive to craft. I suspect they are trying to deplete everyone's resources so that people will be forced to play and scavenge it all instead of relying on their stockpiles. "Oh you want an instanced interior camp that is an underground bunker? That's gonna cost you 50k steel, 10k concrete, 30k wood, and 500 violet flux. It's a shame you gave all that scrap to the Brotherhood back in August, guess you'll just have to go scavenging for it".
---
I had to go look it back up; it wasn't an icon, but the custom profile picture.  You can set that if you look at you camera roll when logged in with the character that you want the picture changed on.
---
why not both?
---
I'm not donating anything. No berets and banners for me.
---
I have several I've picked up from the machines and a couple from west tek...I usually sell them for 50 caps now that I've learned they're out in the world. Seemed so much cooler when it was just from the machines LOL
---
dumped over 1,000 hours on PS4....Definitely not moving to another platform for this game even planning on getting Series X as well
---
The killing scorched event was fun because it didn’t require you to grind something.  Gathering cork or concrete requires you to essentially stop playing in hopes you can grind.  
---
The first question that should be asked with events is “Will the players have fun doing this?”  Farr too often it seems developers forget that.
---
This happened to me yesterday. I lost all my junk from the queen fight. RIP stable flux. To make it worse it happened while fighting wendigo collosus. The rest of my team killed it while I was trying to respawn and I came back to no body to loot. Probably the most frustrated I've been with this game in a long time.
---
If you use power armor, then the score you earn doesn’t show the bar going up on the bottom of the screen. Exit your PA and it does it all at once. It’s just visual and you still get the score and rewards but it’s still annoying when you have score constantly spamming your screen
---
Feel free to provide the correct information then. This is the latest from them. If they choose to not update and provide misleading information it's their own fault.
---
That guy does it after lunch break once a day.
---
Nah. I kill myself every few minutes since I use grenades like crazy and am not careful.
---
I don't join teams in NW, because I'm a full bush wookie just trying to earn SCORE and NW prizes. 
---
Yesterday's challenge was different, and a bit annoying, but at least it presented me with the opportunity to figure out how to accomplish it.
---
Why does a prewar robot have an afterwar currency? I dont think they used nuka for fuel
---
Energy weapons, something with a Troubleshooter perk, both if you can. I'm usually pretty successful with a plasma caster.
---
Unsure if Eugenie sells bulked concrete, as well. Though she's more about guns and bullets, so she's usually selling bulked items that are crafted into ammo rather than concrete, which is typically used for crafting camp stuff and defensive walls.
---
If we fail, it's just going to end up either in season 2 or I'm the atomic shop
---
If enough people did it there would be a difference.
---
damn good tick blood for bloodpacks though, redeems them for me
---
Seen that one and doesn't qualify. Vanguard Junkies/Vampire build. I use armor. Adds at literal random, I can open the game and get score adds and reward pop-ups.
---
Oh, idk then
---
It happened to me I had to hop servers about 5 times till it worked
---
Yeah, its super weird. Its probably related to the power armor, I've definitely been in and out of it. It probably breaks using it, not being in it. Also seen 0/8 of dailies when im done with them.
---
Too bad it's still a multiplayer game.
---
Would be interesting if they outright executed him and this BoS chapter that is coming is actually an evil one.
---
You really are doubling down on this huh?  I’ll get back to you in a few hours when they update. I’m curious what your response will be.
---
We know.
---
It's not worth it.
---
Savage Divide icon looks like an observatory
---
Yeah, but I am wondering if the increments matter. I currently has 2500 candy. Do I need to wait until I get to 5000 candy before I have a shot at a legendary Dragon?
---
Anything that staggers or causes loss of controls. Drives me nuts when you can't move for a bit in the heat of combat.
---
Second place goes to Insta-Disease. You look sideways at a feral ghoul from 100 meters and suddenly "You have contracted Rad worms".
---
The thing that bothers me about Assaultrons is their beam weapons. You do the Enclave Bots on Parade, at the end the Assaultrons take a bit to charge and shoot the final mobs. You find one in a silo, and it's an insta-melt beam that goes for ages.
---
There is a stash box at atlas.  Right near the stairs.
---
Clearly they are struggling to manage scrap box space, so they came up with some sleazy way to free up server space while tricking their player base into thinking it was a fair trade.
---
I’ve been getting a lot of *missing required ammo* upon logging in when I’m holding my lever with ample ammo. Have to switch weapons to be able to fire it.
---
Bloodied LMG is fantastic for a now-and-then ranger weapon. Gatling gun is a heavy main weapon because the ammo efficiency is greats but for a weapon you don’t use a ton, I’d use the LMG. 
---
Shotgun misses the point for you, they’re very short range to begin with and you’re already a melee build.
---
However if you want a gun to shoot the Queen with and not feel useless during the flying phase, a Gatling laser/plasma gun will all give you long term sustained fire (albeit low actual damage).
---
good lord. i am offering my first born child for that fix... i am really scared to play any big event because of that ashole bug.
---
sry for "ashole" but this bug really makes me angry! all the bugs ingame... bad. BUT THIS: AAAAGGGROOOOOO!!!!
---
Filthy mutant.
---
I did RR last night on PS4 and didn’t have any frame troubles... Same with line in the sand. Wonder what causes it?
---
They definitely got that reference right
---
Those plans were so heavily duped they are worth about 15 caps each
---
I got my code similarly and have used the Bethesda launcher, but noticed when I linked my Bethesda and steam accounts, the game showed up (along with 1 and 2, weirdly) in my steam library with 0 hours played.
---
I’m definitely sad that we won’t get all the rewards since concrete is ridiculously hard to get
---
I've got a funny feeling the BOS vertibird PA and matching jetpack will be the level 100 reward. No source or anything for that, just a hunch based on something someone said a little while back.
---
Plasma casters work a lot like vats shotguns build wise. They're tricky things as they need a lot of stats. I've found unyielding works great for the extra agi and luck it gives. Full health is going to harder as you still need that agi and luck boost. Maybe use carnivore and eat scorchbeasts? Also partboy/girl with wine or rum will give short buffs. As for SBQ they work fine as long as you're using vats.
---
&gt; I'm curious
---
You wouldn't be if you took a break from fighting to excuse this and instead took a moment to read.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i75fz0/z/g0zv198
---
&gt; My post highlights latest available information on the event. Once there is a change I'll be happy to update. For now, this is what Bethesda provided.
---
Awesome map of where to find resources:
---
https://fo76map.com
---
I have just gotten used to living with rad worms. As far as I’m concerned, it’s just a chronic condition.
---
The challenge to complete 7600 hours exploring the wasteland will take you 7600 hours of gameplay. Is that what you are trying to say?
---
It amazes me how assed up people get over this nothing issue..
---
they should have made it 76000 hours.. maybe then more people would get the point...
---
Duchess is thicccccc for sure
---
I want one too. Specifically, I want one programmed like KL-E-O from Fallout 4 to act as a vending machine. Have it spout lines like:
---
"Everything here is guaranteed to injure, maim, or kill at your discretion. Except me. I only kill when I want to".
---
"Anything that can kill a man, I sell. Except suicidal depression. That is unfortunately not packageable".
---
"I've got a weapon here for every occasion: Hunting, Protection, Cold-Blooded murder, Hot-Blooded Murder".
---
I'm just going to chime in here an say that's not my experience at all.  I've had events where no one shoots and she didnt land once.  Just kept dusting.
---
30 minutes pass with no landing.  Event fails.  Lots of angry emotes.
---
On the other hand, I have been able to get her to land by shooting her to aggro and moving to open space.  Which I've been told, does not help.  Yet it does in my experience.  She'll  land on me and then is subject to the collective dps monster that is the gathered crowd.
---
I'm of the impression that without the ability to force land her via crippling, we just end up subjected to the whims of the bethesda AI, which is braindead to put it nicely.
---
Being a junkie heavy I dont care if she lands or not.  She'll melt all the same.  But its obnoxious that she doesnt cooperate.  I'm pretty sure that this will never be fixed either, simply because we've "found" ways to "cope" with it.
---
If you find any that have their core missing, my bad.
---
I run unyielding with 40ag, shadowed mods and every possible boost and sometimes I don’t even break hidden when I shoot an enemy on the edge of a group.  I notice when I’m not quite at 19% health and my ag drops to 35.  LOL
---
I’ve been playing a stealth sniper since Fo3, so I’m super familiar with the build and was an early adopter of bloody/uny back in Dec 2018 when TSE was the meta. maybe I’m just very sensitive to it.  I dunno.
---
If there were ever a place for the auto-complete bug to kick in, that would be now. /s
---
I launched three nukes in a row yesterday and got 10 messages saying thank you for giving them something to do.  So I launched the Imposter Sheepsquach which was a big fail but three out of four was not bad.
---
At the dam where you take down mad dog Malone they put a bed in the out building. Never noticed it before either.  Wierd place to put bed tho
---
I love seeing people break it down into raw data.
---
Dont forget all those tapes u need to use at radio towers, they have cloth inside if i remember well
---
They’d better make that banner available to us somehow, it’s BS they give us a challenge to get ridiculous numbers of one of the more rare materials in the game, this one is on Bethesda.
---
We don't have a chance in hell and everyone knows it. 
---
 I slaughtered scorched in every waking moment to hit 32 million because it was achievable.
---
This isn't going to happen with concrete because:
---
A: It is unachievable.
---
B: It's the most boring community event ever conceived. The biggest mistake of these challenges was that whoever suggested them wasn't bitchslapped and frogmarched out of the building.
---
I've had this issue forever. Tried every nvidia setting and game setting that exists. Gave up and just live with it. Just a shitty game optimization.
---
If everyone isn't having this issue not sure why. I am still running windows 8. At the moment that it's my only guess.
---
This is pretty helpful! thanks man
---
Who would have thought making people donate millions of useful materials to get a stupid CAMP item would backfire so much?
---
Are those light boxes? Very cool!
---
No it’s plants vs zombies garden warfare. It’s like a kid friend shooter. 
---
Anyways in that game, the gnomes are the ones who secretly control time and space
---
... and why isn’t that in the actual body of the post? You keep acting like it’s the most recent number *unless * they change it. We know it’s not lol
---
Looks nice! Has to be some serious budget glitching going on there lol.
---
There's a certain reward tier that you can redeem for candy as long as you have the candy needed. I think it's the 5000 candy reward tier
---
The steel was basically just scrapping everything from events like Line in the Sand for a couple of days. Pretty easy to hit 3000 and it goes by quickly/nets you XP compared to hunting and pecking for concrete.
---
I guess they didn’t learn from the Mole Miner event.
---
bethsesda must to acknowledge the first player who will do it, because that’s a insane numbers
---
Because the post is about currently provided information, not future assumptions.
---
&gt; We
---
Lol, we who? We, the apologists? We, the ones using assumptions instead of provided information? You're speaking for yourself there. Nothing on the tracker indicates this to be outdated information.
---
LMAO, you whine long term players won't want the plans then suggest putting in legendaries?
---
As a long term player I don't want fucking legendaries.  I can't even move my character is so full of legendaries.  I'm sitting on hundreds of modules waiting to craft because I have so many damn legendaries already and I can only dump 150 worth a day.
---
If you don't want to turn in, then don't turn in, but for fuck sakes you entitled whiny babies don't expect better than SBQ stuff just for turning in some garbage that was just weighing you down anyway.
---
I carry a troubleshooter’s black powder rifle for the sole purpose of killing assaultrons. One shot to the legs and they are crawling around on the floor.
---
But one shot is all I get with that weapon, so I have to make it count. I live on the edge.
---
Removed? You must be on to something!
---
Everything seems to be crappy loot now, despite Bethesda's claim that they made "changes" in the loot system. Just a 2* meat hook and a 3* pitchfork from 2 different SBQ events last night. Night before I got a 1* rolling pin. That REALLY made me feel all warm and fuzzy!
---
   
---
I totally agree. I donated 1500 scrap steel and felt stupid. I'll be back to play when there is something fun.
---
Are you on PS4? If so, i'd love to visit
---
I don’t have that much concrete! *stands in front of a triple deep foundation house.* S-shut up! I needed it, I did this before I knew we needed concrete!
---
Yeah - it's a shame, it's hard to find a balanced medium.  
---
I remember being frustrated as a low level - people one shooting all the mobs in uranium fever.  Now, I'm the guy one shooting them annoyed at all the people....
---
Yea more boring events like this... even presentation is really poor.
---
That’s fair. We can’t really trust anyone’s word on the internet so we don’t know exactly how many people dropped their subscription
---
633, not 626
---
I've found Valhalla.  Someone else gets it.  Draw the aggro and run to open lands.  East is generally easiest but I've seen north work in a pinch if the wast is too congested.
---
Concrete is a limited item, how they expect us to complete any of these but steel is insane, unless they hope the dupers grow a heart and donate.
---
When steel finished with one day to go, I never thought we could get concrete or cork. Plastic is a maybe, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
That is awesome!
---
who in the hell is hoarding cork?
---
Numbers may be wrong. Bethesda hasn’t updated it since day 1 and while I didn’t expect us to complete this event there is a huge disparity from 170mil steel and 4 mil concrete at close tho the same point in this event. Also that 4.65mil was listed yesterday too, so definitely not the right number today. Seems likely that someone isn’t updating the numbers properly.
---
In the stairs category there is a pillar.  It has a full and half sized option.  I place the half pillar on the side of a foundation, then snap a new foundation to the bottom of the pillar.  Then you can delete the pillar.
---
If EVERYONE currently part of the subreddit gave 3 donations more, we could make it. of course this only works if everyone here is unique and no one has alt accounts, and if everyone here is actively playing... /u/BethesdaGameStudios, how the hell did you guys get such a ridiculous number for concrete, cork and plastic?! It's not as easy to come by as steel! In fact while I had about 10k steel laying around, I had less than one delivery of concrete! Are we supposed to fail it, so you can sell of the asset later???
---
Mine is on display at my camp. Proud moment to snag that one. Second one and all subsequent ones were sold.
---
I salute you for keeping the servers running.  Keep up the good work.
---
You know there are people with 2500+ hours right? They have been hard core going at it since day one. 7600 is possible for them in a shorter amount of time. But for your average Joe it ain't.
---
That's where my cork must be coming from. I like to clear out areas and haul the arsenal back to break down with scrapper. That looks like a good side source of cork and rubber!
---
How did you accomplish it, was it worth doing ?
---
Oh that one, yeah true.
---
FYI, I updated the armor list awhile back with additional stats: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17NwpXnPBzeT4Gd--3qi-ejEC46--48qtbbQdDyZrGOQ/edit?usp=sharing
---
I realize now I'll have to add Secret Service armor and Solar.
---
Radscorpions, with their damn bullshit teleport card, and shockingly high armored skin
---
Honeybeasts.... they just look so disgusting and if they get right on on me I'm terrified
---
Gulpers strangely creep me out with that little serpentine land swim they do to get closer to you
---
And anglers, FUCK anglers who are both disgusting up close and have a ranged attack that always sets me on fire and never misses no matter how much I sidestep
---
I'd prefer to fight any amount of assaultrons any day over the disgusting insects, being an energy weapons build
---
How deep does this rabbit hole go?
---
The workshop has three concrete resource nodes you can put resource extractors on.
---
Fairly certain this isn’t *actually* true, but I’ll test it tonight (I have 2 accounts). 
---
Don’t go by the Effects page, it’s notorious for “visual bugs”. Check actual damage on enemies (and don’t even trust the damage numbers, they lie all the time), etc
---
Poseidon Energy has a single extractor, George’s Scrapyard has own too. But in the end this is a pipe dream for us to get this much concrete. I actually wanted this, fuck the hat I wanted the CAMP items.
---
Like any MMO high level end-game items are often locked to the account and character. That way a new one or even a level 50 can suddenly have things they should sadly grind for.    
---
I got and made the SS Underarmor a few days ago. I HATE the how Legendary weapon drops work. What use is a Troubleshooter's Knife that does bonus damage in ranged attacks? NOTHING.    
---
Going through the SAME quests to level up another character is boring. Most gear is level locked. I try and sell it and if it sits for a few days then I scrap or script it. I tend to make everything cheap to get rid of things.
---
Nocturnal missile launcher. Coincidentally I have one for sale.....
---
I don't have any evidence but I'd say its more that bethesda dev don't understand the game and have no way of tracking inventories or they would know a dedicated hoarder like myself only has 222 concrete after a year plus.  Take the most obvious reason not some master skeem.
---
I can't prove you wrong because it's exactly what it seems like.
---
No other reason for the goals to be set so damn high.
---
I wonder if one wasteland will make a difference, by leveling the playing field. Though I only need 1 shot to down a lvl 68 super mutant, however more than one for a lvl 68 scorched and i'm not a bloodied build
---
Yeah, no. Scrapbox scrap takes up nothing more than the normal stash would, that's why they could get away with it in the first place. 100 of every piece of scrap is the same as a million of every piece of scrap, it's just a number the game has to remember and it takes the same server resources to remember the number 100 as it does to remember the number 1,000,000 instead.
---
Who wants to spend 10’s of thousands of caps to meet absurd goals for shitty cosmetics? No thanks.
---
I love how he says he plays it at least once a week when other company game leads like Jeff Kaplan and even Notch claimed they played their games every day.
---
Whether they actually did play their games daily is up for debate but hey, at least the project leader is setting reasonable goals
---
Sorry! XBox here!
---
I grab the Abandoned Bog Town workshop pretty consistently and then fast travel to the Burrows and that seems to proc the activation of both Queen of the Hunt and Cop a Squatter.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head here, I can't see any reason why they would pick two resources that nobody is actively stockpiling because there's no reason to. Before the event started I thought oh yeah there's no way that the dupers are going to let us fail, then they picked resources that no duper in their right mind would risk their account to dupe. Are they trying to bait the dupers into actively duping during the event in order to satisfy the requirements? Should have been steel lead acid and wood..
---
W  
---
T  
---
F  
---
!?!?  
---
I am confused and proud all at the same time.  
---
This is like "Task failed successfully" in a picture.
---
I don't think it's a ruse to expose dupers, what I think it is, is a time and material sink.
---
We have spent months and months gathering resources for ourselves and events like these are to deplete or stores of these materials so we spend further months in the game to gather more till the next such event arises..its all a ploy to keep us playing, gathering etc.. and keep the number of  players active
---
Fast Travel sufficiently far away, wait a bit and then back. Occasionally the CargoBot can get stuck in the terrain or some structure and this can fix it. If not, you'll probably have to give it up as bugged.
---
No budget glitching at all! Just had to be very particular with what I could and couldn’t use!
---
Ty for the information :D I was worried about having to constantly repair it but using that perk I've not had to repair it at all.
---
Would be perfect for the strip club I built across the road from wayward. I could really have my live nude ghouls
---
I don't feel like we're failing at all.
---
I not only hate them I LOATHE their entire existence.    
---
Polly is the only one but she's an NPC. The head laser thing follows you. Laser weapons are so screwed up for us to use against robots.
---
Thanks! I’m incredibly proud of this build!
---
Snag at least 3 stim packs, run around in the fire. Not hard.
---
OMG! i exactly thought the same! Beth is great in making things worse. :D
---
I'm fairly confident they don't stack. When I'm in a party with someone else sharing it I take mine off and swap it and notice no difference. 
---
The affects, however, do stack. The more mutants on your team the bigger the bonus.
---
Just server hop or start an encrypted.
---
I'm finding more often people just aren't going to events.
---
Vill souds like secret stat...
---
I am 100% in the same boat as you. I almost wish there was no voting and it was just a 50/50 on which one it would be.
---
Nah, Ammo's too expensive
---
It just activated for me last night on PS4. Not sure if there’s a trick or not, usually it’ll pop up for me daily when I fast travel to that part of the map.
---
I'm a FO1st sub too, I had 223... Not even enough for one! grinded for the last bit to at least help out a bit
---
I know I want my beret!
---
My wife also loves that scoped .44, for some reason.  LOL
---
What platform is it on? That’s quite impressive.
---
Just moved from the mire after camping there on the edge of the map for three months...now in the toxic valley, already a huge difference in the number of people passing through in just the last week. /sigh Loved that mire ambiance though.
---
Yep, Hanlon's Razor for the win.
---
I'm sure they were trying to deplete duped junk but everyone that I've seen with massive piles of the not used junk have 0 intention of turning theirs in. Probably picked cork and concrete because it's not something non-dupers have a lot of 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I’ve seen this on some pieces I’ve had before, but never used blocking in the game, so always seemed like a waste compared to others. Thanks :) I should try it hahaha
---
For the Queen specifically? Shit get it Primed (but make sure you already know how to make Ultracite plasma cartridges. The plans are STILL bugged not to teach you the ammo type. )
---
Tbh idk what you are speaking about because i have run it with 3 other people and got all three to rank 3
---
I think your tinfoil hat is on too tight. The event is actually just one of the many ruses they pull to get players to log on daily. They already know what the players have in their stash.
---
Great work then. I built a motel once with 6 rooms, 3 of them I had to lock because I ran out of budget to decorate them. Seriously only had a bed, shelf, lamp and plant in the other 3 rooms. Have no idea how you built that with how bad the budgets are! Kudos.
---
If you can go into the event with at least 4 people you know and have worked out a plan with beforehand, it can actually be really enjoyable. And has the positive side effect of leading by example/demonstrating for those who don’t know how to work the event. 
---
The first time I did it I asked several higher level friends I’d met in game how it works (because I wanted the fixer plan) and seeing it run properly in real time with people who KNEW what they were doing totally explains why it goes so horribly 90% of the time. 
---
The #1 thing I wish people understood was PROTECT YOUR CONDUITS! I’ve successfully managed the event as all 3 spamming health because the other players took turns keeping me from getting shot and also taking down the bot.
---
Or one Ghoulish card. Lasted over 4 minutes with 0 armor or meds.
---
I think the answer is more instancing / group missions / supporting group play.  (text chat would be great)
---
Because otherwise - no matter how much you tune it, zerging it becomes a reality.  How do you let me solo uranium fever, but still make it decent for 12 players showing up ?
---
I thought the whole reason we had limited stash was because of server space? Yeah, I know they also saw an opportunity to make $ with the scrap box, but thought server space was a part of the problem?
---
In addition to the answers here, refer to [this most awesome spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311) for your mod questions.
---
What a delightful mess!
---
Yep, it is :)
---
Agreed! Done to me at another event. I did all the work and minutes before it ends they show up to reap the rewards. No better than Bush Wookies
---
I loved it and grinded it up until I got lvl 100. Then I came back and grinded it when I heard they accidentally released those rewards for getting XP in the mode.
---
If they could come up with more rewards I would continue to play.
---
Had never played any BR until this one, then I was hooked and decided to try them all. None are as fun to me as this one.
---
Thanks for the suggestions.  But I know I can do those.  Even when server hopping however it feels like the event frequency has drastically changed since patch 21.  Wanted to see if others felt the same.
---
So where can you check the progress of donations?
---
I have 10k+ concrete but BoS gets none
---
I didn’t even realize Ghoulish was in NW! Good call!
---
Its almost like they want us to play this game for years buying atom shop items in the mean time
---
Additional info: I have around 2700 hrs. of playtime.  1st sub. since its inception.  Characters are levels 258, 200, 70, 58, and 56.  I play fairly casually.
---
Do you own a TS/ffr lmg? I forgot the 3rd stat lol
---
Don‘t worry! I sent the minutemen to your position!
---
(As for your problem, no clue sry)
---
Hooray!
---
You can get quite a bit from the monorail elevator, but nowhere near enough.
---
Took me a couple of tries to get it right. I needed two Stimpaks. Then I went into the storm, walked around until I was at about 25% health. Walked out of the storm, used a Stimpak. Walked back in, down to 25% again, out, Stimpak, back in, then just let myself die.
---
FYI, the SCORE was delayed in being credited, too. I didn't get it until I went into another NW match.
---
EDIT: yeah, at this point pretty much all points are worth it, because I'm level 79 and it takes more than a day to increase a level now.
---
Wait... are you actually saying you think that number is a current number? I also think we will fail btw. But you really think it has not moved in 2 days?
---
As someone also without first, plastic is good for bulking and selling the stuff you end up with.  If I'm trashing it I'd like to at least get something from it.
---
I'm actually low on plastic right now as I recently acquired a good ultracite gatling laser so I made like 20 of them to scrap for mods.  Thems ain't cheap.
---
I think cork is used for some armor mods like ultra light and stuff.  It's in golf balls along with plastic so it shouldn't be top hard to gather a fist full of.  That said, millions might be asking a bit much of people's patience for the rewards given.  Especially given the time frame.
---
WOOOOSH
---
I mean to be honest steel is REALLY plentiful and we did not know the rewards were going to suck so bad.  So I can see that we made steel with no problem.  However concrete is WAY harder to get.  I expect cork to fail even harder than concrete.  
---
Clearly the people making these challenges don't play the game or they would have realized that both concrete and cork are in short supply.
---
pretty sure 7600 hours is attained the same way no matter who you are...
---
Ahh cheers, I hadn’t came across it yet or even heard anything about it in-game
---
auto complete bug got me Friday night, its not fixed.
---
My god im 190 but im playing for like 1,5 year i think.
---
These are just goals, who said we had to get every scrap to say it was successful?
---
I've never even heard of that happening before now, to say nothing of seeing it myself. But who knows, maybe everyone I end up with is just an idiot and I'm overreacting.
---
What this now? You can still do double sided walls?
---
"the legendary vendor is a little pointless for late gamers too as some have hundreds of legendaries they already don't use. "
---
No easy feat, and required an awful lot of perspective tricks! Thankfully that prefab doesn’t take up too much budget but those billboards are murder!
---
Read it in a previous thread yesterday. Fair warning, it costs 9 points to equip.
---
I have yet to see anything with Solar after a year and a half of (albeit casual) play...I’ll have to keep an eye out for it. 
---
I’ve usually just turned the others in for scrip, but the consensus on this post seems to be saying otherwise hahaha
---
It's a Mire regional daily, IIRC, so it only pops up if and when you travel to that region. Which of the regional dailies you get is random, though, so it may actually be bugged, or RNG might simply bless you with something else to do. :-P
---
I had some one who deserved it today but I threw them and only a couple detonated what gives??
---
Nice thanks, probably still not worth it unless you a regular player for 250 points.
---
Good question. I stopped going to him. To me not worth that many caps for only 300 gold.  Do some events and dailies gets you 200 and it only costs fast travel caps if you fast travel.
---
Jesus didn't mess this up. Ask Bethesda to fix it.
---
  at the end of the westelanders mission, the game is over. REST IN PEACE FALLOUT 76
---
Shoot the face while the OP beam is charging
---
Me: okay fine I know I’m worried it’ll be buggy.., but I’m gonna buy it and play it, worst case I play it and it’s another good fallout game...
---
Me: WHERE IS THE HUD
---
OK, lol! I only have 1 character that can pull off 9 stamina. Maybe next time.
---
No it's something dupers don't have because they are stuffed full of christmas presents. The people who have the concrete Bethesda are eyeballing are the ones with unlimited junk stash space i.e. fallout 1st subscribers.  The target is probsbly based on what is already in the scrapboxes but the challenge is bullshit so no one cares.
---
If you’re a shotgun user, take any rank of enforcer and aim for the legs or the head, and you’re golden
---
Yeah, I also don’t get the Bloodied thing. Seems too risky, getting low health on purpose for some added damage. So I tend to stick with Vampires, keeps me topped up on health.
---
I hate how you need to do it in 250 chunks i mean wtf do it in 50 oor 100 but 250 a time is silly.
---
Same dude that give that to me? What are the odds lol
---
I can't even reach rank 2 on a single habitat alone lol
---
I think the rewards are the bigger issue. If the boxes had been more appealing, I'd have been gathering concrete and cork like a madman. I'm sure I'm not alone.
---
Such a small world lol! Hope you enjoy it
---
Can't keep this up with someone who doesn't bother reading. All my thoughts, including the answer to this question, are above.
---
Above and beyond the latest Bethesda drama, I simply don’t see why my character would bust his ass donating materials to the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Yeah, I did it once for the lols. Also to get that Atom challenge done. Never again. 12 levels worth of point swapping isn't worth however much score i got.
---
Regardless, I have way too many caps. Just went and offloaded a bunch of purified water and have been able buy from him twice now. I think it’s probably intentional since I read they posted a few days ago here that they were discussion bullion limits with the dev team.
---
Not really, I might play for 4 hours every couple of days. It'll still take 7600 hours but I'll be getting there years after the rest of you if at all.
---
A marathon is 42k but not everyone finishes at the same time even though they ran the same distance.
---
I'm going out for the day.   
---
$10 by the time I get back today the progress will jump to &lt; 75% complete. Fun little bet with myself.
---
The challenge is more for keeping count how long you've played for more so than actually achieving 7600 hours
---
Thanks for all this information. 
---
I did try starched genes and some mutations about a month ago (kind friend gave me a few), but ended up getting rid of them because the motion changes made me sick while playing...I’ll have to look further into ones that would cause visual changes. 
---
I tend towards ghoul dmg reductions, but have used in armour rather than perks. I found early on that the perk system is annoying without load outs, so I use more generalized cards to help me through as a whole...I should revisit them soon I’m thinking.
---
Customer *thinks* they are always right.
---
Yeah I do them because I’m still grinding Overseer rank for the NW rewards, but, for instance, my bloodied rifleman hit the 10k XP repeatable like 3 times during Path to Enlightenment sniping ghouls from the middle, which meant 300 SCORE, plus got 4 legendaries and some bullion.
---
Agreed. It pops up all the time, and is super heavy to complete. The Super Mutants drop caps, which is nice, and weapons to scrap for steel and such.
---
I only get to play a few hours a week. I donated my 250 steel and that's all the BoS is getting from me.
---
It should be pointed out to the developers yes, i suppose that is one of the more appropriate ways to hold someone to account.
---
IIRC, he’s supposed to reset around 8p EST tonight (Monday).
---
Either you got lucky, or perhaps its been changed to earlier in the day? (or someone goofed and programmed 8a instead of 8p?)
---
Is that what it is? I only seem to notice a difference when they're sharing the perk.
---
You open to tours?  I'm on XBONE and would love to stop by your place.
---
Simple question. Do you think 4.65m is the current count? I said we know it’s not. Then you started name calling. Do you think it is current or not? I’m not defending anything btw. It’s a simple question. It’s a fact it has not been updated since Saturday lol. Why dispute a fact?
---
I do like my AP refresh too...I use the Action Girl cards and consider it a bonus if a piece of armour has it too.
---
Time to get a real significant other!
---
Can’t you start an alt on your account and let him try?
---
Respect
---
I agree that they are out of touch with reality.  This was kind of a shitpost, if I'm being honest.  The general idea though was that since they can't /don't track individual players inventories that they could flag someone donating like 50 or 100k of a given item and then manually review the account for anything else that could be fishy.
---
We can do it, Reddit!
---
You can scrip em?
---
SOMEONE
---
Yeah, I went with that attempted fix first thing since my wife had gotten Rad Worms with no timer that took three disease cures to get rid of. I though maybe something was hiding, but no dice there.
---
...someone with the guts to help.
---
And your excuse for not making scrapboxes free is?
---
scrip tells you at the vending machine if youre gonna go over..
---
It does tell you about scrip. The machine's tells you you will get 0 scrip. 
---
Can't speak for the gold as I'm nowhere near 5k.
---
As of today Monday 10 of August at 11:24 am eastern time concrete is seating at 4.65 million.
---
I believe so. I could be wrong but in my personal experience there seems to be no added or lost benefit when I unequip mine as long as another is shared.
---
Gave that a go. Even went so far as stripping all my perk cards and adding them one-at-a-time and I couldn't get the damage figured out. Thanks for the suggestion anyway.
---
I know for a fact that a few individual dupers have enough to contribute a large percentage of that goal, so it seems like they're intentionally protesting it. Not like there's any value in hoarding millions of concrete. Considering this whole event is a thinly veiled attempt at siphoning out the duped resources, guess this isn't going too well
---
Maybe you could show him some of the really amazing camp builds other people have made on youtube or something?
---
with any open world base game, its all about exploring &amp; discovering the lore &amp; such, since i'm still new i don't know of alot of stuff but heard about the dungeon the burrow or so near harper ferry in the sewers. it could be something to do
---
We will fail cork as well, hahahahaha
---
I had a concrete resource node in my camp, and I still only managed 2k since i set it up sometime last year.
---
Only 700 cork.
---
You'll never get through their sea of cork!
---
Perhaps a slight change in the way the event was set up instead of individual  resources maybe just group the whole lot together over the month and just have it like a kickstarter strech goal bar I could spare a metric s**t ton of cloth and steel but cork and concrete I might be able to spare 1 donation.
---
At least you can cut is DPS with ricochet, an ass-aultron cut you down if you're unprepared and that's not even because they work properly, the fact they charge the laser so often and so quickly is legit a bug.
---
Yeah. I asked if it did work with gold bullion items because I was wondering if it did would the legendary effects re-roll or be the same but it’ll play the sound but nothing will happen.
---
Sorry, I was still dailies mode and thinking about receiving scrip while completing quests. You’re right about the vending machine.
---
The fact that you even care about the event is the reason we are doomed.
---
Come on by any you see me online! GT is HeroKunning!
---
if clean toilet is not in this season, then a clean tub or shower better be in.  It's my hope one bathroom item is in every season.
---
Cloth won't be an issue at all. It's only use, aside from CAMP stuff is what... Gunpowder? XP grinders have plenty from farming super mutants so cloth just gets chucked in the stash with everything else.
---
I use the Action Girl cards, and definitely notice a difference when I’m without armour that has it too...priority since early levels. For weight reduction I’ve maxed out my Perk cards for chems, junk, etc- do you find it better to use through armour? Or do you use both?
---
They could have kept the same materials but just adjusted the quantities to something more realistic.  Make the "big ask" be steel rather than the thing they need the least of.
---
We've been asking Bethesda the same question every day.
---
You will have to add them to your friends list in the game as well. I don't play on Xbox but I imagine they need to be your friend in the game not just on Xbox
---
You’re better off with what you have than Vanguards. SS+Buttressed will already put you well over the armor soft cap, Vanguards will barely do anything even when you are at full health and turn even more useless as you go down. I run 2x lifesaving and mixed Troubleshooter’s/mutant slayer/ghoul slayer on the rest.
---
Oh ya, never meant it'd mean making the challenge. Just, you know ... FYI if you need stuff.
---
I guess it will works like Foundation and Crater NPCs, NPCs in the bases is invincible but the one spawns in encounters is killable
---
His tweet has a winky face. It's probably sarcasm.
---
The other big location I'm aware of is Abandoned Cranberry Bog Town (the one with the workshop).  The shop makes concrete and there are also like a dozen+ bags in the second floor of the brick building by the shop and in the shanty town area.
---
A bit under 1k steel, about 50 concrete, and maybe 30 cork.  Didn’t know there was a ”minimum donation” so when I stopped by to drop some concrete and discovered they wanted 250 at a time - Beggars should not be choosers, but I had no choice other than walk away.
---
Freind of mine (with FO1st) had stupid large amounts of all 3, but with unlimited junk storage, it didn’t really matter.
---
I haven’t contributed at all. The rewards are so lacklustre I didn’t see the point
---
Yikes
---
Sort by weight is useful although not perfect.
---
East coast us got hit with a tropical storm.  Northeastern states also, depending on coverage, may also have gotten double whammied with an mass showing of incompetence on the part of the electric service provider.  
---
To put into prospective.  Half of my state was basically out of power.  On day one, I was all over the state for various forms of business.  Saw not one truck from the utility company.
---
We also have a light heat wave, but nothing crazy imo.  At least not here specifically where I am.
---
But yeah I just got back after almost a week.  Missed several dailies and ate up most of my leading cushion.
---
Silly English Kuhhhhh-niggits
---
That was pretty much just an excuse for why they couldn’t increase stash. This was a part of the outrage when they release fo1st because we thought they were doing it due to actual constraints, but instead it was because they wanted to make money off of it.
---
The pipe weapons make some sense, since there a prewar magazine about The Streets Guns of Detroit that shows a pipe gun on the cover, suggesting they were improvised weapons made by desperate citizens trying to protect themselves during riots or civil unrest, etc. 
---
Maybe the robots killed a diseased creature and the rotting flesh is stuck to their claws/appendages, depending on the model?
---
Scorched robots..,I dunno.
---
What about the Foundation too?
---
The only vendor I found to have the gated doors was the Supermutant Graham and it's not always listed when you do finally find him. There is a spawn point by the Charleston RR station vendor. Run past the railroad vendor and start to cross the red RR bridge. Stop and turn around about midway. The spawn point is in the farmer's field adjacent to the station. If an enemy spawns, just server hop. It took me about 5 tries before Graham showed up with Moo Moo. 2 things to note: 1) If someone has their camp there, the spawn won't work. Some put their camps there because of the somewhat flat land there. 2) Those doors can be glitchy at times.
---
Definitely! Since it most often appears when receiving AoE damage (rads, fire, poison, etc) it will occur more often than not in the nuke zone then all that flux goes to waste. At least, BGS should unlabel stable flux as Junk - it's far from being junk and is one of the most useful items there is. At least then we'd only lose "true" junk to this bug for a start.
---
I think that's what FO1st is for. I have a route I use which takes about 2 hours for me to do my LR dailies and once this legendary run is over I'm going to start doing more of the events.  I've never done project Paradise or the cryptid one with the pylons, and I've still got loads of side missions left from the main game. as I've been holding off completing them as I knew one wasteland was coming
---
Have a vacation planned to my beach house for a few weeks.  So bought the remaining 50 tiers as I eont be able to do them while I'm away ( no internet, yada yada)
---
New armour, weapons, mods, camp items. I don't think there are any side quests as a result of completing the raid.
---
You need to go back to lost hills in fallout 1. It's the banner out front.
---
I think they're trying to deplete our scrap reserves so we've gotta grind resources when SHELTERS come out.
---
I agree that junk sink is the primary goal of the event.  The ruse bit was mostly shitposting and me hoping for some kind of a silver lining to an otherwise poorly planned event.
---
Solar is not an effect - it’s an armor set. Originally available from the Vault 94 raids, you can buy the plans with bullion now.
---
its an in game timer yo.. 
---
the mistake they made was having it be even remotely achievable...
---
Im sure they were loling when they rolled up the reward 
---
its baffling that people think its a real challenge
---
If you take the workshop at Bogtown there are three resource spots to farm concrete. Now as stated a few minutes ago, I'm not implying this could ever be sufficient to make the ludicrous BOS challenge of 150 whatevers, but, it's handy if you are building your own CAMP
---
Some "things" will cry for female rights, "materialize female" or something
---
The Whitespring had a pre war promotion where they accepted caps thanks to a deal with Nuka Cola, so at least the Whitesprings makes sense. Maybe the other factions copied them since pre war money is worthless?
---
The concrete is due today, I believe. It was the 8th-11. 😅
---
Oh haha- that explains why then. Thanks!
---
It's not a fail if we don't care....
---
Yuuuuuuuup
---
IMO, Sneak at max  rank is essential unless you like going all Rambo.    
---
Fix It Good and Weapon Artisan max for repairing gear. Not sure what perks do that for PA.    
---
All Rifleman perks maxed. Long Shot Rank 1. Concentrated Fire Rank 1.    
---
If you plan on using a lot of Chems then Traveling Pharmacy or get the Chemist backpack mod when you get to that point and swap out that Perk for something else.    
---
For my main who is a sniper non PA user I have Starched Genes, Class Freak, Bloody Mess, and Super Duper at max. Scrounger Rank 1 for extra ammo and Tormentor.    
---
I have never played Heavy Weapons so I can't post anything about that.
---
I had fo1st for two months . All my concrete I saved I used for camp building. There’s no way I would have concrete in my already full inventory . I think I have 50  at most. Without fallout 1st this grind isn’t do able. My character is already over loaded with weapons . I play a lot of fo76 , I avoid looting junk since I have a full inventory . Theses events are meant to fail or push you to pay for fallout 1st.
---
i kinda doubt they even bother to care unless it will effect the atom shop or make people stop using 1st.
---
I think the 2 double xp sessions helped, plus I've been stacking Lover's Embrace, Canned Stew and the Mothman bonus as often as possible. Then there are lunchboxes. It seems like if I pop one at the SBQ a few others will too, and all of a sudden 100% xp bonus. For what it's worth I have 27 rank ups that I haven't used yet because I don't really have anything to use them on. I am working from home as well, so it's kind of easy for me to jump on every day to do my dailies.
---
Have you ever asked yourself why the recently released Sleazy Heart Bed is child-sized?
---
It is, but scrap isn't the big contributing factor. Weapons and armor are. The game has to store and recall a TON of information about each weapon and piece of armor both in your inventory and in your stash.
---
Who the hell mass duped concrete and cork though?  They don't have a lot of utility I'm aware of, especially concrete...  I can buy this idea for things like steel (used in just about everything) and plastic (lots of utility use for bulking and used for Secret Service rolls), but cork?  C'mon.
---
For the first time I liked wastelanders. Couple of alts running these quests I got really bored too. But I *had* to do it to get them gold bullions.
---
you have to place one wall. then use a flame trap to break it. then place another wall facing the opposite way. Then repair the first. so you essentially have to build 3 walls to get one double sided wall.
---
and you have to repair one of them at a tinker's bench.
---
Well I got out ahead. I put all of my concrete for sale for 5 caps a piece and got cleared out as soon as I logged on, lol. That shit is worth more in caps than anything Bethesda can give me.
---
I’m actually really happy about it. I think the BOS are a bunch of blowhards . I refuse to help them . Don’t worry , I’m sure the banner will be on the atomic shop or a free item to 1st members
---
Floaters... and Assaultrons.
---
I saw someone placed their camp module right in the middle of the clearing behind V9. However there were no structures at all. It was the guy running the silos. 
---
So he basically sacrificed having a personal camp so he could make it impossible to place fo1st tents to stand on. So genius in a way.
---
I don't think Butcher's Bounty or Green Thumb do anything in this event. I tried Butcher's Bounty a long time ago and didn't receive more meat from the radstags.
---
Angry Turtle recently reported that he managed to finish all three areas with a minute to spare. It's possible the event was changed so that it's easier to acquire materials. I didn't manage to confirm this myself, however. I only tried the event once since update 21, and every other player seemed to be following me instead of moving to separate areas.
---
While I agree that people are lazy with this event (the worst are the people that just hide in stealth the whole time until the alpha shows up), the event is easily doable with four people and can be done with three experienced players. You can also keep one alive solo and complete the event provided you have a high DPS ranged weapon. Also the last patch appears to have stealth nerfed it. You now usually get two pieces of the farmable material most of the time which is nice.
---
I would love to see them make the event triggerable like Encryptid so you could have teams do it regularly though. Now you just have to get on a server and hope it shows up.
---
A few tips:
---
- Don't mess the Formula Q side quest unless you need the backpack. It makes the event harder because the friendly animals will attack other mobs and get destroyed by the alpha. 
---
-Green thumb doesn't do anything on this event
---
-Habitat B is the easiest to solo. If everyone is in A, go to B. Habitat C is the hardest because the kelp spawns are inconsistent and the anglers can be a pain.
---
-Clear out the robots while the timer ticks before you start the event. This helps and make it easier and gives players time to show up.
---
-Kill the alpha from scaffolding with the highest dps weapon you have. They can't do much damage to you up there. Also sometimes you can get the Grafton Monster stuck in the furnace area if you can lure him in there.
---
I buy a few modules or vault steel when it starts getting close
---
Will do. GT is FunsterMunster.   I'm EST, so it wouldn't be till later today after work.  I'll use my character where I built my version of the Last Plank from Far Harbor.  You could check that out.  My little prize build.  Your build looks awesome.
---
Yeah I had it happen last week as did a friend I was in chat with on discord at the time. We both got screwed out of 1250 score that day and it made us both just say screw it to that day. Went and played other games.
---
Yeah.  
---
They could 'claim' the tracker is messed up and a 'fix' suddenly shows we did it. The numbers are simply TOO HIGH. I've barely used Concrete and my CAMP is small despite my char being level 100.
---
The punk is just too annoying to keep around in my camp.
---
Or a very select few of them duped concrete as it isn’t a fundamental material.
---
Can confirm similar situation on PC. Oddly it depends on where in the area you are.
---
Plasma caster needs a VATS-centric crit build to work properly. I managed to roll a B/25/25 one and built around that. Unyielding is great for the extra stats, but for PA, run the Carnivore mutation and Strange in Numbers, then eat a ton of scorchbeast parts for huge AGI/LCK buffs, and add in other recipes for max AP and regen.
---
There are concrete extractor spots in the world. Abandoned Bog Town workshop has 3 spots for them. It's slow and they cap at 40 so even letting all 3 fill up once will only get you half a donation.
---
Stash space is limited because each *different* item in there needs to have a record in a database. (and I assume that is designed or coded pretty poorly since plenty of games have much bigger databases online with no issues)  But  having 10 or 100 of the *same* item does not require a different record, it just requires a different 'quantity' listed.  So they always could have given everyone a scrapbox with no problem, they just wanted it to be a premium, paid item.  For that matter, they could also give unlimited chems and ammo in the stash if they wanted to, but they clearly don't want to.
---
Meh. I am not moving my camp. Bog town has a few spots and it’s pretty easy to farm 20+ bags of concrete over just 3 locations on a server.
---
Pictures or it didn't happen.
---
Well, my business I run from home. At this point, it mostly runs itself.
---
I only play for 3 to 4 hours a day, really. I log in with every character to turn in the Vital Equipment daily and 150 scrip at the purveyor. Each week, I buy my 300 gold on the 15 characters I've finished the wastelanders questline with. I'm working on the other 5.
---
It takes most of my time just to knock out the daily challenges for my SCORE. That's something I won't do next time around, though. The only other thing I do is hop around on one of my characters to buy up as many cheap legendaries for scrip for all of my characters to be able to turn in their 150 a day. I use private servers and 2 computers to easily transfer scrip legendaries and caps off of my main vendor characters. 
---
I typically log into all 4 accounts to group with myself to share perks and take advantage of everyone having Empath. I also hop all of them to certain events to get legendaries from proximity kills. Horde events with melee mobs are best, but only really on a private server so I can farm them for a couple of hours without someone killing the main Legendary Enemy. 
---
When I play on public servers, I run the accounts that have my vendors on them.
---
Most of my characters are at 100 or so, with a few near 200, and two over 250.
---
It probably sounds like a lot, and it was definitely some effort to get to where I am, but the system I use now is very easy to maintain.
---
To be honest your feat is greater than mine. Try hitting a fly in real life.
---
Nope, just carefully placed colored bulbs, matter of fact I tried the boxes but sadly it had poor brightness.
---
Uhoh I guess my alts are gonna be poor again today.
---
Dammit!
---
Does Cork counter Plasma bolts?! I guess the BoS posse did not skip the sciense class...
---
I’ll definitely take a peek!
---
TIL:  Left bumper does it by percent of bar, so I hold that to get close.
---
I must have used up all my good fortune because I have a 3* Berserker Grognak Axe dropped on me several months ago but can't find a Junkie Fixer or Handmade in many, many hours of gameplay. :(
---
My favorite is when I 1 shot them while they are charging and they still manage to slap me while they are going down.
---
100% for sure had the bug happen like 5 days ago to myself and a friend and no it wasn't just "they were check marked but I could still do them". One was our level up daily which we both leveled and got no score as it was already counted as "complete".
---
Today is the 10th for the American continents.
---
If you tell me about a non resource intensive program to make a clip with, I'll make one and post it here the next time I play \^\^
---
I forgot about flame traps! Thank you!
---
Ah you're right that's my bad now 😅
---
Concrete updated yesterday. I know this because it showed 0 and I refreshed it a few hours later and it showed 4.65m.
---
If only the duppers actually did something good for the communtiy for once...
---
Now where's the deep pocketed!
---
Don't think it's that, they made the rewards so garbage that people like me who have the plans and no need for the extra little things won't even bother, I beat the legendary run and basically now only get on on tuesdays for the atom shop reset in hopes for something cool. Nothing they have has incentivized me to play daily since I don't need score anymore.
---
I spent 24k caps today with smiley.
---
So, when we fail the concrete challenge, we fail the cork and plastic ones automatically, right?  
---
Otherweise the whole Project Alpha thing and the graphic on the event site (Steel -&gt; Concrete -&gt; Cork -&gt; Plastic) would not make any sense. So i guess the next things i'll donate are wood and cloth.
---
Show him the joys of hoarding.
---
"Well, I dont know, just give it some number!"
---
"Okay, geez, what about this?"
---
"Yeah, lovely, whatever. That's fine."
---
Are you suggesting that the BOS sigil will come to the Atom shop if the event fails?  You're probably not wrong.
---
Nice ... I might try do that.
---
It’s expensive to craft, and the plans are expensive as well. But damn, those 4hp/s for you AND every teammate around you is like a constant stimpak. It also stacks, so if multiple teammates are running it you can get some insane heals for just standing around.
---
I mean, it's probably bait but my point still stands.
---
Hah yeah, I have emptied my caps reserves several times now. Before I spend any more I’m going to wait to receive word that this was intentional on Bethesda’s behalf.
---
I'd settle for a picture with you just standing over a death claw bare handed lmaooooo.
---
I'd rather see it in the atomic shop and not have to listen to all these mouthbreathers who think the BoS are fascists whine all day about a fallout 1 reference.
---
Haha it did feel pretty epic. Was in NW and had to kill a creature and as usual I had no weapons.
---
That *has to be* a typo from Bethesda. 760 hours became 7600.
---
Don't do those quests yet. Stay in the forest and toxic Valley. Explore, do side quests in those regions, do events, claim workshops. Level up where there are enemy's your level
---
Well do you prefer guns or melee
---
They're adding interiors true, but I doubt they're doing away with the current exterior building mechanics 
---
Plus I doubt most players are going to bother checking out the inside of other people's camps, so the exterior is still going to be the focus for the builder mains lol
---
man that could just be fabricated though
---
Just an incentive to run into the fire: you can find additional supply boxes outside the game play area in the fire. Found 3 boxes with stone guns and armor in the fire this morning. Made it easy to get the 1 min and get back into the game.
---
They were probably going to thematically appropriate amounts. After all, the faction isn't called the Brotherhood of Cork for nothing!
---
it works with the scrapbox because the server only has to remember specific things and how many of each of those items you have. The stash takes up more resources because there are hundreds of different items that could be in it. I feel the MISC section of my inventory with all the different duplicate keys probably takes up more server resources.
---
So thats it, just the gold quest?
---
Thought there'd be more side quests,
---
Anyway is there more to come do you think? because I was thinking of selling my xbox. 
---
I only played fallout really.
---
Lol that last line got me good
---
I believe that, though the base fist damage is much higher than I thought it is
---
They will take his guns
---
I got a few on my profile if you wanna trade for it lol gl
---
Those are all older weapons so as they go forward my guess is that we will see a lot more untradible weapons
---
*BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL IDENTIFIED*
---
Thanks that’s what I needed to know.
---
I don't doubt you  i was being sarcastic
---
We havnt got them in our stockpile but they do sell bulk cork and concrete at the npc vendors, if it isn't just a sink of our resources it's also to deplete the amount of caps players have available and in the world
---
Lode Bearing. Again?! Pass.
---
If it's flying, it's a scorched beast... they will stop chasing eventually.
---
Burrowing, mole rats or scorpions, you're F-ed.
---
One way to reduce those encounters is to sneak while moving through higher level areas. The HIDDEN will goto CAUTIOUS is something detects you, but hasn't aggro-ed yet. So if you see CAUTIOUS, then stop, look around, and use VATS to try and target what has spotted you. You can then exit out of VATS and see what level it is and decide to move away while sneaking to drop the CAUTIOUS.
---
Many people use VATS as a way to scout around. Look in a direction, hit VATS, see if anything is there.
---
didn't think you did, you just got me thinking that a clip of it would probably be way cooler
---
And people said our contributions didn't matter and the numbers were false. Actually kind of funny and I'm very interested in seeing bethesda respond to this.
---
Or you can also free aim 🤷‍♂️
---
All I care about is that their repetitive dialogue is not annoying, Becket seems the way to go in this regard
---
Most areas have enemies that scale with your level. The problem for you is that a high level players "spawned" higher level enemies by going near that area. Try to hop to another server a few times. (staying near that location while doing so might help getting lower level enemies since the game consider you're lvl 1 when you just logged in)
---
I like the earning it factor, but getting a Bloodied FFR Gauss Minigun when you don't run Bloodied is kinda crummy. Cool, I got a very in demand weapon, it now either sits in my inventory and takes up weight while contributing to lag, or I feel like a monster and feed it to the scrip dispenser.
---
That's the BOS that takes over later after an internal power struggle. This is a very young and very new BOS still run by the idealism of the founders - basically this BOS is Best Buy with power armor.
---
There's a glitch out where if you exit the wayward and go back in you can buy more gold, it's on YouTube as of this morning.
---
I mean, the Collectron might be good. And the other Collectrons don’t collect scrap; they can collects chems and alchohol, proletariat (forget what it gives), revolutionary (Chinese swords, blood packs, other stuff), Xmas gifts, and the Faschnacht one...no idea what that collects because I missed a few months of gameplay due to my crappy satellite internet.
---
I’d consider moving some perks around or help your desired secondary skill.
---
I’m melee/rifle (15 Str, 13 Per), with a touch of heavy (Stabilized3).  
---
I got a TSE handmade From Fashnacht.   Does ok using the scope, but hip fire is wildly inaccurate.
---
My fav rifle is an explosive suppressors lever action.  Good hipfire and even better scoped.  (Class freak does a reasonable job of offsetting the accuracy reduction from twisted muscles.)
---
Do you not have a massive surplus of legendaries? I literally give away or drop 10-20 of them a day (when I run out of scrip and stash space for the vending machine).
---
I support this suggestion. I'd actually bother collecting concrete just to see stripper poles light up the CAMPS across the Wasteland. 
---
Especially with some of the outfits I've seen allies dressed in. That would be gold.
---
way too much materials for this event.
---
PS4 here... Is your Sony ID the same as on here? (And yes... I am female. 😂)
---
There was a green dress in the atom shop once I believe. That was belted.
---
Pretty much run unyielding secret service armor at this point. But have some special sets, chameleon, ghoul slayer's, mutant slayer's, troubleshooters, etc. Use Troubleshooters the most out of those though.
---
Scrap in this game is basically currency that has no cap to the amount you can collect (if you have fallout 1st.)
---
I've traded stacks of scrap like 10k for awesome gear.
---
Everyone is maxed caps, but no one is max scrap.
---
I've got enough steel to rebuild liberty prime 100 times over, but it's bullets to feed my gun and currency to trade with. I'm not giving it away.
---
If they made it donate caps I could get on board with that...
---
You can blueprint stuff for workshops
---
Exactly this! They can't even make a patch work right. What makes anyone think they would have multiple versions of something huge like that? Besides, the BOS stuff won't release on schedule. They will delay all of it until next year.
---
The limited stash is for all the other shit. All the unique weapons, armor, clothing/cosmetics, etc. All that stuff can pile up when there are a lot of them and they decided to use weight as a general limitation for it.
---
The scrapbox does allow for people to have more of that stuff, but the scrapbox and it's contents on it's own doesn't hit the server much more than the normal stash. They could probably also make an ammo box and an aid box and it would largely be the same as well since there are finite numbers of those in game. The issue is unique stuff that doesn't stack.
---
However, imo, a limited stash works better for a survival game anyway, if you have unlimited resources, you participate less in the survival aspects of the game, so, to me, the scrapbox is kind of an antithesis to the design of a survival game.
---
I still cannot figure out where sheepsquatch spawn lol
---
They relativity recently got buffed to fuck, they never used to do so much damage.....
---
Concrete is fine, it makes sense as a material that would be needed. Its just why do they need so damn much of it?! 5 million is a perfectly reasonable goal and more than enough to make their (the bos) shitty fortress. And if im not mistaken we were pretty much at the mark as of yesterday.
---
I saw like 2 frames in silo alpha last night.  I would guess that by the time people are in the silos, they have most of what they want and leave the pa frames alone except in the rare case that they want a new frame for something.
---
When I was building my t65 shortly after wastelanders, I couldn't find a frame for days before I finally found one in watoga.  Checked all the spawns too.  Just none there until it was.
---
Raiders have stolen our water cooled home saw
---
Bummer
---
Same as SBQ, 58, I believe. 58 for the ghouls.
---
Edit: wording to match question
---
Lol this is hilarious.
---
Wait is it my turn already?
---
*goes back to playing Fallout Shelter: The Board Game*
---
I for one certainly hope so..
---
Ive been very disappointed in the number of protected NPCs so far.. 
---
I was hoping to be able to shoot many more of them in the face to death than the game actually allows
---
Ahh damnit so this is a glitch? I thought this may have been intentional. I read in here that they were considering changing the limits so who knows.
---
That would explain the events ending quickly.  But I'm talking about them not firing.  Since I have the notifications turned on for all public events.
---
Someone looks at the date, sees the pre-determined count for that day, updates the counter.
---
Unarmed mele build. Two shot them.
---
Given the crate rewards, I think the minimum amount should have been much lower.  Like 50 or 100.  Maybe even as low as a single bulked junk resource since the plans are most beneficial to newer players (not implying you are new).  Before I had 1st, I think my "stock" was similar to you.  Generally no more than 60 of any junk that I didn't use frequently.
---
Dude that's the goal.  They all come with a low percent core that I dont want so when theres one with no core that I can take score.  I can make a new set for the collection.
---
Edit.  I'm too lazy to drop it.
---
Haha, nope not intentional at all! There will probably be bans as well since the gold system is Bethesdas baby, so be careful.
---
Who wonders, is steel THE resource you can come by easily and in masses with playing events like radiation rumble and uranium fever... but concrete? CORK!? to repeat a much asked question: DO the devs play their own game!?
---
Sounds like you probably want heavy guns or commando.
---
Heavy guns are loud, so no sneaking involved.
---
Command benefits from sneaking due to having silenced weapons available, but still do decent damage without.
---
Melee is also an option, but you can struggle on some things due to flying or it being just plain dangerous to be close to the enemy.
---
Same!  I initially harbored the hope that we'd get a full set of clean bathroom fixtures this season, but 'twas not to be.
---
IMO they should start a new community event called "bring back the FUN" where you must collect whatever they ask you to and, if we manage to do it, Bethesda fix all the bugs we listed here a countless time already ... just to show them what we really really want and how hard we want it. Couldn't care less about hunting for concrete when the VATS bug is killing my ammunation stock. How are people even coping with that using ultracite ammo?
---
I've only been here for a month and they accumulated the catastrophes and what's coming for the game in the near future isn't appealing at all. How about a freaking ingame chat so people can actually socialize with other players? (I can't use a mic)
---
I think it would be cool if we could get legendary modules back if we scrap our SS armor and other items we cannot get rid of easily.
---
Thanks for posting these dude. Really cool to see something different.
---
BoS theme with Enclave rewards bwahaha
---
Stipper pole, I'm in!!!
---
It's a glitch and you can buy it over and over again
---
The Lucille's Lullaby skin looks pretty much the same whenever it pops up in the shop. That way you can slap it on a legendary minigun if you're wanting to actually use one.
---
Green thumb and butchers bounty don’t do anything in project paradise.  
---
Getting all 3 to max level is easy enough if u have a decent build and know what ur doing.  
---
Me and my mates can easily do 1 room each ourselves and fill to max.
---
You see you eventually get strong enough that assaultrons become manageable. But molerats? Molerats are spawned straight from satan's asshole and defy logic by burrowing through second story floors. You basically cannot prevent being bitten by at least one of them in a group and guess what, that one bite has a 99% chance to disease you!
---
Fuck those assholes.
---
I am talking about blueprinting entire workshops, not individual parts.
---
I would be okay if the donations pushed me along this stupid space race board game event they have going on.
---
Honestly would be sweet release
---
I would honestly take anything other than the system we have now
---
/thread lol
---
50 isnt expensive enough to pick your own rolls IMO..
---
It would need to be much more expensive than that.. stupidly expensive...
---
so expensive you could only really even do it once or maybe twice ever...
---
Well thanks for telling me about the legs. I usually shoot the arms and make it self destruct
---
Lol don’t even have to unblock them to know who you’re talking to. No bother dealing with this guy. He just likes arguing math on posts without provided logic on why your own logic is wrong other than “there’s better ways” that he never actually explains.
---
Just argumentative. He doesn’t have anything to add to your post.
---
I've run it successfully three times with one other person, not with all three habitats, but it can be done with two people. Alone, I can get a level 2 friendly in A(the yao guai), and I'm not exactly sure that the perks even work in there. I think that in a year and a half playing this game, I've only been in a fully completed event 1 time, and there was about 6 or 8 people there.
---
I just ran it this morning and collected 50 venison by myself, I've done it a few times by myself and gotten to where the alpha shows up. I nearly managed to kill the alpha once through with my friendly still alive. I feel like eventually, I will manage to keep my friendly alive and slaughter the alpha that shows up, someday.
---
I go to that event every time I see it pop up, it's a good xp source and typically generates at least 3 legendaries not counting the alpha. But, as you mention, no one else shows up to do it. I had a full public team this morning, went to the event, and gave the 'help' and 'follow me' emotes...nothing from my team. Eventually another guy showed up, but by then my bear was dead and the remaining bloatfly got killed quickly. 
---
The thing that is literally the worst about this event, and many other instances in this game, is what appears to be a 'surprise mechanic' at work in this game where mobs seem to spawn out of nowhere around the player sometimes. I got steamrolled by a yao guai, and there went my friendly yao guai as well since I couldn't immediately respawn, and when I did, I was on the other side of the  lab. 
---
When I get there early enough, I just assume no one else is going to show up, so I go work on Habitat-A with the randstags. I go kill the assaultron on the gantry that is over the trough. I kill the sentry bot, I trigger all of the pods to generate the robots and kill them, then I take out whatever ghouls are hiding around the habitat. That lets me focus on all of the mobs when filling the troughs. If I manage to not get killed here, I can usually get at least 40-50 venison in the trough. It seems like sometimes that the randstags don't generate as quickly, and I can only get enough for Squishy, the glowing wolf.
---
reminds me when I built a huge island fortress in Minecraft. The outside looked like it was made of sand, stone, and brick, but the entire inside was filled with wood because it literally grows on trees.
---
Also Fastnacht ... But yeah, I guess maybe there haven't been 2 going.  But I'll swear there has been.  I DO know that I've been in the midst of one event, when another one fires.   Which is probably where I'm getting my '2 events' thing.     
---
But that's kinda the thing.  I used to be able to be in one event (say, Heart of the Swamp), and before it ended see Radiation Rumble fire up.   So I could finish up the Heart, fast travel to my camp to de-junk &amp; re-equip, and then pop over and join the Rumble which others had started.   (and then before it ended, something else would appear).  etc.
---
This event was to get a free banner. The banner will be available for sale so you will still be able to have it.
---
Ooo different glitch? I dont use glitches ( except photo mode through lock doors cuz I'm to lazy to switch perks) so I'm a little outta the loop
---
This is high on our priority list. It's pretty complicated to address but they are working hard towards finding a solution for this.
---
I play about 1 hour a day doing just the dailies and weeklies. I am rank 99 as of 8/10/20 at 10:45 cst. When the dailies reset at 11 AM central, I will complete them and obtain the remaining 2900 points for rank 100. I will have completed the season with a month and one week to spare. Hardly unattainable.
---
Most materials are faster to loot than a WS can produce.
---
I capture the workshop for plans nad challenges, but leave the area when the captrue has completed.
---
If you want to do the defend event, you can defend most workshops from NPC invaders from outside the zone if you have a decent sniper rifle.
---
At a certain point it's best to avoid the main questlines and level yourself up before proceeding.  Do events, dailies, or farm xp on west half of map until you're strong enough. If you have 1st take a bunch of workshops. The constant "defend workshop" events and the mobs that come with them will level you very quickly early.
---
&gt;Thrill of the Grill
---
That's a Daily Quest.  Not a public event.
---
Oh I hope so! I will not allow the BoS tech raiders to disrupt our little...
---
Enclave.
---
I really wish more people were brave enough to mention this.
---
thats what killed it for me. Nothing in game telling me how we're doing.
---
They could claim they weren't updating over the weekend
---
It probably is, and the statement will trigger a lot of people. But, I agree with you.
---
The rest of my statement was directed at the OP. I wouldn't know about another player's sexual preferences unless they made it a point to say it. And then, I still wouldn't give a damn.
---
I would be pretty pissed if I got banned for buying gold from smiley because the game let me do so. That would be ridiculous, I’m not exploiting the game in any way. Like I said in my other post, I’m going to hold off on buying more gold until we get word from Bethesda though.
---
It's only a guess, I can't think of any other possible reason they would have such a ludicrous amount of resources required.

Oh jeez this is a glitch? They better not ban me as I had no idea. I thought this is how this vendor worked?
---
Imagine the BoS update implementing a bug where the FO launcher would uninstall itself.... nvm that’s a bit far fetched
---
I really wanted that damn banner too!
---
I hope so 🤞🏻
---
This is more sad than the idea that it's a ruse
---
Thanks :)
---
Eeeeh, part of it also comes from the same issue anytime your trying to use the ammo converter, or selling things to a vendor. Sometimes what you have "selected" after selling an item, isnt the next item on the list, but the previous, because the game is weird with the way it reloads/refreshes interfaces 
---
And when you have to do it 100 times in one sitting, going slow just kills the desire to even do it at all, and by extension, even bother logging in
---
And golf balls at Whitespring/Hemlock Holes
---
I would pay 50 modules just to guarantee a 3* peice at this point I crafted 4 today and the rolls were 1* regenerating 1* goul slayers 2* hunters +endurance and 1* zealots its fucking crazy
---
Iron sights are the way if you use chameleon or stealth suit imo.
---
and that’s awesome! unfortunately, not everyone is like that though. i’ve had nothing but bad experiences with men that i’ve met through gaming and i’m just trying to chill and have a good time. it sucks, i’d love to have some guy friends too but unfortunately being threatened with rape and violence for being trans has left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth and i’d rather not even mess with it. women tend to be a lot more understanding and supportive which is why i asked for girls to play with.
---
Damn.i know it is rng but I had real bad luck on my 1st 10 that I crafted.no unyielding..I started to craft them at the same work bench  and every time I craft 10 I get at least 1-3 star unyielding. Some say crafting as whitesprings is lucky for them.i rolled about 60 piece's and though not god rolls all 3 star unyielding from the workbench behind the westeck mountain  where there is a shack attached to a big rig with a bed in the truck.maybe I'm just lucky?
---
At this point I'll take it, just to get my treasury notes.  And lots of nice shooting to do to get some XP, and picking up miner scrap.
---
Much better IMO than some of them like the canning one.  Where you sit around for 30 minutes while slowly killing low level mobs.   Or meditation, where usually after the first two groups of enemies, I see nothing else and just sit there idle for like 15 minutes waiting for the event to complete.
---
I had no idea that people would pay that much for the fixer plan. I just got my second one and was trying to figure out how much to price it in my vendor.  Personally I would rather get a lot of stable flux.
---
I like them, I enjoy dangerous enemies that don't run. You know what really sucks? Molerats and scorchbeasts, because it's just a lot of waiting. Molerats love to burrow, and scorchbeasts love to swoop around and never land.
---
Weekend before last, I bought 6k caps worth of bullion on sunday. Then, they changed smiley's reset schedule last tuesday. On a hunch, I went to see smiley that day and was able to buy another 6k caps worth. I had just assumed they had reset him as a necessary part of the update. A one time extra purchase of bullion for the week. But from what I'm reading, does this mean he can be bought from multiple times due to a bug?
---
They acknowledged it's missing but should have been added and of course never said when it will be fixed. Maybe Tuesday if we're lucky, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
I’ve never had much concrete to begin with lol and I’ve been playing on and off since day one, maybe FO1st members can contribute but not me sadly.
---
I hope the event low key fails so Bethesda realizes how poorly designed this event is. I was a little surprised that we completed the steel one, but then I remembered that steel is like the most abundant scrap item in the game. Some of these others will fail miserably.
---
Only chance this gets done is if some duper’s meet up and crank out metric fucktons of concrete.
---
I’ve only ever gotten 2 Unyeilding ones and they were both one star
---
Pretty sure it was "patched" but it was the classic god mode glitch that resulted from dying in a specific and fantastic way.
---
Once you respawn you were invulnerable and any effects you had would not be removed.  So you could equip and unequip unyielding armor to stach the bonus to cap and then go full health and keep the bonus.  Infinite leader bobblehead stacking.  Raking in tons of xp.  
---
As another above said, I'm pretty sure that those people got banned as most of them completed the legendary run on the second day, which is clearly not attainable in any legitimate capacity.
---
Even the grindiest of grinders took a couple weeks I'm pretty sure.
---
What did they expect, the prizes SUCK!!  Reskined Christmas presents and a shitty pole, yeah I'm gonna waste my junk on that.   Cant wait for cork. Dont know about you, buy I dont have alot of it so why would I donate it
---
Why would you want to beautify a workshop?
---
Checking in &amp; agreeing: rolled well over 100 chests before I got an unyielding one, and damn near 90 to get an unyielding right leg. Got the other three (granted they are shit--1 one star and 1 two star and a 3 star increased durability) within about 30 rolls for the other three. 
---
This is assinine.
---
Sexual assaultrons still touching wastelanders and getting away with it. The Kevin Spacey’s of fallout
---
This event is yet another example of how Bethesda developers don't play their own game.   Farming 150 million concrete in three days?  That's just... so absolutely ridiculous. The supply of concrete is on the map is extremely limited.  If they played the game they would know this.
---
Maybe the actual numbers for the items were s last minute change?
---
Like, they had all these assets lined up, but then someone from marketing/management walked in and was like "oh boy, I'm sure the players will pay a ton for this bundle in the atom shop"
---
So they had to find a way to tank the event to please marketing
---
I mean, it wouldnt be the first time things like this have happened in an online game
---
If you knew that any other currency had a limit, I think it would be safe and easy to assume Gold would have a cap. And you could have searched to see what it was.
---
It's optional but it would be cool if you could feel like your progress would be saved if you put a few cool things down to make your workshop unique. Why would you beautify your camp? Why not just place nodes down and a vendors and not put in any effort at all? If you can place down preset workshops wouldn't it encourage more building?
---
Blurprinting a bunch of stuff at once is not as easy as it sounds. The game makes it a pain in the ass to actually place it all again because without fail something ends up "floating" and needs support. I'll never forget when I moved my camp and had to rebuild the entire thing because the blueprint captured one damn corn stalk I didn't notice that was impossible to support.
---
Ah my brother explained this to me one time years ago... He said when video games bug out, it’ll place stuff in the center of the map. 
---
That spot north of whitesprings where we always see hoard events and players there? Is the center of the map. I notice when my buddy loads into my private server their dot is in that exact same spot while they’re in the loading screen, then when they finish loading their dot moves to wherever they spawned in at.
---
Hoard events take place on the map, but sometimes those moving hoards will enter buildings and interiors, and since the hoard event isn’t technically on the map anymore, it wigs the marker out and it appears in that one spot, the middle of the map. 
---
(Look at the hoard event on that spot next time, it’ll say “Hoard event, ash heap” for example, even though that spot is in the forest. And when you fast travel to it, you’ll spawn in the interior the hoard is in, in the ash heap somewhere. I had one do that to me one time and it placed me in the deepest part of the burning mine, a place I’ve never been in. That was freaky... Fast traveling to a hoard event just to exit the loading screen in some dark cave that’s on fire, I thought it transported me to Hell.)
---
Thanks for this info! very helpful, what do you take in agility though?
---
I can reverse this question, How do I get my 19 year old son to play fallout.  I even bought him a copy and he refuses to play because it was broken on release according to him.  He never has logged into the account I bought for him.
---
Has anyone transcribed that message? It so garbled and missing key words that I’m convinced it’s a threat.
---
Half the community just got done farming screws through the Assaultron Helmet scrapping interaction that they just fixed last patch.
---
Not terribly surprised with the response here. Oh, reddit...
---
28F who plays EST evenings and too much during the weekend, feel free to add me to play sometime! PSN Futile-Devices
---
Yes you’re supposed to talk to him to initiate the quest. He can also give you a quest to rescue a settler or kill some enemy. If you just want the weapon quest, scrap his bar and rebuild it until he gives you the weapon quest.
---
They picked those resources because that is what the BOS would actually need to construct their base.
---
And that's why I don't get it. It's only achievable by duping but no duper would bother. It's only useful to new players but they'll never have the resources available to do it. Who is this for lol
---
Heavy guns/melee is what you're looking for. If you're not sneaking or using vats much you have MUCH more freedom with your perk points for QOL perks which it seems is what you're looking for.
---

I get my cork from golf balls and baseballs.
---
I have no idea how to get it in bulk. Even plastic is easier.
---
Though, concrete at least has workshop resource extractors for it, though I haven't put one down in over a year because the need for it is so low until this event.
---
That just kills me man.if its luck please dont buy a lottery ticket.but do you craft at your camp?I never rolled anything good there.maybe just try your luck at a diffrent location.none the less I know that sucks to go through so many modules and not be close to having a set
---
Oh, trust me I know. It's always the same names trying to defend Bethesda while intentionally misinterpreting what's being said to discredit anyone complaining. I never had him blocked to begin with as I'm not going to mute opposing opinions. Just going to add one more name to the list of people here that'll go to any length to defend this bullshit and not respond.
---
Because my camp is a permanent (unless the rebuilding itch becomes too much to bear) place. No other player can claim my camp while I'm in that world.
---
Workshops are community areas that can, and have, change hands many times during a session.
---
One of my favorite events along with Leader of the Pack for how quickly you can complete dailies with it. 
---
As an added bonus LotP drops ok legendaries for those looking to make leveling alts.  I typically keep one until level 8 so the level 5 1 star armor and weapons get handed down
---
I’m about to just ditch it stick with the decent bolstering chest I got and just trade for combat
---
Forget those shitty little cars and trucks. I want a salvaged APC or tank.
---
I mean.... I wanted it. But I'm a BOS fanboy. A little sad I probably won't get it tbh.
---
damn duplitious dupers!
---
If you are on Windows 10, hit the Windows Key and G, there is a recorder built in.  I have pretty minimal settings and it works fine at 720p/30fps.
---
Completely agree.  The only good thing that came out of it for me was that apparently you can get a mutation from sitting in the storm.
---
I got speed demon for my trouble which was a surprise.
---
I only made one attempt to complete the challenge though.  It really was a terrible idea.
---
THIS.  Hell yes, this.  That's a major issue with MMOs in general.  It's too easy to fill in with mindless grinding when the content runs out, and call it a win when the engagement hours don't fall too much after players finish each new DLC story arc.  That's an advantage to single-player games: they are expected to end.  MMOs, ideally, would last forever without ending or losing players.  New content that takes developer time and money.  But grinding is cheap to maintain and somehow keeps many (most?) people coming back.
---
I'm all for Bethesda experimenting with new event types.  We need more new content to bridge the gaps between major releases. Not that "grind by doing this specific thing now" is much in the way of new content.  But it's something.  
---
It seems like they could have foreseen these stages (concrete, cork) being poorly received simply by thinking about the loot rarity and resulting grind lengths.  At least this is another data point for shaping future community events.
---
Cubic yards - eww XD
---
How to design a better mousetrap. First rule: Don't let Bethesda Austin design the mousetrap.

epic event, lul

At least we're getting quality posts such as this one every 5 fucking minutes.

And if you buff your xp 6000 xp for the event
---
Impressive.
---
There's a little raft with a Monkey doll near Ohio River Adventures that has a bucket full of golf balls as well.  Probably comparable to Hemlocks numbers.  Also Morgan High in the game gymnasium.

shotgun whith all perks,  aim the legs of any creature (with legs XD). is like the  dart gun  in FO3

Shoot on sight.
---
thank you ☺️i’ll add you the next time i get on!
---
Thx
---
Even so, you only get 1 cork from a pipe weapon.  So, clear out a low level area for maybe 20-30 cork vs. 1K+ steel from a westek run.
---
witch outfits
---
I don’t think they update over the weekend?
---
Ditto! Had rifleman 1st and then switched to Commando. I'm stealth build too. Big difference in my SBQ events. Short bursts... :)
---
I think it wasn't updated. It still shows day one state.
---
unpopular opinion but I don't mind Ghoul Slayers too much, as I do most of my experience farming, or some of my fave events involve ghouls to some extent..
---
I'll get a pack before I get food
---
My first chest,  unyielding , 15% block, +1 INT (perfect for shotguns and heavies) , the rest took 100s of rolls for first unyielding.  Yet to roll a bloddy or junkies gaussmini , only one star bloody gauntlet after 50 of them.
---
[events page](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Stil says about 5mil. No way we're making it. No one cares I guess.
---
I died at you correcting to kith
---
Dunno when or frequency. I’m just floating the link out there for folks to reference.
---
Lode Bugging?
---
Seriously, that event fails to start correctly half the time it seems.
---
Also, why do those reward tokens weigh so damned much...
---
Prefer guns, while I like melee in theory, it feels immersion breaking to stand and swing at a huge death claw while it's chewing on me.
---
Yeah I got a couple of good weapons that way. I still check vendors just in case.
---
Yeah I know, it's way rarer than steel but a bit better than concrete, as you can reliably get it from enemys and you could also craft pipe weapons to scrap them as they don't take the cork to craft but that's more of an exploit bethesda shouldn't be promoting
---
Yea there is a weird hole in the wall with loot in it.
---
I don't get how these events continue to be so underwhelming and lack any excitement
---
But then people would finish builds fast and stop playing
---
I dont think there's even a junk dupe/exploit currently. Besides *maybe* PC. But that would be from use of a 3rd party program
---
Not for bethesda it isn’t
---
You can switch blueprints when you take over. The whole point of my idea is to make your build more perm. So whether its just generators and nodes blueprint or something more unique looking i think it will be a good idea for the community.
---
If someone builds up a workshop you can just use a blueprint to paint over theirs. Every person can have their own unique workshop look, they can even use all the items from the current workshop to apply to their blueprint and store/scrap the rest.
---
If you don't want to decorate at all your preset workshop that would be up to you. The whole point is you don't have to tediously rebuild generators and node and  power connectors over and over again at the very least. Creativity is a bonus for this idea.
---
You will have to log out then log back in and essentially restart the mission.
---
I know! What would we ever do without such posts!
---
Multiple reports in this post even. My dude, i love this game too, but give it up, they've still got a bunch of work to do.
---
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.
---
Damn if I could trade I would definitely do that.i dont have to tell you how good ss is.ill record tonight crafting 10 pieces and see if I get one.i find If I hit the craft button fast I end up making duplicates just as well
---
 bloodied melee builds that have perception points 🤣🤣🤣
---
Are you seriously calling people donkey brains?
---
Oh that's a great tip, thanks! I'll try it some time, may I ask if there are settings for it and where the clips are saved?
---
The areas spawn mobs based on the player level. Problem is on the public servers players usually have already spawned them. I was on a mission to whitespring. Mobs were level 60 I was level 30. The legendary mobs made it impossible for me to complete mission. I jumped on private server and they spawned my level and I easily finished it. Obviously without fallout 1st sub that's impossible for you but you can always ask on discord for help.
---
Yeah not wasting a buff on that.  I'll buff line in the sand for many thousands per spawn and many levels for the event.
---
I'm not bloodied so no unyielding for me.  I need scorchy brains and berry tats, canned stew (carnivore) and bobbleheads, lunchboxes and building teams to maximize my xp.
---
Double xp weekend.was insane.  I should have grinded more but I was unavailable to do so.
---
I got the T65 first and now working on the SS. Honestly, the PA is a tank in event fights. I can kiss the SBQ in the T65 and she just gives me a tickle. LOL
---
If you’ve got 8 intelligence, you can fix it without a core, I think. I’ve done it multiple times and never had to give a core, never had it explode. The woman is so very happy afterwards!
---
Had a few, didn't work out
---
Resigned? That's optimistic. I never had any intention to help the BoS to start lol At least us raiders can mug you face to face! 😎
---
It's bugged. You're most likely going to have to change servers which will, unfortunately, cause the mission to revert to the last checkpoint, whenever that was.
---
It's the Brotherhood of 'Steel', they should've just left the event at 'donate steel' since the BOS will need steel to build power armor, Not to mention augmenting the poor reward structure with something worth donating that steel for. PA skins, PA paints, beret plans, or something worth the donation and the time spent. 
---
You can actually get the steel by playing the game, that would've been closer to the 'Kill X# of Scorched' event that preceded Wastelanders, and instead of forcing people to FT(and deal with a FT bug) they could've reskinned those miserable Atom Shop Standees as donation points for the BOS and slapped them down in train stations.
---
The entire event is poorly planned and poorly executed, seems like another instance where they don't understand what their playerbase wants from this game in the least possible sense.
---
Cork will fail harder than concrete I think, steel is so easy to some by it was a doddle as people were sat on 10 - 15k or more in many cases, who hoards concrete? lol
---
I'm still looking for a blocking piece I have a decent unyielding set of ss but perks are meh.
---
A stripper pole would be awesome for the allies!
---
I don't know whether dupers are truly the source of the steel/cork for the event but even if they were there isn't a real reason for them to have duped concrete since it's only used for building (and few of them are likely to be avid camp builders).
---
The real issue I suspect is that concrete is just hard to come by through regular gameplay. You can scrap almost everything for steel, wood and plenty of cork. Concrete is a scarcer resource. Additionally, if you didn't have Fallout 1st you're likely tossing it because you don't need it as much as the other materials.  
---
My primary activity in the game is building and I'm frequently out of concrete but have thousands of steel.
---
There's been tons of threads about this in the past several hours... but of course that the most click-baity gets the most attention...
---
Save us, Dupers!
---
I went to donate the concrete I had after picking up some cement bags and a few hours of a concrete extractor. Didn’t have 250 though so couldn’t donate it. Ram that.
---
Yep, anyone who bottlenecks their build to be only viable with one kind of weapon is a donkey brained moron.
---
Imagine not having max strength and at least 11 perception.
---
You just need to go to the Atlas Observatory. Once there you'll see stash boxes and a brotherhood symbol above it, you go to that once you have enough (250 or multiple thereof) material on you and just hit donate. There is a regular stash box there as well, so you can grab your materials from there and not have to lug them there.
---
&gt; Fool me once, shame on you... fool me twice, shame on me!
---
That reminded me of [this nugget of history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ6N-sb7SVQ).
---
Same man. Checked out the event day 1, didn't even have 250 steel to donate. Then after reading about the rewards, I just never went back.
---
Waste of time and resources.
---
I don't think they'd make supports out of cork, they'd be using wood
---
How much deposit is needed to get to rank3 for the friendly?
---
One thing I didn't know, and only discovered yesterday was for the area that has Sludge as the deposit, the molerats that spawn frequently also have sludge. I had been killing them and just picking them up from the ground. So that area should be easy to solo since they spawn so often.
---
It most likely didn't get updated (as it still shows day one progress), but I doubt enough donations happened since.
---
LotP=daily/weekly legendary quests DONE.  Would love if they increased the difficulty of the Pack Leaders to 3star! Or at least the final boss
---
Alot of places got books and such, should be no problem, leather too, farm animals
---
Heavy guns would be nice, but don't they consume like an extrema amount of ammunition? At least looking at the minimum and alike?
---
I was thinking perhaps something like shotgun/rifles and explosives, but perhaps that's hard to make a build around ?
---
Bog town has 11 I believe. The cemetery by Ohio River has 5. There are also a couple in the tunnel when doing riding shotgun quest. I typically can’t get 36 in one server run.
---
Fast travel to load bearing, start event, start a timer for 6 minutes 30 sec, do literally anything else, travel back when timers up for easy notes.
---
Exactly. If only we had a proper Enclave Collectron. Either with or without the eerie MODUS voice.
---
Yeah, that one sucks bad. I try to stash my junk immediately as the SBQ event ends and before I go out into the Nuke Zone.
---
I don't get that bug often but when I do, it sucks.
---
But you can have a perfectly optimized heavy or shotgun build without them... And your melee build isn't optimized if you're using more than 3 perception. That's not an alternate spec that's just a hybrid that is gonna be worse than real melee or real rifleman
---
I’d rather do that then read yet another whiney post about this. 
---
Players who just grind for Uber gear are so annoying.
---
Thanks! Dumb question perhaps but what's QOL?
---
You'll get nothing and like it!.......until they make it a free item anyway in the shop next Tuesday
---
The ultracite laser weapons can drop from any BOS quest from the main game.  Events included.  The chance is not too bright though.  Especially on the gatling variant.  Mine came from a friend with christmas presents.
---
I'm pretty sure this is the case anyway.
---
BoS needs that much concrete the same way this subreddit needs this many posts about concrete.
---
Thats my point. Dupers could effortlessly wrap this even up if they had a reason to. The rewards for this event are such that even the laziest achievers in our community, the dupers, can't be motivated to complete it.
---
I'd simply show him how it plays since wastelanders. I only bought it when Bethesda finally realised the majority of their player base preferred solo play. I pick up me state pension next year and have been gaming since gaming began. It seams the older you get the more strategy and resource management appeals to you. Having said that I quite enjoy doing some damage with the Final Word! Same answer applies to your lad joekerr.
---
This is Bethesda’s mindset lol, We must add ridiculous grinding for the best stuff and stack impossible odds on top of that grind to keep players around so they might buy atoms or fallout first.
---
I have a friend in the exact same spot although his camp isn't as pretty he still retains a red rocket I placed down long ago, (Use to be able to put do atom shop stuff in others camps but not anymore).
---
The mire atmosphere is a beautiful place in the Fallout universe, I would change to there but I have a really good mining operation in the Ash heap another location not many camp in I've notice.
---
Meant more in the grand scheme of things, when buffed up doing double xp weekend etc it's only a quick and easy event with lots of gains for minutes work. I feel you line in sand is awesome for xp.
---
awww that's really sweet. Thanks, Wastelander! Have an upvote for making me feel so appreciated.
---
Yeah it sucks :(
---
NICE
---
Mr.joekerr if this is on pc...pass me the account and I will gladly play with you.lol...that's a tuff one my oldest kid said the same thing.he loves borderlands though
---
M'Member.
---
that event looks like no one made the effort of putting any deeper thought into it. with all factions, we could farm for reputation with collecting building materials, at least for the settlers.  where is the problem with "hey, here we are, the brotherhood of steel, and we make you an offer: you bring us resources, we reward you with gear" ... but nooo, i guess it will be the SAME "design" as with the wastelanders...
---
A clean toilet that gives no rads when you drink from it. *fingers crossed*
---
Move three points into perception and get a card for each commando. It’ll help. Also trade that gun for a bloodied automatic rifle.
---
This way you won’t have to switch cards at all but you’ll have to sacrifice a couple points somewhere, better to be versatile when the moment comes than to be fiddling with those perk cards.
---
Alright, so I'm never going to experience the same things as you. So I can't really say I know what it's like...I don't.
---
My point is, I've played video games for a long time, and for the most part, no one's gender or sexual orientation comes up. I could only guess by a screen name, and sure, might be able to tell male or female by voice, but I don't know how I would know someone was transgender unless they told me.
---
But again, I can't tell you what your experience has been, only my own. Though I do remember the open voice chat on GTA V, that was some toxic language from what I assumed were 10 year olds.
---
you are so sweet.! have an upvote for your kind words!!
---
Too much effort for almost no reward, here's your Atlas box and beat it kid
---
Radiation Rumble is too hectic of an event to wait for people to tag some level 40 legendary that isn’t gonna drop max level gear, Just kill anything that moves. Our job in those kinda events is protect the escort target(s) no matter what, not be courteous to the other players there. 
---
(I know I’m not going to leave a legendary alive and attacking the scavvers just to call it out to random players. Not trying to be a dick, but I’m not gonna let the escort targets die so SwagDaddy69 over there killing stuff with an explosive Gatling plasma can get his level 40 1* Nocturnal baton...)
---
I hated having to do the heavy lifting for the wayward, overseer, foundation, &amp; crater, and that had tangible benefits &amp; rewards. This is like 150x the effort for a f***** hat or flag.
---
You do a small favor for Modus and he shoots a freaking care package down to you from orbit. The BOS can suck it.
---
oh I'm gonna chuckle about this comment for awhile..
---
The more these players love pointing out mistakes on Bethesda's part, the more they cannot accept making mistakes of their own.
---
No point arguing with them. Some people can never admit they were wrong.
---
Those tin can wearing pansies are gonna love my gauss minigun. Walking electricity conductors they are.
---
WITH
---
Thanks for this. What about the Brotherhood Fatigues outfit? I found one yesterday that goes over the armor. I know it was rare back in the beginning, when they used to drop at what is now Foundation, but idk if the spawn/drop rate has changed since Wastelanders.  
---
I’d like to know if it’s worth anything.
---
Lol. Better than being like you.
---
You clicked on the post lol, im just pointing out a problem that could be easily changed to make it more enjoyable. I would rather grind for something guarenteed than grind for the chance to get something.
---
I think there is no canon ending as of yet, since they went to 76 and if we would of had a fallout after the events of 4 than we would've known. Your feeling is as valid as my feelings of the Minutemen and Bos grouping up to destroy the institute while the railroad lose meaning and purpose. It's all speculation and I doubt Bethesda will let their preferred faction the B.O.S die. Especially since we seem to be seeing a serious power flex on the Bos side. Probably ending up with a NCR and Brotherhood of steel all out war in the end, ending with another post apocalyptic war with the ending saying "War War never changes" as the screen fades to black.
---
Sure.  I'm on pc anyway
---
I want a Wise Mothman cult. I like Mothman but I'm not a delusional, violent psychopath like the actual cultists...
---
inb4 the BOS comes and they build massive concrete structures anyway
---
Yeah we just need to server hop endlessly for 50 cork at a time lol
---
*general healing*
---
I haven’t seen any legit ones. When the bug was active you’d see this sub filled with those posts every day at 12:05
---
Underrated comment.
---
You can give your ally weapons. Drop the weapon you want them to use with the ammo for it. They will use it for that server only. Will need to do the same thing when switching servers. Hope this helps
---
Mate, you're a raider, why do you even care :))
---
That. Would be absolutely fucking *awesome.*
---
If Fallout 5 ends there, then that would be a very satisfactory ending to the Fallout series.
---
Wtf really? I recall that they broke the windows so you could walk through it, and the Patch 21 notes claimed to have fixed that. Goddammit, the bungalow is my favorite :(
---
I feel you.  I'm just a bit of an oddball.  I'm casual most of the time until I get a goal in my head.  Then the calculator comes out and it's full steam ahead.  Optimal runs, muscle memory, the whole 9 yards.
---
But since I rarely have a goal anymore other than get bigger gun, I just kind of roam and collect things.  I only buff for the big shows.  My luck is so bad I just stopped trying to optimize legendary farming cause I could get the legendaries.   Quantity was not an issue. Quality was.
---
I found a tin foil hat inside the asylum, third floor... that was a first for me. Is that common in the asylum? I know of two other fixed spawns for it though.
---
You can drop it either way, right?
---
Just use the same system as for camps, you can just edit it by replacing the item. Just you can load in optional workshop blueprints after scrapping or using everything already there to place it for free if it's a copy item of items in your blueprint.
---
i mean, they already talked about having persistent workshops in private worlds, my idea isn't that crazy sounding.
---
Just allow the edits of current blueprints so you can resave it at any time.
---
Just another Vault-Tec test.
---
They disrespect their customers so much they probably said this in a meeting: "Can we get our ~~complaining users~~ customers to think hunting concrete is content. Maybe if we give them stupid digital flag, shirt, skin or something. We got backlogs of assets that will cost us nothing to push out."
---
yay!
---
Member.
---
It’s a goal of people don’t want to donate they don’t have to
---
In Fallout 1 they were hoarding tech too, that's about 60 years away
---
That evidence really has been cemented, huh.
---
EGG
---
Bizzare name wont lie
---
Defo im level 367 now im just trying to grind rare outfits and hate having to drop legendary so give loads away had 5 fixers since update all no good lol 😆  zealots stalkers quality is an issue.
---
My people. Don't panic, I duped heavily back when it was super easy with the display cases. I have over 1500000000 ready to donate. I'm just making them wait.
---
Yeah, just south, I believe
---
Yep
---
That's just another reason I think the counter is fake, honestly.
---
Ngl I don't think we're gonna reach any of the others because it's not the greatest community challenge. But I wouldn't be surprised if they lied about the results just so it looks like people are participating
---
It’s for all the razergrain flour they’re gonna be making MREs with.
---
I’d rather not. That woman is filthy, and not in the good way.
---
 Yeah you can, they aren’t prohibited nor you will get a ban (unless it is a cheating mod and maaaaaybe then). Bethesda official stand with them is : you can use them we won’t support issues with em.
---
Think BOS underground base, Hoover Damn levels.
---
We'd go back to the old "Is Fallout worth playing now with the Wastelanders updates?" or the "I'm just getting back into the game after I stopped playing because of the bugs/glitches/lack of NPCs, is there anything I need to know?" types of posts.
---
Marsupial was my first. It totally changes the way you play. You'll love it! No one mentioned Scaly Skin... increases damage and energy resistance but a minor hit to your AP. Liked they said below, have that Starched Gene and Class Freak perk card maxed out. Class Freak will negate 75% of any mutation's negative perks.
---
It is in the Atomic shop as of now.
---
i’m not on hormones yet so i sound a lot younger than i actually am and often get accused of being a child so then i have to explain that i’m actually my age but just trans and that’s why my voice is higher pitched. i’m 25 and sound prepubescent so there’s really no hiding it, unfortunately /:
---
I would be happy if some dropped level 1 gear. I recently messed up transferring and lost all the legendary gear my leveling alt had.  I'd like to get another bloodied pipe revolver, zealots auto pipe rifle and set of vanguard/chameleon wood armor at level 1.
---
I am aware of that, and it's a cool little way the game interacts with the world
---
But equipping a weapon similar to how you equip clothing to your ally would be much better
---
&gt;The number you see on the page means absolutely nothing.
---
Yeah  it's like [the official NORAD tracker](https://www.noradsanta.org/) that tracks Santa Claus on Christmas eve  lol.
---
I’m level 83 I think now and it’s depressing now being able to get a level a day anymore, have plenty of atoms to buy my out there rest of the board, but don’t want to waste them on that
---
Those haven’t left.
---
Oh wait I only get a banner? No then
---
So you're telling me their pre determined count for day one was less than three percent of the goal? If youre going to bullshit it helps to have at least some grasp on reality.
---

What legendary effects really help so much?

Agent Cole seems to have forgotten about that.

Yesterday I finished Dropped Connection - Watoga only to have it fire off again two minutes later. 
---
And I’ve been on servers where it was dead for 20 minutes. 
---
Something is up, y’all.
---
I have 100 concrete I was willing to donate and can't, and it'll be the same with cork. I have a feeling it's that way for a lot of players, and I'm not going to just drop it in hopes someone else can use it.
---
It should have been tiered - 100, 250, and 500. The other events had different reward boxes, it was strange that this one didn't. Let alone nothing new? Nah, I'll pass.
---
Poor Mole Rat
---
I havent even seen the devs acknowledge his issue. This is by far the most infuriating bug to deal with though. Second is getting stuck in aim down site with running jumping or crouching and having to switch weapons to get out of it. The fucking amount of bugs that persist in this game are ridiculous.
---
In other news, good chance to get a higher rank today in some NW matches from everyone bailing before it starts.
---
I'm definitely not spending any Atoms, but yeah it's become a slog.
---
I meant - maybe you should leave some of them for other lower levels to get if they need them. Not buy them all out cheap to resell/vendor
---
You Son of a B!tch, I'm In...

A picture taken moments before a molerat disaster.

Wow, you must be smart if you can read fast I’m sorry I didint know I would be graced by your presence today my apologies. I’m surprised you’re not out finding a cure for cancer with that big brain of yours. (Btw I’m pretty sure you have to click on a post to comment so...)
---
Floaters. All the way. I would not shed a single tear if the removed them from the game altogether.
---
I just look forwards to the 2-3 levels I can get when the weeklys come around
---
Bethesda has actually replied to this post which is nice to see
---
Yesterday was funny as hell. The outer circle was lined with people. It made matches really easy because people just offed themselves at the start
---
Stopped as soon as I saw how stupid the provisions were. Kudos to the guy that released the loot table, saved a lot of us the time and frustration of wondering if it was just bad rng.
---
Don't go chasing waterfalls... Kidding! Just keep to the forest area for a while longer before you go progressing main quest stuff. It will take you into areas that are levelled a bit high for new players. Your best bet is to work on levelling in the forest region through workshop claiming/defense and events in the forest. Join a building team every chance you get, since intelligence nets higher XP, and stick to forest events, and you'll level up fairly quickly and can tackle the harder regions.
---
Oh your one of them people...😏
---
There is a Settings Gear right in the menu, as well as showing all recent clips, and then you can click "Open File Location".  I know I changed my default.  It's also a way to see friends/invites/etc for Xbox GamePass for PC (which now has 76 on it as well).
---
I can help you here! I recently discovered that deathclaw eggs don't spoil, so I've been hoarding them for the same thing, or to cook an omelette in a pinch. Here is where I go:
---
Abandoned Waste Dump: 2 searchable nests directly outside of the entrance, the one on the left usually has a loose egg that spawns on the ground too. Inside the cave itself there are 2-3 deathclaw matriarchs, which have a decent chance to drop eggs, and 3 nests, 1 of which almost always has one on the ground next to it.
---
Deathclaw Island: The nest itself is not a searchable container, but I believe usually two eggs spawn in it. I think the deathclaw itself will also sometimes drop an egg.
---
I usually end up with 4-6 eggs per day, but more should be possible if you are really lucky.
---
Well, it's Monday. So many things to do, so little time. 😅
---
It’s nice when Mad Dog comes out to the parking lot to get shot.
---
But yeah agree with everything you said
---
Definitely the one with Crit damage
---
Its been fixed.
---
They can, but ammo crafting tends to help offset that to some extent.
---
5mm and .50cal craft large amounts in one craft. Using AmmoSmith boosts it by +80% at rank2, making it 180 rounds per craft. If you use SuperDuper, then that's like another 100 rounds.
---
The Gatling gun is an ammo efficient 5mm weapon, decent accuracy, slow ROF.
---
A light machinegun is a prime example of an ammo blackhole, does really nice damage, goes through ammo fast, and the ammo crafting doesn't yield much per craft. Went through like 3000 rounds in a couple hours of doing events.
---
Shotguns are fine, but somewhat range limited. you have to be pretty close for max damage.
---
Semi-Auto rifles are fine, but tend to be more sneaky builds, which you wanted to avoid. Still viable, but the lower ROF can be problematic with swarms of enemies. Maybe a rifle + good melee would work.
---
The bestest big base goes to...
---
I need better self control myself and know when to walk away haha
---
Just couple server hops and buy from enclave vendor, it will be forest or urban, got plenty of them for sale in my vendor, fully modded
---
The crates are not the fucking reward, they're just a minor bonus. Just like last year's scorched event the actual reward is the community rewards. We didn't get shit aside from the community rewards last year, all of which sucked aside from the purveyor sale, and people completed it without bitching that rare plans weren't falling out of the sky.
---
I'd say the second one is better
---
3* AA, +50 LD, FR
---
At this rate he's gonna be promoted to paladin from day 1, can you imagine sending out your recruit on a salvage mission and they return with 25 million pounds of steel?
---
I am smart! Thanks for noticing! Usually dumb people like you can’t! 
---
Yup you do have to click on a post to comment! Very good look at you! Only your original comment was about clicking on it to READ it.
---
Lol moron.
---
Only thing I really wanted was that Brotherhood of Steel collectron well I guess I better save up 500 atoms oh wait that's right we don't even earn those anymore if you're a veteran and completed 98% of all your other challenges, minus all the 7600 count challenges....
---
I can't even find where to turn in concrete , the boxes all say turn in steel when I go up to them.
---
Either way get used to manual aiming.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
The first one is better even if your not using vats. But just a non charged critical shot in vats is going to one shot/ two shot most things with that. As long as your built for vats rifleman  .
---
Don't forget to hit up the building next to the workshop. On the second level are a number of bags of concrete as well.
---
Lol. Glad I am not the only one that looked into what kind of volume of concrete it was. However, I got a different answer because I went off of the games bag of concrete weight which is 5lbs. Yep very small bags of concrete in the wasteland. 
---
150,000,000 concrete is 21.4 million bags at 7 concrete per bag. 5 lb bag (game weight) of concrete mix yields 3.75 cubic feet of concrete. So the BOS has roughly 80.3 million cubic feet of concrete. This is 2.97 million cubic yards at 27 cubic feet per cubic yard. Hoover dam took 4.36 million cubic yards of concrete in total (including buildings and power plant). Not quite enough for game weight bags of concrete but no RL bag comes at 5 lbs of weight.
---
For context, the rl Summersville dam is made of 12 million cubic yards of dirt and rock (it’s a big dam) so that volume of concrete could not be used to rebuild from scratch the dam that the raiders blew up.
---
Not that bad, tbh.
---
This is going to be my first ever completed NW challenge
---
I shot three players in rapid succession walking out of the fire. Didn’t even have to reload. ☠️☠️☠️
---
I feel like Richard Gere would love using this toilet.
---
I feel your pain! I had to resort to claiming a workshop with concrete nodes, but even they don't really produce enough in a typical game session to net enough for a drop-off. I think maybe if you claimed multiple ones and got them all producing, you might get enough for one, providing no one comes and yoinks it away from you.
---
I got 4 pieces of 3* uny ss out of about...I don't know...a hundred tries? No god rolls but usable.
---
If you want a god roll it's probably gonna take ages as it should be... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Never crafted a bloodied gauss sg yet tho, not even a 1*...so, in the end, rng kind of balances itself I suppose.
---
You now get to see those sorts of gaffs daily with Biden.
---
What are you looking for for them?
---
It's not the amount so much, more the chances for something good, either to keep or stick in the vending machines. With 5 to 10 drops per lap the chance for something decent is reasonably good and some of my best gear has dropped at the Whitespring.
---
I do miss herding the club house ghouls onto the tennis court though, shame they messed with that. Was fun to cripple them all then drop an orbital strike beacon in the middle and watch the xp roll in.
---
Vats + 50%
---
Crits every day of the week, the Gauss rifle shines in VATS
---
or under the map as some ppls bases are
---
I heard they are dropping again In the mire and cranberry bog
---
Hey don’t judge them like that, there’s still good raiders out there
---
I think any face covering does. Fasnacht mask did for me. Mascot heads too.
---
I'm pretty sure they were semi legally working kids hence why you can hear them almost scream "MOMMA"
---
Thanks, gonna make a visit there as well. Perhaps there is a change we are going to make it.
---
Lol I barely have 1000 of any resource
---
 Well: unyielding if bloodied which gives u more exp, carry weight, AP, etc., Vanguard if junkies brings u to the same level of dr/er. Second stAr powered for AP refresh, Or poison resistance. Third star would be even more weight reduction for weaps/junk/armor or cavalier/sentinel
---
Yeah!!
---
Hey. It's on the list. Not rare. I actually think it's a bug that it goes over armor as supposed to be underarmor
---
I encourage you to correct my "mistake" with a different number that is properly sourced, was available at the time of my post,  and not just "they didn't update it" excuse. This is the latest number provided to us by the developers themselves, yet you somehow claim it's a "mistake".
---
I legit hope we fail the rest of the way because of people like you
---
Maybe it will autocomplete tomorrow.
---
Fantastic. Use the flame thrower or the dirt mound glitch?
---
All I'm gonna say is that Steel Dawn and Fractured Steel had better be worth it. I guess we'll see when Steel Dawn (hopefully) comes next patch as they said
---
Hah i know im stuck at 50 upgrades waiting. As for home office im also having it now 😁 good times 👍 but im usually just able to do dailies/challanges and some nuclear winter as i can just bush wookie and work at the same time.
---
On the contrary, I find Daily Challenges driving players to take workshops while carrying tons of junk to be HIGHLY entertaining.  Keep the servers full and active every day.
---
You may well be right
---
Even if Aluminum is a more valuable scrap it still would have been better than concrete as it is at least a guaranteed drop from some robots and can be farmed. Your only options for concrete are picking up bags around the map and sitting on an extractor.
---
Uranium Fever + Killing and Looting Everything + Scrapper = All of the Steel.
---
Uranium Fever + Killing and Looting Everything + Super Duper + Glowing Meat Steaks + Hard Bargain = 500+ Caps
---
Oh hell yeah finally a nw challenge I want to do!
---
OK, I'll try that. I was used to the radio raider guy - he tells you when he's got something. :)
---
If you’re on Xbox message me here with your gamertag and what you’re looking to trade for them. I find traders to be very subjective and when I go through the trouble of server hopping to meet them in game they seem to flake out
---
It goes over and doesn’t replace my under armor.
---
Don’t have one yet
---
Boy am I glad I didn't have to actually play a round wearing that dumb BOS beret. Tototally forgot it got auto selected for NW. 90% of the lobby was wearing it lol.
---
Maaan I can't understand that, I'm 26 and I would play literally anything if my Dad asked me one day
---
We haven't played a game together for about 15 years now, no idea why, it used to be our favorite thing to do together 
---
Maybe one day..
---
I hope your son comes around
---
You sound like you do try and connect with him, and that's something he may not really notice now but he will when it's important, and he would definately notice if you didn't
---
If you use often VATS the first one, otherwise the second one.
---
Lol I mean, I'm usually one of the few people still defending the devs around here... But these numbers just don't make any sense from an average player perspective. 
---
Non 1st members don't horde low tier junk and limiting deposits to 250 stacks means that all the minor contributions aren't possible even from people willing. 
---
Concrete and cork are not something the average user has sitting in stacks. 
---
Hell, I doubt even the heavy dupers were sitting around with anything more than a 100k of either. 
---
Steel, sure, I'll toss a couple thousand steel to try out the provisions but then like most, I got disappointed with what the provisions gave and only tossed 250 concrete.
---
Also, fuck the Brotherhood.
---
No idea what you are rambling about
---
You are correct that I want to get the banner is the reason it is doomed. You argument is completely logical
---
Well I’m a hoarder and pick every item up even though I don’t need it.
---
The only reward I really care about is the collection. Since thats the cloth week, it'll be super easy, as pre-war money is just about everywhere, and I think we all have too much cloth.
---
The skull gas mask?  If that’s the one you’re referring to than yes it does.
---
The Encryptid event is more successful in completing than Project Paradise. Never had a Project event complete with all 3 animals. Lucky to get 1 animal but never all 3. Not enough time. Miserable failure for even high levels.
---
"we don't call him slick for nothing"
---
I've always wondered if people who play other franchises are as whiny as Fallout players, as well.
---
I bet your type is getting really desperate that your whole "it's rigged" conspiracy theory is so quickly and easily unraveling.
---
I can see a major fail in all Fortifying Atlas Phases. Most people just are not doing them or can't afford it. I canceled my Fallout 1st Subscription so I am not giving anything to them because I can never replace what I have. I am serious Bethesda is not getting another dime out of me till there are some Major Changes to the way they do things in this game! No matter how my Cosmetics I miss out on they are not essential to gameplay.
---
Diablo: Do u guys dun have phone? Do u ever heard of W3 Refund?
---
Yeah, I was quite happy doing the steel run because it's piss easy to grind and I don't mind "crappy" rewards... Didn't even bother with concrete as can't be arsed server hopping to get the numbers up
---
Ffffffuuucckkkkkkk ty!
---
Ah, one of THOSE people....
---
That map you’re linking is for Bobby pins. Perhaps that’s the issue?
---
Exactly 😅
---
why do you need that bush?
---
Makes me feel grateful for what we have, the hot weather is awful. Unprecedented to have these temperatures for so long. But I used to live in Oz &amp; we had cyclones &amp; 45 C heat so I feel your pain. You have it way worse than us. I hope things get back to normal for you all soon :)
---
Yeah the fallout games always end up with that phrase so I always thought the ending to it all was the NCR and The B.o.S going on a all out war, somehow intergrating 76 with the Nukes, Each desperate to win at any cost, after the death and destruction they leave behind after each battle forgetting why they made their group in the first place to start anew, ending it with the player throwing his gun down on the ground after finishing a battle watching as the bombs drop again and a huge explosion followed with debris flying  everywhere covering the screen fading to black as Ron Perlman reprises his role saying his iconic line "War, War never changes"
---
So... carry weight and some more ap that I don't even use, woo hoo.  I'll take a straight 71% damage reduction and 90% rad reduction, thanks.
---
Maybe there's been a ton because people are pissed off at these obviously out of touch, unobtainable goals locking things like Double SCORE that is owed to us after a month of being robbed of score? At least contribute a counterpoint if you disagree instead of making a completely useless comment that contributes nothing.

I’m on Xbox I’ve never seen that either on chat sites or in game that low even when duping was around like crazy
---
If you’re looking for cranberries there’s 10 at Aaronholt homestead.
---
Yeah it seems like someone who doesn't play came up with the figures they are way wide of the mark. Simply not achievable
---
None have as strange of PR as bethesda, and I think the team for 76 is fairly small, making it a lot harder to maintain the game
---
Funny how the most common resource has the lowest target...
---
Can't be f'd with cork

I love this game. But I can’t stop laughing at the sad concrete meter.

Deliver more concrete to Atlas

outside commonly used materials in repairing/building.. and a couple rare materials like ballistic fiber.. you dont really need more than 50-100 of any given junk item..
---
youre not going to need 800 glass anytime soon...
---
On my main I had 44k steel and 2k concrete. Currently i have 600 cork, basically no plastic since I use it all for shotgun ammo, 6k cloth, 3k leather, and 4k glass but honestly glass and cloth are easy to farm. Not as much as steel but actually doable. Concrete and cork won't happen. I highly doubt plastic or leather will either. I dont think its to catch dupers though. I agree with the suggestion that the devs did NOT think this through.
---
Fun is going to be watching the boycott twits simultaneously crying that they can't get the missed reward while trying to rationalize away how the goal failed when it was supposed to be rigged to auto complete.
---
Oh yeah. I just looked at the photo the link posts on the top of the post in the mobile app.
---
Does it look like this:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_fatigues_(Fallout_76)
---
If so, it's on the list. I believe it is bugged :(
---
Let me investigate it
---
"Armor Ace".....It means we are getting that sweet propeller driven power armor that was datamined!
---
My experience exactly. Actually wanted to test the farm run guides being posted, and aside from a few gnomes, really couldn’t find much as others beat me to it. I have 180-ish concrete scrap in stash, but it wants 250 at a time. Short of buying it at train stations or tearing down my own camp, this Russell will have to get used to disappointing his BoS overlords.
---
Yea it took me till till the end of double score weekend to finish and I was home for 11 straight days cuz of covid testing, I did more exp grinding in those few days than I have since launch.
---
True, but not many recruits come packaged in with enough materials to build a small city. If they don't recruit him, that's just mean.
---
For queen or general purpose anti-scorched duty, I'd say if you don't want to go bloodied or Junkie, then a Primed Zealot's plasma caster would be best. Wear power armor and use stabilized card and all the heavy weapons damage cards.
---
But I will say this: Don't be intimidated about having to stay at low health! I used to think the same way, but I discovered I was very wrong. I run at 19-15%, and very rarely die, and even then mostly due to sheer carelessness. With a bloodied gauss minigun, everything dies before it can hurt me much, if at all.
---
If done properly, a bloodied power armor heavy weapons build can be so tanky you don't NEED lots of health. I run this myself and the scorchbeast queen can hit me directly in the face and I take like 2 damage.
---
Blocker perk reduces incoming melee damage by 45%, Dodgy drops it by another 30%, Emergency protocols on power armor drops damage another 50%. Fireproof makes you even more resistant to fire and explosive damage. Nerd Rage +40 DR is just icing on the cake. Those annoying ghouls and melee scorched will have to work hard to kill you, even if you have low health.
---
Bullshit Ward, you sold it and want me to get it back. I'm on to your scam. &gt;_&gt;
---
Settlers - Vital Equipment (Ward at Foundation - choose no reward), Photo Opportunity (Davenport at Overseers Home - choose The Crater and give photos to Ward with no reward), Retirement Plan (Rocksy at The Crater - convince Former Raider to join Foundation).
---
Raiders - not sure
---
My thought was that Russell is just a dumb wastelander and cargo bots have been dropping off provisions for weeks at the atlas site preparing for the BoS and he's been trading them away without opening them thinking he's doing something "good".
---
The elder will arrive expecting a mountain of stimpacks and provisions for the troops and instead get buckets of trash, steel and glass.Haha
---
Technically the map just shows where Cranberries *ARE* - not necessarily a Cranberry *BUSH*
---
Go to the marker and looking for any props, like fridges, countertops, picnic baskets, etc. it could just be a spawn of a loose Cranberry.
---
Same, which we do do something like, 50/75 modules for Prefix, 25,50,75 (or 75,150,250) for Star Level, and then rest random, as you can only get 150 per day, that should satisfy the Bethesdsa Grind Gods
---
I'm curious too. Im not donating a damn thing. I mean it will be worth it to see the ITV after this whole event is done just to see there pathetic excuse if we failed everything. That alone is worth the price of admission.
---
I know this is a joke, but if it happened, I’d be kind of disappointed. I really enjoy playing with friends. I would, however, love private servers!
---
As most people would do. OP should've singled out the map.
---
Should be in the shop now someone said
---
grind...grind...grind.........
---
A stupid goal, people had 10 to 20k steel, some much more than that, as its useful and readily available just through normal gameplay, but who hoards concrete?
---
Also why the fuck is cork 200 million....nonsense :-)
---
If you’re ever running low on resources like wood or steel, go complete an event like Uranium Fever and collect everything and then scrap everything you possibly can while using the scrapper perk. You can easily get 500+ both of Steel and Wood. Just make sure to drop the bones/mole rat teeth since it’s practically useless.
---
This is what you get when you let your dog use your phone while you’re still logged into Reddit.
---
Bad Fido, Bad! No drinking from the toilet!
---
I’ll send you some screenshots.
---
Idk theres a lot of flat space by FSD. I’ve never really had an issue, and I want to be sure people get the most out of my nuke, not just the queen. Those a glowing snallys at the train yard are too juicy to pass up.
---
I hope so. I want to scrap their base and take all the steel back that we got suckered into donating.
---
Lmao, I’ve had the game since it first came out and I just hit lvl 30 last night
---
I dont see it
---
I browse other games subs from time to time when I’m taking a break from this and I would have to answer with a yes lol.
---
Pretty sure that's a gallery link ... scroll down?
---
Where in the atom shop
---
Bethesda sure is desperate to drain the game of its oh so valuable surplus of... Uhh... Concrete and cork?
---
Congrats. You also probably have less than 15 hours of gameplay if that’s your level.
---
whats the point im just going to blow them up in boston years later
---
A better plan might have been to leave to donations to glass, steel and wood, then add fun objectives like killing special super mutants that have a chance to drop new plans. Or an hourly event where the server fights off a horde or robots at a location the BOS is interested in.
---
Im sure I could learn, and that a lot of it is my gear/perk loadout.  
---
Running with a complete glass-cannon build doesnt help.
---
Looking for less troublesome spots to put my camp and the only resource node I find I'm always looking for is cranberries. I can put it down in the bog, but then I'll come back and find a SB has dusted it and it's all broken - rather not do that.
---
Yep got it. On the mobile app it puts just the Bobby pin map for the post pic.
---
One run of line in the sand and I usually walk with about 2-2.5k steel.
---
*Happy communist noises*
---
There is a fraction of the space by FSD that there is by the dropsite.  Go look in a non nuked server.
---
ah - gotcha
---
Congrats, this is somehow the stupidest thing I've read in this thread.
---
For settlers theres wards daily quest (vital equipment) raiders wren ( importance of communication) rocksy ( brain fart cant remember name of quest) 
---
Davenport in the basement of overseers house has a quest that can get you some rep for one or the other
---
Lol can you imagine the look on ameveryones face if Bethesda came out and straight told us the BOS storyline will not happen. Because we failed every event?? OMG that shit would be priceless!
---
Maybe they’re just adding all the scrap from banned dupers accounts.
---
That has nothing to do with rep
---
Which one ?
---
arnholdt homestead.. 
---
nothing but a few bugs or occasionally a mongrel
---
76 is a total mess. I don’t believe it should be considered canon. The story hardly makes sense to me.
---
We’re you wanting to put your cramp on it so you had a plant in your camp?
---
Please don't save us, because then Bethesda will think we care about this event.
---
It’s only 20 atoms .... haha
---
And Judging by the picture in the atom shop, it makes you go Invisible.
---
Get a chainsaw(the hardware store in Clarksburg has one in the top room), buy a flamer mod at pretty much any train station, put it on, sprint towards your target, aim low in first person view(difficult to do in third person view), and laugh maniacally. I recommend anybody that hasn't done this try it, and don't spoil the fun of what happens.
---
All you need(asides from the chainsaw and flamer mod) is to be level 20+ and have enough health to survive one hit. No perks, any build can do this.
---
I said it at the beginning. In my opinion, if u like PA that’s fine
---
Remember in FO4 when pre-war money was worth 8 caps each at vendors?
---
I think Beth brainfarted the numbers
---
It was, update 21 made it 760
---
Maybe people care but it's just too difficult to farm, so they've given up?
---
Your friends can always join you on a private server
---
Late to this thread but OP is correct.  What also works really well is to just swop the VATS target area.  Ie body to head.
---
There is supposed to be mole miner corpse in there. That and the fact she hosted an event where we committed genocide just to eliminate her  competition should tell you what kind of business she is operating.
---
It is invisible to everyone, even if you have vendors.  As of this writing I am unaware if Bethesda has acknowledged it.  That said it could be intended, though I fail to see why it would be.
---
I "like" it, but it also seems better for heavy guns.  For melee?  Of course not.  For heavy guns?  You're doing more damage and have more protection.  Il love my t 65, btw, in terms of looks.
---
i heard somewhere that this BoS thats coming is a splinter group that broke off of Roger Maxson's Lost Hills group. and since Roger was probably the most altruistic leader the BoS had until Lyons, methinks this splinter group is full of assholes. i would not be surprised if they completely ignore Russel when they get here.
---
The other day we were doing the event and only two of us were activating the pylons.... it was really odd.
---
100% agree, NW challenges should be focused on things that encourage gameplay (such as surviving for 10 mins) but that one was just a tad bit ridiculous. If you spawn in an area with a lot of people you’re basically either dead immediately or screwed out of supplies. Ghoulish is a great card to have for this but requires 9 points to equip it so those just starting out won’t have that chance yet.
---
Yeah just the gold vault and grinding the dailies for both factions to get rep and access to the stuff they sell for gold. After you do the gold vault, public events award treasury notes that can be cashed in for gold to buy plans from the vault and from the raiders/settlers.
---
As for new content, the Brotherhood of Steel is coming next month and that should bring a new questline.
---
The contemporary bundle really helps. Makes a shitty box look nice
---
I hate Liberators. Ludicrously hard to hit.
---
Stingwings, Mirelurk hunters too.
---
To be honest I really wanted that...even more then some of the other things. Kinda have a whole bos bunker camp build I was going todo when they come back. Bit I do agree...concrete is pushing it esp since we need it for camp foundations. Oh well...maybe when Dawn of steel comes it will make it to atomic shop kinda like you failed to get it for free mow ya gotta buy it
---
I finally got mine back last night. I hate NYSEG.
---
Interesting, she is an mean b#tch when it comes to helping me out.
---
Ive was vendoring them in the past, they was pretty common
---
Your ratios are similar enough to support my thoughts on scrap distribution among player stockpiles.  I want to believe that there is a silver lining to it all even if it's probably not true.
---
Be nice! Bring doughnuts!
---
I also thought because I remember the webpage for tracker being down yesterday, so I was thinking that maybe the issue was that it just didn't count the donations? 
---
But yea, you break your ass trying to donate materials for crappy rewards. Hell I don't even really want to support the BOS but it's really the big thing to do in game rn, so I just do it for content.
---
I think it only does the shaking thing if thay are sprinting
---
Freeze them first
---
I always wave over when there’s legendary unless nobody else is giving the same courtesy
---
The Yao Guai's with their stunlock spam. Grr
---
It could be that they’re hugely out of touch with what’s actually possible in the game, as they hardly ever play it, but maybe I’m just being cynical.
---
It’s on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tap on the Featured page
---
I've been hoarding mats since I got fallout 1st three months ago. I had over 10k steel... But only six HUNDRED concrete.
---
Well concrete is a lot scarcer than steel, Bethesda shoulda realized that.
---
I enjoy the creative aspect of building.  I made a huge camp, but now I don't want to move or disassemble it.  
---
On my third character I have CAMP Crappy.  It's just a few basics plopped on the ground.  I am using this alt to try and get the last Raider trophy from the vault raid.
---
Crafted using fertilizer, I'd wager.
---
Hopefully bos paints for the new t65 and secret service armor
---
This game is goddamn ridiculous if you just take a second and look at it from a distance.
---
look im not asking for some rare plan or some other bullshit.  honestly i have given up on finding rare plans (did encyptid 18 times now still no fixer plan) fuck i would be happy with some ammo.  beer and grenades are worth nothing to most of us. honestly if they didn't give the floater grenades i would have been much happier because then i could give them to other who could use them.  plus a lot of the anger from this event is still from fallout out of the update as well. 
---
 look end of the day they could have ask for a lot less concrete.  it feels like they set us up to fail on a few of these.  i enjoy a challenge i really do but if it comes down to me having to spend the whole 2 or 3 hours of game time looking for concrete or having fun running around the wasteland helping others i will do the latter in a heartbeat.  i put in my 2000.  i set up concrete and got thunder mountain going so i can power the resources.  
---
as of last year at least when i killed a scorch i got something decent out of it.  i had fun and was able to do stuff as a group.  this event has no feel of a group achieving anything.  at the end of the day we should play the game that way we should enjoy it.  so far these event have not been enjoyable for most fans.  
---
rambling a bit because of little sleep hope you have a wonderful day.
---
Or pure jibberish and convfefe from the wanna be fascist dictator, pedophile, con artist, lying, adultery committing, locking kids in cages, moron we have now.
---
Honestly I'd take gwb or even bush lite again in a second.  At least they were decent human beings.
---
EPIC FAIL gamers!

---
BoS themed probably Season 3 not 2
---
There’s gnomes and bags of concrete in and around the agriculture center in Flatwoods where fertile soil pops.
---
Yea I have like 200 ish on hand most of the time. But with the Seasons most of my play time is spent doing dailies/weeklies so I haven’t been giving these challenges much thought. 
---
I’ll feel pretty bad if I get the rewards for doing jack all. But also I’m not really motivated, and am limited on play time. I’m sure others probably also feel that way.
---
This subreddit is starting to sound like one of my Architecture classes with how much concrete talk
---
That was it’s only updated since concrete started Saturday and when it began. It wasn’t tracking properly from the start as it was uploaded late and started at zero. Which is funny because people were already donating. It was updated one single time from that point to around now as I checked every hour. They don’t take it seriously.
---
Or vend them at the train station if you still have any of the daily 1400 vendor caps left
---
Don't forget about 2 daily raider quests in "Ohio River Adventures"
---
I had 800 concrete and I have about 300 cork...im affraid I wont be helping these 2 times. However I do have  avg 10000 of each for plastic and all depo for project beta
---
Awesome, thank you (and everyone for the tips!) I can throw some luck into perception, I don’t really need ricochet.
---
There should be a visible trail of smoke coming off of it that you can use to help locate it. Fast travel away and then come back and see if it shows.
---
I could see the need to explain that some.
---
One of my favourite Bush-isms.
---
Had the exact same happen about 3 hours ago, I tried a lot of different things, the only thing that fixed it was changing server
---
Cant you be banned for doing this or?
---
That may still be true. Day isn’t over yet.
---
I’m ready to go to war against the BoS.
---
I need a garden gnome horde event
---
😜
---
Capturing workshops and doing the instant defense/retake mission is really fast xp. Just constantly store your junk because you’ll die to a player every now and then but that’s nothing more than a minor inconvenience. Don’t bother building at the workshops either if exp is all you want.
---
Ps4?
---
Plenty of people on here I can have a good conversation with despite disagreeing, and personally I’m probably one of those people you’ve seen defending Bethesda.
---
I don’t put up with arguing for the sake of it though. It wouldn’t even be discussing Bethesda, it would be arguing with me for basing contribution lvls on the minimum amount of players online at any given time and using that to tell someone how much they needed to contribute at the most to do their part for this event.
---
I use this forum to gain information on a game I enjoy. Not argue the applications of math lol
---
4-6 should be enough to suit my needs, thanks a bunch for giving me all those locations, I'll start farming them!
---
At first when I got the recipe for the deathclaw wellington I thought pepper will be the bottleneck but I was very wrong there, this should help me get enough buffs for bosses and such.
---
Nah, it only takes 125,000,000,000 steel to craft
---
Can I get the option to murderize bos instead like I did in fo4
---
SSSShhhhhhh
---
I always turn on Scrapper when getting ready to scrap laser rifles for the extra plastic!
---
Nice!
---
Yeah
---
Why would you be? It’s bethesda’s problem, not ours. They broke it, why not take advantage of it?
---
Cool i can help :) psn thegamerofwizdom
---
Laugh emote, middle finger emote
---
*Rockstar enters the chat*
---
They really should have thrown in like 10 new plans for random base items, even at a 1% drop rate, for this whole event and people would have these turn-ins done so quickly.
---
Cool thank you!
---
Bugs are features in Bethesda games at this rate, we don't get more bugs, we get QoL features.
---
I also play Red Dead Online, so I can safely say "yes." At least Bethesda has some people on here.
---
I can’t fathom what I’m even looking at.
---
With Assaultrons you go for the legs, then the head. With that they are broken and will either die horribly from your gun fire or self-destruct out of cowardice. The only reason they are particularly annoying at the moment is due to Wastelanders seemingly knocking their head lasers back to, possibly above, FO4 levels where the thing could melt you with the greatest of ease. Also seems to be a bit glitched where they fire a hell of a lot more often.
---
My suggestion for basically every enemy sans scorchbeasts (unless they land) is to go with the flamethrower. It burns everything. Its very satisfying to set everything in your path on fire, and it handles groups well which you will absolutely run into during some events.
---
Precisely
---
Agree. There’s so much prewar money, dish rags, and stuffed animals around the world. Cloth will be easy to knock out.
---
Ummm... yay?
---
I am still waiting for Bethesda to have an idea of its own. Stealing the BS seasonal stuff from Destiny 2 and now the war effort WoW Vanilla/Classic. No one wants to farm shit for nothing.
---
There’s only so much caps I can spend on Smiley :(
---
DONT BROADCAST IT
---
Kind of true but this is an exploit, and taking advantage of exploits is a bannable action :/ been banned once with final warning so unsure if i want to do this
---
That is the thinking that got the dupers banned. Do it at your own discretion is my advice. This isn't something you can do accidentally 50 times and bethesda may take this into account when or if they ban people.
---
I blew through 50 mods and not a single unyielding. It knew I was wearing full unyielding. I'm into crafting in my underpants now. Not sure my luck is any better, but it feels good. My next trial will be crafting in a mix of the worst pieces of shit armour I can get my hands on 🤔
---
Oh yeah, forgot that place. Yes, it can have that many, but my point was that it is very difficult to get enough for one turn in from single server.
---
So even 1st solo servers don't help.
---
If a single player can't get 250 from single server, how do we get 150 000 000 in four days? The number is ridiculous and should be tenth of that, with single turn in of 25.
---
Then more would/could participate and there would be a chance of success.
---
Thanks for doing this guys...
---
What's the job?
---
&lt;photo click&gt;  that was it.  Lol
---
Np 😄👍
---
Yes, yes they are.  
---
I'm on a couple other subs and you can effectively take any "Bethesda is bad" post and just find/replace with the correspondent company and no one would notice.  
---
Hell, it once took a Dragon Ball Legends post to be a rant about 76 until I saw "Bandai" about half way down.
---
UPDATE: To be fair to them, it is working again now. You can get into Carleton Mine as normal, on PS4 at least. Not sure exactly when the hotfix was, but I got through Cheating Death with no problems today.
---
Do you mean before or after you miss an entire magazine of 95% shots?
---
I mean it literally is... where do you think we find all the cloth and plastic? Coffin nails = bullets and fusion cells.
---
It's already in the atom shop. It's under the free items section.
---
gtfo with the politics we’re r/fo76 not r/politics
---
Exactly, think of it like the extra month of the NW seasonal rewards. No mistakes only happy little game breaking accidents.
---
I had my first autocomplete since the first week of the season RIGHT AFTER this last patch dropped. Still doing the same things as before that kept me safe all this time and yet the patch screwed those up somehow. I'm honestly just tired at this point..
---
Quality of life.  Such as weight reduction, food takes longer to spoil, etc.  I actually run a QOL heavy gunner build.  I use the gauss minigun.  The ammo is great because all you need are steel and lead.  Steel you get from scrapping enemies weapons, lead you can mine at Lucky hole.  You need acid to turn the lead ore into scrap to craft, but just plunk your base over an acid deposit and maybe pick up some things with acid in them.  I have like 4 weight reduction perks and my carry capacity is 500+.  It's great.
---
Yeah just that it says armor ace there is some hope
---
I get what you’re saying, and I’m not saying you’re wrong, but reentering a building and talking to a dude again is a little different than duping something
---
Next challenge, 1.73 trillion hand pumped waters!
---
It takes doing junk runs where you collect as much concrete as you can and then do an item reset before hopping servers. This lets you maximize your concrete per time. Alternatively you sit on bog town all day collecting concrete from the extractors.
---
Dailies... be prepared to grind, grind, grind
---
You can always look up some yt videos.
---
My policy usually is: 
---
- Find a cool location with some unique variation, whether it a cliff existing structure etc.
---
- create a focal point, open space large room large object
---
-build around it so that your structure highlights that object. If you have a floating box, build some contrasting houses next to it that draw your eye to it, etc.
---
Honestly, this entire situation would have been more manageable if they added an alternate way to donate scrap.
---
Just add "scrap requisitions" that count as a 250 scrap donation as a reward for BoS focused events and dailies.
---
That way, there's an entire other way to grind the community event. And considering there's only like 3 BoS events/dailies, it wouldn't break the "balancing" of the event. It would just give people who justly don't want to give away all their concrete/cork/plastic a way to participate.
---
What type of bloodied rifle do you suggest?

---
I have finally gotten to the point where I can 2 or 3 shot them (my eyes are terrible so I can't really see where exactly I'm hitting them) I'm a stealth rifleman with a Tse lever action
---
These should just be changed to warnings with a Proceed Anyway warning bypass option.  Maybe limit us to 5 bypasses per CAMP deployment.  Most of us have Marsupial and this could lead to some interesting designs.
---
I found this accidentally and thought it may have been an intentional change. I do not believe this can be called an exploit, there's no manipulation of game mechanics here. That being said, this patch has been a disaster. It literally broke the game and didn't fix the things Bethesda claimed to have addressed. I feel bad for the intern who forgot to check Smiley.
---
Retirement plan can end in 2 more ways. Convince the raider to go back, or kill him for even more rep (just slightly, both in favor for raiders). Also raiders have 2 alternating dailies, this and the importance of communication. If you don't finish one in time, at one point you end up with both in your quest journal.
---
Edit: clarified reward faction recipient
---
Is there indication that they want to do this?
---
Yea and no spending caps on fast travel and respawn!
---
I don't think bethesda would see it that way. They gated the amount of bullion for a reason. This isn't necessarily game breaking as it doesn't effect anyone else outside of the person who does it but just be cautious.
---
I’m pretty sure this will be in addition to what we have now. We’ll keep our camps but also get a door to a bunker type room. That’s my interpretation if it.
---
I wonder if that’s the only way they’d implement it? Because they would be obsoleting a lot of items in the atom shop we’ve purchased. I imagine there will be an outer potion instead that uses budget, can be seen in world, etc and an inner portion that is instanced. Just a guess.
---
I think it’s going to be in addition to our above ground camps. I certainly hope so. Not having a camp like we do now, might make me leave the game.
---
Just to clarify.. how did you get the camera and film?
---
I'll see more myself in a bit, lmao buying the game today since it's on sale. But the nukes should be canon atleast, also the concept of the scorch is pretty cool mostly...somewhat
---
AFAIK, the only way to get Settler rep is to have the Former Raider join Foundation. The other ways earn Raider rep.
---
Possibly, though it feels like a stretch to assume they didn't do any math comparing the amount of the resources in circulation vs # of active players...
---
I have had FO1st for 3-4 months now.  In that time, and while grinding  for steel, lead, acid, and cloth, I managed to accumulate 3000+ concrete.  I am sure that there are quite a few other players that have done the same.  It would not take huge amounts of FO1st players to reach 150,000,000 concrete donations if they, too, have thousands of concrete.  So either players have and are not donating, or just don't have it to donate.  Personally I just don't think the players want to give up their accumulated stash of materials like concrete which admittedly take a bit more time to acquire relative to lead and steel.  
---
I have not donated a single thing.  I will not donate a single thing.  I just do not believe the rewards are worth it.  I give away my supplies to new players all the time.  I buy the plans for the fusion generator all the time.  I see a level 2-5 person on the map and I travel to them and drop 400 wood, 400 steel, 400 concrete, and some other smaller amounts of harder-to-get materials along with the fusion generator plan.  I think that is a more beneficial use of my materials than this donation event.
---
I'm not even a fan of the Enclave but I still wanna kill the BOS

I thought they were going to add instanced parts to CAMPS not make entire CAMPs instanced...
---
I agree. Kind of. They could also see it as “no deep SS deep pockets, have some extra gold.” Or maybe that’s just me
---
Math...  We learn it in school for a reason huh? It only takes us a few minutes to figure out what is reasonable for the playerbase based on what we know from playing. It really isn't much to ask for game developers to do the same if they expect us to keep playing.
---
I don't even know what that means.
---
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative. It gets the people going.
---
Given how sloppy QA has been lately, does it really feel like a stretch? :(
---
It's great to see how excited they get about the marsupial serum. Makes me giggle and smile how such a simple thing in a game makes them so happy! Also makes me happy too
---
Yeah, screw this trash game, bugs everywhere I’m uninstalling it.
---
What's the point in making a Laser weapons build if perks are so F'd they can't help?
---
There actually is a slight cool down after it discharges the laser fully. Takes A LOT of getting used to and you are still gonna take damage. Stimpaks help. Trick is to hide behind a wall. Pop out let her start to shoot. Pop out again discharge more.  Then pop out and aim for the legs. She should go down pretty easy but can still shoot on the ground but is slow to turn and aim so get behind her and finish her.
---
Another one of those times where the devs are completely out of touch with reality. I have played the game religiously for a long time, got nearly 1k hours in and all the concrete I got is a mere 800. Or are they seriously expecting us to go server hopping like mad, then resetting the concrete spawns by picking up 255 items and rinse repeat? This is nuts, the people that come with asinine shit like this need to have their positions re-evaluated, maybe they're more suitable for auto-battle mobile games.
---
That may be reaching but by all means knock yourself out and have fun with it while you can, hope you don't get banned. I don't advocate for bug abuse but this is only hurting the people doing it if they end up getting banned.
---
Oh boy.... Looks like someone finally caught me, so all this time I was sending you on the same mission over and over again giving you free reputation, not a bad scam....in theory, but why would we help every vault dweller that comes my way?
---
at some point your stash will fill up (unless you are on FO1st). When it does, try this:
---
1 - pick up *all* your junk from your stash. yes, you will be overencumbered
---
2 - go to a workbench and make sure you scrapped all of it
---
3 - in your pip boy, look at your junk and switch to 'component view'
---
you can now go through the junk list and 'tag for search' anything you are still in need of.  I would try to keep around 90-100 of each junk type on hand and sell or dump the rest. By doing 'tag for search' you will now see an hourglass on in game junk items that provide what you need and you can stop picking up everything.
---
Sneak Attack Damage anf VATs Crits.
---
When did they say September?
---
Need some coffee? You mentioned vital equipment in your post which does give rep. Either way, it's all about maxing 1 faction rep before another.
---
I'd be happy having one of those armor piercing Gutsy's as my ally, those things fuckin shred!
---
So any time I find a likely camp location I’ll drop my module and place foundations evenly spaced along the build parameter. I’ll then put walls 2 stories high on the side of the foundation facing the outside of the parameter. Then I’ll go hit my farming route and check back periodically on my camp, if the camp is damaged I know it’s not safe and I’ll find a new location, if my camp is not damaged after a few hours and a few fast travel visits I know it’s pretty safe from spawns. Using this method I haven’t had to waste any budget on defending my camps in over 8 months. I think in all that time I had to repair one wall cause I low lvl was chased by some wild dogs and ran to my camp.
---
I love the idea of this being a BoS cargo cult. The Paladin will end up being flustered and embarrassed.
---
I have actually run out of notes finally. I didn't think it would ever happen, but with trying to get these dailies done quickly and almost no (!) events in sight it's been quite the pain.
---
in order to make the max caps a day from the robot vendors (1400 caps btw), you may wish to still pickup junk to sell to them. don't scrap the junk first as you will sell it for more that way!
---
Oof can I know what effects are on it? I was thinking about switching to a gauss rifle as a rifleman build but idk the ammo is harder to get so I want to make sure it's worth it
---
Honestly, if you do a run on the Mirelurk Queen for Ohio River, you can gather cranberries there.  Use a fridge and store them.  I try to always have 10 relishes set up.   It’ll be days before they run out.  
---
Cranberry Glade has them too but it isn’t “safe”
---
This is a great junk build. Looks good 👍
---
Sure, but not for heavy gunners.  I'm not saying power armor is better, I'm saying it's better for heavy gunners.
---
Of course they don’t
---
I carry all my junk on my person with 90% reduced junk weight. I think in total all my junk weighs around 40 right now, with 3k+ steel and 1k+ in other resources. In the camp I can't even store all that junk by a long shot. I do only have 100~ concrete on me but I blame that on a massive new base I am attempting to build in my free time. I store anything I don't have weight reduction for in my camp, like extra weapons and aid etc.
---
Rockstar and Ubisoft are nightmares. Bethesda listens much more than most AAA open-world game companies. 
---
Keep in mind, there’s very big difference between not listening to feedback and not implementing it.
---
Those 2 companies don’t listen to it. Ubi has been producing slowly cheaper games for decades with just enough effort every few games to make them enjoyable again for a different playerbase. Rockstar goes by the model of release new content and don’t look back. There stuff is way bette rpolished than Bethesda’s but many of their bugs that do pass through are never fixed. The crew editor that crosses over all their games had dozens of issues till this year that popped up when gta online came out.
---
I really think Bethesda has just been in over their head with their game engine and refused to make a new one. There are too many variables that are constantly changing in the world, and F76’s online requirement has brought those flaws to the forefront. Not to say they aren’t greedy, but the employees(devs and support reps) really do care about their games.
---
Starting to wonder if there is some bot farm being paid a few renminibi per post to just make stupid things like this to act as some negative PR stance because Bethesda slightly makes China look bad in their games.
---
Depends on the use. If you only want something for the occasional pesky out-of-reach; go Lever Action &gt; Hunting &gt; Handmade. If you want something automatic, swap those Rifleman Perks for Commando, and go Fixer &gt; Handmade &gt; Combat Rifle and use automatic receivers.
---
Personally, however, on my Bloodied Melee, I use Bows. Currently have a Bloodied Crossbow with Explosive Arrows and I use Archer/Expert Archer/Master Archer. It does the trick nicely for anything but the annoying Cargobot that carries Nuclear Keycards.
---
I can do it. However a better think to do is have me jump off Grafton Steel into the water.
---

---
Aaronholt homestead for sure, in the lower field next to the road. If you have the Green Thumb perk, you can rake in 20 cranberries from 10 plants. Combine those with gourds for 10% bonus XP for 1 hour. Better than Mamma Dolce's cans. They do degrade over time but last longer than most recipes.
---
Not true man. Have you tried sneak Flamers? The damage is insane.
---
always be scrapping!
---
If I run Uranium fever and waddle over to the train station, I clear about 1000c
---
Wherever you think is best bro. Pm me
---
It's a compensation from Bethesda for players who got screwed by them and wasn't able to buy gold from Smiley for months :D
---
Yes if u look at most game Reddits it’s all filled with people complaining about the little things that make no difference.
---
Again, I get it. I’m not buying it 50 times. I bought it 3 times. And I agree on the bug abuse. But at what point is too much bugs and glitches...to much? I like the game a lot, I’ve played it since Bethesda, but this stuff gets old. It’s constant.
---
Don't worry, you'll still be able to spend your hard-earned or pre-purchased Atoms on the items that don't get rewarded later.  Probably.
---
I assure you, I can melt the sbq in a few minutes, I'm fine for damage.
---
I would use the limb damage one and shoot for the head.
---
Action Boy/Girl max for sprinting AND faster AP regen for more VATS use.  
---
Sneak Maxed. Covert Op Maxed. Ammosmith maxed and only equipped with Super Duper when I'm crafting ammo.  
---
Escape Artist.  
---
If you have an armor piece that has the Chameleon effect it can do some good things. I'm able to lose enemies fairly quickly by going back into sneak. I've had enemies that are in my face and do nothing as I kill them.
---
You are a daredevil for keeping your junk on you. Do you roll with power armor to give you a better chance at staying alive?
---
Around the 6:00 min mark:

He compares the old roadmap with the updated version. They added the ACP event to the patch 22 september roadmap now, at the very end.
---
Wait, what's this now?
---
Aye apocalypse architects represent
---
I just experienced this last night. Holy shit the steel... I won’t be needing any for awhile
---
they certainly see the titles on the hot tab.. occasionally they answer something.. more often than not right after patches drop
---
the caps are for oil purchases.
---
Just because there is a lot of bugs and glitches doesn't give anyone the go ahead to go an do it. I'm not saying this is a perfect game by any means, but it is online and some actions can effect the market and gameplay of others.
---
&gt; It feels like Bethesda just doesn't give a fuck and are just doing what they want 
---
That's because it actually how it is.
---
Sounds rough lol
---
The vertibird one i guess
---
Woo go spending so much time on the tiny details of my CAMP
---
I think we could do this all day, but I don’t wanna 😊👍🏻
---
Probably will come with the patch 22 update now, unless they can turn it on, without needing an update, with colossal problem in the next couple weeks
---
1. Make sure to scrap the junk, un-scrapped junk weights more than scrapped junk. 
---
   1. For now, I'd suggest you keep all your LEAD, ADHESIVE, SCREWS (others may have additional junk so save, these are what I think are basics). 
---
   2. Everything else, if you don't currently need it, bulk it and sell it to the vendors. you will learn over time what is common and not so common over time.
---
2. Scrap duplicates to learn mods for that weapon. Also, what I do when leveling alts is shoot them while they close in, then switch to melee.
---
3. I went into this game blind, and just picked whatever perks seemed appropriate for me at the given time (more carry weight for me). After level 50, you stop gaining SPECIAL points and just pick perk cards or move SPECIAL points around. 
---
   1. You can, of course, try to go for a specific build, but the first question for that is, what is your play-style?
---
   2. Melee, Semi-Auto Rifle, Full-Auto Rifle, Heavy Guns, etc

Dude - I'm separating the quests by which faction they give rep for. I'm aware that Retirement Plan gives rep for both, depending on the outcome. Which is why I listed the specific outcome for the Settlers in my post.
---
It's 100% going to auto complete. The headlines would be too hilarious if it didn't.
---
I have a fridge so they last for ages. But first thing I do when I log in.
---
Stupid things like this? You mean Bethesda continuing to play dumb and just shove more useless filler stuff to the game instead of focusing on the essential ones that have been delayed several times and are now being ninja-delayed, again, without even informing the community?
---
so as a chem user, i will become a feral ghoul should i survive the beginning of the war.
---
I'm not trying to come at your life, I am just simply stating a response to your logic. I hope you have a good rest of your day.
---
One wasteland comes out soon. You’ll have far fewer enemies to run from then!
---
I'm almost at 400 hours and my wife was shocked. I get in about a hour or 2 a day.lol
---
You can only turn in 20 notes at a time...
---
I got a good one to. Put a flamer mod on a chainsaw and decided to terrorize the locals at wayward. Popped in and saw a lvl 7 so I started revving it and running at him. Guy shot me with a pipe pistol so it was game on. I started hitting him with the flaming chainsaw which doesn’t do much damage but he realized he wasn’t going to kill me (lvl 180) so he books it to the wayward bar door and goes in.
---
I started laughing and a couple min later he came back out. My status was in caution so we were both technically engaged. He gave me the thumbs up and I gave him one back. Dropped him 50 super stims to help him out.
---
Guy waves me over to his very basic base and he crafts a weapons table. I’m sitting there thinking he was going to give me something back as a “thank you” which I wasn’t going to take anyways. Then he DROPS A TURRET lmao. Instantly started shooting me.
---
I loved the creativity of trying to win but ended up accidentally killing him with my bloodied fixer when I shot the turret.
---
Wait...you can fast travel to player camps?
---
Would be nice if the new factions have a more interactive good/bad relation then just “we got our eye on you” to outright blasting your ass if you ever step on the brotherhood again. Later pay off brotherhood bounty. But honestly I’ve been wanting to kill foundation and crater on my alts for some time now.
---
Jeff Gardner said the new event is planned for the 16th. I’m not sure where you got September.
---
Just to find out someone with no design experience did it better
---
I had it from another side quest, forgot what it whas called.
---
Most people do not do encrypted events because no matter how hard you try, you can never do it right. People will just bitch at you for not doing it right. So most people just avoid it.
---
Yes. But that doesn't mean these posts are good ideas.
---
Nope, Bethesda should have been f\*cking realistic with their goals. 150 mill concrete and 200 mil Cork? Fat f\*cking chance.
---
Will check them out as well 👍🏻
---
Yes green caps with “V” on the map are player camps :)
---
I don't think you understand just what impact covid actually has had on developers and I'm not just referring fallout and Bethesda, I'm referring to just about every title that's had noticeable delays (Cyberpunk 2077)
---
I'm not defending bad decisions or broken patches (still waiting on my deep pocketed SS limbs) but when you have developers working from home and potentially having to send coding from team to team while also playing husband, wife, father and mother I can appreciate that things take a bit longer, it's better to get a working update than to get a broken one.
---
I’d love for them to add a stripper pole
---
Any official source from Bethesda? Because the last I heard, it was a 2 week delay, which would see it released next week. Which is still August, according to my calendar.
---
Yes, and i think for free if they are on your team.
---
Ok but I still won't do it
---
Best. Challenge. Ever.
---
I'm a sliver away from leveling up in NW too, hopefully tomorrow's challenge is level up since this won't affect it.
---
Is it not always available than ? Because i walked in there quite a lot of times and i never had the quest
---
Oh I always ‘member

Suppose to be August 16th.
---
Hopefully it's a Power Armor Ace.
---
The project lead tweeted its aiming for August 16th.
---
https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1292500285924024320?s=20
---
Edit: they also released an updated roadmap on the 6th so where did you get that its shelved..?
---
Let the Brotherhood of Steel build it their damn selves. I didnt ask them to come to Appalachia. After the crappy rewards for contributing, I may shoot everyone of them I see in the face.
---
Was this different from the Saturday interview? I suck with names
---
I’ve said this a few times as well haha
---
Yeah very much so. I play world of warships. According to reddit; Aircraft carriers are so universally hated that no one plays them and they should be removed, but similatiously they are so popular that you cant get into a game without meeting one.
---
Their captains are so brain numbingly stupid that they only play them because they cant play other classes, but at the same time there's nothing you can do to outplay them, because everyone you meet in one is actually a top 1% elite-pro gamer.
---
Anything that is added/changed "ruins the game", but the meta is "boring and stale". The game has been "dying" for the last 5 years - ever since it came out of Beta.
---
Anything that is announced is literally the worst thing ever, even if no details (at all) have been shown.
---
The only reason wows redditors lose is because of their 11 team mates, who are definitely the stupidest people ever.
---
Wargaming (the dev's) are definitely the worst devs in the history of ever, who dont play their own game, are drunk and are purely motivated by greed (this is a free to play game, that can comfortably be played without paying anything, ever)
---
Oh and somehow the devs are both the most incompetent rambling morons ever who cant do the most basic tasks, but at the same time are programming geniuses that have somehow produced an algorithm that is undetectable, cant be proven or even described that definitely rigs the game against said redditors. Anyone who says different is clearly being paid by WG to shill.
---
Have you read these posts? 99% of them are worth exactly zero fucks.
---
There's gotta be a few magnets inside one of those things...
---
I would rather just shoot Ward in the face!
---
Once a day.
---
Yea that was me pretending to be Bethesda lol
---
Not really. That's 17 days for 1 piece
---
I run the refrigerated backpack exclusively. Helps with food, and stocking up on raw flux.
---
Well known dude
---
It shines when VATS decides to work lol
---
Where can I see that?
---
Garden Gnomes also give concrete scrap, just FYI. The point about its extreme rarity still stands of course.
---
you forgot adhesive! 
---
Since the last level rewards you 500 atoms it is definitely worth it to buy that if you are 3 spaces away. It will literally pay for itself and earn you 50 atoms. Also with all the atoms as rewards they are basically giving everyone credits to purchase at least last 10 spaces or so.
---
You know all those materials you paid monthy for the capability to have as much as you want off. Well we kind of need the materials back. Sorry not sorry!
---
At the rate I am playing it will take me 12 years.  And I got that going for me.
---
Let me suggest Cranberry Relish.   +10% exp for 1 hour instead of +5% exp.   Get the cranberries from the bog south of Watoga where the Mirelurk Queen is in the water.  Get the Gourds and plant them at your camp.  Sugar comes from the Snaptail Reed's, there is a creek along Flatwoods that has them.  Just run up and down that creek.  The dried creek bed closer to the Flatwoods agricultural center has them.
---
Agreed.  Instancing is about killing multiplayer and moving to a solo experience.
---
They informed the community that  Colossus Problem will be delayed in the patch notes.  Reading isn't your strong point is it?
---
&gt; **Please note:** Today’s  update brings the new Public Event “A Colossal Problem” to the game.  However, we are still making some performance tweaks and doing  additional testing before we enable the event. We are planning to make  “A Colossal Problem” available with a follow-up update in the next  couple of weeks. 
---
On top of that the collection event is in regards to the BoS update that is coming.  So the comparison is really shitty.
---
You should be whipped by your troll farm masters and have your dinner of hot water taken away until you learn to do better.
---
Leave me and my exploit alone lol
---
&gt; no one is max scrap.
---
Isn't that just the weight limits?
---
Even worse you are standing in your C.A.M.P. and they ask you to trade.  Check out the damn vending machines!!
---
Sad... I remember the days when one came across a Deathclaw that your hinny would clench so tight that you could shove a lump of coal up there and pull out a diamond!
---
Honestly I don't think that's a bad idea, like for real just fucking seal those fuckers underground
---
inb4 downvotes
---
Be careful there OP, this subreddit does not like it when you bring 'helpful' bugs to Bethesda's attention...
---
Next patch: 'We fixed the max carry weight/power armor bug. The FT bug and the autocomplete bug continue to persist'
---
It’s just one of those “submit the ticket” and move on kind of bugs imo
---
Since 76 launched has there been a time when you actually thought they gave a fuck? The game itself is a big we dont give a fk, nobody asked for a fallout MMO.
---
People are allergic to them there pylons
---
I’m gonna go ahead and call it - any item that doesn’t get unlocked by the community will be part of a ridiculously overpriced Atom Shop bundle. Knowing Bethesda, they’ll probably throw Maxson’s Battlecoat in the bundle too, to get people to buy it. At the end of the day, they’re more concerned with making money than pleasing the community.
---
But you can't use it on other people to my experience
---
I can also type on my keyboard with my feet, but some things in life are too frustrating to try more than once.
---
it did cross my mind that would be a possible outcome with it &amp; items from the LR since some won't make it but if they do i expect a high price tag
---
Yeah the dirt mound thing
---
Concrete can come from gnomes, but it’s still rare, and on top of that, not used very commonly (maybe if you’re building camps, but that’s not something I do, so I can’t speak to that).
---
The only other thing I have to add is that the collectron will likely have a unique function compared to the other collectrons, which all have their own items they collect.
---
Still... this event is ridiculous, especially in terms of concrete and cork. Everything else is common enough that it isn’t a major problem. Leather is found on any hide and certain weapons, along with leather armor, which is common enough. Glass, wood, and plastic are all very common, with enough sources I don’t even need to list them. Cloth... I don’t even know what to say except Dropped Connection, Sweepstakes Handy, and government requisitions. All of those give 20-100 per. Even still, unlike killing scorched or scorchbeasts, donating junk is still our work being dumped in the void for a few items.
---
If they were to fix this event, I’d say for them to actually use all of those resource bins. There’s 3 or 4 at Atlas, so why can’t we just have the ability to donate all of the resources during the entire duration instead of these 4 day sprints?
---
It's all about having the guts to help.
---
Some items gives almost nothing even with scrapper. I can recall Robot and power armor pieces for now.
---
lol, that would be perfect!
---
Kill 1,000,000 fireflies and they'll fix the travel bug.
---
Donate 10,000 mini-nukes and they'll take a swing at rebalancing perks and legendary prefixes.
---
That’s the only reason I do it. But it’s legit 10 seconds haha
---
But now I hear that sound everywhere! In my dreams, when I walk the dog. The search for bobble heads haunts me!
---
Why? Its simpler than most other challenges
---
Yes you can. It might’ve been updated since the most common occurrence you’d see it was when reviving a player it would prioritize cannibalism forcing you to kill them rather than reviving them
---
I'm not happy about Biden either, but I feel like you're kind of ignoring the current POTUS who just recently had to use both arms to lift a glass of water
---
So it fails.
---
Ah yes, because its a daily quest. But it never started and i never did it. Thats weird right ?
---
Sometimes if there are only two shots left and I want to reload my Gauss Shotgun I have to use bash.  Stupid
---
Wait how do you place a sink inside the counter?
---
I had this this morning, couldn't join a sever at all.
---
Quit game and reopened, then it gave me trial expired error.
---
I'm on PC and linked Bethesda to Steam. But was launching the game from Bethesda.
---
Had to open up Steam, log out and log back in to fix.
---
I don’t think I’ve ever even seen anyone wearing any beret in game.... how lazy are they for putting in a bunch of them?!
---
yes poorly designed event.....steel...ok.......you just scrap weapons off kills.......but concrete? weighs  too much to randomly grab and too scarce to start with.......plus no real value in the rewards.....they should have had new unique BOS related plans and mods that no one already owned......but booze...really?
---
I love the game but who ever set up this event failed.
---
Same here.  I don’t even know if items like the camo jumpsuit have a chance to drop in those events. But I fool myself into believing that maybe it can
---
plot twist: BOS doesn’t return due to not enough materials. bethesda:better luck next update!
---
I have thousands of cloth I'll donate.  I make my own ammo and still have a metricassload of cloth.
---
Concrete, I'll donate what I've got, but it's nowhere near what I've got in cloth.
---
Heck I can go on cloth runs that net hundreds if not thousands of the stuff.  You just need to know where the money piles are.
---
It was made with pvp so we want it fixed, cupcake
---
Lol damn I was there last night buying modules and went all the way to whitesprings to craft some gauss miniguns wish I would have looked
---
They tweeted today it’s on track for week of August 16. Some random person making assumptions is not exactly reliable.
---
you are one of the dumbest people on the server don't like it play a different game you were so fond of outer worlds what happened where's your 1000s of hours of game play and your not getting it they aren't gonna bend a knee to you this is an optional event but if we succeed the legendary perks and bos update get pushed forward
---
I meant in power armor to save cores 🤦‍♂️
---
I had about 12k concrete and bumped in about 2k and it didn’t matter. Lol you can tell the devs dont play the game. Hell watching them try to play the wendigo colossal told me they’re noobs for sure. Nobody who plays this game thought 150m concrete and cork were doable. Now it’s just wait to see if we fail the whole challenge because of this or does it just skip to the next week. 
---
It’s not like Atlas won’t be rebuilt in game lol they need it for the soon to be delayed brotherhood dlc.
---
I'm a dad and had taken about 25 years off video games but my boys got me into fallout 4 and I thought that was great. I wasn't really into the idea of 76, I had no previous experience with an online game and I'll admit it the idea of it seemed weird, but fallout 4 had run it's course and I needed some new content. There was a learning curve but once I realized you can interact with other players as much or little as you want I thought it was great and definitely filled the fallout void for me, especially just wandering around and exploring the map. I work out of town a lot, sometimes for weeks, and one day the light bulb went off, "I wonder if I bought a second Xbox if I could play with the boys when I'm away? "And damn it worked! Bought my first headset and we play a few hours every night. And I can tell you you're lucky to get 5 mins of talking to kids on the phone, but when we're playing fallout together we talk for hours. I know it sounds cheesey, and there are plenty of bugs with this game, but for what it's worth but it brought us closer together. Can't hurt to try right?
---
Pretty sure you don't get treasury notes when you do that though
---
I would like to be able to settle in an empty house in Morgantown or somewhere else
---
He looks over select (adventure) ok, (private) uh hmm, (neclear winter) gah! Kill it!
---
You dont get the treasury notes if the queen shows up, I believe.
---
I didn't look at what a bag of concrete weighs ingame, good math :) I just went with the standard 80 lb real world bag, of course.
---
It takes so long...
---
It gets worse, with this shit you can repeat the challenges as often as you like. 
---
I really hope this gets fixed ASAP
---
I don't think you can destroy your camp with a weapon. And others can only do it while in pvp with you. The flamer thrower is doable by yourself
---
Do the "place a CAMP" challenges too, you can place it multiple times in quick succession in the same spot and it'll count. Almost as quick and easy as taking a photo.
---
Has that not always been the case? I remember using it a few weeks ago, may have been a month or two ago at this point
---
Assholetrons and mirelurk kings and mole rats are my least favorite.
---
I can’t even log in now, it’s just slamming “Authentication failed” in my face,
---
I am on ps4, just to mention
---
I mean yeah, if you don’t want treasury notes.
---
that's very hurtful.
---
It's a mutation.  Believe it or not we had them in the single player called New Vegas under the guise of traits
---
If you place an item on top of another, then move the bottom item (so it moves both items) and place it on uneven ground so part of the model sinks in, the item stacked on top will descend into the bottom object. Its also how I put the toolboxes and stuff on the shelves.
---
the consequence is the BOS update gets pushed back another month
---
I can do 2 mil screws... I can make screws.
---
CAMP Instances are most likely going to be in -addition- to what we have now, allowing for a bigger budget inside as it won't put extra strain on the server. After all, they need to increase budget somehow so people keep buying stuff from the Atom Shop.
---
Ya that would work. However, i dont think you get treasury notes if it fails.
---
Armor ace... it’s clearly Ghillie skins for every model of Power Armor
---
I don't want that! Would be an excuse for significantly less content if they are less developed! Hopefully they have something set in place and the community challenge is just a fun initiative for new awards.
---
Okay do you like shotguns/rifles/large explosive/energy or ballistic guns?
---
Do you place it the same way you do in adventure mode or do you need to find it or something?
---
Week of* but yes
---
thats too cheap to cherry pick legendary effects IMO
---
The seedy shed is the only atom shop item you can place in other players camps
---
I think you’ll live and I doubt you’re hurt.
---
Cannot imagine why.
---
"It this an out of season april fools joke?"
---
Yeah I only keep about 50 concrete in my stash at a time. I tend to not pick up every piece of junk anymore only what I’ve “tagged for search”
---
I definitely only have 30 concrete in my stash currently, so I can’t even donate one box’s worth of it
---
Sure I'm interested in a fixer.
---
Gotcha. Yeah, it can eat through the cores pretty quickly. I just use Batteries Included and regularly hold one of the power station workshops to make sure I have a ton.
---
Maybe you need to do other quests first?
---
Wait do you mean to tell me that random YouTubers aren't a good source of information? I was wondering why every time I watched those how to basic videos I ended up smashing eggs all over my floor.
---
Seriously though it staggers me how many people take these clickbait YouTubers so seriously.
---
I know how to do the conduit rug shelf one but I've never heard of putting a sink into a counter, doesn't the bottom object get red and you can't place it?
---
there's a glitch you can do where you never have to track down the guy again and the items just spawn in your inventory
---
The diseased kings are especially bad, as they often infect you with rattle hands on the first hit, instantly reducing your ranged damage output by 25%.
---
I dont know which one, i completed all the main quests, i know this quest would be triggered after you completed it all..
---
For the SBQ? Don't waste your time or gold. Now the gauss minigun does some nice damage but my go to for her is a legendary handmade that I primed. I ping her with the prime handmade to get her attention, stop firing until she lands and then whip out the gauss minigun to knock down her health bar.
---
Exactly like adventure mode, and you don't have to build anything, just place it. What I always do is spawn on the outskirts, place it as soon as I have control, turn like 60 degrees in either direction, place it again, rinse repeat as many times as the challenge asks for. Once I get the confirmation I hop out and back to adventure mode (although I reenable my mods and restart the game first; I've got batch files for it now purely for NW).
---
Welcome!
---
1. Scrap your junk and stash your scrap.  Don't store junk in your stash unless it is for your display cases as it consumes more stash space.  Keep 50-100 of each scrap in your stash (Fallout 1st provides a Scrap Box with unlimited storage for scrap so it doesn't use your stash limit FYI) until you notice you use a certain type of scrap more often, then increase how much of that you store to say 200 or 300.  
---
DON'T carry scrap or junk around because you will lose it when you die.  
---
DON'T hoard weapons and armor you are not using or going to use soon.  
---
IF any kind of consumable like aid or ammo sits in your stash or inventory too long, sell it, you're not using it, and if you can't sell it to robots put it in a vending machine at a low price, or just drop a bag at a train station or at Overseer's Camp.
---
2. You can make ammo at a Tinker's Bench - from all that scrap you've been hoarding.  Always be on the lookout for better armor so you take less damage, and try to engage enemies from further away.  You can scrap or sell duplicate weapons based on what you need more, caps or scrap.  Try to get the Scrapper perk to get more scrap out of scrapping weapons and armor.
---
3. [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)  
---
Your build can be planned in advance but you need to know what weapon class you will specialize in.  Many people here will help you with your build then you can use the Level Up Guide at the bottom of this Character Build Planner to follow to pick the right perk at each level up.
---
I’ll have to test that out. You still complete the event so I don’t know why you wouldn’t get the TN.
---
Pretty sure the way I took it was you’d have your normal camp than a like “ bunker “ door leading to an underground kinda box. I was hoping they would do like a server base say like you and your squad get a base / house to set up.
---
I wish there was more assaultrons roaming the wastelands
---
You keep all your junk on you? Like... all of it?
---
I've got anxiety just thinking about this.
---
Thank you for telling me!
---
Assaultrons, go for the legs, they are super weak
---
Sentry Bots, one sneak crit to the fusion cores = instant kill
---
Colonel Gutsy, hit em in the jets, couple hits = instant kill
---
Robobrain, headshots obviously. 
---
Protectron, light em up.
---
Thank you, but I finally moved to PC.
---
What does the bug have to do with being a stealth build?
---
How would anyone know? No one has delivered concrete.
---
Now would be a time for the duppers to bring us all the concrete and cork lmfao
---
Why bow over guns? Just personal preference or is there a performance reason?
---
I ain’t donating concrete it’s a bitch to get
---
Same way as adventure. So on PC its TAB (pipboy), Z (c.a.m.p), click to place.
---
Do that, move forward 10 feet, repeat. You can do the place 3 camps in under 10 secs at the start of the game.
---
This guy is a karen.
---
I really like adhesive! :)
---
If you find a bug, especially a useful one you should submit to Bethesda and not advertise it here. Showing how to exploit is against this subs rules, which is why they get downvoted.
---
i need .45 ammo
---
I can’t help the BoS and defeat Zorbo at the same time.
---
Woah, hey there. The maroon one with patrolman sunglasses and the tee-shirt and slacks makes for an excellent Boone.
---
Amen, brother.  I have a shrine to the wise mothman on my camp
---
Yeah, I had 13K steel but only 1100 concrete
---
On pc, no issue with game board :/
---
Yeah it's a pretty god damn sad oversight.
---
Nah. Xbox. Got a guy in a hazmat suit, another guy in PA, and then downed a lady in wood armor and let the fire take care of her.
---
r/fo76: They're going to cheat and auto complete anyhow!
---
Also r/fo76: HAH! Knew it wouldn't finish!
---
The frick are you talking about I’m fo1st and try to pick up everything but o only had 500 concrete. And I gave it all away. And now I have none. Thanks Bethesda.
---
no just back to the normal spawns they where increased during wastelanders to get gold bullion notes in circulation
---
"I'm honestly suprised that I haven't seen this problem adressed on here at all."
---
It's mentioned several times a day.
---
allowing cherry picking of legendary effects should be so expensive its right at the borderline of not even worth it AFAIC..
---
If not fascist they are technocrats atleast. It's either their way or the highway. So cool you could attack them with artillery as a good guy minuteman in Fo4. But if you ever wondered if they are fascist try taking either nick valentine or Hancock with you and try to hear their reactions.
---
Known issue, said they'll resolve it in the next patch.
---
Yea I’m not sure what they were thinking about some of these supplies, I only had 300 concrete because it’s not something I go out of my way to get. I’m a big BoS fan and would love to get the banner, but there’s no way.
---
Gotta stop fighting over those workshops and leave them unlocked.
---
Are you a bad Chatbot? Wtf is that even supposed to mean? The words are English, but the meaning is unparsable .
---
Bloodied is only equaled by junkies
---
nope the only killable faction will be the Enclave
---
Pay for a 1st subscription and invite 7 of your friends.  Done!
---
The event is considered failed. 
---
Tried it a few times cause I needed the queen meat. 
---
No treasury notes.
---
They should have just done some of the ores, like black titanium, why the fuck would the brotherhood need cork
---
Its cause you fail the primary of stopping the horde.
---
Maybe they'll finally fix all the bugs with the alien blaster and give it stats to make it viable outside the forest. What am I saying, of course not, they already released a $5 skin for it last year without fixing either of those issues
---
Juicehead talked about it in one of his videos. Hopefully it will get fixed soon. Hell of a bug for new players, or returning players with new characters.
---
Because the enemy doesn't change into a legendary until it is aggro'd? I can't speak for other builds but typically I one-shot kill thanks to my stealth perk card.
---
If this happens to non-stealth builds, check one for the list... seems its a bigger bug in that case.
---
Let me know when you're doing being a mean person.
---
you guys wear power armour too and worse off yours looks kinda dumb
---
If the camp is a trash heap of floating shit that's hard to navigate then they don't deserve your caps anyways.
---
Send em a nuke instead.
---
I mean, I wouldn't mind seeing houndreds of ammo factories at a workshop....
---
Not concrete but steal and you get a crate for donations  not rep and even if It did give rep why would doing something for bos give you rep for raiders or settlers. You no damn well you were just blowing smoke to mess with the guy.
---
your gonna have to do the donation for enclave too
---
Well, given their history, when 76 does die I am willing to put down on digital paper that they'll either release server code to let people keep playing privately, or (less likely) they'll release a clientside version. But honestly, I doubt it'll go anywhere any time soon. They're making so much money off this game, r/fo76 rants be damned.
---
I spawned on the edge of the map and went to go grab some food. Literally didn't even have to play I'll take the free easy score and then get the gameplay I want after while I eat my Taco's
---
nope
---
Sure, that's why a third of the way through the event or whatever they set the "real" progress to a whopping three percent.
---
Do you think this is the first time a game would miss a community goal or something?  I remember years back Blizzard was running a similar thing for one of the expansions for Hearthstone and a bunch of fucking idiots like you flooded reddit and everywhere else with conspiracy theories that the whole system was rigged to autocomplete and nothing anyone did mattered and they actually managed to get the community on their side to prove that if no one did anything it would still finish right on schedule.  
---
Of course the goal failed and they looked like a bunch of idiots and everyone went back to just doing the event.
---
It’s just there to show you how long you’ve been playing, just like Steam does. I really dunno why people have to make a huge fuss about a few dollar’s worth of atoms for literally just playing the game and nothing else.
---
Something something African or European scorch beasts monthly python reference.
---
My guess is when you enter an area and one shot the enemies.   Only after the smoke is clearing you get an enemy has mutated message.    At that point it’s to late and no legendary for you.
---
*cries in Portable Power*
---
Seriously though, good catch. People are right though, it will most likely be changed pretty quick, if they can. It will be labeled an Exploit and it seems anything labeled an Exploit is fast tracked. Not being cranky about all the bugs, its really how it seems to work. I'm surprised the whole power armor trick to get through doors hasn't been fixed yet, its going to be rough around here if it ever is. Seems to be the most popular route to farm SBQ and eventually Big Earl.
---
How do you guys check how much was donated and what rewards you get when the target is achieved??
---
I prefer the Meat Week banner flag anyway :)
---
Personal preference. Mostly to keep it more "Melee-y" but also because my character is full-on Jason Voorhees and I try to use only weapons he has used/would use.
---
Really hope for that to be the case! 
---
Would be even better if we could use some of the assets from the Enclave events, namely robot patrols (Mr Gutsy &amp; Assaultron units, as well as orbital strikes) while doing so.
---
enclave eye bots are bribing you to join
---
Usually 1 or 2 in Hopewell Cave as well. Just know that they are able to be damaged... Meaning, if one is on the ground, and you use a shotgun to kill the Deathclaw there, the egg turns into a Broken DC Egg.
---
I’ve turned up before and only the queen was there (only me at the event too) and I got the notes.  Also I’ve done it a few times now where I’ve killed everything but it doesn’t t switch to the next horde.  Can run around too incase one is stuck somewhere but nothing.
---
Yeah, to be fair though I was buffed up with multiple melee damage and strength buffs as well as unarmed perk and bloody mess as I was doing the queen a bit earlier and unarmed is the focus of my build.
---
But I agree that it's kind of sad that bears or even crickets are much scarier than a deathclaw for their high speed 360° backbreaking stagger and sneaky poison attacks respectively.
---
I have a Bloodied 1\* Gauss Shotgun, funny that I got not one but two 2\* Bloodied regular Shotguns from the SBQ yesterday.  I wish I got as many Unyielding pieces as I did bloodied.
---
I didn't even know there was an event till I came here.
---
every day
---
what console are you playing on that it's so horrible
---
Gross.
---
I see
---
So much this uf event + scrapper = crazy steel and wood
---
Pretty sad to see how much you got downvoted for just stating the truth. These idiots really think it’s just fine that the numbers aren’t updated for 2 days in a 4 day long event, as if that’s even an excuse, and like it doesn’t take 5 minutes to “manually update the numbers.” These people treat Bethesda like a spoiled child rather than a multibillion dollar company that couldn’t give the slightest shit about its fan base anymore.
---
After 2500 hours (and lacking other content) I've not taken to learning all I can about the camp system, have masters circular camps and have just started working on more advanced methods using blueprinted stairs (meshed over each other) to make quad and octa - sets on one tile. Current camp is a pyramid made of nuka cola stair stacks. Its fun and something different...certainly beats farming unachievable amounts of concrete or cork!
---
You can already do this.  You can buy the plan for a weapon or armor and craft it at different levels.
---
Regarding Legendary effects, no, I'm sorry, these are supposed to be rare.  However, you can get almost anything you want through the right trade communities or your clan.
---
Oh, could you tell me what you know about the broken egg mechanics, as I was in that cave today and only got broken ones, I guess a black poder rifle destroys them without a hit? I'm not sure how I can avoid it, I was assuming they were like mirelurk eggs in that respect, that they need to actually take damage
---
Yeah. The in game image assets dont even match the in game weight. The image is more in line with a 40-80lb bag than a 5 lb bag.
---
For a cheating mod that's just asking for trouble, looking for more on the visual side of things.
---
Bring it.
---
You can already do it on Xbox!
---
Salty is my middle name! 😁
---
I don't know. I sort by new. That way I don't miss out on information and end up posting about well-known issues, acting like I'm the first one to know about it.
---
I’ll upvote but the bloodied gang will burn u alive
---
Is it the correct camera you have? I know there’s 2 types and need to have it on you.
---
So for example... I run into Fort Defiance... the ghouls are sleeping... I run by and as they are slowly awakening from their slumber. I shoot them and they die, then suddenly glow and turn legendary as their corpse falls. I can still loot their hairbrushes and diluted rad-x but no legendary? How do we get around this? Run the entire building and wait for them to gang bang us at the end of a hallway?
---
Are you seriously trying to say the *BONUS INT* is the problem with bloodied, and not the fact that the damage is completely imbalanced compared to everything else aside from a 5-addiction junky?
---
I thought it was under floor decor if my memory is serving me correctly.
---
Dont. Go fishing with him instead, better use of human time.
---
yey
---
Bonus INT is not the core of what makes bloodied OP. It's the shitload of buffs that stack once you go below 20% health.
---
Bet ya don't.
---
&gt; Maybe if [u/BethesdaGameStudios](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaGameStudios_/) changed it to a light-up stripper pole that our ally NPCs could dance on...we "might" dump 145 million more concrete in 2 days.  
---
This killed me
---
Guess we'll know in a few days, won't we?
---
Make sure you still have the camera on you! I thought it was a bug that it wouldn’t start but then I got my camera and it worked!
---
That's always the most frustrating part of trying to kill an assaultron at long range, no matter what you do the thing's just gonna turn around and blast you with laser after laser from across the field with pinpoint accuracy. And if there's nothing to take cover behind, you're screwed.
---
hmmmm...you’re absolutely correct. Buuut I guess I am not at the level of having soooooooooo many legendaries that I’m just spamming to scrip them. They are usually heavy and my pack fills fast. I am hitting the station pretty frequently.
---
Would be nice to get the actual camp items that are military (that are in base game). Items like the thin OD green defense wall, the large mini-nuke case, small green ammo can, a camp assaultron/sentry, a rusted tank/jeep, crashed vertibird and a bunch more.
---
*angry bloodied noises*
---
Now I want that NPC stripper pole.
---
Take all my concrete.
---
Do you have an injured limb? Have you healed with a stimpack? That could limit damage but I'm not sure if it could be as bad as it sounds like it is. I haven't seen any reports of broken perks from this patch and they did fix adrenaline. My commando build hasn't suffered any drop off in damage. I have the rifleman perks but haven't tried them out in a long while.
---
You can test the armor thing by attacking low level scorched or ghouls since they have little to no armor rating. You should hit them for full damage.
---
I have lost 20k score due to the autocomplete bug. I messaged support and they did absolutely nothing. They said if I didnt respond to their email within 96 hours they would consider it "resolved" I responded twice in that timeframes and they never got back to me after the initial email saying they were looking into the information. 
---
Terrible customer service.
---
Oh, and one of the days I lost was during double Score (which was a "fix" for this issue) week along with my weekly challenges as well for that week.
---
I came back after wastelanders dropped and was really enjoying the game, but the issues with the Legendary Run and this event are really souring my experience. Very good chance that unless they do a meaningful fix I will cancel my 1st subscription and uninstall the game.
---
That is good to know! Thanks 👍🏼 an easy 250s
---
They're dealing with Bloodied in good way... Adding in mobs specifically designed to exploit it's weaknesses.. Floaters for example.
---
Might want to, its a good trick to have up your sleeve. I actually heard about the assaulting helmet trick on here and they patched it out before i had a chance to try it. Thanks for sharing it though, its a good catch.
---
Stop and think for a minute.
---
Damage can be rebalanced. You can buff other bonuses. Hell you can nerf bloodied. But what CAN'T be tweaked right now is the exp gain advantage bloodied has over everything else. This creates a disincentive to ALL other builds which cannot be tweaked away.
---
Yeah launch an all out assault on the BoS Atlas observatory!
---
Enclave members(Vault76 dwellers in scout armors and X-01 power armors) + Encalve robots Vs Chump BoS weaklings in combat armors and baby t-45 power armors.
---
Also: Plasma &gt; Lasers
---
You have way more patience than I do, I would have pulled out my Assassins Deathclaw on him.
---
This whole thing is weird. We're getting concrete for some fanboy's job application, and nobody even knows if they're hiring?
---
I'm not 100% sure, but I've seen whole eggs in there, blasted the DC as it dropped down, and watched/heard the eggs break. Using my Gause Shotty mind you.
---
If trying to preserve them, I'd suggest getting the DC to spawn, then backing out of the cave and getting him to follow before taking it down.
---
Unfortunately, Bethesda only ever seems to pay attention to posts that make the front page under 'Hot' or 'Top'. To be fair, I think they'll be waiting all the way to patch 22 to fix this bug. In the meantime, the best content in 76, Wastelanders, is inaccessable to all new players.
---
nah.... mole rats, scorpions and fucking yago bears
---
Really no other option other than getting better weapons that can take them down quickly. if you don't want to go bloodied just get a magic shotgun and have a good day.
---
I have the pro deluxe snap camera, did not know there was another. Do you know the name of the other one ?
---
X-01 &gt; T-45
---
👎🏻
---
Or you know, sleep and eat cranberry stuff/meat stew like the rest of us..
---
Not rocket science dude.
---
For me it just says execute but I'll try again.  I'll be pretty happy if that's true but for reference Um on xbox
---
Only on the PTS. I don't think they have a scheduled release for the actual game yet since they are reworking it.
---
Floaters can be annihilated from 40 yards away by a bloodied stealth commando with a silenced automatic gun. Earl will definitely hurt bloodied builds. Neither floaters nor Earl will change the fact that if I don't run bloodied I will be gaining half, or less, exp.
---
Donated a couple K in steel, was barely able to scrap up the 250 for concrete. And that was what I was deliberately storing before the event started, which I only ended up donating because I still had it on hand before I knew the event reward sucked. For the rest of the events I am just gonna bulk it up and vendor sell it.  
---
I DON'T EVEN LIKE THE BOS!!
---
You want fun? This isn't that kind of game.
---
The devs play bloody so....
---
"I see you have our missing property."
---
ULTRACITE&gt;X-01
---
also standard issues is T-51 and T-60
---
Thx!
---
I thought it was only for beta testers or something right now.  Anyone can?
---
I had someone message me yesterday for gun powder and I just sat there thinking "what??? It's everywhere."
---
They might’ve changed it. Like I said, the game prioritized the cannibalism perk over reviving, so if it was equipped it was impossible to revive anyone. They may have changed this
---
legendary run
---
Yeah I'll try it, the thing is it does make sense with a gauss shotgun as it has explosive/aoe damage, but my black powder rifle shouldn't, I'll make sure to check the place out a few more times and lure the death claw to be melee killed
---
I'm old, foul-mouthed, and play on PS4...
---
PSN: brindancall13
---
The devs don’t play the game.  Nobody in the decision chain for an absurd amount of concrete (and cork, and plastic, etc) has enough knowledge about the game to say “hold up, this is an order of magnitude beyond reasonable”
---
If you watched the event stream, this is a pretty bad one-two PR punch combined with the stream.  Not only did they look clueless playing their own game, but they also got the fast travel bug.
---
I don’t expect devs to live in their work.  I do expect them to dabble in it, experience what the players experience, and address the obvious issues that annoy them the most playing, as it has to annoy players too.  The customers.  The people that you are trying to keep around.
---
I’m to the point where I think the people working on this game actively loathe this game and the people playing it.  Each week is a new slap in the face to those of us that have stuck through thick and thin, or that have heard enough positive to finally give it a shot.  How much of a disaster is the next patch going to be?  Make an absurd guess, it may come true!
---
When you grow up and stop being a dick.
---
So I guess never
---
What people don't realize is that bloodied is literally supposed to outclass every other build in terms of damage, but at the cost of very low health. No shit, a full health junkies build shouldn't be doing as much damage as someone running at 15% health with unyielding armor. As a bloodied build, I find myself dying all the time, both from my own gauss shotgun and rads. Maybe a more effective way to balance it would be to lower the health threshold for unyielding. I think there just needs to be more perks for other builds, not necessarily change the existing ones.
---
That's what the atoms every ten or so levels are for, I figure.
---
well. I have a lot but i have a lot of every scrap materials. I just like high numbers :) I donated 40k steel and already have 13k back so it is not a problem but i have no idea how to collect a lot of concrete back. Maybe they forgot to change reward pool so players like me wont donate any bcz u just got overweight with few hundreds of booze, stimpacks and granades.
---
Well the problem is i have it on me haha
---
Everybody gangsta til being a raider is more than just a costume choice right?  Let's go have a picnic in our grimiest outfits lololol
---
You need to activate it on your console. Download the official Android App, Xbox Game Streaming and it'll walk you through it.
---
Maybe they should get gud.
---
I collect and scrap tooooooooonnes of stuff with 1st and I just went to check my stash box to see how much I can donate, expected at least 2k concrete... I had 516 concrete.... I'm starting to think my stashbox has a hole in the bottom.
---
Don't get your hopes up bud, legendary players was slated for summer last year. It's been pushed back and pushed back again. I did read that next patch will be juicy though, so there's that.
---
They should start trading on LFG and see how that goes...
---
Why are you so angry over a video game?
---
    It would not be so bad if you didn't get stuck with a 1 * roll
---
I just wish people would either stop putting the rad shower in the doorway to their vendors or make an alternate "bloodied" entrance. 
---
I know it's not my place to tell people how to set up their camps but I'm not walking through that shit regardless of how easy it is to rad up. It's The Principle of the whole thang. There's Principalities In This.
---
I've never been able to get mine. Maybe power armor would give him enough time to pick it up? That sucks dude.
---
Oh yikes! Maybe drop it and pick up again? Make sure you have lots of camera film? Hope it works out for you soon :)
---
this is a smart shitty move.
---
The thing with assaultrons is that they only have one long range option which is the head laser, which they will spam the ever loving hell out of whenever you try to kill them at longer ranges, and other than that they can only attack you at melee range. So I've just been taking the fight right to them and pounding their heads in with my melee weapon. Thing is, you also have to keep some form of cover nearby, because that laser will _destroy_ you if you get caught in it.
---
I feel like you belong on another post entirely.  Everyone agrees the weapon jiggle needs to be reduced.  That's why there's a mod for it in FO4
---
Hey this guy did something i didn't like so i saved the game by griefing him and destroying his base
---
I'm not complaining about bloodied damage or the cost of running bloodied. I'm complaining about how bonus int, which doesn't effect combat, gives bloodied a significant advantage over all other builds.
---
Removing bonus int won't nerf bloodied in combat.
---
I can only get Blackeye's daily. Fishbones won't give me his again after the first time. I've heard others have this problem as well.
---
trying to hoard all the resources is why they were unpopular before
---
Realistically picking prefix would cost *at least* 10 times that, as chance to get what you want is 1/18.
---
It's never going to happen anyway... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Enemies spawn as legendaries, they dont suddenly become legendary at a random time
---
Im a stealth build, and ive never run into this issue
---
You should write a detailed ticket to bethesda, and include evidence like photos proving they weren't legendary until dead
---
Watoga shopping center has a few bags too.
---
A new... member... has joined the club.
---
He's pretty much SOL if it's too far into the fissure.
---
The pumpkin one? Pretty sure that’s savage divide
---
There it is!  Thx!
---
Yeah, but the bloodied builds can do that too and stack it on top of the int buff, I know I do plus brain fungus soup. It is still way easier to get experience as a bloodied build. I do think that they need to buff other legendary prefixes to make them more viable/give them better synergy with perk cards. I do not disagree with his point that it is a little unfair to the folks that don't want to be bloodied but want to get the high exp numbers since  we can stack all the same buffs that non-bloodied folks do but then also get the INT bonus from Unyielding.
---
This is correct, you can't damage your own camp objects.
---
Destroyed objects are very finicky so if you can't place another object inside it, then it probably won't happen.
---
I’m not too sure but I’m on later to check.  Also have you completed the wasteland mission?
---
Why suck even more of the fun out of the game? Bethesda needs to introduce more buffs, not nerfs. PVP is pretty much gone from the game, why treat adventure mode like a competition?
---
Yes. This has happened to me about a dozen times. Happened again today.
---
oh ffs
---
right. when  you drop something on the ground a bag appears. if you move away a little bit and drop something the bag you drop the moves to the new spot. so if he drops something no the floor close it MAY move the bag to the new spot.
---
but.. i don't know. worth trying. get him to drop like a round of ammo
---
also tell him to sort his stash out and carry whatever is in his stash and put the junk in there.
---
If you have junkshield on for tier 2 and carry a bunch of weights, leadweights are best, and you use the perk you can become practically  invulnerable, pop some sunshine oil and rad ex and use a suit of power armor with a jetpack, then you can retrieve your items
---
Thankyou !! :)
---
Basically can contract diseases.
---
Aqua boy/girl prevents rads, but not diseases.
---
Only a wetsuit will prevent the diseases in water.
---
Preach it! Done to me and I was sorely tempted to nuke his camp. Had over 8 minutes before timer ran out and turd blossom showed up, ran to computer to start it. Just him and I... then he jumped on the roof, clearly indicating that he wasn't going to be the conduit.
---
Abandoned Big Town: Second floor or large red building near Workshop. Several bags of concrete.
---
I once launched a nuke on half of a server i was gonna get off after killing a queen after my nuke launch someone did it before me even though they got to a different silo after me so I waited till they killed that one and launched it
---
Stupid me didn't discover the scrapper perk until level 250 and it was a game changer when it comes to having steel on hand.  I went from farming to having an average of 7000 in my stash.   Now if lead was this easy.
---
I agree with you on that. I was more-so replying to some posts I've seen complaining about why junkies/ full health x/y/z don't compete with bloodied in terms of damage output. They shouldn't.
---
Also might be I'm missing something, I haven't done those quests for a while
---
Nope, not using the clean sink from the legendary run anyway.
---
It’s a pain in the arse because it’s one of the easiest to get notes from lol
---
Great, now their BOS base is going to be a floating base with no foundations.
---
You need a shot at redemption.  Don't want to end up a cartoon in a cartoon graveyard.
---
I would just like the Whitespring fountain in my camp!
---
It's not a matter of it countering but one of shear mass!
---
They could blot out the sun with those millions of cork and that includes your weapons muzzle! Better not donate or they might just fill all your barrels.
---
A few days?  Jesus Christ.  No... you'll know in less than 24 hours, the concrete phase ends at 10:00am CT tomorrow.
---
Have you finished the Wastelanders quest line and raided the vault?
---
That's the problem.  No one knows that, and these teary eyed 40 year old sweaties don't bother to learn how pvp works so they get their big boy feelings epically hurt when they get jumped in their excavator armor in a workshop.  I'm detecting a pattern here...
---
Im sorry, what do you mean ?
---
Yess i did, all of them
---
Some will say the 50cal. Others will say the lmg. Gauss minigun is popular too. Give them all a try and see which one you like.
---
Bloodied or junkies are the highest damage effects. But furious is good, too.
---
Explosive or faster fire rate are the "best" secondary effects. Certainly the most popular.
---
Ghouls are former vault dwellers running a junkies/bloodied build. Once they became ghouls the radiation healed off of them
---
This person gets it.
---
The person that has her agro needs to be on the ground, and if she’s just flying around nobody has done enough damage to get her attention.  In that case, pop her a few times and run to an open spot. She’ll sit on your face.
---
Are you talking about public workshops?  Those are PvP battlegrounds.  Not for you to "beautify."  If you have to build anything it would just be some resource collectors, generators, power lines, maybe some turrets.  You can blueprint a defense platform with most of it but don't include the Scrap Box because it screws up deployment.  The requirement to build is part of the rush, you could be attacked at any time while setting it up!
---
Rookie numbers lol I’ve almost got 10k of most things I have too much time on my hands.
---
Np :) easy SCORE, had to pass it along
---
Monorail near Fort Defiance. Several bags of concrete and lead at top of elevator, end of trian carriage. Watch your step and scrap at Fort Defiance, 4th floor, BOS area.
---
You might want some radshield instead but I've tested it before and it works
---
The slotted spoon can catch the potato
---
It's honestly kind of heart-warming. It's as if the community realized that there was ZERO benefit to turning this much scrap in, and decided against it. If Bethesda had made the ATLAS Provisions a bit more lucrative, they'd have their goals met easily. BoS C.A.M.P. items are cool and all, but most people I know don't WANT them. They want them (the BoS entirely) gone, or to be constantly nuked. As it stands, most of the high-level players I know with the junk to handle this (myself included), have said 'fuck no'. You want your community to go above and beyond? Reward them. Not with things they'll never use or build, but with things we want, need, or can truly benefit from.
---
No idea. I don’t think I’ve seen screenshots of items hacked with more than the usual 3 effects, which may mean they’re constrained by the current legendary implementation, but that’s purely anectdotal assumptions.
---
Damage can be rebalanced. You can buff other legendary bonuses. What CAN'T be tweaked right now is the exp gain advantage bloodied has over everything else. This creates a disincentive to ALL other builds which cannot be tweaked away.
---
Sounds like you met an average Fallout 76 player to me.
---
You are welcome sir.
---
Are we still participating in tbis event. Most people I have spomen to in game are boycotting this.
---
Haha, that’s awesome. Mine is Maniac Cop, I was able to get the facial scarring perfectly, and with the cop outfit and an axe, it’s glorious. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/CRDJE1L
---
Honestly, I half expect the BoS to nuke Atlas Observatory. We'll just see the plume from the distance as all that hard work goes up in smoke.
---
I'm not here to get into that quagmire, lol
---
Honestly haven't bothered with it the rewards are so shit and i don't even how im supposed to  claim the beret which i did donate to.
---
Appalachian Blackreach? I can see the future expansion potential. It actually works really well for incremental expansion- they don’t need to drop a whole huge finished world space at once, just a section of it, later expanded as more tunnels and caves get connected together.
---
I always hated the p.o.s (it's pronounced the same. Try it)  In fallout 4,I killed them all. Failed the quest line but it was worth it.
---
Now they're back and they want everything from us and right now???
---
You have 2 days to give us everything you have or else.
---
Sure thing bro.
---
The funniest moment for me was the time I decided to play with a random group that was already in the silo when I joined, my game was a bit laggy so I thought I'd head to the queen site in preparation and atleast put down my tent, I normally don't turn in game chat on but this time i made an exception.
---
Next thing I know a kid, most likely around 12 or so absolutely loses his shit, turns out that he was using a controller that was having issues with stick drift and in the process not only selected the wrong area to nuke but also managed to nuke the area near his camp.
---
I feel a bunch of Doctor Who TARDIS themed camps coming. 1x1 foundation with a door and inside is a huge bunker... 
---
But I'm not biased or anything.
---
Eh, the candy is a useful reasource, weightless food!
---
Strange, only thing I can think of is it might be the camera. I will check when I’m on which one I’ve got in case it’s different.
---
When you get to the overseers and go in, does the mission pop up at all?
---
I just started crafting my SS armor, and I have failed over dozen times at even getting the right prefix.
---
That is not bloodied, that's Unyielding.
---
I hope so!  Including an occasional Legendary!
---
Why would it bother you if someone could just easily place down a blueprint? They are still spending the materials. If you wanted it to be balanced for pvp make it so turrets cannot be blueprinted.
---
Do you play bloodied, it is a lot harder then running around full health with Vanguard gear and Junkies crap.   Should nerf Vanguard and Junkies, because no skill or real penalty.
---
Yup. Got me.
---
Bruh I don't even wanna nerf your damage. But surely you can see the exp difference is a more fundamentally damaging problem when the entire current endgame reward system revolves around exp?
---
There is no freaking way.  I donated 120k steel myself.  What the literal fudge guys?  I think the numbers are rigged.  Banner Today or Blood Tomorrow!
---
Edit:  It also doesn't help that the drops are worse than presents.
---
Next time build a bunch of flamethrower traps aiming in to that space, store the fusion generators, and then let him in...
---
Might teach him about being so demanding
---
If you do make and scrap, make sure you use science expert and that scout magazine. Makes energy weapons way easier to make, less resource intensive. (keep this in mind when tackling the Radium rifle)
---
Exactly, considering I work about 9 hours a day 5 days a week, it feels like all of this is just becoming a chore at this point. Of course I don’t have to participate but I want the rewards so I want to help out as much as possible. Same thing with The Legendary Run, at this point I’m just getting on to finish my dailies then get off.
---
How the hell are they going to build a bunker without concrete?
---
Maybe this is the incident that turns them into tribal-mocking technology hoarding isolationists?
---
Then again, they are the Brotherhood of Steel. Not the Brotherhood of Concrete. Brotherhood of Cork just sounds like the product of a drunken binge. Brotherhood of Plastic? They should keep this going with all of the junk items.
---
Brotherhood of Loose Screws. Brotherhood of Waste Acid?
---
Edit: If we have guilds in the future, dibs on Brotherhood of Concrete.
---
2 half wall, stacked. Flamethrower, full wall
---
Romancing allies is gross.  I don't want to be your Eskimo Brother.  How about procedurally generated companions so they are all unique?
---
Thanks ! No it did not, ive completed the wastelanders quest a few weeks ago and i have been to the overseer a few times, never popped up
---
How will bringing parity to exp gain (and tweaking exp rewards to compensate, see caveat in OP) take the fun out of the game for you?
---
I'm not saying nerf bloodied's damage or effectiveness or synergy. JUST the intelligence.
---
Raiders rep is the same quests, only the opposite choice for each. Vital Equipment - let the raider keep the item, Photo Opportunity - choose Foundation and give the photos to Kiyomi, Retirement Plan - kill the Former Raider  
---
You can also give raw mirelurk meat to Blackeye at Ohio River Adventures, and do the mirelurk defense for Fishbones if it's available (good source for the mirelurk meat).
---
Haha, no idea why we’re getting downvoted. To the bottom we go!
---
Really? Never had an issue with other players before, most I've met have been either helpful or polite.
---
Wait, there's a broken quest/event/daily?
---
We did it reddit, exploiters are no more!
---
We want underpants!
---
Very poorly would be my guess, unfortunately.
---
I gotta agree with the community on this one.
---
Group 1: Newer players don't have the scrap to donate.
---
Group 2: Veterans that don't have the scrap to donate.
---
Group 3: Veterans that have the scrap to donate, but split into different sub groups
---
1. People who are pissed about the latest patch and are protesting this event
---
2. People who have their regular routine and have no interest in the rewards for this event
---
3. People who are actually donating.
---
I'm putting my money on 3-3 not being the largest group and even if they went all out, concrete is such a limited resource, it's just bizarre to me that this was in the challenge to begin with
---
See comment below "bloodied gang will burn u alive"
---
It looks like they extended it to the 18th, like that will make any difference.
---
They're downvoting you as we speak so, proof of concept?
---
Lol, don't have plans or the required perks to build those yet, but thanks for the idea
---
uh, the weekly challenges change tomorrow, don't they?
---
One spawned right beside my camp when i logged in yesterday. My camp is at the opposite side of the top of the world ski place from the old raider town
---
The complaints valid. They could do better. They should do better. They probably won't do anything. We'll just have to see.
---
99% sure they'll give it to us anyways
---
Why would you think they would get rid of above ground camps?
---
https://imgur.com/a/wBnoZjB Here’s the screenshots.
---
Yeah, they explicitly said that the instanced interiors would be in addition to the normal camp. And that the instanced interior would be a completely different build budget as well. So you will end up with two build budgets, the exterior or the current setup, and the instanced budget.
---
Wow that's a really braindead response. Kudos man.
---
ALL of my characters are bloodied: bloodied unarmed/melee, bloodied pistols, bloodied commando, bloodied heavy guns.
---
They're all bloodied because without it they'd gain much less exp.
---
You can blueprint whatever you want, in modules.  So if you just have to drop a house with a white picket fence at every workshop, you can have that blueprinted and drop it easily.
---
But, I think forcing you into build mode IS part of the thrill, you can be attacked while building!
---
The Nuclear Winter are decent but I mean they could be better and I would recommend playing with people you know to have a higher chance of completing those challenges
---
There's a couple of bags in Hawks Refuge as well
---
I hope they won't do it with LR items.  I feel like that would be a real slap in the face for the players who put in the effort/paid atoms to unlock.   They probably will though.  Maybe with some texture change or something.
---
Bitch, I got walls to build.
---
Imagine if they released it for atoms after the community event failed.
---
My whole idea is that you have a preset build you don't need to manually place. It just places everything. Since it's a preset workshop you don't need to fiddle around, also any changes made can be changes applied to blueprint automatically.
---
Ah the little things in life, link playing with a keyboard and mouse.
---
Coolio
---
aw cmon, i was expecting a punchline when i opened this thread, not more questions!
---
50% legendary for a communty event is total lame. Should be 75%.
---
Thanks. Yeah - that's the brotherhood fatigues. Shown on row 48. It is supposed to be underarmor but is currently bugged for some reason.
---
Not really rare unfortunately. Couple of spawn points
---
I live in central Ontario and we've had one of the hottest summers on record. Record number of days with humidex readings over 40.  Been an odd year all around so far.
---
I read that France right now is actually drier than the Sahara desert...that's a nasty heat wave.
---
1 prime effect
---
1 secondary 
---
1 tertiary
---
So no bloodied / junkie even on hacked items to my knowledge.
---
Don’t lie your full health for life, too scrub not to be!
---
Sucks when all your weekly challenges are complete because you did them!!! 
---
Yes, they reset on Tuesday.
---
Try the double nuke method, land it right on the queen, then launch another nuke soon after directly on the previous nuke zone within a minute, people will think it's a glitch and go do the queen, then everyone dies
---
Aaah ok I can see that
---
Hey thanks! Ill give it a try
---
There is usually one egg on the roof of the second floor control booth at the monorail elevator. A little plastic alien toy is poised to eat it.
---
We will not fail. And if we do, who cares.... 
---
I already gave those schmucks 2,5k steel... And atleast that was easy and fun.  
---
I even wanted to make one full donation out of scrap collected from Brotherhood Corpses, but found out they rarely have anything on them ...
---

---
One of the guys I play with is like that.  Still, he isn't sitting on mountains of cork and concrete.  Regardless,  he isn't willing to part with what he has for the event given the poor compensation.
---
What's shitty about it?
---
It wasn't clear from the Q&amp;A whether other players will be able to enter your instanced interior which is my real concern... I mean, sure it would be cool but if I can't have other players/friends join me it loses a bit of its appeal
---
Personally I prefer my pvp to be on fair ground, like in Nuclear Winter.
---
That's exactly what I need to know, thank you!
---
I can go get screenshots, will that soothe you baby?
---
So.... 
---
I’m not sure what to say about this one other than “well played”, but last week someone dropped a nuke on Prime. I’m cheap, I wait for the public event to start for the free fast travel. Well, by the time I reacted, traveled, and finished loading, she was dead. Someone running a magic or hacked weapon I assume, but whatever, I’m not entitled, I didn’t launch the nuke, I have no claim here. Almost immediately after, Encryptid starts up. Interesting timing... quite a few people head over there. Fight starts up, it’s going about average for Encryptid, and the dude I suspect murdered the queen (pretty sure he had a hacked 50cal) was there, but just randomly spraying the bots every now and then. Then we get another nuke notification. 
---
2 minutes later we all die.
---
Afterwards I realize/am pretty sure that the murderbot dude set us all up. Nuked the queen to get us in that mode, immediately started Encryptid to get everyone there with lots of juicy Flux, toyed around to make the event seem engaging without ending it quickly, launched the other nuke on top of everyone who were busy fighting and probably expecting another Queen nuke, and then swept in to collect all the Flux and junk immediately after. I’m sure he wasn’t working alone, but it sure seems like some masterfully creative Raider action. 
---
Moral of the story? ALWAYS check the nuke target when you get the notification.
---
I’m not moving my camp fuck that
---
Hey let's keep posting again (and again and again).
---
I would hope they would test them extra carefully. Maybe push instanced camps back a few weeks. let them run on the pts and set players loose on trying to find any flaws. But more then likely they will release it in a rush. 
---
I personally won’t use them for a while. I have a feeling somehow it will be exploited for duping/ stealing from other players.
---
Oh man dont, I rocked up with my 250 hard fought scrapped steel, hit the dump.button and.......they wanted concrete....ffs! That would have been a strange find for someone in a steel locker at the train station 😂
---
When do we get the first Barret? Do we get them when this event ends?
---
switch off pacifist, take a bullet, kill the noob, take his loot, destroy his camp, this is sparta.
---
Go collect their shit for extra points
---
I dig when community events like this happen in games, but this one was certainly not thought out very well.  They can clearly see how many resources are gathered, scrapped, etc in any given length of time, what made them think we were going to go so hardcore to grind such rare resources for such lackluster rewards?
---
I'd dump double that to see beckett on a pole.
---
Huh? No it was a joke mate. I couldn’t care if some shitty banner/post is available. I made my donation to say I helped, but if we fail I don’t care. But it doesn’t mean I can’t joke or complain about it lol
---
9/10 times for me, it's that she's in the air 80% of the time. She'll land a handful of times, and that's when we do our damage.
---
Don’t need your photoshop pics to cover up the truth lol
---
I've heard conflicting reports. It seems some people can get it more than once, and some can't. I know I can't, at least.
---
Same. I am stealth bloodied commando and I run through and kill legendaries all the time without aggro and have never had this happen.
---
In all fairness they've done a great job to resurrect the game with watelanders and with them adding the bos to the game we know they have plans to make the game as great as we hoped. They need to add more content, make the game less lonely, add fuck tons of new unique quests and items like the old fallout games
---
You're talking about a game that has consistently nerfed danger and risk especially PvP on a nearly quarterly basis since launch.  Best thing you can hope for is they bring Survival back.  I think there was a petition.  That will be the PvP servers with danger and penalty (you used to lose Aid not just Junk) and Adventure will turn into PvE servers with more coddling.
---
And just another observation on this one. It is possible they changed it intentionally. We are not sure - the underarmor flag was removed. So it now works like regular clothing. Will see how this plays out
---
I knew the under armor is pretty common, but I heard the outfit isn’t. When I look it up online, i only find under armor. I’m gonna see if I can find a couple more to be sure. Thanks.
---
I'll literally build it for you on the promise you murder people with it
---
My guess is that the budget will hopefully be split but who knows if that will happen
---
they are still rare-ish like i have gotten many but that was like 40-50 server hops between each one
---
I think it’d be cool if whatever materials we are missing will show flaws in the overall construction and shape of Atlas.
---
Best bet? Try a bunch. I was in a similar situation right on the edge of a fissure, I didn’t fall all the way in so my junk bag was on a little cropping. I had SS jetpack, so I kept trying to dive in and get the bag from outside the death zone, and failing.
---
Until one time I didn’t die. I could run/swim/ fly around inside it with no damage at all. I’m sure if I left and tried to go back it’d kill me again, but it seemed like it’s an event horizon; crossing it kills you, but just being on the other side doesn’t, so if you manage to cross without dying? You’re fine.
---
I see OP walking his or her dog in the park and randomly screams out "We need to nerf bloodied builds"! lol, It's unbelievable the amount of nerf bloodied builds posts I see here, some bizarre. OP have you posted this numerous times in different ways?
---
Sounds good. Let me know. Check out the spawn points and make sure they are clothing rather than underarmor 👍
---
Agreed.  And it was never the technical folks at fault, but bad management.  They did not give them, and continue to withhold, resources to help this game realize its full potential.
---
Bold of you to assume people would tell them about dupe glitches found on the pts
---
Bethesda needs to never a flying boss ever
---
most dont sell on subs cause they have no value really now something like croc Backpack now that has value tell that gets super duped
---
No, and the whole thread is kind of meant to be a pun. I really just wanna nerf one thing on unyielding, not even bloodied.
---
It's pretty cool!
---
Do you also keep shooting her in the air or stay on tents?//Do the other participants?
---
Sorry but the whole point of the idea is to avoid the same tedious work of taking over a workshop for the 100th time. It's not fun to PVP in workshop zones, and it's not fun to be griefed by players who don't even need or want the workshop. 
---
I don't want to spend more time on workshops than i have to since they barely give you any gains at all if you are getting attacked by another player. PVP is not balanced or fun in this game for adventure mode, i am not going to justify keeping the same system to accommodate like 5% of players who spent months if not longer getting overpowered assassin's/sentinel set and just destroying me over and over again.
---
As it is workshops are somewhat of a painful experience.This suggestion not only promotes unique workshops for those who care to do it, but also to soften  other players griefing everything after you spent a bunch of time building everything up. With my idea all it does it make you waste materials instead of time as well.
---
Again, pvp specific events would dumpster your argument.  If I wanted to play Fortnight, or any battle royale for that matter I would.  I bought a Fallout game that promotes pvp and that's what I wanna do.  Y'all forget Bethesda made it this way.  But then you whine and whine til they nuke the part of the game WE enjoy to the ground.  I've been playing this game as long as most food builds have been alive so I don't like being told how it ought to be when it was intentionally made with this feature.  How can you even complain about it?
---
You can OS them with a stealth melee hit ;)
---
Just run off quickly because they explode.
---
Good lord this looks like an official location that'd be used as like a hub building or something for a fallout game. Just the way everything just fits on top of eachother is absolutely amazing!
---
Cheat your balls off
---
It’s the old question. If there is an event but there is not indication that the event is going on does it make a sound? 
---
This “ event “ was handled sooo poorly and so asinine that I almost feel like they wanted us to fail. This was nothing but a thing they could put on their roadmap to make it look like they actually had content going on. It’s bullshit of the highest order. 
---
Meat week that’s an event. Faschnact that’s an event. This was a community challenge that nobody cared about or even less knew about.
---
Yeah the flying already annoys me enough on normal scorch beasts to be honest, I branched out my build to rifles just for those.
---
maybe they didnt want to alienate people who fucking hate BoS with a burning passion...
---
If we just don’t give any cork then they can’t defend against us!
---
I was half expecting you to say he ran into a rad shower and lost the mutation almost immediately after taking the serum than asked you for another.
---
This is the best way you coulda put it lol. Quite the way with words you have.
---
I didn’t spend 700 atoms on a raider gas mask just to never raid anybody lmao. These people would cry if they tried playing Rust or Day Z or something.
---
Well you are deffffffinitely going to be banned “for making the game harder for him” 😑
---
1 of each free per person, had them for like 6 months.
---
It would take 50,000 FO1st members donating 3000 concrete each to reach 150 million, if they even have that much. That's a lot. And most people who have FO1st probably play the game a lot and have everything this event is offering. That's why we won't reach the goal, I was surprised we even reached the steel goal but it is significantly easier to get.
---
This comment is an EPIC FAIL 😂😁🙃🙈
---
...but workshops are PvP zones. "It's not fun to PvP in workshop zones" then gtfo
---
Beth screwed up the dates too...the steel collection went through 8/8 and I had no option to turn in any concrete. Concrete 'started' on 8/8 but again, no place to turn in until 8/9. So we're really dealing with three days total...no wonder there's less than 5m collected thus far...
---
Hell yeah man! Are you on right now? I've been trying to get them for awhile
---
You have never ran Charleston Capitol Building or Fort Defiance and killed ghouls before they completely got up off the ground? This also happens during Uranium Fever if you know where the Mole Miners spawn... as soon as they drop in, if you see a glowing one and fire before it starts running around. I can get this to happen at least once every run. 
---
Ill have to capture video since everyone thinks I am crazy and downvoting the piss out of my comments. I'd hate to be told from the fellow redditors that I "just need to be patient and let the enemies get up and move" but I have a feeling that's the recommended fix for this bug.
---
Haha they're so much they've made yet aren't giving out
---
Gorge Junkyard is a low level area which has a extractor location, then directly west of it is another concrete extractor location where I set up my camp. If you place your camp right you can extract and make purified water from the creek
---
Anything that leaves a fast travel spot out of the nuke but includes Fissure Prime AND Sundew Grove (chance for Colossus spawn) in the nuke is fine with me.
---
I believe Explosive Bait still seems to work.
---
Damn, you're nice. If they come at me with the annoying hitting me bit, I give em' nukashine and hope they drink it while I can still hear them freakout.
---
I am a dirty duper and I totally duped legendary modules. It took about..... 15k modules to roll all pieces with unyielding weapon weight reduction perks. Resources were in the hundreds of thousands for each material. 
---
Good luck guys. Sorry RNG sucks.
---
A lot of these sound cool but based on what’s in the game they would break the game or people would just camp farms to grab all resources
---
I miss that
---
All the dibs on "Brotherhood of Loose Screws". That's gold.
---
you are definitely reaching here...
---
guess how quickly they address this will be telling of how often their CMs check their community boards... I still am not clear if this is a bug or not.
---
You baited my click on the down vote button
---
EPIC FAIL 👐
---
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not so I apologise if this response isn't needed.
---
It is a Brotherhood Of Steel event. It is a Brotherhood Of Steel expansion. The entire theme of this event and the early part of next year is Brotherhood Of Steel.
---
I'm not sure how starving people of content related to the theme of the event and expansion is working to ensure that people that do not like the faction are not alienated.
---
They could find the dupers' stash without needing them to take anything from the scrap box. This is more likely something to get people to drain their own resources and encourage more gameplay to replenish said sources.
---
Yooo my feelings exactly haha.  Halo game chat would literally kill them 😅
---
If you stay too long in water, you’ll catch a disease. The game warns you about that.
---
Please explain how.
---
I'm not going to ask - and I certainly did partake...it's only caps, right?
---
I shoot her in the air to get my tag in.
---
After that, it's play with any adds in the area till she lands. Though if she's in the neverland area, I keep shooting.
---
why stop there? 76,000 Atoms!
---
Concrete is so hard to gather, they didn’t wanna give it to us in the first place
---
This...the rewards are crap...I can find most of that stuff just roaming around. Even the flagpole isn't worth it, so yeah, no grinding out concrete for a living...
---
I spent all day yesterday, scrapped up enough concrete to turn in the 250 and got some grenades and a bottle of beer. It was pretty disappointing. Definitely not a very rewarding turn in.
---
The NEW BOS Knights.
---
 We're Knights of the Brotherhood'O'Steel  
---
We dance when ever we feel  
---
We do routines and chorus scenes  
---
With footwork impeccable  
---
We dine well here in Appalachia  
---
We eat spam and jam and get bacteria  
---
We're Knights of the Brotherhood'O'Steel  
---
Our shows are formidable, But many times, we're given rhymes  
---
That are quite unsingable  
---
We're Opera mad in Appalachia  
---
We sing from the diaphragmia  
---
In war we're tough and able  
---
Quite indefatigable  
---
Between our quests we sequin vests  
---
And impersonate Clark Gable  
---
It's a busy life in Appalachia  
---
Now you must join our militia
---
On second thought let's not go there, 'tis a silly place.
---
You sure you brought it and it wasn’t bugged?  For awhile anyone could place the globe but it was eventually fixed.
---
Golf balls also at fairgrounds
---
They shouldn’t be encouraging people to AFK, causing server strain. No thanks.
---
Yes!  The boycott is working!  #brotherswhosteal
---
its a shame I do wanted the banner, its as a nice remember from the good old fallout games
---
That's great.  On the topic of lead, the Breach and Clear event, the Lucky Hole mine, and even the Whiteslring vendors (if you have caps on hand) to be solid supply of lead.
---
I stay on tents, yes. And yes I shoot her in the air.
---
You may be on a server or in a region where a Tesla fight is in progress.  As of the last patch they leave behind Chain markers which accumulate and bog down server performance.
---
If you're in Appalachia doing cheap Psycho that you stole from a scavenger already down on their luck, I have just the place for you. West Virginia’s hottest club is the Camden Stack Shack. Built on top of a dilapidated Red Rocket gas station, it has a familiar yet troubling feel, like when MODUS reads you a bedtime story. This place has everything: a bartender wearing sunglasses, beds in the shape of a race car, one single brahmin outside who refuses to leave. Plus, if you're feeling frisky, you can play everyone’s favorite party game, The Mysterious Stranger.
---
You’re not wrong but you’re also still wrong. Bonus XP is OP, ok?
---
So remove the Int and you remove the bonus do, right?
---
Well, no.
---
Because Bloodied builds kill everything faster. It’s your job to kill 10 robots? Blooded build does it 3x as fast (their damage is 5x as high, but they still have travel time). They also used way less ammo and took almost no durability damage to their weapons and armor, and didn’t need any chems, so they barely need to spend any time repair/replenishing.
---
So there’s a whole ‘nother level to what it means to have an XP bonus. Because killing enemies 3-5x as fast basically means a 3-5x XP bonus. 
---
When I’m sitting on top of the central pagoda during Path to Enlightenment, oneshotting every single ghoul that pops up, the 36% bonus XP doesn’t mean a whole lot compared to the massive kill speed I have. I dinged the 10k xp SCORE repeatable *3 times* last night doing that. Hell I can solo events like that that non-bloodied builds wouldn’t have time to down enemies fast enough before they pass and destroy the objectives.
---
Thanks so much! I definitely wanted something that felt immersive so that means a lot to hear!
---
They keep ignoring pvp in favor of this crap😰🔫
---
How the fuck is bloodied giving you bonus INT when you are getting it from Unyielding?
---
Nah I'll be on in about 3 hours though (I'm at work right now sorry)
---
Chuck me a message on Xbox; "Moist Coco Pops" is my GT
---
Don't see why ppl would be angry 
---
Majority didn't care to donate resources for the flag pole, thus it won't be given to everyone 
---
If it does pop up on atom shop, hey at least it's not permanently unavailable due to the failed event 
---
I don't see the problem
---
Yeah i understand that but what is waterborne disease what it is effect
---
It’s probably BoS themed considering one of the skins that were data mined showed BoS Armor with an Ace on it. And besides, it’s already almost Fall so I doubt beach stuff will be there.
---
Why? She gets less damage in the air and will be less likely to land especially if you use anything rapid fire.
---
You can see that just as he starts saying it he realized saying "fool me twice, shame on me" doesn't sound that good.
---
Same has been happening to me. It has also been throwing all my stuff in display cases back into the stash as well when this happens. I dunno if that's happening as well for you, but I thought I'd add that to the list.
---
BROTHERHOOD OF STEAL
---
happened to me once. also wiped out my displays
---
I got you man, I'm going to work in about a hour,  for about 7 hours, if you'll be on tonight. Il throw you a message now though!
---
A. Mazing. Reference!
---
Stumbled upon your comment. Just wanted to say that the rebuilding projects aren’t worth it at all. Bethesda put the requirements way too high. Right now I think it’s all about donating concrete, but the community is way far behind the goal, because of a nasty combination of factors. Also the individual rewards aren’t all that worth it, because you can get some plans, but they’re pretty rare drops, and not worth it because they’re not new, so if you’ve been playing for a while, you might just get a copy of a plan you already know.
---
Great, so you're wasting my time and everyone else's time arguing because they don't understand your pun or way of thinking. The only thing that needs a nerf here is you, sir...  Have a nice day :)
---
Well, I just HAVE to upvote this.
---
According to the Wiki, the only disease you can catch from being in water is Parasites, can't get online to test or confirm it.
---
The Marine Wetsuit Underarmour protects against any and all waterborne disease/s.
---
Seriously u/BethesdaGameStudios needs to see this!
---
Yeah but what is waterborne disease do? And where can i find wetsuit
---
Yup, just checked and did that too. Not even a game breaking glitch, just annoying.
---
Sounds like our routines don't really line up but I'll definitely get you one in the next few days dude.
---
Well wanting to get the tag in first is alright in my opinion, it's just people who constantly fire who make it hard for me to get mine in
---
Never used photo mode in the lobby. I will use this moment to get as many people to pose with me as possible!
---
You mean synths?
---
Do you ever see a glowing legendary ghoul laying down or do you wait for them to wake up and run toward you?
---
Pfft. 76 BILLION!
---
The problem explained:
---
* Bethesda creates an event with goals that are specifically unobtainable mathematically (as seen in other reddit posts). 
---
* Bethesda promises rewards for completing this event.
---
* The rewards are instead sold for real money on the micro-transaction store because Bethesda created a goal that isn't obtainable thereby stealing the chance of any player to actually earn the rewards promised for completing the event.
---
I am off work tomorrow, so il be on at some point tomorrow Durning the day. Hell yeah dude, thank you so much!
---
I hope I got your question right: It’s not the name of the disease. The diseases you catch from water are called “waterborne”.
---
It’s happened too much to me, absolutely no way I can reach the end of it. I’m just giving up on this game. They fix nothing, and delay everything, and break the game with quite literally every update.
---
Exactly - I dont horde concrete or cork like I do lead and adhesive. Even running around picking up every gnome and concrete bag I know of, I just can't farm more than a few hundred concrete in a few days. I haven't tried work shopping it, but I don't want to live at my workshop for concrete either. 
---
Compare to steel, where I turned in 6000 in about 3 hrs, not even trying hard. I just did uranium mine and cleaned the mole miners and areas around the white spring a couple times.
---
Yep, with scorched spawning at generator and I go OCD (pick up every single meat pile) it's around 2.5K steel with perk scrapper equipped. Had to cool it because of the carpal tunnel.
---
Exactly my concern, I rather have a limited budget than a instanced only camp
---
First of all, you're not saying anything that hasn't been said 100 times already. 
---
Secondly, you're using a threatening tone and claiming to speak for the entire community. 
---
Third: is this really a "community relations nightmare?" compared to all the other things that piss the community off on a daily basis?
---
been farming unyield/ WWR chest piece since the wastelander, still no drop yet.
---
Give him a break. Might be a Douchebag build
---
FO1st member, I only had something like 750 concrete in my scrap box, donated 500 of it, got crap from the supply box, not really going to even try to complete this, the numbers they're asking for are simply insane.
---
And cork? Who in the fuck ever collects cork? I go out of my way to AVOID collecting cork, I've had like 50 cork in my scrap box for months.
---
I'm getting enough flak for suggesting we tone down the exp gain from unyielding, if I suggest nerfing bloodied damage I'll be crucified.
---
Nope. If I had to guess, that might not be for a while. They haven’t mentioned anything about pets on the roadmap, so unless they’re planning to surprise us, it won’t be anytime soon.
---
Jeff Gardiner had a stroke on stream
---
Thanks:)) do you know where can i find  this armor
---
I really shouldn't have tried to make the title a pun because you're right, I really just wanna tweak unyielding.
---
I don’t blame Anyone for not grinding for concrete, the rewards are ass
---
the price
---
Ah I figured it out
---
they probably stumbled their way into a fix by breaking something else
---
I'll grab my .50cal Machine gun and rip em part with ya
---
Have had fallout first for about a year now and I usually pick everything up but some days I don’t being I am just grinding legendaries. But I checked the other day and I think I only had almost 1000 concrete. Cork I forget but it’s not a lot. Steel is easy. After five minutes I can have over 2k steel. But other shit, yeah not happening as quick.
---
Yeah he's definitely showing off how few brain cells the 76 community has by doing this
---
I have a set of stock power armor on me. I die often enough to random stuff or by getting stuck inside radioactive barrels but for the most part I'm fine. I have safe mode or w/e the anti pvp mode is called turned on so I don't fat finger a Gauss into a random being attacked by radroaches.
---
Ups 😅 i think i understand now. i thought it was a disease itself. Thanks :))
---
Ghouls in Charleston have the tendency to die for me and turn legendary if I kill them whilst stealthed and from a distance so I have had this happen a few times as well.
---
DayZ.
---
Cars fly, wolves fall through ceilings and bears can fit through tiny doors.
---
And that's just the fun things...
---
Sounds about right.
---
Grenades, lots of em. That’s how I solved some of these problems. Otherwise sneak and it’s survival so sometimes running away is an option.
---
Yeah i said fuck it...im rolling a full Heavy combat with ap refresh +wwr...cant even imagine how long it would take to roll that
---
It’s to get rid of duped mats
---
Just a question for you. Are you gonna kill the BOS before or after killing every one in vault 13 and trying to poison every men woman and child in the capital wasteland?
---
They're just gonna refaction it, giving the brotherhood of steel more steel i understand, that makes sense, I'm getting worried the banners are gonna be brotherhood of cork or brotherhood of concrete or god forbid the brotherhood of plastic
---
Yeah. Everything except 3 deathclaw hands I think. If I die and lose all my junk I'll just stop playing *shrug*. Until then I finally have a reasonable weight solution that lets me hoard junk and still keep the cool guns.
---
Otherwise I just go back and pick it up if I do die.
---
My game is ruined, I can't raise the BoS flag over my camp.  Lawsuits!  Or something.  Smeeeh.
---
Some are marked SCORE_, but Bethesda has never strictly followed their internal naming
---
Between my porn addiction, computer game addiction and alcohol addiction, a big dick will only keep them around for a limited time. The good news is it makes it easy to find replacements, regardless what your GF tells you about yours.
---
its cool as long as no one is using a plasma or tesla. The piles get stuck under the ash or goo piles.
---
Nice ferris reference
---
I donated 250 steel then didn’t bother, saw concrete and cork and I don’t think I even have enough to make one donation on either of my characters, absolutely absurd amount and whoever came up with it needs a slap 😂
---
Because I don't do as much damage as other players, and there's a minimum damage threshold I have to pass to get loot/XP. Every hit counts. And I haven't seen consistent results to say that hitting her in the air affects her landing. I've seen no one hit her and she never lands. I've seen 5 players hit her constantly with rapid fire and she lands 8 times.
---
They could balance it lol. Maybe increase build costs of certain items?
---
I don't think they are trying to build a dam...
---
They are trying to build a giant concrete statue of Todd Howard!
---
Mirelurk Kings, Assaultrons, and Robo-brain's with the Mesmatron helmet. Enemies with infinite crippling attacks or infinite power charge should have been the first thing fixed.
---
I shoot her with a semi handmade till I feel that I got enough damage in then I'll alternate between using a cryolator on her when she lands and my handmade on adds when she takes off again.
---
Uhh no that's Super Soldier Serums. All perfectly fine like good ol' Frank Horrigan. No muties round here you filthy mutie.
---
Haha fair enough, I got massively downvoted for explaining to people why the handmade drum mag has the “correct” capacity. Nobody cares about balance, they just want to be OP.
---
This is super insightful, thank you so much!
---
I have a feeling concrete and cork might not reach their goals, wood and cloth I have feel won't be a problem.
---
It's like watching radiation mutate a pile of garbage into a garbage monster. Sure, it looks a bit cool, but it's garbage.
---
I read a long while ago he stumbled on it because he didn’t want a sound bite of him saying ‘shame on me’ out there for people to use.
---
I’ll keep my concrete to make razor grain flower thank you
---
There's a few spawn points for the Plan: Harpers Ferry, the train wreck west of Watoga along the tracks, the trainyard even further west of Watoga along the tracks, and one of the Drop Sites nearby.
---
They also have a chance at spawning BoS underarmour, Marine Armour and Robot Armour plans.
---
Never forget Navarro
---
You ARE getting crucified. 😂
---
I hope so. Maybe we can get our steel back.
---
Nah, the guy at ATLAS just wants to get supplies for them, they never asked him to get them. They don't even know he exists right now.
---
Well only reason I believe it is because as a melee build walking around right below her all the time you can see the stagger animation as she is shot interrupting her landing one but I guess that's fair, though I don't know what kind of damage you do I'd think you could just get the damage in then stop, or just start shooting when she lands altogether as you'll do more damage then
---
Happened to a friend right after patch 21. Very annoying since she had 4 vendors full of stuff.
---
That would be awesome. Then if we dont hit the rest of the goals they just put that Dorsey dude in cell for wasting their time
---
Enforcer shotgun and cripple their head, works for me
---
I’m 17 levels behind.
---
They will still come, we just won’t have a fancy banner to welcome them with
---
that's a very nice way of doing it, keep it up!
---
It's already done.  Im also proficient in radium rifles.  It just cost a lot.  Theres only 1 mod I dont know for ultracite gatling lasers and it's a charging barrel so naw.
---
May your travels be filled with good fortune and plentiful stims.
---
Line of sight them so you can avoid the laser beam.
---
If you have Game Pass, it's definitely worth a shot. I'm enjoying it much more than I thought I would.
---
Sorta- Rick who is the design director was in both. Yesterday's was with Jeff, the Project Leader and this one was with Ferret who does all the storylines and such
---
Because of how database records work. Steel is just one thing - steel. The amount of steel you have is one number.
---
A weapon is many entries. Off the top of my head - Name, type, level, barrel, sight, receiver, stock, grip, star level, perks, paint.
---
Now compound that by each existing character that's been created by each player that has ever played the game.
---
Now- figure out a way to keep all that data responsive, so it takes no longer than a second for anyone who opens their stash for the server to query the database of millions of records, retrieve that player's stash records, and send it to that player's client to display on their PC.
---
It was previously bugged, allowing people who didn’t buy it to place it. If you didn’t buy it, you can no longer place it.
---
That's some big brain strats right there
---
The problem is my main and alt have pets and I don't wanna risk losing them lol
---
Guess I'll have to make another alt for location scouting
---
I've just been in 2 back to back Queen fights, where somebody just melted her both times without her landing. Most of the time in public fights I get loot, because of Bloodied Gauss shottie with bash dmg and magic armor part. Put myself in 3rd view, fire away couple of times and its enough tagged dmg for loot. Then I concentrate on summons, often saving others, while they are occupied with hitting the Queen themselves. This time it wasn't enough, she was dead in seconds, and I'm having hard time believing anyone got any loot, except that one guy. Incredibly selfish, and pointless.
---
It's easy...all the really really cool stuff will be in the atom store, all the really \*meh\* stuff is guaranteed for the next season legendary run.
---
Plus, honestly, it's a waste of power on the user's end too.  Assuming a 300 watt draw on the computer and power at 10 cents per KwH, 7600 hours is $228.  That's not even getting into thermal and mechanical (fans) wear and tear.
---
If you’re all in for strength, you could invest in a decent Gatling gun with heavy weapons perks. You can craft so much ammo for it for cheap, it won’t burn through the ammo all at once and it’s just really reliable in general.
---
Wow food builds and 12 year olds are trying to nuke us down are we gonna take this in stride, consenting adults?  They don't bitch in Doom.  They don't bitch in Elder Scrolls.  We can't let them ruin Fallout with their care bear bs, this game is not a political statement!
---
Omg that would be so dope to have a Gutsy guard instead of a collectron haha
---
You mean you don't want the grand prize of more meat weeks?
---
Green Thumb and Butchers Bounty have never worked at PP, so I guess you don't know how it's supposed to be ran either
---
Yeah, yeah.. the usua-- wait... Did you say HOME saw?
---
Supply and demand, my friend.
---
in the playtest video the devs (all bloodied) seemed perfectly happy dying by Earl and respawning or getting stimpacked.
---
This, alot of people seem to be forgetting the Brotherhood has no clue this is going on.
---
You can obtain roughly 300 concrete from item spawns per map, per server, assuming no one else has taken the items. Obtaining 200 million of this is quite clearly almost impossible unless everyone specifically leaves the server all at once to trigger respawns whilst specifically farming every workshop for concrete. This in tandem with the poor event rewards = no one participating.
---
There is no way mathematically that it is possible to complete that concrete goal. The only way to obtain it at this point, so close to the end of the goal, is to duplicate or to falsify the numbers.
---
The goal of a community event like this is specifically to give obtainable rewards in order to generate interest in the related expansion.  If you fail to do that then the even has failed. The goal is community engagement, and it is not working in this case.
---
I think you can get perk packs for taking enough lobby pictures. Check you challenges
---
0/20/40/60
---
ummm? you're the reason this game doesn't have sexy sleepware. lol
---
Yeah very pointless indeed, I just hope he was the guy who launched the nuke because if not, poor them. I don't think I've seen her melted in the air yet so that's pretty intriguing too
---
I suspect this event was an attempted database cleanse. They were hoping to reduce the amount in the 1st users infinite scrap boxes.
---
I swear it’s getting worse as time goes on. I had a 95% hit chance on a sentry bot yesterday, used a crit and it somehow fucking missed
---
I think this is confirmation that we'll finally be able to repair and use all those tanks scattered around the wasteland...it's the only reasonable answer right?
---
I mean I'm happy for them. I just wish they'd tweak exp gain since their entire endgame meta revolves around exp gain.
---
200 hours later I still have yet to get the responders fire helmet....
---
PVP is broken and unbalanced. We shouldn't throw away a good idea to accommodate someone who likes to attack people while they are building.
---
My idea doesn't even stop you from pvping the person. Nor is it broken or unbalanced, esp if you don't allow the blue prints of traps or turrets. I am not interested in the broke and unbalanced PVP and i still need the materials from workshops.
---
Most of the time i don't even get attacked because most players understand what a pain in the ass it is to lose all progress for scrap for ammo you want to craft becuase some asshole comes and griefs your workshop they don't even want or need.
---
Current workshop design is painful. Especially when there is no limits on how many times they can just attack you after you successfully kill them. Caps are easy to get, there isn't enough punishment, you can just keep harassing someone, it's not fun at all. Then you leave the workshop and they don't even take it over.
---
Don't much care to accommodate a very small amount of people who see workshops as "PVP zones" when it's the thing i do the least in a workshop. I am not going to stop using workshops because assholes with overpowered PVP armor exist, i just find a new server and hope they don't follow me there like they done in the past.
---
If pvp armor didn't exist, i think PVP itself would be a lot more balanced. Too much of a time sink for me to want to be good at for a situation that rarely happens that i can just fix by switching servers because i need  scrap.
---
As well you should, it works!
---
In all fairness they did a great job since beta. I was around in the beta days and first launch. It's way better now in terms of fun and content.
---
Imagine dual wielding two Bloodied explosive automatic laser pistols
---
\*visualizes Gramps pole dancing at CAMP\*
---
🤔
---
Correct. And now I'm paying for trying to make the title a pun.
---
7600 billion, everyday, just for the loging in.
---
That sounds armist.
---
Good for him. He’d be disappointed in the game in its current state.
---
Whoever has been working with the emotes needs to go back on unemployment. They've removed several emotes
---
How was that even a thing lol 😂
---
Ty for doing that. Great job
---
Heck yeah! Like I'll go get my own scrap, you just stay here and annihilate everything 🤣
---
I hope they fix it so everyone spawns at the same time. It would also be nice if NW special is separate from adventure special, since what is optimal for adventure isn’t optimal for NW. It’s ridiculous to have to change your special distribution or level up a new character for NW.
---
Yeah, I only keep about 50-75 concrete in my stash. I grabbed some gnomes and even found the bridge stash of concrete once, but the rest I went to were empty.
---
I had the whole ass quest break and refuse to progress after walkway sections. Had to go the settler route because of it.
---
I got a bolstering one and said fuck it I’m done lol
---
Sneak all times. 2.5 times sneak or whatever those perks are help. Only way I'll tango with them as I'm mostly a stealth sneak player. Love sniping long distance or sneaking up melee. Very fun.
---
This is where I encounter this the most. Glad I am not the only one this happens to. What do you do to get around this? Kill at melee distance?
---
It is brutal. You could keep creating new characters and doing the final departure quest for better odds?
---
Which is odd, considering they can tell exactly how much of each scrap type all players have.
---
Took me over 120 to get a 3 star unyielding chest... was fun
---
I'm not bloodied and tbh getting the XP for SCORE is not really a problem.  So I see your point but don't think it really matters much.
---
If anything, remember to get a hit on a legendary enemy and make sure others around also were able to shoot them. That way everyone can get a legendary item.
---
My friend is missing this, both the raider and survivor tents the normal wave emote and we cant see eachother in the social menu I've never really had any bad bugs like that but he is constantly hitting stuff like that.
---
I'm basically Jangles, so can you explain that in monkey brain terms?
---
“EX-TERM-I-NATE! EX-TERM-I-NATE! EX-TERM-I-NATE! EX-TERM-I-NATE THE SCORCHED!”
---
Honestly when i saw this in advance I was just like haha ok good luck on the concrete and cork, there's no easy farm method ... steel be super easy I dumped 5k in just cos but I only had 500 concrete and I wanted to keep some so .. 250 because hey just incase someone has 145 million concrete stashed away xD
---
It will be the Atom Cats coming to Appalachia and bringing legendary power armor with them!  Anything else and we will be disappointed, lol.
---
I have only seen her taken out quick one time.  Most times I go to that event it takes a little while and she lands often enough.  I am currently running a shotgun build so unless she is right on top of me I don't waste the ammo while she is in the air.  When she lands it's me and the melee (if they are there) guys ruining up to tag in.  When she takes off again I focus on anything that spawned after she landed.
---
I sat on a server for over 2 hours and only got 1 public event.  It may be a tin foil hat theory but I think the slowed the public events to keep the grind going for the t-notes.  :-)
---
It seems to mainly happen with the ones on the floor so I let them stand up first before killing them, seems to help out.
---
Yeah that’s been there for at least a month.
---
GO HOME BROTHERHOOD OF STEAL.
---
GO PLAY LARP SOMEWHERE ELSE NERDS
---
Who said people are refusing to donate? Concrete  only spawns in certain places. I have been checking them today and they have all been picked clean.  It's not that I refuse to donate.   I have nothing to donate because the concrete is all gone.
---
Yeap, there’s lots of visual/texture mods mods and be sure to get the perk load out one! It’s an awesome QoL !  Check the nexus mods for them. Also I need to mention modding will prevent u from playing Nuclear Winter mode, there is a workaround about it, but since idc for the game mode I don’t mind that.
---
Edit: thanks for the award :D!
---
Right now I'm just being bombarded by a lot of weeping FOTM builds who don't really know, or care, about how the game works. I welcome their chapped baby-bottom cries.
---
Wish I had a faster gun than a sniper rifle. :P
---
Figures, the guy I need gold the most on is my poorest.

You can catch a disease while swimming, that's all. Particularly you could catch Parasites which give you periodic food loss for about 15 min.

You read the unencrypted broadcasts, well done.
---
Right because not knowing whether a perk card works for an event I've only been able to run through twice means I have no idea that you're supposed to split up with other players to ensure the three troughs get filled so you can get a friendly that can survive while you protect them from the waves and eventually a legendary cryptid. Solid deductive reasoning there, friend.
---
y tho
---
They need to lower the amount of concrete you can donate at one time also. Like 10 bundles.
---
You mean a tomahawk plan isn't a proper reward from a group of people who hoard advanced technology?
---
or anyone else... it's not based on participation
---
Here's how you do it: quit the raider shit, do the settlers questline, get the Chinese stealth suit, then sneak past those cunts
---
I have spoken to people on 2 fallout 76 discords, and have also spoken to private friends (roughly 8 people). If you look at the other reddit posts discussing this event you will also see people specifically saying they are not donating because they don't like the faction, don't like the rewards being offered, or do not want to engage because it looks unobtainable.
---
My bloodied was a 1* also and I think I only rolled 2 other 1* out of 40 tries, huh.
---
You know, for when you need to do saw stuff at home......like.....a limb?
---
I put some in so it’s not my fault
---
I have found that if people don't do l/fail them, they occur less frequently. Then if you do complete them, they happen around every 15 mins and so on. 
---
I think due to new xp exploits that you can do it which allows you to just kill endless enemies that events no longer even compare. Thus as public events don't get done they happens very slowly. 
---
I am only speaking from my experience however.
---
I took 5 stims, 2 addictols, and 2 disease cures just in case anything was hiding and the issue is still there. Popped over to Morgantown Airport and capped the scorched there (lvl 6-8) and I was still getting extremely low damage per shot. No idea what is going on at this point. Thanks for trying, though!
---
TIL I'm a synth.
---
Yeah this particular challenge sucked and was a total mistake I agree with you lol
---
The other challenges and rewards look alright tho, so I don't see the reason to care about the loss of this camp flag pole item enough to write off the entire challenge event
---
It’s been super duped lol
---
I won’t bother with finding a pet until I can get a dog, that can’t be killed. Until that day comes I just make a pilgrimage to the good dog that hangs out across the river from harpers ferry and periodically drop off some dog food for it.
---
well i have magic weapon but i wait everyone to shoot her. when she land i dopr her hp to like 35% and stop shooting and still wait for everyone to finish her. if they cant i finish her. not allmagic weapon users are bad. i guess it depends on the person
---
And I will whisper... No
---
Also to the old ones lol I was wondering why my carry weight was so much for days now and then I went to craft some ammo and saw I was holding like 2k gunpowder almost lol
---
My eyes hurt. It's magnificent!
---
∆ I said fallout 1st
---
The goal wasn't the problem... I wouldn't mind grinding the shit out of the game for concrete or other things for scrip. Even just a few scrip per turn in would have made it worth the time for me.
---
Or mabye worthwhile rewards?
---
Scenario #1. Shoot for a while, get bored, leave. Bleh.
---
Energy weapons are not allowed to have bloodied i thought, they took them out of the game.Most other weapons in game are not being use like players. This will expand your options.
---
Sadly it would make no difference if there was a pile of concrete bags on ever street corner, people would rather moan and sit on their asses waiting for some mythical auto-complete. I shall offload my last concrete and call it day for the whole event.
---
That's legit some Gacha level tier crap. Hell even worse at times.
---
I recommend grabbing 50 cal and shot her as soon as you can it should allow you to do required damage in about one minute without changing your build, you will get loot and you will be happy 😃
---
Check your toothpaste to be sure, if caps off its all over for you.
---
Better question would be why is there so much destruction when no bombs fell in Appalachia?  I can kinda see ghouls having wandered in from elsewhere I guess, but everyone in Appalachia basically died to a zombie apocalypse thanks to the Enclave with the scorched, not nuclear war.
---
For the sake of Caps, I feel folks for the most part will use it for good. 
---
Can't always make QOL decisions based on those who are going to abuse it, we'd never get any implementations that way.
---
Lol, imagine if they take his crap and he's later found loving in some shack a ways from the observatory.
---
Explosive Energy weapons were taken out of the loot pool over a year ago, but you can still trade them, so you can still get your hands on one today through the market
---
Most likely will be like with the raiders and settlers where you can only kill the ones from random encounters so that you don't just kill them all and as a result no would could do quests
---
Depends on what weapons you use, some can chew through bullets really quickly. LMG and .50 cal don't take long to burn through 2-3k ammo, especially if you're doing Scorched Earth and don't want to use any fancy ultracite ammo. Then when I get home that 200-300 gunpowder I have laying around is gone and I have to use cloth to make more.
---
I literally know of people that have played with Pete Hines and he was a good sport about getting nuked.
---
I like this!
---
Cork is another resource that is not often stockpiled by players. It's also unlikely to be donated in the asked quantities due to the poor rewards.
---
I'm hoping that Bethesda simply admits they screwed up the estimates and either alters the dates and quantities needed or just point-blank gives out the failed rewards. It would be much nicer to have them actually talk to us.
---
3. Team with dedicated SBQ platform. Runs all 3 silos simultaneously and then launch/kill, launch/kill, launch/kill  within minutes of each other, and then leaves server
---
Boom!
---
Love it!
---
Could have something there actually. I wanted to make a lab, with some high tech doctor who stuff in there, neon lights and conical flasks etc
---
Yeah, the problem with the Flying is it doesn't actually do anything to make the fight more difficult. It just makes the fight longer. The poison cloud mechanic can be implemented with a ground based attack. The Sonic screech does negligible damage if you are running fireproof. If they insist on keeping these things in the air, at least have them to some sort of dive bomb attack on players.
---
76 googl
---
Do you know if this was fixed? I am trying to place it now and other than not being able to see where im trying to place it it wont go in either.
---
Cork and Cement will be a no-go because of how relatively hard they are to get (cork is uncommon, and concrete weights a shit ton). Now look at the rewards lined up for each turn in. BOS collectron for *cloth*? Obviously Bethesda wants that to go out. SCORE weekend for cork? I am guessing they don't care.
---
It's insane this isn't a feature at launch its clearly needed. Shame two years later we still don't have it. Like that's a first patch type thing
---
big if true
---
I didn't mean to offend, of course not all magic users are bad, it's just that those who melt her stand out a lot
---
Thanks for the links, these are really useful!
---
They seemed to be hinting at lifting a lot of the building restrictions in order to cut back on some of the glitches with camps so I definitely think we will have both our camp and a shelter/playerhome we can probably get with caps (hopefully) or atoms
---
&gt; conical flasks
---
Or even a maze with the bunker hidden in the maze, which leads to maze 2, where the vendors are hidden :D
---
Why are you making a big post about it if you've only ran it twice? Thanks for confirming my assumption?
---
Also, just to expand on this, many areas are level-capped. You will never see a level 60 ghoul within relative proximity of Vault 76, just the max-level enemy for that area.
---
It’s supposed to come out in the winter dlc update. It’s been on wishlists for a loooong time haha
---
I don't constantly shoot her, but when she's hovering directly over me, I fire.
---
This right here. No way in hell am I giving up my scrap for some crappy grenades, stimpaks and alcohol. 
---
Maybe I would if there were more plans. 
---
Maybe if there were legendaries. 
---
Maybe a hundred different things they could have done differently to make this a good event.
---
If Bethesda must set real goals then the player base must make a real effort. Its been a long list of excuses not to participate.
---
I don’t see any way we are completing anything besides the steel one.  :(
---
Yeah, each turn in should give 76 legacy weapons.
---
In reference to #2, Large Black Powder Bayonet mod can be learned by scrapping the mod box, after that you can attach to BP rifles, but it will not attach to The Dragon anymore.
---
Compared to the amount of steel we donated, we could’ve achieved it. No one felt the need to grind though, as others have said.
---
Yeah steel was super easy to farm but concrete? Fat chance.
---
Or mabye not stuff most of the player base got 8 months ago.  But I mean if you want legacies shoot for the moon am I right?
---
I think he means "feminists" and "objectify". I'm equal rights - give the ladies some Brad Pitt's or whatever,
---
If I could choose freely I'd want to use ballistic automatic rifles and explosives, while modding guns and equipping better gear as I find it. But from my earlier experience automatic rifles are basically just annoying since they eat up ammo. Rifles might be nice to but they seem to require you to stealth around to be able to handle things in late game.
---
Getting a lot of flash backs from a lot of game communities reading this.
---
I didn't have to.
---
Honestly, what do people expect ? It's a multiplayer game, of course they can only allow limited mods. The fact they allow any mods at all is frankly surprising.
---
What about adding supermutant raids on atlas as an event?? Sort of like meat week and faschnacht events. This time we protect those builder bots. Those are my favorite special events
---
I’ll be interested to se did the dialogue or anything changes. What if the fanboy doesn’t get into the BoS because we failed to many missions and they figured he was useless?
---
I am literally trying to get us our own space away from food builds and they downvote this?!  Did you even read it or just see pvp and break your damn finger?  I'm trying to get you what you all want!
---
https://map76.com/
---
Is a good map also. Really good for finding lesser known spots for stuff.
---
You are probably right, but I usually find it prudent to never underestimate the human capacity for dickery. As a result, they should still take care to prevent some of the more obvious methods of abuse if they ever implement this kind of thing.
---
I have a legacy gatling plasma, but you have to check your sarcasm detector.
---
They are not even technocrats. They are tech preservers. Their attitudes towards non-humans and synths is totally understandable within the context of the universe itself and absolutely does not make them fascists. They do not govern, they collect and preserve.   
---
In post-apocalyptic lore they are the remnants of an unchanged humanity, much like the power-armor wearing pure strain humans of Gamma World. If you think the BoS are fascist you should probably take a hard look at the franchise and examine how the Enclave feels about people in the wasteland.   
---
If you were living in a world where synths were replacing people and being controlled from some mysterious high-tech underground wizards tower you would probably hold them in a negative light as well.
---
What they said, plus the flame thrower trap would be faster regardless. Using this glitch definitely helps the camp game! Been doing it for a while and it definitely makes camps better
---
Really no understanding of multiplayer games is there from you OP?
---
I'm glad we think alike when a post-apocalyptic world happens.
---
I mean ill donate you 500 cement and 1k cork for it?
---
I like to display a box of shooting targets that I think is glitched or something as it’s usually a quest item only, and an empty mole miner pail from the treasure hunter event. I also like the super mutant head from the place radiation rumble takes place in, I’m not sure if it still spawns after radiation rumble started happening there as they changed it around a lot. There’s the jarred scorched head in Morgantown Airport. I also like displaying some of the instruments you can find about like violins and drums and stuff. You can find those in tall houses in the ash heap.
---
Wait? Stimpaks help? And here I was thinking healing items would only make the game more difficult :/
---
I don't think I've ever seen Morgantown nuked.  Gonna have to do that soon, I'm always low on stabilizing components (High Radiation Fluids especially).
---
Because I've tried running it dozens of times and, as stated in my post, people either don't show up for it or dip out before the actual event even begins, and because I've seen people talk about the event and mention the same problems I'd brought up. The fact that no one is doing it seemed to me like evidence that there must be something preventing people from wanting to do it, and through my experiences and others that I've heard, that something seems to be the fact that, for good rewards, the event requires you to have all three troughs full and their friendlies protected and no one is willing to do that.
---
I'm literally just repeating myself here. It's like you saw the title and jumped straight to the comment bar.
---
Anything other than a Bloodied I wouldn't keep if it rolls as a 1* but hey, mine rocks everything I aim it at.  Maybe I will get bored and have to try and roll something with more stars but I would like to get a good set of SS Unyielding armor to replace my old set.
---
Yes :D
---
[https://youtu.be/wDYNVH0U3cs](https://youtu.be/wDYNVH0U3cs)  I can't raise the flag.  NOOOOOOOOO!
---
Nah, try the Brotherhood with that.
---
XP exploits?  Hrmmm. New to me. :(
---
I'm imagining/hoping for a "door" that we can place in our camp. Either an actual front door or a hatch/bunker/hobbit type deal. When you place it, you now have an instanced interior behind that door. If it's above ground, force the interior to fit within the wall space built. 
---
I'm hoping underground they would allow us to customize the space to a degree. Build max 10x10x10 or whatever. 10 floors wide, long, and deep. So I can build a 1x1x2 bunker just for me or utilize the whole space for a mini-vault. 
---
I really loved Home Plate from FO4 so hoping it's reminiscent of that/gives the ability to build something similar. Also hoping to build my own bunker. 
---
Maybe they'll give us a small building to place. like the bunkers in the Mire.
---
A trick to keeping them in the vendors is blueprint them. Someone told me that when someone is shopping at your vendors and you log out it resets your vendors. I tried and it happened then I blueprinted then and tried again and they stayed in. Just a little tip so you don't have to keep stocking them up
---
You can fast travel??
---
That would be pretty awesome. Maybe add a new section every week or two as more of it gets dug out or something. Doesn't have to be a huge addition every week either. People will come check out what has been uncovered.
---
Three enemies in F76 in particular that are a pain in my side:
---
1.) Assaultrons - head laser seems to have a considerably shorter charge time than in Fallout 4, and it is pin point accurate. Without Power Armor or increased Energy Resistance I get shredded by it badly.
---
2.) Mirelurk Kings - smaller and considerably more tanky than in Fallout 4. Their sonic attacks are deadly too if they can hit you in the head.
---
3.) Colonel Gutsy - not sure why Bethesda decided to make the high level Mr. Gutsys more powerful out of all the robots, but Colonel Gutsys get both high armor/resistances and their two shot armor piercing guns. It's brutal how fast they can punch through players when there is nothing discerning about them typically.
---
I like the souvenir cow magnet. Too bad I can’t attach it to my refrigerator.
---
Just wait until the BOS shows up with a new set of armor that is slightly better than secret service....
---
well if they would get off the tents she would land
---
Nothing we can do will stagger the queen that is a glitch from not being able to aquire a target
---
We can't stagger or cripple her period.
---
Also, group all your vending machines together!  I'm not going to hunt around your entire camp for 4 machines spread across multiple floors or rooms.
---
FO76 bags of concrete are 5 pounds, not 80.  I already did the math, lol.
---
The free globe with the bombs only works for the character you unlocked it with. The globe lamp should be in the lights section
---
Sorry being tricked into giving my shit to the biggest hoard of raiders for a box of trinkets isnt my thing.
---
it's true that you can overexplain any joke
---
I've got a Bloodied 33% VATS hit chance and 25% less AP cost, its one of my fav weapons, just have to remember to fully charge then enter VATS, not the other way around, and its alot of fun
---
There’s a memory-eaze mug up in... the whitesprings lookout I believe? My friend found it up there.
---
it is still a shitty smart move, my friend. take care
---
Much better than yesterday's rng dependant bullshit. Need to find a stimpack before you run into the fire, good luck with that!
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw91RJ\_m\_7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw91RJ_m_7g)
---
I just dont see them working on something and then make it locked for anyone forever with no way to obtain it, just because Playet didnt get *MILLIONS* for Junk.
---
Rather than see the work go to waste they would make the most out of the thing they already are done with.
---
But it's also not the Brotherhood who is rewarding us right now either, it's a brotherhood wannabee.
---
I think you’ll find that if the reddit community hates something, no one else playing gives a hoot. Everyone on here also boycotted steel, quit the game, and claimed the game was going to die a year ago. 
---
More people than not just don’t want to hop around for rss. It’s a minority that directly opposed to the event or Bethesda outside our usual frustrations with unchecked bugs
---
Can't even kill the damn raiders.
---
Y'all wanted your stupid NPCs.  Well now we got 'em and we can't get rid of 'em.
---
Concrete just isn't farmable
---
I bought it in a bundle because it was dope, then they removed my ability to place it i believe
---
Exactly. This sorry excuse for an event and an actual event that was delayed was what they advertised for this patch. So in other words this patch had absolutely nothing, no new content, meaningful bug fixes, nothing. What a joke to all of us dedicated players.
---
I'd just like the chance to buy that emote again. I remember promising myself to buy it when it was seperate when the Grognak bundle first dropped...left it until the last day and had to go do something IRL and never made it back to the house in time.
---
Sorry to hear people having problems with emotes. I'd like to see a chance to buy the rare ones more often.
---
I have a collection of Gnomes that will be dropped in the local river now the event has gone to hell.
---
Been straight up pissing me off too
---
You can, but it's more fun to dance into the fire [https://youtu.be/Fp4CR2HcHLQ](https://youtu.be/Fp4CR2HcHLQ)
---
Adhesive's easy enough to get hold of, just grow some corn, mutfruit, and tatos near your water purifiers and then turn it into vegetable starch.
---
I worry a lot of people think this is the BoS expansion.
---
You don't need stealth to get by. Only to deal larger amount of damage.
---
I’d say the goal was part of the problem - concrete is much harder to farm than steel ... and there is not a lot of reason for people to store it either ... it’s a bummer as this is the one item from he rewards that I was actually interested in ...
---
Cork laser rifle, cork power armor, cork fortifications.
---
I don't think I've ever seen that, I'll be sure to be on the lookout!
---
Edit: pun unintended, but I wish it was.
---
Go to lost home instead
---

---
well you could do it like that and know your prefix or the old way and maybe take 2 months or more to get your piece,plus this is an MMO, there is grind in all of them. If everything was easy to get people would all get the meta gear right away, get bored quick and leave. I think they are aiming for at least 10 years.
---
Just what i thought. I have this badass legacy quad exploding harpoon launcher that makes it own ammo on enemies. Shoots four exploding harpoons, and it has quad ammo capacity.
---
Either way they can balance it so the second weapon has a associated costs like extra ammo usage or lower damage output effects on legendaries when using dual wield.
---
it literally sucks... sometimes the only event awailabe is "the leader of a pack" and last night i managed to fail even this one.
---
I'm pretty sure the data for the armor mods is there, from what I've read/seen in videos, the files are on the server, just not "turned on", which is why it's so amazing to me that they won't just turn them on with a hot fix or even 30 minutes of down time at 2AM
---
That’s what the search function is for,
---
Good. Maybe theyll see that we dont need their silly events to depele us of junk. We need them to fix the damn game.
---
They're legitimately just trying to get Day 1 players and day 1 Fallout 1st players to empty their coffers.  There is another shoe to drop here, there has to be a reason they are trying to bankrupt scrap supplies.
---
Oh yeah souvenir items are certainly good choices.
---
Yes I understand they dont want it to get boring but not everyone can Invest that much time just for a single item
---
(laughs in bloodied gauss minigun)
---
Seriously? Those don’t even make the same sound!
---
On top of that, the ammo machine from the Raiders doesn’t even make a sound, unless I just have my volume too low to here it.
---
No. Steel is easy to grind and is literally everywhere. Concrete is not.
---
gets me wondering; what sort of mods could we expect to see? I'm assuming not the "Thomas The Train in place of Scorchbeast" type..
---
Then pacifists have to stay out of workshops.  I'm seeing conflictions already
---
This had crossed my mind. I still use 4\5 of my sentinels combat armour because my crafting luck has been so bad. In theory the SS stuff is better, if you actually roll it which is a big if. At least I got my unyielding\lockpick chest so I have a jet pack I guess. If it's the same grind\rng for the bos stuff, I don't think I have it in me to do it again
---
There is no why dont we. We already have. Past tense.
---
It was fun in Skyrim, but there was also a counter to it. I like the flying mechanic but it definitely gets annoying when they zoom off a mile away or never land. It just need better polishing so it extends a major boss fight without making us sit on our hands wondering if momma SBQ is coming back
---
I haven't seen the event so I am not donating, it is because I am on this subreddit that I know the event exists but I haven't seen anything about it in game.
---
Dunno, but honestly nothing is more discouraging than doing that many rolls and seeing exactly how bad the RNG is. I’m talking about thousands of nocturnals. Thousands of 1 stars.
---
Aaronholt has all kinds of free food and a junk extractor. It’s an awesome location. Gotta deal with low level enemies but you get corn, tato, razorgrain, cranberries, mutfruit, meat from dogs and bugs, powerarmor stand in the barn and the occasional wolf hoard and sheepsquatch.
---
Oh God, that means I caused some serious lag on line in the sand yesterday. 
---
Back in stash she goes.
---
Get 4 pieces od gear with weapon weight reduction(wwr) it will give you 80%weight  reduction on them(also on mods ).
---
always amazes me people think its a real challenge and not the in game timer...
---
I still keep mine in my stash, idk when to use it
---
Can't satisfy everyone.  If they make it even remotely hard thousands of super casual whine they'll never complete their SCORE.
---
Root of the problem is that NW is a dumpster fire with major day 1 bugs, grossly oversized map making 99% of your playtime being waiting/traveling/looting and not at all engaging or fun.
---
They didn't ask that particular guy for supplies, no.  They DID ask for supplies:
---
 [https://twitter.com/BurbangoCx/status/1278337481293914112](https://twitter.com/BurbangoCx/status/1278337481293914112) 
---
"...supplies for construction and repair are to be delivered to the ATLAS Observatory in anticipation of our arrival."
---
I should definitely do that. Selling ammo is fine as it's all for 1 cap each but the plans take so much longer
---
Good luck! I wish I had first hand experience with that, but I’m afraid that’s all I can do.
---
But I do know of one more - head to Clarksburg, have 12 int and look for an npc. I won’t spoil any more, but they’ll have a unique junk for you. There also might (keyword - might) be a lesser version of the same item for passing a charisma check first, but I don’t know for sure.
---
I can confirm the super mutant parts are still there, the head has a comfy ppace next to the scorched head. As for the instruments I've been looking out for those for a bit now and I heard they are usually in different abandon busses (like the harmonica in camdon park and I think another at the new river gorge bridge.) As for the range targets I wish I had a spare of those to put up.
---
For me some glitched quest items I got look like regular junk like the "shaped charge" that I've had in my camp since pre-wastelanders/wild Appalachia (like I quit while the sheepsquach was still a big secret deal) and I've never thrown it sway but I don't wanna display it cause it's literally an unused can.
---
Honestly concrete is one of those mats that have never been priority for me. I only use them extensively when building a new camp, and with my new underground bunker I've never needed more than the two required to clip past the cliff wall. 
---
Meanwhile, I've got 11k steel as of my last Line in the Sand.
---
&gt;9.NO WITCH-HUNTING
---
It's kinda weird that there's not like, "patch notes" for each hot fix somewhere in the game. I understand not taking up the notification box on the top right of the home screen, but it'd be nice to see a frequency of fixes, especially if it's something you've been trying to do but gave up on because it wasn't working
---
EDIT: No idea why Rule 9 forced itself up there
---
They might have a clue...

Try it hopefully it works for you too! Yeah the plans were the problem especially when you have a vendor and a half full it's like why😭
---
I've been playing nearly everyday since the update and have a full set on two characters.  3 uny and 2 bolstering on one and 3 uny and 2 cham on the other.  Its been a grind for sure
---
And we get to hear about for the 100th damn time.
---
At least you can get lots of cork foraging super mutants and their pipe rifles.
---
Ah yeah I've met her, I accidentally scrapped it cause it was super valuable. Though I did find it's name funny cause it seems like a place holder name given how you obtain it.
---
As someone who only pays for a month of FO1st here and there, I only had around 450 concrete in my stash box.  I ended up doing a round on the map and collected all the concrete I could find, made up the rest of the 250 from my stash for one turn in so I could say [I turned something in](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EOX_2n_WsAAhdZE?format=jpg&amp;name=small) and didn't do anything more.  It's not only that it isn't worth the work, the work is almost impossible.
---
I hope you're right. It would be much nicer to have them simply give the rewards out. I'd actually be fine with them bumping the numbers as long as they admitted it.

So what you're telling me is that you're too lazy to trade up and get said gear. A basic set of assassin's sentinel isn't hard to come by if you look around.
---
Yeah and as bethesda can check who donated how much it would be suicide for any duper to just donate lets say 100000 concrete.... And why would they even do that? Kind hearth?
---
Party favor bonus plus stackable xp bonus for an hour. You can check your effects section in your pip boy next time you use one to see what I’m talking about.

+25% exp bonus also

If you're on PC just get the perk loadout mod. You can change even one card faster not to mention an entire build.

The collections and the arrival of the PoS BoS are two separate event, so failure won't affect anything. 
---
But how hilarious would it be if Bethesda turned around and delayed the BoS patch until all the supplies were there regardless of how long it took ...i would laugh so hard 😂
---
Unfortunately not, the only paints available in game for the T-60 are the BOS paints
---
Well, I understand they said they are going to do it so from that I surmise it is doable. It has been almost two years. FO1st has been around for at least one year. I think a lot of people would find mod support an attractive selling point and would answer much criticism about new content. I suggested that if they put more resources into THAT rather than "SCORE" or "PROJECT ATLAS" or the crappy additions like project paradise that they would have it by now and be in much better shape. So what don't i understand, troll? and what does OP mean?
---
Yea, it's bad.  I got a ton of life saving ones too.
---
I'm trying to make a bloodied gauss shotty for a couple weeks now.  I have an AA, Instigating, 2S and Junkies.  but I want bloodied.  It's stupid I cannot even trade those others either cause they're pretty good.
---
Damn, that is some commitment right there. I just about buried myself rolling 50 at once, so silly. Won't be doing that again
---
How do you get those?
---
This is the most important post in this thread.
---
anything is better than the current 'more nukes' plan
---
I used the balloons for a while as well but switched to presents.  You can't walk through either but the presents are short enough you can walk on/over them.  I kept getting caught on the balloons.
---
I don’t think nuka cola can fix a broken limb. So unless you have a complete adamantium skeleton, you better bring some stimpacks.
---
More likely SOL. Tell him not to carry junk, yes we know the stash is limited, he needs to sacrifice some other stuff and keep a small set of junk in his stash. At some point he will lose his junk sooner or later if he carries it, either a server crash etc ... else he just has to be prepared to lose it now and then and collect it all over again if this is how he wants to play. Too risky in my opinion but junk is generally easy collected, so not the end of the world.
---
I dont see them admitting it but in either way I wouldnt be surprised tbh.
---
“Oh oh oh, I want to sing a song for yooo-ou.”
---
Agh run, it’s the dread Fasnacht Collectron, the most feared enemy in the game! I’m just trying to vendor hop in peace, and then this unkillable nightmare starts stalking me with its implacable festive tones!
---
that's funny
---
You have a chance of earning them from the repeatable quest Forbidden Knowledge. Which is where you turn in Technical Data to camp Venture
---
Though you earn them by rank. Like Knight is first and the so on.
---
Locking extractors doesn’t make much sense anyways. Unless someone has been by in the last 15 minutes you should always be close to full. I leave my wood, collectron, and water nodes open all the time and almost always collect full amounts when I check.
---
I like to collect the little chess pieces that use the old robot models from Fallout 3/New Vegas.
---
Its ok to be wrong.
---
Let the fucking BoS bring their own materials.
---
If concrete were slightly easier to get other 68 per hour...
---
I spent two hours on a private server to get a third turn in completed and then said fuck it.
---
Mods are also a fine line between what is acceptable and what gives unfair advantages.  Likewise the game doesn't have your chacters locked to a single server. So finding the balance takes a while.
---
On top of that every game has priorities.  And mod support is on the low end because of the MP nature of the game.
---
I’m so sorry, my friend. That’s probably gone.
---
If it’s an atom shop loot bag, maybe, maybe he can stand on it. If not? He’s probably screwed.
---
Edit: You may be able to move the bag by dropping something else. I’ve never tried it with dropped loot, so I’m unsure if it works, but it’s worth a shot, though I don’t think it would.
---
I learned this the hard way back in beta when I died a few times and some other player took everything. After that, I learned that junk has to go into the stash, even if it makes it extremely full. If you keep it all on you, it’ll disappear, one way or another.
---
I’d advise reserving the stash mostly for junk, and a few keepsake items, and if you’re a merchant, selling items.
---
Workshops are PvP zones, sorry you can't handle it. The reason the PvP community has dwindled is because of bethesdas modifications to how PvP works. In the good ole days I could burn down your camp and murder you with slap damage, me and my friends would police line servers and kill anything that moves. Count your blessings and don't complain about the one last way I have to grief you. There's others to force you into PvP, so when you're getting griefed next just put your junk in a bag, say "thank you mr.nekrosias". Then move on with your day. Btw a 1 star unyielding set is cheap af, combine it with a piece that has both unyielding and chameleon, get a bloodied anything with rapid fire, and you can PvP just fine. Bullets and high damage kill people. It's also a really cheap PvP setup. So it's your lack of ingenuity for not winning. You can trade for all the things you need with about 3 good weapons maybe 2.
---
Even if they don't admit it at least we'd get the camp bits lol.
---
Those are always a classic, it's easy to take the ones from the frat house but I still challenge myself finding the ones labeled as the robot models.
---
Ha! All i want is that 50% off sale in the purveyor
---
Chain!
---
also they can give you a disease that somehow magically decreases your range damage by either 15-25%
---
Yeah same. First chest 3* unyielding. Now the best i got is 1* from i don't know how many rolls
---
Yeah I swear every time I gift out a marsupial to a low level they lose their shit, it’s like new game
---
Copying fortnite is not a good idea, copying is never a good idea. They need to go beyond the concept of ever changing map, they need to make something new that will make f76 special. Fallout76 will never be a great game by trying to be like other games.
---
Amen to that lol!
---
Haven't heard that before
---
Yea i wait until I played lightly and don't have scrip before spending mods now so I don't become overweight with useless hunters or nocturnal chest pieces.
---
Ohh thank you
---
Getting beyond the uninspiring rewards, it seems like an unreasonable ask anyway. Concrete is way different than steel. I don't have much concrete on hand , I tend to use what I have, run out, then have to go get more. It's not like steel where you end up with loads of it after clearing a mob or two. 
---
If this was some sort of play to get people to clear out their duped junk, then they really needed to go all out on the donation prizes.
---
I don't think the current system is good. They should remove PVP from adventure mode entirely, and replace it with a deathmatch style system where players can build their own custom arena's at workshops and other places like in GTA V.
---
Something cool and less tedious. Like PVP events where players can submit their own pvp warzones, the prize being taking over the workshop and extra caps/exp. No ammo used up, basic weapons and power ups set up around map to make it a balanced experience.
---
This would be better than allowing players who have unfun, badly designed  PVP armor who just one shot players and grief them who don't even need the workshop. Also there is no way to stop them from constantly coming back over and over.
---
Sorry but the current system is just bad design that empowers griefers. Don't believe me? Look at what happened to survival mode.  
---
You drop more than junk, and a bunch of players with duped bloodied explosive weapons who just shoot the ground where you spawn so you die before you get a chance to move.
---
Damn! I have yet to find a single fixer. My main has nearly 400 hours and is close to lvl 180 (yeah yeah I could be higher level, but I fuck around a lot)
---
If they want players to make real effort, Bethesda need to make rewards worth pursuing.
---
You could have answered this yourself by just opening your pipboy.
---
It's about half way down in these pics:

---
It honestly might be. It holds a permanent spot in my stash with a nuka-scorched, an Enclave stealth boy and a Stimpack diffuser.
---
The other one is supposedly the medium int rock. Not sure how you get it, though.
---
There are three different styles of typewriter.

And disappoint Roger Maxson? Never

I have one of each of Ward's precious stolen items on display in my raider themed camp, with a big glowing sign behind it that reads "Finally..."
---
I also have two Viable Scorchbeast DNA from Heart Of The Enemy, an Irradiated Ore from Radiation Rumble, a Box of Shooting Targets, and a few Bolton Greens Centrepieces. Really trying to get my hands on the Occult Tomes from Campfire Tales, too. Always on the lookout for these glitched Misc items tbh haha

This is a dangerous game you're playing friend. I wish you well
---
but this time the Ghillie suits will be black. and because they copied the suits from season 1 when those were first made, they will have the exact same bugs that the current ghillie suits had before they were fixed. and don't worry, it will only take a month or two to fix them which will cause more bugs all of a sudden. I wouldn't be surprised if it ascendingly deleted peoples armor with the fix
---
No I cannot, so I gotta buy that pack
---
I honestly think the servers have differnt rng seeds and that some of the servers cannot give out unyielding just to make it rarer. So I don't craft until I get an unyielding drop then, on the same server, I start crafting. It's worked - I have my full unyielding USSS set on less than 100 rolls, though one piece is 2\*
---
feels like someone(s) behind the scene is constantly trying to sabotage this title
---
Yeah, its pretty sad. No random encounters, nothing exciting, just a npc and a crate. If you didn't read about it out of game you wouldn't even know its going on.
---
Last i remember personally seeing it was around a year ago when it was "vaulting"
---
What is sentinel armor? I see that in posts from time to time
---
and fresher sandwiches!
---
&lt;THEMACGOD still dies&gt;
---
From one heavy weapons user to another, weapon bash and it will stop
---
I was PvPing before I got "PvP armor" and I was still wiping the floor with you foodbuilds. There really is no excuse not to trade for better items, and definitely no excuse to not get better at the game.
---
Everyone talks about removing PvP from adventure mode and replacing it with a whole new system when they could just...fix the system they already have set up.
---
Idk man. My 3 star shotgun with +33% Vats accuracy is fuckin shit up.
---
if they are all the same color, you can add a terminal to the power line to change them ALL at once
---
I've only found them since the new update and they went into the event drop pool. But I do loads of events a day trying to get the rare outfits.
---
Anyone thinking this is an event is kinda silly.
---
I hate it when people split up their vendors. I found 1 yesterday that had 4 vendors in completely different places in their camp. Since it was a lvl 356 with hundreds of plans, I had to track them down, but it was stupid as hell
---
We donated at least 3x as much steel as we needed. Concrete isn’t that difficult to find if you’re running extractors or porting to the right places. Definitely can find 1/3 of the steel we donated.
---
Well i just moved and rebuilt my camp so although concrete usually piles up, i only had like 180 left so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Good to know!
---
There’s the BoS paint as mentioned, or alternatively if you like Nuclear Winter you can unlock some paints for the T60 through that. It’s a grind, but it at least isn’t a microtransaction I guess
---
Glitch misc items are fantastic to have and as much as I have sided against raiders I think it's insanely cool to put on display stolen stuff from ward for a raider camp.
---
As for the occult tomes I don't think I've heard of those but I'll be on the lookout. Only thing I've got from that event is left over kindle.
---
That luck bonus ain't worth shit. 🤕
---
The original post that I saw had it listed as 150,000 - I was like "if that's the whole community, that'll probably work." [MFW](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-02/enhanced/webdr06/21/15/grid-cell-16820-1393014171-2.jpg) it's millions, not thousands.
---
Living in a van down by the river
---
Hey buddy, Big iron&gt;Johnny guitar&gt;ain’t that a kick in the head
---
Idk why the hell Bethesda thought concrete would be a great item to donate, especially 150 million of it, who the hell has copious amounts of concrete. And cork also?
---
Some weapons are working fine, like the railway rifle. I don't have enough experiences with shotguns to say personally how well they're functioning in VATs.
---
True. I’ll do that too thanks
---
People can just paint your set as well. You don't have to get the plans yourself
---
Then get griefed bud, I see a workshop I take it, I take servers for sport. It's my gameplay, I have like 3weapons mule accounts filled on all 5 characters each. The only gameplay I have left is to grief folks, I have endless supplies. Talk to people and they give you stuff, I was given 20k of each material just for chatting. I think the reason you need to grind is probably because you are unlikeable
---
The Brotherhood of Springs secretly rules them all. He who controls the springs controls the universe. (Followed closely by the Brotherhoods of Adhesive and of Ballistic Fiber.)
---
When do we even get the first reward?
---
Thank you ☺️
---
I guess that’s was tied to BoS themed
---
Most likely they are delaying updating it because they are not sure what to do. I imagine that they thought we would be further along than we are. So they are trying to decide if they should 'help' it move along or not. Just a guess.
---
Most of those excuses are valid.  The loot for making these donations are worthless.  I have all if them already.  Why would I stop doing what I enjoy in the game to search/grind concrete when there is literally no reward for doing so?
---
I hope they don't go down I enjoy it
---
Thank you very much :))
---
I got a fall damage leg piece and I added cushion to both.  I have found you need to use the jet pack in spurts when falling and it helps a lot.  Using it at the last second does not do much.
---
Considering I got the high int rock, I think the medium int rock is failing the int check with the npc you told me about up until a certain point.
---
I rolled a 2 star unyielding secret service chest first time with +1 PER. Is that good? Or should I keep trying for a 3 star? Sorry this is all quite new to me
---
Fair enough. What is your main thing? I’ve been told after the waste landers only rifles are reliable in VATS
---
I don't want to engage in pvp since it's broken and unbalanced. I don't want to spend another 3 months looking for PVP gear and only find one piece.
---
I just leave the server and go somewhere else when someone attacks. There is no way to stop a person from coming back over and over again and griefing you who doesn't need the workshop.
---
Stop forcing your bullshit onto me.
---
95% of the time i don't even get attacked, pvp is the last thing i do at a workshop.
---
I can get 90+ every few minutes, but it requires server jumping with a friend.
---
Appreciate it. I'll play with this and see how the timing changes things!
---
1 month level 274... lunchbox parties are the best
---
Agreed it surely is impossible. They ran the easiest junk item first which drops ones motivation for the boxes. They also have nothing new in the boxes so there's no reason for heavy players to push for the boxes. I expect all of the items to fail from here. Sort of embarrassing for Bethesda to either over estimate their players and worlds junk or our drive to spend time grinding.
---
K
---
Well more for you :D I can just about handle all the stimpaks now I can't deal with anymore haha
---
I don’t even understand this event. You get the Atlas supplies box, and then if we get all of the supplies deposited, anyone who contributed will get the bigger (and sort of lackluster) prizes at the end of that period? I’m usually a really big supporter of events, etc. but this just feels pretty underwhelming and I don’t like giving away all my scrap for a bottle of whisky and a stimpack.
---
Bookmarked, thank y’all
---
We donated 3x Steel because it’s literally the most common resource in the game aside from Wood. Most scrap items and practically every single weapon can be scrapped for Steel. There’s almost no junk items that produce Concrete, and extractors produce concrete at such a slow rate that its ridiculous. While I do agree that people not wanting to participate is certainly a factor, claiming that this goal was easy to meet is just unrealistic
---
Yeah I did wonder why steel (the easiest resource to collect) was the least required
---
You’re exactly right. I wanted to help and donate all my concrete that I’ve got. I went over there to donate but I couldn’t since I only had about 150 :(
---
Looks like it. If you bought that pack previously you should submit a ticket though!
---
Handmades. They don't work in PvP and they've been iffy in PvE, even more so lately.
---
Yup.  I’ve been around long enough to already have all the plans being rewarded (per the data-mined list, anyway) and to learn how much of what materials I typically need :)
---
Where do you see the counter? I cant find it and feel dumb
---
It won’t change the strain on the servers, but it will change the strain on the clients, which is huge. Bethesda can upgrade the servers. They can’t upgrade the minimum specs for the game now that the game is out, nor can they upgrade your consoles/min spec PC’s. That’s been the real bottleneck behind camp Budget.
---
Thanks for the help! /s
---
Sort of the opposite actually.  The way the atom shop works when you get something new it equips it for NW.  So pick up the beret and suddenly your stealth bush wookie gillie head is now the much more visible beret.
---
Not likely...
---
75% chance to avoid 15% damage while standing still. They stack as well. Cavaliers is the same, but while running
---
Yeah if I wasn’t paying attention online, I would 100% not even know that there was an “event” going on. 
---
I mean I know there’s a BOS event and it still doesn’t even feel like it’s in the game because no one seems to care, no one is actually next to the BoS Atlas area, and I’ve personally stopped donating after doing it once lol
---
It would be better if they would allow us to donate what we have instead of 250 at a time cause for example, I only had 300 left over and then I donated the 250 pieces and wasn't able to donate anymore. I would like if they dropped it to at least 50 so then we can donate more if we want to.
---
This is a social game. If you look around enough and talk to enough people, it won't take you 3 months to get *one piece* of gear.
---
Cork conquers all
---
Tank that would work as a turret, i'd use it even if it would take  90% of the camp budget
---
Remember, no Knight!
---
Sweet-thanks! I had no idea it was in the effects amongst all my mutations, food, chems, etc.
---
Question 1: Did you help take the workshop?
---
Question 2: Did you subsequently help to defend the workshop?
---
Question 3: Did you contribute to any repairs? 
---
If you answer no to any then you can suck my hairy kiwi fruit. Plenty of other workshops you can take over, maybe not concrete but that's life.
---

where's the funny part?
---
Honestly, if the Atlas Donor supplies loot pool just included T-60 plans and the BoS power armor skins as rare drops tacked onto the lame loot pool we got, I would have absolutely grinded for more provisions.
---
O yeah. Agreed. My buddy gave me one before I switched to a shot gun build. Didn’t see the hype.
---
Its a set up.  They have to make it look like we failed so when they tell us we fail on something we actually WANT, they can say, "No, remember the concrete, you failed that one too."  Bethesda doesn't care and it shows in their patch notes.  They use to fill it with a bunch of bull like they fixed a light in the bathroom.  Now, they don't even try!  "You can now buy pocketed and deep pocketed limbs for the secret service armor" except, there are no plans for it.   If this doesn't prove to everyone that they really don't care about what is actually wrong with their game or the simple fact that they have no problem telling us this 7gig update will include this or something else that won't be available, then not actually do half of what they said in their patch notes, then there is no hope and you can continue playing this (or any other "Brokethesda") game.  Just do me a favor, and when RUST comes out, stay here and enjoy this shitty game while the rest of us go off to play a real game made by people who actually give a crap!
---
Yeah they mighta reverted that transaction, sad times, I'll submit a ticket
---
Why do people keep saying that? It means we can start enjoying the game properly!
---
One of my teammates found all the SM parts a couple nights ago, so yea, they are still there.
---
Damn I wish I would've known! I was just opening boxes to free up some storage lol
---
The cork goal seems very unlikely too. I had plenty of steel in my stash but I've got... 12 cork. 
---
I don't really understand the decision to set short periods for each item rather than setting goals for each but having them running for the entire length of the community alpha.
---
I use a gauss shotgun as my main and all it takes is lead and steel to make the gauss bullets. no gunpowder needed!
---
Apply the max level Starched Genes perk and any serum consumed will be permenant  until the perk is removed. Incredibly useful when paired with Class Freak which reduces the negative effects of mutations.
---
I only have 1 unyielding secret service piece, it was a 1 star chest!
---
Some of my concrete data was actually from the beta.
---
👍
---
I saw him there this morning. Only had a purple ski outfit on him, so it was pretty disappointing, but he was there.
---
Not really the greatest community event. Feels like Bethesda wants to purge scrap boxes and in return we get loot crates. I dropped some steel last week and I actually got more items from other players dropping all the items they received from their crates. I’d rather hunt mole miners or craft gifts personally. It was a good attempt to try and get the community involved while putting something out with this patch other than an event that the community can’t activate. However, the community prizes are either lackluster or they’re week/weekend long bonuses, sales, or events they’ve done in the past. My issue with this is that the community wasn’t expected to hand in their hard earned scrap to trigger those bonuses before. I also have a sneaky suspicion that, other than these prizes, this event will not effect future content. What are they going to do? Not release the DLC they’ve been talking about for months? I guess The Brotherhood of Steel isn’t coming after all you guys. Pack it up Russel. 😂

Old school rigged fuses. Instead of pennies someone used caps.

Bolstering on secret service is amazing though!
---
Ahh thank you!! Hopefully they roll it out soon
---
How do you manage that with the carry weight limit? I can’t stand how realistic they got with the weights, I spend far too much time now just trying to free up space. There are some aspects of the game they really didn’t need to make so realistic, the system with past fallouts was fine, just like the building system of FO4. Both are now more frustrating and limiting in 76.
---
Use that big noggin a little bit - run pharma farma and just run around searching every chest.  You'll find some naturally and the perk will give you plenty more, plus rad-x so you survive even longer.  It is still technically RNG, but I've been running PF since the first "Use X stims" challenge and it now has a permanent place in my build because of just how all-around useful it is.
---
Fix the damn gauss rifle vats for christ sakes
---
Ah, good to know, forgot about them.
---
This
---
lol?
---
I guess before? Because those events happen in Fallout 2 and 3 right? And also BoS getting defeated in Appalachia does not mean the end for them. Majority of the BoS forces are still in the Lost Hills bunker right? The upcoming Neo-Appalachian BoS under the command of Paladin Leila Rahmani, is nothing more than a relatively small scouting force right?
---
Anyways BoS sucks pee-pee. Enclave rules.
---
I'm so ready for a break from this game. I've promised myself that on 1st September I will be buying the rest of the levels to be done with the season. (currently on 80 or 81).
---
It's starting to feel way too much like a second job on 76
---
Exactly!😂
---
No since u can just unslot the perk
---
Thought flux was destroyed if you die in a nuke zone.  It's something like that, I never figured out exactly when it gets destroyed or not.
---
I'm doing it later. Thanks again.
---
To be clear, you HAVE finished Wastelanders right? 
---
This daily only opens up after finishing wastelanders.
---
Dont bother with those, there is a house in Lewisburg I think? That has a couple hundred burned books.
---
Hmmm.. If you do the glowing bug to boost your pets level, what is the highest level a dog can spawn at?
---
If I find one I'll let you know, my level 91 glowing deathclaw has been nigh invincible since I learned how to boost him
---
The difference between this and last time is the previous event was just kill a bunch of scorched (something people do anyway). This event requires players to donate resources with little payout. It’s not nearly as fun or engaging. While I appreciate a new NPC, it just wasn’t a well-designed event. Simple as that. There wasn’t even much in-game to tell people where to go and what to do. That’s a pretty big problem IMO. With clean up Appalachia, everyone was participating whether they knew it or not.
---
150m concrete?!? Did they really think we were hoarding that much in our FO1st scrapboxes?
---
Even if I _were_ hoarding concrete the way I hoard other mats, the most I'd have on me would be 1000, the same as with others that don't see consistent use.
---
I’d keep it until you have a full unyielding set, then work on improving the legendary effects of the weaker pieces.
---
Ad Victorium! You Enclave jerks sold out your own civilians and allowed unethical and even nightmarish experimentation on them without their consent or them even being aware of what was happening. 
---
I hold dear to the ORIGINAL ideals of our founder and first Elder. The Wulf Pack shall bring the BoS back to its origins and the ideals laid out by Elder Maxson. I hope to once again bring about cooperation with the Responders again and with the settlers of Foundation.
---
So, that's why people keep nuking my base :(
---
Because you are using your own Caps and not duplicating, I can't see them banning you for it. Maybe give you a week extra cool down.
---
I rarely collect concrete to the point where I'd have excess to donate.  Steel made sense but concrete and cork are going to be a challenge to actually get the astronomical amount they are looking for with this event.  If everyone just had to put in a little bit and we'd succeed, that'd be one thing for the very simplistic rewards being provided.  The Treasure Miners and Faschnacht gave way better rewards for much less effort, I just don't get it.
---
I donated 1k steel, saw the rewards, and never went back and never will. There is no point at all and the rewards are not worth the effort.
---
Ghouls are your friend. They drop tons of Stimpaks, rad-x and radaway
---
Agreed. Regardless of the rewards, donating that amount of concrete was a long shot to begin with IMO
---
It’s specific to timing after the queen fight afaik, but same, I’ve never exhaustively investigated it. 
---
I believe it’s something like “still within range of the queen fight area, within 10 minutes of her death”. I’m *pretty* certain it’s not just “in a nuke zone”.
---
exactly and change it to 76000 hours 👍
---
I feel like the T60 skins should only be from tech data. They should've had those same skins come from ATLAS drops, but for T51 armor instead of t60.
---
sunnytop athletics course. takes like 1 minute to run and you get aid for days.
---
just run down. disable traps as you go. finish. fast travel to top. rinse and repeat.
---
OR! do other stuff and buy them.
---
Not about the bloodied life on this character. Do run bloodied on my rifleman though.
---
I have 500 carry weight, junk weight reducing armor, 3 ranks of packrat and I'm at my limit.  Come get some!

Thanks soooooo much

There are up to 10-11k players playing fallout at anytime(avg of about 8k this month) on steam, which is a much smaller number compared to the console playerbase and doesn’t include the ppl still using bethesda.net to run their game. We’re looking at around 30k players average. Bethesda reported the avg game session was 4 hours, so that means 30k average times the 6 different groups that would play a day. We’re talking about a community of about 150-180k. That would mean at most we’re talking somewhere around 1k concrete. A person, which plenty of ppl have a stockpile of still. If the rewards were worth it, you can easily get 1k concrete in 4 days
---
Or at least those who put them where it makes sense for them to be, instead of hiding at the bottom of a cliff when you spawn on top.
---
Big xp boost that stacks (4 of them equals 100% xp boost). They also benefit nearby players along with an additional buff which will show up in your pip boy. 
---
They are pretty awesome.
---
I like Watoga emergency services, quick run through with pharma farma is always worth it. There’s also the airport north of vaultec university, again recommend pharma farma.
---
NW has the best paint jobs in the game imo. All of them are really cool and unique aside from the Outcast paint. Well worth spending some time there during double XP events.
---
Dancing in the fire was yesterday's challenge!
---
I mean you're the one who took a workshop. It's not forced, you decided to take a PvP zone, then you're crying on reddit about being pvped. It's like that one picture of the dude on the bike with the stick, where he puts it in his own spokes and eats shit, then blames someone else. Das you. Just add a neckbeard and put him in a basement.
---
Haha, this is hilarious! Your friend is REKT. Who carries ALL of their junk and trips into a fissure??
---
"Oh boy, all this junk sure is heavy! Sure hope I don’t get killed by a **!" [*falls in radioactive chasm*](https://youtu.be/NMp5kkEqGRQ)
---
Once you're done with your build you realize there's nothing to use it on
---
Well concrete is no where near as common as steel and they want more. If I don’t get the pole anyway I’m gonna be annoyed because I want the pole more than a dam beret
---
Thanks I will check it out
---
She doesn't like how slow bolt-actions are. Honestly with the way she's going, she's going to end up going full-auto. That and pissing away all my extra ammo.
---
Before doing that - make sure you do not have any other mutations already that you do not want. Using radaway (without having starched genes equiped) has a chance of randomly removing those unwanted mutations.
---
U could lock it up behind doors
---
There is a second mole miner in the basement as well that is friendly.
---
I’ve been in the Enclave since Navarro
---
Let's just nuke ATLAS!
---
What if, they never actually made the camp objects for the concrete and cork? So now, with it coming down the line instead of actually making them, they instead just say "lets just make it impossible to reach? Instead of the original 20 mil or whatever, we make them get 150 or 200 mil?"
---
Maybe the totals weren't updated over the weekend.
---
Ign Nekrosias, add me for theft, take a workshop and fortify it
---
I've got about 4 characters that are well kitted out, none with perfect gear, but I'm enjoying them so much more now that they have decent guns than when I was farming with shit stuff!
---
Why are you surprised that a 20-year old game runs smoothly on modern computers?
---
You are the enclave why do you care?
---
This whole event is just stupid. The rewards aren’t worth giving up the materials for.
---
Mr.Gutsy with that damn projectile gun that takes 10-20% HP each shot.  
---
Or those damn bears that insta stagger the same lenght the server lags so you can almost never hit it on melee
---
I farm other people's defend event and repair their extractors constantly, only to be shot at for doing so.
---
It wouldn't have taken much. There's a ton of stuff they could have included that would have had people grinding this out. Things already in game that just have horrible drop rates but you can buy from vendors, like calibrated shock plans. Or some of the BOS outfits, like the bomber jacket.
---
\*shoots Ward's "property" back at him with a junk jet.\*
---
It won’t fail. Trust me.
---
I'll bet some clownshoe at BGSs has added a zero to the totals for laughs and forgot all about it.
---
A tenth of what we're being asked to do seems reasonable, considering the rewards. The rewards are only much use to low-levellers...and how would they even get near a fraction of the targets ?
---
It's utter ballbaggery from Bethesda. They've had bugs after bugs ruining a lot of peoples experiences...all this stuff should not be behind a target. it should be a case of anyone who completes some missions for the wannabe Brotherhood guy up there gets the gear and opens the bonus events.
---
This is just another disaster...
---
All I can see being done is the concrete reward is the freebie when the Brotherhood bundle drops and all the other targets complete as fast as the steel one did...no questions asked !
---
Communist Collectron.
---
Doesn't matter. The paladin that's on her way out to Appalachia sent out her message and it was pretty explicit in sounding like she might as well be part of the Fallout 4 BoS.
---
Is the red rocket an existing location? Would love to build a camp like this!
---
FireProof 2 is enough for standard SBs, FP3 if you're facing the queen. No Dense needed; reserve that for when a high level player with a TSE legacy gun comes after you. 
---
IMHO it's better to go with Asbestos-lined as it ups your ER _and_ makes you immune to the "set on fire" condition. Once Colossal Problem drops it'll be crucial as there are allegedly plenty of fire hazards in the mine.
---
They didn’t add it as a quest or anything...I wouldn’t have known about it if I didn’t check this sub.
---
Yet ingame the npc is the one with the idea for gathering resources and had had no contact with the Brotherhood and says he can scavenge some rewards for us.
---
Yeah, this sucks. After patch 21 I noticed my vendors were wiped out (was relieved it was in my stash instead of gone forever but still) and then noticed my display cases were all empty as well 😒 no idea why it happened but I will keep my vendors and displays blueprinted just in case it happens again
---
Honestly, how much of that steel was already in players' stashes? I don't even farm for stuff, and I have like 8k steel vs. probably 150-400 of anything else (except wood and lead).
---
I'm betting we hit that first leg so easily because many people just pulled from their existing collections. That's not going to work for the remaining challenges.
---
Just reached lv 98 and..... the outfit still lacks the helmet.
---
Also, some of these resources just really aren't collected all that much. I have only actively sought out concrete one time before this event and I got what I needed and that was it. I am a 1st member for probably 4 months now and since starting that subscription I had only amassed 500 concrete. Cork is roughly the same somewhere around 400.
---
Hmmm, well it's not like we designed them. It's enough for me just to dress my ally, though it would be nice to lend them a weapon.
---
I think you need non diseased cranberries, which afik only grow at a farm on the north west side of the map.
---
This was the prefab that is currently in the Atomic Shop :)
---
I've lost 4 days worth of dailies and 2 weeks worth of weeklies! Bethesda doesn't care and I am owed that score!
---
In the last few queen fights people have just been shooting her in the air and doing enough damage that the fight doesn't last more than 10 minutes, even if she doesn't spend that much time on the ground.
---
In the first few months after the game launched I sometimes saw queen fight attempts from people that clearly didn't know what they were doing (e.g. making fissure prime the center of the nuke zone, so we had to fight in radiation, or launching on a server with a bunch of low level characters so few people showed up equipped for the fight). Glad we don't have to deal with that so much these days!
---
Wouldn’t say it’s crucial unless you are bloodied/didn’t bring stims. To my knowledge anyway.
---
The best thing?
---
Yeah, and why didn't they did so already?
---
Maybe they know, that this action will weed out 90% of players?
---
Easiest way to deal with them is to step out in the open and wait for them to come up behind you, high jump with Marsupial when you hear them, turn around and shoot or just VATS to auto-snap to them.
---
Original poster is what op means
---
Should drop a nuke on a rad storm.
---
I would agree if it weren’t for the fact that the Donor Supplies are a one time thing that will likely never return after this event, and if it weren’t for the fact that the skins have an extremely low chance to drop from Forbidden Knowledge in the first place. (i randomly decided to try and get the ones I didnt have, and Ive been doing Forbidden Knowledge multiple times a day for a MONTH and only got ONE). Especially considering we’re likely to see new BoS paints with Fractured Steel I think it would have been perfectly fine to just re-use the existing ones, which are a pain to obtain, as a one time reward for the event.
---
XGP on PC is a mess right now.
---
I was having a similar problem with FO76 on it: Everytime I booted my PC, XGP would ask to reinstall it from scratch. That happened in two separate weeks, and another time when patch 21 landed.
---
I wish I could help you with a fix, I've tried everything I found online and nothing worked. Then I bought it on steam and it works like a charm.
---
I suggest that if you don't want to deal with it right now, buy it on steam and call it a day. Or you can wait for a fix which I believe is not on Bethesda end.
---
Any major mods will probably require private servers and new characters u can’t ever use on the main servers
---
Muhahha too late!
---
Those factions are dead and buried. It's all Enclave now baby! Basically all Vault 76 dwellers are MEMBERS of the Enclave! That is if you have completed the Main quest.
---
I don't suppose you have any advice on what makes quest items glitch like that? I want more of them really bad, but so far I only have Ward's stuff and the 3 blood samples that someone was selling in their vendor. The blood is cool at least since 2 of them are no longer even required for the quest or even in the game anymore.
---
You need to have finished Wastelanders, IIRC. You also need a working ProSnap Deluxe Camera in your character's inventory, and I believe you also must have some film on you/loaded in the camera.
---
If it still fails, I'd say you have found yourself a bug and should open a support ticket.
---
This sub and the official forum are full of posts from people refusing to donate.
---
Same honestly. Or even just recycling the BOS skins for weapons/armour they released as a Fallout 4 creation would do.
---
Well yeah the fights usually really don't last longer than 10 minutes but I just find it hard to get hits in as a melee player if they just mindlessly stagger her, I can't really talk about how it used to be, as I just recently returned to the game and didn't play it that far the first time around.
---
r/theydidthemath

Veteran Member.
---
Unless this is part of some kind quest line because we were never meant to complete it, I think they just overestimated the players willingness to do a lot for little.
---
That would be too easy!
---
We gotta have a gun fight!
---
I'm in the 90s and still getting 1/day just through some basic tactics and being reasonably efficient in completing the repeatable.  Stack a few basic buffs (bloodied/unyielding, INT food, XP food, build team, sleep) and do your dailies and the high kill-count events and it's very doable.  No need to do specific XP farm runs either really.
---
If you don't want to do that, we still have what, a month to go?  Keep up doing the challenges and you'll have plenty of time to spare.
---
Enclave rules what? the 101 ways the kill them self? or take a village of tribal-mans hostage? in that case yes they rule go enclave go rule the poo-poo you suck
---
Right now go to the wayward and look in the bags left outside people are dropping them like crazy
---
Fair. I mostly do events as well. I've gotten a couple Dragons lately. I want to display the Dragon and the Fixer side by side. Maybe today will be my lucky day
---
I'll give the BoS all of my 40mm, mini nukes, and missiles...one at a time...from their respective launchers.
---
I approve of this idea - but only if they follow you around whenever you blink like the weeping angels.
---
They needed to move the decimal place to the left on those concrete and cork ones.
---
you didnt ofrend anyone, i just explain :) cheers
---
I have 521 concrete at the moment. I am not sure if I really want to donate them. I don't need them, but I don't need any of the crap that I got in the box for my steel donation either...
---
Fortnite STW (The co-op campaign mode) 100%, but its probably not the devs fault, the ones in charge just put the Battle Royale first every time.  The battle royale isn't doing that great either, but it's turning a profit due to the sheer number of people who still play it.
---
I hear Diablo had that big problem with their mobile announcement, but not really sure.  Destiny was definitely a wreck through parts of the first game and a bit of the second. but i also hear they're better now that they're separated from Activision. 
---
While the way Fallout 76 is being handled is very shaky, it's still a more fun game at it's core than these other ones mentioned are currently.
---
Never had a dragon yet ever.
---
That is the point... but your percentage is wrong. Lol
---
I only completed far enough to steal plans for your experimental X- 01 Power Armor. I rescind any and all claims the criminal organization known as the Enclave have
---
Reloading also work it seems
---
I found a lit cigar that stays burning when displayed inside Vault 79 but there's probably more spawns for it, I bet. That always gives me a laugh when I see it burning endlessly.
---
When I try to place the munitions factory at my camp in both public and private servers, I am disconnected from the server about a minute or two after placing it down. I hope this is a fix.
---
Okay, just wanting to make sure, as it really wasn't my intention
---
Yeah, I don't expect everything for free, but if they decide to flip the script and I suddenly have to pay to play a game I already bought and didn't have to pay to play before, I'm out.
---
Goddammit I just convinced myself that it was gonna be alright if I didn't grab those junk walls
---
And then I see your rad wasteland setup and I'm like gahhh 
---
I only have like 300 atoms, and I can't buy anymore cuz I'll slide down a slippery slope
---
Ima try and get those free atoms from the legendary run, but I don't think time is on my side XD
---
Great looking base man
---
punch them bastards
---
Though I agree with OP, funnily enough the match where I had to stand in the fire was the fckn ONLY NW match I "won" so far. Basically I am very very extremely unlucky with drops and I never get what I want. Except this time. I get my favorite NW weapon (combat shottie), marine armor, a handful of stimpaks and radaways. I'm like hell naw, this can't be, how is it that the only time I get what I want is the ONE time the challenge asks me to basically die? I'm thinking, bargaining with myself, but as much as it is frustrating doing the challenge feels more important than trying to win a match of a mode that I am not that fond of to begin with. I decide to try it, spam my stimpaks and radaways, survive with a little more than half health and survive the whole match with my whole team still standing! We were the last 5 people standing, my whole team and some bush wookie I guess. At the end one of our team decides he has enough (I guess? No mic) and nukes the area killing everyone: I try to escape but I end up dying. I guess he is the actual winner in the end but it still feels like a victory if your whole team is there.
---
Yeah but for Gatling lasers and plasmas it's not recommend
---
Muahahaahha! :D
---
I know I'm lucky, but it didn't come from nothing. To keep it short, our relationship hasn't been it's best this year, and in trying to do more things together, she finally decided to try the game rather than "Are you playing that stupid game again?". To which she got hooked and found that she's actually enjoying it. None the less, I know I'm lucky.
---
Events/dailies. You get easily 100+ each in one evenings gameplay.
---
Floaters - for the Gnashers, wear at least one piece of Poison Resistance Armor; two is better, and 3 makes you totally immune.
---
For the Flamers, mod your chest piece to be Asbestos-Lined. Makes you immune to being set on fire, lowering their damage potential greatly.
---
Depends on the player. Building community stocks up on building materials, shotgunners look for plastic, i cap everything off at 200 across the board. Like I said, not saying concrete is comparable to concrete, but we got at least 3x what was necessary for an event very few people are taking srly.
---
I don’t think a lot of ppl fallout players realize how much time most mmorpg players will devote time boring tasks if they reward is right. WoW and Runescape fans will sit at their computer chopping wood or killing the same mob for hours for the sake of double xp.
---
Even if every goal was achieved 3 times over, pretty sure they're gonna either imprison this guy or kill him in the very first quest.
---
It is still showing 4.65m as of 2:15PM 8/10
---
They HAVE to reduce the numbers. This is insane.
---
Raiders also drop loads of Stimpaks. Between those two I'm constantly vendoring off stacks of Stimpaks and RadAway and can barely keep up with the way the game is drowning me in the stuff.
---
Early game build is stealth Rifleman. Melee is hard to maintain stealth until you have legendary effects/stealth perks/high agility because the closer you are the easier you are to find. And it’s easier to pull off those headshots with a scope anyway. Look up nukesdragons.com and build with a focus on Perception (rifle perks) and Agility (stealth perks). Maybe Luck too if you want Vats or just more utility (almost everyone runs Starched Genes, most people also have Class Freak, and it varies after that).
---
Melee is nice because it takes no ammo and does hit hard, but getting hit so much is hard on your armor and healing supplies. It’s still handy to have a super sledge and some power armor for Nuke Zones until you get a better handle on the game and/or get a Chinese Stealth Armor. 
---
Sell everything until you you hit the Caps cap, then scrap the gear. If you have the scrapper perk, equip it before you break down.
---
Exceptions would be for guns you use (stealth rifleman- break down those hunting rifles) until you learn the mods you want (medium scope, aligned long barrel, silencer, hardened or .50cal receiver, forceful stock, piercing mag), then sell them. 
---
Make sure you break down all your junk at a workbench. Scrapped junk is far lighter than whole bits and bobs.
---
For sure. I feel like we’ll probably see those- or a new variation of them- with Fractured Steel, but it would’ve been a nice way to make the event feel a bit more Brotherhood themed aside from a total of 4 BoS themed community rewards (one of which it doesn’t look like we’ll get and the other is just a slightly modified version of an in game outfit)
---
So today things changed a bit. At Crater, they didn't bother her. But when we were out doing quests, a low level Raider randomly spawned and came after her that was green to me.
---
Im just trying to get a set of SS with uny and wwr not caring what the other perk is. Took me only 8 rolls to get a uny/rr/wwr chest, iv crafted well over 100 LA's and no luck with that yet.
---
Private servers*
---
Private servers still require an active fallout 1st membership.
---
Imo this is Bethesda way of getting ride of the giant hoards of junk that the duppers that got unbanned still have.
---
Automatic barrel (the best in my opinion)
---
Yeah exactly. All they really had to do was make the Donor Provisions loot pool pretty much the same as the Forbidden Knowledge loot pool and it probably wouldve been way better.
---
This is a bad response. Griefing is against the rules, it's also why survival mode was canceled since players went out of their way to bully people to stop playing ...simply by farming spawn spots with explosive weapons killing you before you can move and making you lose all your stuff since you drop more than junk.
---
I would love to, but our 9mo son thinks differently.
---
If the fire damage from the environmental hazards are anything like the fire damage of high-level floaters, I'd say it's crucial even if you're a full health build. Fire damage chews through HP fast. And I don't just mean getting hit by fire attacks; I mean the "set on fire" condition which overlays an effect on you.
---
Line in the sand knocks out my 1400 daily caps with all those weaps
---
I placed it inside my camp no problem. I should've known the projector would be a let down. If the twitch prime ones didn't work I should've figured this one wasn't gonna do anything as well. At least i get some blue/purple light from it
---
Yeah I think a lot of you guys have great ideas and I would love to see some of this stuff implemented. Here's to hoping that Beth listens to us and hears our wants.  This new event is kind of eh but to be perfectly honest, I REALLY want that BoS collectron.
---
Fine by me, in fact expected, and no carry over of XP or caps or whatever.
---
No, If you want my vendors you gotta tour the camp. I didnt build it for me. I just want love :(
---
Hmm I somehow haven't finished the wastelanders story yet..I'm not even sure what I do when I hop on lol.
---
I’m glad that this is actually moaning and whining I can get onboard with. 
---
Complete lack of knowledge of their own game. Baffling haha.
---
For me, high level floaters rarely are able to get that kind of damage. Still, we’ll have to see. 
---
I don’t wanna drop cannibal for the moment if I don’t have to.
---
Got myself some glowing meat out of gutsy, hell yeah!
---
I had to skip this (optional) step because of this issue. I tried reloading but nothing beyond that because I've learned that it's generally pointless to try to work around the bugs. Bethesda is a shitshow and I have no faith in them.
---
Interesting I could only get them to be visible when I removed the wallpaper, but why would I want no wallpaper? No other wall no matter what I tried I could sort it. Yeah it is disappointing to be honest.
---
It's all good :)
---
But why would a duper even want to do that
---
You’re welcome
---
I aint gonna lie, I didnt wanted to buy it but its really what I wanted for F76 Camps really Wasteland-ish Walls. They even sink (to some extend) into the ground, making them good to place down.
---
The Car was nice aswell - all in all I would have regret it to not get it.
---
I'm saying what if Arthur Maxson's BOS (the FO4 one) isn't so far off from the philosophies created by Roger Maxson, the first Elder Maxson? What if "the evil BOS" is just "the BOS", and that's always been their MO?
---
Legit PTSD for life
---
That and power armor displays. I'd pay way too much to finally have power armor displays!
---
I cant rememebr what the perk is called but it's the one that cuts junk weight in your inventory. But yeah, he gave up trying to retrieve it.
---
If you don't have fallout 1st (I don't either) keeping so much junk can be a real drain on storage space. I've heard a few people contemplating getting fo1st "just for a few months" so they have room for all this stuff.
---
500? Man, if you’re efficient and have high luck (affects condition of found items, condition=value) you can clear the vendors in one run, all 1400 caps, with just the guns and meat, the dropped caps, scrap, and ammo is bonus. Takes being fast to be able to tag a lot of MM’s though (plus at least a couple other people there so you get large numbers spawning. Solving that event is sad, you get like 10, 15 MM’s.
---
She's literally a dirty hippie.
---
Become a junkie full health.. pop a grape nuka and leisurely stroll out of the storm
---
How could you have lost 2 weeks worth of weeklies when he fix went in last week?
---
Sorry but PVP gear and balance is garbage. Why would i want to get good at a sytem that requires no skill and just one shotting players who stack on the same effect to the point where they become untouchable gods compared to who don't have stacked nuka quatum+stimpacks+food+chem+healing factor mutation+stealthboy+full bloody build+nerd rage/evasive etc.
---
The game is poorly balanced. They need to fix PVP if players want to be interested in it.
---
Been suspecting that they'll actually be our enemies when they arrive. 
---
Wonder if their power armor will fly apart just as easily as the chinese ones do.
---
If they're not just here for another pointless grind.
---
I believe it’s currently bugged to be classed as a Casual under armor.
---
Yes... it still has not been updated...
---
I’m not going to try and explain why. But this same thing happened last fall. They clearly have a very inefficient process around updating the ticker.
---
Looking at you, Witcher 3
---
how much would you take off price wise if you had a good item but was level 35/40?
---
Sorry i hardly ever PVP in workshops,since i hardly get attacked. Why should i even consider it since it something that i barely do?
---
Known issue that's been happening for quite a while. Appears to be a lag/sync issue.
---
I wouldn't have given the little butthole anything
---
It's usually somewhere in between, in my experience.
---
If there are a lot of people on floating tents and stuff, I'll shoot her in the air to try to get aggro on the ground.
---
If it's pretty spread out, I'll let off a few if she's nearby, otherwise, just wait, pick off mobs.
---
Ah ya that would make sense
---
We will find out about that very soon friend.
---
Me and my squad beat a glowing deathclaw to death with cameras
---
Its fun. Do it in a crowd of players during a busy event (queen, line in the sand etc) and people will be very happy.
---
The glitter bomb gore bonus is quite delightful (enemies explode into a bloody mass and a bunch of streamers etc )
---
I agree, but just be aware that they’d be a SIGNIFICANT cost in camp budget.
---
The way the bugs choose who they affect is so odd.
---
I guess I'm biased, because I got two paints in under 100 tech data.
---
Over all, not since the fix, I've lost about 3 of those dailies  since the fix however, this has been an ongoing problem since the launch of the score system that hasn't been fixed!
---
&gt;  I expect all of the items to fail from here.
---
Entirely possible.  I always expected the cork to fail.  It's almost as rare as the concrete.  I'm on the fence about plastic.  It's not necessarily rare but I don't think it's easily farmable.  I'm not going to turn in very much because I need it to sell scrap to vendors.  No plastic, fewer caps.  It's science.  Wood, cloth, leather, and glass are all pretty common so those should be doable unless the concrete and cork piss everyone off enough to just not do them.
---
During a dev Q&amp;A during Quakecon display mannequins were discussed along with power armor displays as being in "the works".
---
I don't know what I do wrong but whenever I go to Abandoned Bog Town it is already looted but then I also die cuz of all the huge enemies there. I had an Epic Behemoth come pay me a visit most recently. Granted, I am only level 85, but very much not worth the trouble.
---
I gave in one 250 cement drop jic the community magically donates 145million concrete by tomorrow. but that was a silly junk material to have us donate. I gave 1750 steel, happily (and threw grenades at everything for a day, drinking some alcohol whenever there was a big boom) but concrete. ugh.
---
I'd build it..
---
In a pile of fire.. maybe.
---
FF to 7:27.
---
https://youtu.be/3lDE0MaDAHs
---
Xbox? I may have one you can have.
---
Im not
---
Steel was an easy lift, go to line in the sand or kill some super mutants then pop in scrapper, thats easy. But concrete is an uncommon resource. I dont know wtf they were thinking dangling this in front of us.
---
I was gonna make a post about this yesterday but never got round to it.
---
It even survived the kill death claw daily objectives? That thing is a survivor.
---
Displays are cool but they take up wayyyyy too much budget. I only want more display options if they lower cost. Four bottles of nuka cola in a glass case shouldnt take 25% of my budget. (exaggeration)
---
No offense, but when stuff is added to the game, they will automatically balance it. MY idea wouldn't be implemented in a bubble.
---
Again, depends on the rarity. Something like AA/EX, where it does not really scale up enough to justify using it at max item level, I'd sell for half price or less. A godroll handmade?  Not much off, because it scales well enough to still be well worth the price (I am currently rolling with a nice level 35 Bloody Reload +Limb gauss rifle, because the minor DPS loss is worth the limb and reload gains for me)
---
Thanks for the info, I appreciate it.
---
I can survive on just quantums or stims, honestly. Healing Factor reduces effectiveness of chems. 
---
I'm a junkie's build with speed demon and marsupial. I use either stims or quantums. Rarely need both. Most people are so trash at aiming that I don't need stealth boys to win a PvP match. I use them for shiggles, i.e, when I feel like being a sneaky bitch.
---
Alright what is your gt? I also might have to update the game so it could take a day
---
Yeah I already told myself I'm gonna grab the car no matter what happens, the bundle is a bonus if I can gain enough atoms
---
I miss when dailies and weeklies gave atoms so much already lmao

I wish the car was bigger tho tbh, if it was a corvega and you activated the stash by opening the trunk, that would be the decoration of my dreams haha
---
Its gonna huge
---
I just do a super slow ten minute walk to watoga to sell
---
I don't think I'm putting plastic in. I don't need the boxes and if I had some level of certainty the event would succeed I'd do it. Oh well! Too bad.
---
Thanks for the response
---
Pack rat rank 3 75% reduce weight + 1 armor with 20% reduce, so your junk gonna weight 5%. Its not a problem to carry 5-10k steel to bos box
---
Don't really care how the meta of it works since it's boring garbage with no skill where you just stack a bunch of the same effects without limit.
---
Well you get the bags in some containers, but having same amount as steel is just facepalm to death. 
---
Im vet player and done with season so will only jump on for event loot then back to other games.
---
Theres no community in game just on third party software (discord and so on), no guilds clans gangs or wte. lol gtfo devs play the game!
---
Been wondering if this is more due to less players per server causing events to spawn in the first place.
---
Not sure if theres any correlation to event spawns and player numbers, beyond the ones we can knowingly trigger ourselves.
---
I put mine to the side with a switch. You want to remove roads, its available, if not, no worries. Im a full health build, and its just polite. My issue is people dont turn off the shower when they are done with it.
---
Because it's fun to do with friends, like bloodied melee nights where you pretty much joust with melees. It's a social game, PvP is what you make it. I met a lot of my good friends by raiding workshops and they were a good sport and fought back. I've handed out legacies for people making me laugh. The gear is cheap on the trade networks for basic startups and I'll even send a build that's good for farming and pvp
---
might be unpopular opinion but magic weapons are game breaking for all of us. I don t see the point of killing her in 2mn. We are supposed to have abit of fun fighting the queen not just melt her in 10sec as soon as she lands. Hopefully those magic weps will get fixed or the people abusing it just use them when they are doing stuff in solo so it doesn t affect anyone else.
---
As a fellow fan of this kind of design, I approve
---
This just happened to me also. I have a slanted wall on both sides of my new house. I just built this house from scratch before the latest patch. I removed one slanted wall to see if the half slanted walls can be used now, which the patch notes indicated they could. Now I cannot place the original wall back, or snap ***any*** wall at all to where the old one used to be. I am so glad I only did this on one side, it's part of the signature look of my house.
---
Hopefully they revert some of these recently added placement restrictions and come up with a solution for the "double interior wall". I don't use those, but many others do.
---
I actually just "fixed" this issue this morning. Used to be you had to glitch underground to access my humble abode and wares. I bought the red rocket garage and placed it where the user is most likely to spawn so they are staring at it on arrival.
---
For me it wasn't the amount that was the problem it was that I have absolutely no reason to give up my scrap for rewards I already have. Every single "rare" plan that is in the loot table of this event I have already.
---
 I have a scrap Box with thousands of concrete that I could donate but I choose not to because the rewards aren't worth it for me.
---
 I have donated 250 metal and 250 concrete so far. I plan on only donating 250 of each of the upcoming scraps unless the rewards are different.
---
Well ideally players like yourself would carry the rest of us but there’s no way that between all of the active player base we have 450m conc between all of us.
---
Couple ways. One take out the legs they can’t move. Well actually it’s funny when they crawl to you. To being robots they take extra damage if you shoot them in the arms. 3 You can aim for the head. And if you take that out it cannot use it to laser
---
Sorry someone picked it up since. I can give you there info if you wanna try them
---
I have donated zero.  I haven't even fast traveled to Atlas to see whoever is collecting the materials.  I say to hell with Bethesda's latest grind.  This whole game is a BS grind, they expect players now to give up their precious BUILDING materials (the same building mechanic that they recently messed up), yeah, I'll get right on that Beth!
---
I never had to PVP to be social, i think you are  confused. Also you don't even consider the griefers who just ruin your fun on purpose when they are overpowered gods who stack a bunch of the same effect without limit. Why do you think they designed nuclear winter the way they did and took out survival? Because adventure PVP mode is just not that fun,and there is too much of a gap between new and old players who don't need scrap at all.
---
Also my idea  for this  thread doesn't stop you from engaging in PVP. So we are pretty much getting way off topic.
---
great work! hope it will hold when a PA stomps by....
---
I thought you don't drop junk when you die in Encryptid?
---
There is typically a couple of mobs (fog crawlers/gullets/snarled) by the pylon and the behemoth and crew by bog town. Whether the concrete is there or not is just dependent on how often it is being looted by players on that server.
---
I dropped about 2k of concrete but probably won’t do another.
---
Apparently if you base budget is near max capacity it won’t project the lights. Same for all projecting lights. If you want, you can start removing objects from your base until it projects. Sucks.
---
That better include Bethesda. Because they sure did put in on Events Calendar and called in an event in ITV.

So atm I spend pretty much all my QoL perk points on weight reduction and keep full set of unyielding with weight reduction perks. 
---
I keep everything on me but stuff I'm selling and cosmetic/ collections because perks make it more viable. 
---
FO1st was a game changer for me and these days I rarely have weight issues. I know how many people hate it or at least hate that it wasn't free but I couldn't play without it anymore tbh.
---
This is what you get when you have lazy, untested content that you haven't thought through.
---
Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind.
---
I love all of these suggestions. It really makes me excited for a truly modded ecosystem.
---
PA with emergency protocols are pretty tanky. Can die only to imposter laser or some poison, if not watch health
---
The brotherhood will turn up with 50 vertibirds full of bulk scrap and be like "get this shit off our Heli pad"
---
I hope you lose all your fingers
---
Interesting. Id hate to do that. I hired a guy to build my camp/house fully furnished 😭
---
Well i think its a bug than. Whats a support ticket ?
---
Fair enough. I include them in my statement.
---
I think you're giving whoever implemented this too much credit. If they looked at what was stored in players accounts, I'm sure they would have seen vastly more amounts of steel than they would cork, concrete, and plastic. If they saw that, then the goal for steel would have been much higher (or the goal for the others much lower). 
---
Heck, I am not a FO1st player, but I was able to contribute at least 500 steel from my stash. And then from a single session of a glitched Line in the Sand event, I was able to contribute 3,000 steel. I have been unable to contribute any concrete, I have less than 200.
---
It really seems like someone pulled these numbers out of their keester. Or **maybe** they looked at steel, saw how much people had, and just assumed the rest would be fine.
---
One possible theory: They did look, but the tool they used to look at the totals was bugged.
---
Yup, so it looks like I need to level up overseer ranks to get those skins from NW
---
Big bend is a LOT closer, only right over the hill with every workbench and a vendor.
---
He can't insult if he's dead?
---
Kinda have to agree.. I have 731 concrete and 505 corks as of now, just checking in game 
---
Scrap made sense but 150 million concrete?! That's insanely high...
---
Fortifying Atlas... aka... duper junk amnesty. The rewards vs our gift is completely unbalanced. I have currently donated nothing and have zero intensions in doing so.
---
Yes i did, so i think its a bug than
---
I roll for 3* legendary armor. It might take a while, but it's less frustration
---
Wall decor and such have been buggy since the update. I managed to get a weapon display up, but it floats off the wall.
---
That’s absurd, they would *never* do that!
---
Also a backpack is a must.
---
I suggest you to get emergency protocols for PA chest, if you dont use it already. Reduces all damage by 50% when bellow 50% hp
---
I built one of my camps near the water. Put foundations down, and a ladder. And I had a pool. Decorated everything to look like the beach chairs and tables. Put aqua boy/girl and you get to enjoy your pool. 
---
But it got boring and old real quick.
---
wouldn't they they get another month to work on it and you have to wait becuase you failed the event
---
Yeah it would be really cool to finally get some other paints eventually.  There were a couple other BOS outfits in 4 that I don't think we can get in 76 yet that I'm waiting for them to add.
---
It's another way to be social. Ngl I PvP just fine with my trash build. It's a farming build that has just enough damage to kill in PvP, and if you give a long sustained burst of damage towards a PvP build they will die without a doubt. You need concentrated rapid fire at damage cap and eventually you will break through their quantum spam. I'm the only bloodied build pvper that's left of the old guys, but it's not hard to kill the spammers, just need the right weapon. Speaking of weapons, why not take a workshop, use a bunch of lowbies with gamma guns, and PvP with eachother that way. PvP is really what you make of it. Bullets kill griefers, and if you feel overwhelmed, grab a friend. For most normal griefers you can overwhelm them.
---
If I have a choice between buying atoms for a mediocre item or playing on a modded server with endless customizable free mods... The choice is easy. They don't want gouge their own income. 
---
And I'm starting to have some growing doubts on their definition of a "modded server". I think modded means I can make outfits custom missions custom worlds add and take away buildings etc. They probably think modded means change the weather.
---
Not only that, but on deathclaw daily quest day he actually spawned as a Legendary Glowing Deathclaw when I logged in for the day 
---
I was like 👀💦💦💦
---
The whole time I kept double checking my base to make sure no loot crazy 76's tried to take him out.
---
Nobody did tho, people usually just do a heart emote and move on to my shop or something, [I think the sign I put up may be a bit of a factor ](https://imgur.com/a/SqRfPEQ)
---
That sign is glitched like the mirror you can put in your camp. It places down the first time perfectly. But if you press on it again because you want to move it to another location, it glitches and becomes invisible. 
---
Just store the item if you want to place it somewhere else. That fixes it.
---
I feel like someone posted this exact same screen shot last week. 
---
I’m having major deja vu. Maybe that particular wallpaper is bugged?
---
Holy shit
---
Find a Sheepsquatch. She'll have a field day trying to take it out.
---
A joke.  The lyrics to the Paul Simon song "You Can Call Me Al."
---
LOL the extra ammo!
---
I seem to recall being able to do something with a pipe rifle that had a faster fire rate than the hunting rifle, but still had a decent scope.  But if she wants to go full auto, I would suggest ammosmith and super duper to keep up with the bullet demand.
---
It was working before the patch and could be placed properly.  I had already placed it in my camp before the patch only to log in afterwards and see it sunken into the wall.
---
I live next to West Tek, which has 3 high level floaters next door. Before I switched to Asbestos lined from Dense, I had to be quick with my stims as soon as the flamer one started shooting at me. If I was a fraction of a second too late, the fire effect would kill me in seconds.
---
also 150 million is an insane amount for what essentially gets us nothing. if we dont hit it whats the worst that'll happen, bos just decides to not come? those bastards got fucked up once and they'll mess it up again fuck bos you're not getting my scrap
---
Gotta love this community.    Dupers get raged on, but ammo glitches get praise.   Lol.
---
Don't want to get good at broken boring PVP where you just keep stacking the same effects and become a broken god that one shots level 30 players who are just trying to get scrap for ammo.
---
Who the fuck defends fallout 76's adventure mode PVP but griefers?
---
Lol! Nope. They honestly don't give a fuck so long as people keep throwing money at them.
---
Weird. For me, I don’t have that issue. Might be something with Vanguards.
---
Ok, thanks for the info. in my case i have an AA Faster Fire Rate 90% weight reduction Handmade. that Fed76 site says probably trade only but anywhere from 16k-26k. so being lower level would that drop it out of trade only worth and into caps only?
---
FYI - Here are the 3 junk supply creates from the Seasonal event. What two junk items are missing from them...? These two items are so rare, even Bethesda can't afford to give them away! :D

"We have tons of these...but it's the principal of the thing."
---
Bunch of greedy nutjobs.
---
I ended up with 40% weapon wt, 20% ammo, one poison resist , one ap refresh, 1 agi, 1 int, 1 end, 30% block off first SS till unyielding rolls didn't feel like rolling another 100 for a slight upgrade if I get lucky. Pretty happy though I only got one trouble shooters in all that
---
This event isn't targeted at the regular players. They just went through a bunch of cheater accounts last month and saw all the duped junk/legendaries and hacked weapons they have, and let most of them go free. They knew how much of it is still out there. If they gave anything remotely interesting as a reward for this "event", the dupers would have a near-monopoly on it. As if bethesda hasn't rewarded them enough yet
---
I wip out my two shot ultracite Gauss Gatling and tag her as much as I can before she lands. I go to a tent return the weapon to the box and lightly tag with my VE 50. This way I guarantee I have enough slap damage for the loot and I do it before she lands so she isn't one shot killed. This has been flawless for me. SBQ is no longer a challenge. The challenge is getting the slap damage in before she's killed.
---
There is a location, which I will not share, where it is possible to construct your camp in a way that it gives the appearance of a pool.
---
I can solo a silo easy, any of them. In fact, whenever I run this, and some fool comes into my silo I usually get on chat and start yelling at them to gtfo and go to another silo. 100% of the time the either ignore me or can't hear me and they completely remain a waste of space the entire time. We end up with only 1 silo filled, we always complete because I can solo this and never fail, but the rewards are garbage because no one seems to grasp the concept of filling a different silo. -\_-
---
I didn’t know you could lock them.
---
Are they locked by default or is it something you have to do to it?
---
It’s been a while since I’ve done that but I think you have to find Penelope’s bedroom somewhere upstairs. There is a terminal to create the key card in her room.
---
The dataminer discord is pretty good
---
So one caveat, Bethesda made a PvP damage cap at 110, most players health is 200+, there is no one shotting, it's multiple bullets. I usually use a melee because it's funnier, run around even though I got sent gear. Just have fun, have a laugh. People still die and claim hacks. There's no such thing as a PvP God, the builds are quite simple and straightforward.
---
Too bad due to mods you can't even do that...
---
What if it makes your head hit box super tiny like the new loot duffel bag?
---
Nice! This says Fallout!
---
I’ve rolled a complete set of SS, one at a time until I was happy with the piece. I have two UNY, two mutants (if your mutated) and a chameleon. One has ap refresh speed, one has sneak, one has weapons 20% lighter and one has ammo 20% lighter. There’s also some STR and AGI in there. I probably crafted 30 pieces— son’t know what you guys are doing wrong!?
---
But if you think i am a lucky bastard you should see what i got on my first gauss mini roll!
---
Exploited ammo factory things make noise. Not the raider one
---
Do we scrap all junk
---
you can just do it on a public server and people will join in
---
Waaaaay too much for way too little.
---
And the password is on the bar, it’s her date of birth if I remember correctly
---
I may be a dummy but I tried this last time and I couldn't figure out how to deploy my camp, I've never played NW
---
This is amazing. I love that it's failing
---
True, plus it is our fault for not emptying our stashes after all
---
You shouldn't at a public event, but it does happen.  I'm not sure what causes it, like being nuked counting as a PvP kill, or if it's just a random bug.
---
I'm waiting for the patronising, passive-aggressive ItV post about "oh its a shame that the community couldn't quite meet the target. We hear your feedback etc."
---
It's like me in real life. Stopping for my stamina to recover every 30 seconds
---
they're trying to get us to empty them that way when they increase stash size junk doesn't go missing
---
PVP is badly designed in this game. Sorry this is why survival mode failed. IF you can't understand this, then it's not my fault.
---
Who the hell wants to PVP in a game that is so badly optimized anyways? Can't even craft food without lagging in the menus on xbox one. Can't even switch my weapons in nuclear winter without lagging half the time.
---
This could be broken in the same way Carleton Mine was.  u/LadyDevann?
---
I gave up dumping steel when my reward was the following:
---
Wine
---
Vodka
---
Nukashine
---
I mean.  WTF is that.  4 thing I literally don't use nor do most others....
---
No more Atlas for this guy
---
just concrete, nothing else?
---
Answer is simple - lazy content that wasn't thought through.
---
Devs not playing the game surely doesn't help either...
---
Hmm possibly! I'll let them know so we can take a look at this one as well. Thanks for the tag!
---
Waterborne disease basically means you might get a disease. 
---
It’s not a specific disease. It just warns you that you could possible get a random disease that you could get in fo76. 
---
It’s as if the game is telling you “you could get sick”
---
You could get a cold. A fever. Nausea. Etc. It’s not a specific sickness. It just means you “could” end up getting one.

---
 &gt; Again, I'm only human here.
---
I've got the safe room access card, this one is an actual key itself
---
Yeh plus who Tf duped concrete.
---
Another handy tip: you can skip the opening animation by pressing buttons if you’re opening one up while in battle.
---
A duper would have all of the plans learned that drop from the event. 
---
There literally no reason for veteran players to join in with this.
---
At sight Charlie. Between the building and mountain side are about 5 to 7 bags of concrete.
---
I had the same setup. People never turn it back off. I finally took it away. I had it out as a courtesy but it drove me nuts people always leaving it on.
---
Hmmm. Well my memory is too vague to help you further at the moment I’m afraid.  Hopefully someone else can respond with a bit fresher memory of it.
---
I've been finding more and more idiotic shaped camps with vendors scattered about in even worse locations.  It's gotten really bad.
---
I've stopped spending my caps at those places.
---
If I have to check 8 dumb shaped mini-buildings and hop over a ridiculous amount of generators and clutter go get through your schizophrenic design, you're not getting a single cap from me.
---
I just move the custom.ini out of the folder and then back in when I’m done. It’s obnoxious to do daily but it works
---
Its the 1 and 2\* crap that killed it for me.  Each their own, but anymore I just grab a 3\* from Murg each day.  I at least might get something tradeable during the process.  I have gotten a couple SS this way, 3\* of course, but still shit.  rng
---
I still say for the grind we put in just to be able to make a SS piece, they should guarantee you a 3\* roll.
---
Heavy gunners unite!
---
I never got confirmation that it was bugged but there were definitely times that seemed strange to me. I think it’s ok now.
---
They will 100% delay most of the stuff for the next patch. There is NO WAY they will add that much in one update
---
I was able to when it first came out
---
Not even the camp one?
---
Which system? I was probably gonna drop some nukes here in a bit. Fight the queen then skip on over to the weird forest area near by fissure prime. See if i can get wendigo colossus to spawn in.
---
I admit, many, many levels ago I did that to someone.  I had no idea why these dozen players were just standing around.  There were enough players that the event was successful in spite of my premature terminal usage.
---
When I did my encryptid, my husband and I were on a public team.  I was walking him through Lying Lowe, with much narration and direction.  This one dude was following along with us.  Reading terminals, picking up the same items I directed my husband to, etc.  It certainly seemed like he was on the same quest.
---
We get to the ambush site, husband doesn't want to use his recall card, so I use mine.  I gave very clear directions.  "Let the timer run until there's only about a minute left to give the rest of the map time to show up."  Dingle berry activates the terminal IMMEDIATELY.  Even with me standing in the door to the cabin yelling "No!  Get away from that terminal!"
---
A lvl 400+ did save our butts by being all 3 pylons, and 5 or 6 other players did show up to kill robots, so it all worked out in the end.  But there was a minute where I thought about going all PvP on his ass.
---
Have to get in the chassis and put it on manually
---
Hands down the coolest camp I've ever seen.
---
Hmm ya its bugged for me i got it right when it came out as well
---
It's fallout dude, it's supposed to be kinda wacky. If your weapon kills it kills, the rest is up to you. I've been using a food build since beta to kill the best pvpers in the game, because my weapons work. It's not their builds bro, that's an excuse. Get a weapon that works and PvP is done. Survival mode failed because hackers were clearing servers, you probably didn't even load in to see. But bar harel and other hackers were camping spawns with aimbot. It was fun when there were legit players. That's why I use a melee to kill foodbuilds like you, it makes them unable to claim hacks. I'm just running at em with a mole miner gauntlet. My builds not made for that. Still kill people just fine. If you can kill your opponent then balance isn't a factor, it's aim dude.
---
Please define the difference between excuses and reasons.  Or are "excuses" just the "reasons" with which you don't personally agree?
---
Too lazy to fo for one challenge :p
---
Bless your heart.
---
\- Bethesda
---
Great idea, as long as they fix the current display bugs.
---
That's ok no problem, I'll keep looking in there
---
That should of been obvious well before you roll your first piece, I killed SBQ and Colussus in small groups with 0 problems aside from the time it takes, 75% my armor had 0 modifiers. Encryptid is the only hard content in the game unless you want to kill the raid bosses on a private server.
---
What console are you?  Im pc
---
And I still cant be arsed to try NW out.
---
What platform do you play on? I only have 1 right now because I sold the others, but if you're on Xbox and I find another one, you can have it
---
It's awesome that my 1200+ damage gauss shotty cant bring down a level 20 ghoul after unloading a full mag on it.
---
I'm ps4 could possibly have something to do with that
---
I help them, then I kill them.  A level 5 joins my team and comes to my camp, picks a fight and dies to a visitor/shopper, then begs me for 'batteries' for his PA frame for free.  He bought some things, so I comped him one.  After about 5 minutes of trying to get my artillery flares that he took back from him, I got annoyed and removed him from the team and started shooting him.  He ran off outside my base, and shot me with a hunting rifle, so he then got killed.  True story.
---
Can u place ur camp up there?
---
It's not coming soon, but it is something on their radar.
---
It's the drama of the week. Remember the death threats and calls to fire/sue when fasnacht didn't work for a little while? I don't like to generalize but fucking hell, some people here are so out of touch it feels wrong just reading through it all
---
Ahhhh thank you! I was sitting there for ages working out what had gone wrong, now it makes total sense
---
Might, noticed each console has different quirks sometimes
---
I feel ya.
---
Hope you didnt build the generic four room suburban mansion box house on a cliff side then. Negative points if you also have a bar/diner. If I'm going to have to tour a house for 3 machines full of present plans, I dont want to be in the same house as the last 39 camps I visited. I'm sorry that I used a very poor generalization, but camps that are unique enough to actually warrant investigation are growing few and far between. And if your house is one of the few gems out there, I'd tour it regardless of where your machines are.
---
Got up there once, took some pretty delicate parkour shit, and fell all the way down more than once. Was bummed I couldn't place a base but still worth it.
---
Currently trying to get on top of the AMS building in Watoga.
---
No problem lol
---
I regularly kill everyone and every thing so sure, why not.  Maybe after I complete the quest including the countless days of stupid repetitive grind just to get them to like me enough to buy their best shit with a new currency that I might roll 100's of 1\* pieces with and did I mention fuck Rocksy and Ward and taking photos.  I can't wait for the next new content!  Bring it.
---
I didn't even realise we had started the concrete phase, and I play daily to get the score.
---
When did it even start.
---
Let's face facts...Beth is NOT going to delay the BOS dlc. They are also NOT going to piss off the thousands to actual players who made "contributions" of resources. 
---
They will give away some free stuff and the rest will have to be bought with Atims, regardless of the results. Those are my thoughts.
---
The flying away is so annoying. I once chased a 3 star legendary from the edge of the Mire all the way down near Big Bend tunnel.
---
I'd like to see working hot tubs you can rest in like the camp fire.  Just spruce up the above-ground ones which already exist ingame.  Add some water and a nice steam effect along with some pleasant internal illumination.
---
Thank fucking god yesterdays was annoying as hell
---
Dense your chest armor yo...no more explosive or sb sonic attack damage
---
My theory is that it probably had an ulterior motive to get 1st'ers to clean out their Stashboxes just a few weeks before many of the year-long subscriptions come due.
---
Atleast I had stuff to actually get that was new then and tbh it was nice. It's main issue was the legendary loot all sucked
---
I swapped to PA it's clearly the way to go. Just finished my strangler set thanks to the... ah... extra generosity of Smiler at the moment...
---
If you’re on PS4 I would gladly help you get started and answer any questions along the way.
---
Event rewards drop stims. Ironically enough, ghouls also drop Radaway. I farm Whitesprings enough that I have a few hundred Radaway sitting around somewhere at any given time.
---
I moved my shops out of my main camp, im hoping that will discourage the leaving it turned on mostly. They want the shop and shower, thats inside and still accessible, just less so.
---
Thank you King 🙏🏽 I really needed this
---
T65 gang over here taking no damage.
---
Well I use to just have commie collectron gather blood packs use science perk and maxed super duper and you will have more radways and stims you ever need. But yesterday I was walking through whitesprings vendor area and in a suitcase next to legendary scrip machine I found 758 stims in there. So I don’t think I need any for a long time
---
Maybe the plasma caster if u want it could also work for you uses same ammo and does good damage
---
I always wonder how many of the Enclave loving interlopers I see all over this sub have actually played any of the other games they're featured in and know about the atrocities they've committed.  People who've only ever played 4 and maybe 3 love to hate the Brotherhood because they're rude to ghouls meanwhile the Enclave in Fallout 2 exterminated entire tribal and Vault communities. 
---
And by the way, when Steel Dawn comes out you and your Gatling Plas aren't going to do shit because every BOS member will be essential just like the Raiders at Crater and Settlers at Foundation. Until we get mods or offline play anything resembling real player freedom is an unreasonable expectation.
---
Excavator Power Armor with calibrated legs.
---
Cripple all their limbs and they will self destruct. (very good strat  if your a shotgun build and have the enforcer perk. You could also cripple the arms of a sentry bot and they’ll also self destruct)
---
i wanted t65 but it looks kinda dumb also reclaimed ultracite is better well only in one stat and that's ballistic my 955 ballistic
---
We all would but this aspect is literally the only thing keeping people playing. Its a bullshit system but so is the fact that we still participate in it.
---
I keep going back to the Splatoon Splatfest model of simple "Option A or Option B" competition.
---
If you had the same event, but allowed players to *choose* between donating to the BoS or donating to the Enclave, you'd instantly make it a lot more interesting.
---
I dont understand why the NPCs aren't freaking out about a broadcast from a group they've heard nothing about informing them that they will be taking and fortifying a location by force and that they demand resources in order to do it
---
I kinda liked how they showed how Foundation aren't defacto "good guys" even if they paint themselves to be. Yeah, raiders gonna raid but they're way more fleshed out.
---
Same way you look a door. Lockpick cards and enter the "Edit" mode in the build menu.
---
The idea of it is really cool but they should have had it to where we found specific items for them not the usual scrap we have to use to repair our own equipment. I think they should have had us search for items they created like go look for hardened steel or some crap like that and not such a ridiculous amount of it.
---
My fear is that once they see that we didnt make the goal they'll instantly assume it's like Vault 94 can kill the community events entirely
---
70 rolls for a 1* unyeilding? I don't have your patience. I would have quit at ... hmm ... 20 or something.
---
I noticed it when I got hold of a 2nd minigun.
---
Plan was:
---
Have a junkies FFR in 5mm, to mow down the mobs.
---
And a vampires bash (shredder attached) in ultracite 5mm (but carry 0 ultracite 5mm), that I could quickly switch to and use the shredder for close quarters.
---
But having to wait those few seconds for the spinning to slow down completely spoils that idea.
---
I gotta know: what are you doing with *that* much water?
---
O_o
---
As a new player, I spent 15 minutes looking up how to do the emoji after someone helped me.  By the time I found the emoji, they'd already run off and were gone. Made me feel bad.
---
Can’t buy from vendors afaik
---
I have several uncompleted and 1 even has all the mags checked off but no atoms. The others its possible i haven't got them but im not 100%
---
I meant that the picture in the atom store shows literally nothing, so my guess is when you wear it, you go Invisible.
---
This is my first time going through the comments of reddit and I am NOT disappointed any! 😂
---
Yeah...for all their good nature, they're just as ruthless to anyone outside their little community. Mess with them and they'll get you.
---
Mix between adhesive farming, stimpak, radaway or radshield (forget which ones require purified water) and selling the rest
---
Whose idea of fun are we talking about? Bethesda's is making money hand over fist with as little effort as possible. I'm not sure they're aware of any other perspective than that.
---
The banner is at atlas already.
---
Hopefully they'll add another way of doing it sometime soon.
---
For now, i'll just stick to the flamethrower trap method. Yeah, its a waste of screws but I don't need to make any more weapons anyway.
---
I don't think fo76 is a huge money maker
---
Try picking up your camp device in build mode and rotating it
---
2 happens so frequently now that I consider it the norm rather than the exception.
---
There is a very real possibility that a purely melee toon will not get credit in a modern Queen battle because of this.
---
I would suggest taking up some kind of gun as a secondary specialty and make sure to get your hits in while she's in flight at the beginning.  Then, any melee damage you do is just bonus.
---
Is it a high priority now because you were embarrassed by being hit with the fast travel bug on stream during Quakecon?
---
It sure as hell didn't seem like a high priority before then since features no one asked for ie dumbing down of An Ounce of Prevention quest (which you broke!!) was released before the fast travel bug fix.
---
They’ll pull a bungie and make the event worth x5 or whatever to try and make up for their lack of creativity and the lack of putting anything enjoyable in.
---
Nobody will be playing by the time those come out this fall if they keep going they way they are doing things.
---
20% with herbivore mutation
---
Hey im happy to build with u. Ps Id: egroegy. Good to meet you
---
Real question is, what the hell are we meant to do with these shitty fireworks?
---
I'm on Xbox and thanks ill sort you a fixer from my collection.
---
This is probably the worst event I've seen in a game of this sort.
---
There numbers needed are completely disconnected from reality.
---
The rewards are garbage.
---
There's almost nothing in-game to let you know the event is even happening.
---
But worst of all, there's nothing to actually DO.  This isn't an event, it's just a box you give materials.  Why aren't there events springing up all over the map related to this; killing enemies to help secure the arrival, finding caches that can be handed in for credit, repairing communication stations to get new radio messages, recovering rare quest items needed to repair the facility, returning BoS dogtags, etc.
---
You know, an event like basically every other online game does events, even ESO, another Zenimax property.
---
At some point in the game grinding for good gear is all that's left to do.  And grinding RNG is still grinding anyway, it's just a more annoying and less fair form of grinding.
---
You the MVP! It makes so much sense Thankyou!
---
You missed the joke.   There's just not a picture for the beret in the shop when you click it.
---
I’ve seen it in the shop 2 or 3 times since the wastelanders update it comes around some what often
---
Is it while running or sprinting? I have always wondered about this.
---
Nup.
---
Stupid question from someone who had played the game a lot: do you take fall damage with the marsupial serum? If I use that to jump and then jetpack and fall from the absolute peak, will that damage/kill me?
---
I hate when I forget the sarcasm notice....
---
&gt; I wish there was a way to sort by total weight, not just weight per item.
---
I was pulling out my calculator the other night, trying to decide how many items I needed to drop to get below weight. Sooo frustrating.
---
Better yet I'll get the locations of nuke codes from MODUS and nuke the base
---
&gt;I play a melee build so it's getting a bit frustrating, any tips on how to deal with it?
---
Switch to a heavy weapon build during SBQ fight. Absolute no brainier &amp; you're mostly specced out for it anyhow.
---
Every “reward” in this game is garbage
---
I donated 2500 steel and I donated a 1000 concrete yesterday, tried to farm more and I have just over a 100 concrete now, no-way am I going to be able to do more than another 250 if I can even do that before it ends..  
---
I'm not FO1st, but I "had" a load of scrapper kits from quests to use so I was able to scrap and go around the map.
---
I'm right there with you. The absolute worst. No type of enemy has killed me more often in this game.
---
 Either that or mirelurk kings.
---
The solution? Shotguns with a few Shotgunner perks, Enforcer, and Concentrated Fire.
---
As long as I see an ass-tron before it sees me, 1-2 VATS shotgun blasts to the legs will take it out of commission. Do NOT aim for the head or they will almost certainly kill you before you kill them.
---
Nup? What does that mean
---
It's crossed my mind but my main character is already a heavy-based character and I wasn't sure how good the plasma caster would be while not in Power Armor considering its armor penetration only applies while in PA.
---
That's true. Squeezing for all it's worth is a better characterization.
---
They should just let us craft all weapons and armour like this. Want a fixer have to spend so many modules want certain variant some many more modules then maybe have the 2 and 3rd effect random so it's not too op.
---
Did I just do a r/woosh?
---
Actually now that you mention it, I don't know 🤔 Never used it. Running would be a lot better than sprinting though
---
Not really, I haven't grinded materials for the event, I had 4000 steal and only had 500 concrete. Concrete (as well as the next to fail, Cork) is less common to get through normal gameplay and scrapping.
---
Shoot their legs
---
Awesome! Whereabouts would you like to set up? 😎
---
You know it's because F U, microtransactions.
---
At least Treasure Hunter gave legendary drops.
---
"It just makes the fight longer" is indicative of another problem too, which is that the SBQ just doesn't do all that much to justify a 30-minute-long battle.
---
In the air, she cropdusts or fires green Cheerios.
---
On the ground, she swipes with her wings, lunges, and fires green Cheerios.
---
It's basically 4 different attacks, each simple to evade.  The real challenge comes from the quantity and composition of the additional enemies, and depending on the server, sometimes they don't even show up.
---
It also doesn't help that when she does fly, and this is something Thraex\_Exile alludes to, she can behave like the world's most disinterested final boss.  Flying in bizarre circles without a care in the world about who is shooting her.
---
Very possible.
---
One of the BoS wipe repair the SAM events always spawns a legendary and for the life of me I swear those SB’s are stronger, because I can’t take them down before the event finishes, and if you don’t they just zoom off into nowhere!?
---
"anymore"?
---
When was it possible ever?
---
A fantastic write up and exactly the sort of encounter that keeps the game alive, top marks and keep on roaming that wasteland fellow traveller 👍👍
---
Right, I wouldn't mind running. I certainly don't Sprint enough for it to useful. Unless some how it helps when I get re-spawned in nuke zone and have to run back to the fight.
---
Thanks for the helpful links.  
---
I started playing this over the weekend.  I'd previously played a lot of FO4, where I _think_ it was possible to keep leveling until you had all the SPECIAL you could possibly want. 
---
How careful should I be with managing perks and whatnot?
---
Its probably still better than the standard plasma weapons if u dont want to use the flamer barrel
---
I almost wonder if there is something with the disks lol
---
The layers of rng really hurt that treasure hunter event. Then again, considering this event is essentially trading materials for small holiday gifts it's probably the worse of the two
---
If this is right after you make a character and put the pip boy on then you will have to restart.  Happens on occasion unfortunately.  If this is not your problem then I have no clue how to help you.
---
Yes.
---
Looks like the boycott worked (either because people have had it with Bethesda or just saw that the rewards sucked). 
---
We might have still missed the mark anyhow but 4m out of 150m us a statement.
---
Which one is that? Is it different than the scavenger and raider?
---
I'm using an AA lever action rifle since my lvl ~70 (196 atm) yet I barely got 5 bloodied weapons in a month. It just feel like the looting system is biased or bugged at this point. The latter wouldn't surprise me ...
---
Uncommon in normal gameplay is a very different thing than grinding for an event. Shown by my math you already had half the concrete you would’ve needed to do your part for the event.
---
Realistic rewards* don't piss in my mouth and call it lemonade BGS..
---
I usually use that time to take a bathroom break and grab some water lol
---
I mean they are jerks but he is a normal human dude who is trying to help them so I imagine he's gonna get an immediate job even if it's just logistical or janitorial lol
---
Great question but i return to you: shouldnt our location be relevant to style? What kind of settlement? Suburb? Junkie? Warehouses? Damn im excited! :)
---
Edit: spelling
---
Xbox sorry I didn’t respond earlier tornado warning
---
Yea when was this ever a thing?
---
Dailies and weeklies used to offer atoms as the reward up until the score system came out
---
It happens, but for me, it's pretty rare.  I've gotten into the habit of always confirming my nuke placement with Enter, rather than clicking "Confirm" on the map.  It's my belief that there's a bug which causes that click to register *through* the prompt, repositioning the nuke while simultaneously confirming it.
---
I would recommend Aaron holt farm for cranberries. With green thumb I usually get about 16-18 cranberries and only bugs to bother you
---
TBH, i think they need to guarantee a 3 star drop with these armors or weapons. they are non tradeable. And chances are that its going to take you some time
---
Some of the challenges still give decent atoms, but you can only do them once per account
---
There might be a good number you haven't done yet tho
---
Dailies and weeklies used to offer atoms as the reward before score came out
---
that's not "farming" though.
---
Was it his idea to gather resources or did he hear the broadcast and decide to do as they had asked?
---
But regardless of his motivations, the BOS knows that they have issued a demand/ultimatum for supplies and naturally assume that the local serfs..er...populace will be gathering their tribute...er...requested supplies.
---
I know, but sometimes when I go way overboard crafting I'm happy to have the 1* crap so I can get rid of more. Double edged sword that one
---
Why are you trying to drag us to the dark side? You stupid, sexy duper!
---
No. Its all score challenges now. All daily atoms are gone.
---
The Hornwright Estate access keycard is located on the top floor executive level of the Hornwright Industrial headquarters. One can also be found inside the Hornwright summer villa, on a cart in the basement.
---
I heard a work around somewhere and it’s been working, it’s frustrating, but it seems to work. Basically, engage vats, click the button again to disengage vats, and then engage vats again. That should work. I really hope they fix it, gauss rifle never works like it should.
---
So only 146 million to go? Nice!
---
Technically it is. Mundane repeated tasks for a specific reward. Dailies now are farming for score. Score and atoms are interchangeable in a sense
---
Also there is a scrap bench inside the fort. I go in and kill my way up to the 4th floor to scap all the LitS weapons. Get some good exp and a 3* usually as well.
---
"I really hate this limited time system."
---
-- A player who plays the game on a limited basis
---
I had 162 scrap concrete.  LOL.  this was doomed from the start
---
It wouldn't surprise me if the counter magically completed itself.
---
After all, the BOS is stealing our resources. Not saying enclave are good guys but they’ve actually never needed us to donate all of the cork that ever existed
---
I'm sure Bethesda can top it if we just give them a chance :)
---
Pharma karma perk
---
I don’t think we are going to get it.
---
Without sneaking?  Probably not that practical.
---
The closest I've ever gotten to a thematic sci-fi gunner-type setup was with a Bloodied Laser Rifle or Pistol, modded with the Beam Splitter that causes it to behave like one of those "magic" Shotguns.
---
I don't use it that much though, because the "magic" effect is very inconsistent (and it does very little damage without it... and it's not silenced, which only compounds that problem), and it creates those ash piles that screw up respawned enemeis.
---
The ones I haven't done will take months unfortunately. I just hate they they essentially removed the free to play side of the atom shop. As a builder it's sad go see
---
All I care about is the purveyor sale and maybe meat week(never did it before).
---
So long as we can donate enough to keep those im good.
---
Not really. Awhile ago they changed some of the challenges to reward items instead but they did add a few new ones but nothing that seems repeatable or generous. So its pretty much paying for them.
---
Not everyone can play every single day.
---
What a shame!
---
And the players are going to pay for it!  
---
Wait
---
Treasue hunt at least gave us legendarys for scrip. This is the worst hands down.
---
That's so dumb. Imagine if a food bank said "sorry you can only donate a minimum of 25 canned goods"
---
I'd say they are equally forgettable, but at least the Treasure Hunter event offered new plans to earn/buy/sell which were pretty cool.
---
Of course, Treasure Hunter was itself vastly inferior to the Holiday Scorched event that came before it.
---
Mah Flux capaciter is real low if'n it ain't stabled...
---
And doan call me Scott!
---
If this was true, why not just make scrap in stash weigh nothing... then every player could have unlimited scrap and up to 800 pounds of weapons and stuff.
---
No one wants to spend their time adding another grind to the game. People who have enough to donate probably spent hours farming junk and I wouldn't be one to just hand it over for some cosmetic trash.
---
FFS I cant even add all the items from the new progression system to my camp because of the build cap.
---
Just throwing this out there for people who want to donate concrete and don't know about it.
---
You can get a pretty good chunk of it by having a resource gatherer on top of a concrete spot with your C.A.M.P.
---
I know the Poseidon Power Plant has a spot for concrete as well if you don't want to move your own C.A.M.P. to one of those locations.
---
so.. basically youre saying.. its ok to take out your hangups on other players
---
Yea Ik but op is talking abt farming them like you can get a substantial amount on an hour or so
---
what do these platforms look like?
---
Now that I think about it, I probably could get a hold of the guy once my power is back on. But I probably actually won’t. In the end, it’s just a video game moment. But I still want to express my gratitude to that teammate and to the FO76 community. It’s a small thing, but it’s big in the moment. That’s the kind that drives a contented life.
---
Lol It was rigged from the start - Benny FoNV
---
It has been stuck at 4.65m for hours now ... could the tracker be dead?
---
I carry sugar on me for that very reason.  So now I'm over-encumbered and diabetic.
---
Also having an issue with a surprising drop in damage from my Brotherhood Recon Rifle in particular but thought maybe it was just me. I'm still early in the game but I have 3 Rifleman and 3 Tank Killer and I'm having better luck with a lower level Handmade than the rifle. Still having issues with my shotgun as well with the health bar rebounding. It's been "fun".
---
It's the worst &amp; it brings to stark contrast what is fundamentally wrong with Bethesda ie lazy content that hasn't been tested or thought out &amp; that they don't play their own game.
---
My bet is it’ll be same way they are now for instanced interiors. Which only teammates are allowed in with you right?
---
😆
---
If everyone is doing it I can see that being a pretty fun way to get the message across.you don't even lose caps If you die this way.
---
This! The scouting around using VATS is incredibly helpful.
---
\*looks at all the nukes fired at the raiders\*.................i can give you a soft no. (yes i'm joking too)
---
ATLAS can kiss my puckered starfish! At least the treasure hunter event had some new cosmetic and camp plans that were worth grinding for (Croc backpack, circus trailer, etc)
---
Good lord ppl love downvoting everything they can get ahold of, yet can’t answer a goddam question.
---
The answer is no, there is no longer a way to get atoms easily. The legendary run is supposed to offer us exclusive items that would be worth more than the amount of atoms we normally could get but at the cost of us not getting to choose. You can still get a pretty good amount for playing through, but probably only a couple weeks worth when compared to the old way of getting atoms.
---
thats allright better to be safe then sorry. Im on pc so unfortunately we can’t play together. Wish i knew of some discord for you.
---
It was a way to make money. They could have just made scrap weigh nothing and all the scrap we keep in the scrap box could’ve stayed in the stash box.
---
Oh good. Another one of these posts. 
---
If this type of “protesting” didn’t do anything when FO1st came out what makes you think it’s going to have any different outcome now?
---
So it’s an actual legendary modifier? I can’t recall ever rolling it on armor?
---
Damn that’s lucky, I normally leave pets alone I don’t even milk Brahmin, but I dunno if I would have been able to beat the temptation to see if he was packing a bloodied fixer.
---
Ha ha thay will because it wont even be ready yet
---
Very weird flexing. If no one did this then this exploit would be of no consequence, don't you see the irony in your actions?
---
Maybe the people who assembled Eyebots were big drinkers of NukaCola and while building them used the Eyebot chassis as a bottle opener and just never cleaned up after themselves.  Just a theory...
---
Also maybe run a script that checks data on collection every 15 minutes and updates the results. I’d say actively or in game but setting the bar low these days.
---
Its stuck I think, I've been checking every few hours since yesterday.
---
I hacked a terminal and requested meds, got a bunch of stimpacks that I didn't need, kinda waste to burn them in the fire lol.
---
Their cork defenses will be too powerful
---
Oof! I didn't even think about that 😅 hmm, a warehouse type of settlement would be kickass. Haven't seen one yet, as most people do the suburb thing.
---
Also, I may have added you. There were 3 different names, haha. I'm off for the night cos I have work in the AM, but I'll be on tomorrow 😎👍
---
Go farm your SCORE free atoms, roughly an 80% drop in no-cost-besides-your-free-time atoms, and be thankful!
---
If you are also bitter about this, join the club!  I’ve never asked for a refund on anything but now if I am at all disappointed you can bet I’m putting in my ticket, like I probably should have on a misclick when I brought the mountain trapper outfit.
---
Touché
---
They’re usually out for a week at a time every month or so. If you play enough to afford the item, you play enough to watch for the bundle
---
We are in diff time zones but itll happen friend. Soon enough. I may be on in your morning! Lol
---
has the bos beret eveb come out yet? or is it coming out with next atomic update?
---
That was such a funny time lol
---
In before the wasteland is overrun by mannequins decked out in top tier armor, wandering around picking fights because their code bugged out. [Would be pretty funny to see though]
---
Engage in combat - KILL !
---
I’m guessing it’s an order-of-operations/timing thing. 
---
Because the nuke would kill the Imposter too. 
---
Ending the event. And ending the “safe death event” mode.
---
Do you happen to be on ps4?
---
...and give the Aunt Jemima treatment!
---
Well, all of the energy-based weapon builds I saw on Youtube for things like this were prior to the energy weapons getting to benefit from armor penetration so I wasn't sure whether or not it was enough to make them useful.
---
Using a ballistic weapon just feels so not-Sci-Fi.  :(
---
Ya I've had nothing but luck with the SS armor, I have a full set of cavalier assassin and unyielding with mixed agi, sneak, and sen armors. RNGesus I think has been blessing me since I ran a full year PVPing in the most shit sentinel assassin set.
---
Mine would be *legendary* trash robots - the Mr. Handies, Liberators, Protectrons and their ilk.
---
Because, for some reason, these mooks get the legendary robot explosion despite going down in one hit.  You might not even see the star.
---
So you're screaming through a map one-shotting everything, pause a second to loot, and get gibbed by an irrelevant enemy who would never have damaged you anyway *and whom you already killed*.
---
Just such an inglorious and frustrating way to go.
---
fast travel bug AND the respawn bug. respawn bug makes me force quit and lose everything, so its way more frustrating to me.
---
What other perks? i have a 2 star bloodied 50 limb damage
---
I generally find it to be about 1/3 ionized meat, and the other 2/3 split pretty evenly in stabilizing materials. Ionized meat is pretty awesome, in that it doesn't spoil, has a pretty decent value (4-10 caps depending on charisma), and works well for irradiating oneself.
---
But that player does have to spend mat's repairing the base and time dealing with a griefer. Cause irrelevant to what meaning you wanna put behind it, it's still griefing
---
Upvoting for generosity
---
I wouldnt be too worried if I were you, they would have seen you were low level and probably not known of the emojis existance. Took me till I reached lvl 15 to see it
---
Yeah, I'd rather not use the flamer.  It's not that I don't like flamers, I just have a particular idea on what I want the character to be and I wanted a pew pew laser type gun.
---
I guess we'll see!
---
The beret is available in the atom store as a free item 😄
---
I started an alt when we had the double xp weekend and have been having a lot of fun with it. I got a couple really good unarmed melee weapons for on my main account so I dropped them to my secondary for a sneak unarmed build, it’s almost like playing a different game when you use a whole new build. Also dropping yourself weapons and armor to get ahead as a low level player from your main account makes the beginning super smooth. I was going to scorched earth as a level 5 and just tagging all the mobs and would level up 3 times during one event lol, now my alt is level 160 and I play that build mostly because I love the melee builds
---
Yes, this is the worst. At least with treasure hunters you could murder mole miners for xp, and get legendary drops. This event should have had at least a treasure hunters aspect, like you'd find a legendary super mutant that dropped 1k, 2k, or 5k of concrete or whatever. So there was a chance at a decent reward and some way to farm horseshit materials like concrete and cork.
---
I'm guessing you're American? If so, you're probably around 6 or 7 hrs behind me. I'm from Cape Town, South Africa.
---
Does thus technically mean the bos won't come? If so im glad we failed. I would rather see the enclave or something more towards all of us being in a faction.
---
Quite possibly, but in this game everyone is running all the time. When do you ever see people sauntering about and not running and hopping about all over the place.
---
I installed a mod from the nexus for Fallout 4 and it actually works, oddly enough at least I don't think it is a placebo.😊
---
Indeed. Nonetheless on Fri/Sat i play all night long so looking forward to meeting eventually!
---
Large, flat, 4 story tall platforms for the SBQ to land on. Generally a staircase going up to huge empty deck. Built near fissure site prime so a nuke can hit the fissure, but leaves the platform radiation free
---
A wonderful idea, they could even make a separate map for the Appalachian underground with its own map icons. Perhaps a friendly moleman city to explore. There are a ton of possibilities, great idea!
---
The other rewards r decent
---
This is my favorite camp ever. Are you on Xbox?
---
Better way to spend resources than donating them to todd
---
Confused how easily it seems steel went and there's barely a dent in this round
---
... 🤔
---
You can get 2000 from the legendary run over 10 weeks. You could not get 10,000 in 10 weeks before. May want to check your math. 
---
Anyway the overall point you are making about there being much less atoms is correct!
---
Oh heck yeah. My favorite, very hard to come by, pieces are Unyielding\Sentinel\whatever combat, AP would be god roll but I've never got one of those. As far as SS I've had one Unyielding torso and maybe two Sentinels but never on the same piece
---
I am! GT is HeroKunning!
---
Dense armor only negate 50% fire damage, right?
---
Yeah I have the beam splitter on the Plasma Gun right now, trying it out.  
---
I know that if I put the Beam Splitter and a stock on the Plasma Gun, it becomes a rifle and gets bonuses from the rifle damage cards.
---
Do you know if it ALSO gets damage bonuses from shotgun perk cards?
---
This will be the first time in 1600 hours I may actually load up NW.
---
 I think you're the third person to suggest that exact location now. Which is the issue, everyone knows about it, everyone will go to it, and everyone will kill each other to have it and as the killing is going on, no concrete is being extracted.
---
Plus new players or people under level 50 will be crushed by all the high level players.
---
Bruh just get in the atom shop lol
---
Come one dude! We all love the world of Fallout and all the stories, factions, characters and places that are in it.
---
I myself have never played Fallouts 1,2 or 3. I have played Vegas, 4 and 76. But i have watched many Fallout videos and read the fallout wiki many times. Yes we know that the Enclave are not very "Good". They are baddies and we love em, they are iconic and they look amazing. Their tech is very advanced and their gear, guns and power armors look amazing.
---
Also some people just like the bad guys and evil factions in fiction. There is nothing wrong with that or in roleplaying as them.
---
I dont get damaged at all
---
If he pops a radaway does that kill the mutation?   That would suck for the kid if he losses it within an hour.
---
Yes but that's only if we get the quota filled lol
---
They're idiots
---
You’ll get this banner somehow.  Bethesda didn’t make an art asset to just throw it away like mailboxes, Corvega medium water purifier, or Cait’s outfit!
---
Yeah I mean you're not really protesting, you're just being an asshole because you want to be an asshole
---
My magic shotgun rocks in vats.
---
Damn....I wish I bought the jet back earlier ago
---
You think they just make that asset and not sell it
---
You want my hard earned concrete that I'm definitely never going to use all of just for some banner? You bring shame unto your family
---
I managed to donate like 750 Concrete (I had stocked up on it because I had farmed it before). The results were disappointing. If I had made bulk stuff and sold it, it would‘ve been worth more than the rewards. It would be much better if we could get Gold Bullion or Caps.
---
Or even better idea,  not give them to Todd and not have to repair your camp cause someone thought it'd be funny to level your camp...
---
Ah well I sadly dont have the atoms if they do make it available in the atomic shop
---
That was my next question.
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
Come to the dark side! We don’t have cookies, but we have perfect rolls ss armor without years of frustration and having to get on every single day to grind 😂 
---
For reals though. In my defense, I don’t sell for money. I don’t dupe to trade. I dupe because I am frustrated that good things are impossible to get with how horrible the RNG is, and how absurd trading gets. I don’t pvp. I don’t have millions of godrolls or junk or consumables. I just want to enjoy the game and not get shafted with lame gear, or have to do thousands of trades to make a 1* nocturnal pipe turn into a a good piece of armor. 
---
I love fallout games. With 76 though, it really feels like they try to bone their playerbase and it makes me incredibly sad. Anything that hurts players is around for years, things in players favor gets patched immediately. I still play to hang with friends. It’s just very discouraging to see my favorite developer turn into this.
---
Buy the pulse capacitor from secret service, and use a flamer barrel. Captain newb made a video, it works awesome, and its not a flamer  haha
---
As do you, stranger. I want that banner, I may not have a lot of concrete but I was only able to donate 250. So at least I'm helping to get something I really want
---
Well it's good to hear at least someone is getting lucky, I'm sure not. I did however roll a B33 Gauss shotgun first try, so I quit immediately with those. Now if I could learn to use the thing properly is another matter
---
OP doesn't really understand the concept of farming.
---
You know. I did NW just for that. Got on a team and the 3 other people had played together and were really friendly
---
I know lol. I just dont have any atoms to buy it, and I dont have the money to but atoms sadly
---
h-how tf, i havent seen it, wtf
---
Sorry but pvp is not fun in this game nor is it properly balanced, and the game is poorly optimized aside from all that. Also i don't know how blueprinting entire workshops has anything to do with PVP  esp when you can't blueprint traps or turrets in my idea. Also never said we should take PVP out as part of my idea. Some person started this conversation because i guess they enjoy griefing low level players while they are in the middle of building.
---
Remember this conversation is just about one person objecting to the idea because they can't grief players who are in the middle of building and can't fight back. So somehow this person thinks that's unfair that they can't have an unfair advantage in combat where a player takes time a lot of time to react in a buggy laggy menu where that they need to exit before they get a chance to fight back.
---
Didn't even say that pvp should be disabled or anything for my idea, i just don't think it's well designed or worth engaging in outside of nuclear winter.
---
I hope that works! I’ll try this afternoon.
---
You can get a lot of cloth from Wavy Willards by collecting paper cups and hot dog/pizza trays.
---
Np
---
25% if you do public teams and have strange in numbers I think its called.
---
I've been playing for a month and spent most of it living off of those cranberrys and haunting building teams.  Hit level 119 yesterday.
---
Weird I got it today...check the free tab see if its popped up
---
CAMP tool deployment in NW works the same way as in Adventure Mode. Hit the inventory button and the move option will be shown in the options at the lower portion of the UI. In NW there is no cost to CAMPing. You can drop it in multiple locations from the same standing location in an arc around you when needed for the daily SCORE challenge.
---
Oh it's updated lol just no one donating anything!
---
This just shows how much bethesda know about their own game's economy...
---
If you don’t mind the horrible performance and the massive amount of bugs, get it
---
Sadly not, Xbox here. I never accounted for different communities having different building styles. My apologies. On a side note, 95% of the contractors on this conole are boring :(.
---
I’ve seen this in the shop several times over the last few months. It’s popular.
---
If you've done the first main quest far enough, just go into the asylum to use the Brotherhood's workbenches. It's easy to walk that far.
---
Obviously OP knew it was available at some point, and couldn't know that without also knowing it was a limited time item.
---
This is what I'm after  📷**Hornwright Estate lab key**  
---
W05\_MQS\_201P\_HornwrightEstateLabKeycard
---
I agree that would have been a better way to do it. Much more doable for us non fallout 1st users that have to fight with stash space regularly. This event seemed too focus around fallout 1st users and trying to get more people to purchase fallout 1st
---
Oh... man, that's unfortuante!
---
Oh hell yeah and I would pvp ever enclave that tried
---
Based on the Quakecon stream, it was painful to see that CM and developers obviously don't play the game that much now.
---
The NL Q &amp; A stream the devs stated that it is mandatory for devs to play the game at least once per week....not really a flattering comment.
---
Shame, don't get me wrong I love the game, shit-show as it is.
---
I always send them a message letting them know if they want to keep it they have to put on that perk and has to be maxed
---
Did not know that, looks like I'm exploring later today
---
“Balance”
---
yeah you should.
---
:( well my base is an inclosed settlement. Picture covenant in fo4 but as a raider/junkyard vibe
---
If you have played Fallout before and liked it, yes. Honestly if you like RPGs or shooters, yes. If you usually don’t play any of these, it’s really up to how you like it when you play it.
---
Are you one of those griefers that keeps their camp hidden on the map so others can’t destroy it?
---
This dude really just said epic fail
---
100% agree. Especially with the first sentence lol
---
Now the next issue will he is it a free for all for kids or only ones they allow
---
Weapon loading speed bonus by holding them in your hand ;)
---
Played a little fallout 4 and loved it alot on PC atleast
---
I hope we fail to collect both the concrete and cork as a means of giving this whole concept a giant bird.
---
I get people are into the BOS and all but, lore-wise for long-time players of the franchise ...HELP FORTIFY THE BEGINNINGS OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF STEEL, ARE YOU FKN KIDDING ME?! FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK those guys.
---
Personal faction feelings aside, I kind of feel like this is the community banding together on yet another poorly designed and haphazardly executed event to say "lol, no."
---
I donated 250
---
Yeah I've seen that, it's good for now untill they patch it I guess.
---
This reads like an insult when it's really not. The business model is intended to prey on your fear of missing out. It's a shit flavor of the week practice, and it'll always be remembered as such--right up there with loot boxes and pay to win. Not playing every day and being frugal with atoms is a lot smarter.
---
Lemmiwinks the molerat is about to go on a grand adventure.
---
It's not really expensive even if you play through half the main story and a few events and decide you dont like it it isnt like you're out much
---
I know that there has been very little progress, but the OP is wrong about the reason. People aren't donating because ***there is nothing to donate.***  I have hopped all around the map to the usual spots where I have farmed concrete previously. And they have all been picked clean.  I don't think that there is enough concrete on the map to meet this goal.  With steel, you could scrap enemy weapons and smelt iron ore.  Concrete is a junk item that is part of the shared world.  If you are in a server where someone else has looted all of it, that means you can't loot it and you can't donate it.
---
It's a fun games but the devs really let you down and there are new bugs in every update. Although if you dont have bad wifi it can be quite fun. But you have to get through the bugs and sometimes lag issues. A d the community is awesome. Normally...
---
Good lad, sadly our efforts are futile. We will sadly have to pay atoms to get the banner ;-;
---
Oh yeah. All that and popping a brain fungus, berry mentat just before mass murdering a swarm of anything. Mmmmmmmm. Delicious exp.
---
Ok thanks
---
Do you like exploring an open world game?
---
Do you like the combat mechanics of fallout 4? 
---
Do you like grinding and Crafting/ modding gear as you improve your character over time?
---
Are you patient when playing games?
---
Do you like fallout and fallout lore?
---
If you answered yes to these, you may enjoy the game. 
---
——————————————-
---
Now for another set of questions:
---
Do you get frustrated easily if you find an area too challenging in a video game. 
---
Do you like to rush through missions, without taking time to read notes, pay attention to environmental story telling?
---
Do you get frustrated with even the most simple of bugs?
---
Do you have zero tolerance for any lag in a game and are you expecting top tier graphics all the time?
---
If you answered yes to these, you may not like the game. 
---
One final note: the game is a lot of fun solo but I do think it can really shine when you find a good group to go around with.
---
ohhhhh, i havent gotten on today, i tried to check but the atomic shop wouldnt load in, so i gave up, thank you
---
Watchout, the brotherhood has a strict HOA and might just come over and level it.
---
Seen these statment mulltiple times, it seems rng broken as f and it indeed uses some server side info for rng calculations....
---
That realy bad if so...
---
Do you enjoy the Fallout Universe?  Do you enjoy playing in a multiplayer game where you can either solo (most of) the content or team up sometimes?
---
Can you endure some glitches and bugs that, to be honest, usually aren’t too bad but still shouldn’t be in the game?
---
If you answers yes, then you should try it out. What platform are you on?
---
Doubt it will be more than a 300.
---
I too have only played Fallout 4 (a little of NV) and now this is my favorite game at the moment. Despite its many issues, I always want to play everyday I can.
---
Nice. I did mine as a tent/awning market camp. It is definitely well developed, but as a trading post, we accept all kinds...unless you have green crystalline growths.
---
Seriously. I use to want to complete every Daily challenge for the Legendary Run, but leveling up at Level 135 was taking up too much time, trying to find certain legendary enemies...forget about it, and sitting around waiting for NW to load and then getting killed right off the bat before I can kill creatures, use stims, etc. got too annoying. Now I complete as much as I can and log off. I wish I had more time (and patience) but I don't lol
---
I do enjoy doing that, and I enjoy my blueprinted turret traps for food builds. Don't apologize to me my dude, apologize to yourself for being foodbuild fodder. Taking scrap and salt from folks like you keeps me playing. I prefer killing higher level players because usually they have junk in their inventory and get mad when I take it, after I'm done griefing them i just add their junk to my stash. Not like I need it but like, raider life yo
---
Yeah, then it's moot since it often takes longer than 4 seconds to reload.
---
Answered yes to the first half, I like taking my time, if an area is hard it's fun cause I get to improve my character to a point where I'm proud of and over come the challenge
---
Why do people still do this?
---
My unyielding build requires unyielding on each piece. Minimum. I'm in the same boat as op, only rolling on the chest first. I'm at 36 rolls, and have gotten nothing usable. 
---
The fact I cant trade the item I make nor can I break it down to reuse the module are huge pain points for me. Every day I login, get my 3 modules roll crap and log off.
---
Unless you've been a serious hoarder &amp; have 1st, that's about one person can contribute. Twice maybe. All the while steel is just falling into your lap without doing much.
---
Just saying, it's not necessarily people not caring but not being able to do anything.
---
In hoping they will be 100 or less, I only have 60 atoms
---
I have seen it alleged that it's failing because people refuse to donate.  I don't think that's true.  People aren't donating because ***there is nothing to donate.*** I have hopped all around the map to the usual spots where I have farmed concrete previously. And they have all been picked clean. I don't think that there is enough concrete on the map to meet this goal. With steel, you could scrap enemy weapons and smelt iron ore. Concrete is a junk item that is part of the shared world. If you are in a server where someone else has looted all of it, that means you can't loot it and yourself and can't donate it.  This event is further proof that Bethesda doesn't play their own game.  There is not enough concrete in the world to meet this goal.
---
Agree, all the tedious bullshit is annoying. I was never in the “camp” of complaint about not having enough content (except story missions and side quests) as this game already had limits and daily quests. Now it’s run rampant with only Wastelanders providing side/main quest. Every other dlc has been short or no questline to begin with. But they’ve all had grindfest down-pat.
---
What’s going to be hard for me is cork. That’s next
---
Are you joking?
---
There's been a thread about this for near a week, and I've been tagging you in it.
---
This can't be the first time this has been brought up.
---
I unexpectedly collected over 1200 steel from a single 'Line in the Sand". Walked all the way from the tunnel entrance to Atlas. Like a man.
---
Pretty sure Bethesda can view what we have regardless of donations.  After all the game is saved on their servers.
---
As a walled off community we have to open the door for you unless you're a mutated freak and can jump over our fences
---
Spoiler alert, they always were.
---
It's shit they have to make it mandatory. Devs should wanna play and explore their games. I know you can get burnt out making event's and story and developing games which is normal and A-ok, but if that is the norm then you need to look at why you don't wanna participate is something you're building/creating.
---
True but most of my friends are FO1st mems
---
now. Here need 10 mags have 9 checked off but it says I pnl6have 8 collected
---
I think concrete is a daunting ask on their part. Steel is easy because you can get thousands per play session with the scrapper perk. I had to play for 8 hours over the weekend to get 250 concrete once because I also had to make sure I got my daily score...
---
Thats brutal- I sure wish I could share- I have had tremendous luck with my ss unyielding pieces- probably sitting on 15 unused 2-3\* just need that one right arm wwr and I will finally be complete.  May RNGesus bless you
---
This. The enforcer perk, concentrated fire perk and any shot gun. Cripple both legs and the head and the assaultron will just crawl around. Cripple its arms too and BAM self destruct.
---
Also works great on the arms of a sentry bot. Cripple both arms and BAM self destruct.
---
PS4 and so far you people are convincing me, and I have only played a little of fallout 4 loved it from what I played, really liked dog meat
---
Do a few challenges. Why do you want this so much lol it's just a stick
---
I've seen a equal number of nukes tossed on foundation haha. Wish something cool happened besides the fast armor changes.
---
It's one guy
---
I can't see myself missing that being there, since I usually spend 20-30 mins down there making SS armor every day. Its definitely not always been there since there was a series of posts asking for one \~2 months ago and nothing since on here or patch notes.
---
Awesome I'm probably going to purchase it, it isn't too expensive
---
Then perhaps you should point it out to them instead of generalizing.
---
Cause it looks dope as fuck! But I really want the collectron, so I'm hoping everyone donates for that at least
---
"Flamer barrel."
---
"Not a flamer."
---
\-Narrows eyes.-
---
Personally I see it as a season 2 score reward.  Adding it to the atom shop for atoms looks sleazy after making a frankly unattainable goal, and giving it away for free is an admission of their own lack of understanding of their own game.  Throwing it into S2 works, and allows them to pad the scoreboard without doing more work.
---
You playin now?
---
If so,what’s yer lvl?
---
I can craft ya some starter gear &amp; possibly a weapon wit some ammo depending on what build yer gonna go for....
---
I could probably throw ya a few stim packs &amp; radaway as well.
---
It really bums me out that every time I'm thinking about trying to play this game again, I just come here and see everyone upset with Bethesda over something new.
---
Just make sure the team autofill is turned off. That way you'll be on your own without screwing over the three other people that would have been on your team.
---
Your guess is as good as mine.
---
I think the worst insult I could give this event is that I've seen better event's on a Fallout Gmod server.
---
Heck I've made better event's on a Gmod server.
---
... It was, very dark times.
---
Rad!
---
I think my new end game will be stalking and killing Brotherhood patrols.
---
The problem isn't with people not donating. The problem is that ***there is nothing to donate.*** I have hopped all around the map to the usual spots where I have farmed concrete previously. And they have all been picked clean. I don't think that there is enough concrete on the map to meet this goal. With steel, you could scrap enemy weapons and smelt iron ore. Concrete is a junk item that is part of the shared world. If you are in a server where someone else has looted all of it, that means you can't loot it   yourself and can't donate it. This event is further proof that Bethesda doesn't play their own game. There is not enough concrete in the world to meet this goal.
---
&gt;It is a shame that some people in the community dont care about everyone, rather they just care about themselves and what items they want to get from this community event. If you could open your heart and expand your knowledge and open your eyes, you can see there are others who exist besides you not wanting to donate concrete for a banner.
---
That's charming dude. You blame the players for what is entirety a Bethesda problem. Clearly untested, poorly thought out, poorly rewarded but it's the players fault for not thinking about how other players might feel.
---
Maybe it's your fault for not trying hard enough to collect concrete. Of course I'm not serious but see how dumb that sounds? That how you sound right now. 
---
You're the worst of the community - a blind sycophant who blames players over the real culprit, Bethesda.
---
I think today's number is so embarrassing considering it's now been a whole weekend, they don't want to update.
---
Might be that they are out of your "effective range" of your weapon for example with my black powder rifle there is some point where it goes down to 70 dmg from \~1.7-5k
---
I try to keep up with all the tags but sometimes I miss some. I am human. Also if you tag me in the body of a post I don't get a notification for it so sometimes I'll miss those.
---
Yea I really want to get back into the game. I had a level 11, but I just wanted to restart for fun and to see what's new in the last years, so I'm level 2 or 3 now. That would be really cool, but you dont have to make me anything if you dont want to.
---
Edit: I dont really know builds in this game, I havent bothered to look any up, I probably should.
---
I wonder if bethesda is like... we fucked up. Seeing it expires tomorrow and we are at like 4.5 million. Out of 150m
---
The best advice I can give is dilute stimpaks until you’ve got about 30 spare!
---
if you want to take a more passive approach then what others have suggested, Get some power armor or high Damaged resistances and casually play the game. As long as you dont take much damage you will build up stimpacks fairly quick, and you dont have to specifically go out of your way to farm them. Good luck!
---
First game it looks fine, it just doesn't translate well to the 'modern' engine and would look awkward outside most camps
---
I fisted the grafton monster in nw..
---
Enclave &gt; BoS.
---
That is all
---
It’s definitely still the same about of scrip no matter how you slice it
---
I don't even see anything about this in the game other than a banner when waiting to join a server. How do you even do this? They sure aren't doing a good job bringing this to people's attention.
---
Leave my genetic status as a mystery, I have a jetpack.
---
Good job I tagged you in the comments then isn't it?
---
I know of crippling but she does a stagger animation when hit enough with the respective perks from what I have seen, do you have any source for the stagger claim?
---
Those cheaters protests by cancelling Fallout 1st probably did work. A bunch of them got their accounts back, not wiped, and placed on a final warning.
---
Ghouls of any kind. The numbers, the sounds, the marathon sprints, the phantom's leap, the invisibility, the invincibility, and their faces...
---
ah thank you i will try that. Actually seems that clicking confirm might  have something to do with it.
---
yes the lack of new plans is the killing blow. If they put in a few with a 10% drop chance and rotated for each different material people would go nuts for all of the grinding.
---
I also hope they'll be fixed but some weapons will need buffs in my opinion, especially shotguns.
---
There’s ten bags at the top of the monorail elevator, along with a gnome, baseballs and golf balls
---
You are complaining about being able to craft a armor set that completely unbalances the gear meta where it has the best defense stats in every single section possible and a jet pack to boot.
---
Let that sink in.
---
This is your endgame game breaking set, this isn't something you should be able to earn immediately unlike the rest of duped gear floating around. It should be a grind to craft and a grind to earn the ultimate rolls to break the game even further.
---
Get the small backpack plans in Morgantown airport terminal, entrance is on the lower west side. 
---
To get the regular backpack you'll need to do the scout quest, you can start that to the east of the airport, north of the lake at the dam. 
---
For that you'll need 2 things
---
Search this sub for the answers to the exams. 
---
A camera. 
---
To get the camera, get the free computer terminal in the atom shop, build it in your camp and look up the "suspicious person quest" in it. You don't have to do that quest (other than to repair it), just get the broken camera off the "tourist"  note, this is a Pro snap DELUXE, not just a regular Pro snap.
---
Watch captain newbs video then get back to me...
---
Morgantown is one of the most underrated nuke zones, A buddy of mine and I did a morgantown nuke once and got cobalt for days.
---
PSA: Workshops can be taken with pvp!  Join a public team to get to their workshop and you've done two!  I know, hacks.
---
7 gnomes in a Huntersville
---
Captainoob
---
Love it!!!
---
Good points. The event could've done with a bit of meat on it. Now it's looking like the basic rewards may not even unlock either.
---
A few rewards from the boxes like simple skins you mention would've been a nice addition. A couple of gun skins for energy weapons for good measure. A BoS ornamental piece to add to the already sparce CAMP decoration or maybe a BoS workbench reskin. This would've made a big difference.
---
Some historical BoS piece like recon armour maybe, would be a great reward in-game.
---
They’ve really outdone themselves this time. I didn’t think it could get any worse after the treasure hunter event, but they’ve proved me wrong.
---
How exactly is it bullshit? I linked a picture my guy
---
yeah I did start branching my build out to rifles and have been trying desperately to unlock the fixer, so it should be fixed in due time but I just think it's sad that player behavior can make three weapon types non-viable in some cases.
---
What system are you on. I have 100 of each I can give you. I do events all the time and get stims/radaway constantly.
---
I say treasure hunter, it was aimlessly wandering the Ash Heap hoping to find a mole miner. At least with Fortifying Atlas we know where to go and the crate will always be there.
---
Here's my tip for you as a new player go here and plan out a build it will save you a headache later on: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Also remember you don't have to pick a Perk Card associated with the Special stat you increased when you Level up you can for example Increase your Strength but pick a Luck Perk Card.
---
If you ever make a "mistake" while leveling up and working on your build don't worry about it once you get past Lv.50 the game gives you a choice between gaining a new Perk Card or relocating a SPECIAL stat point each time you level up so you will always have the opportunity to "fix" your build.
---
Oh, those. Even then, still a completely different sound.
---
On the stage in Watoga high school there are some bird props that I haven't seen elsewhere. Had one birb proudly on display for a while now and am yet to see it pop up in a museum camp
---
I use charging. It has a bug where the arcs always do full charge damage, so you don’t have to charge.
---
100% agree. I still join full servers constantly, and we clear other events just fine. Concrete is simply too hard to get, it's as simple as that.
---
Sure, some might be fed up, but quite a lot got 1st despite all the flaws, and I don't think they'll drop it unless something major game breaking stuff happens, like everyone crashing constantly etc.
---
I believe that’s correct, but obviously, my int 30 character can’t confirm.
---
they respawn after you loot so many items.
---
Again, I'm only human here.
---
It's kind of sad if I really have to do that in my opinion and well I use unarmed so I'd also have to remove non damage perks for the heavy gunner ones, I already have rifles as a secondary now though so it should get easier as soon as I get a decent rifle. Thanks for the suggestion though!
---
Make it a 100 or 250! I would pay!
---
Yeah but I want to camp on cranberries:)
---
The problem isn’t the concrete at all, it’s what comes after hitting the “donate” button. No reward = no participation.
---
And respawns for in world items has nothing to do with a refresh time. Respawns are based on number of items picked up. It’s been a while since I’ve seen it posted but I believe it is around 150-200 world items to start respawning items.
---
Is it not a no build zine?
---
Hey it's the guy
---
I have never actually seen this but it sounds like something hardcore grinders would do so it's not unbelievable, that kind of behavior may get annoying if it takes over as it would mean a lot of servers on cooldowns
---
i had stored all my junk and it said to press A to gather on the screen
---
Wow, you're an asshole aren't you?
---
If I remember correctly from what I read it has to be weapons that are around 200 fire rate. I don’t believe a FFR Fixer is that high of a fire rate.
---
I can't really speak to the FOMO element. I'm not susceptible to it.
---
\^ this
---
You should have Fuzzy Brenda move in. Give her time to clean up, sober up and put her life towards something more productive (with more hygiene involved and less disturbing).
---
Nope this
---
Treasure hunter at least were legendaries
---
What's the auto complete bug? I may have gotten it and not noticed, like with the fast travel one
---
It’s not a 24 hour wait, it’s your personal 180 item loot counter PLUS being on a server where that has not been looted.  It’s much worse than you even think!  
---
A true coordinated effort of farming private servers wouldn’t even help though.  It’s nearly an order of magnitude higher than a realistic goal. As it cork, plastic...  perhaps.   Of all the requested items I only felt steel was a slam dunk.  The others I would not be surprised at all if we fail.
---
Not even awesome cosmetics in the supply crates you get would get us to make this goal.  As I’ve said many times, it’s just proof the devs don’t even play the game if anyone thought that number was realistic.
---
Same here.  I have over a quarter million steel amongst all my alts. Went to town and got a bunch of kits. Sold the alcohol, dumped the grenades, and got a couple of plans. Not worth a scarce resource like concrete.  I barely have 10K concrete in total.  Donated 2K but I still have a lot of building to do, so I did my meager part.
---
Mine aren't right where you spawn but definitely visible from the spawn point with the vault boy pointing at them \^\^
---
I've downed a scorchbeast in 1 clip of a 10mm auto pistol. Nowt magic about it.
---
🙀
---
Nothing like half a house to serve as a halfway house!
---
Or every resource location is listed on this map and you could build your C.A.M.P. on one to extract the resource. 
---
But still, it’s a shitty event.
---
I can def hook ya up,while scavving is “the name of the game”,&amp; I don’t wanna ruin the game,
---
I always wish someone had gave me a leg up early on.
---
As for builds,there’s tons of em,being meta or food,or building/QOL.
---
I mainly just need to know wether ya where gonna go rifle or pistol essentially.
---
GT:Kung Fu Magik
---
I should be on for a bit longer
---
&gt;"So how do we implement these double-sided walls?"
---
&gt;"Atomic Shop."
---
&gt;"Of course, brilliant."
---
Let what sink? in I don’t care about the “gear meta” I believe that at almost 700 hours I should be an absolute beast lol. If you have a problem with me and other people pointing out issues then stay of this sub.
---
You gotta be careful man, the V.P of Bethesda . Ohhh he gonna get ya
---
Concrete is so terrible to grind for that after my first couple hours I shrugged my shoulders and washed my hands of this portion of the event.
---
Even without the Scrapper perk, it was much easier to grind for steel because everything has it.
---
Today I decided to check my scrap box because I thought I would at least have 250 to donate (one time)....I had 150 lol and I scrap everything.....so I guess I won’t be donating.  No time to run around scrounging for it
---
Lucky (and unlucky) for us there’s no possible way they’ll get that much cork.
---
200 years later as well :O
---
Honestly, I wouldn't blame you if the whole team just stopped reading this reddit. It's a cesspool that constantly berates the devs. It's awful. Thanks for all the hard work everyone puts in, good job. Looking forward to future content!
---
It has nothing to do with the community it has everything to do with Bethesda. First they released a game that was completely broken then had numerous fixes for almost 2years. Then Bethesda blames players for finding glitches or exploits in their still broken game and banned those such players. 
---
Actually the community is the only reason that this game is still going and with Bethesda in their so called community events that want players to give up all their junk for basically nothing yeah right. Oh we get rewards/plans that are already in the game from the Christmas event and the mole miner event wow ok. Then you have the nerve to say the community doesnt care about what's going on dont think so. The community shouldn't even get involved with this event or any other community event until Bethesda wakes up and actually fixes this game not put band aids on it and turns their back on us
---
To anyone who uses a build that one shots pretty much everything; knock it off. You're sucking the fun out of the game for everyone else.
---
Just so blatantly yes lol
---
Ladies and gentlemen..  we got 'em
---
Lol, what modifiers we’re on it?
---
Nup/nope
---
It's just when you can get it.  During the sale, it's more important.
---
So that makes it easier for them to land? i don't get it.
---
And this will be the last time they probably reply to your tags/comments.  I beg you to NOT delete your comments here because this is a great learning experience for you.
---
Don’t worry, the rest will be built of glass, cloth, and cork
---
On the reverse end of the spectrum, I got Unyielding with Action point boost and Reflects 15% damage while blocking (the magic effect) on my first roll. I'm guessing I have a higher luck stat in my SPECIAL IRL.
---
Well i don't know if it was like this before, but i can't add wallpaper to the wooden wall window pieces. Which blows, because I've made a spooky house at the graveyard and it looks dumb.
---
I think it doesn't help that they literally don't quest marker it… like, you have to be paying attention to their blogs or reddit or something… I kept forgetting to go because it wasn't marked. Finally made it up there after re-looking up where it was supposed to be, then randomly finding the guy. Weird.
---
I'd also like to swing by! Really curious how you got that top building canted like that. Really works for the build; looks great!
---
No thanks
---
I cant get on at the moment, but I prefer pistols. I'll message you whenever I get on that way I'll know if you are on. But thank you very much! You dont have to give me anything but anything that is made is greatly appreciated!
---
Just donated 250k
---
Little do we know those are just his parents' gamertags
---
I'm saving all my scrip from the run for if we get the 50%off sale.
---
That way I can use all my scrip and get the best use out of it. 
---
I keep my 3 characters at 1000 or close to the max, so on sale day I'll have the 3000 to spend, plus all the stuff I've not claimed yet.
---
As for bullion, I can't see there ever being a bullion sale.
---
I doubt it’s that fast too so I guess short answer is no. Thanks for the info!
---
2000 atoms per 100 days.  20 atoms per day
---
Oh yeah, for bullion and caps I just meant hitting the max amount
---
Hey man i will take it, my Xbox is OakleyW23 i should be on in about an hour
---
I don't fucking care
---
long live the Mothman he only ask for your life so you stop living in this material world of bullshit!
---
Maybe showcase the base building? You could send him some pics of the various camps others have made.
---
Too often I have 2k steel on me at nearly all times. I gotta remind myself to either craft or just dump it. I can get a sh\*t load just farming Super Mutants and scrapping  with the Perk on.
---
I don't think many realized it started. I thought each was week to week, as in steel just ending. That might be some of the reason. I know for me it is. Damn.
---
Edit: On top of that...All you said is pretty much true too, so there is that. LoL
---
Todd's going to beat the shit out of you 😒 shouldn't have provoked him
---
There aren't any. Nothing that warranted this, at least. It took creating hundreds or thousands of walls to exploit what they patched. It was a complete non-issue.
---
I saw him and graham a few days ago there
---
the behemont lately is being late for corporate business so he is taking the elevator
---
If so we should be able to shut down modus, like mr house
---
Do you realize how many tags they probably get in a singular day? Calm down, Karen.
---
He liked it
---
How about not being a tool? She doesn't personally fix bugs, and bugs are supposed to be reported using the bug report feature on Bethesda.net. With all of the tags she gets every time someone has a nifty camp or a minor annoyance, she's gonna miss some. So save yourself the anger and report your problem the proper way.

Rare in blue crates, common in yellow crates, terminals have them as an option 50% of the time. I always have a tough time finding the launch case but the codes I'm usually swimming in lol
---
I’ve find them in locked containers, orange containers, and in critters, a lot in critters.
---
Where do you get the briefcase? I’ve never seen one?
---
Happened to me the other day for the first time. Felt a bit embarrassed on the server as everyone probably thought I was an idiot and didn’t know how to launch a nuke properly to spawn the Scorchbeast Queen even though I did it hundreds of times. This game man lol
---
I mentioned this before concrete does not seem like it would be hard to come by. But it is however one of the rearest items in the game. Not that I care as much as I love Fo76 I'm hoping that at this point there is a million or so others like myself that have said enough is enough. I have a life and some days I just cant log in and some days I just wonder why Bethesda hates us so fucking much!!!
---
Luck has a lot to do with it. I’ve gotten 4 codes with no problem but couldn’t find the case. Other times I’ve gotten the case but couldn’t find the codes. After getting the case, I usually try to hit the hotspots that have a lot of crates. The other option that most people don’t go for is taking out the NPCs that are in the round also. I would say they drop nuke codes around 75% of the time and the bigger creatures like the Grafton monster always drop them.
---
One used to spawn pretty frequently in those two houses right to the left (east) of Welsh. I think it still does, although maybe not as much since Wastelanders update.
---
Sent you a friend request
---
Thank you for putting up with us. Your job must be a roller coaster, and I wish people understood that you aren't personally responsible for every gripe they have with 76. Keep doing what you do!
---
THE ENCLAVE WOULD NOT ASK FOR YOUR JUNK THEY WOULD TAKE IT IF NEEDED THIS IS NOT COMMUNISM
---
12 inches in your mom!!!
---
But for real why would I get banned? I didn’t run the script to spawn stuff in.
---
I would like to hear examples of games doing it. Sounds scummy as hell.
---
yeah u/Zazuban you should stay out of this sub if you don't want non stop single player people whining about multiplayer game economy and other shit just leave or be like me look at them and laugh at them . I pLaYeD 700 HoUrS sO gIvE Me EvREyTHınG anD lEtmE wHInE fAstER lmao
---
It provides a very easy and predictable spot for her to land. Generally she'll come out of the fissure and land on the platform on the first pass about 50% of the time. Her behavior is influenced by staggers and where she's being shot at from, so the platform works best when everyone is on it and not actively trying to stagger her. They are very effective when used properly, but can cause much grumpiness if everyone isn't onboard with the "plan"
---
Here are my 3 big lessons learned that I hope will help you!
---
1. Pick a build and stick to it! Not doing this was my biggest mistake. Early in the game I just wanted to try a little of everything. As a result I was substantially underpowered for my level, which caused me to die a LOT and frustrated me to no end. So, take a second to think about what weapon type you want to use for the majority of the game and build toward it. Rifles, auto rifles, heavy weapons, melee etc. Pick one and build around it so you are not frustrated with an underpowered build. Oh and don’t worry, after level 50 you get the option to move points and select from the full array of perk cards.
---
  2. Picklock and Hacker. These are not required and frankly, not all that important. They do very little for your build and generally only yield junk. If you have fun with lockpick/hacker then by all means enjoy. Just know that level 3 in either of these doesn’t do much for you where in counts.
---
 3. CAMP mobility vs stability. In my mid-game (20’s-30’s) I kept my base mobile. I would loot everything in an objective to the point of being massively over-encombered, waddle to a clearing and drop my camp to reap my rewards. Relocating a camp costs caps so you have to weigh the pro/con for yourself. PLEASE NOTE: You can blueprint your camp so you can keep placing the same camp over and over to save time. Just make sure it’s pretty small so you don’t have obstacles that might prevent placement.
---
4. Until the endgame, when you are well past lvl 50, don't worry about buying expensive plans.  Player vendors often sell plans for 20 caps or less because the market is saturated.  If you see a player selling something you want for hundreds or thousands of caps just walk away. --Also, those of us that have been playing since launch are so inundated with plans we often visit a lower level's camp and drop 20 at a time.
---
5. All vendors share a caps pool of 1,400 caps. It refreshes daily but that is the max you can get from ALL vendors in a day.
---
6. Use the community; we love to help.  I've had people stroll in and ask "can you make me a level 30 handmade?" and I'm like "Hell yes I can!  I'm going to mod the hell out of it too!"
---
Okay, sorry, this post got away from me here.  Welcome to FO76. Cheers!
---
Kevin was playing detective....
---
I sure hope so.
---
Honestly I find myself doing the smaller events a lot more often - AWOL armaments, riding shotgun, distant thunder etc. it’s a real shame they don’t give out treasury notes (same with dailies, I think 2 would suffice)
---
I've read this as well, but I've also seen people talk about magic shotguns. How does that work?
---
They just might do that, to buy themselves more time rather then saying yet again another DLC content will he delay 🤣
---
Or find a few  stimpacks(easy). Hide until the fire closes...enter the fire, take the stimpacks as yoir health drops and your minute passes easy. No need to spend level points and change your build to fit  NW.
---
You get plenty of time once the storm closes and if you stay near the edge you can come out right after the challenge completes.
---
Search YouTube and you can find some videos. Plus basically anywhere with water works. I think the biggest water spots are the lake by mire power plant and the lake almost in the middle of the map at the very southern edge
---
Yeah, no. No amount of crying and guilt tripping will make me partake in another useless grind, much less for a stripper pole. If it was something I could easily come by on a day to day basis, ok - like steel, wood, plastic, cloth ... I have no problem with those, and steel I donated every day.
---
But [this?](https://i.imgflip.com/4b19dm.jpg) And then cork? Guess how much are the BoS getting of those two... 
---
(If you guessed fuckall you are absolutely correct)
---
Looooool no not happening.
---
I refuse to donate
---
Try Home Depot
---
By either completing the possum world challenges, completing scout dailies (a chance as a reward), or completing the campfire tales event (also a chance reward).
---
It had to flip its goo burgers somehow...
---
Narrator: *And that's exactly what they did...*
---
50% camp budget
---
The magic shotguns are related to VATS if I’m understanding what I’ve read on that topic. I don’t think a magic shotgun works on the queen like the magic heavy guns do.
---
Psn is TheBiPolarBear25, I’m US east coast but work strange hours....
---
Honestly this is all it really comes down to. If you liked F4, then chances are quite high you will like Fallout 76. Its similar but with multiplayer. Had you asked pre-Wastelanders, that would've been different, but it has more in common with its predecessors now.
---
I bet he did.
---
Yes, very frustrating yesterday. Every single match I played there was at least 1 person who unsubtly just spawned right away from everybody else in the rim of the map and immediately killed themselves when the match started.
---
FFS, I knew it would happen as soon as I saw the challenge. Moron devs strike again.
---
Appreciate this, did exactly that!
---
Yep and Bethesda designed the entire game that way. Good for them bad for the community.(Not that they even care about this community, can you imagine the shit that is said behind closed doors or in the break room.)
---
the gold also is stamped i'd assume.. so like, how you going to do that one?
---
don't think the secret service is going to borrow us their stamp
---
Crazy thing is vats was working in pvp on the pts but i guess they didn't include that fix in the last patch. 
---
Goes to show how important pvp is to Bethesda :(
---
Lol. The Twist is it really is him.
---
thank you!
---
Yep I know how hard getting concrete is as my dumbass wanted a brick house, scrapping gnomes gets you a little bit but it seems when I needed them they disappeared
---
time may have run out on both
---
I bet we would be incredibly surprised. The game is a few years old and in the top 25 most played games on Xbox. I also imagine that a lot of people subscribe to fallout first and buy atoms here and there. I think that the best part of this game is the financial design from their revenue perspective in my opinion. I bet they do quite well even though I’m sure everyone would hate learning that. Gotta blame rockstar for perfecting a model like this. It definitely works. I’ve given them a ton of money and they’ve given me a ton of hours of fun. It’s addicting even if it’s insanely flawed.
---
You need to finish scouts quest "The Order of the Tadpole", after that you can start earning possum badges by doing daily quests "Operation Tidy" and "Stings and Things", public event "Campfire Tales" or by doing the possum challenges.
---
Well this is embarrassing
---
This is way worse.
---
Bethesda: We have heard your feedback and have decided to add a new Legendary effect to the Armor Pool, Strikebreakers! This reduces damage from Mole Miners by 15% and will also make that silly unyielding legendary effect rarer than a Red Asylum dress, I mean, who even uses that anyway /s
---
It’s got about as much protection as a wet paper bag!
---
But makes up for it in its stealth properties .. I usually end up repairing mine every day or so.. just the cost of using it
---
Someone feel free to correct me if this is wrong but I believe you spawn in close to vending. For example my vending is on my front porch, people spawn in near it. If I put a machine on my second floor they actually spawn in the middle of my camp, I've had to remove this so people don't get stuck in foundations.
---
On a much more bitter note I have a fucking awesome camp--I'm not modest anymore, I can count the nicer ones I've seen on one hand--and lazy people not even bothering to look around have forced me to stop using any more than one vending machine.
---
I would love for my secret fireplace door to be hiding my secret vending with all my best weapons and armor, but no, people can't be bothered and are in such a hurry when *you're not going to find anything better than this.* It's aesthetically interesting with color schemes and fancy details in every corner, not remotely hard to navigate or gated with a decon arch... But no, nobody can be bothered. You somehow missed the vendor and giant glowing neon sign out front, opened one door and saw a bedroom, better just leave instead.
---
imagine that there is 100k players active (with i doubt probably less than 50k between all platforms). If everyone donates 500 concrete would be like 50 million wich means everyone need to donate 1500 in this ideal scenario. The reality is like everyone should be donate like 3k of these rare resource lol
---
I didn't have a problem getting steel because it's abundant and I didn't have to go to far out of my way to deliver thousands of steel.
---
Concrete though....eesh.  I don't want to do a 'concrete run'.  This is my free time, not a second job.
---
It is a shame though.  I did want that banner and have contributed all my concrete (couple thousand).  But that's my limit.
---
I usually don’t join horde events until I can see the icon moving on the map or I know that it’s location is one of the unmarked “search points.” This event has been glitchy since launch. They sometimes spawn in the building you are suppose to search, sometimes the game makes you go into a building then directly back out, sometimes they just never spawn at all, and sometimes someone accidentally finds them and kills the leader and ends the event without even knowing the event is active. I ran into a super mutant horde outside of Harpers Ferry the other night and the event wasn’t active anywhere on the map.
---
Congrats 👏 i got mine not long ago and it's so good. Walking tank. Looks awesome too. I've been alternating between atomic onslaught paint and dark matter captain cosmos. They're both really nice.
---
Sorry trolls are downvoting your accurate historical account - They lied right from the announcement.
---
Thank you for clearing it up!
---
Training for antifa?  Or just never told the truth before?
---
I still don't even know how TF to start taking part in this
---
I actually forgot there was a concrete thing
---
I don’t think they notified anyone well enough
---
I can't wait to try this. Thanks for sharing.
---
I ran into a ghoul horde around there and it was supposed to be in that underground section.  Never found them
---
Donated 2 batches of steel to “do my part”. There’s no way I’ll be donating even a single batch of plastic and cork.  That stuff is way too rare and/or something I’m always lacking. 
---
This event is just... awful. I know it’s been said countless times, but Bethesda is really out of touch with the community. This isn’t fun, and we are bankrupting ourselves (scrap wise) by participating in this event.
---
My best advice is to find a weapon type you enjoy playing and run with it, I will say however that there are clear metas in the build department, usually in the form of low health 'bloodied' weapon builds.Some other tips/advice 
---
Stealth builds can be incredibly powerful, Power armor heavy weapon builds are probably the most common and are good all around. 
---
Food and water become much less of a problem once you get a good camp setup. 
---
Starched Genes 2/2 is is possibly the only must have perk. 
---
You can easily get caps by picking up any and all junk, either bulking it at a tinkerers workbench or selling it to any of the vendors.
---
New content can be thin in this game so don't feel rushed to complete main quests
---
Get some excavator power armor once you hit level 25---Lucky hole mine is a great way to farm lead also
---
Check player vendors to find some cheap plans and/or cheap legendaries
---
You can cash in legendary items at a scrip vendor at any of the train stations for a currency called scrip
---
Scrip resets on a roughly daily basis so cash in on unwanted legendaries as soon as possible.
---
The old "my angst is justified and yours is juvenile" trolling.
---
This is what I do. Usually by the time I'm back out, enough ash piles have despawned for me to reach more of the meat piles and repeat. Sometimes there's still too much scrap to get out unencumbered.
---
I have it installed on NVMe SSD.  It's a goddamned slideshow on PC.  i9-9900K and GTX 1080.
---
Anytime 👍 If you're planning on grinding, you can server hop the stings n things daily to repeat it (assuming they havent fixed it). So always be on the look out for those ingredients.
---
Oh cool
---
aparantly anytime you leave and re-enter you can just buy more.
---
what happens if we completed the run
---
I got a unyielding ap refresh weapon weight chest
---
ON MY JUNKIES
---
Used to be you could apply it to a plain wall and then swap the wall to a window or a door.
---
Great days...
---
Lol I agree with you. I also think it’s fixed
---
And at cranberry glade
---
Always check the map, compass directions don’t always match what the world map actually says. I’ve “found” the horde several times and be given an entirely different and new location. The indoor ones are the worst for this. That’s why I usually wait until I can see the event icon moving. Players can “search” locations by accident, so once all of them are searched the icon will just appear directly over the horde leader. Even if they are strolling through the bog with their 15 friends.
---
I hate them so much. I’ve encountered so many that just spam their murderdeathbeam continuously - can’t even get a shot in because I’m cowering behind a wall or something waiting for them to stop.
---
What I've done as of late is...I'll just make a list
---
1. 15 base strength
---
2. Marsupial(+20 carry weight)
---
3. Strange in numbers(adds +5 carry weight for marsupial)
---
4. Radicool(+5str or +25 carry weight)
---
5. A full set of unyielding armor(+15str or 75 carry weight)
---
6. Deep pocketed armor(+10 carry weight each so +50 carry weight)
---
7. A level 50 backpack(still need a few more badges for increased capacity, so +60 to +120 carry weight I believe)
---
8. Ribeye steak(+20 carry weight)
---
9. Deathclaw steak/stingwing filet(+2str or 10 carry weight)
---
10. Bufftats for fast travel only(+3 str or 15 carry weight, increases your health so you'll need to gain more rads for uny.)
---
11. Whiskey with party boy/girl for fast travel only(+2str goes to +6 so +30 carry weight)
---
12. I forget if it can stack but rad ant lager can help for fast traveling as well since it's +50 carry weight.(keep in mind, drugs and good can typically stack as long as it doesn't have a common bonus. Like from above, ribeye and deathclaw steak)
---
13. Of course, any weight reduction perks. Primarily traveling pharmacy, thru hiker, and pack rat. Weapon weight perks help as well(I've mainly been using bear arms). Bandolier and batteries included are amazing too.
---
14. If you just have and ungodly amount of weapons that you can't seem to get rid of, swap out your unyielding armor for a set with 20% weapon weight reduction perks. You can have both on a single set but that will probably be really expensive. 
---
That's all I can think of so far off the top of my head. If you need anything else, such as stash space recommendations, I could probably make some there too.
---
Seeing how we have to redeem beret in Atomic Shop, Bethesda will probably slap a pricetag on banner and make you buy it. Also don't blame our efforts, blame Bethesda for setting unrealistic goals.
---
It knows
---
Maybe I'm thinking of an armor bench. I remember a brown one being downstairs a long time ago already
---
I have to agree. I gave this an honest shot over the weekend, traveling for one exhausted farming locale to another. Concrete is plentiful for average camp builds, but it’s availability doesn’t scale to a donation goal this lofty.
---
I know several are disappointed with the rewards or hate all things BoS, but I think it is a false narrative to think protesters are actively causing this thing to tank. They were particularly vocal during the launch, and we still nailed steel in record time.
---
When it takes something like 36 bags of concrete to equal 1 donation, it’s easy to see why we’re struggling. Sometimes the simplest answer is the answer.
---
Grab abandon bog town and build three extractors. Have your camp on a concrete deposit. you get a donation an hour. If some hold bog town on every map, it would go quickly. If you dont care about the event leave bog town alone for people like me who just started playing and want those crap plans, plasma grenades and extra caps
---
Honestly would be fine with that if they made SS tradable 
---
Personally I think they should make it tradable but impossible to equip without the plan, like power armor training in 3.
---
As servant of the Mothman, I don't like that they claim and hoard technology for themselves.
---
Run into this with posters all the time...pull all the displays, tables, etc. that are next to the wall segment you want to put the poster on away from the wall a good bit, then place poster, and put all the stuff back. From your picture, I suspect the display cabinet on the right and the table with the statuettes on the left are causing the error. *edited because I can't type worth crap...*
---
Well, tbh, it's the first time *I* heard about it.  I don't sort by Hot though.
---
I feel but still. I really wanted that banner for free. I'm low on atoms and if they have a price tag, I'm hoping its 100 or less atoms
---
That's a hot mess and I love it. Nice work.
---
I’m not there yet but I’m thinking I might put the dark matter one on this, but for now I’m gonna keep it looking like it is because i think it looks awesome :)
---
And what is the “Mysterious Stranger” Stefon?
---
I know. I'm just hoping its atom price is 100 or less
---
...and/or making me not spawn over the edge of the cliff. As soon as I spawn at camp, I run as soon as I can. Tired of getting trapped under the floor.
---
I added an open room to the side of my house. I shelled out almost 10k caps for the signs and letters plans, so I have a lighted arrow with the word CRAP above it so you can't miss my machines. Also, I want to claim to be the first person to use "FAL-MART" lettering at my machines.
---
If you play every day I'm not so sure about that. Do you not use the atom shop at all? That's like saying you're not susceptible to misinformation. Maybe tattoos don't hurt for you either.
---
I hate the fact that I subbed to fo1st and now I can't play the game without it because I have nowhere to store my scrap. I just quit. The game is okay storyline wise and I'll probably come back for BoS story but after that it's dropping the game again.
---
Wait.. what?  Can you get more than the weekly 300 right now?
---
I feel like weight reduction perks are incredibly rare on SS armor. I've rolled several hundred and only about 15 have had a weight reduction perk. I'm trying to get a full set of Unyielding powered 3/5 WWR and 2/5 sentinel, haven't even gotten a single one with WWR yet.
---
I've donated 250 concrete cause it's all I had on hand. And wow ok cool
---
Thank you very much! I'm glad that a lot of people are helping me instead of just shit talking, I expected most of the comments to just Beverly shit talkers, but this has helped very much. Thank you!
---
Zealot's explosive with powerful automatic receiver and perforating mag. Made me laugh too as I really didn't expect it.
---
You can bypass all of this and get the code online from nukacrypt which updates weekly. I’ve never done the code puzzle
---
Quick Bethesda, develop, test and patch in a gun made of concrete and give it to all scorched enemies
---
Edit: Okay a pipe gives 1 concrete but we need something that gives like 20+ lol smartasses xD
---
Also drives me mad that we can only apply different flooring skins to full-floor tiles. We should be able to apply skins to the half and quarter floors. This fucks up so many of my build plans every time I start a camp.
---
You have to look for scorched or ghoul officers which hold a code piece
---
They are probably gonna still let us buy the banner...
---
“You didn’t complete this ridiculous objective, so pay money to get the reward!”
---
Disclaimer, I’m not nearly as worried about future content as others are. IMO if I played it more then I do most games, they did their job, unless I continue paying after the fact with the expectation of new content.
---
While it contains many Bethesda-esque bugs, this game is a good alternative to many MORPG’s you’ll see. If you like some of these things you may enjoy this game:
---
- Deep lore: the game is filled with little pieces of info, whether it can be gathered through context, holotapes, or conversation you can spend a lot of gameplay learning about what happened before and after the war.
---
- Light RPG elements: while you can join different factions or act how you wish in this game, there’s no real penalty or response from the surrounding environment based on your actions. Much of the rpg is through the games open-world atmosphere and other players
---
- Building: While it still needs some work, camp building can become a large part of you gameplay. There are tons of environments to build in and plenty of cosmetics to change how your camp/house looks.
---
- Exploring: 300+ hours and still finding things. While the quest lines can be lacking, you can make up for it by just traveling. Lots of amazing scenes throughout the wasteland.
---
- light survival aspects: as the fame progresses these become next to nothing in regular gameplay. While a lot of ppl are more annoyed by them, they make hunting creatures or farming actually useful.
---
- optional pvp: this was the biggest for me. A FPS with pvp that focused on pve. Having full control over whether you can fight another player or not is personally a big draw.
---
Overall, it’s a solid game that will keep evolving. There’s no commitment to pay more for any content and if you like the gameplay you’ll be able to find ways to enjoy yourself for a long time. 
---
There’s definitely better ones in the series, but more of the hate on it is because of bad PR more than being a bad game. If you played Fallout 4, you’d probably enjoy this one.
---
So here is a question.  If players don't donate enough material, will the BOS not come?  Will that be the excuse Brokethesda uses to delay (or outright cancel) this update?
---
I'd donate but I don't even have 150 concrete
---
I'm not training, friend. I don't understand how people like you enjoy fallout despite their obvious anti-capitalist/imperialist/fascist themes. Are you just that far in denial or are you just more like "hurr durr powah amah".
---
From the looks of things they won't have enough cork to worry about. For sure not gonna have enough concrete...
---
Camp spawn points changes though - I've placed my vendors near one point but often end up stuck in the floor in the bathroom. 
---
We've been asking for fast travel mat forever, (didn't we have one for a few days a long time ago?)
---
Nah don't double up *too* much. It honestly comes down to builds, chem usage etc. Perk spots are so damn valuable. 
---
The only perks I use for weight is the scrap one (75%), as the backpack mod (I did chemist) does like 90% reduction. My armor has a 20% on junk and ammo and I don't bother with food and shit I just eat whatever crap I find. I don't have a huge capacity (300lbs?) but with all the reductions I'm like a clown car.
---
Wow level 141 and only been playing 3 weeks?  I’m in the 120s and have been playing for about 3 months lol.
---
It just works :))))
---
I use the Atom shop if I have atoms and there's something I feel is worth them. I haven't spent a dime on atoms. 
---
As for your two analogies, I would counter that I'm also not susceptible to gaslighting.
---
Play the game exactly how you play a new character in fallout 4. If you were hooked to 4 chances are you will love 76. For me it’s the same game. If you get hooked, you will eventually figure out all the new stuff and create the character you love
---
On Xbox, when in trade, vendor or stash dialogue, the triggers, bumpers and dpad all scroll item/cap quantities at different rates.
---
I'm with you. I no longer believe she can be prevented from landing by shooting her in the air. I've seen her do the stagger animation and then immediately land. I've tried to reset her swoop attack by staggering her and can't do it.
---
I wanted it.....
---
Done. I’ll message you now and just hit me up when you’re on. 👍
---
Suggest you go and see him and find out what he says...
---
I thought about that, but this one hovers pretty close to the ground. I’m a melee build so I constantly think he’s about to land because of it. Instead he just screeches the whole time so I resort to fixer shots. That seem way underpowered.
---
To not waste scrap on random guns and keep for legendary modules
---
ME TOO RIGHT LEG
---
Ugh. I mean, I’ve got a decent thing in there now and I’m wearing an outfit over it so you can’t tell ... but still ... FREAKING RIGHT LEG
---
How to go about getting enough lead to make my ammo and to use perks to get extra.  When I was new - actually, even when I wasn't, I still didn't know about getting lead from lucky hole mine.  I didn't know about super duper perk and combining it with ammosmith.
---
A friend told me about using excavator power armor to collect the lead, and that i'd have to smelt it into scrap, and then I can use ammo smith with super duper perk to get lots of ammo.
---
It's been a game changer because when I was low level, and just starting to get into higher levels, I struggled with ammo and had to carry 9234892384 guns so that I'd always have ammo for whatever I had to shoot with.
---
I've been maximizing my level gain through the love book, Mama's food and public parties and perk cards...this is the excuse I tell myself as to why I'm leveled where I am, and not because I spend countless hours in the wasteland...
---
travel light
---
Scorched officer. Make sure your sound is on so you can hear him
---
still 9 a day
---
Listen for the beeping and follow it to until it is practically unbearable to hear then you will either find the body of the scorched or ghoul or find them ready to kill you. Have fun.
---
&gt;I have played Vegas, 4 and 76. But i have watched many Fallout videos and read the fallout wiki many times.
---
See that alone I suspect already puts your knowledge and understanding of the series well ahead of a lot of the people who feel compelled to frequently post about how much they unironically hate Brotherhood and love the Enclave, especially after Fallout 4 omitted one and totally rewrote the other. It's one thing to knowingly roleplay the bad guys, in fact I'd say it's a great thing to do because in a good RPG the impact it has is significant to both your character and the world, and the experience is totally different from playing good or morally gray characters. It's another thing entirely for someone to make the 15th post this week about how they're going to satisfy their bloodlust as soon as soon as a new faction of NPCs gets added because their only frame of reference for understanding them is, at best, being written as racist against ghouls and supermutants in the previous installment that takes place 2 centuries later.
---
Point I'm trying to make is you'd be surprised how many people know next to nothing about really basic, fundamental elements of Fallout's premise and the messages it, at least one time, tried to convey. Yet you still get at least one thread a day (except patch days when every post is about how broken it is) about how much the Brotherhood sucks and Enclave is the best and we're just gonna kill 'em as soon as they get here. Barring the fact that, as stated previously, basically all the named NPCs in this game are essential, choices in quests are extremely limited and the choices that do exist barely have any impact on the world (which really defeats the purpose of even trying to roleplay beyond what costumes you decide to wear), any interest in exploring and understanding the deeper themes and ideas the series was built on seem totally absent from the modern playerbase, and that's what really irks me about the hyperfactionalism for factions that barely exists to begin with.
---
Ok? We still don’t have it updated though do we?
---
Two assassin Gauss miniguns in two days. Just what I needed. Day three, Vampire's gauss minigun.
---
This quest is making me crazy, it's labeled as repeatable,  but suddenly u cant repeat it after a variable time of completions, have any idea about that,
---
Ps. For op: stings n things is the best and fastest way to get them
---
Interesting how the counter hasn’t changed since the first 24 hour ticked over. Still at 4.65 mil. I bet it doesn’t change till the end of this concrete event and Bethesda are... ‘Oh look the counter was faulty. It only registered 1 concrete per donation instead of 250. You guys did it congrats’ 🥳👍🏻
---
I saw him last weekend on PS4
---
Because at their heart the BOS is still the US military. They just needed to be reminded of their.....allegiance to a proper authority.
---
That’s actually not a bad idea. I like this.
---
It just went to game pass. Before it wasn't so it's not like those are new buyers.
---
I try to keep mine ... close ... though I have to say there are a few of my bases where I have a clear “food” and “shop” area, with a different vendor in each (they are close however, like you can see them from each other for the most part).
---
Discovered the scrapper perk card way too late in my play through.
---
I'm totally ignoring this event.
---
Just. Don't. Care.
---
Besides, there's like zero in game leads or information about it, so my "character" is not even aware of it.
---
I'm not going to be bothered.
---
I've heard rumblings about that maybe happening but all unconfirmed rumors amongst the player base
---
The 2nd line of that note should have P then 2 numbers, which you will use to fill in the corrupted data from Larry's terminal
---
I specified non-flamer for the reason that Plasma Flamer is what a lot of people use the Plasma gun for.
---
I don't want to do that.
---
Even with my stronk heavy weapons power armor build, mirelurk kings give me more of a problem than deathclaws and yao gui. Annoying little pests
---
2 words: Stealth commando :-)
---
Yup. I have every single plan and the rewards are useless. You think for a community event like this they would give items that would make everyone grind their ass to the max to get em. I always thought a community event like this would be fun. But instead Bethesda cheaped out.
---
Imma keep sayign ESO just does everything better community wise imo. They are trying to copy events from that game when they reward a ton of goodies people love. Hell we got a damn mansion player home for the summerset one where we had to all together complete the achievements .
---
They be completely dominating you and probing you with their shank hands and they still have the manners to say  "s i r"
---
150 atoms to unlock this milestone
---
I read day 1 how pointless the rewards were. So I haven’t donated a single piece. 
---
Sorry guys. This is my fault.
---
Big thanks.
---
Gee, I wonder how Bethesda could have known this? Surely, performing some wizardly action like a database query to determine the total amount of concrete active accounts currently own was too much.
---
It is like the community thinks this is a AAA development shop with employees who can do SQL queries. And then, we expect them to have designers and managers who can extrapolate. We truly ask too much.
---
They didn't
---
ExTeRmInAtE!!!
---
The grind isn't broken. It's designed to be annoying. Even Anthem has finally made the legendary system less annoying making Fallout the absolute worst in this category of any game I've played
---
the Collectron is your friend.  As soon as you have 500 atoms, or 250 if one of them is on sale, get one.  I think the Raider might be best early on, as it brings bullets.  Also, you can use the terminal so any collectron can bring you any of the item types from any collectron you have bought.
---
I understand your choice but if I was able to start duping, I would lose interest in the game because I'd be left with truely nothing to do. Each time I started cheating during my past playthroughs of other fallout games, I quickly lost interest. (except for that time when I found out there was a console command to acquire and use Liberty Prime's laser weapon in FO 3 ... most OP weapon I ever used lol)
---
Not judging you at all, though. You do you. I can understand why you did it. I'm one of those guys who still play diablo 2 from time to time because the looting system is just addicting, so, when you put a game like FO76 in my hands with such a terrible looting system, it's hard to keep playing past a certain point. Between the time gates and the whole casino stuff, I know I'll quit soon ... I just have to find another game but I haven't found one yet. :c I also like the camp building aspect but let's be honest here, it's just a place that look nice and has some facilities, that's it. In a game like Ark, your "camp" is truely the only safe haven for you on the entire map. You can make it look nice but you mostly want one to protect yourself and everything you own from all the nasty stuff that is way higher than you on the food chain so it gives you a purpose to build a super big one.
---
Gamepass is an insane new revenue stream for Bethesda? How is that an argument against what I’m saying. Microsoft has to pay developers to join their service. If you think Bethesda isn’t being compensated for the influx of new daily users you’re probably misunderstanding the gamepass model.
---
Plasma caster sucks without VATS so I wouldn’t recommend it using PA unless you don’t mind eating through all your fusion cores.
---
[](/booksaremagic)Invaluable? I don't know about anything invaluable aside from maybe the easy pile of lead and concrete at the monorail elevator. I will tell you a fact that I just find fun: Sweetwater Special Blend Tea counts as an alcoholic beverage for challenges, and is affected by party boy.  
---
Oh, and don't sleep on the bulk ammo scrap that the traveling merchants sell, it's an amazing deal for what you get. Day one me would have been very confused by that since neither the merchants or the bulk ammo scrap existed back then.  
---
Edit: Oh and also prioritize getting the weapons and armor first with bullion so it has a chance to drop as event rewards now.  
---
Edit 2: Oh and the sulpher fountain out front the Whitesprings can be used to cure your illnesses.  
---
Edit 3: Oh and if you want to keep your mutations, but aren't a high enough level to have starched genes, you can use Brahmin milk to cleanse your rads without losing your mutations. You can also farm brahmen milk by placing a Fertilizer collector attempting to milk the brahmin, and then scrapping and replacing the Fertilizer collector over and over.
---
Best cloth I’ve ever seen has been this old bookstore on the south end of the little town just north of the huge dried up river. You can loot hundreds of Burnt book there.
---
Make sure you leave the cursor in the spot you want it when you hit enter.
---
I just keep seeing people saying "People aren't doing it because rewards suck."   Well, I am speaking as someone more than willing to donate- but there is no concrete to be found!
---
i wouldn’t even be surprised if it’s a total charade and we meet the goal regardless
---
I think the Treasure Hunter one was awful. With this one people just don't care...
---
Thanks for the detailed response, I'm most likely going to pick it up later today!
---
I should have said advertising, but either way the Legendary Run is designed to keep you playing every day so you don't miss any rewards, meaning FOMO. But I guess it won't matter what I say, you're just too tough for it...
---
Also, I'm not gaslighting, it's pretty silly to insinuate but I guess it's easier to believe than questioning anything about yourself.
---
I pray to god they make it extremely cheap, and by that I mean less then 100 atoms. I'm low and I am nowhere near comoelteling any of the challenges
---
What are they?  Wanted to make sure mine weren’t auto-completed...
---
https://imgur.com/a/n4GoF72
---
Yeah pretty sure with petty in game shit they don't bother the executives of companies, it'd just be a sudden silent ban. 
---
It's like notifying the CEO of McDonald's that Karen in Bumfuck Idaho didn't like her burger today. Although I don't compare Toddles to a CEO of that calibre don't get me wrong.
---
Makes me wonder who the CEO of Micky D's is.... Probably Grimace. He oozes leadership. Birdy is definitely HR I know that. Ronald- PR. Hamburglar- Aquisitions.
---
I'm fairly certain underground bunkers are planned to be an extension of the surface camps. Why on earth would they remove such a massive part of the game that so many love? Just look at all the backlash they have received just for breaking some building techniques. 
---
Bethesda is known to make some dumb choices when it comes to this game but doing that would be insane even for them.
---
*"It's this thing when a midget stands next to a hole in the wall and..."*
---
&gt; I know several are disappointed with the rewards or hate all things BoS, but I think it is a false narrative to think protesters are actively causing this thing to tank. 
---
I think it is a false narrative too.  I am speaking as someone who is willing to farm concrete.  But- I'm being serious here- it is nowhere to be farmed.  I keep finding all the concrete bag hot spots completely empty, which means I can't donate. And I know that I am not the only one experiencing this.
---
Not saying it's broken.  Just saying players are annoyed with it.
---
There’s about to be a bunch of them due to the gold bullion glitch thanks Bethesda
---
This system seems far too complicated to implement effectively. This would also mean adding weapon and armor mod slots to a very large number of already in game items, unless you intend to limit it to only the prefix effect. Almost all melee weapons and all armor pieces would need at least one mod slot created.
---
It’s a step in the right direction, but the idea of keeping effects as mods only works for certain weapons. I think the only way we will ever get this functionality is through some type of re-roll mechanic.
---
And before we get that, I would personally like to see them prioritize a system to let you level up weapons and armor. With events like rad rumble giving large numbers of non max level legendaries there needs to be a way that these aren’t just immediately useless for trading because of their drop level.
---
NP,as soon as ya shoot me a message,I’ll pop on as long as I’m able to,&amp; would be glad to hook ya up
---
One shot it ... my best advice
---
Oh my gosh, this is great!
---
Yeah I traded for a god rolled Gauss Minigun (Junkies 25 25) off a duper who had done loads and loads of crafts and got basically two good miniguns out of the whole lot (the one he kept for himself was J 25 15r, I think). This was when you could whack people out of the scrip machine and claim it. Best 40 scrip ever spent (along with some other nice Junkie heavy guns).
---
Cause she is a very dirty girl...

I have her just wearing a sack hood. It blends in with the rest of her

HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAAAAAAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAAAAAAA
---
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAAAAAAA
---
Bethesda play their own game?
---
Don't feel bad. I looked at how much was needed to donate and decided I needed it more.
---
Happy Cake Day.
---
yes
---
legendary shit.. especially 3* shit.. wasnt ever supposed to be common...
---
between duping and the purveyor 3* gear is way more common than it ought to be...
---
Is it ONLY concrete now? Cause that’s all I can find.
---
It was a stupid event the whole time.. this is a game base around resource.. we ain’t going to give it up unless it worth our time and those rewards are weak.
---
I’m sure some player will give them up but no real player will
---
The main thing I learned from Fallout is that bears love springs, or bears are made of springs?  Something about bears and springs.
---
People have been saying it is not working at the moment since the last update.
---
Allowing to re-roll one (and only one) of the 3 perks for, say, 10 modules per roll would be good too.
---
Stop using the wooden shack walls.
---
Its manually updated, so I sure hope not. He may have had a family...
---
Game Pass isn't even making Microsoft money. Bethesda is obviously gonna get money from mtx but I wouldn't think they are breaking any records. Of course the whole point of this game was to make money to fund ES6 and Starfield
---
It's the game you'll hate yourself for loving
---
I would recommend it if you enjoy the fallout universe
---
Soooo Im starting to wonder if the point of all this is FO76 is having backend issues with keeping track of the contents of every 1st members neverending scrap boxes.  Thats an insane amount of concrete, to the point that I suspect the only way to meet their "goal" is if a certain amount of people are convinced to stop hoarding materials.
---
DONE! I have got your giant bird covered 🤣

Level 415 on main. The lesson I learned, don't buy this game. I love it but it's never fixed and only becomes worse with each update. Like your significant other cheating on you but then your OK with it because they changed hair style or are wearing new clothes you like on them. The cheating is just never addressed. Welcome to fallout, BTW we made mod for deep pocketed on ss armor, we just wanted to let you know we made it....oh oh and we made a cool event that you'll beat very easily and we are going to tease you with it for a long long time, even play it in front of you and all of the Internet to see but you......you do not get to play it, you're just not good enough. 13$ a month for fallout please.
---
So much this!   
---
Unfortunately my current build doesn't allow for the scrapper card to be constantly on, so reminding myself that I need to apply it before I scrap has become a headache.
---
Doubtful.
---
That’s a good technique. This is what I have been doing lately

While you may find it perfectly easy to find a few stimpaks I have horrible luck with it even with Pharma Farma equipped.
---
Different methods for different players.
---
All good just saying with the pulse capacitor it is broken and shoots projectiles and you can use it as a sniper
---
You could get about 100 per day before, but it required some effort grinding challenges. How is that not technically farming?
---
Biggest bummer so far ... I was so happy to find someone decent looking, as I wanted to build a peepshow at my camp - and needed to replace the butterface Sophia. The moment I put the prison collar on the wanderer I was like - ok, honey, no. Put your clothes back on... please.
---
Super Duper and Ammosmith have been game changers for me! I just learned about them 3-days ago!
---
Game sucks
---
I just think it’s probably a profitable game is all. I think the perception that it’s a failure is on a purely a financial basis. We are all speculating though since they’re not publicly traded.
---
Players are annoyed but that’s their fault.  They can’t stand the idea of not being min/maxed to the hilt.
---
Hey! We're neighbors, I live on the water behind the Nuka Cola plant. Maybe we'll see each other sometime

So much this!  
---
I sell those bullets in my vendors for 1c and it's how I make most of my daily revenue + whatever I get through mobs and quests/events.
---
I usually start my day around 210 out of 270...plus have the Excav PA if I’m ever in a bind. 
---
I’ll have to rebuild my cards at some point soon, I expect- thanks for the info.
---
The Dross Toss daily only gives 3 tokens if you throw the dross at all 3 of the tires. Throwing them all at the same tire will only give you 1 token. I could never understand why that daily screwed me over so often.
---
So many lost tokens...

Im gonna laugh my ass off when he goes to greet them and gets a plasma size hole through his chest, surprise! It's the Outcasts.

This may be old but if something is incorrect then tell people why, not sound like an all-knowing ass without giving any info to the conversation at all.

I got rushed today, my wife wanted me to stay near her while she rested, so I hurriedly launched a nuke and logged off. I dropped it on prime so people could go play with the SBQ, otherwise, I would I have dropped it on Atlas. C'mon BOS, I'm waiting.
---
Hell yeah, thank you so much man!
---
I'd like to expand her play list ...
---
Equip a magic heavy weapon the builds are the same, just use it for good and lay off after your tag
---
Ahh?!? I probly wouldn't than either since have no desire to see the "Best and brightest the world has" dancing in their dirty fucking underwear like a feral living in the woods.
---
Cork BOS armor 2,000,000,000 damage, electrical resistance, rad resistance, &amp;c.
---
Did you say you want more broken stuff? Sure thing!
---
Good tip, go play something else like PUBG or Conan or anything else where developers fix the issues and non end game content.
---
They need those springs to add extra oomph to their world class bear hugs
---
Soon it will be mine. I delayed getting it because I wasn't ready to part with my legacy Ultracite Jetpack arm... But screw it, I want this armor more.
---
I’m missing my moth man and robot dancing emotes too :(
---
For the enclave!
---
It’s not the BOS it’s just the greedy bastard at atlas with no actual real connection to the BOS
---
I scrimped, I saved, I grinded, I bought, week, week weeks...Finally got the secret service armor set only to find I should've paid more attention and researched a little more when I realized I wasn't getting the power armor, but the regular armor..."oh, so the T-65 is actually the secret service POWER ARMOR YOU DUMASS!"
---
...scrimp, save, grind, buy...weeks more to go.
---
Ash piles after update 21 = FPS death

I would probably be the guy to then build my camp on top of a mountain, have several pools built, and a water purifier in each

No they want it to fail so they can provide a half ass half built base like foundation and crater!
---
Her constant playing bothered me much more than her dirty appearance.
---
Worse then before but I wouldn't say it's new. The whole game is like a slide show most of the time.
---
Good to hear! If you’ve watched videos and liked it I think you’ll like the game. There isn’t really any hype around it like most games that gives you a false impression of what it’s actually like
---
The whole Fortify Atlas has nothing to do with grinding the mats in 4 days and donating. The devs clearly have the ability to see how much junk the player base has and they set the bar accordingly. Problem is, the average player doesn’t have 1k of each. Only the dupers do and asking them to hand over their junk is crazy. 
---
They literally saw there’s around 500 million to 1 billion of each junk item and thought to themselves the community can easily achieve the goals they set for turning X amount in. 
---
4 days was just to give people the window of opportunity to empty their stashes.
---
Isn't that the Operation Tidy daily? There's a Mr. Handy counselor around that area who will give you a quest.
---
S or X, I've done it twice on X and didn't notice a problem.
---
Put a marine wetsuit helmet or csa helmet on them. Its the only way...

My 2 cent: they will say that the site was bugged, and that we reached the goal and then they will "fix" it

talk to the robot

Fill me in, what is rng?

I believe scrapping a lead pipe gives 1 concrete.

I think I d caught Mad Dog 4 times in one hour. You're right though, it does seem that public events are bottoming out. I do have to admit to enjoying the kid hunting bugs at campfire tales though. Next time it pops up, I'll have to do it again. About March it seems.
---
extra damaged to scorched creatures
---
This was part of the reason i ~~quit~~ started my extended break again.  I already don't have tons of time to play anymore and burning through a absurd amount of modules to never get what ib want just killed it for me.  
---
I'm all for a grind as i played WoW for years,  but this thing where you can dump countless materials and do countless kills and never even see what you are liking for just did it in for me and had me restart my periodic long vacation.
---
you can stay logged in long enough to make your trades tho right?
---
There should be a quest given by the Mr. Handy bot outside called Operation Tidy. It’s a repeatable daily. Talk to the bot, follow the map markers to pick up toxic sludge, and deposit it in the blue barrels at the next cabin.
---
I understand that but I'm mainly more concerned about the art style and everything.
---
You are always welcome to my camp, I didn't even bothered to craft a shower=)

But it doesn't seem like this even in the SS armor crafting random legendary

Another one...

After you complete the tadpole scout quests and unlock possum challenges you can craft a 60 pound backpack automatically for free. I had no idea and was using the 30 pound small backpack for like 2 months.
---
First you’ll have to take a step through the puddle of concrete
---
because those were daily challenges. you did them, then you were done. "farming" means being able to repeat an action as often as you'd like.
---
I am curious, how do you get the flamer mod for the chainsaw, I've been trying to get it for some time now
---
I've been trying to teach her how to use VATS, but she hasn't quite grasped it. My main weapon is a magic shotgun, so I use VATS religiously.
---
Pretty much everything that fires bullets can have Ultracite Ammo. It requires knowing the "Prime Receiver" mod, and will have the highest damage out of any Receiver, usually tied with the "Hardened" Receiver, but without the condition penalties.
---
The only downside is that to craft Ultracite Ammo, you need to use Stable Flux of varying color, which can be a bit much to grind for some weapon types.
---
See, I don’t really mind this stuff. Spent a few hours collecting concrete yesterday, going to places I don’t normally visit on my farming route, and encountered several legendaries along the way, as well as completing my daily challenges.
---
 Think it’s neat to contribute to something as a whole community, but I guess people just want to complain...
---
Love it. Of course, I'm 55 and every once in a while, I go to third person view and hop around the land. I was fighting some scorched one day from behind cover, I would jump up, aim and shoot at them. Jump up, aim, and shoot at them.
---
Isnt work at Bethesda just one big lunch break, I mean I cant believe there is many people on Fo76 team crunching.
---
Cute conspiracy theory, bro. Did you really make an account just for hating on Fallout 76?
---
I didnt know this though I always just try to hit all three anyway
---
The lack of an in-game collection bar that updates at least every hour is not helping matters. I donated 1,000 of the 1500 concrete I had in my scrapbox then had to wait until an external website updated to tell me that the community had given a whopping 4.65 million concrete. Bethesda hasn't updated the counter a single time since.
---
If that counter were in-game where we could see actual progress being made, perhaps I'd fire up my private world, take every workshop that has concrete and set up extractors while running around the game collecting concrete and golf balls. I could have done that for 10+ hours a day the last two days on two accounts and donated (guessing) 5k concrete. That's not even a drop in the bucket.
---
I chose to do chores around the house instead. Seems like a more productive use of my time.
---
Same man. I move a lot and even though I have a solid amount of resources I end up hoarding it all. And honestly I think the BOS event is pretty cool in theory. I like community influence on the game. That being said, the rewards seem pretty weak. I can't bring myself to give up scrap. The purveyor sale would be cool but even then I can only put so many 3 star Exterminators Boards in my stash.
---
I got marsupial randomly long before having access to starched genes. I was pretty sad when I lost to overwhelming rads. Now I have the perk maxed and have herbivore.. but gosh do I miss eating radstag steak.
---
yes, it is green and has a red star on it.  The Revolutionary collection mode brings you frag grenades, blood packs (which are needed for making stimpaks, and Chinese officer swords.
---
Need prime reciever plans for your weapon to learn how to make it/use it.
---
I actually have plenty!  I had that issue but now I make sure I kill every stingwing, cricket etc I come across, and scrap their body up.  
---
I do loot acid nodes when I see them too.  During some of the events in the past, I think it may have been meat week, hoards of crickets spawned in the Ash Heap and I made sure to pick them clean.
---
It’s a side mission and every time I go to the bot he says that badge won’t earn itself
---
Not if you dont play the game and have no concept of what resources are abound.
---
How are people suffering from all this. I’m sympathetic don’t get me wrong. But the only bug I have is the fast travel. That’s it. No glitches, graphics or otherwise.
---
Plastic might be doable but I agree with the rest. I only had about 1000 in my box, I only picked it up to try to make a foundation based camp.
---
Dude, you're trying to go toe to toe with a flying creature. If your pride gets in the way of that, that's on you.
---
I have three vendors outside my camp right in the open and labeled to their contents to make all my shoppers feel safe and happy. But my camp is currently a strip club so i moved a vendor inside that’s sells hoes exclusively(I know it’s childish, but you would not believe the amount of people willing to spend 500c on a hoe as a joke I’m making a killing)
---
This is true tbh I could of had it by now by doing that but im just lazy idk why I just don't want to start a new character
---
I have fun with BOS play throughs in FO games, as well as blowing them up. At this point I’m happy for anything new. 
---
This is just drudgery.
---
You need the prime plans for the receiver of the gun to craft the ammo. Ultracite shotgun shells require stable fluorescent flux and ultracite along with the usual scrap to be crafted.
---
ok, noob question. how do you get acid from fertilizer, is it just from the bags?
---
I'm guilty of rebuilding mine at least every week or two. Something can always be done just a bit better...
---
To craft ultracite ammo you need to learn the plans for Prime receiver for any weapon that has it, when you learn it you can automatically craft said ammo (Thought it is bugged on some of the new weapons). The receiver does extra damage to scorched and scorchbeasts. The pumo action has a prime reciever, i have no idea about the other variants.
---
Dense is 50% explosive damage I believe.
---
I've noticed that dense, fireproof, and explosives can be weird though. One example is that I could hit a ghoul with several landmines and do next to nothing. Then I can blow up one at my feet and it can do either nothing or most of my health.
---
All ballistic/energy weapons have a “Prime” receiver, capacitor, frame, etc. These switch the ammo type to ultracite that boosts damage against scorched beast, specifically used for Queen farming. You learn to make the ammo by learning a Prime mod that requires that ammo type. So learning a prime .50 cal receiver will allow you to craft ultracite .50 cal ammo.
---
The rewards you get each time you donate for Atlas are pretty much just reboxed Christmas presents. Its stupid.
---
I font think bethesda would have decided to role back the patch if less then 1 percent of firsties quit 2 percent quit minimum it has to be something they would notice
---
Isnt that the schorched reciever?
---
90% of the time one of the players is trade glitched anyways so it's porting around or dropping it on the ground. Or I am stuck having to press the button to fast travel just to go no where over and over and over.
---
I don't understand your jab at trading, I like that aspect of the game is there some problem with that?
---
They ran out of Tiggers
---
I am the same way with cheating, for the most part. 
---
But there is also a drastic difference between 5 pieces of armor and a weapon or two, and like 50 mods that let you be a god.  I still play the game regularly. Now I just do enough damage to always loot the queen and I don’t die as often. 
---
I did 2 years playing legit. I did my trading game, but trading subs have become so toxic, I don’t even want to trade anymore. My weps that I collected to trade sit on a mule, and as I make more friends, I outfit more people for free. I launched hundreds if not thousands of nukes on the queen. Never got anything noteworthy.
---
At some point, the grind just becomes a burden and takes you away from enjoying the game. I enjoy the game now.
---
When scarped it gives you fertilizer and acid.
---
Ahmazing!!!!
---
I also had major FR when doing encrypted today it just seems like the bugs are getting worse and it’s so baffling how there is no patch
---
You need to collect toxic mutagenic waste in another area of Toxic Valley. It should be marked on your map.
---
As a PC player I absolutely don't understand why bethesda didn't create crossplatform play between xbox and ps players. It seems so freacking obvious
---
So I grind this game 24/7 just for someone to pop out with a glitch, if only people would play the game legit, right
---
You inbred capitalist dogs!
---
woe calm down there. I find it sad because I think that the main storys boss should be fightable with all weapon types, I don't know what your problem is to start with pride here.
---
Ah right, thanks
---
That's a good passive way to get it. My issue now is I'm lacking oil for flamer fuel. I should probably start using the ammo machine, I've got so much .44 from my pistol build.
---
or embarrassed
---
Bethesda level devs are sweating at the sight!  Excellent build!  Easily the best lore friendly build I've seen yet.
---
My husband and I play together and it’s our favorite thing. He gets so jealous when I find better loot than him and it’s gives me bragging rights for the next week.
---
I didn’t trade the pieces that didn’t work for me, I just gave them to friends who were also frustrated with their success. Made many people’s day 😊
---
I never said they would, I just said its Bethesda "attempt " to do this and honestly when was the last time the did something that made sense
---
It's that thing where you dress two settlers and a raider in fancy clothing and then see how long each of them lasts at the Whitespring before they get kicked out or murdered by the robots.
---
Oh Idk something that's actually engaging.
---
Actually new and interesting rewards.
---
Super Duper also is great when bulking salvage for selling.
---
Haha kinky... But seriously I just want them to shut up except Beckett he's cool 👍
---
I've watched a couple videos that said the game wasn't good, but idk why I just keep coming back too it and wanting to try it
---
Yesterday I joined a bog fog crawler horde event. It spawned in one if the mines in the bog, north of Fort Defiance, (can't recall the name now) and the fog crawlers were stuck underwater and I had no way to hit them
---
it’s more of an event when i take my morning piss
---
There would be some kind of irony in them actually doing that SQL query, seeing the total be like 200 million, and then banning some duper that had 130 million.
---
And/or - the guys that have millions of concrete just haven't logged in for six months.
---
This happened with the first SS Underarmor too. But I will have to say it was worth the wait. Camo SS UA looks awesome, I wish they would make the scout armor in a matching camo with Combat and SS armors.
---
Wait there is a free 'tab? I have been scrolling through every item individually to see if it was labeled free.
---
Yup that's right! For example, for the dual wielding perk can be made so the left handed weapon cannot have the same effects as the right. Limiting your effects, or maybe the secondary weapon just has nerfed stats if they share the same perk as the right hand. You don't need to implement ideas in a bubble, You can make them work if you want it to.
---
The whole idea is to inspire devs to make something similar.
---
Dat hat do
---
I'd definitely recommend taking workshops with mats you need.  Just return often to loot.  People are less likely to fight for it when you're there often.
---
Yeah um I got mine yesterday but I don’t know how. Yesterday I completed the brotherhood missions and revived a power armour frame and later on I went to my base and placed it down to find out that it was a full set of lvl 50 ultracite power armour on it but I don’t know if it was intentional.
---
&gt; Its manually updated
---
Shit I did not know lol.
---
Rewards that people care about and possibly have it be new quests instead of just asking us to grind the same junk items we've been farming since launch
---
Maybe that is so but don't you think at this point it should be from a lack of players willing to donate?!? I mean how much longer as a community are we going to tolerate them doing these pointless fucking events or repeating the same old bullshit event over and over. Where is the creativity that once existed at Bethesda?!? Where is the great story telling and the mind blowing twists and turns?!? Give me a break people and demand more than this or we will never get the game we deserve and want.
---
Well the goal would still be too high even if the rewards were good enough to get more people to grind, as concrete is not really grindable the same way steel or other resources are, the spots where it spawns are already picked clean constantly right now so more people searching them wouldn't help much, the only reliable source would be extractors but they don't yield all that much
---
Why did I find a plasma core in a bloat fly?
---
Definitely isn’t lost. We’re talking about the worst year for developers since ‘08, and they chose the one gaming model that would suffer from this pandemic.
---
I’m still enjoying my game a lot and fast travel is the only bug that has annoyed me to any considerable amount, as well as the camp building fix. If this is F76 at its lowest, I’m looking forward to it’s next high.
---
Plus I don’t think people realize that only 4 months ago bethesda was able to quadruple its playerbase with wastelander’s. Not saying there aren’t a lot of problems, cause there are, but this “beginning of the end” talk is more full of guano than those Mothman cultists.
---
Honestly maybe lowered the amount of  items required to be donated by the community or maybe for our time we spent gathering them some better rewards per supply box we got from donating.
---
Thank you so much man! Major props to you :)
---
I only use them outside of PA because they are very much a vats weapon. I got very lucky with rolls and got an AA and a bloodied in my first few tries. Both do well but the bloodied is a wrecking machine.
---
Uranium Fever or just running through Harpers there are benches within like 3 screens of where you are killing stuff.  So clear out the area, then scrap.
---
I think the game will continue for a while, through next season at least, but the infrequency of updates and bug fixes will continue through the rest of its life.
---
We're looking at very minor content here and there, a lot of the same recycled ad nauseam, hopefully long overdue fixes every now and then, and likely a lot more things breaking along the way.
---
Expect delays for every major update, every time, it's really the only way not to be disappointed. Personally I'm going to finish the Legendary Run and take a long overdue break, hopefully come back when something as game changing as public teams hits. There's just too much else going on and so many better games out there.
---
Account or character?
---
Its amazing I have over 2000 gold and over 700 notes and I haven't spend any gold yet since wastelanders I used to trade 20 notes a day for 200 gold but not anymore nothing from the SS is interesting me just waiting to hit max reputation with the raiders hopefully they got something good
---
I think this is the first time I’ve ever seen a community event in a game fail before. Guess we’ll get to see if Bethesda is really going to pretend that we somehow got the extra 146 million in one day, or if they’ll just lower the amount and pretend that was the correct amount the whole time. Or maybe we just actually failed this step, who knows?
---
I'll make sure to check this tree every time I pass now  😈
---
I have 4/5 powered WWR. And it took all those modules. My chest I rolled naturally (didn’t have enough time to buy the chest plan before it was patched).
---
It’s hard for me to say weight perks are rare. I rolled like 15k, and got quite a few. Vanguards and unyielding seem to be the rarest. Unyielding I probably got 10 pieces all together. Vanguard.... maybe 20? Got a lot of bolstering, chameleon wwr. Waaaaay more useless prefixes, and waaaaaay more useless prefixes and useless other perks
---
This is how it should be.
---
Set up a donation box. Everyone gives what ever they want. When you give 250 of any random material you receive the first reward and so on. The last day you can donate is when the Bos actually arrives.
---
I don't understand why it would take millions of certain items at a set date to build a poorly constructed military base.
---
Like usual, good idea but such a poor execution.
---
We don't want this, I sometimes wonder if the people that come up with these ideas even play their own games. If they don't play why don't they ask us? Will save so much time in the development of the game if they just asked the community.
---
Yea and she was the only decent looking female (Sophia looks like a guy), but she's too dirty to use most outfits
---
For example I tried to make her a diner waitress in my diner themed camp build but she looks like she just jumped into a mud puddle
---
It’s only sprinting. Also sentinel only works while standing and not crouching
---
Umm... I'm chill dude. Just saying if a fight presents itself as not ideal to your combat preference &amp; you don't adapt, the problem isn't the fight, it you. That's all. 
---
What you choose to do with that is entirely on you. Just don't expect any sympathy if you choose not to adapt.
---
Once you clean up the waste you have to dispose of it in the blue barrel in front of the cabin you spawn behind.
---
Yeah you’re supposed to get a full set of ultracite power armour when you complete that mission, this power armour is way harder to get because it costs gold bullion
---
Actually been running extremely well for me. And I killed about 60 ghouls last time, so I’d say I stressed my game more than usual. Whatever the issue is, it seems it’s not as simple as just the meat piles being too much for the game.
---
Friend had it and gave it to me when he saw me running around with a chainsaw. Don’t know how rare it is. You on ps4?
---
The Arktos Pharma backpack skin is bugged and will never drop as a plan, it just gets added to you list without any notification. If you've done Project Paradise a lot check your backpack skin options, there's a good chance it's there.
---
it’s an issue with the wood walls, the others work fine.
---
I'd love to read the story of how y'all met sometime. I'm sure it's got to be just as awesome.
---
A lot of us decided not to give them anything from the start and I still won't.  #fixpvp
---
It stands for random number generator. 
---
Essentially, anytime you kill a legendary or visit the purveyor, a slot machine handle gets pulled. All the perks and type of weapon/armor get randomly pulled. 
---
Fallout 76 has terrible RNG. Most legendaries give 1 star loot, and most of it is not the desired rolls. Same with the purveyor.
---
Yeah sorry I just realised it was T-65 I thought it was ultracite and that’s good to know thanks
---
Only a small percent of the boxes have a 100% spawn chance.
---
Congratulations! I am only missing one piece of my secret service armor so I should have my respective set soon too!
---
I love this and you so much right now. Good show, GOOD SHOW!
---
Trust me I don't want it to be over, nor do I think it is, I am just asking an honest question.  I have played every fallout game from the start and enjoyed them all. It is just getting worse and worse and it is quite alarming. I've never played a game with so many issues.
---
Is that why I have that skin now?! lol Awesome!
---
youre right.. 
---
they should just not do it ever...
---
shoot ground
---
I'm still trying to understand the benefits of bulking salvage. 
---
Isn't it just the same amount of materials, but bulked into 1-item?
---
Slap that clandestine paint on it, make it sexy
---
Pretty sure it's just designed to get some duped junk off the market
---
I've got first so there's that, it's just aside from this event I don't really need to collect mats. I had someone gift me about a hundred of each flux so I could mod my PA which was awesome, but otherwise I pick up most stuff in buildings and bodies and just stash it. Nodes don't seem very good imo when you can run through an area like tanagra and server hop twice. I have my camp at a junk pile but all of my stuff is open for newbies.
---
it was a joke, obviously. doubt we'll expect any more colossi.
---
Account
---
What's that? You want 3 new plans mixed in with 25 old plans, each of which has a .001 drop chance? Gotcha!
---
&gt; Also, you can use the terminal so any collectron can bring you any of the item types from any collectron you have bought.
---
Come again?
---
Interesting, I didn't know about the pulse capacitor thing.
---
Thank you.  I'll look more into this.
---
Maxed Blocker is a must for pretty much every build.. 
---
Ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game...
---
Yeah on like the 'new' tab at the top if you hover over it there's a bunch of different screens with whats on sale and such. One of them is labelled free and special offers
---
Even the regular non-public events seem to be less common.  I’ve been trying to obtain the Leather Coat which apparently has a 0.02% drop chance and the only way to get one are events and quests specific to the Mire.  It’s A Trap and Irrational Fear rarely seem to happen so I have better luck server hopping.
---
No I play on pc but thanks anyway, I have one chainsaw mod that I got from scrapping my first one but haven't got any additional once by scrapping more so I'm not sure if I can get them that way
---
Sure they will!
---
500 ATOMs, coming soon.
---
Enforcer doesn't affect splash damage anymore, and splash damage itself from Shotguns seems to be way toned down.
---
For the longest time, while I was doing the Tadpole quests, I was like, "This isn't going to be worth the +20 weight" 
---
Then I realized I could do the top backpack once I had it and was like WTF! haha
---
These Possum challenges though...holy moly...are these real? haha has anyone completed them?
---
Oh damn, I forgot about them too, those nasty things still give me creeps.. still remember those abominations
---
As someone who has ~450 hours and have had FO1st for a few months, I only have like 750 concrete. I have no clue how Bethesda thought we'd be able to find 150 *million* in 3 days.
---
Also, until this whole event thing started, I didn't even know cork existed. What do you get it from and what is it used for?
---
Never beat it.. guess it's time to dust off the old emulator.  Loved the first few levels.
---
What can they even offer at this point? Most are already leaps and bounds beyond the standard BoS Buzz Light-year power armor and lasers that are woefully underpowered unless they're on a ceiling turret
---
cripple the head
---
Definitely stopping by! I had been wanting to change my base up and looking for inspiration!!
---
Good luck! After completing my last public event I was so excited because I finally had enough to finish the set,  ow all that’s left is some mods and I’m good to go
---
Sadly there is always a dupe, the dupers just keep a very tight lid on their favorites.
---
I think I'm going to join you on that, I'm at 96 just by playing the game of and on and finishing the dailies. The frustration of horrible frame rates and bugs that either crash my game or force me to reset it are just becoming to much.
---
Until fallout, any morpg I played took years to get endgame armor and even then it was always evolving so that armor would always be outclassed. 
---
I don’t know why it’s so appealing that every player should be able to get the best item in the game after only playing a few months. That would make for an extremely boring online game.
---
That’s fine, as long as it’s available in some way or another. I want my camp item.
---
I've never even heard of the briefcase before. I have no idea how to launch a nuke in the first place
---
I would pay top atom for a fo76 stripper pole just saying.
---
Can they be learned by scrapping?  The reciever.
---
Yeah I won't be having mods right away either but I have multiple good legendary versions already so it's been going great!
---
Agree to an extent. I don't think any card is essential but some are definitely over powered. Perk card balancing should be one of the their top priorities imo. The trash cards need major buffs to compete with the top cards. Damage and armor penetration cards should get nerfed again imo.
---
So cool!
---
Why the fuck do they need so much concrete
---
Even just one would be cool.
---
When you kids are done playing your game of Mazes and Monsters with your Paladins and lances and stuff, join the real United States and serve the Enclave.  Your medieval technocracy will not be permitted to fester in our beloved West Virginia.  BoS steal technology and murder innocents to keep it away from the people.
---
Because nobody is buying FO1st for the tent
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3wKzyIN1yk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3wKzyIN1yk)
---
I donated 250k
---
Simple, to save them for when they actually arrive. This whole thing is just a reskinned version of the last "wow do all this stuff and get a grand prize of more meat week"event
---
I do think inheriting code that has two decades and several dev teams of strata and petrified code would be challenging for a new studio during a pandemic and global instability. Not to say they aren't among a luckier set given the new prominence of digital life.
---
Several Workshops have concrete
---
Hear hear, the Fallout universe is a darker one.
---
I go upstairs in fort defiance and scrap it all myself
---
That's if people on your friends list can join. Would have been nice if they had thought half a second and released an invite system.
---
If they ever do decide to update NW, their top priorities should be-
---
hackers&gt;lag reduction&gt;balancing&gt;new content.
---
I came here just to watch the shitshow. I had just checked [fallout.com](https://fallout.com) com and saw the progress bar at like 5% maybe. haha. What the hell bethesda? like, what the hell.
---
Yep sad people can literally get any amount of gold they want rn
---
Bro wait, your budget is based on level???
---
I don't even know what that is, would you mind telling me?
---
I have been a hoarder of scrap and junk since day 1. Everything gets dumped into my scrap box and I had about 2k in concrete. And there is just no way to farm / find enough to make the numbers Bethesda is looking for. Cork is the same way. Plastic may be just as bad depending on what can be found on scrapped laser weapons.   
---
This was amazingly short-sited by Bethesda.
---
Funny you ask, I just completed my last Possum challenge yesterday. They're a lot more manageable when you've played for a while and know offhand how to do each step the easiest way. The cooking one was by far the most annoying for me. I had to kill over 20 scorchbeasts (with butcher's bounty 3) to get 3 scorchbeast meats for one of the recipes.
---
What platform you on? xbox i’d be glad to help
---
No.  Because that might be seen as listening to the pvp community.  Duh.  We're criminals haven't you heard?
---
I had a level 19 come in my camp not long ago so I crafted him a level 20 fixer and some BOS under-armor for free. I accepted a friend request and he kept pm me asking for more free shit! I thought the same thing...must be a kid. I eventually told him if he brought the materials, I would craft him whatever he wants. That did not interest him. I eventually found out he was 9 years old and he eventually took the hint and quit coming around asking for free shit!
---
It’s been a bug for awhile. Was able to be worked around by placing a a door and wallpapering that then switching back.
---
Hopefully we see a major overhaul with camp shelters or sooner.
---
That's really dumb reasoning if that's actually the case. Dupers flooding the market with cool stuff making it available but worthless is better than not having cool stuff at all and I feel like this is really obvious.
---
Against people?  I doubt it
---
I don't consider this an event to be honest, more like donate shit you grinded for to get some other stupid shit. Was kinda funny that today I opened atom shop cuz I saw a free item, and it didn't even show, there was no picture, I guessed what it was by the name xD Was kinda funny to go to NW and see everyone wearing that, probably forgot to unfavourite it, lol.
---
No. Everyone has the same amount of budget regardless of lvl.
---
why the fuck do they need so much leather. arent they literally known for rocking power armor ? not fucking sturdy leather armor
---
For plastic you can farm laser weapons from mutants and use scrapper to get decent amounts.  Think it's likely to pass.
---
Well the enclaves gonna have top notch stuff, they are the government. Would be cool to get an enclave space dlc
---
I think the XP should be balanced for full-health builds too.
---
so I have purchased the regular collectron, the communist one, and the raider one from the atom shop.  As a matter of personal preference, I do not like the commie bot, or the raider one walking around my camp, but sometimes I want to be brought blood packs or bullets.  So I use the terminal connected to my regular collectron and change the collection type to Revolutionary (from the commie bot) or weapons and ammo (from the Raider one) and my plain boring collectron will now bring me blood packs or bullets.
---
But it isn't anymore.  Or gamma, or laser...
---
not my idea but a rival enclave event.
---
Huh. I actually like that.
---
Instead of auto-completing it, or letting it fail, they ACTUALLY changed the requirement to something that's actually reasonable.
---
Good move, devs.
---
It's the wasteland... over a year outside the vault changes people and we can't even trust those we were trapped with for 25 years
---
Not against a viable opponent it doesnt
---
That doesn’t surprise me in the slightest. They literally HAD to do something or the whole community would have burned Bethesda to the ground.
---
Where are the dupers to save us?
---
Added :)
---
SQL?  They probably use MS Access.
---
Yeah I've gotten a full unyielding solar set.
---
SOLAR
---
Yeah Ive only ever sold a bloodied handmade. Other than that Ive made all my caps selling ammo and chems
---
Never thought Beth would have me wishing for more dupers!
---

While Bethesda needs to get their act together, it’s always been an issue that we just haven’t seen because they were single-player games that were never majorly updated after release. This is why so many people were asking for an engine overhaul. It has too many moving pieces to be covered by any sized dev team.
---
Definitely won’t be the end of this game. The community just needs to offer some patience and Bethesda needs to give some charity to its playerbase.
---
That's actually a reasonable solution, just going to need to wait for the other goals to be lowered too (unless they are already)
---
Just checked the site, and it seems they dropped the 0, and changed it 15 million, so far 12.3 million donated.
---
The game technically has no limit but going past 350 Damage Resistance / 375 Energy Resistance will start yielding diminishing returns in terms of how much Defense will protect you from damage so picking up perks that further increase those things is not advisable in my opinion since hitting those Resistance soft caps isn't hard. We're talking about needing to stack an extra +100 Damage Resistance just to take 1% less damage sort of diminishing returns. 
---
The only defensive perks I can fully suggest is Blocker and Fireproof for Defense along side Lifegiver and Rejuvenated for the extra HP.
---
Quest started: Gold fever
---
Not doing it
---
Ultracite ammo does additional damage to everything, PLUS further additional damage to Scorched.  You also produce significantly more Ultracite ammo when crafting, yes, with the downside of needing Stable Flux, which is sort of an endgame crafting material.  But many people sell Flux and Ultracite ammo.  As others have explained, you need to obtain and read the Prime Receiver plan for a weapon to unlock both the mod and the ability to craft that type of Ultracite ammo.  The plans are drops from the SBQ and commonly sold in player vending machines.
---
Right?! What are you gonna use that leather for? I understand the glass, cloth, and steel... but that’s about it imo.
---
Thanks for the explanation, I thought you meant the "personal terminal"
---
PS4 I’m afraid. But thank you kindly!
---
You know the excavators you make at workshops (iron, wood, junk, aluminum, etc), there’s a special kind specific to the converted ammo factory workshop that creates ammo. Well people are using blueprints to get that special ammo producer in their camps somehow. Sometimes as many as 4  at a camp I’ve seen. 
---
I don’t know how they do it, something with blueprinting the converted ammo factory workshop a certain way but you see it a good amount at random camps. Weirdly enough it’s a lot lower mid levels (40s-60s) who have them from what I’ve seen.
---
Ultracite ammo is for guns that do more damage at the cost of never having ammo
---
I don't have fo1st so if I collected everything that I would like to the .1 weight plus the unique weapons would be too much. I take pictures of Easter eggs i have found though
---
This \^\^ You can test this slighty on the social screen. When you click to place a nuke, a window pops up. If your mouse leaves that window, it is supposed to lose control of the selection process. However, instead of doing that, it sometimes locks you into whichever option was selected last. The next issue happens while regaining control of the window with your mouse. You have to move it back into the window, except, the edges don't really refresh the mouse selection. So, you're technically hovering cancel, but the game still has confirm selected. I think it selects both options with a single click. It cancels original placement, but immediately launches wherever you thought the mouse was hovering cancel lol.
---
All this works vice versa. You have perfect nuke placement, move your mouse towards the bottom of the map accidentally, and it both highlights and audibly selects cancel. You move your mouse back to confirm, the window now highlights confirm, but you sometimes won't hear the audible noise of the selection change taking place. If you shake your mouse around, you'll hear and see the change take place. If that makes sense. This \^ is what causes the accidental launches. But I think it also rarely triggers a new placement auto launch which is a lot worse lol.
---
Donating materials could have had a not-too-small of a chance to be rewarded 1 or 2 legendary modules or a 25%, a 50%, a 75%, or a 100% discount ticket when buying from the purveyor.
---
I bought it today, see you in the wastelands, on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday
---
Why don't you try finding a place to camp which has an existing building to use as lodging?  There are plenty of locations able to do this at.  Then you can place as much items as available
---
***EVEN IF!***
---
LOL, I total called that by the time I got home today the bar would be filled 80%! I didn't think of them moving the goal post in the players favor though, figured they would just lie about how much had been turned in.
---
It’s about shortcuts. Recheck all wires and connectors. Make sure you are using as little as possible. They take up so much space and it can easily get away from you. Eliminate all turrets as you don’t need them. It’s cheaper to repair minor damage caused by things chewing on the walls then it costs in your camp budget. There are a bunch of little things that you can remove to make space for the fun filling decor.
---
I think that’s a good sign you’ll like it. If you want the least bias opinion or just enjoy fallout news, JuiceHead is the least bias fallout YouTubed I’ve seen. While Oxhorn offers the best in-depth lore. 
---
You may already know this stuff, but most people are so busy hating the flaws of this game they don’t notice how many details go into a Bethesda project. If only their development quality matched their world building
---
Hey lay off them, Bethesda’s been working real hard on this game man. Didn’t you see they fixed the Wastelanders frame so it shows a rifle instead of a laser musket! Literally nothing in the game was more gamebreaking than that /s
---
That's a kind of bad exploit the ammo economy seems important to me as I get a good chunk of my caps from it and it's not like ammo is so hard to get, I hope there won't be enough of them to flood the market
---
Jus a question, is junkie that good of a build to have? Cus I saw that people were complaining about everyone having a bloodied build and that Bethesda needs to balance the game.
---
Much more realistic goal. Original amount was outrageous
---
Ex-government but ye i hope they have good loot.
---
I would love a pool ! I remember the one in fallout 4 you could build (the place with all the friendly ghouls) , it looked so pretty if you put lights just under the water.
---
How are so far behind on concrete? I know it's easier to get steel but if we can't do concrete which can be extracted how are we going to do cork? Or plastic? I'm picking up every golf ball I can find, but that's not going to be enough
---
I never had 1st either, but my build just makes me a walking stash box so I can spare a few weight. But if your deal is unique weapons then you simply have a different kind of collection which I can certainly appreciate.
---
I do low level pvp.  I Max out at 20 or 30 and then kill my character off and begin again.  I am not one shot ing anyone.  I've taken down 200+ level characters.  It's not that difficult.  I have no op or duped gear.  Just run of the mill items that anyone can get in game.
---
   I lose a lot of fights its ok!  It has improved my gameplay tremendously.  It's fun!  I used to avoid it too.
---
Well yeah lol new world order type people
---
I'm glad you brought up the Brotherhood Of Steel thing, cause I literally cannot hear about them or talk about them without calling them assholes. 
---
They have always been the randomly included faction of assholes in all the fallout games. I think when the games are made somebody on the team(of course someone that has never played Fallout) and they think they're gonna be cool, but there is a fundamental thing with the Brotherhood that makes them definitely not cool. Not cool at all. Fuck the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Is it the same as the Tadpole ones, you only need to complete a certain amount of them to get access to the backpack mods?
---
Also, congrats on completing your challenges!
---
Yes!!! This also happens with the gatling laser and stim packs. Killed me so many fucking times.
---
I think maybe a limited time public event akin to meat week couldve worked, maybe gathering supplies around certain areas and then bringing it to ATLAS and then maybe fighting off some enemies while the bots build wouldve been fun.
---
Yes, if you get bird bones it'll be greatly reduced. You'll lose some strength for bird bones but the carry weight from marsupial more than makes up for it. You'll also get 4/5 extra Agility
---
Only the reddit scum want it without the grind they love pvp but only if they get the kills and they love rng but only if they get what they want after the feel they've tried long enough. Less time whining more time grinding or play a different game (not directed at you obviously)
---
Just checked; in the event description it still says ‘200 million cork’ but they also forgot to change the text from 150 million to 15 million for the Concrete, so I guess we won’t know for sure until tomorrow
---
My "Daily quests" from the Raiders seem to be about every 3 days or so and alternate. So Wren one day and about 3 or four days later Rocksy. Should have my ammo appliance in 5 or six years!
---
The Fallout community is no stranger to bugs/glitches. The community can put up with laggy servers and glitched fast travel. What will eventually kill the community is the lack of meaningful/rewarding/repeatable content and consistent lies, corporate nickel and diming of Zenimax.
---
We need base game content, not new Atom Shop exclusives. We need new quests and farming mechanics that don’t drive players insane in a boring, repetitive grind. We need new interactions and interesting stories to keep players engaged. I don’t want to see another lazy Collectron rekindle in the ship every few weeks. I want to see double sided walls being implemented before gutting the systems that make them possible. I don’t want a refrigerator/freezer I have to pay real world money to get. I want a quest to help Sunny finally get that ice cream all the settlers keep asking about.
---
There’s an easy way to fix all this, but bethesda is too stuck with the games as a service model to ever implement it. Fallout has always been a community game. Give FO76 to the community and let us do the work for Bethesda. Let modders fix the broken coding, let creators design new in game items the community actually wants, let server operators open their own servers on their own systems. Then they can steal the best the PC community has to offer and sell it at a premium to the console plebs like me. It’s a win-win really.
---
Actual BoS event after they have arrived: Rebuild the Alcohol Supply.
---
The only ones you should skip are the kill/revive someone challenges.  The rest you can either do afk, or within like 2 minutes, unmolested.  Though if you have a partner the revive one is super easy, just spawn on a cliff side, jump off, then have your friend hop down and res you, then do the same for them, poof.
---
Kill x monsters:  Spawn in at the jail (up to 3 ghouls in and around the jail) or the Bolton Greens (up to 3 mutant hounds on the grounds).  If you didn't find the number, or you got killed, just log back in.  It doesn't matter if you die, it shouldn't take more than 1-2 load ins, but this one is the hardest of the ones you should bother with, and it's not hard.
---
Gain a rank:  If you have never played NW or are at a low level you literally just need to hit a bush, and afk.  When you die you'll level, because low level characters rank up absurdly quick.  Same strat for the "stay alive x min" ones.  If you aren't trying to fight or win the match, hiding is really very easy.
---
Put down a camp:  Impossibly easy.
---
Use x Stimpack:  Loot any chests you see till you have the number, then run into the fire.  Poof done.  Pick a location close to the fire, people rarely spawn out there anyway.
---
There's no reason to not complete these if you care about score, the only thing stopping people is an irrational hatred/fear of pvp, because 90% of the time you won't even see another person before you complete your challenge and log off.  Make no effort to not get killed, if you do, just relog.  No issue.  I do all of these and it's never hard, the only one I sometimes skip is the killing people one because unless you get lucky it can take too long.
---
Everything.
---
Yeah I did just look onto the site as well after commenting but I think they'll probably do the same for the others, if not right away then, when they are close to being failed
---
If you don't wanna get killed don't go there.  Simple as that.  Oh and your friends are committing suicide by shooting me before I shoot them.  They're basically asking to duel, so I get the opportunity to kill you one by one.
---
I was able to donate 14000 steel between my characters, I’ve only been able to donate 250 concrete. 🙃
---
It's good RN especially for shotguns and heavies because its got that "magic" damage bug. That minigun right there fires fast enough and has the right prefix to trigger it.
---
However after that bug is fixed it will do roughly half the damage of a bloodied build, but with the safety if having 5x the health buffer of course.
---
Take an extra zero of the donation requirements
---
I’m with you, whenever I see them it annoys me. I feel like Bethesda could do a ban/suspension easily enough (I’m not holding my breath tho). 
---
Sometimes I’ll annoy/attack people with them or take their workshops lol. Explosive baits still seems bugged so you could blow them up if you stumble across them
---
no that doesn't effect durability.  I recommend White Knight lvl3 so you are not repairing it too often.
---
The website is updated manually by them so.. we don’t know what we are actually at
---
Somebody may have had the good sense to realize pretending players had turned in 120 million concrete was too obvious, and lowering the bar would look less ridiculous.
---
They can even somewhat reasonably claim the original number was a miscommunication.
---
Have you finished the bucket list mini quest for the camera?
---
just wait for it. I thought the same until recently. I died during an event in my power armor close to the end of the event and it glitched so I couldn't do anything. the camera was spinning with button respawn only it didn't work. the only way was to close the game from task manager and lose all the loot and rewards, thankfully it let me respawn after 5 minutes. Also later today I was stuck in power armor and nothing helped to unequip it. Every second dialogue I engage is bugged and has to be repeated a few times, and sometimes it can break the quest. I don't mean it in the bad way, but just recently I didn't have any problem either until I did..
---
Obviously you can only do mods on private worlds. That means FO1st subscriptions. That means certain money.
---
1. yes.
---
2. It should not. (not 100% on that.)
---
3. like most other rifles?
---
4. Use what you have. You will most likely find the handmade or Fixer a better alternative.
---
It’s only concrete and cork id say was difficult to acquire in large amounts,personally speaking of course. scraper perk and laser rifles works a treat for plastic atleast
---
In theory, if you had people taking any workshop with concrete as a resource, and you had people dropping camps on the nodes to harvest concrete at a steady rate, you could make more of a dent... But people are also working on their progress for the legendary run, so that takes away from the pool of people who might contribute.
---
&gt; i wouldn’t even be surprised if it’s a total charade and we meet the goal regardless
---
I mean - it will be blatantly obviously if they do that.  
---
Though, maybe they'll do it in hilarity.  "we forced donations from banned duppers getting us to the goal"
---
Just play the story and events that’s what I did when I started playing again when I moved to Xbox
---
That's fair, at least when it comes to the scorched side of it. However most people do not go out of their way to kill scorchbeasts aside from challenges. I am not trying to defend the decisions on this challenge (other than lowering the goal), just saying that player disatisfaction with the rewards can't be the only reason.
---
10000000%. I was thinking about this too
---
For the inevitable "Source?"   posts :)  
---

---
But randomness is the absolute height of clever game design. You don't want agency, you want chance.
---
I read about so many bugs that I’ve never encountered and I’ve always just assumed that I play less then others. I can encounter far fewer bugs playing 4 hours a week compared to those that can an hour or more a day. But I have started getting that fast travel bug since the last patch.
---
Oh that's good to know at least as someone said it was 4.25 yesterday and it's 4.65 now lol
---
I have over 50k Concrete, I'm a beta player since the very first PC beta that wiped our installs when we attempted to join the time limited access.
---
I refuse to partake and validate this event, Bethesda has ignored the community with the multitude of problems they have caused, and I do not call promises a fix, they have promised many things and never delivered.  
---
They have totally ignored the lack of rewards for this event, and clearly showcase a total and lack of both care and experience with their own playerbase in the numbers required for this event.
---
How anyone can make excuses for this level of fail is beyond me.
---
You don't need to complete any specific number of them to buy the backpack mods. You could technically get all the possum badges you need from the Stings &amp; Things and Operation Tidy dailies plus Campfire Tales without ever completing a possum challenge. That would be slow going though since getting a badge from the quests is not guaranteed.
---
Also be able to open doors while in build mode!
---
1 day left. also we only got 4 mil after like multiple days, i think it might be too late.
---
Have fun yeah I get it, but literally is it even possible to do this is what they should have asked. Does there exist this much raw ingredients in all players inventory or is even possible to grind out in the short time span? Maybe they forgot that the game is almost a ghost-town?
---
Ah I see see. I’m not sure which guns are good rn. So thanks.
---
Plans have to be learned from notes. They drop from a few places including SBQ fights, holiday gifts, miner pails, and the new BOS donation rewards iirc. Otherwise just look in player vendors. Most of the ones you would want to learn can be purchased for a few caps.
---
Edit: Why are you downvoting this guys question? He clearly is new and the game never says anywhere that there are scrapping only and plan only mods. Be mature and let him ask his questions without pointless downvoted.
---
If you run the Collision Course, it drops 100 Pre-War Money, which are just cloth. Very easy to accumulate if you run that event every time it shows up.
---
Plastic cloth and leather are easily achievable, I have ks in my stash box for those as I am sure others do as well. Cork and concrete are just unrealistic.
---
It’s actually higher, they just reduced the amount of concrete we need to 15mill
---
Food builds!!!!!!
---
Yep. Let's murder those techno-Nazis.
---
1. yes, all rifleman perks work with it.
---
2. yes, damage done is greatly reduced
---
3. pita
---
4. I don't like it in sneak sniper mode, because it's slower than a lever when you want max damage
---
And I bet they change nothing with the events down the road, because Bethesda truly cares for the playerbase they know nothing about.
---
They should've done a better job at it then instead of offering rewards with the same loot table as the massively duped presents.
---
Go ahead and try it out buddy *grinning intensifies*
---
The game is hardly a ghost town
---
The funny thing is, in the world each server is ALL of Appalachia.  So each version of that np, in his universe he is asking like... 20 people to scrounge up millions of units of things within a really small time frame.    
---
My immersion is destroyed.
---
Just get rid of it and make the game how it was.  I'm tired of care bears trying to shove me off into fortnight fallout edition when we all bought the same fucking game and agreed to it's terms.  Workshops are for pvp.  Period.  The extractors just sweeten the pot and make a nice platform for turrets.  I can suggest a million and one better ways to farm.  Ask me.
---
That actually brings up something I've been thinking about for awhile: There's that one person at The Wayward who says 'If Foundation or Crater are gunning for you, let me know' Does this mean we could've originally fucked over both factions/make them hostile then make them Neutral by paying that person off?
---
I hope that isn't just some missed opportunity.
---
I couldn't agree more. This is more of what I'd like to relay in my posts if I wasn't just so frustrated with the issues plaguing my game experience lately.
---
Thank you.
---
Ran radiation rumble today, only one collecting ore from what I could tell. I didnt have any major issues with FR and piles galore throughout.
---
I managed to fire it up again last night and got a hand from a super high level character, he helped walk me through and gave me cover throughout the mission, it was great! Thanks for the pointers and offers to help me out too! I appreciate it!
---
Also, I gotta say the games community is pretty mint, folks seem happy to help out and I haven’t ran into anyone griefing and I’m coming up on over 80 hours in game. It’ll keep me coming back
---
It cuts weight for some items, but also makes unsellable scrap sellable in bulk form. If you horde mats you can make some good caps from selling bulk.
---
They lowered it 15 million! We’re at 12 million right now!
---
Very nice. I'll have to buy those serums next, and buy the recipes the next time I restock my vendors
---
All totals have changed
---
Yeah, not sure that happens? The initial event page still displays 4.65 mil.
---
Its Bethesda thats how. Fix something that doesnt effect gameplay and break the main quest.
---
Absolutely nothing after lvl 50.  They make food builds excited or something I guess.
---
No one seems to be happy with say a 1* Bloodied / Junkies Handmade(which is awesome) it has to be 2525 god tier and they feel they are owed somehow.   Some of these weapons would never drop in 10 years of playing without dupes.  Hell lvl 20’s complain about not having full legendary armor ect....
---
Just to update, they fixed the goal to 15 mil today, that may be achievable.
---
Goes better with the gas mask as it’s intended
---
On my 3rd attempt of this no luck. Nope no luck. Reset must have something to do with it. Bethesda is a joke.
---
In theory it is my favorite BR. But in practice it is poor because they don't develop it.
---
Are you using the contractor perk when you build?
---
Try using oil lamps instead of electric lights.  Saves a few budget points by not need copper wire and connectors.  Power radiators help, too.
---
If you have already completed Crane, delete the sign.
---
Do you have stored items and/or blueprints?  Those take up budget.
---
if you are in the forest, you don’t need 10 turrets and a missle launcher.  Those take up lots of space.
---
you do not need a ton of crops, especially if you have green thumb.
---
If you bought it from the Atom shop, use the thanksgiving display case.  It holds 6 items instead of 4, so you can use fewer of them to display the same amount of stuff.
---
Ya I saw. Wtf.
---
Dope! I'll let you know. I might be able to get back on tonight, but I'm not sure. My gamertag is codysegraves, feel free to shoot me an invite if you see me on!
---
Edit: In the past week, I've gotten 3 from Scorched Earth (completing the event, not from looting the queen), 1 from Bots on Parade, and 1 from Heart of the Swamp
---
Good.  Fuck the #brotherswhosteal and their little atom shop item
---
Most people are.  I suck at pvp, and play no shooty pvp games but I actually enjoy NW after I got used to it.  You really don't even need to try to kill people for it to be fun.  I generally just snipe someone from a billion miles away or kill no one.
---
yeah my Raider Collectron has given me quite a few lead pipes. I have probably got a dozen concrete total from all of them over the past week.
---
So essentially junkies gives you 50% more damage with no real restrictions so you can use it with essentially any build and have full health as well as any mutation you like.    
---
Bloodied itself on weapons gives 100% while also synergizing with nerd-rage adding another 20%, then adrenaline (mutation) adding even more and with unyielding you get up to 75% more melee damage as well as 75 carry wieight and 30% more xp than you would otherwise (+15 to all specials) so generally most of the time you are better off with a bloodied build even if you don't actually use the bloodied effect on a weapon, you could for example go with vampires or instigating, as to survivability, you get perks like serendipity which only works on low health and negates most damage, blocker and fire proof which make you take almost no damage from the specific damage types, so you end up just as tanky if not tankier due to serentipity.
---
Scraper perk cars. I have owned game since beta, took maybe 6 months off but been playing non stop since end of last year. And never used it until like a month ago. Been I never used guns really until I changed my build from bloodied melee to bloodied stealth commando. That and the water fountain at whitesprings for getting rid of diseases. I mean god there is so much that even after two years I’m just learning.
---
Lol so much hate on it, but when the mole miner pails were the weekly event and a small percentage of individuals got the highly sought after items the complaint Layed there, so now we have an event that allows everyone to receive the rewards and the hate remains the same. Yes I fully understand that concrete of all things pry doesnt get hoarded as often as some other items. Given that bethesda should have taken note of the easiest junk to obtain and dished out the requirements accordingly.
---
You know you'll probably get it anyway, right? These community engagement challenges ALWAYS pass, even if goals aren't reached, because failure reflects poorly on the game. 
---
I don't think I've ever seen any game with these kind if things says the fans failed.
---
Cork is gonna be worse lawl.
---
Oh yeah, who knows. As far as saving face goes they did an amazing job with the solution.
---
You're being irrational.  So long as you are ok with that.
---
Ask people that pvp.  Ya boi here has advice for days on not sucking.
---
We were never going to make the concrete total, let alone cork totals. They completely overestimated the amount of concrete and other materials people had.
---
Did they say so somewhere? It seems like they just put all the numbers about the same for each resource regardless of rarity. Had they really crunched the numbers, we should have been needing to get billions of steel rather than millions. Correct me if I'm wrong, but little to no mobs drop concrete. It has to be found in junk that spawns on the map and will not be there if you get it and server hop. It is an inherently more limited grind for some resources than others.
---
wonder if cork will also drop to 20 mil or if they still expect us to gather a cubic shitload of golfballs.
---
Welcome to the dark side
---
I bought all guns and then grinded weeks to get the t65 and have had the game since beginning and never cheated and yeah the fucking gold dupe glitch today is going to ruin it
---
I haven't seen any myself but I'll be sure to angry emote and report them if I do, grr, I don't really like PvP so I'll just stay in my passive mode and be just that to be honest
---
I'd be lost if it didn't.  If only chemist worked too.
---
It looks like the updated it. It now shows 12.53 million out of 15 million. So it looks like our donations were finally updated and the goal was lowered.
---
Wait what the hell? That’s actually insane..
---
Nice. That makes a lot more sense just given the rarity of materials.
---
Edit: where do you see that? I am still seeing 200k on the events page.
---
Without a doubt but sure knock off a zero and claim a typo I guess.
---
Also the Treasure Hunter event involved fighting enemies.  This involves gathering
---
The problem with it is that it's stupid, boring, and clearly the person or persons who came up with the challenge didn't stop to think if what they were asking was actually feasible let alone possible.    
---
Dev for this game a clown show.
---
I've never played the Oblivion mmo but know folks who do. I didn't realize till recently that a whole nother team takes up responsibilities for it. The jump from a single player FO experience to an mmo is huge. I thought the experience from having one already would benefit this one greatly.
---
I look forward to a better wasteland.
---
Imagine being so cheap you have to use a glitch
---
They aint getting my cork either.
---
Where did you get that from?
---
No the problem is the dupers are on to the scheme of getting rid of duped junk so they won't donate
---
This demonstrates hopefully to the entire playerbase that Bethesda only promises they care about the playerbase and only play the game when we are watching.  
---
In practise they care little, do little, promise the world and deliver nothing.  So many things have been promised then gone silent on for months or longer.  So many bugs are pushed to the team, and then never heard from again, so many features are pushed to the team, and never heard from again despite several highly up-voted posts with awards pushing them higher.  This is not even getting into seemingly mind boggling decisions to fix things nobody complains about, yet ignore issues people are up-voting and reporting like crazy.
---
Either this changes and they become interested in the very people that enable 76 to exist by paying and playing this game.
---
Foooooooood buuiiiiiiild hahaha
---
Like my friends children, with Cheerios and the vents in my truck.... drive em one time and no mater how many times I cleaned it I was still finding Cheerios up until I sold it.
---
NW is the only reason to keep running the game. And it's so poor on a technical level.
---
An Enclave agent defending the Brotherhood?
---
This is wild, I'd love to see this in person, the pictures are great but it's so busy I don't think a picture could really do it justice in comparison to in person.
---
Good build fellow wastelander.
---
It makes the cheating they will do to get the target over the line less blatant.
---
You watch. Contribute absolutely nothing at all and we'll still "complete" the event.
---
Well the whole damn event, there just isn't enough stuff over such short periods of time.
---
It looks amazing with the cosmos and to let you know if you got the free states bundle you can build a jet pack for it without buying the plan. I found that out after I bought it all but the helmet and jet pack and wasn’t going to use jet pack and when I was modding the chest it was able to be built
---
No one duped concrete or cork... Doubt there has even been that much concrete available to collect in game
---
what is cork even used to make? why would anyone need it? im genuinely asking.
---
Marsupial, speed demon, healing factor and adrenaline are all low load with good benefit.
---
Fireproof.   
---
After that, offensive perks - the more damage you can do, faster, the less likely you are to take it :)
---
Don't do it.  They will crash choppers on your camp everyday.
---
the 4th and 5th stars currently are not in use, but they are some in reserve that could be turned on. who knows when they will go live though.
---
Yep but i'd rather have a mess in my ammo than dying :D i have often the respawn bug
---
Not enough people is a thing. I am not donating. I knew from the beginning the numbers were ridiculous so I just didn’t participate.
---
All it would have taken is one person who has actually played the game for more then 5hours since launch when on a livestream to look at the rewards and tell them that this would go down like a sweaty ten second fart during a hot date.
---
They are not.  And I hope they never will be.  UNLESS they provide a reason to keep using power armor
---
I think cork is used in some mods, but that’s about it.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Mines always been fucked.
---
Talk to the Scout Leader, he'll ramble some shit. I wait for him to totally finish talking, then interact with him again. During the repeat or next dialogue the quest will appear and I have to enable it from the quests menu, as it'll still be in the background.
---
Ive gotten like two badges in it from 30-40 clears :(
---
It is insane. So you can see why people are somewhat complaining, there is no real reason not to play bloodied and it kind of puts you at a disadvantage, especially with leveling.
---
And just to correct myself the mutation is called "adrenal reaction" specifically
---
Just pvp this junk out of their hands and donate it to your scrap box, or some random low level in your area.  
---
Better use of scrap!
---
The Bethesda website currently says 12.53/ 15 Mill.
---
The grinding wouldn't even be a bad thing if the game itself wanted you to grind the right way. But it doesn't. It's in fact anti-grinding with its hard, mobile games tier timegates all around it to prevent grinding. So in essence they made a grinding event in a game they made from ground up to NOT be about grinding. It wasn't really thought out well, really.
---
My page says 12.3 million of 15
---
I’m currently working on my camp. The spawn seems to be in my water farm. Do I need to change my camp to help the travelers? I want it to be cool when they land.
---
The best part of this event was when i saw grahm visit the observatory.
---
I sure the hell ain’t using the glitch. I grinded for months to get all gold legit. Half the time smiley didn’t give me gold. I kept all 1000 gold from raiders and settlers so I could get everything I wanted. All I’ve bought was mini gun shotgun pistol and plasma then all secret service armor not the helmet and bought under armor after they added the mods and then didn’t get nothing until I said screw it and slowly bought the t65 being it’s the best tank. The cosmos skin on it makes it look amazing and doesn’t have the big hole looking part when it doesn’t have paint on it
---
Honestly? This is a good move. It's appreciated.
---
I'm sure some people will still find a reason to complain, though.
---
I have gotten streaks of bloody weapon drops.
---
lol.  It will just give them another thing to sell to you in the atom shop for 5 bucks. 
---
Oh, and the auto complete bug is not fixed.  I still lose 2 weekly challenges every week.  Not just visually, they are completed.
---
He just plain botched it. It is clear as day.
---
2 mil in 1 day is still doable, considering an average 4 mil / day got donated so far.
---
Maybe the thing is covered in fetid gore. Or maybe it’s been covered in poop, a shit covered robot could lead to infections.
---
NO!  Saying shit like that is just gonna get the pvp community punished again!  THEY WILL NERF EVERYTHING!
---
No. Maybe the intern took another day off 🤷‍♂️
---
Thanks but not quite the problem I am having =)
---
What happens to me is when I get near the quest markers to pick them up they disappear.  So then I server hop and they move and I run to them again and just as I get close they disappear.
---
Gotta hard-refresh browser screen (CTRL-F5) to see the new count on concrete...and 8m of concrete magically appeared...
---
Just a shame. People want free content, more content, less work to get content, fix old content, make better atomic shop items and stop making them cost so much.
---
I totally get there are things that need to be improved. Some useable gear could be a result of clear progression rather than RNG, we could use more endgame content that’s just for fun rather than to become stronger like a faction wars mode or expanded team TOWNS bldg like has been suggested.
---
But I just don’t see how Bethesda or us gain anything by spending time on here complaining about a game we think is so trash?
---
Why would properly playing a sniper make you scum. You're not one of the hackers floating in the sky punching people to death instantly. Those people are the real scum.
---
Power plants have level 3 terminals outside to access the shortcuts
---
Man if someone had a work around for this one i would happily send them a strippergram
---
You want to make this event farmed hardcore?
---
1% drop chance for the Elder Maxon Battlecoat. 
---
DONE.
---
I think we have probably seen enough at this point haven't we?  They can't fix or don't care to fix a lot of major bugs, even when they say they are fixed they aren't, and in the mean time they break things people care about.
---
Yeah, I know. Maybe those people don't play long enough or actively, I have no other explanation. I don't think bugs are that different on other platforms.
---
Same and I still don’t know where it is, though I don’t want to give away all my goods to some buffed up jerks.
---
So, they cut it by 90%, bet they end up doing the same thing with cork.
---
Funny they only overestimated by 10x. I wonder how much they’ll lower the cork goal.
---
Faschnacht collectron finds prewar sweets and booze, sometimes empty bottles.
---
Demolition perk helps it also, as gauss has built in explosive.
---
did you refresh it?
---
I donated 7,000 steel and 1,000 concrete so far.  I did get some ok plans but nothing amazing.  Then again I would wonder where Dorsey got something like sat a serum recipe or a rare plan.  Where did I get all that steel?  Scrapping weapons from Line in the Sand ...
---
Yeah, but a realistic version where Santa only has enough time to visit the rich kids.
---
I feel the same way
---
Brotherhood: we'll need 150 million pounds of concrete.
---
76ers: that's insane.
---
Brotherhood: did we say 150 million?  We meant 15.
---
Defo it was this or realistically they'd have to give us the crap for doing it anyway. Wouldn't look too good if failed.
---
Surface camps require server resources. Instanced camps with only a door on the surface take up far less. I expect a push will be made close to the time.
---
Ya truthfully i have a hard time with my gauss rife, i have a nice lever action i take out and about and i also  have my fixer...u use the chineese stealth armor still so i would recommend sticking to what works for you have fun!!!
---
If it’s like wasteland then you can shoot them but won’t die, you just blood splattering everywhere.
---
Ha
---
Bethesda just updated the requirements to a lower, much more reachable amount, but I don’t have the link info handy atm.
---
I'm really impressed by this.  No fudging the stats.  No ignoring the ridiculous target.  Just readjusting to realistic expectations.
---
Don't keep more than 100 of anything you don't use for ammo.  Simple as that.  Once you've upgraded your vault suit gold scrap is just pure money.  Food related perks are trash.  Weight reduction perks are only good in terms of ammo if you use automatics/big guns.  Non legendary weapons can be scrapped to learn mods.  That is all.
---
i mean the foundation and crater folks dont lift a finger either. i think this just proves when the BoS arrives they'll do the same.
---
which also means nukes wont destroy or kill them, they'll just put on magic hazmat suits and go abiut their buisness.
---
I wonder if they're saving them as stopgaps for when players start getting board.
---
They've just updated the target on the event site to 15 million concrete instead of the previous 150 million.
---
We are now almost at the target! O_O
---
Fair enough. I just know there's a fairly common opinion in the community of not approving of doing things that only having Frog Legs allows you to do.
---
And thankfully I'm on Xbox and don't have to worry about actual hackers
---
Still shows 150 Mil for me.
---
Not sure how to do that on mobile.  Well the numbers for concrete were not updated in 2 days
---
refresh your page
---
I imagine the RNG for 5 star weapons would be fucking insane, I'm kind of hoping if they ever use it the 4th and 5th legendary slots can be customised rather than being randomly generated. Or hell, when the day comes that Bethesda sunsets the game we get the final update that just says "fuck it" and turns on 5 star enemies and lets people go nuts with some OP gear.
---
Oh that's great! Thank you! I was a really low level when i did the first nuke so I got help. I really didn't do much lol. Hence my ignorance about it. Thank you very much!!
---
It’s both. It’s definitely both.
---
Resource grinds are a terrible gameplay loop and should never have been considered. It would have made way more sense from both a thematic and design point of view to have the community scavenge for rare tech and technical documents for rewards instead.
---
Ok just asking because its stuck at 4.65/150 for me since the first day
---
Bethesda is leading us to Whitespring where they're gonna nuke us all.
---
Lightweight armour I believe.
---
dirt floors won’t kill them
---
Oh shit well that's a new one. Apologies mines just insanely hard to trigger the start of. We all get our different bugs it seems....
---
Yes for some reason it’s not updated for me. I’ll try and clear my cache
---
I have had at least 5 games where I had 5 codes but never could find a case and I even invested in the perk card for briefcase locator and only once it showed up but dead before I could get it
---
Still think it's gonna be hard press to get 3 million by tomorrow.
---
You need alot of caps.
---
for those who haven't seen, the goal is being reduced to 15 million
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423145/fortifying-atlas-concrete-goal-update
---
&gt; The goal wasn't the problem.
---
Actually, the results are proving you wrong.
---
Steel - had the same reward.  The goal was easily met.
---
Conrete ?  Nope.  
---
So - it's 100% the availability of the item in stashes / ability to farm it.
---
I can farm 1k steel in ... 20-30 minutes?  How fast to farm 1k concrete?
---
Oh you mean ESO? Yah, it was a mashup of random subsidiary employees of Zenimax(who owns Bethesda game studio). Now they have about 250 employees and their only job is running all their subsidiary companies and improving that game. For comparison, Bethesda has double that staff, but they have at least 3 active games, a few more that are being handled sporadically like Skyrim, and 2 in development. F76 is completely new ground for Bethesda and most don’t remember that ESO was universally panned and almost went under. Now they have about 3x Fallout’s userbase when they were struggling to keeping even a couple thousand players online at one time.
---
Between this being their first mmo and everything that’s happened this year, I’m personally impressed by this game and Bethesda doesn’t like giving up on their big name IP’s, especially since Todd Howard was backing this idea so hard.
---
Nah mate, imo Bethesda banked on their loyal fan boys &amp; gals just being appreciative of anything they put out.
---
The loading screens for every minor interaction is beyond cringe! I remember Tony hawks on ps1 bragging about no loading screens 20 years ago lolz.
---
I'm on mobile it came up with the old numbers first but changed with a refresh.
---
Don’t know why you got downvoted for giving solid advise. 
---
I have on all three of my characters, all are different builds.
---
Cooking the books lads, lol.
---
Engine is the wrong word, but the banner just doesn't look good
---
Still don't care.
---
It should be up to the individual, that way those that do give a shit can take part.
---
I cleared my cache and got it your title says cork though.
---
Refresh the page
---
Ha.  Good luck with that since they removed the glitches.  You might get that done by this time next year.
---
It will be the MK2 of GTA V equivalent.
---
&gt; Honestly, how much of that steel was already in players' stashes? I don't even farm for stuff, and I have like 8k steel vs. probably 150-400 of anything else (except wood and lead).
---
It's both.
---
I donated 60k steel.  Since that date - I've farmed 40k more.  In theory, I could have donated 20-25k of that as well.  None of that was intentional farming - just a by product of doing west-tek runs &amp; my general loop.
---
Concrete?  I've added maybe 50 to my stash in that time.  All from Uranium Fever.
---
OH i know it's at 12 million, i am saying it might be too late since concrete is so slow to get.
---
Thats bad luck but picking the piece you want is too OP and would be pretty boring.
---
https://imgur.com/FEyVJkS
---
Here you go.
---
Awesome!! Thank you!!
---
once you complete wastelanders, you can trade them in at a bullion machine for gold bullion. the bullion is then spent at the vault for good guns and plans
---
Apparently it’s updated now. They also changed the target to a more reasonable number.
---
I got a bunch to make shielded raider under armor.  I think lightweight mods use it too.
---
By the sound of it they're building a whole complex with the amount of concrete they "need."
---
It is almost like a community of people are made up of  DIFFERENT people with DIFFERENT ideas. What an amazing concept!
---
Reminds me of howl's castle
---
You going to update the post now?
---
I decided on my 3rd alt to get to 50 before doing any story quests by only completing events. I had the benefit of a double xp weekend to help, but also the public groups. Always pick a building group for intelligence since it increases xp earned and do every event you can find, especially in the forest region.
---
I'm almost never able to get the score for completing 5 dailies.  I just stop progressing at 4 and they don't acknowledge my support tickets, if the site doesn't time out before I can send them.  Beginning to wonder if that's intentional.
---
Lul...
---
eh, 12 mil in three days, i dont think its impossible to get another 3 in one. gonna be a grind tho. and tbh with the modified goal i see bethesda fudging the number to just give it to us is more likely. jumping from 4 mil after two days to complete 150 mil in four would be suspicious, now its way more believable.
---
Pc :o
---
What butt guy said
---
Cash em in for gold bullion, there are exchange machines at Foundation and Crater.  Use them to buy secret service stuff from Vault 79, other items from Samuel in Foundation, and probably some other deal with someone in Crater.
---
And someone in charge of their armory who'll buy ammo.
---
no?  It's still at 4.65 million out of 150 million needed as of 6:38 pm EST.
---
I suspect that 90% of concrete donated so far has come from reserves that players just happened to have on hand.
---
Personally, I had a combined total of 600 concrete on the two characters I play the most, and one of them is the character I started at launch.
---
Concrete is surprisingly scarce in the game, it's going to take concerted effort, fudging the numbers, or some combination of the two to make up the difference between now and tomorrow.
---
Thanks for clarifying that. i thought I was seeing things. Is it me or is it totally suss that in less than 12hrs it has gone from 4mil to 12mil considering concrete weighs a shit tonne, is rare and there is only so much out there for FO1st peeps to horde (which IMO shouldnt be made to feel anything towards donating any more than 250 concrete to get one reward to say they participated)
---
Well obviously the amount collected increased. They hadn’t updated in 2.5 days. I’m glad the target is a more reasonable number.
---
Honestly though.. the community amount for rarer materials should be less. I had 1000-1500 steel laying around, and was no problem to donate a bunch. But 200 hours of playing and i kept most, if not all of my concrete.. i only had like 300-400. Which is only 1 donation. Also i'm pretty sure it's one of the heavier junk items. So there is no way we can reach this goal if anyone is like me.
---
Until I got on reddit didn’t even know why specific legendary builds were such a big deal. I was 87 and perfectly happy with my troubleshooter gear lol. Think it’s a result of Bethesda not having a place in-game for people to help each other or chat. 
---
Seems like most people come on here cause they have a question or concern and at some point that just becomes an echo chamber for other’s thoughts. It’s a lot easier to think there’s 100 problems when 100 people are all telling you their own concerns.
---
Or that everyone realizes how dumb this whole thing is and did it once for steel and logged until patch 22
---
You really think Bethesda thinks anymore? 
---
They lost all their brain cells while making Skyrim
---
Kind of confused here, did you read my post? I don’t have any issues with what happened, I’m asking about the mechanics.
---
That’s an odd ingredient, I rarely take the time to cook much beyond grilling the occasional rad stag steak.
---
Came across “Thee Observer” rank 1058. I didn’t think that was even possible
---
Did we get the BOS beret ?
---
I think he likes to go by mr. Mcstuffins
---
Inv link?
---
You can also die instantly because of poison or fire damage.
---
U can always drop em
---
Fuck the Brotherhood, I've got ghoul friends. Plus, my scrap is mine that's why I paid for first. Also un-"fix" our walls...
---
Ah yes thank you, I totally butchered the name of it. Well hopefully they'll take a step in that same direction and get this game back on the right path.
---
i think treasure hunter still wins, we at least had hope then, when you have hope and its crushed it is worse than when you know there is no hope
---
Here is the link to an up to date picture for you.
---
I just checked and it’s out of 15 mil! I’m from the uk (though I doubt that’d change it), maybe refresh the page again?
---
WE DID IT!!
---
Alright, I'm sold on this being my alternative unless Plasma Caster is just heaps better whenever I get my hands on it.
---
Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Bethesda’s actions over the last 2 years remind me of of how i acted going through my Antidepressant post acute withdrawal syndrome. ALWAYS perplexed. I’d be calling Dr. Phil
---
I take it you never filter to "new posts"?
---
They can't even be consistent in bugs =)
---
Gah *shakes fist at sky* damn you, Todd Howard.
---
Not gonna be easy, but people who actually try to farm it, might can get enough. Organically not gonna happen. I had like \~90 cement scraps before this phase started, I picked up every cement bag I came across since and now I have like almost 120. Still not enough for one donation.
---
It is up to the individual. You get super rate provision box beer and plans
---
I dont mind the quests, but I think t should have been more achivable goals, like 145.000 of each thing. Its just more pausible.
---
By all the downvotes I get for just mentioning PvP most of the time, I def know.
---
I started an alt fir this and now im stuck because the main quest is broken. Thats why im boycotting. Its not the rewards its the poss poor job they do fixing the game. 1 fix breaks 10 things. They dont even bother trying the updates when the release them. Hours or data offline because a fix broke everything.
---
Apparently no matter what I write the die-hard fanboys will just disagree and downvote anyways. So much for an honest question in hopes of some others insight. Not gonna bother with this post anymore.
---
Happens to me probably more than 50% of the time when doing this quest now. Usually have to quit the game completely and then the waste will be there. Before patch 21 it used to vanish maybe once every 20 times.
---
Just got 3 in a row so it’s still there
---
To the sweaties that shoot me for standing on the fence, you wouldn't care if you carried less food and did more damage😂
---
What’s wrong with pvp?
---
Already did.
---
They also extended the event through the 18th although idk if thats including the cork
---
We have candy
---
This is really the only logical position to take. You either want the game to fail or you want it to be given back to the community. Bethesda outlined their intent with the series in FO4. Release the base game and several large DLCs throughout its lifetime and let the community do the rest. The official twitter still promotes community mods every week.
---
Bethesda has a great model. Make the base sandbox and initial quest, then let the community run wild. You want the Enclave in the Commonwealth, great, hop on the nexus and grab it. You want Thomas the Tank Engine deathclaws, same thing. You want a entirely second game, this group of modders just took you to Miami.
---
Iirc FO76 is currently being worked on in their Austin studio. The newest, least experienced of their studios. Zenimax has clearly moved resources away from 76, the team is struggling to keep up with compounding issues. The reason is that Bethesda got tired of just making money off of the base games and what DLC content they were able to put out. Where is the next steam of revenue? Games as a service. Then you can sell cheap knock-offs of what the mod community could have come up with and revamps of old assets.
---
The game isn’t bad, the developers are doing their best, the problem lies squarely with the larger corporation. I get that the new Elder Scrolls is taking a while, that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice the quality and exploit the player base of another franchise to keep the company afloat.
---
I can do cork, cus its easier to get than concrete. also a lighter junk item.
---
Maybe if i didnt have to pay for a scrap box i would be able to have the amount of junk they asked. But they keep saying they are playing this game all the time.. i dont believe that at all. Plus if all of the devs obviously have fallout 1st, it's gonna be different for them. Most people cant afford or are willing to buy that shit, especially during covid.
---
CORK FOR THE CORK GOD!!!
---
Don't forget the shitty "250" requirement. The rewards are complete garbage, why not just make the requirement a nice and simple "100"? More people would be willing to sacrifice some concrete but *that* and the banner being quite awful looking? No wonder it fails, I hope the double Score one passes or 'passes' as I'd like to just get the Legendary Run over with and take a break
---
It's Reddit, here downvoting is the only power people have xD Don't bother with it, but I'm with you on this.
---
Yeah, the pace in fallout 4 is just soooo mind numbingly slow compared as well.
---
There are definitely some things like faction wars, heavily personalized armor/outfits, cool instanced housing that I hope they take some direction from.
---
Hahahaha you know what I mean.... Let's those chasing the berets and guaranteed tetanus flags have inventories inundated with useless shit! :)
---
I found mine uncorked its stupidity when I 'joined' a team mate doing hers. I made sure I waa talking to her at the same time so I could see what she was doing too. Mine was bugged as a player handed theirs in first (we both happened to do it at the same time) before I did 'locking' me out.
---
You're doing PvP in a PvP mode. What about that makes you an asshole? You're just being creative.
---
The most unfortunate aspect of this, in my eyes, is that this event LOOKED amazing, conceptually. Bring the dwellers of Vault 76 together to actually help rebuild and maintain a piece of Appalachia, just like all the dwellers believed was the goal of the vault to begin with. Then we saw the amounts required for each goal.
---
My disappointment honestly isn't even about the lackluster provision rewards, or how frustrating the grind is when everyone now has to fight over the same few spaces to loot very specific resources. It's about how Bethesda Austin came up with a great idea to bring the community together for one common goal, and proceeded to turn the entire ordeal in to a time-wasting slog. We have enough to grind in 76 as it is, with only so few efficient ways to do so - not every new piece of content needs to add more grind to the pile.
---
I only have chest piece plan and am running a bloodied sneak build. Today, after many attempts, I got an Unyielding, +1 Intelligence, Harder to detect while sneaking chest piece. I'm happy. My other armor are all scout armor (unyielding, +AP refresh, sneak). Also shadowed on the scout cause it works now. Weapons are handmade, fixer, lever (all bloodied 25/25). Still learning the bloodied life though.
---
This is such a great idea, I'd appreciate it.
---
Thanks for the tip, I didn’t know that you can farm plans this way! I totally agree with you that it’s not the most efficient way to get resources, and was just capturing them for events/achievements. Might be fun to try my hand at defensive PvP there once I get a little stronger too.
---
Nuke silo
---
I have more cork than concrete.  You have to kill thousands of ghoul plumbers to get concrete.
---
As I explained if you're in a workshop as the aggressor or defender, pacifist is off.  There is no pacifist in a workshop.
---
Better rewards in the provision boxes.
---
I can confirm, it's still there. Got a LL uny ss earlier.
---
first time i played fallout 3 i had no idea what a death claw was when i finally ran into one it just ran over and did it little leap attack and instantly killed me and scared the fuck out of me
---
I dont know...kinda on the fence here....I mean...
---
I'm all about building camps and showing off...but... are the vending machines gonna be inside? If so, they most likely lost my caps....I am not gonna go inside someone's house just to see their low level crap for sale.
---
Hopefully they leave the outside buildable too
---
I did refresh, and try another browser.  Maybe the Enclave doesn't want me to know how close we are now?
---
Honestly, every time i see a scorched crack, i know he is carry his plumbing tools and has cork as well. Kill them first so i dont forget.
---
See, they listen!
---
Seeing people complain about Frog Legs on here a lot, combined with getting an XBOX message from some guy accusing me of hacking(lol), made me believe this would be a pretty looked down upon thing to do
---
UK too and 15million is showing for me too.  
---
Still I wish since they can hotswap things, they would throw in better rewards, even perhaps a few skins or something unique but rare would be awesome.
---
Still not gonna donate.
---
Seeing as after 1600 hours of play and I only have 500, I’m guessing I do 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I feel like one thing people need to remember with this sort of event is not everyone has ALL the plans. And hell, most of us who do probably bought them cheap because the market was saturated by dupers. New players still deserve a way to unlock that shit legitimately though. Plus, pandemic. So let's assume that they leave in all the plans that are there and they didn't really have more time to dedicate to this event. The simplest answer probably would have been just to move the technical data rewards into the loot pool. I get some players would complain that they had to unlock them the hard way but I imagine most players just don't have them and it's thematically appropriate. On top of that add lunchboxes to the loot pool, maybe treasury notes (hell, even 1 treasury note would be decent if you're grinding them out) or add a weekly repeatable challenge for SCORE connected to it. Hell it makes no sense logically but maybe even one of them vault tec supply boxes from the SCORE challenge.
---
I own fallout first.  I have unlimited junk space so I grab every single thing that isn't nailed down.  And I never use concrete. So I assumed that I would have at least 2k concrete. 
---
I had around 500.   That convinced me that concrete is not a very abundant resource.  And like I said, I have actually farmed concrete since this started. I have been hitting the concrete hot spots and they have had zero concrete. 
---
I have no concrete and I can't find any to donate.
---
Well there is a day left
---
My guess is they'll alter the required numbers going forward, apologize for creating such lofty goals, and give out the banner anyways. This is a horrible look for them, to have such a fast drop-off from the community. Any amount of goodwill earned in their response would be beneficial, at least in the short term.
---
They just equipped 90% reduced event goal perk card. Well played Bethesda.
---
It is absolutely low maintenance, which works great for me.
---
I haven’t donated yet so I’ll cycle through my characters tonight.
---
Not just weight, but double mineral node gathering. Sometimes an extra node or two will get thrown in there as well. So if you've been playing this game since Beta you know where all the juicy nodes are and you've got a steady stock of acid. Bullet farming is an easy breezy no hassle affair- unless you're lazy or pressed for time.
---
This sums it all up I was was planning on donating some wood cause there's nothing else to do with it, but that's it, I donated 10k steel to see what it was all about but now I know Bethesda can go whistle for my junk
---
Don't know if anyone pointed this out, but they divided the total needed by 10.
---
It's now 15M.
---
I don't plan to as well.  I need all that I can get so that I can rebuild my camp everything something camp related gets fixed.
---
Supposedly future content
---
its the meat piles
---
Where can i find this chart
---
Because Bethesda cares deeply about your engaging with their product, just not enough to actually make it engaging. 
---
Says a lot really.
---
People seem to think nuclear winter is a viable option and that we should just leave them alone in workshops.  Also, vats is broken and team mechanics are practically nil.  Your teammates can't defend with you unless they do the tag/tag back bs like 1v1 and the aggressors teammates have the same issue
---
Damage bugs plague shotguns, especially if they have the explosive legendary effect. Other players know a lot more about it than me so I won’t even try to explain it. From my personal experience, its either use VATS or empty your entire clip to kill a chicken.
---
I've noticed similar. Also seems like scorched killer receiver is busted. It doesn't just do a less damage to non-scorched it like does say 100 dmg then the target recovers 90.. super glitchy and annoying.
---
It would be great if the NPC fan ends up dead if the event fails
---
I did.  I didn't get any results when I posted.
---
They took out all the fun leaving out all the rare plans or atleast coming up with new plans. Like even just a different plan for a different color of beret would had been interesting
---
Considering the total hadn't been updated in multiple days, I doubt it's as "magically" as you think.
---
Yes. I have used her for farming tips
---
I have an instigating gauss rifle that I use on my sneaky sniper. 
---
If you like getting headshot/crits in the 2K range, this is the way to go. It is useless against the SBQ.
---
I only recently started using VATs with it. I've been just FPS sniping with it for almost two years. The gauss rifle suffers the same problem as bows with VATs. The same work arounds apply.
---
They changed the total needed to 15M
---
Enter Bethesda fudging the numbers because they overestimated how engaged the comunity would be with this event... again.  I'm looking at you treasure hunter event.  Now if the had used a different loot pool or thrown in some new stuff I'm sure things would have gone better; but they didn't which makes it seem this was geared toward newer players who are not going to have much scrap to donate.
---
This Discord server has a role you can join to get a notification when people start up an Encryptid event, along with all the other events plus Grahm sightings.
---
https://discord.gg/uwQMme
---
The quest markers only disappear once you throw 1 dross through each tire.
---
No problemo!
---
Yes, and only shotguns with certain effects will let you one shot most things in vats.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Jeez I use plastic to make shotgun shells for my weapon and I’m always struggling to find any. I hoard and buy any I can find. 
---
And yes I purchase shells when I can but as of late I hardly find shells in vendors. If I get lucky enough I find them for 2 caps a piece. 😕
---
They definitely need modern couches and bear proof trash cans.
---
I just noticed that too. 12.5m of 15m achieved
---
Seems they changed the goal to 15 million without telling anyone?
---
Xbox?
---
I still agree with the sentiment that it was an attempt to empty duper's stashes of junk.
---
Okay thanks, I’m starting to think if you have a Unyielding piece you’re trying to replace, it won’t give you another until you scrap the one you have already. I don’t know
---
Ok good. That’s what I thought lmao. I’m like level 120 and I was gonna be APPALLED if I didn’t know that.
---
Cus they wanna force us into a pve grind fest for bullion
---
It's because he's a bitch.
---
Yes, I feel like everyone uses shotguns now. Popular like the 5.56. I sell all my ammo for 1 cap so I’d never pay more than that for any.
---
Wow, I told someone else they had made the stupidest comment in here. I stand corrected.
---
Don’t worry about that dude; he/she was one of the people that got all high and mighty about dupers after the ban wave.  The comment prolly has something to do with that.  To quote one of his/her previous comments, “fuck em.”
---
Didn't know about them as I haven't watched any videos actually about the game, everyone else just hates on it, so appreciate the info
---
Now works, took some time for me, thanks!
---
Not gonna argue. I rarely ever pvp
---
This used to not be a problem.
---
Now you have to press enter rather than the on map button to make sure it is on target.
---
I can't remember which patch exactly added this bug. Had to have been late 2019 or very early 2020.
---
I reported it very soon after they added the bug. Either they can't figure out how to easily fix it without removing some feature they added. Or they don't actually play the game they made.
---
They lowered it to 15m and we are almost there
---
They just changed the goal to 15 million were currently at 12.5 million.
---
It doesn’t matter if you contribute. The other 100k+ players will donate. Success of an event doesn’t mean numbers are cooked.
---
Hi there. Encyptid can be tough when no help is at hand. I had to take all three pylons the other day but I did score a spare Fixer plan. I'm also on PC so if you get stuck, drop me a note and we can work something out.
---
im happy with butt guy
---
Is there a list of unsellable scrap but sellable scrap in bulk form somewhere?
---
I'm a classic order and my 1st Stashbox is chalk full of items
---
Possibly, though dupers don't usually bother with scrap; legendaries are much more valuable especially if it's a legacy.
---
Ok, I was going to do a fusion core run tonight. Im not desparate on ammo as I have 12k 5mm, so instead ill make shotgun shells. Ill dm you tomorrow and sell them to you at .25 C a piece. Sounds good?
---
Looks like Bethesda adjusted the total amount required for the event.  Now it's 15 million.
---
We are going to make it fellas, now over 12 million! We are getting the banner after all.
---
I saw another friendly Mole Miner, apparently stocking stuff. Must be one of her employees.
---
Wait...possum badges potentially drop from those Daily quests???
---
Yup. I think it’s stocking stuff? Kinda cute to see it shuffling around.
---
Is it me or does the concrete goal now say 15 mil?
---
Haha yes it does
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423145/fortifying-atlas-concrete-goal-update?language%25255B%25255D=en&amp;language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en
---
Oh my god, who the hell cares dude. This is fallout. Not camp simulator 76. Tired of hearing people bitch nonstop about camp budget. If they increase the camp budget for everyone then the game is going to run and perform even worse than it already does.
---
This was me until I died in a queen fight by getting knocked into the fissure.
---
I also quit playing
---
I started playing again with first tho
---
A minor tip, you don't even have to move it, just rename it to something else. I have an ini for mods and an ini for NW and I just swap them back and forth depending what I'm gonna play.
---
this is great and definitely a step in the right direction. I just hope they do something similar for cork
---
Build the same.  Food and weight cards are trash unless you're in PA without shocks.  Everyone needs bloody mess, starched genes and class freak.  Yep.  All the same.  It's a game about killing so be good at killing.  As far as side arms are concerned pick one that doesn't need any/many perk cards.  Gamma and chainsaw don't use perks.  A good legendary shotgun can get away with using one of each tier damage card.  A deathclaw gauntlet can get by with none.
---
Same and I had 7.....just finished a new camp but thought I had enough for at least one donation 🤷‍♂️
---
Just speed run through every main mission and side mission. Do some easy events along the way. I’m currently getting my third character to level 50 and after about 4 or 5 days I’m level 40 now. And I’ve completed the main story up until launching a nuke and completed almost every side mission. Aside from the ally ones. Now I’m gonna do the wastelanders DLC to finish off my last ten levels to 50.
---
I'd say the mole miner event is still worse, if only because you HAD to be in the Ash Heap to participate, and still have no guarantee of even finding one of the special miner enemies. Not only is the concept of Fortifying Atlas way cooler, but you can theoretically just play the game, pick up scrap, and donate when you can.
---
Obviously certain junk is harder to come by, so that "theoretically" part remains theoretical for a good amount of these challenges. But, in concept (and BARELY in execution; the community and story aspect pushes it above miner event for me), I think Atlas has the edge.
---
UPDATE! They lowered the required concrete amount to only 15m and we're almost there😁😁😁
---
Bethesda.net/events
---
I suggest blocker, fire proof (very important), barbarian if you have high strength and evasive in case of high agility if neither of those are at or close to max just get ironclad, another good one is lone wanderer in case you don't use teams as it has general damage reduction
---
As I don't know your specials I'd say blocker 3, fire proof 3 and ironclad 5 which puts you at 11 so you got some spare points
---
I will give ammo and fusion cores for each karen/daren killed. Its a bounty on their heads.
---
This is awfully familiar. There's something funny about the developers overestimating their playerbase because it usually ensures one or two things, usually both:
---
**1:** The developers think they have more active players than they actually do
---
**2:** The developers don't play the game enough and don't realize how things actually work.
---
I'd say this is a case of both.  The developers probably overestimated how many people were actually playing this event, and the developers don't realize how uncommon concrete is, which is something they'd know if they played the game with any sort of frequency.
---
Yeah, but the chance seems real low.
---
This is an event? Didn't know because nothing ever tells you to go there unless you listen to the radio, which I don't. And I've only ever done this 2x and gave up because there is no point; why waste any resources only to get crappy items. So, I barely play the game now, only to do daily challenges.
---
Sure my gt is texasMeg
---
AHAHAH
---
"bethesda wont fudge the numbers"
---
It’s not that they don’t want to listen, it is my belief that’s the best they can come up with this game engine. They need to change the engine so they can come up with events not based on grinding.
---
If there's a reputation system, then maybe!
---
Unfortunately you probably won't be able to do their questline if they're hostile. Also I think Bethesda have planned a lot of content around the BoS (those expeditions and daily ops).
---
Wait blueprints take up budget? I have a blueprint for quickly setting up workshop defenses and things
---
Then play 4
---
This month I jumped on the 1st bandwagon because I’m in the mood to play and thought I would start grinding out this campaign. Went on private server and took over Abandoned Bob Town and the 3 pits to farm. Hours later, not even a full 1k. This is not possible to complete when it’s not easily scrapped like steel is. Glad I’m just doing month by month because between that and my farming legendaries today that yielded nothing but 1 and 2 star junk from 3 star legendaries, I’m pretty irritated. Since the beginning, I have yet to get a TSE whatever from anything, ever.
---
If I were an artist for bethAustin I would put the cork texture on the giant power armor statue and sell it for like 6 hours after the event. Costs like 2k cork to build 🤣🤣🤣
---
Did they say it was as big as wastelanders?
---
Little details like this I love finding in the Fallout games
---
Thank you....
---
He's going to give them a room full of corks and there going to think he's crazy then tell him they need him to gather scorched beast guano about 150 mill should be enough when he comes back covered in blood and shit with the guano there going to initiate him then we are going to join with him then outrank him cus we bring the bos some dumb tech (t-65) that we all have when all 9000 of us are officers in the bos he will finally get what he deserve jail for being a stingy fuckbag that duck said for the last 3 days he needs 150m now all of a sudden its 15m lol he's ripping us off and giving the bos 10 percent then keeping the rest
---
They hadn't updated it from 4 million in 2 days, so the 4 to 12 was two days of additions.
---
If that was the plan, it wasn’t very well thought out. The list includes cork but not screws, lead, or ultracite. They focused on the complete wrong resources if they wanted to clear dupers stashes.
---
You may be right and the plan was to whittle down large stash stockpiles, but if it was, it just goes to show how out of touch they are with the community.
---
PvP community is already being punished. No survival mode, assassin hard nerf, major reduced caps. Empathy can buff his team but be invincible so long as she/he doesn't attack in combat. Also they can heal and revive [ devs know but about the Support loophole don't care cause " No one PvPs according to Hines] it sucks that they pitched the game with having this robust PvP but it got nerfed into nuclear winter. So I feel like we're being punished.. for what I dunno. Wanting PvP in a spin off fallout universe game- not a Proper Fallout game.
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
I wonder if the BoS will just toss him aside despite his massive contribution to their cause. He was their bitch and has no further use.
---
There are only two locations with a meaningful amount:
---
(1) Top of monorail elevator access to train
---
(2) Abandoned big town tall brick building 2nd floor 
---
....and still server hopping would be required to get 250
---
I've always hated the Brotherhood anyways. They ain't getting any of my shit.
---
I have but it still shows 150 for some reason.
---
Ok, ill message you with how many shells tomorrow. Shouldnt be too bad, most i made of 50 in one night was 10k, i dont expect this to be much different.
---
Stuff like this is part of what makes Fallout so great. There's loads of scenes like this all over the map that are never reference in any way, they're just little glimps into what was going on in the world. Some are funny and some are really tragic.
---
Oh cool i can clear up some blue prints i made by accident. I just started so ill keep an eye out for the display.
---
Holy hell! What a tower of joy! Im in love
---
Demolition Expert perk card will also increase damage on gauss rifle as the ammo is explosive.
---
I’m actually seeing a progression from scenario 1 where everyone is on tents and she never lands, but a handful of penta-barrelled gauss miniguns are in the mix and they shred her anyway.
---
NP.  Different workshops yield different plans and mats for capture and defend.  (The plans eventually duplicate, so if you tend to take the same workshops repeatedly, you’ll end up with multiple copies)
---
Bonus: if someone show up during the defend against NPCs (which is considered an Event), they have to (help) kill the invaders before they can take the workshop from you; you still get credit for completing the defend, even if you are sniping from outside the green line :)
---
Sorry but PVP is broken and boring.
---
We need a new end game boss to farm for exclusive items, skins, etc
---
Pretty sure its more that concrete's a bit more scarce than steel or wood, and a lot heavier.
---
Main quest is broken now so maybe they shoud just revert back they just screw it up more trying to fix it.
---
Well im new thanks for the first impression.
---
I'd like some vending machines to buy legendarys from like Borderlands, where randomly rolled guns/armor appear. That way we can control our destiny a bit. I'm sure weapon stations at the BoS is lore-sound.
---
God knows how you stop big dicks cleaning the machines out constantly though.
---
~~I still see 4.65 out of 150 million~~
---
E: I had to launch it through a different browser. Chrome kept showing the same data as before so it might’ve been stored in the cache
---
Kind of?
---
It's supposed to be a big content update, but it's going to be released in staggered updates instead of all at once.
---
I wonder if that would hit the damage resist cap, or just be so asymptotically close as to be irrelevant.
---
Well I said that because ik this, and I agree with you.  Who cares if it's spin off or main series?  I get sick to death of shooting the same weak af super mutants at the same locations til I resort to putting my settlers in uniforms.  ARE WE FUCKIN PLATING HOUSE NOW?!
---
I know it’s a major update, just wondering if they actually said it is similar in size to wastelanders.
---
God, I miss the Grinder from the Pre-Sequel...
---
To be honest the rations thing does sound kind of cool but is pretty useless as well but taht might just be me, I get my food and water filled by just using my usual buffs (noka-cola, alcohol and meats) so those rations would just be there to be diplayed at my camp (not like I'd mind it) but the other things you mentioned sound great especially about BoS specific rewards like the linings for fatigues and to sweeten the deal for late-game they should just give a mixture of not only caps but also some scrip or even small amounts of gold bullion, like have it random where each donation can net you 5-10 scrip or a flat 5 bullion (random which one) though one could argue the bullion makes more sense lore wise as they could also have access to gold where as legendary scrip is not as much of an available resource
---
Yeah. As others have said. One day I got several but most weeks, i get none.
---
How bout we can kill them all if we so choose?  Fuck them
---
Absolutely. All of the games have had them and I love finding them. It makes exploring that much more rewarding.
---
https://fed76.info/pricing/
---
I use this all the time before I scrip something.
---
That just seems way worse than any of them individually, am glad I haven't really seen that too much
---
Are you running a bloodied build?
---
Scrip would be nice too. Was just think how useful soup is like you need both food and water so you just drink up and get both down in one bite.
---
I used 10 modules today and got both arms as well as a leg in unyielding so, it's definitely still there
---
Both of those sound useless. But I'm definitely in the minority on that opinion.
---
Thank you, I didn't bother to donate concrete because I knew 150 mil was not possible. Now I will actually donate the cork I have.
---
You like getting beer and plans you already know??  Is that what it is to be a food build?
---
I pretty much exclusively VATS shotgun with plenty of shotgun and VATS perks.
---
While I’m not someone who checks damage numbers and all that, pretty much every high level normal enemy like ghouls, death claws etc I one shot in VATS with an instigating combat shotgun.
---
Outside of VATS it takes like 5 or 6 shots to kill the same enemy.
---
Outside of VATS it would be nice to see them have a buff.
---
Into my inventory
---
I’m not aware of a list, but one probably exists. Any scrap that has 0 cap value and can be bulked, you can then sell for a specific cap value.
---
All the best toys are for Bloodied right now
---
Another issue nobody seem to be talking about is those damn pop-ups you get after donating. I donated a large amount of steel, and the game was unplayable for about 5 minutes afterwards. Luckily I didn't have that much concrete, so only a few pop-ups. I'm only going to donate a small amount going forward because of these pop-ups.
---
Big dick here, and cleanliness is very important!
---
Thank you!!
---
I’m confused... I went to the link you provided, and it says we’re at just over 12.5/15 million. Did they change it or something?
---
Are you fuckin serious?
---
They should also change the reward to a legendary Participation Trophy.
---
Who’s to say they won’t find a way to make anti Yogi bear armor or super-ultra-mega-triple cushioned limb mods for our armor?
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
LOL thanks, that made me chuckle for sure :)
---
Try a different game to see if its hardware or software related.
---
Check your audio settings to see what you have your output set as.
---
Won't hurt to update the Firmware as well.
---
What if they think ATLAS is a shit hole?
---
I do.
---
It's not like Watoga is a city built entirely of tech... With multiple vertibirds in clearly salvageable condition. 
---
It's not like there's a vault full of America's wealth guarded buy 12 morons playing Men In Black, not just packed with gold but totally NBC grade protection. 
---
Nope. This wack ass weather station so horribly run down is perfect.
---
Ya, i like to think he builds/mods legendary stuff and sends it up. I have glitched behind the fence and he still doesn't do anything, and unfortunately can't pick up anything there.
---
Excuse me? I don't know about you but having a drink to spare or a plan that I can sell for 5 caps so some dude doesn't have to spend 300 on them is nice, plus I also gave a reasonable alternative to that. So maybe before you spit hate that you read the entire article.
---
They really really need to ask the players.everything they have been doing benefits brand new players.the wastelanders with the secret service plans is great.i just finished getting the last part.the helmet.because we cannot see what the scout mask looks lime and mistakenly bought that lame ass mask first.
---
This event was worse if not the same shit as the mole miner dumpster fire.ffs bethesda when will you get your shit together?
---
Yeah I see where you are coming from I usually don't need to deal with food or water as I heal with cola and drink loads of whiskey while having the perks and also eat most meats because of carnivore that's a niche though.
---
As long as those rations aren't heavy I'd gladly take some for convenience though, it´s similar to the pre-war food workshop, just with water to sweeten the deal
---
Yeah you are probably right. I havent really done the maths or researched it too well as far as that goes. Theres a couple of pieces Id like to improve on still. Id rather change out some pieces to troubleshooters at least since robots give me far more problems than other enemies.
---
Does Lifesavers stack btw? Like if I have 2 x pieces of LS I have an increased chance of self reviving?
---
I'd rather see an exchange of plans for BOS scrip than caps.  Use BOS credit to purchase new plans, etc.
---
I've got a display in my living room with a souvenir lighthouse, undamaged trifold flag, fancy framed lighthouse photo and clean vase with flowers. None are particularly rare but I feel like they work as a realistic, in character display. I just wish I had the Thanksgiving display case; here's hoping it comes back to the shop in or before November.
---
It’s more of a strategic location than a tactical one I believe.
---
Like a modern MRE which has like a juice pouch inside of it.
---
This is funny as all heck. Especially when the events listed below still show the original goals lololol
---
I've watched a level 24 Assaultron nearly kill a legendary level 50 scorch beast. The only thing that saved the scorch beast was the mutation that got all its health back.
---
I was watching a level 24 Assaultron in the same spot well on it's way to killing a non-legendary level 50 scorch beast, but I had to log off before the end of the battle.
---
~~I'm grateful that there isn't a legendary level 95 *** Assaultron Queen event.~~
---
Edit: I just remembered the faux sheepsquatch.
---
Full Bush Wookie here and I always opt out of teams when doing daily challenges so I don't ruin anyone's fun.
---
If you're on xbox I'll make you some shit.  Otherwise scrap things to learn mods.  Higher int helps with rates
---
Hopefully they take notice and actually understand WHY
---
Yeah I went to drop the piles of steel I had as per usual and then noticed, oh... Concrete now. Well go bulk and sell all this steel I collected I guess.
---
Then looked at the concrete amount and what I had. At best, I usually have 40 to 60 concrete at any given time. I don't usually go out of my way to collect concrete due to weight limits and how often I use the stuff. There's no way I'll get enough for even one exchange before they switch to something else.
---
So to me, it's both. There isn't enough concrete and the amount they want makes me not even want to bother anymore.
---
How many screws do you use to repair your gear in a week? 20 maybe? Why have more than 100 of any material, junk in fallout is actual trash.
---
Glad I could correct you!  Are you usually wrong?  So when was "A Colosol Problem" suppose to release?  Oh, never mind, fan bois will always make excuses for Big Daddy Todd!  😆
---
Downvoted for funsies &gt;:)
---
10 million I bet.
---
Check new posts, there are literally dozens about the changes made.
---
I just wouldn't.  His dialogue is annoying and his inventory is trash.  Not worth the build budget.
---
The base damage of weapons does scale with level, it depends on the weapon how much it does go up though, not sure what kind of pistol it is to have the same damage stat, would be nice if you could give more info
---
As to the shotguns, they desperately need a damage buff, the vats damage is just bugged, as far as i understood it each pellet does the damage on your item card instead of it being spread between them
---
I believe you stop getting SPECIAL points after level fifty, but then each time you level up you get the chance to rearrange your points into a build that much better suits your character. But regardless, you *will*  reach a point where you have too many perk cards that you like for your points. But you can equip and unequip cards as need be for certain tasks. (Like using Super Duper when crafting, but swapping it with Can Do when scavenging.)
---
Okay sounds good! Thank you. 
---
I'll see if I can google a list for which possum badges are the easiest to do. 
---
They all seem super specific.
---
Such an incredible camp holy hell
---
Bahahahahaha stop buying out (and cleaning) my imaginary weapon machine!!
---
No consequences to being reported. No punishment, means people do whatever they like.
---
Wait so this one isnt daily? you make it sound bugged
---
Its not that we don't WANT to do the concrete, its that concrete is a rarer item than say, steel. Also, they moved the goal from 150 million to 15 million. we are currently sitting at 12.3 million, so we should be able to hit the remaining 2.8 million by tomorrow. yay.
---
Past 50 higher level is just a higher likelihood of having cheesy weapons
---
I'm working on a Gauss shotgun right now. Spending 2 legendary modules on a 1 star weapon sucks. The best 3* I've rolled so far has been a Berserkers that doesnt fit my build at all. The last 2 days I have got Mutant Slayers. Ive been grinding out 200 scrip per day for 2 shots and all I have been getting is garbage.
---
Ahhh alright! 
---
That's awesome and good to know. 
---
Honestly All I really sell in my vendor is Legendary W/A, Plans, and Ammo. 
---
Never thought about selling excess scrap.
---
We know dang well that it their zero key didn’t get stuck. All of this is to try to fish out the dupers.
---
I logged on today for the first time in a week just to help out with the community challenge and found out I only had 175 concrete in total. I have 125 hours of play time and I’m lvl 65, how do I not have a bought to even donate once. I scrap so much
---
Wear a peice of everything but the kind you want. Might just be a placebo but I feel like I've got better odds
---
Now it "miraculously" jumped to 12.53/15 million, just in time to save us all, whee.
---
Only thing with the fast travel mat in a guaranteed spawn would make it too easy to abuse put a trap right in front of it are make it a locked room with a decontamination chamber so bloody builds end up overweight and can't leave meaning they have to drop something that you can just take
---
This is far worse, at least treasure hunting was a thing to do, unfun as it was.
---
I saw a YouTuber build with it, and thought it was part of wastelanders since it's just a rip of the overseers house. After I realized it wasn't, and it wasn't in the atom shop, I looked it up.
---
So true, I'm used to it on the trade sub hoped for more over here :) 
---
I'm honestly concerned about losing items after the favorites wheel "bug" put hearts on pretty much any similar item in my inventory, then randomly choosing which one I equip when I try it. Spent a lot of time grinding and trading and don't want to go thru that again.
---
Apparently it's just me since these guys only experience the fast travel bug. 🤐
---
They'll die to the first Yao Gaui in the Divide.... Plans or no
---
Just like the Scav who keeps getting killed by the two Snallys at the crashes vertibird near/on Hemlock Holes lol She dies horribly over and over its utterly hilarious.
---
You may not be the redditor we need......But you are the redditor we deserve......Take this broke man's version of gold......An almighty upvote
---
Yea it did
---
Still better than the provision box.
---
DON’T WORRY!!
---
If you go to the tracker for the event they changed it to 15 million. Great.
---
But cork is really easy to get by crafting and scrapping level 1 pipe pistols
---
It's doable
---
Doesn't change the fact that they thought 150 million was possible which is evidence they don't play the game
---
Don’t forget all of the gnomes at generals steakhouse
---
I think that's where the dart landed when Beth threw it in the boardroom.
---
About that
---
Booooo. At least the protest worked. Or maybe people just don’t have that much concrete
---
Im gonna suggest drinking all the beer.....Just be careful about those addictions......
---
The problem is bethesda does not listen.we do not want lame events like this.it is mind numbingly stupid.garbage rewards.just stop making these events period.come up with content instead.your creative dept.should be fired.
---
Try restarting the phone.
---
Mine are still there dafuq.
---
Awesome job. I love it. Very creative
---
I always use grafton dam when I need a LV3, the terminal to open the door and the door itself are both LV3.
---
The fixer is a better alternative for dps, it's an improved combat rifle with an effect that improves your stealth significantly, you can get it after going after the sheepsquatch questline  as a rare drop from the event at the end (Encriptid), check out posters at trainstations if you haven't done the questline yet, you also get one free fixer from it, it is only level 30 though no matter what level you have as far as I can remember
---
EDIT: spelling
---
It's resetting daily lol. Poor on caps already.
---
Yep, whatever decides what I'm gonna get vs what I want is no longer getting any help from me 🤣
---
Are the hacked weapons a PC thing or is it a problem on Xbox too?
---
I've played various MMOs my entire life since Everquest and have never had anything even close to this. I'm with ya there I really hope they so take some of that direction and better this experience for all of us.
---
I had forgotten about the knomes! 
---
Also I vaguely remember that one of the power stations have lots of cement bags as well....I forget which though
---
I haven’t seen anything, what post am I suppose to look for?
---
True post apocalypse
---
Npc feelings were a concern to you?  Personally I relished giving Barb a dirt nap.
---
Imo patch 21 make the performance worse. On 22 it would be better
---
The goal's been changed and updated.
---
I typically don’t sell bulk at my vendor either, but instead, sell them TO vendors. Not a bad source of caps
---
Would be nice and would make loads of sense to be honest
---
They reduced the amount from 150m to just 15m. We're already at 12.5 m. All good.
---
Are you turning in mirelurk meat at Ohio river adventures?  That’s helps with raider. And when you do Davenport pictures, sell to one faction for additional reputation
---
As I see it, they'll arrive and be pissed that the place is overloaded in more materials than they ever needed and have zero space for people to live and work because of all the millions of scrap this and that, that are jammed in every corner of Atlas.
---
They had a decent observatory base in a prime location, and now it's a frigging junk yard.
---
It's a shame because the banner is the only truly new reward and really the only one worth anything. As pathetic as it is.
---
If you are a food build you're the last person needing those rewards, as you probably have a huge supply of them already \^\^
---
Better but still 2.5 million concrete
---
*looks at Trump saying Yo-Semites twice*
---
I'd imagine it goes a little like this....."Can you believe those idiots actually pay us for a problem that we caused?".......Bwahahaha......."Man talk about Simps for fallout amiright???"
---
You just need to nuke the right places .)
---
Sounds like you missed the part where SH-PA got a huge nerf due to server lag
---
I still get a kick out of how many toy tea parties ive found so far
---
Marsupial, marsupial, marsupial.  Carnivore/herbivore
---
Just saw it a couple minutes ago. lolz
---
just changed it to 15 million
---
How do you enable the pacifist mode anyway?
---
Its considered a daily, but if you hop servers, you can do it multiple times a day.
---
Some will try to argue otherwise but at least they haven't cheated the numbers in any way or tried to hide them, it still clearly shows how badly the player community failed if they have to reduce it to 10%. Noone has won but I'm sure some people will see it as a victory over the Bethesda.
---
Now how about all those moaners put their money where their mouth is and gather the last 2M? Personally I'd like it to still fail and I will be vendor ing any remaining supplies after the timer has moved on.
---
And then we're supposed to EARN a double score xp event.
---
BETH’s been terribad with fixing the game and people are tired of it and don’t care plus there’s little to no consequence
---
hurr durr bethesda wont fake the numbers, we can actually fail, they say as bethesda nerfs the challenge by **135 MILLION** concrete.
---
Meanwhile I'm helping new players with deathless then giving them nuka shine
---
I do this for sport, it's a way of life.
---
They just changed it to 15 million.
---
Only if ya suck,
---
Right!! And they drop only their meat. Fuck your meat.
---
Yeah it's a known issue. Who knows if it will ever be fixed.
---
I keep seeing people say they don't play their own game, but I don't think that's true. I think they play, and simply don't comprehend what we would collectively want from a Fallout experience. And that shouldn't be surprising to anyone - the game launched with almost no NPC interaction, and no meaningful choices. In a FALLOUT game. I'm personally okay with the way the story was told, but it was decidedly not akin to a typical Fallout experience.
---
Considering the basis of the games' original concept went against what people expected out of Fallout, seeing events not hit the mark isn't surprising. What IS surprising is that, according to the project lead on the game (his name currently escapes me), EVERY member of the team plays both on and off work hours. So how is it, two years in, that the devs are still, seemingly, failing to understand what can make the game fun or engaging? They come up with fantastic ideas that get executed poorly.
---
I don't even know how they can change their process going forward, but I strongly believe that SOMETHING needs to change.
---
It happens sometimes with my Black Powder Pistol. Usually trying again with it equipped (or unequipped) instead makes it visible.
---
Sorry, are you saying it stopped working after hopping servers?
---
The acid damage from your attacks still applies, it's just fairly slow so you may not spot it.  
---
The problem is the radial damage either bugged or nerfed so badly as to basically be bugged.  
---
Best I can suggest is fire off a ticket, but yeah, right now that part really isn't working properly and hasn't since Wastelanders.
---
Lead Pipes yield Concrete when scrapped, I have a bunch of concrete but I will not be donating any because it's MINE! The BOS can live in Shit Wood Shacks like the rest of us.
---
Not really you have about 5sec to use a stimpack with one 25 poison armor ,
---
No I read it I just don't get your mindset.  I care what a complete stranger has to pay for something I found my damn self?
---
I see it most often on Sunday mornings on Xbox.
---
;)
---
My first chest peice.chameleon,breathe underwater,&amp;33% vats accuracy.i have been extremely lucky with the ss builds.all except for 1 of mine i did great.left leg was done a couple times to get what i wanted.a poisoner.with 30%reduced from bugs and mirelurks.
---
Shotguns are the worst offenders for most of the damage/enemy health regeneration bugs in the game. Explosive only seems to compound these issues. VATS seems to help sometimes, but not always. I have dozens of great shotguns stashed away until the day Bethesda finally patches them. Then I’ll take them out for a day or two, realize how quickly the high damage ones break and so back to heavies.
---
100k+ players. That's adorable :)
---
I’ve been having similar experiences. Entering WestTek and there are naked bald Super Mutants standing around, fixated doing nothing and can’t be killed. 
---
Other times I enter an area and I instantly hear enemies dying without there being any action going on. Kind of like the robots at Whitespring Resort. You enter it, you hear robots breaking down, you walk around and see broken robots lying around.
---
So why would anyone want them?!  It's circular logic, bro!
---
I hope it’s gonna be really fast on ps5
---
This was intentional, not a bug. It is on a long list of items that are excluded from the perk card's effects.
---
Yeah might just ditch him. Budgets always a concern
---
Say no to ghoul farming
---
Yeah, my initial assumption was that all aspect of pacifist mode would automatically turn off for everyone who enters the workshop area, but I read some conflicting answers online saying it would turn on the incoming damage you receive ONLY, and you won’t be able to hit them back until you manually turn off pacifist in your settings. I couldn’t test it out as none of my friends play the game. :’(
---
From the answers I’m getting here, it doesn’t sound like I have to keep switching back and forth. Thanks for your input!
---
Sometimes stims just won't heal you or work right away.  You're super vulnerable regardless.
---
I'm going there right now! Thanks!
---
Thanks! I'll give it a try.
---
Audio works fine on other games  
---
Output is set to my headset and is the default device  
---
Up to date
---
It's down to 15 million (from 150 million) and we're at 12.5 million. It'll be completed.
---
I mean the rewards are pretty bad so why not donate resources 🤔
---
Are you *really* complaining about Bethesda doing what was asked of them and making the goal more realistically accessible to the playerbase?
---
Agreed. No scum to me. Just playing the game with a fun strat
---
My guess is they were dead all along from another player, but just hadn't registered as dead on your screen yet. I've had this happen a lot of times.
---
There's another source of concrete, and....it's gnomes. 
---
So, go collect gnomes, you bunch of gnomes while you're wearing your little gnome hat.
---
Bethesda apparently didn't
---
Scroll down ;)
---
This is the way.
---
There already is bos combat armor.which i used before the ss came.did they say there is one coming?if not then i doubt it will be there since it already exists.
---
And they didn't fake the numbers did they? Instead they had to reduce the end point which shows how useless the community was that it didn't even reach 10%.
---
Weird. Have you looked at in game settings.
---
Yeah. Switched back to paper bags until it gets fixed.
---
Bird Bones Serum+ Goat Legs Perk card + Chinese Stealth Suit and you take minimal damage. Can jump from the roof of Watoga and only take a sliver of damage.
---
I donated half my steel (10k) half my concrete (500) and if I donate half my cork I wouldn't have enough to get a reward.
---
Other than for performance issues that is what every update is for all video games...
---
The pvp community asks for very little and gets none of it.  So yes I am.  This is lame AF
---
It made sense for sure for a Fallout game like this, the amount of money made thru micro-transactions is an ever expanding reality in all games. I understand the frustration of those who love this game. I love it as well. 
---
Really never experienced this in a game before so my intent was to get some feedback from those who may have.
---
Thank you. That gave me a lot of insight into the process.
---
You're annoying to look at..
---
Don’t sell bulk. Sell Purified Water and weapons.
---
It should be Ward. A 3 stage boss battle where he just evolves into a tougher form. Raider Ward, shadow Ward and Ward behemoth where he throws osmosis kits at you.
---
Well i know what i am doing the next few days lol
---
Salty crew
---
After this, I think we don’t even need to try for the rest of the event. I mean, it’s not as if they can just NOT give us the update. 
---
Just imagine, they set up this huge, dumbass event JUST so people have SOMETHING to do while waiting for the next lackluster update, and then we just don’t complete it. They’d be at a loss! Either they could just not give us the update, then get backlash from the community for setting unrealistic goals, or they could give us the update, and we wouldn’t have to do the event! It’s a win-win for 76 players no matter the outcome!
---
You have to open it at the zipper. Works just fine.
---
What else is on this "long list"?  I can't think of any, and Googling it doesn't produce any documented exceptions
---
I'm not saying anyone wants them, I am just saying that your statement about the food builds doesn't really make sense
---
Wouldn’t it be great of players actually learned the game?
---
It's a random encounter spoofing 2 chat bots in a loop with each other. They turn up quite often at Cranberry Glade when I'm looking for pets to tame.
---
Why? She spawns, she dies. Everyone gets time to get her hits in (by “shred” I don’t mean insta-kill).
---
Lol yeah I’ve found a couple, too. Those seem to be a staple of the Fallout games.
---
Awesome, I’m going to look up which plans I get from each location! My character focus is stealth and long-range combat, so that sounds like a perfect plan haha. Thanks again!
---
Yes, it’s been a random encounter possibility since launch. I’ve been killing them both for over a year :)
---
Yes, multiplicativly though. So first one is 50%, second is 75%, third is 87.5%... more than 3 is generally not worth it. And the fact that it only works when DOWNED is a limiting factor... but I still love it.
---
Oh okay great, I’m happy they listened and took a look at it.
---
Vlad &amp; Mia, they're based on a pair of [real-world Google AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4X6p7H8EJs) who talk to each other, their dialogue is representative of what the Google AI conversations are like.
---
Apparently it's based on a 'real life' Siri/Cortana exchange where the two AIs jabbered on endlessly without a human to break the loop.
---
Try a repair kit.
---
Somerset Special vs a Suppressor's Single Action Revolver. Both .44. 
---
I had gotten mine at like level 20 something and just never replaced it. I unfortunately scrapped it so I can't give the exact values -_-, 
---
Checking between the stats I was confused why their damage was the same. I'll fully admit I may have been mistaken but I think my Somerset special was modded somewhere like 65 damage, while the level 50 pistol is only a mild upgrade at 71 damage with the same fire rate.
---
That's not true. I went to Poseidon Energy and there were 6 whole bags of it there. We only need to wait for it to respawn 25,000,000 times and we are set.
---
As expected, they lowered the bar.
---
I can assure you that I will struggle to hit that damage cap for loot if she stays in the air as a melee build but I do get what you mean there is a reason I've been investing in ranged weapons recently
---
Cranberry relish. 20% xp boost with Herbivore mutation. Needs cranberries, sugar, gourds.
---
They should made it so you could donate any of the items during the event. Have it on a point system with harder to get items giving more points.
---
My knowledge of BOS back story comes almost exclusively from FO3 so i could be wrong but didn't the BOS collect tech?
---
So lorewise, wouldn't it make more sense to have made the event give rewards in exchange for guns (probably laser guns) and power armor as opposed to raw material? Or alternatively have laser guns or power armor as a reward for turning in raw material?
---
It probably sounds stupid because most people,especially end game players, don't really want laser weapons (even if legendary) or need power armor pieces, but at least it'd make sense.
---
Treasure hunters brought us the endless joy of full body gorilla taxidermy And Harabe means  how dare you even suggest it was worse. This one brings you nothing for your individual participation. There’s nothing of lasting importance to anyone except the public rewards which you can’t really affect as a individual. Treasure hunter premise and rewards were great the drop rate was just too low for high end Pails and then the low drop rate of good plans. The bookbag is still the most valuable item in the game
---
It's because they set the target too high, and the community failed to even get to 10% of that. No one should be celebrating this crap feat but I suspect many will see it as a victory by default.
---
For those who never changed it before, you do it in the atom shop, similar to how you change player icons.
---
I have a lot of caps.
---
Wish you could share blueprints
---
Just use luck of the draw at rank 3
---
Yeah we all know damn well were not even close to the new 15mil goal. I mean come on, we were at 4mil and now were at 12 mil all of a sudden. Am I the only that thinks its lame that they have to baby us and push us to the goal?
---
Yhea, I have been doing those.
---
I know, I mean it wouldn't be hard to implement, but once it is, they aren't getting it back.  If for some reason they had a sudden reduction in players they could implement it as a quick fix
---
Who hurt you?
---
note i never said this one way or another, but fudging would be something on the back end, this is outright lowering the goal
---
I can tell you why that is, the summerset special comes with a hardened receiver which adds +10 dmg, while the damage difference between a level 20 and 50 .44 revolver is also 10, so any damage difference you saw was due to any mod on the higher level version or the legendary effect
---
But we reached the steel goal in record time. Not our fault they gave us a stupidly massive goal for which we need to collect some of the most rare and hard to farm material in the game.
---
Yes, you can often see them as random encounter at Cranberry Glade, i think It's Vlad and Mia. there's a story behind them that I didn't bother to learn, but it's funny to hear them talk.
---
They reduced the amount needed to 15 million and there are 12 million donated.
---
It’s only 15 million now. Which is crazy. But I also hope that they change the cork too cause for sure isn’t going to happen either!
---
I’d say yes if it was just a standard pipe, but since it’s bolt action you can’t fire fast enough to get noticeable benefits from the first and last perks
---
Would be better if these guys just only used it in a Private Server. Too bad they only have money for the hacked weapon and not Fallout 1st.
---

---
Wait till you get to 2 toons with 400 +
---
6 of one
---
Yeah, how dare Bethesda adjust the requirements at the behest of the players and make it more accessible to them? 🙄 We hate when developers listen to players, just like we tell them to!!!
---
Scrip. The suppressor effect is pretty poor on a sniper weapon in single player.
---
Ok? But replying to multiple people being a narcissistic ass isnt helping anyone, especially when your comment wasnt a reply but a random comment in the feed, so everyone you replied to still has no reason why youre being a douche to them.
---
Yeah we "accidentally" said 150 million,the real number was 150 thousand and you guys smashed it!
---
Apparently there is some form of mod support on the horizon, which means it will *finally* be possible for some hobbyists to easily clean up the mess of these useless "professionals" in next to no time..
---
Are you also going to give a shit about 50% pruveyor sale and double score weekend? Or you going to be happy to utilize them as the bigger reward of thecommunity challenge?
---
I have another 5 hours until I'm out of work. Then I have to see how much concrete is on my alt. The beret is the one reward I DONT want lol.
---
repair kits work, and i don’t think it has any mods you can equip
---
Mine is in the same situation, i just ignore It.
---
Unyielding Meta be like
---
...Or if you are not interested in one note combat system where you just stack damage and the same effects so players only do 0 or 1 damage against you(evasive perk) when you are healing at 100's of health per tick and become and invincible god.
---
It’s an odd mix. To me it’s like the lite version of every genre a fallout game could fit into. RPG, MMO, Survival, FPS, heck evening battle royale-lite. It makes a game that is very easily adaptable to any player, especially ones with friends who have different tastes, but not a lot of people are going to be wholly sold on it because there isn’t one playerbase this was made for. 
---
The best thing they can do now is what they’re best at- world building. I think if they followed their instincts more on we’d see a cooler project. Whenever they made a design choice that failed, it seems like they allowed the reddit community to talk them into more fan service. No npc’s became settlers vs raiders and now BoS which will most likely lead to enclave,  quit raids failed and now we’ll see expeditions to previously explored locations. 
---
These aren’t bad things, but I think they’re allowing the reddit community to dictate their actions too much and it’s consistently leading to just more complaints. Which is probably why some people were so opposed to your going alone post. It’s not that your concerns aren’t warranted, but reddit has been kinda a breeding ground for f76 hate. The only community more toxic than this one has been YouTube. And you should never want to be like the YouTube community...
---
They simply gave up. ‘I can’t play if i don’t cheat’.
---
the hit box is the same as the paper bag, you have to open it from one of the side faces
---
Only pc - hacked weapons popped up as a result of a bug in the code for purveyor. It made it so you were able to manipulate the effects, weapons, as well as attachments to those weapons. Not possible on Xbox due to the OS
---
Legendary run
---
I have FO1st and easily donated 20k steel. I went to donate concrete last night and I had 150 I’m my stash. I checked cork and it’s a little more but not much. What the fuck is cork used for that I have none and 1st has been out for how long? If I had over a thousand I’d be a little ok with it but it was in the hundreds that’s it.
---
It's been my experience that any time you can make the progression linear and guaranteed, you essentially kill off the loop for people playing the game and they all go to find something else to do.
---
As much as you want what you're chasing, you don't want the chase to ever not be a chase, otherwise you stagnate, lose interest, and leave.
---
You don't see the value of a private server?
---
This would be way more awesome than just putting a flat rate of one cap For each plan regardless of the plan in my vendors. Maybe not for the Rando‘s that buy them from me but for me for sure!
---
Not sure what adorable about the daily player count but anyway you can troll somewhere else. I’m done engaging.
---
  "I'll never give you a dime for such criminality"
---
lmao
---
Think you missed the point that you can stimpaks when hiding after taking any part of the blast. You do that before popping back out to get the assaults on to discharge the beam. I know your are being sarcastic and I pivoted your post, because it was kind of "smirk" funny, but this is really a helpful, bullet point on how to beat an assaultron on every time. Good luck if there is no cover.
---
Its not worth emptying out my stash for a bunch of garbage rewards.
---
If i got something good I might care
---
Yeah, it sucks that they captivate people with basic features that would go a long way to improving the game.  It's bad enough playing private sessions is behind such a thing.
---
The next worst thing they could do is make people pay for mods like they've tried to do in the past.
---
Ehhh.  Slightly.    I got pissed the other day cause the lag was nearly unbareable so i went through my inventory and tossed every single holotape and note the game would allow me with a few exceptions like the silo holo tape
---
I remember how important that was for previous fallout games, I hope so, I look forward to it for sure!
---
No. Pure solo player here.
---
Theres a vendor there? Fuck me walking down assaultron alley
---
That's what they did with the vault they closed down after it was opened. They just have to tie the 4 or 5 star gear with a limited time event
---
Ok I'll try to make more sense.  If you do quests at all, you're given more water and rad away than ten characters could carry.  So needing those beers for something to drink is absolute bull shit.  If you're doing quests at all, the majority of the plans are either awarded to you or gained from scrapping the weapons and armor you get instead, so needing more of them for any reason is absolute bullshit.  I guess what I mean here, is that the only thing that really sells in a player vendor is unwanted legendaries.  Am I wrong?  Of course I'm not.  People just buy cheap bs for the score, man.  My friend and I accomplish this by buying 3 pocket lint for 1 cap a piece.  So you're basically just collecting those useless plans to be like "I am the king of all foodies"
---
Bullion plan weapons and armor are not affected by super duper.
---
It’s only unlimited junk stash, but the tent is really useful in terms of a free fast travel point.
---
Why would people donate with the shit rewards we are getting ? What’s the point if half the people in game straight up hate the BOS anyway
---
I have the same bug right now.
---
Its just enough to notice but not enough to write home about imho
---
Farm scorched for lead pipes 🙍
---
p sure I have a fan club..
---
Cork needs to be less than 10 million at this point.
---
I got the steel beret reward today but I donated steel.
---
Will we get the concrete reward if we didn't donate or do I need to donate at least one time
---
We've all noticed
---
I’m going to be doing final destination lots in anticipation.
---
I don't mean to sound like a negative nancy btw. Just trying not to get my own hopes up lol
---
Um.....
---
It still does for me, too. I had to switch from Chrome to Edge to see the updated numbers.
---
Laughs in gatling gun and 50 cal. 
---
Honestly, not something laugh at the pain of others. I seriously feel for you on this.
---
FINE.  I logged in and contributed 250 concrete.  I hope you're happy.
---
Did they say secret service armor was coming?  If say thats faulty logic.  There's a bos mod for combat armor, not straight up bos armor.
---
Exactly
---
What’s the benefit of playing in a private server beside being able to run workshops without disturbance? Because this is really the only thing I can think about that would benefit me while playing in a private server
---
Somehow, I've managed to level 93 without it. But sure, it would be nice.
---
Hopefully, but I was thinking if concrete went from 150M to 15M then cork would go from 200M to 20M maybe?
---
Whew. That’s a good joke right there.
---
Well there was a fail here, you're right
---
Cork is a lost cause, plastic will take some work if its possible, but leather and cloth should be comparatively easy though not on the same level as steel. Leather is just farming hides and off the top of my head a single Collision Course is 100 pre war money per participant.
---
Ha, this made me laugh.
---
At least they have maybe seen sense? The concrete and cork goals were unachievable.
---
Yeah i just finished my set along with calibrated shocks and emergency protocols
---
Huh
---
Is it a bug or a corruption? Is what I’m wondering
---
Play.
---
How many characters do you have?
---
And will it affect my game or not
---
This is supposed to be the end-game repeatable questline and the more I hear about it, the more I'm hesitant to ever do it with other random people.  I wish I could play by myself or with friends in an instanced event version of this.
---
sadly :(
---
The devs are roleplaying as vault tec , only thing that makes sense at this point after all this failure
---
ty
---
Same here. I donated about 2000. It's not too hard to farm if you know where to go and have access to a private server. Now cork on the other hand, I use that for making armor ultra light and only have like 1k after months of general farming. I may deposit 250 but that's gonna be it.
---
I appreciate the answer. If two weapons have the same damage, will a higher level version still be more effetive against higher level enemies or does that not matter?
---
Was it a BE LMG level 30? Sold at a camp near V76.
---
Unlimited scrap storage. Not unlimited stash.
---
I mean I’m 240 and don’t have FO1st, it’s not a necessary to play the game. It’s pretty much just QoL with some extra perks. That’s how they are able to get away with it.
---
I don't get why you are getting so worked up, I never said anyone needed the rewards that are in the game neither did I say that the plans could be sold, I simply agreed with you but added that food based builds wouldn't need them either as you said "Is that what it is to be a food build" because it definitely is not
---
I paid 3k caps for a weapon from someone's vendor and it never appeared in my inventory never flashed the screed saying I jist got the gun idk what happened dont have it i checked my bank my persons like 10 times and nothing
---
logged in this evening and the "news" banner on the login page (PS4) had atlas looking for concrete.  It listed the needed amount was 15M not 150M.   The website still shows 150M   Hmmmm,  wonder which is correct.
---
For the love of god don't give them ideas as mods are gonna be possible.
---
Yeah there arnt many options in game. its really just sliders that adjust music and in game volume which I set them to max. I don't really know what to do
---
eh, they know how much concrete we all have. I have first and often sit on the junk yard extracting concrete among other stuff. I have a couple of thousand on just my main.
---
They knew how much we have, they overestimated how much we’re willing to give it away for the rewards they offer
---
Wastelanders..
---
For 3’000’000 caps, if it wasn’t for their first born super mutant baby, you got cheated anyway.
---
seems like u got scammed
---
Isn’t that a quest item?
---
I know what is gonna doom him. Talking to him, he said all the robots were there were hostile but a former robco employee taught him how to make them unhostile.
---
The BOS will consider that abusing technology and he should of just destroyed them. Therefore, prison sentence or death.
---
I understand the idea in the story about needing the concrete but yeah, that number was entirely unrealistic.
---
Like the others have said it does help but if you are like me and collect outfits as well the apparel tab will still lag. Does seem to help though.
---
This.
---
Your post said 3000k (3 million)
---
I’m a mobile platform , I do this
---
Yet it works with crafting serums....
---
I had this level 3 trying to kill me and my ally with a hook, he was being really annoying so I locked him inside my house, or he picked the locks or he fast travel, it was the last option so thankfully he left 😅
---
Ok, but they are "unique" in many respects, ie, can't trade, can't vend, can't drop.  Brewed items don't match them in that respect.
---
3 millions??? u must be somewhere wrong.. maybe 3k caps?
---
I think the rewards play a big part. I mean personally I'd kinda prefer no reward, if I was just donating for maybe a few caps but no crates I would feel like I'm donating for the sake of the community rewards. But getting a bunch of crap I have to then spend a few minutes trying to remove from my inventory just seems like donating materials to go back to playing inventory management simulator again. I DON'T WANT ALCOHOL OR CRAP WEIGHING ME DOWN
---
Try to get a better internet connection. I find if it’s poor the game runs horribly
---
I do pretty much every event this game throws at me including logging in daily to do the dailies for the legendary run that I borderline don't care about anymore.  But I have zero interest in this grindfest.  seriously why would people participate in this the reward is negligible at best and the amount of time wasted and resources used is ridiculous.
---
Beckett quest reward
---
I got killed one time before I could deploy my camp the third time. Not thrilled about that one.
---
Yea that’s a good one. It’s funny, after 900 hours I still find random encounters I’ve never seen before. Yesterday it was an eyebot doing Morse code. Nothing really came of it though.
---
Does the acid damage register the damage numbers to pop up? I tried shooting some super mutants once and watching, but if I unequipped the helmet, i was hitting for the same numbers
---
All I can suggest now is uninstall the audio drivers completely. Then re-install. Also look at graphics drivers. Nvidia have HD audio function with their drivers.
---
Go to another persons camp and check their collectron terminal. Usually a lv 3 passcode
---
It doesn't matter as far as I am aware but keep in mind that the higher level revolver will out-damage the other one if it is upgraded, take this with caution though as the anti armor effect may very well out-weight this, especially for higher level enemys, ironically. Might still be worth it as their damage output is reduced with your other one so it depends on what you prefer.
---
The CORK wants 200 million, even more than the concrete LOL
---
If you think that's evasive sir, well you need help. study some more mechanics on how the tankiness works and come back to me. It's not evasive, also even without that shenanigans you can kill em. I just suck dude, all these excuses for bad aim and build, one good gun is all it takes.
---
Legit no.
---
It's okay cosmetic chaser I don't need your shit.
---
Ah, you know what. I just finished his quest and did his first fetch quest. That's what it was. Thank you.
---
Yea it’s super annoying, especially when trying to gift to new players.
---
Wouldn't it be great if Perk card descriptions were accurate?  
---
Super Duper:  "When you craft anything"
---
Did you keep all the gold for yourself?
---
yea, i was on a break from the game until Wastelanders, but I figured any damage bonus would be helpful. that said, i can't see that its doing any damage at all, which would be a bit more than just a nerf
---
No it was a crappy weapon I made a mistake buying it but made even worse by not getting the weapon at least maybe I could have re sold it. It was a bloodied Fatman with plus 15% reload speed and plus 33% vats hit chance i didnt mean to buy it but i still wanted it if i paid for it i am building a vats build and im fairly new and I thought maybe just in case i would buy it but yea i know shitty gun but still I didn't even know that could happen
---
The best of us have figured out how to build a fighting platform to stand on while we wreck the Queen after she lands and wipe out the adds on the ground. Getting her to land on it is tedious and completely unpredictable
---
I was prepared to do the same thing, they need to get their shit together.  This is pretty embarrassing.  I played all day Sunday with small breaks at my CAMP to do a chore here and there. If I had known that the goal was more attainable, I would have at least farmed the Abandoned Bog all day while farming flux or getting some of those side quests done that don't have bugs that prevent me from finishing them.
---
Completing the tadpole badges unlocks the 60lb standard back pack and the ability to earn possum badges. Possum badges can be turned in for backpack mods like armor plated,high capacity and more.
---
Don't play over wifi if you want to cheat the system.
---
Because they ignore the hell out of pvp and y'all just praise em for every new scavenger hunt no one wants.  The game was made with pvp in mind so for our money, I believe we have the right not to be repeatedly stepped on and shoved aside like this.  I and many others have chosen to boycott the #brotherswhosteal so I'm a little dissatisfied with this result to say the least.  When do we get to have something.  Inb4 NW because it's trash, and definitely not what we asked for.  It's basically just a bad kid server when we havent actually done anything wrong.
---
Big surprise, they won’t let these events fail. Even if only 12 concrete were donated, it would somehow succeed.....
---
I am also hesitant on starting the event myself as it can go wrong for yourself easily despite all the effort you need to put in
---
Its a bit of a 50/50 discussion imo. It has elements of farming though isn't farming in it's true nature
---
You already have VATS unknown?
---
While I think it’s overhyped, it definitely does its job well. My damage to ammo spent has been great since switching. When you consider that I can run it as my primary and I still collect more ammo than I spend by just playing the game, it’s by far the most versatile gun I’ve used.
---
Back to hype, there’s just way too large a deep worry between god tier and A lvl weapons. Without any system in place to normalize prices, a weapon that can deal an extra 2% can be worth 100’s more flux
---
Jokes aside.
---
Guaranteed exp farming route. 
---
Farming of junk and other droppables in world that take a while to respawn. 
---
Slightly less lag. 
---
Workshops. 
---
I don't have fallout 1st. If i cared about any of that stuff I would get it simply so my friends and I could farm. However since most of it is possible in public with the occasional items missing I won't ever buy it. 
---
Don't forget it also comes with atoms and free additional items as well.
---
Unlimited scrap storage, survival tents, private servers, and an amount of atoms that exceeds what you would get if you bought them. It's not for everyone but for folks who spent at least the amount on atoms it's basically free and extremely useful
---
Perks. Also well worth it just for the private server.
---
Not for everyone, but well worth it to me. Value is relative so YMMV.
---
The thing is, I like the game enough and certainly play it enough, that I WOULD pay for it, if it somehow made the game better in some compelling way. Extra junk storage just makes me angry because you spend all this time collecting junk, only to run out of space and have to bulk it all up, waste your plastic, and then sell it for caps I'll never be able to spend. lol
---
Regarding #4, the gauss rifle is good but don’t use it in close range or vats - bugs out a lot and frequently does no damage
---
Grind
---
Agreed. I would imagine a 3 page quick wheel would be possible. Pressing the quick wheel button would open the favorites wheel as normal, but you could "flip" to a different page. First page would be "weapons", left page could be "apparel" and right page could be "aid". On console, I would open the wheel as normal, and flip to a new page while the wheel is open using one of the bumper buttons. Pages could come predetermined or customizable.
---
This game needs some serious UI upgrades for sure. Pip is slow and clunky, favorites wheel doesn't always work right, trade interface is garbage, perk menu is ANNOYING if you have even a single point banked even worse if you have a perk pack stored, vending is still terrible to load weapons/apparel.
---
I do like your idea of short aid macros. One of the most interesting parts about FF14 was creating your own macros for combat. I really do think Beth could learn a lot by taking a step back and looking at what makes MMO games successful and fun.
---
I experience vats bug in pve. It’s a core mechanic and it’s being worked on, and easy to work around. They’re just slow. I fight people if they want to in workshops.. Team mechanics were changed because of intentional griefing, not sure what they can do about that. I should have asked you how they could fix pvp, without adding the griefing lol.
---
You are making this to be about something it is not about so I'll just leave you to it.
---
My wife and I used 4 work shops that had concrete, we played for a good 3 to 4 hours, we got about a thousand each. If everyone one left the extractors unlocked, and pitched in every so often, I think we could do it.
---
What? You realize this is a community event that has community rewards and besides no one forcing you to do so.
---
Can't wait for my horse armor from Oblivion... Lol
---
Eh suppressor sucks unfortunately. However, I use a non-legendary pipe bolt action and can get close to 1000 damage. So if it’s your first one, it may be worth playing around with. 
---
[this is my build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=cd344f5&amp;d=ad2al2ak2an2ao0a31p00pd2pk2pp2pl2c70cr0cu0i12ik0s52sb1si2se0sj2eo2l71lt2&amp;m=cf0)
---
This.  Plus there is a cosmetic you can apply to the backpack to make it 'tadpole' or 'possum' or neither, but it has no functional difference.
---
If it wasn't already mentioned, ricochet works in PA and comes with a startling loud proc effect.
---
Yep. That’s why I used it for 3 mins
---
Negative, just looked that up and I want it now.
---
I love the lunchboxes.  Wish we could earn them in game after the run is finished.
---
You gotta keep up to date. Booze ain’t the only thing it doesn’t work with.
---
They told us.
---
if you mean the aesthetic mods, they are just slightly different colors and have their respective patches.
---
Scrip
---
The only part of the unlimited stash I'd like (also a lvl 240+) is the ability to negotiate trades with huge junk numbers. Some people deal out like 25k lead or steel or something in place of caps but without the storage theres no way I could get involved in that. I have 8k atoms and never spent a dime to earn them or spent atoms in the shop so I could care less for that perk or the cosmetics in general
---
She's a stroppy cow anyway, bollocks to her...
---
Really? I could have sworn I’ve duped things there before.
---
Oh
---
Are you done trying to start arguments and rants over something that’s been around for months and really isn’t that big of a deal?
---
1. u must hit at the same point 
---
2. it depends how the server registers ur actual fire rate. Should work with firerate 200+ or 100+ if it is explosive. TS as well can trigger the effect
---
Any way watch AT videos in utube who explained it pretty clear.
---
&gt; Completing the tadpole badges unlocks the 60lb standard back pack
---
You only need to complete 3 of them to finish the quest and get the backpack, not all of them.
---
Some dumbass downvoted this but I have the 60 pound backpack and have not completed all of the tadpole challenges. It's accurate info.
---
Whatever you feel like doing
---
Uncontested legendary enemies I'm pretty sure the fps improves etc
---
Based on what source? I get the feeling you're pulling those stats out of your arse.
---
Happy to be proven wrong but I think I'm pretty safe here.
---
I got my wife into it as well. Very similar fun was had when she was starting. I’ve been playing a few months longer than her but I’m only 62 and she’s already almost 50! Took her a minute to figure out running and aiming and the like, but now she’s a damned pro and we just bop about on private servers, doing whatever dumb fun thing strikes our fancy. Couples who slay together, stay together.
---
I have really good Secret Service armor for the build I put together. Unfortunately, that means I can't really justify using the Chinese Stealth Armor unless I'm in a nuke zone. Even then, the tradeoff is huge, and the only thing that makes it worth it is how little radiation I absorb while sprinting through the nuke zone to collect nuked flora. And Goat Legs is a 9 pt Agility card, correct? If so, I also can't afford to reallocate my SPECIAL points without breaking my build. Good tips for my alts, none of whom have anything particular going on. Thanks for the tips!
---
There’s a great one on the road near the mansions , somebody bike jumped a huge gap and died lol
---
Well if your camp is in low level area it can drop at level 20 instead of 50, they said they patched it, but didnt do a good job, it still happens...
---
Just saw that and was wondering if they realized it was a mistake or a visual glitch.  Let's do it.
---
The.  WHAT.
---
I've been using the analog stick like a FOOL for all this time!!!
---
I feel like it was just a number one of the managers came up with (that clearly doesnt play the game)
---
Sorry i ment 3k..
---
It's not even me giving them ideas, that's been the writing on the walls since them and Valve had that brief little joint venture with paid mods about half a decade ago.
---
Ever since then, while Valve has backed down, Bethesda has clearly been trying to tread the ground of capitalizing on mods again.  Their own Creation Club is skirting the line very narrowly, and it seems clear to me they have their eyes on seeking some gain from mods in their future titles.  I'm sure they're planning something, and I'm hoping whenever it does happen, they're immediately condemned by the community at large until they have no choice but to back down.
---
I find that bloatfly farming is best done as a team sport.  Also, they don't always spawn where the kill takes place for me. Last time we did this, we got very short spawn chains for 8-10 starting creatures, and then found that many bloatflies around the corner.  
---
Also, why can't I find a legendary syringer? I just want it out of my scrappable items list...
---
Stupid question but does donating on console contribute to the pc or is it seperated
---
Not really. Because the way they choose to apply discounts to their products only shows they don't try to change their standing.
---
Repair kits work. This weapon can't be modified.
---
All the items get released as a freebie on the Atomic Shop after the goal is met regardless of whether you participated or not, you just have a limited time to claim it (like a week or so I think)
---
Actual content is free. So I don’t know what you are going on about lol
---
Yeah the multi-page idea is good but I wasn't sure how it would work out for consoles as I play on pc myself, I like your suggestions
---
And well they should generally take a step back and look at quality of life features but there's not much we can do to make them do it.
---
Don't forget about the people who label their vendors. That's really appreciated.
---
Kind of normal in a Betheada game really.
---
In every relationship, the magic just seems to disappear.  Sometimes slowly, sometimes all at once, but sadly it's time to move on.
---
pkunachan, feel free to add me. Also just signed up for fallout 1st against my better judgment so happy to share the private server with anyone interested.
---
Cool, my camp is at alpha site alpha. Finger's crossed. Thank you for the info.
---
I sided with the raiders twice. Once giving them the gold the other I kept it all. She gets salty and sweet with both my toons and various times.
---
Since April when it was released on Steam.
---
The pricing in this game is targeted to whales because there actually people out there that will do 20 bucks on a skin
---
I mean lets be real somebody probably HAS told them that, its likely middle management refusing to listen to the people actually making the contant
---
I knew they were going to cook the books somehow
---
Damned bullet sponges....
---
Me too.
---
How deceived do you have to be to consider the content they added "free", instead of "something that should've been part of the game to begin with"?
---
Great thanks, good insight.
---
I’m expecting the spin doctoring to be heavy with this. 
---
First people said all these challenges would autocomplete no matter what because Bethesda was fudging the numbers behind the scene. But that clearly was disproven. 
---
And now that Bethesda is saying, ‘You know what, guys &amp; gals?  We made a bad estimate of the situation, so we’re going to take the feedback and make improvements.’  But that’s going to be spun as incompetence instead of improvement.  There were even people ready to do that yesterday, chomping at the bit to make another attack. 
---
Let the haters stew in their own bile. Bethesda makes plenty of mistakes. But refusing to give them any credit when they make an improvement?  That’s just irresponsible.
---
When they screw up, why do we tell them?  Just to vent and whine, or to actually encourage them to make improvements?
---
Blocker ,Serindipity, for perks 
---
Grounded and scaly skin for mutations
---
Bolstering and Vampires armor and weapons 
---
Pretty solid protection overall, try to use SS armor for maximum defence
---
it wasnt a mistake or it wouldnt have said 150 everywhere
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
A holotape exists that tells you exactly what silos are open and their timers , it’s priceless
---
You're getting a fair bit of heat in this thread.....people should calm down I think.
---
You're idea is not without precedent - Bethesda did something similar for charisma, preventing any armor based bonuses being taken into account when sharing perks. It used to be possible to share pretty much any perk when bloodied and unyielding.....
---
Now, you could do the same with intelligence but then that wouldn't create a level playing field, rather it would shift the meta xp build to a PA based heavy gunner probably. 
---
Better instead to remove the impact of intelligence on xp at all and give everyone the same base xp benefit for achieving the same thing. No reason to remove inspirational perk / certain food / team xp benefits though. This way everyone gets the same credit and same buff opportunity
---
Past few days I've used 25 modules trying to get an unyeilding SS left leg...nope. Really pissing me off.
---
Meg is tsundere. She's really a softie on the inside.
---
It's all combined in to one count.
---
Check and see if your shotgun has the increased bash damage legendary perk or an armor piece has damage reduced while blocking legendary perk. Both cause the shotty in vats to bug out and do mega damage compared to what they're supposed to be doing
---
This is pc Xbox ps4 community event. Not separate.
---
Uh I see, these features are nice to have but I don’t find them to be necessary to have, they just improve your experience and that’s it (imo)
---
I don’t have 1st either but the only thing that interests me in it is the scrapbox since I find it very game changing and also necessary to have. But unfortunately I only play this game casually and I often take breaks of it when I’m done with whatever content available at the time, I don’t think paying for a membership is worth it but if Bethesda ever decides to sell the scrapbox individually without having to renew a membership for it then I’m totally getting it regardless of the cost
---
Gotta lessen those storages somehow!
---
ITYS
---
Yes. Shotguns suck. Vats is actually bugged right now, that's the only reason they don't completely suck. Hopefully they don't fix it as it at least makes shotgun builds viable to play with.
---
Yah I was going to do at least one.  But I’m not even online long enough to farm resources these days so I probably won’t be able to donate any
---
Well the roadmap still says 150,000,000, so I'd guess they realized they messed up.
---
I think they would be 100% open to people abusing technology if it was intended to be given over to them. The Brotherhood fears technology in the wrong hands but have proven time and time again that they believe they are the only right hands.
---
with how high it is, i know it sounds it, but they don’t even need to play the game, they just need to pull a report of our inventories. 
---
Even the new 15m sounds like a huge number. I may give them too much credit but the whole thing could have been intentional to get to understand our limits or how we react.
---
I don’t know, i think someone pulled out the report, saw the amount of concrete we had and went from there. Then again they weren’t smart enough to realize that the banner (along with the provisions) isn’t enough of a reward...
---
Under appreciated comment here. Well played.
---
thatd be more cloth imo
---
yep, tho hopefully it's not too late with people being discourage over the original goal.............that or they can just fudge the numbers, i wouldn't complain. ;)
---
i want that banner and collectron for my BoS themed character's camp.
---
This is incorrect in multiple ways. You are mistaking the Tadpole Backpack (skin) with the Small Backpack, the Possum Backpack (skin) for the Standard Backpack, and you can apply any mod to the small backpack and have been able to *since it first implemented*.
---
They had to do something to avoid the embarrassment of ending 90% short. Although the fact it had to be reduced so drastically also shows how badly the community didn't engage. And there's no cooking the books as theyve made no effort to hide the shortfall. Neither side comes out of this as a winner.
---
Because the reputation system is a joke and there are no real consequences
---
Maybe the vats button could switch pages while the favorites wheel is open, as the melee button is the same button to swap a favorite item from the "quick boy".
---
We definitely need perk sets too, something you could swap to and from within the favorites wheel as well without opening the pip.
---
We don’t have exact numbers. What do we know then: 
---
At any given time the average players on steam is around 8k, has peaked over 30k but tends to be around 8k throughout the day. 
---
We know steam is one of the smaller parts of the player base. 
---
We know it’s a top 30 title on Xbox right now. 
---
If you extrapolate out a little, it’s not unreasonable to think 30-40k people on right now across all consoles/launchers. Honestly this is a pretty conservative number. 
---
We know from Bethesda that the average play time is around 4 hours (which seems high, but let’s go with it). 
---
24/4=6
---
30k x 6 is a conservative estimate of 180k daily players. 
---
If you have a better estimate I would love to see it and your reasoning. If you have additional data points I would also be interested to see them. We are working with imperfect information, but that doesn’t mean we cannot reasonably estimate based on what we do know. 
---
There was also math during mischief night that put us at about 50k online every hour calculated off of how many sentry bots (397,709) were killed x players per server.
---
397,709/24/7= 2361 server instances the event was run
---
2361x24 =56,672 average online per hour. 
---
Obviously these numbers are dated but I think we can assume with game pass that more people are playing today than last October. If we assume a 4 hour average play session with October numbers it would put our estimated player count over 300k. 
---
Again, if you have better math, I would love to see it.
---
Totally agree.
---
Well that's just you.Not everyone is like you. There are obviously people willing to donate. I know this because the concrete is always gone from the farming hot spots, because other people have looted it.  Which means other people can't loot it and therefore not as many people can donate. That is the real problem.
---
EXACTLY, and for me it's also the single-player FO I wanted in the first place.
---
Got a perfect pair of legs just last night, unyielding and fall damage reduction with strength +1 on one and endurance +1 on the other plus a unyielding wwr right arm I use a bloodied build so couldn’t believe my luck now I just need the chest and a better left arm current left arm is bolstering wwr Rad resist
---
This issue is so occurring it's driving me crazy. Did anyone ever create a ticket or should I? I have tried every combination of different types of weapons and changing them different ways and nothing seems to work every once in awhile out of nowhere if I pick up another random weapon it will swap between my two last weapons but usually it just goes to fists.  
---
 I found the only way to allow it to switch between my two desired weapons is to keep a third weapon on me and not only do I have to have that weapon I need to have ammo for that weapon if I drop the ammo for the weapon I'm not using it just goes back to fist
---
Yeah Bethesda fucked up. I get the idea, but it was executed terribly.
---
They just stopped it on assualtron helmets also.
---
Nope, I'm not doing it either.
---
Right now when i play it's just fast travel here, take some pics, fast travel here, fast travel there to grind for gold, rep and other shit.
---
I mean, I've been doing wards bullshit since wastelanders started and still not full rep with them.
---
I ran into a colossus for the first time yesterday. It disappeared as i was killing it.
---
There's enough crap stuff to do for little reward.  I'm not going to do this either.
---
I hear Grounded is pretty good. I'm going to try it.
---
The sound plays but doesn't double the crafted amount. Same thing with crafting as armor.
---
So do you like PA/what weapons do you use cus I'll give you advice on how to spend it
---
And 1st is the perfect solo playing version, it's perfect for my preferences.
---
Sorry, meant the under armor
---
That's awesome, I didn't really care for the banner but I'm glad they acknowledged how ridiculously high it was and lowered it!
---
Hopefully they do the same with Cork cause it ain't gonna be much different haha
---
It also doesn’t work on SS armor.
---
So let armor worry about my defense and just go offensive. What about perks like Lone Wanderer, Adamantium Skeleton, Suppressor or Dodgy?
---
Yeah that could work, having perk load outs on quick access might be too strong in combat though so I would stick to them being stuck in the pip-boy menu, but the vats just reminded me, you can't use any aid via hotkeys on pc while in vats, I think that should change too, as I sometimes get "stuck" in vats and then can't heal quick enough
---
SQL?  Their database is paper, pencils and a million highly trained hamsters.  Show some sympathy, please.
---
I dunno if I would still be playing if it was only single player. Personally the crew that I play with is the largest reason I still play.
---
The Problem was trying to get people to like a group of individuals who would commandeer technology from a public only trying to rebuild their lives
---
Only join hordes of animals - always easy to complete since they have an icon right over the boss
---
Why....what did they do to you
---
What a mess. I fucking love it 😍
---
Both issues are the problem, zero reason to do it if rewards for it don’t exist and who has 50,000 concrete other then dupers
---
