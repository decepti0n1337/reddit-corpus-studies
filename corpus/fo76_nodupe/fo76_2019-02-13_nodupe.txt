Dude/dette, don't read, downvote, don't reply, you won't hurt my feelings.  Giving me the attention I crave is nice though, thanks.

Then you shouldn't have commented on this particular fucking thread, which was explicitly about what you just said doesn't apply to you. Jesus Fucking Christ.
---
Just FYI: you can get 8-10 stimpaks from the Mayor’s office in Watoga every 20 real hours after you complete the Mayor for a day quest.  
---
Plastic:  Also Watoga High School,  White Springs Resort (but you have to figure out where to look and you're looking for things like golf balls \[that's a big hint right there on where to find them and there are a bunch of you know the right places\] and plastic plates / forks, and other miscellaneous plastic.)   The good thing about White Springs is that even though these things are spread out, there are some other good stuff you can get along the way like a decent amount of Abraxo Cleaner (acid), some leather, some various flowers of different types, some decent kills and the chance for legendary drops when you run into the right kind of ghoul, and not to mention about 7 really easy to find telephones (with there being a lot more than that, but if you aren't finding 7 of them just by walking in the door and looking around, you aren't really looking.)

as a guy, i feel like the vast majority of clothing items in fo76 are aimed at women. i dont need a belly button cleavage + spacesuit. i dont need polka dot dresses.
---
&gt; I can't think of any mainstream online rpg with pvp elements that allows you to radically change your build on the fly.
---

---
Neither can I think of one that has a universal point based skill/perk system with more of them dedicated to the ability to haul more shit and item durability than to combat.

I'm sure you'll be back to tell us what you think about the dlc.

Hey, sorry.  I know it's getting late in Ireland.  After approximately an hour and a half, I was able to find a Uranium fever.  I thought I captured all 3 mole miner bosses, but it only recorded 2.  I show the 1st drop that wasn't recorded in my inventory.  Based on me running the event, and this non fully conclusive as Ive only ran it once today, this supports my stance.  I received 3 legendary drops from 3 legendary enemies.  2 were level 40 and one was level 35.

---
(The quality may be horrible, as the Xbox DVR is absolute shit.  You can still read the words just fine.)
---
This does support the fact that you can receive items a few levels lower than the level of the enemy.  This does not support receiving items higher than the enemy.
---
There is another addition that I forgot to mention earlier.  You can receive max level items as a reward for completing the event.  This is completely RNG however.  But this doesn't pertain to the arguement at hand.
---
I was hopping to be proven wrong by me running the event myself.  As this would have given me a reason to actually grind the event Everytime it happens.  
---
But nevertheless, I'm interested in hearing a rebuttal.
---
Maybe, can't deny you there, but it sure as hell will be awhile.
---
I may not have been clear enough.  I'm not "worried" about them.  I just want to know how these giluys are getting their hands on so many, and where I can go to maybe get a legendary that is can use at my level.  I definitely don't intend to pay my hard-earned caps for one.
---
I'm not sure how it works for the helmets. I do know that if you are looking for a spawn location the busted house next to the vendor in hapers can spawn them. 
---
You must scrap a helmet to make a helmet.
---
You can learn the material mods for the helmet from scrapping armor, but to learn to make the helmet itself you need to scrap the helmet itself. They do drop in the world anywhere headwear spawns. Search this forum for Combat Armor Helmet to find a post with pictures of spawn locations. Depending on RNG, it will take about 1-6 helmets to learn. If you are on PC, I can help. I can make all helmets in the game. IGN: jchamlin

Got it.

&gt; Yeah that. not sure if it would work to keep people from disconnecting since it would load nearby people only. That is, if it works.

Not trying to be an asshole here, but what's keeping you from trying that yourself? Would you prefer someone else to risk getting banned instead?

So, go ahead, and tell us if it worked. ;-)

Unless I'm mistaken PA increases damage done with power attacks as well.

EA has taken quite a few Ls lately, they **need** anthem to not fail.
---
Wow lol you thought the only explanation for me replying to your comment in the main post is... that I'm a troll... not that I pressed the comment button at the bottom of the app inadvertently while doing something else. You think the only possible explanation is that I'm a troll. And you think that's what trolls do. They reply answering questions but in the *wrong place*.
---
Just... what?!
---
Also my post history makes you think I'm a troll too... my post history? That's mostly selling stuff in the '76 market subs. I don't think you understand what a troll is.
---
I'll tell you what a troll does do though. They post ridiculous things like saying we should impose downvote limits on the sub. Like you did a few days ago.
---
 i don't use grounded and charging barrels. just energy weapons are very bad in this game. it doesn't gain any benefits from armor penetration effect. 
---
i thought the reinforced combat armor was red.  whatever my chest piece and arms are they are red, but only standard in game upgrades.  sorry, i should have included a screenshot. 
---
Why do you think that this is bannable? 
---
**"  we’ll be sure to post them here and all patch notes and weekly updates going forward. "**

Are you sure? 
---
Ok dont want to sound like a snob, its better then I could do.  But maybe a glowing green background would be better, the pink cloud with the red inside the stimpak feels like a missed opportunity at contrast.
---
But hey its your art and your body, you do you.

Excellent idea!   Thanks!

Games good, 25 years after bomb destroyed and displaced everyone and mostly everything. Every other fallout game takes place centuries after.... Think about it and tell me how having no npc makes it not a fallout game. WV is becoming completely autonomous...so robots....this had a huge impact on life before the bombs fell. You would know about this if you stopped to read the lore instead of bitching.
---
Or paint jobs for excavator armor. 
---
I have never seen that option. With both characters 
---
Youre clearly crying on the inside... had to edit the post and mention the downvotes to help your ego huh? lol 
---
Well if you ever farmed mobs at whitesprings you'll know it's more often 30% than 10%. Also you can easily "fix" the disorientation issue if you keep the mobs in front of you.

I haven't played in weeks cause of repairing bug and more issues.
---
I wouldn't make any assumptions about their intentions. Canceling mods would get them nothing but ill will, so it makes zero sense.
---
They're probably figuring out how to monetize and create whatever private server system they decide to use. And then I wouldn't expect it to come until they're ready to wind down internal development, since traditionally mods will take the place of Bethesda updates. 
---
They said they'll come in about a year, which still seems likely. I think they'll probably spend most of 2019 tuning up the game, releasing modes and vault content and events-- all while getting whatever from the atom shop-- then step back from the game and release private servers/mods to act as supplemental income while they put their main efforts into Starfield and ES6.
---
make sure to suggest making all armor paint fit and retrograde existing ones
---
Meh, I'm not worried what a bunch of upset children do with their votes.
---
Hey ass, i'm 40, player all the games and read the lore....This game lacks content, full stop.  Fanboy all you like, but this is a trash experience.
---
I am crying because I've been a fan of the franchise since the 90s, and this game ruined my love affair.
---
godsend, thanks
---
its been out for how many months? 
---
When EA is doing better customer service and offering a better game--- you know youve really screwed up
---
I agree with your main point, but feel obligated to point out that you should make your comparisons using percentages, not subtraction.
---
Enough for me to realize it's a scam. Hope the rest of you see the light.
---
Let it be known that it is Bethesda Austin who is taking care of Fo76 and you can look them up and see that  they have no experiencing with making and maintaining games especially ones as big as Fo76.
---
How does it lack content? You probably blasted through it and didnt read the small notes and letters. Im 97% sure you didnt play all the holotapes. 
---
I wont be buying skyrim as a protest for fo76. They need to learn to care more about what they release.
---
Sorry, I don’t wont go on the game-wide generalizations (energy weapons are very bad) based on a single data point (AA perks don’t affect enemy ER) journey with you. 
---
Again, what does the “damage” tooltip on your weapon say? 
---
You’re right about armor penetration, 
---
You may or may not be aware that enemies have different DR and ER stats, with DR typically being higher. 
---
So an enemy with 200 DR/100ER has you lop off half of its DR with stabilized (so calculates damage reduction as 100DR, if you attack it with ballistic), and the same enemy will sport an unmodified 100ER for incoming energy attacks. It comes out in the wash. 
---
The time it takes me to mow down, say, half an SBQ health bar is largely the same as with a 50Cal, and much shorter than with a gatling, all being 1* bloodied weapons.
---
I don’t know what’s happening on your end. 
---
Honestly apex legends already saved EA originally anthem was THE product and apex legends was just a fun game to help out, the roles sorta reversed 
---
Level 78 and never seen it.
---
How does this game change any of the others? ESO wasnt my cup a tea but ill still throw on oblivion from time to time. Its not fallout 5 and never claimed to be. Your shotty opinion does not define the game thats all im trying to say. 
---
Tell this to rockstar
---
It wouldn't matter...  The game should be getting better with every patch... Instead they rebreak things and then go silent for weeks.
---
Yeah that would be nice too. There are posters for the excavator armor in-game that are blue. That would be be a nice paint job
---
Yeah but Idk if even EA expected it to be as big as it is, they already invested in anthem so much, now they have two big games instead of just one, for two entirely different markets
---
I still have no idea how they did scalability testing.
---
Is it too late to get a refund? 
---
Finally. I've spent the last 3 weeks doing nothing at all but trying to get in this place. Finally i can are the sun again. 
---
Someone being able to shoot at your from slap damage position is also broken. They should have to accept the "contract" by clicking on the wanted player on the map and choosing to make themselves PvP enabled. It shouldn't be a one way street. The wanted person should be able to preemptively defend themselves.
---
No...... more stash=greater instability for the servers that are already struggling. Maybe just clean up the need to have such a large stash to begin with (weapons and armor breaking much slower, not needing tons and tons of different materials) would be a better fix. Players would feel like the game was less tedious, and you wouldnt have a need to carry as much stuff.
---
Oh I know! I feel like it's not a thing because it's a new armor set so they just don't have it working. Which sucks because I'd buy atoms for a nice paint job. 
---
This might be EA’s year and honestly respawn and BioWare deserve some hard earned success (if either game is shit though that’s on them)
---
I hear you, but my shotty opinion is all that matters to me
---
&gt; Did everyone up and quit at launch or what?
---
Of the 79 ppl I see on LinkedIn at BGSA, the bulk of them look like they were hired in March 2018 to work on 76.  I doubt they've left.
---
FO76 would actually need a producer to be to do that.

They are currently trying to hire 3...

I can go on and on with your brilliant ideas. You start by saying remove PVP then as you so aptly point out in your point 2 you say you want to have PvP(?) Have your cake and it to huh. but in different worlds for faction PvP? By worlds you mean servers? so some servers are no PvP and others are? Great idea splitting up the fan base cuz that always works well derr. Then you want to remove the survival elements in the entire game derrr I’m dizzy from this idiotic logic. 
---
I’ll go back to my first comment.  You’re one of the babies that never liked the premise of the game to begin with and would rather play the older single player fallouts but but but with friends tho. Even tho the devs specifically and repeatedly pointed out they were never going to make the game that way.

Fucks like you can’t get past this point and are now hopping on this bandwagon AGAIN because Beth fucked up their game even tho it was a good idea they fucked up its delivery.

No, raider armor plans are frustratingly only part of a quest reward, you either get light, medium or heavy

From signal strength yeah I just wasn’t sure if they’d also been miscoded somehow as being available on a vendor since beta while not actually being available 
---
Thanks, appreciate the help, Also i'm on Xbox so I guess I will go hunting.
---
Thanks
---
I know it’s semantics, but since this is an online game and everyone will have to have the same version to play together, shouldn’t we stop calling it DLC? DLC was always for individual, small pieces of content we add to a game. What we would be getting is a major content patch
---
THISSSSSSSSSSSS

Thanks for reading all the way through. It’s a true story from top to bottom. I’ll pass on the info here to what happens after I get a chance to log on again and return the favor.

I'm wondering when were are gonna get a john deer skin for the buzz saw.

Less about proof, more about trying to see if there are variables to find, and thanks!

---
 
---
Now does it go on PA thread, perk thread or?
---
&gt; Charisma for sharing is just a way of balancing out your character, since perk combos can be insanely OP: eg rad sponge + ghoulish.
---
That doesn't make much sense given sharing makes *other* players' characters more powerful and not your own. So you could share whatever you wanted on a gimped character with a bunch of min-maxed characters who don't have to give up anything for it. And seeing how this isn't a ranked competitive team based game I don't see how it makes sense to expect players to sacrifice themselves for the team–especially when all those points just sitting there for the sake of the sharing mechanic would be wasted on misc. Charisma cards if they don't have a friend available at the moment.
---
"We appreciate your feedback and I'll definitely pass it on to the dev team"
---
IDCK?
---
/s
---
i hate the idea of them spending more time on the atom shop, but i'll admit i would definitely buy brotherhood stuff. like, maybe flags for factions like they had in 4? or maybe BOS paint for different armor? i dont know 
---
Bethesda doesn't necessarily have the resources EA does. There's a large gap in their revenue.
---
Skyrim or the next Elder Scrolls?
---
Well, it clearly is an exploit, or is it not? If you're using it, Bethesda will insist you stop using it at once, and that is even if it means *less* server load (but we don't know that, and I'm not even sure that this game's servers are configured to react this way; you might just get disconnected and get a Bad Connection error message, or you might end up with unbearable lag and low frame rates).
---
So if I keep going back to a vendor, does it delay a reset?
---
I'll check again later tonight, but think that's it
---
I, along with my buddy, stopped playing a few weeks back. We both have made a conscious vow to never buy another Bethesda game until the GOTY version is available, if that. There will be no more purchases up front or pre ordered. This is the impact this game has had.
---
We both slogged through the bugs, hoping our patience would be rewarded. We are both insanely huge Beth fans, with both of us consistently preordering the highest edition for the past several games. I doubt we are alone in this mindset shift. It really is a shame.

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
DR use PAPERDAMAGE to calculate damage reduction.
---
ER used WEAPONBASEDAMAGE to calculate damage reduction.
---
This is huge different in endgame.
---
and sbq health bar is not accurate. it is not only your damages. it is combined every players damages at the same time. 
---
I'd like to see a gilded power armor paint, and more weapon paints or skins. It would be nice if they had a suggestion box on there website or on here
---
How is the game supposed to know what you want to use those materials for? And if you want to horde them for future use?
---
but, like the carry weight glitch, it might act as infinite caps
---
I've found that some companies get really quiet when you don't say what they wanted you to.
---
I just went through all of the hidden “content” and Cut IDs... suffice it to say I completely understand why game is in state it is.   There’s no content hiding out there, except the vaults and the presidential election. 
---
How about the bounty caps don't come from the player but the game. So if you get a bounty for getting wanted you don't lose caps. But if you do something more severe like attack a camp you should get a out of pocket bounty meaning you'll lose caps for being more brutal.
---
I believe it must've been, or fixed. There have been multiple conversations about this and confirmed posts of Brawling not affecting Fist Weapons (as they are still technically melee weapons and Brawling states "unarmed", whereas Iron Fist/Talons states Punching Attack). Or it's possible your armor piece has +Str or something else.
---
 How is it not an MMO?
---
Have you considered the possibility that it's you that is disconnected from what most players want?  They have hard data, you don't.
---
They know what people are buying, and they know who is spending cash for atoms. They know what has sold, and how much, and how fast.
---
This subbreddit is an echo chamber for a very tiny portion of the playerbase. Don't forget that.
---
Same here.
---
Now you made me want a Glow-in-the-dark Ghoul outfit for my raider.
---
I’d buy that for a dollar!
---
It's not the engine, it's the servers. Online games have to keep track of all those items server side, rather than client side, to deter issues with duping. So it will never be infinite. 
---
That said, they have responded to this by increasing the limit from 400 to 600 and saying they are looking into how to increase it further. 
---
not a very good idea as it would render stealthboys useless.
---
another reason why this game was never meant to work on a pvp level. it's not balanced, but if you change it then it's not fallout anymore.
---
everything is broken on a fundamental level. op legendaries are just the tip of the iceberg.
---
Time travel. 
---
I want the winterized T-51b skin (If you don't know this is a special power armor from the brotherhood outcasts dlc) Winterized T-51b Old enclave x-01 Power armor would be nice.
---
I think another issue the team has, which has led me to quit playing for the time being, is that it’s either A) too small, B) the engine is too difficult to work with making minor fixes difficult, or C) they’re having a hard time adjusting to multiplayer style updates after being a single player/letting community mods fix the small things for so long. Any or all of these lead to minor changes over long periods of time. I mean, the recent update is literally “scorchbeasts shoot less lazurs, loot is better.” They basically made an MMO/Destiny style game yet they update it as slowly as a single player game. In a multiplayer game they should be getting out hundreds of minor fixes PER MONTH and not be afraid of making MAJOR changes like animation additions. At this rate they probably won’t get around to adding free content until end of Q1 or beginning of Q2, won’t get to adding expansion sized DLCs until probably mid 2020. Point is this is a slow crawl on what should be a lot faster.
---
Now I get hours of work, budget, etc etc, but don’t tackle this kind of game if you can’t handle it. Also, NOBODY I know of that loves Bethesda was asking for a DayZ style survival game with 16 players. Bethesda fans asking for multiplayer meant Skyrim with a friend or 2 or 3. Fallout 4 with a friend or 2. Both of which are insanely easier to achieve. Might I add this is the same issue people had with ESO at first. They wanted Skyrim with friends, not an MMO.
---
I might also disclose I AM a Bethesda fanboy, and I love FO76, but it’s not what fans wanted and they don’t have the bandwidth to make it work in the long run without a major overhaul of the game and team.
---
Yea i want to know the damage output.  Sounds gnarly.  
---
You can't pick them up, they are other people's items but it's been having too me for months. Kinda used 2 it
---
I would rather SB useless. At least reduce covert agent and make them last a lot less. A mark 3 without the agent perk lasts a few minutes!
---
Does this take into account that some legendaries are not compatible with others eg. furious and Two Shot?
---
I’m on Xbox if you can’t find one, I’ll make you one.

One place the level 15 can spawn is the Lumber Mill top left of the map with the Super Mutants. Another place is in the back of the trailer at Gorge Junk Yard. But in their infinite wisdom the developers put a level 3 lock on it. So you'll need a higher level to unlock it for you.
---
I'd take a guess that a big content drop will be announced at e3
---
They'll probably resell a new edition of skyrim before ES6.

Basically, you can see them if you have the pc version and download the modding software, but the modders havent published any because theres over 5000 tables.
---
People who buy a game aren’t stakeholders. We are consumers. There’s a big difference. 
---
PC
---
Very cool. Sounds like you already know this, but it's all related really. As long as you know figure/ground and a little color theory you can pretty much do it all. It's just learning the tools at that point.
---
I found some in the toxic vally i believe clarksburg tallest building.  I had to log into several servers, to get almost a whole set
---
So barter town? 2 men enter one man leaves 
---
don't you see nerfing everything to the ground may not be the best solution? the tse nerf already made a lot of people drop the game.
---
but I say this mainly because everything in Fo76 is broken on a fundamental level. this game is essentially a mod for Fo4 to add online. so everything in it was designed with singleplayer in mind.
---
the only way to "balance" things is to make everything as effective as a wet noddle. it's not good game design nor fun.

It’s just fine solo and you won’t miss out going slow. You never have to go in a nuke zone, team up, or go hard for legendaries. 
---
I love pink! ... I tried green, but actually thought it was too much of a contrast, so I went for more of a complementary background. No snob at all. I wouldn't share it if I didn't want input :)
---
There's no real reason to schedule game time in lieu of other responsibilities I might have currently.  If I've got nothing else going on I log in and try to wring my 1400 caps out of the game for the day.  That usually entails hitting up some high value loot and running Harper's Ferry, Whitesprings, Enclave, Responders, and Raiders before I finish up with the BoS and Watoga vendor.  I check to see if the Enclave has the X-01 Jetpack while I'm there and before I log out I drop extra junk/plans/legendaries at the Watoga rail station.  
---
It's a party!

Did Iron Galaxy port the Fallout 76 title to consoles for Bethesda, or did they make more of the game itself?  Because I know Iron Galaxy lost a ton of people while they were finishing up FO76 but I don't know how much of thta job they were actually responsible for.
---
it is fallout 4. and this game using same fomulars.
---
Eventually.
---
I'll repost my same reply from the several other times I've seen this recommended:
---
The idea  would basically remove any vestige of  character specialization. It's  literally six attributes at 12, one at 11.  It's hard to pretend you  have a different character layout  when the largest stat difference is  likely 3 of 15.
---
Even  beyond that, if  acknowledging that there is generally at least one  attribute that most  players don't find that useful for any of their play  styles (for me,  that is Endurance, because most the perks meh and you  really don't need  a maxed out charisma), you could leave that stat 'low'  and have a 15 /  15 / 5 / 10 / 10 / 15 / 13 build with every combat  attribute maxed, L3  perk sharing and emptying out vendor caps supplies,  all the durability  loss reduction and crafting you'd need, and crit for  days - all with  lowest stat still a 5 (my melee build character has a  charisma of 1).   If you are solo and perk sharing and team perks are useless for you,  geez now you are 15/15/5/6/12/15/15 and still have  lonesome wanderer  and demo perks too.
---
15s are supposed to be unusual, not half of everyones build.
---
\----
---
To address your specific attempt to compare characters between FO76 and priors, I would simply note it isn't the same thing.  You are a single player hero in those other games.  In multiplayer games like FO76 you are just another vault dweller - no a super hero.  Like playing any other RPG with other people you are intended to have some deficiencies to contrast against other players.
---
No clue. Without finding where the code messes up... does it negate it due to the perk being treated like a non-PA armor ability upon the transition into PA stats? 
---
Does the perk itself not recognize the gun as a heavy weapon when the transition into PA occurs and then doesn’t correct itself because the code has it check if it applies only upon either switching out guns or the reapplication of the perk? (This might be true because to fix it you have to un equip and re equip the gun too)
---
I think for now maybe it should stay in the perk category since we know at least the perk buff is the issue but maybe not the cause.
---
Thats the idea. Maybe have a few fighters(obviously with cool fighter names) on a list you could challenge with different caps for being able to Defeat them.
---
What's up?  Do you have something to sell or trade?
---
New content is supposed to come next month. It would have been earlier, but bug fixes took priority.
---
look me up.  game name:  Immelmann
---
Common sense and critical thinking. Well stated.
---
I've thought about this for a while. Just got signs and letters and can make it possible.
---
Sounds good. I love energy weapons so anything to help figure out a balance for them.
---
Fallout 76 has the worst RNG and loot system I’ve ever seen in a video game. 
---
The fact that the elite enemies and end game bosses will literally drop a plank of wood or less 90% of the time they’re defeated makes for one really terrible game. Let alone a “triple A” one. 
---
F
---
Pacify a deathclaw and put two people in their bare knuckles. Whoever kills it wins. 
---
I’ve seen numerous threads here say the formulas are different. 
---
The threshold was moved from 80% to 91% for starters. And if there is an ER bug, it sure wasn’t around in F4. So with all due respect, I’m skeptical.
---
Can you please explain then how (either paper or perk-modded actual) damage is affected by the DR calculation, and how you understand that calculation to work? 
---
I’d (genuinely) like to understand better. 
---
Regardless of dev feedback anthem is going to be just another badly made loot and shoot microtransaction sink with a little bit of game attached to it. EA is a century away from getting the benefit of the doubt for anything. 
---
responder vendor in grafton, not the one in the train station, he’s in a building on the south area of grafton 
---
mods are out.  i use one that makes meat pile glow.  easier to find them now.
---
They could hang out with those devs and talk about their shared love of not putting text chat in PC games and losing some sales because of it.
---
Agree. I don't want to wear a summer dress or have a candy cane paintjob for a crappy weapon. 
---
The only thing that I did actually want was the Blackbird paintjob but I didn't want to spend real money because I was sceptical of the game. 
---
&gt;I wish Bethesda gave a fuck like EA
---
I wish they gave a fuck for all their games. RIP Battlefront II.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As long as whales and fools are willing to part with their money, they will continue to run a shabby scam on their customers. 
---
Just imagine how badly they’re going to force microtransactions into Fallout 5

Got a friend who has been farming Atoms since the Unstoppables costumes came out. He bought the Mantaman one last night. My brothers wife already had Grognak, so on a whim I went and Became the Silver Shroud and my brother became The Inspector. We ran around in those costumes for what rest of the night. My friend intends to get them all. I think they know exactly what most people want out of the Atomic Shop. 
---
Collect them, it's what I do
---
Only if it’s a Telemundo Soap Opera!
---
Chemist + super duper
---
Shine on you crazy vault dweller!
---
I kill SBs
---
Thank you for your input. I'll be sure to pass this along to the community managers!
---
Putting it into caps doesn't make it make more sense. The meme isn't applicable. 
---
I remember seeing them downtown Washington too in fo3. Just figured it was like 1950s Art Deco stuff like I’m batman TAS or bioshock. 
---
Oo I like it. Shame the pets only go to lvl 25ish.  Have to make it a naked fist battle for there to be a challenge.
---
They have a number of bos paints in game files including elder, I believe this is being saved for faction vs faction pvp.. There's also enclave presidential t60 paint. 
---
If they brought out a cool looking Excavator paintjob, everyone would jump on it. 
---
I mean yeah I never said they didn't, I was just saying what I would like to have.
---
Chemist and super duper perks for one. Chemist doubles the amount produced, super duper gives up to a 30% chance to duplicate whatever you’re crafting. 
---
As far as raw materials:  
---
Blood from ticks. Two tick sacs and some antiseptic make a blood pack. 
---
Get antiseptic from Abaraxo. There’s tons of it scattered around Whitesprings.  
---
He's your hobo looking princess then.
---
Yeah man it's totally not worth it 
---
The only think i can think of to prevent all card swapping for a passive ability for QoL is to run it as a tier system. The issue i may see with that is theyll have to rework the strengths of each card to fit a tier 3 card. So everytime you level up, you can choose a QoL card or other perk card like you normally would. So if it worked in tiers, and say STR was a tier 1, you could equip all tier 1 cards at the same time. But to increase the tier I'd say itd have to either be upgraded either via special stat, or maybe even upgraded in place of a perk card. 
---
Idk man. But i am with you on the annoyance of having to swap cards constantly just to do certain things. Im just trying to figure a means to an end.
---
Have checked through that too, it’s mainly Fallout 4 dlc from what I can tell 
---
Have you tried making healing salves? They’re a good back up when your stimpaks are in short numbers. You make them at a cooking station.
---
I had a big comment typed out. But I realized instead of arguing with you or even acknowledging your rude comments, I just wanted to tell you that I’m sorry. I’m sorry for whatever it is in your life that makes you feel like you have to act out this way. I’m sorry for whatever or whoever has hurt you to the point that you can’t have a civil conversation. I’m sorry for whatever is happening that makes you feel the need to insult a complete strangers looks, all because you disagree with their opinions of a video game. I’m sorry that you have so much hate in you that you have to call me fat or say I have little sausage fingers. 
---
I hope you find the help and companionship you so clearly need. I hope your life gets better. I hope you find happiness. I hope people aren’t too mean to you when they see the way you acted on this. I hope you can find love in others and yourself. I hope you get better.
---
I would just assume it does all stack like that. I can one shot a scortched beast in the air with my dragon if i use a vats crit in stealth. 
---
Simpler solution. Treat stealthboys like the invisibility spells in ES. As soon as you fire, the effect is broken.  Perhaps make it a short lapse instead of negating the effect entirely. This would allow them to remain useful for players to escape a losing fight while keeping them from being an OP advantage if they’re actively attacking. 
---
You could try using the railway rifle climbing trick to climb the sides...
---
Compare Fallout 76 to Path of Exile or old Diablo. You can get literally any item from literally any mob. Low to mid tier builds are based around a theme instead of a specific item and high tier builds usually require ludicrous amounts of currency to get the items they need.
---
If you load into Fallout 76 on a new character and go 'Oh boy this build is going to kick so much ass when I have full X-01 and a 3* Bloodied Crippling +1 Agi Gatling Laser' then you're in for a boring and frustrating grind. If you load in going 'Oh boy this build is going to kick so much ass with power armour and a rapid fire energy weapon' then suddenly your grind is a lot more tolerable.
---
Now, the other problem is that the Fallout 76 gameplay loop sucks anyway so even getting what you can use feels like wasted effort, but having to grind for days, weeks, months, to maybe never see that perfect item is not a bad thing for a loot grinder game.
---
just craft bolts. they're not particularly expensive I don't think.
---
either that or hit Slocum's Joe and the mine again and again for pipe weapons to scrap. you'll need to be at least level 10 though, for Gunsmith. but seeing as how you brought up the crossbow I guess that won't be a problem.
---
Fair enough def a cool design.
---
Lies
---
Brilliant! The generic reply of my life must be sad  because I’m negative towards you.  Lol so typical. 
---
Scripters be crazy. 
---
Struggling to make 76 hours XD
---
*Psst* they mean actual approved mods.
---
High risk, low reward.
---
That’s 316 days of play time
---
While I do agree that I will **not** be picking up the pink armour, I have very little complaints about it being out. Especially for Valentine's week.
---
Yes, it's nice to have something for everybody (etc. etc.) but I'm just happy to save my atoms up. I've only started to purposefully do the challenges over the last week or so but I'm nearly at 5k now (most of which I already had). When I get to that mark I will treat myself to the nice wooden floors and the unstoppables bed I think. I have a nice camp build planned and those will help with that.
---
We can't have a firebird paint every week and I'm glad we don't. I'm determined to stay free to play and that would make it hard!
---
Tested a few spots. Generals steakhouse netted about 30+ raw violet with green thumb. Aaronholt Homestead netted about 40+ raw violet. Tryed getting another farm along with Aaronholt inside the blast but none of the flora changed in its garden.
---
Fair enough. In this case, treat it more like Hunter/Hunted and the person accepting the contract only gets a general vicinity of the wanted player (which is still more than they’d get in normal PvP). 
---
I don't think I liked a single item from the store so far. maybe the monocle and the gold paint for the .44, but the fact it's *only* for the .44 kills it.
---
lots of "joke" items like the child's play paintjob for PA and now this. not enough "edgy" paints like the Blackbird- which I missed. because I'm a moron.
---
or chrome. I love chrome. would love a chromed t51-b with a .50 cal to go with it.
---
If you’re over level 70 I recommend doing the “One violent night” event every time it is available. Crowned level 62 Charred ghouls every wave of enemies and they almost always have at least one stimpack and quite often more. In fact, that event for chems in general is amazing. I vendor/ trade more than I could ever use almost from that event alone.
---
My understanding (and it may be flawed too) based on how this was explained to me is that the bug is not with energy weapons applying to enemies per-se. That works fine, and shooting a maxed damage end game stack &amp; weapon at an enemy will hurt. 
---
The bug comes into play when you try to reduce enemy DR (using weapon mods or perks) - that none of this affects enemy ER correctly, and *that* calculation uses the wrong number as you said. So the impact is inability to use the  “stabilized” perk and legendary anti-armor energy weapons, not inability to use energy weapons at all.
---
Now, if you’re heavily reliant on Anti-Armor as your first weapon legendary modifier, this is kind of a big deal. It means anti-armor Gatling is basically a vanilla Gatling. 
---
But if you use other legendary effects that boost damage instead of trying to reduce enemy resistance, like furious or bloodied, you’re sweet.
---
If anyone knows better, please correct me. My knowledge is purely anecdotal plus personal observation. I haven’t looked at game files. 
---
Old bug. 
---
No you clearly have a ton of hate in you. I’m sorry. I have nothing to say to you, because you are clearly not doing well. 
---
it's a bug that's been reported again and gain since november. ***yeah***.
---
Pharma Farma.
---
Okay i got this. 
---
Community: Hey i got all these amazing fabulous ideas, why cant you just listen to me?! 
---
Bethesda: \*cold shoulder\* 
---
End. 
---
Can you kill Greg?  I’ve never tried. Assumed he was like Phoenix and indestructible. 
---
Or if you're an optimist it means they were thinking of adding dogs before they threw in the towel.
---
Sorry I was not aware of this bug.
---
only~ 6600 to go for me
---
"Designed"?
---
 The word you are looking for is 'drew'.
---
Yeah maybe no perks. Base dmg only that would make it interesting. 
---
I meant more like "holy shit I can't believe they ***still*** haven't fix this"
---
You can buy 3 in the enclave for cheaper then 800 each. You got scammed. 
---
Fallout 4 has like 6x the number of quests in the base game
---
Completely agree!
---
And yet you keep replying. 
---
It is, but it is content we can see later 
---
Oh haha good old Bethesda, but yeah it is pretty sad.
---
sbq is not good to test your weapon because it is raiding boss. i suggest kill mirelurk queen alone to test your weapons. and if your saying is right, threshold change means energy weapon worse. 80% threshold means at least you deals 20% damages to high resistance enemies.
---
That did not go like I hoped.
---
Should be 10000 atoms. 
---
Keep crying on your posts I’m sure Beth will change the game for you. 
---
There’s some great paint in the store - but I hate that it’s only available for some weapons or some armors. The chrome would be amazing on other weapons, some of the armor paints would be great colours for a PA etc etc. 
---
The paint jobs that get released never seem to be for stuff I can use - case in point this time I love the pink paint, but I’m not giving up my 3* BOS combat armor set for some crap metal pieces just so I can have it in pink. Am really hoping we get a new PA colour for V day. 
---
Baron von yup..
---
I wish I have seen a tse weapon, I'm almost level 100 and it seem that even though they added a lot to the vendors, it seems impossible still to find plans like marine armor or even power armor. 
---
Maybe they didn't want people to actually grind 76 hours or 760 just so they could be "first"
---
Goodness man, simple post about someone's thoughts really brought out some hate in you. Like good God bro, 
---
You’re right. You’re clearly the winner of this. Congrats. I shall go away and admit defeat. 
---
Throwing knives were a bit effective, they just weigh a bit.
---
Thanks you almost hurt my feelings there. 
---
yes yes yes. For both stimpaks and antibiotics.
---
Yeah, I think for now the real question is with the ones past F4. I plan to go back for the classic ones later, who knows what we'll find! =]]]]
---
Ultimately Bethesda has never really communicated much. People have said this for years. This right now is the most we've had in a long time with community managers, inside the vault, etc.
---
I don't see that as any kind of indicator that they are giving up on the game or letting it die.
---
They still seem to be learning how to be more transparent and communicate (Todd did say in the NoClip that they are trying to do this now) but they need to learn a bit quicker. An online game needs expectations set or people run wild with ideas and what's given is never what people have just made up themselves.
---
I just hope their pulling an NMS. They keep being compared to games that took years (in early access) to improve and yet they did a "full release" in this state.
---
This will go one of two ways: they'll explode with something awesome... At some point... or they'll cancel it all... At some point. 
---
this is not bug. it is bad design for energy weapons. 
---
Clearly that’s what I’m doing. Thanks for taking the time and making an extra comment to share your insight. It’s very valuable.
---
I've been trying to figure out what the random respawn is.  Time based maybe?  The last time it happened to me was right as someone else was entering town, so I think it maybe respawns them for that person's benefit and screws you over again.  At least for that last instance where I was paying close attention, they were leveled to me, and the respawns all leveled for the new guy instead.
---
Care to prove that?
---
You’re welcome fuckface!
---
Red Rocket in Morgantown, Near crashed satellite is a town you can build in, east of Charleston fire dpt is a town you can take over, northwest corner of map is a huge campground you can build at 
---
  I have it and Good doggy, coupled with a piece of legendary regenerating armor I end up with surplus Stimpacks to sell.
---
Seems legit to me. 
---
Great point. Much of the work that’s being done involves fixing issues they created be that at launch or in later patches. Extensive pre-release QA and data reporting could have prevented so much of what players are struggling with, but BGS did not prioritize those analysis functions and now we are sitting around while they clean up their own mess. 
---
Ok
---
Once you're ready for mutations, get Healing Factor.  Make sure you have Starched Genes and Class Freak perks equipped.
---
Also don't buy serums from the game vendors.  Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits to buy the serums.  You can get em easy for a lot less caps.
---
Farm workshops. I had like 100 reg 100 super just cuz I was taking grafton steel and munitions to keep my ammo up.
---
72 percent of all facts are made up.
---
They are items in their inventories, not dropped items?
---
Lol. I'd want that just to read the 1000 complaints about griefers 
---
Probably a year from now.
---
Hum... what items? I don't think I remember any quest item like that... do you remember the name of the item? 
---
Yeah that's totally true. Some dick killed me 3 times in a nuke zone a while ago and I lost a fortune.
---
Well... 300 caps or something. But those were my caps!
---
  When I see old metal Fans and clipboards I want to loot them.
---
I mean clearly this hit you on a personal level, otherwise I don't think you'd be keeping tabs on it. 
---
Is it a girl or a guy? We can talk about it man.
---
Slightly north east of Tyler county fairground is a really nice unmarked lake yo7 can build on
---
This is a situational weapon for laying down damage for extended periods of time. 
---
MLQ is actually a terrible example, because I can shred one with a handmade in 2.5 seconds, and a minigun/LG hasn’t even spun up in that time. You need a much better damage sponge. To test. 
---
SBQ is the best test for this. 
---
Crap wrong area to post in, my bad.  Deleting.
---
It’s only been 25 years since the bombs fell. Being able to walk about without a hazmat suit for the majority of the map speaks volumes to how little WV was affected by the war.  The radiation levels of everything are similar to MA 200+ years after the war. 
---
Fucking pink armor. I want Enclave stuff. Shiny black boots, more monocles, special mustaches, banners, flags, podiums, search lights...
---
That pink pipboy would look great with my tropical suit would buy but 600 atoms feels high
---
My name master yours blaster 
---
They don't even pay the crickets enough to stick around
---
Nothing you said here is in the ballpark of what we're asking for. It's like you're taking what we're asking for and putting it though a bad language translator, then translating that back to English.
---
at least in MonHun High Rank / GRank monsters drop materials according to theur rank on a constant basis, also they;re more fun to fight
---
Thank you, you're awesome! We can also later try to study the cult of the mothman and those shrines! Have you been to the Big Maw? That's a creepy place. There's a paper nearby saying that people felt compelled to plunge to their deaths. I think this a big clue for what the Interloper does with people's minds! =]]
---
Have a Gatling Laser and Tesla Rifle (Anti-Armor)
---
[removed]
---
SBQ is best test if you can test alone. but it is not.
---
No. To my knowledge, he is cowering under a rock somewhere and refuses to come out. 
---
All jokes aside Todd needs to step up and get out in front of this mess. At least to show support for his staff that are trying to fix this mess. 
---
Come on Todd Coward, slither back out and step up.
---
Agreed.  Saying that you want to be more transparent and communicative, and actually doing it, are 2 entirely different things.  
---
Bioware fumbled Mass Effect andromeda but they realized their mistake and doubled down on Anthem.  They did the RIGHT THING by DELAYING THE GAME until it was actually ready, and they have had multiple developers and other team members actively posting on Reddit for months.
---
For the record too if you look at the reviews of the initial release of ffxiv they are actually lower than fo76. Believe it or not the reception for that game was actually more of a disaster.
---
Hop inside a building or change servers, the encounter has zero benefit.

No only about 20 xbox friends

One you complete "mayor for a day", you can loot the safe every time you login for 8 free stimpacks

At QuakeCon 2018 Todd “Sweet Little Lies” Howard said during a Q&amp;A on Aug 11th: "That is definitely something that we are doing. We are committed to it. It's not just having a private server, it's being able to mod It.”
---
No, no, I don't have a YouTube channel or any other ulterior motifs! I just like conspiracies, that's all! I thought this was the place to meet others who also like it. I really don't wat to be a nuisance, if people think this is just silly, I'll stop! =]]
---
remember. your grey bar attacking sbq is not only your damages. it is combined every players damage in same time.
---
Only thing I can think of is during the PC beta I tried to see if my computer could run it and maybe my friends list got tied to the computer version of the game I tried asking the support but they just sent me the "generic" support for friends not showing up 
---
I noticed that as well. It’s usually when someone else enters the area, but I’ve had it a few times where it’s been random. Like, everything will respawn and I look specifically if anyone has entered the area and can’t find anyone. Finding consistency in flaws is even difficult at this point. 
---
I’ve made an effort to not go into a place if someone is there so I don’t screw them over, even if I have a mission there. 
---
You can reduce stimpak usage by drinking Nuka cola. I have nuka red in my favorites. I wear an auto stimpak armor but try to use nuka before that happens. 
---
Enemies drops can do it too. Usually happens that it's legendaries when I see it. I haven't been able to pick it up this, it usually jumps to an enemies inventory
---
Does anyone still believes this game is going to live much longer?.. I was among those who defended it on release, but now, man... 
---
Yeah, me too! That was the coolest part so far! There must be more clues somewhere! =]]
---
Hah, what?
---
You can disable the tag at any time. It is impossible for the game to know when you have enough. 
---
If they cut the number of players down they could increase it that much. But playing with only 12 people per server is a bit light.
---
I'm just gonna say it you guys are scumbags looking for a quick buck

You're obviously not getting it:
---
Rad sponge reduces the rad count of all of your team-mates. If you share it, it now starts reducing your rads. Sharing rad sponge benefits everyone including you, and should be an auto-include in any min-maxed character fighting in a rad zone.
---
For perfect synergy, one of your teamates needs to share ghoulish so that rads heal everyone's health before they are removed by sponge.
---
This is a no-brain, meta build for anyone not playing solo. If you're playing solo you don't need to worry about perk sharing at all do you? If you are playing in a team then it makes sense for this wombo combo of OP'ness to cost you some special.
---
Top of the World; the Crosshair; the West maintenance closet of the Gorge Bridge (key atop Camden coaster); Rusty Pick basement... and yes, that trailer.  If you're on Xbox I'm happy to give you the tour, and I am a level 3 lockpick.

People can get banned for false reporting.
---
Should add for due diligence, I'm on PC.
---
Oh sorry for confusing you, it's was just my thoughts about the topic.
---
I just kinda got involved in this
---
Love all the fallout games. Pre-ordered 76 and decided to cancel. Glad I did. I have sympathy for all my brothers and sisters thay did go through with the purchase. Hopefully Bethesda honors their product and makes huge strides to make this game what you all thought it would be. 
---
very odd.. I assume you've submitted a ticket?
---
I bought a second one that someone had apparently sold to MODUS the other night...hoping it wasn't you.
---
By the way, I’ve shared this post with several friends and they all think it’s hilarious. I keep rereading it and laughing at all the things you said. So thank you for that. 
---
Haven't you heard, the kids love the Fortnite for it's wacky skins.
---
That is true but it’s tedious and time consuming... didn’t know it would be impossible though 
---
Ah, I see your concern. 
---
And I’ll double that concern by reminding her stats scale with group size. 
---
But It’s actually easier than you think. There are many situations where the people fighting her are not meaningfully breaking through her skin or doing it very slowly. You rock up with a major damage stack, watch the fight and can see it’ll take 20+ minutes for her to die. 
---
Pull out a weapon and fire. Her health starts going down fastZ 
---
Stop - and it slows back down to a crawl. 
---
That’s where you run your test. 
---
Pick a distance from her (there’s also range damage dropoff), and see how long it takes the 50 cal to take, say, a quarter of her health, change weapons, and how long it takes a GL to take another quarter. 
---
Repeat this whole thing 3-4 times, and don’t use results from fights where there’s clearly other heavy hitting players. 
---
While the time between fights isn’t comparable because her stats will be different each time depending on group size, the 50 cal rate of health erosion and that of the GL should be comparable. 
---
Never mind, saw this one.  
---
"Maybe"...  
---
As good as theory as any, especially without follow up from Bethesda, based on your troubleshooting, it's clearly the account and not the Xbox, try making a new a character?
---
Thank you!
---
My brain was going, 'well it reloads automatically (compared to lever and bolt action' so it must be automatic!!
---
cool. Thank you for the differentiation. I appreciate it.
---
thanks for response. im tired because english is not my first language. sorry for my english. i'll exit now. 
---
Look at you go kiddo, just can’t get enough can you? Oh wait I’ve seen your pick. You’ve never had enough in your whole life. 
---
Do those make noise? Or just when you hit them
---
I've given away a lot of marine armor plans. 
---
Not so sure about power armor. 
---
I'm just staying the eff out of Whitesprings.
---
76 could potentially be an exception. It was intended to live up to the claims of saving humanity, housing the best and brightest and not experimenting on them. It’s not unreasonable to believe that info from experiments in other vaults would make its way to the overseer of 76. 
---
I really cant get enough of this. It really cracks me up how angry you are. You should keep it up, we could all use a good laugh tonight and you seem to have a lot to get off your chest.
---
Not at all.
---
The crossbow isn't bad. It's one drawback is the slow rate of fire. You may want to carry more than one pistol. Like a 44 and a 45. This helps with the ammo problem. I currently carry a 44 pistol, 45 lever action. 308 sniper, crossbow, 556 and a black powder. Each has it's place. 
---
Oh I remember,  I was there.
---
You're not going to get any co-operation here. Best thing to do is head to r/Fallout, have a nice cold Nuka Cola, and wait for all this to blow over.
---
You think you turned this around on me and I’m sooo angry, funny. Keep up the shit posts and crying about the game. 
---
I can’t see it as related, as the guy who made it intended to go back, not forward. 
---
I always do this for players that are a low level or that seem in trouble. For example I had about 80 Stimpacks a couple of days ago, so I was trying to give them away. Dropped some for a couple of new players out the vault and in some supply drop crates for people to find too.
---
Once I've sold junk to vendors and I get half way through chems I always have a surplus. Just seems right to give them to people that need them!
---
constant chiming
---
Yeah you’re clearly calm and level headed. Only a calm reasonable person would insult someone based off their profile pic and lash out like a child having a temper tantrum. You must be a Buddhist Monk.
---
If it's vault tec I buy it. That's about it lol
---
Would anyone be able to post a picture of the sweet roll recipe? My brothers birthday is thursday and i won't be able to pick up a copy until after that.

You've commented like 5 times now. This is CLEARLY personal. Are you a developer? You must work on the game. BOO. BOO LEGENDARY DROPS 
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
---
Healing Factor mutation.
---
Of course, it's all right! Any idea help us a lot! And we WILL study the classic era too!! =]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
---
You are of low intelligence 
---
Odds are it would have been something along the lines of a ‘Fluffy Cupid Cloud’ or ‘Plutonic-Pink Marshmallow” bed so... are we *really* missing out?
---
Brahmin pen is under resources
---
You can backtrack out and that’s what I should have done to get all the wonderful lead and fans out. So much good scrap. But if you die inside you have to get another keycard and have the bios changed on it to get past first laser grid gate to retrieve your loot. The robots you cleaned out will be respawned. 
---
It would be a great place to farm if you could go in and back out easy. 
---
How much are you looking to get for it? 
---
Are you a whole team?
---
If you still have it by morning I can hook you up.  I’ve got cobalt. 
---
If your on PS4 add me Hillbilly202 is my user name. I’ll help you. None of my friends will touch 76 so I have to play alone. 
---
Exactly right. To make PvP work you need 24 PvP players to allow forming of factions and groups and what not.
---
You can solo PvP or group up and do squad based PvP. 2 player PvP sucks.
---
Anyhow almost March.
---
Awesome! Ya i still have it. I will be able to get on tomorrow evening about this time if that works? I need 2 cobalt to build my jet pack haha
---
I work night shift, so about this time wouldn’t work. 
---
When your working on a tablet using multiple different types of tools, 'drew' seems a little misleading. Some people say 'digital painting', but I don't think that's accurate either. Coming from a graphic design background, i think this is pretty accurate... but, that's just, like, my opinion, dude.
---
another day older and still no 3* loot.
---
I use melee and rifles. I use rifles to take out turrets but apparently what your supposed to do is change targeting parameters of turrets to attack robots for you. Where I was just shutting them down totally. The last four turrets I couldn’t find the terminal for in control room because I was too busy getting my ass shot off. 
---
Did you read the plans?
---
People complain when there's new content and when there's not. 
---
I was hunting a bounty who was traveling through an occupied/owned workshop. Take him out and evidently my level 100 character murdering someone in front of a level 15 was too ominous as the kid (based on the sound of the voice) started pleading over the mic “no no no no. Please don’t take my workshop”.  Lol, no worries kid, my beef is not with you. Gave him a thumbs up, dropped some stims and ammo and went back to roaming the wasteland. 
---
Having never played BETA, I am one of the latest Assaultron Head used-all-1000+FusionCells-in-one-shot victims.
---
Amazed this was even allowed into release when it can remove soooo much ammunition in one go... would be nice to get my ammo back and the item removed until fixed.
---
A year-long "roadmap" on how to fix and presumably make an actually competent game, three months after the game has been released.
---
I remember a time when games were completed and quality checked BEFORE release \*sips Monster\*
---
I was thinking 350 caps 
---
Thank you so much for these write ups! I'm fiddling with a plasma flamer based on your last such and it's looking very promising!
---
That's a bit low. I'll give you more. Add TheAfricanChild
---
It’s called a fertilizer collector or something of that nature. Looks like a wheelbarrow and requires razorgrain. Once dropped, a Brahmin will spawn. 
---
My guess is a lot of devs would love nothing more than to talk/vent about it, but management doesn’t want to commit to anything yet. They’ll have to do a cost analysis first.
---
That's because their team consists of a few holotapes, a wooden left arm and a robot named rose
---
I want to open up the rooms/floors at Whitespring. You could get certified to be the inspector, go to vault U or something, only to find out that the builder robots have gone rogue, or the Whitespring bot in charge of the Reno has been hiding a massive bug/whatever infestation that needs to be cleared out. 
---
I also want more music. Maybe we find a robot dj in the mire, who’ll be full of conspiracy theories and new salvaged tunes, but he needs to be powered up or defended or something, so there’s an event to turn him on and he broadcasts for 2-3 hours after that. That would keep me on, as long as the broadcasts weren’t identical each time. 
---
And I’d SO side with Rose. 
---
I couldnt agree more. I realized storing 90% of the stuff that i was would be a waste. I give away most weapons i get, no longer hoard armor (no way to display it, whats the point), i only keep ammo on my person. The only thing i keep in my stash is junk, ore if i cant smelt it, and junk. 
---
Chems and all that jazz, i find em or buy them. I only keep canned goods too. I dont even loot meat now (unless it is challenge related or i plan on hooking someone up). 
---
I only have about 500lbs worth of items stored
---
Shit well do you work weekends?
---
I don’t see it as a nerf into a wet noodle. TSE’s are still very powerful, you just need to be built to make them strong. Same with every weapon in the game. Only weapons nerfed too hard is explosive weapons ie; missile launchers. 
---
I just want stealth boys to not last as long. They should be much shorter, and if not, we should be able to at least VATS
---
Nice roll!
---
No
---
This would be perfect. 
---
It's on the Bethesda launcher on PC. Its Fallout 1, 2 and tactics. It was available in early January because I downloaded mine.
---
Everyone already got them. Install the ebtheada launcher on PC, log in with the bethesda.net account you use for fo76 and install away.
---
Then google your question or use the sub search so you get the answer instantly.
---
If you’re Xbox I can make you some tomahawks. Really fun and powerful early game.
---
As a fan of the series you might have known better then to buy at launch
---
Shit that too, I forgot about that. 
---
It's also illegal to give bad references, at least in the UK. You confirm they worked for you but you can't say they are a bad worker. 
---
That's assuming you're a bot running 24/7 without any significant disruptions to service.
---
Even a more realistic but still crazy assumption of 8 hrs/day, 7 days a week will take you over two and a half years.
---
That's sheer arrogance right there. Even playing 760 hours for a lot of people is assuming a lot.
---
I like it, it’s relaxing 
---
😁
---
Let's not forget that the same fallout 1 and 2 that dragged in us old fallout fans was also full of Monty Python and doctor who references. Fallout has always been a blend of dark brutal post apocalypse and comical absurdity.
---
If you're out of stimpacks after 16 Scorched... wow.
---
Is today "post the same exact threads that were posted the day after launch but pretend it is something new that hasn't been posted before" day?
---
Seriously
---
Oh I pre ordered ps4, do I not get it? 
---
Isn't 2 years a little early to gentrify Flatwoods?
---
Kk ty
---
I'll give u 2k for it. Add me Y3_R 
---
Request sent. If I don’t catch you today I will be on to do the test tomorrow (5pm central) and get them back to you along with a write up of what I have found. 
---
Additional problem with CAMP Placement
---
I previously assumed that, if my CAMP couldn't be placed upon entering the game, it was because of competition for that location or someone else's CAMP overlapping mine.  I'm noticing that this is happening even when the location is unoccupied, even if there have been no changes to the CAMP.  I guess this is another bug. 
---
Haha yeah that would fit in that new update. But damn that cloud bed would fit perfectly besides the princess castle bed! 
---
I feel that the early levels (between 10-40) are the hardest of 3-present on normal. You’re always repairing, and your gear is junk unless you have a friend to make it for you. 
---
I found a spot I liked and just grinded it and scavenged. 
---
The “Kill Laugh Love” sigh is great, I bought it immediately 
---
I don’t know what you’re trying to say with this response 
---
If I find a second one and fast travel, one spawns at my feet and is unable to be picked up. My assumption is this is one dropping from my inventory because I’m only allowed to have one for some reason. 
---
I’ve also seen a garage door plan at Site Charlie that was laying on the ground in a similar fashion. As I know the plan, it won’t let me pick it up as it says “read” instead of “pick up”. My friend who didn’t know it was able to pick it up. 
---
I stand corrected about the road map, in this link bgs states an aimed release of a road map "by the end of this month at the latest" this comment was about 4hrs ago so relatively recent.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apvn1u/bethesda_is_very_quiet_for_a_team_that_has_been/egc0ssn?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I’m saying do the lien on the offending player, but don’t hold out on the bounty hunter being paid immediately. 
---
The bounty hunter shouldn’t have to wait for the offending player to put in enough time to pay the bounty off. 
---
You need to have more communication outside responses to existing threads from non-staff is the main point.
---
I want shiny gold leopard print PA paint, with many many Carots of encrusted diamonds throughout. Make it happen! 
---
As a parent, and as a grumpy old dude who also hates snow, this made my day. Seriously. I'm in New York this week on business (working on a Top Secret comic book franchise thing) and all day is spent in conference rooms and making me miss my kid and wishing I was home to play Fallout with him. Came back to the hotel room tonight, and logged on, and read this. Standing ovation, my friend.
---
You get it for PC. Fallout 1, 2, and Tactics are PC-only. So if you have a PC, you download the Bethesda launcher and then log in with your same Bethesda account you use on 76 on PS4.
---
Be a man and own your bounty i say. 
---
if you have one let people try take it even say lets do 1v1 even if there is 4 people make them battle you 1v1 makes the game so much more fun when your taking down a line of players :).
---
BTW i have a bounty from the last time i played i will be on tonight about 6pm australian time on ps4 to get rid of my bounty of make it bigger and see who comes to play ;). see you all out there be kind and rewind 
---
It will show that you have all the items, however it won't let you craft unless they are all in one place (ie they are either all in your stash or all on your personal inventory). This has been a minor bug for quite some time
---
12:  This is a result of the wanted player not having any caps.  If their bounty exceeds their current amount, they lose all their caps and gain a “disease” called bankruptcy that causes -50% damage to players.
---
Ideally, the player killing them should still get a payout since in theory they’re not getting the bounty from the wanted player, but rather as a reward from whoever they harmed. 
---
That's what you get when there's more than five people working on an online multiplayer game.  You get constant update and accommodating community managers.
---
Thanks!
---
so, did you get it done ? :)
---
February 11 2019 I logged on and had 70 stimpaks disappear form my inventory. 
---
I have a huge plastic bag full of plastic bags.  I'm almost certain that I  may have a slight hoarding problem.
---
Good stuff! Since I play solo most of the time, i normally move on with my life. I’ve got shit to do! But my new little friend has opened my eyes. I can play solo and still be a decent human being!
---
I'd get that! 
---
Let me shed some light on exactly what OP is talking about. I have rolled with a player doing exactly this and yes, it works exactly like OP has stated. 
---
1). One player in the team passes his caps off to someone else, leaving barely enough to travel. 
---
2). Other team members scout places to get a bounty
---
3)  Broke player causes hell and gets a large bounty
---
4). Chumps come to claim bounty, land hit on wanted player, get wiped out by teammates enriching the wanted player’s team. If wanted player dies, oh well. He loses whatever caps he has on hand. 
---
5) Rinse and repeat. 
---
Welcome to keep or sell it, that mule is at like 10,000 points of weapons
---
You sound like a complete tool.  I love people that criticize others for criticizing.  Well done.  
---
I farmed two different nuke zones today and killed a crapload of enemies.  The infamous spinning loot circle appeared on 90% of them for several minutes.  I even went back later and no loot to drop.  To that extent I say FU Bethesda.  Why bother?  
---
Thank's, I wont be on for a few hours as i'm at work, but also not in a rush lol 
---
Joining your game, can't fast travel.
---
It depends on geo location of the server, quality of connection, number of people in the server, amount of items people have on the server, outstanding events on the server, and location specific spawns. Very random and inconsistent in general in my own experience 
---
Beats getting wood armor or rolling pins...
---
Not looking for curtain calls, just hoping a player or 10 to sees this and understands that it’s not always about them. Sometimes it’s about the screeching prepubescent kid that genuinely wants to help anyone and everyone. And maybe we should try just a wee bit harder to be just like them. 
---
They need to remove legendaries and replace them with uniques.
---
I don't know. Sometimes it seems to run good. Fast loading. Jumping in and out of PA is smooth and fast. Other times not so great.
---
I was trying to think of something that fit with the song... Just an attempt at humor.
---
Thank you. Someone understands 
---
You need to stop talking in order to listen.
---
I miss semi-intelligent talking armor.
---
Easy fix: increase photomode limit. At this point taking funny pictures for my load screens is one of the few fun things left and 50 is ridiculously low.
---
Oh so that’s why I get rad worms basically out of the blue.  
---
It's not about the single player, it's about the lie. Rockstar promised there would be single player dlc for GTAV, but after realising just how much of a cash cow GTA Online was, completely abandoned development for single player entirely.
---
GTAO is extremely predatory. Designed to make the game frustrating, practically forcing you to buy shark cards just to get access to any of the new and extremely expensive stuff they release. They clamped down hard on nodding communities and won't allow modders to add GTAO stuff to single player.
---
So yeah, I'm just not going to support a developer that blatantly predatory. 
---
For real.  Folks can be real children. It's the Internet though,  not sure what I expected
---
Where did you find the plans for those? 
---
Not to burst ur bubble, but I'm 132 and it gets no better. 
---
Then beth needs to correctly display what bounty you will get from the player. I don't want to waste time and resources on broke assholes.
---
I get most of mine doing Uranium Fever and some from other events...
---
&gt; Pretty sure there is some kind of damage contribution threshold you have to meet. Like 10-20% or something crazy high 
---
there is not such thing as a damage threshold, you can loot her as long as you have done even 1 damage to her.  
---
Some times you just need to wait a bit to load or other times (never happened to me) it may bug out and don't drop anything but most of the time it just takes a lot of time for items to load.
---
You just make shotguns and scrap them to learn mods
---
People who employ this tactic pass off their caps to their teammates to make sure they’re broke when someone comes to collect.  The bounty only comes out of their caps, not their team’s, so it works out for everyone except whoever comes to kill them. 
---
Enjoy, sorry have to adult, kid does not want to stay in bed.
---
NICE 
---
No worries!  
---
I love connecting the dots!
---
This is why I gave been thinking of converting to a pipe build. Move as much damage to perception and get access to armor pen. You basically want a 15 in perception agility and luck and then a few points elsewhere.
---
Found someone who hasn't lost a TSE to the hopper..
---
Nope. Never.
---
i think it was to level lock the higher tiers, since you only get master/expert at later levels. Meaning you had to go back to "harder" locks/terminals when you are higher level or coop with someone who was.
---
Don't hear this guy everyone gets loot from the SBQ as long as they have done even 1 damage to her.  
---
The problem is that with many people around it takes a bit of time for loot to load.
---
It's a good sentiment.
---
I dunno. You knew you were offered something for free. But Lordy you can’t find the information to get that free offer even though the information is all over the place.
---
It's like Jesus. Just have faith. He possibly existed at some point, but, those are just stories or myths, or urban legends. Who knows?
---
All good. As a note you gave me a anti armor Gatling laser and a berserker Gatling laser. If you meant to give the gauss rifle. 
---
Either way I have a basic Gatling laser to compare. I will shoot you what I find tomorrow.
---
So I bought a CSG so I could mod it but the mods aren’t available. If I scrap it I won’t be able to build more because I don’t have the actual plan, correct?
---
Also, I thought I had to scrap what I find to get the mods, didn’t realize I could just build/scrap. 
---
Oh.... okay well that explains a lot, thanks!
---
TSE rolling pin when
---
Correct. If you don't have the plan, I would head to the Ash heap and fight some mole miners. They tend to have combat shotguns. Then scrap those for mods. 
---
Yeah, I thought it was passive, 21 levels in and now I know this...I hate myself, thanks btw!
---
Indeed!
---
That's weird, since when I load up my character, it's STILL not loading. My PA suit says I have zero health, 100% radiation, etc.
---
I ran into a lvl 8 player that was stressing about stuff so I hooked him up with a gang of stuff- adhesive, screws, you name it.  Need to pay it forward 
---
Not fully sure, but I guess it's Pendleton, in Whitesprings. His plans are better than his portfolio in Atomic Shop.
---
Yeah everyone, no one listen to me. It's not like there aren't other reports of literally the same thing happening to others. Also even if it's loading issues  then why the fuck is it still an ongoing issue this late into the release of the game that it would take so long for loot to load that the corpse disappears. Also I don't want to hear crap about it being my internet. I know full and well it isn't an issue.
---
Hey I might have a few melee weapons in.my stash.
---
When. I jump on tonight bout 6 I can let u know .
---
PSN is chronic_coit
---
Bethesda has stated private servers and modding wouldn’t be coming until a year after the game was released. But considering how tumultuous the launch and post-launch has been, it’s possible they may try anything to help invigorate life into this game, and private servers and modding would certainly drive players back!
---
i am a user, but i don't love my job.
---
Chores. Cap stash runs. Max my vendor sales. Grind xp for QoL cards. Farm up resources for ammo. Chase Lore.
---
I am very hungry for content update tho
---
So they are trying something new? Too bad it isnt a game engine
---
Great feedback.  This is a great community!
---
Not to mention awful balancing practices. Nerfing the entire explosive weapon class that was already in a small niche and difficult to use just by weight and resources needed just because of a weapon enchant on ballistic weapons.
---
While melee characters rock everything in the face with one-hit kills and just generally romp across the game with very extremely little resource grinding needed in comparison.
---
I think what it is, is they want Metro, Fallout edition.
---
It would definitely give you incentive to not log when a scorchbeast decides to attack your succulents. 
---
No problem, man. Don't hate yourself. When I read about it at first I had hardly tried it and was like "What are they talking about?" It wasn't until I made a supply run build that I understood haha
---
Here's what I want, in a short list. I want them to drop a item of gear that is useful \_at your level\_. If you're level 35, drop level 30-35 gear. If you're level 140, maybe stop giving me level 15 things when I kill a level 52 legendary?   
---
Take. Fucking. Drills. from the legendary loot table. The fuck, guys?  If it doesn't drop with a legendary modifier, it shouldn't be part of the bloody loot table for legendary loot.   
---
Up the odds of a 2/3 star legendary dropping 2/3 star loot? Like, on average I get one 3 star (always, always garbage) drop for every...ten? 3 star enemy? At best?   
---
In general, I'm at about 300 hours. I've farmed for I don't even KNOW how many hundreds of legendary gear. I have four armor pieces I don't hate, most of which have 1 affect.  
---
I'm using ONE, one star legendary I looted. A furious rifle. Everything else? Someone else's cast off.   
---
It's all nonsense. The entire system is, as you say, demoralizing. 
---
Agreed, I will never be purchasing another EA title again. After watching battlefront 2 go up in flames and all the rest of their games being heavily discounted it feels like they could be in their death throes. This gaming industry is slightly toxic when these developers become so big they can make their own rules. R* just found a vein and tapped it like a heroin dealer. 
---
I meant you not to hear the guy you were commenting. 
---
Yeah, I got one explosive rifle at 136 and the second in like the 190s.  I don’t think I got a two shot until the 200s. Up until then it was tire irons and wood armor. 
---
What's your gamertag so if I ever run into you I know you're not a threat
---
PahlyBoy
---
The time will come when some random player named MamaMurphy runs by you in a Civil War dress wielding a rolling pin!
---
I found the plan for the arms yesterday on an armor workbench. There has to be a bug from the last patch, they have been completely removed from vendors and they are damn near impossible to find elsewhere.
---
Not to start. I mean, it's been three months and the Responders are still laying all over the place. At least get them buried by the one-year anniversary of the Vault opening.
---
You dont get fallout 3. But the games you do get are on PC only.
---
Which workbench was it
---
I thinks it's that, plus the fact that no matter what they do people hear complain anyway.  They can't please anyone no matter what in the first place.  So... Yeah.
---
I didnt do a Google search, I was already on reddit and thought about it and decided to just ask real fast. But thank you for your majestic charm in helping out.
---
Gypsies, Jehovahs witnesses, people with mental health issues, etc were gassed.
---
Point still stands this is a game, there is no moral requirement to resign in protest over a bad management decision.
---
I'm curious, what field do you work in and how often have you resigned or fired a client ( assuming you have your own business). 
---
Awesome.
---
Didn’t GTA online have invite only sessions? I’m baffled that this game doesn’t.
---
The Life Saving one. Cavalier is best for melee for sprinting up to people. Sentinel is best for standing still. Cloaking sucks. Seems pretty useless to me.
---
Ah, I see. I changed my comment. Definitely misunderstood what you were saying.
---
I have no actual numbers but just from friends, talking to people in game, and this sub. I know a good amount of people who bought the game and none of them are still actively playing it. A few of them will hop in here and there but not consistently, which is the same boat I'm in as well.
---
It's easy to reason why, it's a game designed around PVE with almost no new content since launch 3 months ago (they only added a few event quests) and a very underwhelming endgame that get stale pretty fast.
---
I'm sure a lot of players will return (at least briefly) if/when they add more content and raids but I have no clue when that will be since they seem to be in fix-it mode and rarely update the community about their plans.
---
Please fix the bug that makes teamates completely invisible, this is by far the worst. I spend half of my time explaining to my wife that I didn't run off without her and that im right next to her. We play with screens side by side and when this bug happens it does not go away until you load a new world.
---
No only thing that fixes it is using an entirely different xbox account 
---
Req drop.
---
They probably assumed this is a game people would play for years... didnt realize people would eat the content so fast. I rarely ever find anything new and if i do its just some nook or cranny i never noticed lol
---
Thanks! 
---
I usually go find a new player and have them kill me. Its a win/win. 
---
That is a rock-solid tip. 
---
I’ll be on for a couple more, my GT is the same as my name. 
---
I've been on both sides of this..it's a good place to be. Hoarding chems is the way. 
---
Damn. My bad. 
---
Because your original post was just oozing with so much charm. Sure there’s way more posts that are far more negative.
---
There’s still negative in your post. The implication that the game is unplayable. 
---
I am a big fan of Life Saving
---
Just give up haha 
---
Well you guys all pissed in my Wheaties. Bummer. I'll just enjoy it for now and leave it at that
---
I can see this being very possible if several new perks are eventually added to the game.
---
Still no weapon rebalancing. Seriously,... what a waste... i haven’t playied since a couple days after the insane nerf blanket that ruined the game but yet I still get on here everyday hoping that it’s gonna be in the upcoming patch notes or something. Why Fxck every gun in the game and than do nothing to reconcile the damage they have done to the game and the players that even gave the game a chance after playing it for more than to days. God that’s fucked up
---
Trying to get a full suit of any specific legendary is...impossible in this game. The drop rates are fucking garbage.   
---
Good idea in general, though. 
---
And the pay is shit. I tried to get into a QA position for Nintendo of Europe a few years back and they told me testers get $19.000 net a year (€16.000 to be exact). Their requirements are ridiculously low, you don't even have a highschool diploma.  
---
This sub was sunshine and rainbows until they fucked up four times in a row.
---
There is only so much people can take waiting for things to shake out.
---
I’m sick of grinding in that game to be honest. I yearn for adventure..... sounds like a great find though congrats friend! 
---
Why don’t people understand when people feel wronged and let down venting is what we do, it’s in our nature. We want closure, we want value for our money, which this game clearly doesn’t provide a big majority of its players including myself. So everyone needs to understand views will differ but in the end this game is a glitchy mess that should have stayed in beta Much Much linger!
---
Agreed
---
I noticed this also. 
---
Pretty sure that is meant mostly as a playtime tracker since they didn't release on Steam
---
brutal, making a UI page tonight and will add it.
---
Only took like 10 mins but this lvl 43 finally got the hit I wanted him to kill me lol.
---
I just sleep in a bed sometimes and wind up with enough extra stimpacks that I get overburdened
---
lollygaggin'
---
I’ll upvote that to get the revolt started. We are  the spark that will light the flame that will burn the First Order down.
---
And you can make a dozen of them on one trip from Flatwoods to the Overseers camp
---
&gt;I don’t see it as a nerf into a wet noodle. TSE’s are still very powerful, you just need to be built to make them strong.
---
dude, level 5 demo expert adds ***less*** damage to my shotgun than a level 1 shotgunner.
---
&gt;I just want stealth boys to not last as long. They should be much shorter, and if not, we should be able to at least VATS
---
pvp encounters usually last about a minute. you'd need to nerf them to last less than 30 seconds in order to be "balanced", and that's a mark 3 with max secret agent.
---
*essentially nerfing them to the ground and making them as useful as a wet noodle, similarly to what happened to TSEs*.
---
I can’t begin to tell you how hard I just laughed at “sad grim joke”
---
Ah, Camden Park you meant. Good to know, thanks.
---
Does the extra meat from animals perk give you more blood packs? 
---
I’m on pc and when I can set gear and guns for
---
Lowbies at v76 and at someone’s suggestion the vault dweller camp
---
I have a feeling we aren't going to like it and I'm curious to know how much of this road map is going to focus on PVP servers.
---
I use that skin to hide my bloodied searing rocket sledges true nature 😁.
---
Apex had a roadmap the minute it came out. Why would you need 4 months to get one out if you should have that plan already laid out
---
Funny how the people from Bethesda named off BS stuff that they noticed we asked for. The only legitimate one is the scorch beast. Nothing about the loot being horse sh** when you kill legendary enemies 
---
If she doesn't register explosive damage as has been stated around here, this explains why I can never loot her, I'm a pure explosive build (not explosive legendaries, explosive launchers).
---
The colorful games are more fun for me. I don’t like boring muddled Skyrim. I like the online version of the game though. And I want to play a real rpg, with leveling. It’s like Bethesda forgot how fantasy RPGs traditionally work.
---
Sorry, found the Gatling(s), I had a matched pair, figured it would be easier to test with.
---
No, it can't.
---
Meh, just ignore those bullies. They're a dime a dozen round these parts. They lack imagination. They are the masters of the single entendre, and the intellectual griefers in the world of the mind.
---
Probably just melee builds anyway. Grunts.
---
So keep those posts a'comin! There's plenty of us that are totally digging what you're putting together. Why, Ladydevann said so herself!
---
I take my PA armor and Regular armor and put my guns away and walk around Whitespring until someone gets a clue
---
If you're on PC I have a Melee bro who would love to buy the cloaking one off you
---
A handful of screws is going to be worth more than a hundred bottle caps. Caps make a good currency for all the same reasons as gold, but even then most people carried gemstones instead of bullion for travelling
---
Level caps are bullshit. 
---
Wait till you start getting wood armor only.
---
I'm just saying  what I want my buddies and I want more power armor paint too.
---
Usually there are 8 in the safe, a chance for 1-2 in the trunk, and a chance for 1-2 on the mayor's body.
---
I just walk up to the office avoiding most scorched.  Takes just a few minutes.   
---
And I found one, woo hoo!!!
---
Yea, the credit definitely goes to BioWare and less EA. Although there were a few EA rep replies but the bulk of them are by BW devs. You can really tell that they love the interaction and memes.
---
bump
---
That is something we can agree on, unfortunately I have a feeling they will be focusing alot more on pvp instead of pve based on the upcoming pvp mode. Pvp wouldn't be bad if it was balanced but it just doesnt have a benefit aside from the trophy and the caps but even the caps dont make it enjoyable. I remember a rumor of a pve dungeon style vault mode or something like that, and that sounds like it would be pretty fun.
---
They stealth nerfed this, a few hours ago. Can no longer build at any of the 30 I used to frequent. I'm done with the game 100%.
---
I helped a buddy do the Mayor quest last night and got a ton of stimpaks in the chest. I just thought some player had left them up there. Thanks for this tip!
---
Oh ok
---
Word Brother!
---
yeeeeeeeeeeboooi
---
No disrespect to your post, which I understand. It just seems like whenever new assets *do* go to the Atom Shop we're treated to "but muh microtransactions," "fix the game instead," etc.
---
Not as hard as you think, trading exists and watoga is a place where people often dump one star legendaries. That and in trade weightless marine goes for around 300-500 caps a piece. 
---
I want a video of this thing destroying the ghouls every time someone spawns in.
---
Yeah I'm on PC.
---
What’s your gamer tag? I need people to play with
---
I've seen random items like that lying around with those behaviors.  Wondered what was up with that.
---
This is 100% this - most of the QA credits are under Bethesda Softworks: https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/fallout-76/credits
---
Killed a three star protectron got a drill not even a legendary one. 
---
Aww ok. Back to micromanaging all the junk then 
---
There is possibly two solutions, have you tried to reinstall the game? Another thing is possibly outdated drivers, if you have nvidia you may have to go I to the nvidia control panel and manually update certain drivers.
---
Thats a good tip! I've recorded that as a priority to do item. Thanks!
---
I've been pretty interested in those shrines. Haven't had time to go out looking as of yet - I don't know where any of them are located so it will be a lot of wandering. Fun wandering though, to be sure. I also want to start leaving mothman eggs at them when I find them. I'm not really sure why.
---
I'm trying to run down a 'sunken church in the mire' that's supposed to have mothman and interloper elements together. I found Haven church but didn't find anything like that there (unless I totally missed it). Any ideas what sunken church that might be referencing?
---
How much Ram?
---
Most likely is that you conection to the servers is delayed, it can take some time to your loot to appear since is generated on their end not yours :/
---
&gt;ffgod
---
nice description of Fallout 76 ;)
---
32 on the big one and 16 on the other
---
i am the friend in this post  
---
i have 32 gb@3600mhz of RAM.   
---
he has 16@2400mhz  
---
PC specs are not the issue
---
Honestly compared to all the other games that have been out (especially after 76’a release) have been a whole lot more productive than what you lot has done in the past three months.
---
Get off your ass and get something done. There are no more excuses at this point. 
---
Oddly enough, are you by any chance using a wireless controller on the pc? I use a Bluetooth controller and it has a really odd tendency to slow the computer when the controller starts losing signal. I’m not really sure why that’s the case but it happens 
---
That's it, I'm putting up a sign saying "FAWLTY TOWERS" just to see what happens.

I love how even they don't mention fallout 76 as something to be proud hahaha
---
Ultra-light shit breaks too fast.  No one has that much ballistic fiber.
---
"*Our devs are aware of Fallout 76 and will try to play it some day*"
---
Buy a stimpack plan, use the pharma farma perk and collect any and all stimpacks and blood packs, don’t get your ass beat too much.
---
Thee streets shall flow with the blood of the non-believers!  - Beavis
---
Yeah, buggy has always been a thing, this is broken.
---
I like the idea of random kindness in game bleeding over to the IRL player who may have needed that little boost if they were having a non-awesome day.
---
Probably means a February surprise DLC drop...with needed bug fixes and even more in-game financial inflation
---
As of there was a freaking way to know what I've read, heard, played etc. You don't even know if you have, and you may never know.
---
I'm on PC I'll check those when I get on in the morning. Thanks
---
Where can one reliably find said item and mods? Additionally, is it considered 2h melee?
---
I love having to pay more to have the possibility of more atom options!
---
This is my girlfriends biggest complaint. 
---
Amongst other things like having the materials she needs to repair her gear even though the game says she doesn’t, forever loot spinner, corpses disappearing, enemies regaining full health, server disconnects, not being able to fast travel to CAMPs, and more.
---
I always have to try to justify to her why we should keep playing through all the issues. It could be so good if they fixed these QoL issues.
---
I was very skeptical and waited a month before buying, but it has greatly exceeded my expectations: it is my fav fallout.
---
could be sneaky references to elder scrolls and the daedric princes, tho thats mostly speculation in my part since several look dwemer and others look daedric
---
Bloodied Melee for the win... my bloodied death claw gauntlet does 460 at full health with my strength buffs  (21). Add unyielding armor  and I can do 2000 per hit
---
Remember they said they’d be more open and talk more? I’ve done this. I went through this with Bungie. They’re doing the exact same thing Bungie did with their community. I’m not doing this again 
---
Did you read the plan already?
---
I think the regular default column is  located under Foundations? Maybe check there. 
---
Thank You for what you're doing, fingers crossed they pay attention and sort this stuff out. Kudo's dear sir.
---
But you see, that would be great, because we would create a whole new class of enemy as well as encourage the pVp that Bethesda seems to want. What I would do is remove the wanted status from the map - griefers can now hit and run and hide, but the bounty collected from them would be higher. This would lead to players having to actively hunt down them down creating a bounty hunter class of player, or perhaps laying in ambush for them so they can exact their revenge. 
---
i guess perforating has 40% armor piercing  piercing has 20% armor piercing and stinging has 15% armor fiercing.
---
OK so I did some initial testing in Watoga... It doesn't look good. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/xkXDe6i
---
So that is the shown resistances when having an non AA and AA laser gun equipped. The AA lowers the ballistic resistance, but not the energy resistance of the robot.
---
I did some killing with a basic gatling laser and the AA one. Time to kill seems identical. Hard to say since I might be a bullet or two off due to the accuracy of the gun, but I could not tell any difference myself and with a supposed 50% resistance reduction I think I should be able to tell at least a little.
---
Tomorrow I will do a few other different types of enemies to see if I get the same results. (in case these robots were special for some reason)
---
I miss some of the prefixes that at missing from previous fallout titles. Like Plasma Infused and Flaming on ballistic weapons wouldn't even on the same tier as Anti Armor, but the variety would be nice. Freezing was over powered when used with Overdrive in FO4, but a tweak here and there could make defensive players that get stuck with Medic's and Suppressor's get a slow effect too, a lack of crowd control not even on par with crippling perks. Wounding would have broken this game day one, but a change in its mechanics to refresh a stack with a max stack limit like Flaming would add a much needed edge to the bullet sponge problems people are having.
---
There's already a massive db tracking all the various baby stashes in each world. What's a few more at each players camp?
---
Was mostly rhetorical ;)  
---
Posted under "Power Armor" for now, I'd guess it's related to the race and perk changes that occur when entering and exiting PA.
---
Unless you're using some low level pistols, enemies should die pretty easily if not within an adequate number of hits. Whatever you're doing is just wrong.
---
Shoot til he's on the ground, then bash the hell out of him with a bladed melee.
---
I've yet to see any game developer behave in any other way. Save maybe very small indie developers working on a very small game.
---
I have been hours trying, and I have noticed something. Dam, facing the spawn place. There is a truck on the left side, with a Stop sign. It is a road.
---
Take it. It goes by the lake to a factory.
---
There is a truck with glowing fungus. Keep going.
---
Next there are two trucks. In between them there is another trick-o-trade spawn place. It was a male this time, but with no plans. 
---
I have noticed the same things that spawn at "65" spawn there: tomb, tank, lone traveler... (btw it once had a gauss rifle in his bag)
---
Also, a Mothman spawns there and I was able to kill him, twice.
---
I might try again tomorrow for the plans, and keep you informed
---
Is this someone that actually like The Last Jedi as I do?
---
Server hopping... server hopping never changes
---
* Bugs - Graphics  
---
\- Some graphic elements are / turn invisible or glitchy (rapidly appearing &amp; disappearing), most common place is southern buildings of Watoga  
---
\- Some enemies (reported on dogs and wolves so far) appears with an extremely stretched and glitchy body making it impossible to kill unless using a crit in V.A.T.S (or being lucky with some kind of explosives)  
---
* UI - Display  
---
\- V.A.T.S not working properly for energy weapons and legendary 2 shots weapons (displaying 95% hit chance while actually hitting 1 time out of 4); same issue was happening in Fallout 4 with "low speed projectile weapons" such as plasma rifle, so it is probably related to the mechanics of the V.A.T.S itself unable to properly works in real time.  
---
\- Entering the pip-boy right after logging makes you unable to do anything but relog
---
I *would* buy the beds. But they’re child size, so....no thanks, Bethesda.
---
Even the four post bed is ridiculously tiny.
---
Would like to see energy weapons becoming more capable end game weapons. If I could roleplay as a gunner that’d be boss
---
Doing what I can, and thanks!
---
I ended up finally getting the plans on a witch right at the 65 spawn. Also got the skeleton plans there trying for the witch. 
---
Yeah its two handed, found the mods at the watoga vendors, and the chainsaw has a few spawn points. Theres a good video on youtube for location. Just need some lumberjack gear lol
---
San andreas has stayed in the top 20 pirated list since it came out.     15 year old game.   
---
gtav was ok.  but it's a far miss from their earlier ones.    
---
back when they gave a shit about the pc.
---
The server consistency is interesting, for sure...
---
They’re rare? I sell them whenever  I find them.
---
This is what I envision how bulking plastic with plastic in game works.
---
it's actually extremely depressing, it takes me 5-10 minutes to  kill a scorch beast with a 2 shot explosive handmade, they have way to much health and drop literally nothing of value.
---
What's your system? If PS4 I'll give you a full set minus left arm.
---
thanks, I appreciate the data, once we have it all, sounds like another legendary bug report.
---
Don’t worry guys I have begun the countdown. You shall be divided into atoms glory once more.
---
*Nuclear launch detected* 
---
I have a junkies rifle and i cant ever get addicted to things. Kinda wish it was something useful 
---
Suggestion with regards to trading:
---
Allow players to set desired prices for certain items and these prices auto-populate when opening a trade dialogue with another player. Couple this with not being able to see a player’s entire inventory, only what’s offered for trade. 
---
It's not very massive as far as number of players on each server.
---
The other stuff I can let slide as its all rare for us atleast, its Bethesdas normal M.O. but having an angry wife is unacceptable. And it happens almost every play session
---
So here's the thing - the limit on stash space is one game loop mechanic that keeps the game interesting.  Not saying they shouldn't raise it, but if it's increased too much, the savaging mechanic gets ruined.  The time I spend reviewing my loot, deciding what to keep and what not to keep, is part of the gameplay that I actually really enjoy.  It's a pain, but it's one I look back on fondly.
---
That said, they could fix ONE thing that would make inventory management so much better.  Make the weight sort option take into account the quantity.  I don't care that one .45 ammo weighs .003 or whatever, what I want to know when I sort by weight is that I'm carrying 7 pounds of it!  The UI doesn't currently do that, and it's particular bad in your stash.
---
I'll bet the average person has 30 pounds of cloth in their stash and doesn't realize it!
---
Get legendary weapons with good perks. You can check out market subreddits for trading, or farm some on your own. Two shot explosives are still good after their nerf.
---
the toilet bandit!
---
&gt; Bugs - Graphics 
---
Can you give me some better examples or screenshots of the glitches?  
---
The creature portion will go on the NPC side... 
---
&gt; UI - Display 
---
Lol how could I forget that one... 
---
But UI or "Player" page?
---
Someone did the soft version of this to me and put up a bunch of communism posters in my house.
---
&gt; So, if I wanted to bring down the SPECIAL caps to the amounts for those games, I would subtract 5 from each stat. This would make them equivalent.
---
Not necessarily so. To better represent your hypothetical system in the Fallout 3/NV system, it would be better to use of percent of your hypothetical 76 stats. If you do that, what you'll find (rounding down on all counts) is:
---
STR: 8
---
PER: 4
---
END: 9
---
CHA: 5
---
INT: 9
---
AGL: 7 
---
LUC: 9 
---
These are stats you cannot achieve with just base stats in 3 or NV even with Bobbleheads and Implants. I know there are other ways to get permanent SPECIAL boosts (which still might not be enough) but the point is it's not quite as clear as you make it out to be. 
---
I will say I'm not opposing to raising the level cap, especially when big DLC-equivalent updates come out. I'm not sure if these numbers are best, and they don't translate as well to 3 and NV as you think.
---
I run all the rifle perks, tank killer, and bloody mess all maxed. I also have crit perks and rely heavily on vats. I take down scorchbeasts pretty fast using a lever action. 
---
Other than that, having the right legendary does helps a lot. I have an AAE combat shotgun that just eats things alive with half as many perk cards as my rifle set up. But my lever action is just a 1* Quad, but with gun fu equipped, I completely shut down swarming mobs with chain headshots. 
---
Valentine's Day would be the *perfect* opportunity to sell a heart-shaped bed!
---
Bow chicka wow wow
---
I have to agree, the community is great, however the game is meh after you've finished the story
---
In my experience the quality of the drop depends on the amount of people in the area. For example u can load in and out of WS or uranium fever all day, killing 3* Enemies but if ur the only one there u will not get 3* drops, mostly one star,sometimes 2 two stars. 
---
The have said they intend to raise the limit.
---
Disagree, some of the longest lasting and most profitable MMOs are F2P and that does not necessarily mean content is hidden behind paywalls, it is only if the DEVs choose that path. For example the best way to do this is how fortnite is doing it atm.
---
And if you paid for this game, then WTF were you thinking? This disaster was predicted long b4 release. And expecting people to pay for a not even anywhere close to a half finished game is ridiculous.
---
And since it is going so badly they will be losing money and at some point there will likely be pay to win aspects implemented for them to bleed the cash back, and if that is the case (which is where they would make their money they lost) then it will most certainly become free to play. This "game" does not deserve to be pay to play, and F2P will bring alot more people which will in turn bring more money making opportunities to fund the future of the game for the DEVs instead of trying to rely on a small amount of people to pay a 1 off price for a game that is too last years and years with constant updates patches and new content and with a model like that in a game as bad as this it certainly will not last. Imo this game will crash and burn badly unless it goes free to play. It was a stupid idea to make this game P2P, this was never going to go well.
---
Massive Fallout fan and i seen this comming and after all their bullshit i will never pay to play this game, you had to be 1 dumb shit to actually pay for this, you got scammed. Guess your not really an MMO guy.
---
Mountain side bed and breakfast always has a chainsaw spawn.
---
I think you can only craft them
---
Agree 100%.
---
Thanks 
---
I'm board of these super ledgendary drops from mutents.....
---
I will buy that off of you 😱
---
I don't remember any stash system in Skyrim other than boxes in my house and resto loop carry weight enchants. What stash system are you referring to?
---
VATS and Pipboy reported and logged
---
Screws.  Needs more.  All I can think about is screws.  I have several hundred springs now.  But all I think of is how to get more screws and in doing so I level, then I need more screws to replace the items I built while needing to get more screws.
---
My day is all about farming screws.  I'm like a boxing-day-shopper when I see a globe...
---
What level are you
---
reasonable suggestion, but do you think it might be "heavy" to have the engine record "your" assigned price, vs setting it?  
---
I mean that's a no brainier for player vending.. 
---
17
---
I wish this is what dropped weapons looked like normally
---
Eh, Anthem is coming out and I haven't touched this game in weeks.  
---
🤷‍♂️
---
here
---
Probably not a good idea to post saying you have 32000 radshields... Just saying.
---
This
---
First of all, the real trick is to drop the scorchbeast's health significantly before it can even spot you using sneak attack damage multipliers.
---
During the day, you can get 2.5x damage with Covert Ops, combined with Bloody Mess +15%, +60% Rifleman cards, Tank Killer and all you need is a gun with decent range that fires quickly. For me that's my 2-star Handmade (Two-shot and +25% fire rate, non-automatic, using standard hardened reciever, although a Prime non-automatic reciever is even better but i hate farming for Ultracite 556). If you want to go overkill pop some drugs for another +25%
---
Engage the beast at distance while it's flying around and plink it as fast as you can while hidden for that sweet 2.5x damage (3.5x at night with Mr Sandman!). By the time it is alerted to you and is flying at you it should be at 50% or less health and finishing it just is a simple matter with VATS or manually taking shots at it in the air.
---
Try it with generic non-legendary Handmade, you'll see that its not difficult if you can wear it down with Sneak attacks first. Waiting for it to land isn't always an option.
---
I got guard duty.
---
Maybe try running ram at default speed (non xmp) just a shot in the dark
---
He had 138
---
Thought those didn't drop any more after the last patch? 
---
Ha! I actually logged into the game when I read that there was a pink armor skin in the Atoms store. Was quite disappointed to see it wasn't for PA.
---
I'm also loving my tuxedo, mid century modern chandeliers, snowman, and about a dozen other charming tchotches I've gotten from the Atoms store. 
---
Now if only they would put a modern golf skirt in it or a clean bathing suit. 
---
Your stash should only contain what you need. If you find yourself adding far more than you're taking in you likely have too much.
---
Common culprits in junk are steel, wood, cloth, and lead. All fairly common. 
---
Bulk the excess and sell it. Lead is hard to say limit, as it depends on what ammo you use and how often you find yourself crafting more, but the rest you probably don't need more than 3-500 each. From my experience that's more than enough but maybe late game crafting demands more.
---
Most food items are entirely unnecessary, they're everywhere. Same with water, once you can build a purifier you're probably never short on water. Stimpacks will also vary from person to person but if you find yourself dropping off more than you'll ever use you have too much. I keep ~30 stored.
---
Fusion cores also take up a lot. Throw out everything under 75%. Keep no more than 3-5 stored max.
---
Obviously if you only have 1-2 above 75 maybe keep a couple more. 
---
There's really no reason to go over 600 unless you have shit you don't need. Hoarding is hard  habit to break in a Bethesda game but you have to here.
---
And here, we have an NPC who hasn't actually played the game. 
---
Ah haha just re-read, my bad. Everything is blurry at this hour for me :p
---
Not true - they have a chance to drop plans for Prime Receivers, I've gotten a few this way. Granted it is still a pain to kill them and far better to just avoid them entirely if possible.
---
Don't have anything level 17 but have a couple 1* level 25 ones you can have
---
Should go check out Devil's Backbone. Would make for hell of a Patriot CAMP spot with a sweet as giant flag pole on the hill, nice scenery and convenient water nearby
---
I do want to get a chainsaw as a silly weapon. My Mr buzzy blade is my SBQ killer and White Springs cleaner. I can usually get it up to around 500 damage per tick. I think i maxed it at 1000 a couple times. 
---
Never thought of taking screenshots sorry, it's so random you notice only if you already know the area of if you're hitting an invisible wall.
---
It's happening for a lot of players with vanilla graphic settings so it's not mod / custom.ini related.  
---
As long as I know this bug is the most consistent like a said with the southern building of Watoga (just fast travel in the center then head south, usually at least one bulding vanish and you hit invisible wall while walking) as long as bunkers in the mire.
---
Also, no idea where you should put this \^\_\^
---
Hope you're not doing all of this for nothing, and kuddos for the work mate.  
---
I saw someone farming robots coming out of the tubes at White Spring.  Was that you too?  Dude was just standing there, blasting them as they came out one by one.  I was in the area for an hour or so and he was plugging away at it the entire time.
---
Won't happen I'll gladly buy elder scrolls 6
---
Melee.  I leveled as a sniper and shotgunner, but when I saw the ridiculous damage you could do with 2 star sledge, I changed my build.
---
currently level 121. I have been running around with a stupid 1 star unyielding wood left arm until a buddy finally got a unyielding combat left arm and gave it to me. 
---
This.
---
With the optimized rifle build (40 P,L,A perks) and decent weapons (TS Dragon, TSE Gauss...) you can SOLO lvl 80 scorchbeast in 10 seconds…before they begin to regain HP.
---
With poo weapons and random casual builds, better to avoid them.

Just limit the amount of items that can be auto-populated in that fashion.  Say 25 or 50 unique items that can have a price set to them. It would go hand in hand with player vending once that becomes a thing. 
---
Wot lvl
---
&gt;I'm level 51
---
pffft
---
took me 350 hours to drop my first explosive shotgun. combined with other characters, that's around 700 hours in total. and it was a mutant's, mind you.
---
the abundance of god rolls in the market makes people think rolling them is easy. it's not. they're the result of duping. it's around a 0.000001% chance for a perfect legendary.
---
if it wasn't for duppers few people would have good legendaries. definitely not explosive ones.
---
Lol i have been dropping all my plans at wotoga suitcase. dumping legendaries and only selling stuff nobody wants, been dumping ammo and stimpak at overseers camp but no luck yet.
---
I find it interesting that players are creating mules to carry all the stuff they find rather than selling to others for low prices as they can not take on more caps. I have been at 25000 caps from collecting my 1400 every day but i cant find anything to buy with it. Not a rant just saying. 
---
Mayb puh it in the fron lean ress Sarmage
---
How many companies and spokesman go quiet when the game they release isnt given GOTY accolades, or gets widespread panning - i am looking at you Sean Murray, No Man's Sky?  They couldnt be shut up prior to release and then they go mute.
---
It is almost as if they get all sulky and quiet.
---
Has Todd Howard even gotten out from under his desk yet?
---
I got a lvl 1 troubleshooter’s piece off a legendary eyebot once. 
---
It's over 200 per shot to start. However, with Tenderizer and Adrenaline it will do more damage over time. It takes me about 100 rounds or less to bring down an 80 in the air, or about 25-50 if it is on the ground (about 5-10 seconds). On average I use about 2,000 rounds during Scortched Earth and it still has a bit of durability left.
---
Warframe is free on PS4...
---
All I've gotten so far have been like a low level laser rifle but will keep my eyes peeled 
---
I’m still this game will probably die before any real DLCs would be released. Seems like this project has no real leadership.
---
go home, Todd.
---
ain't no one got room for QoL perks, boy
---
I did this the other day to help a guy with a small bounty and the ass wiped me out, he ran to spawn spot and just as i loaded took me again, i jumped out of server. Im not one for pvp at all
---
Yeah I cant wait for that game!
---
I gathered the strangler bloom and made each of those 138 radshields. Next experiment I up it to 200+, just to see what it takes to get radiation suit results. 
---
Go do the mayor for a day quest like all the other big boys. Then you wont get attacked.

Yeah, I have max lead belly, but I should probably max out Iron Stomach too. It's getting old. 
---
Wow I've never gotten anything lower than lvl 5 thought that was the lowest
---
Ok so most people regardless of level don't them on solo?  I'm just wondering because I usually try and kill everytheing I see but was rediculous trying to dump 200 round into it with my handmade and only took it down 1/8 of it's health.
---
Its an instanced MMO. Many worlds. ;) 
---
Good info, thanks!  
---
I am going to make an "Locations and Environment" page, maybe on that one?  
---
Stalk me to make sure I remember, with the number of issue's I've been reporting I loose track at times!
---
I walked outside the other day and spotted a plastic spoon on the ground, and my first was ooh I need that for shotgun ammo :)
---
Legendaries are based on the level of the enemy that drops them. AFAIK eyebots are only ever lvl 1.  
---
That's alot of effort, I know how hard those are to find. Good job. Be interested to know how you go!
---
This if Fortnite.   
---
They won't. 
---
And thanks, trying to give the community the complete and full accounting of the issues.
---
Ill keep you posted. 
---
Oh, sorry my bad. I thought that part was the actual fact and the song around it was the humour.
---
I think it’s a little more complicated than a single value change 
---
Nope I changed the damage values for all plasma guns in fallout 4 by accident trying to make a mod. Literally changed 1 value.
---
It's literally not.
---
Thanks for the tips.  Will have to get some new cards sounds like.  Most my cards are for weight reduction right now.
---
 If you purchase plans for Heavy, Sturdy or Regular, that's what armor you can build. Generally the mods work across all the weights on any given armor. My BOS mods go on it all. 
---
 A Legendary piece is no different than any other for mods.
---
fairly well known bug , sorry you got hosed by it .
---
There's a post somewhere with the math. It's pretty close to what you already took
---
Skyrim edition PS5 confirmed
---
I feel like Bethesda has no idea how to pull Fallout 76 out of the grave right now.
---
Not sure if this is just me or on xbox, bit assaultrons always have an infinite charge on their laser
---
You know, when we defend Fallout 76, we often talk about how despite all of the bugs and quirks, there are these little moments of brilliance that make it worthwhile.  This is definitely one of them.  Thank you for sharing!
---
Been using for over 100 hours the only piece to break so far has been the legs once because they where low CND versions.  
---
With the right perks and the fact this is best used on stealth players. well those combined mean you will rarely if ever need to repair your armor. 
---
Thank you for your money,I'll be passing it to my banker
---
Yeah me either. But when I go to white springs and see a camp loaded with turrets right next to the golf club I go all out to keep that shit destroyed lol.
---
Thanks for the info
---
So purchased plans don't mean that I can now MOD that armor. Just wanting to now if  I have a 3* combat piece and buy the plan can I now make it a heavy variant like I see posted in the trade subs. Or does it drop a certain way and can't be changed.
---
And lose all rise lvl 50? Not.
---
Doesn’t alter my point in the least btw.
---
I think that he meant that you need to do a lot of research to figure out much the values should be changed. You don't want to make changes that are too big or too small. 
---
Wat?  
---
I mean yeah that's the testing part. Change it kill a few enemy types, kill a player, if it's to op then change and repeat. It wouldn't take that much work just a decent qa team and some effort.
---
Lol definitely not silly i got this thing shredding mobs all over the waste land. Look out queen your next haha. Ill def be picking up the next buzz blade though 
---
My wagon tipped over and I lost everything because I didn't want to pay to take a ferry across 
---
Sanjay and the Grafton mayor really are ear rape.
---
I like the random encounter with two Mr. Handies in a loop.
---
Congratulations! You found the acid!
---
Idk why but whenever I hear the Grafton Mayor I see a face in my head. A really annoying, punchable face.
---
They do, obviously, but the effects of the TS and E have been severely nerfed.
---
Regarding the vats no damage bug, I get it with melee weapons as well. And I counted 6 and 7 shots sometimes with not one making any contact with an enemy. 
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary
---
 You can't change armor type. Heavy, Sturdy and Regular/Light are types of armor. Your Legendary piece will be one of these and that's the it will stay.
---
 You can mod it to hearts content though. The best mod for Combat armor are the BOS mods for Chest, Arms and Legs and you can put them on any Combat Armor. you can also add attributes like Dense and Strengthened for instance.
---
To add the your point of Player Not Versus Player, they need to develop a bad sport lobby as that's one of the lobbies you will find yourself in if you destroy other people's car(s) in GTA V. Destroying a players camp should give you a status of a bad sport, and for you to be forced into a lobby with other bad sports. You get out of that lobby if you cease to continue playing that way(as a griefer).
---
I read in 2 other posts it doesn't affect drops. :( 
---
So you complain about something which has a solution built into the game from day one. The bug, which was apparently fixed, was the vendor bot getting attacked. So you are complaining about s quest that is part of the game. And complaining about a bug being fixed. You are the definition of r/fo76. 
---
Every half brained comment you community managers make feels like someone has a gun to your head and it’s really sickening. 
---
Here’s a pretty little piece of advice: 
---
STOP NERFING THE GAME 
---
RELEASE MORE REAL FIXES FOR THINGS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR SINCE NOVEMBER. 
---
I chose the merchant job but everyone only gives these weird drink tops and so my family starved to death after a few days 
---
“Don’t worry, we will pass this info and your complaints up to the dev team.”
---
Can you buy plans for dense and strengthened or just learn them by scrapping
---
Like screws. Who doesn't like the occasional screw? 
---
Then listen to us and fix this game. We want to love it but you guys are the ones making it hard
---
Bye
---
That is effing amazing. To think, that kid must have been terrified and you hooked him up! What a rollercoaster of emotions for the tyke. 
---
[English Accent]”And who gets to clean up this blood?  That’s right!  Me!”
---
And if Stormbringer wasn’t a jerk by breaking every time I turn around...
---
Lol. Day 1 bug that still hasn’t been patched. 
---
I dunno. This Gatling Laser gives Super Good Advice.
---
It just works
---
Hire a community manager who actually acts as a go between between the Devs and the community at large. They're a billion dollar company, they can make this lappen
---
Considering how hard it is to get an addiction, it’s a pretty useless effect. 
---
That would be awesome. 
---
You can say you wouldn’t hire them again. 
---
same thing just happened to me except i was just stupid and got out of my power armor in a nuke zone to cook....   my bag of shit included ultracite screws and springs...  not a thing we can do about it.  i tried dropping things near it, dying near it...  hitting R instead of E... nothing worked.  its there forever.
---
Start a gofundme!
---
Jokes aside, that would be a kick ass combo. 
---
I mean, 100 million dollar game or 10 million dollar game, it doesn't really matter. You either care enough to actively engage with your playerbase or not.
---
You should! Maybe that’s why it’s acting that way. 
---
#relationshipgoals  #buildingbridges 
---
same thing just happened to me.
---
I know, sadly this curse still haunts me, all the way from Skyrim and fallout 4. Junk takes up hundreds cuz of crafting and the rest is just cosmetics I picked up that’s not in shop and the rest are legendary weapons for an alternative character
---
Yes, agreed! Loving the pink pipboy, but I really wish you could apply that pink paint to all armor!!
---
I lost 748 in one shot!
---
When you just build a chest in your house and store everything there lol
---
This doesn’t make sense as a new player coming out of the vault would need to see those bodies. Also because you’re not rebuilding anything because everyday is reclamation day.
---
Yet there was no update to actually change this.
---
Gatling Lasers are the worst npcs. High maintenance, too flashy, and most of the time always hungry.
---
Happy belated birthday
---
Actually, same exact situation, except not as much ammo, this was my first one too.
---
Man this thing was worth the 70 some dollars.  I have a huge case of buyers remorse.
---
There's a PA station on this mountain. It's a scourged encampment, but should be easy to take care of. There's a video on YouTube that explains where this one and another one are and how to approach them. I went to this one and found 3 pieces in the chassis sitting there. But it's not always going to be the same, obvi. There's also a bunch of stuff to loot up there.
---

---
Was it dead in one hit still? 
---
Problem is hazmat suit and power armor has a hidden radiation percentage reduction. (reduces rad damage taken by 90%) 
---
So unless they make us an underarmor with that percentage reduction. Or make the rad resist legendary percentage based. They could also revamp rad resist perk card to be percentage based and not flat and it wouldnt be as useless.
---
You may be able to learn bu scrapping but the rate of success is very very low. The plans are very rare, I found only Strengthened.. The mods used to be fairly common for BOS but they have disappeared now. You can look in th etrain car west of Watoga Station, they used to spawn there. I once a found Dense mod and its on my level 50 Heavy Combat Armor. That's the ony Dense one I've seen.
---
 You may get some of this stuff from events, they drop stuff like that but as I don't do em' I dunno. ;)
---
Used to be able to buy plans, haven't seen any since the last patch though
---
 You can still find dense mods though, so make sure you check vendors for mods
---
Report that player? 
---
Looks great! You on PC, would love to get a private tour
---
I basically only engage them when there’s a surface to air missile emplacement handy. Those suckers help a lot.
---
See, you need to be able to move the storyline along. WoW learned that. Get Flatwoods partially cleared up, show tha there's been some movement … when you start, there's a mention that you're the last one out. Show that those before you have been churning some butter. No big.
---
Let the game grow and evolve. One year should be enough time for some small changes, and giving the Responders a proper burial? First order of business.
---
Of course. I was more amazed at seeing a legendary eyebot. Don’t come across them very often. 
---
I think we also need to remember that this is not Bethesda Game Studios Maryland, the folks that gave us TES 1-5 and Fallout 3 and 4. I'm not saying that this alternate studio is incompetent, I'm saying that this is their first game on Bethesda's engine. They've made multiplayer games before, sure, but not in this engine. Give them a break. This is a struggling game, but certainly not one that isn't redeemable.
---
You aren’t 50 yet?
---
I have never seen one. Pretty cool actually but sucks at the same time lol
---
Will you ever add NPCs or playable offline?
---
Awww! I love Sanjay's voice. I find it soothing
---
just so you know, if it wasn't for dupers you wouldn't even know what a TSE is. the chance of rolling one with +% damage while aiming is around 0.000001%.
---
but you do you.
---
I miss the days when if games were bad people just didn't play them.
---
Yes. Oh wait were you asking me to do it for you? No
---
It adds insult to injury when it is in Watoga or the cranberry bog (end game, high- level sections of the map),
---
If a player has stacked legendaries, the probability of them being duped is high.  
---
If you’re truly concerned, screenshot the trade menu and report it to Bethesda. This is why the smart dupers use mule characters to store their stacks and the ones selling for real money drop their items into containers in the world without even letting you see their inventory. 
---
a fully stabilized auto pipe barely moves. there's no recoil at all.
---
Even if you ignore the weapon/armor drops, the important drops from the queen are broken; the serum recipes. When you kill the queen there are multiple dice rolls calculated for loot, with the dice roll for more common items landing first (explosive vents for example). The game is supposed to lock out those drops after you learn the plan just like with ultracite receivers, but it hasn't been, meaning the items you only get from the secondary loot rolls like serums are constantly blocked from the loot table by the more common ultracite plans.
---
This means the queen effectively only drops ultracite plans and prime receiver plans, with an extremely extremely low chance of neither dropping, and **then** a serum recipe might drop. 
---
So in this case the two shot trumps the anti armor. The ts killed the super mutant in 2 hits,  sometimes 3 hits leaving them with a tiny amount of hp. When aiming directly at the torso of the same level super mutants. The aa always took 3 hits to kill same target.  So the higher base damage on my ts, ended up being stronger than the as
---
Yeah, after ditching ME:A they really need a hit to get their good name back.
---
Maybe use the handmade and a lever action for sniping. Concentrated fire with the rifleman perks, covert ops all help drastically with sneak damage multipliers. A weapon with the zealot's legendary perk helps too. If you're having too much trouble at first, lure the beast to somewhere other things can attack as well, like somewhere with the surface to air missile turrets or the robots at the whitespring or watoga.
---
Did you pick up the weapon, equip it and then unequip or restart the game? That’s pretty much what I did. I had equipped it and decided not to fire it, when I reloaded the game later and equipped it all my rounds were loaded and I didn’t understand how the weapon really worked and I blew my entire supply. Hardly matters, I’m a ballistic man myself.
---
if I had to guess I'd say you're not exactly into minmaxing. you do you, but I'd suggest you to drop ranged weapon altogether. I mean, you're in excavator AND have weight-reduction perks? something's not right here.
---
it seems you'd feel more at home with melee weapons. coupled with the fact you'd probably be able to take on bigger game easily, they weight less, you don't need to worry about ammo, etc.
---

---
Sadly, who has the capacity to deal with dupers is the company that produced this game, but they don't do a lot.
---
You can find in eBay dozens of miserable bastards blatantly selling all the god tier weapons, and they've been running the business for 3 months so far and they are still there
---
Apparently no one in the company cares...
---
Understandable, I guess they will have bigger problems in hands...
---
The drill is bad ass repaired with weapon artisan as well. 
---
Have a friend who was refunded once. He said the response to his ticket was that he could only do it once, but they would let him keep the item he accidentally bought. 
---
Couldn't they just put it in the game as a normal item and not a MTX?
---
 I not only got somthing I immediately forgot, but as well a point for the Officer ques,t on offing one deep in the Glass Caverns. Scared the fuck out of me when the voice went off. ;)
---
Classified as two handed melee weapon in the guide book
---
I mean, I just picked it up off the ground, equipped it, then when I reloaded it was all gone. I too aswell prefer melee, but my Super Sledge had broke and luck of the draw decided not to be friendly.
---
Is only a two handed melee. Does not have secondary weapon type
---
This was my pleasure. And by that I mean, I wish you all could enjoy one hour or so or pleasure the way I did today playing fo76!
---
Just goes to show how unprepared they were for making a multiplayer game, let alone one with built-in microtransactions. The poor CS reps can't even do half the things they should be able to do because the game isn't built for it. Like all the stories of people losing perk opportunities because the game glitched out and the rep is like "I can't do anything about it."
---
Why was it so important to have the item removed from your account? 
---
Once again. Not true. I stayed away from this page for awhile and played since beta. They are not impossibly rare. I've had 6 and none were bought. I'm not arguing the point maybe its just good rng. That is a made up statistic. 
---
3-7k each assuming level 50
---
Depending on the seller
---
Taken? As in how? Did she drop them, and swap-trade, or?
---
Assuming P6 comes out next Tue as planned then the Survival Beta and Vaults opening would be Mar 5th
---
Wish I knew this sooner. Accidentally bought that stupid Christmas emote pack for 1200 while trying to see if they were actually different emotes. For anyone wonderung, they aren't. Same emotes as the normal ones, just a different picture over your characters head. Biggest waste of (free) currency ever 
---
Don't believe they are impossibly rare. Yes the one you got was most likely duped. It's your call to keep it. If you are on Xbox 1 I will give you an authentic Tse. Non duped. 
---
Chaotic neutral.
---
False.  They -do- have experience running games like SWTOR and SWG.  
---
Is the game free yet?
---
Best one, with no question, has to be
---
_soothing voice_

I saw this reported on the forums when that pack was up. Lame.

learn how to use google..
---
you still having fun? and what level are you?
---
It was in a trade 2 of hers for 1 of theirs and it was someone she considered a friend makes it more messed up so I'm trying to buy them and give them to her
---
*Attaches hidden mic to Radioactive _Ranger* Now get the seller on mic saying they are dupes
---
I would maybe pass it as just luck for having 2 of them, but this guy had at least 4 which is absolutely low odds. Even if you are level 141 like this guy was.
---
LOL we are the test servers, people just need to realize this is not AAA despite what they say.  
---
The armor count seems really high. How are you getting 102? Everything drops in multiples of 5 (limbs + chest), and I believe sturdy/heavy is considered a hidden mod instead of a separate item. At least, that's implied by the way weightless treats it, but that could just be yet another bug in the game
---
The Atomic Shop only shows "Owned" after you purchase, so you can no longer see the price and you can no longer see when the item goes on sale. I run a Twitter account where I update folks on new items and sales, so if the item stays in my account, I can no longer track that item. Not a big deal really, but just one of 1 million annoyances in this game that they need to fix if this game is ever going to get on its feet and get out of honestly being in an Alpha state. So I'm trying to publicize the issue. (I've never bought anything in the shop. Not really interested in the items... yet.)
---
This wasn’t the smartest duper given that he was using a level 140 character.
---
Not so exagerated, but there is something of true in that, yes.
---
Anyway, in a multiplayer game, all we dupe or none of us dupe.
---
Why some users should have infi god stuff and rest no? 
---
The duper scumbags were just lucky with the company running this game being lost, and uncapable to control the game they've created...
---
A guy here on reddit gave me a TSE sniper among other things but I felt too guilty to use it so far. 
---
with this said i think it might be best for me to get rid of my extra 40 carry wait perk for the luck crits
---
I saw one stupid enough to open the trade dialogue with me while having 50k handmades. Some aren’t very smart. 
---
I have seen the AAE Handmade for 5 to 6k
---
So, my level 130ish guy. 16 strength naked, step in excavator armor, still 16 strength. No bonus listed in effects tab of pipboy. My level 10 guy, 1 strength naked, step in power armor frame, 11 strength, effects tab lists "power armor: str +10."
---
So you probably saw a str+2 bonus, because you had 9 strength at the time.
---
you've had 6 god rolls? with all 3 mods you wanted? because I find that hard to believe unless you bought them.
---
regardless, it's just math. even without knowing the exact numbers, we can calculate based on %:
---
is mob legendary? is it 3\* (which is a lot lower than 0.33)? did it drop a legendary? is it a weapon (armor is roughly 3 times more common)? is it the right weapon (this is where things get hairy)? is the 1st mod what you want (1/23)? 2nd mod (1/7)? 3rd (1/9)?
---
I constantly run into three star legendaries I cant kill and no one helps when I message. Wish I would drop in servers with people like you more often.
---
Yeah thats why I’m going to throw my duped shotgun away. It just feels too scummy. I still use my bloodied explosive handmade rifle but I earned it myself. So I don’t feel like I’m cheating.
---
I'm dying. Lol'ed so hard
---
No it does not only refer to cards, it is an additional 5 percent stronger for every level of strength
---
I could see myself playing the shit out of RDO if it was just an online cowboy simulator with friends. 
---
Throw peaceful servers out there, fix the fucking progression system to be even slightly realistic and allow me to do more things as a cowboy and I'd play it every night. 
---
As of the last time I played I got chased around for 20 minutes by a shirtless cowboy who tackled me and stabbed me to death multiple times until I quit the game. 
---
I tried to kill him once and then the game called me a bad guy. Fuck that. 
---
A copy of what?
---
Found the bootlicker, we have the legal right to complain about  a broken product, a dev team who barley responds as is, and no updates on a roadmap of any kind. 
---
Put on your cookie monster/Strong/Grahm voice and...
---
SHOOTY THINGS!  
---
POINTY THINGS!
---
...  
---
AAAALLLLL THE THINGS!
---
Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was *Fallout: Grind for Loot*. You must have been a naughty boy if RNG Santa left nothing in your stocking.
---
Why bother! That's my fucking point! Go exploring, do a few dailies, don't just wait for a SBQ or run the Whitesprings gauntlet endlessly unless you enjoy it.
---
If FO76 is pissing you off, then turn it off. And don't beak off about it like you deserve something more. Sixty bucks is fucking chump change. 
---
took me 700 hours to drop a mutant's explosive combat shotgun, so yeah, he was duping.
---
Min lv of lever is 25
---
Haha, literally playing now. Yeah, I still enjoy it!
---
In general we could also use a better armor system, or just have the setup Fallout New Vegas did where most high rate of fire weapons had innate armor piercing through their ammo so that they weren't as impacted by the system.
---
But yeah if we stay in the current system the easiest solution is to dump enemy armor and increase their health to keep similar time to kill for the weapons we already have and ramp up the power of high dps low damage per shot weapons.
---
Bethesda still needs to buff most auto weapons tho like holy shit.
---
I was wondering that too
---
Well I mean it’s all rng, I got a bloodied explosive handmade when I was level 30. But you are correct, it’s pretty much confirmed that he was duping.
---
What's wrong with wanting F76 to improve? You call it bitching. I call it constructive criticism 
---
I agree to a degree, but it's annoying when vendors only pay 20% of value on legendaries and it's hard to sell them. Personally I'm fond of waiting for a player vendor bot, so holding things until then would be good. 
---
That said, forcing myself to bulk junk, and sell excess weapons is good. It's just a pain when you want to dump your junk to go fight without worrying about losing it when dying only to have to spend 10 minutes managing inventory by which point the event or bounty is over or gone. 
---
Hopefully there's a middle ground. I feel sorry for the Devs because no matter what they do, somebody will be angry
---
They can't do private servers with mods... like you said, that renders the Atom Shop useless.
---
Why buy a new bed when somebody can go model it and then mod it into the private servers.
---
The game would shutdown in no time.
---
generally me and my friends seem to get better frames at high and ultra settings. Similar specs.
---
Awesome ty so hopefully if I grind and get 10-15k I should be able to get them for her if I can find them for sale
---
it should be removed along with nocturnal.
---
They have our money, why would they care? If they did care at all, they wouldn't have released a game as jacked up as this.
---
&gt;Not so exagerated, but there is something of true in that, yes.
---
on release me and other users did the math and got to the same result. maybe I added an extra 0 but that's pretty much it.
---
&gt;Anyway, in a multiplayer game, all we dupe or none of us dupe.
---
that's not a very good rationalization, otherwise I demand timed-exclusive shop items back. not to mention, you could've duped yourself. we all had roughly 2 months to do so.
---
&gt;Why some users should have infi god stuff and rest no?
---
that's kinda my point. the odds of dropping the good stuff are so low that, if duping wasn't a thing, someone who rolled a tse would dominate whatever server they were on.
---
I don’t think you understand the meaning of “entitled” here. 
---
It’s the people who paid and played who are best placed to bitch about the state of this game, don’t you think? 
---
Months after release, who else is gonna come to this subreddit to bring up the issues that need to change?
---
What do you think the point of social media is?
---
Are you as stupid as you sound?
---
My favorite is when somebody prefaces their post with "I have over 300 hours in this game.." and then after dozens and dozens of paragraphs about various things that you actually need hundreds of hours to notice makes the tl:dr "game is unplayable".
---
 I kill em' with my Lever Action and a Sword. I'm level 54 now and I hunt Scorchbeasts for sport.
---
I finally did my long intended rad resistance experiment yesterday:   
---
I put on 5 max-level buttressed trapper armor pieces, all with the +25 Rad Resistance legendary effect, (all not-bugged specimens), plus a shielded 9 rad resistance marine underarmor and 1 level of rad resistant perk (I only have 1 END point).   
---
That got me to just over 330 RR.   
---
Stepped into a nuke zone and my radiation intake went from 40's to 16rads.   
---
Taking a diluted rad-x made it 14
---
Taking a rad-x made it 13.   
---
I didn't have bloatfly food, nuka-cola orange or radshield to experiment with.   
---
I also tried using some headwear I had lying around (most notably gas ask and mistress of mystery veil) but that doesn't do anything.   
---
I wish there was some kind of garment that doesn't remove your armor pieces that'd grant the same magic juju perk...  
---
rip
---
It seems like they have more community managers than they do programmers on the project still.
---
I have like 200 farmed weapons (99% crap) in a mule account and not even two of them are stacked. All farmed weapons are unique and every one shows in one single file, even when they have the same modifiers and apparently the same condition.
---
I know indie game developers doing a better job at communicating with their player base then Bethesda is, you don't need to be a multi-million dollar company to give good communication.
---
Yep.
---
If someone puts in that kind of time. Is the game unplayable? 
---
Legit finding 6 tse or aae sounds like Bs to me as well.
---
no offense but the mayority of fallout players is not smart enough to do dungeons or raids. only the 6% of the palyers have scorched earth achievment... when u just need to go there with alvl 1 charater to get it...
---
So if you guys have heard of Dreams on PS4, this made me think how funny it would be if someone made this idea as an actual game in Dreams.
---
Just be a single programmer in an entirely dark room who has two monitors on his desk. One that is just this subreddit where the programmer is browsing all the bug threads and the other where he has to fix every issue. 
---
and as the game keeps going he just keeps getting notification of bug after bug after bug until you eventually lose the game and then he just loses his shit and flips the desk and walks out of the room.
---
According to this sub, yes. Completely and literally unplayable.
---
someones angwyyyy.

*Woah!* It's your **6th Cakeday** 3sips! ^(hug)
---
Also, they're doing this whole weekly themes thing where every week it's a theme with related Atomic Shop items and weekly buff. So that theming idea is likely part of what resulted in a lot of items that many consider to be crap, as well as all of these one-off items rather than more basic things such as clean skins, basic colors for all armors, etc. Pre-planned and scheduled.
---
lol, that is stupid. They played it, yet its unplayable? Fallout 76 players are the dumbest people known to man.
---
Any interest in a database system for compiling all the bugs?
---
149 myself, idk man im bored, never see nukes other than whitesprings anymore, and i sweated alot and got the legendaries and x01 mods early, the only thing i really want is to finish my T51 set so i can sport those christmas lights, whats your goals rn in terms of getting something done? im just tryna find something to do lol
---
Damn, i wasted over 200 hours on something unplayable
---
It's not just you, will be going on the NPC roundup page :)
---
dominate???
---
what world you live?
---
except a few meta-kids (who are mostly leaving) no one is interested in PvP in this game…
---
Have experienced the same issue as well, struggling to figure out if that should fall under UI or "player" page..  
---
   
---
Aka is it VATS and its user interface failing, or something else?
---
OP trying to be a white knight.
---
I wasn't looking for a way to stack many of the same item. Even if possible, it's something I expect they'll fix sooner or later (bobblehead stacking, RadX stacking etc.). 
---
What I was actually hoping for is to see if with 330+ Rad Resistance from gear, I can bring radiation down to ~~6-8rads, then cure my radiation entirely (but not heal - I'm a rad build, I need to be at 19% to be very happy) and as the radiation just creeps in, manage it by aggressively eating radaways while in a nuke-zone. 
---
Rad-X is a non-starter (suppresses x1.5 damage from mutations and marsupial and speed demon), so Dilluted Rad-X has to be it, ergo what I have now is a 14 rads solution. 
---
That's still too hard. 
---
I'll experiment more with the other consumables and with Rad Resistant. 
---
I'm on PS4 look me up for help fukashima_phil
---
I just figured out my problem. I had to set my router firewall to low. 
---
I do this sometimes too. Ill also craft a slightly lower grade weapon to use so i dont one shot low level enemies. Revisiting places with a newbie is fun times. 
---
You’d be better served to just boost luck with unyielding... but no sorry. Mods and luck do not go hand in hand.
---
Maybe?  
---
One person was talking about a GitHub page, but he never got back with me.  
---
By database do you mean something tangible and high end (oracle) or an excel spreadsheet? (Don't take offense, database seems to be one of those fluid terms).  
---
Bethesda/Zenimax is using Oracle for their bug submissions and tracking, but of course don't have access to their systems... 
---
hey, I agree with you. I think the nerf was stupid to begin with. but everyone would bitch and moan about TSEs being unfair and ruining the game, even for those who didn't partake in pvp.
---
so I'm just using it as an argument. I don't necessarily agree with it.
---
This game gives me gas.
---
Shame things you love kill you slowly.
---
My rad worms won't have someone to to tell Alexa to play music.
---
I haven't been able to find the corpse, can you direct me to where it is?
---
It's interesting to me since Anthem (and i'm sure other games in this genre) have released at least a general outline roadmap much earlier in their game's lifecycles.
---
Anthem released theirs a week or so ago (2-3 weeks prior to launch). It obviously wasn't completed detailed but it gave an outline of the acts and the breakdown of their plans. It at least showed the number one important thing about a GaaS product. 
---
Bioware has a PLAN. I truly don't think Bethesda Austin had a post live plan except "let's make a vault a dungeon and see how that goes".
---
I think they ment. 10 lever actions so he can scrap them
---
You run a twitter account to update people on sales, now here you are trying to share a method for pseudo-steal from Bethesda?
---
It's a scam bruh
---
I have the same build and went trapper for highest rad resistance still ended at 14 rads per sec all armor was modded lead and had rad resist 4  perk and ghoulish still the same. Before they patched rad x dilluted stacking it would still not go down from 14 rads per sec no matter how high your rad resist was got. So its annoying that it seems like such a dumb stat when flat numbers and only really reliable as a % resistance. 
---
I wrote words not recorded audio. Are you illiterate else where as much as you are on Reddit?  And yes,  this sub is grounds for expressing  bugs and game improvements but fuck. “I’m level 276 and this game is terrible. What is Bethesda thinking”  This is the shit I’m talking about. 
---
Also tons of a abraxo at white springs in the laundry room 
---
Excellent, you just levelled up.   
---
Next step is to uninstall the game and let everyone on Reddit know.   
---
At least 4 times a week. 
---
What's a scam that I'm trying to hook her up without her knowing???? 
---
the Fallout fanbase is comprised 99% of solo players. the idea of coop should have not gone past an addon for Fo4, let alone pvp. either you already have friends who want to team up or you'll seldom find players nuking the queen and welcoming silent help.
---
I mean, I never wanted to invite a steam friend to see my underground lair with a harem chained to the walls, courtesy of the nexus. but that's just me.
---
triggered.
---
Imma chick so white damsel
---
Ok, i will do that now. I will now waste my time to spread hate
---
I needed the pink pip-boy, don't know what ur talking about.
---
Absolutely do that
---
Haha
---
 There is a perk for a 20% Health Stim Pack. The first one with BOS instead of Polymer.
---
I like teaming up. Don't do it too often. I like to follow low levels and just step in if it looks like they're overwhelmed. What system? If Xbox I'll play with you tomorrow.
---
That ain’t no friend. That’s an o’Driscoll 
---
They're 4 months into players being hands on to this game and they can't even talk about their big roadmap for the game. 
---
Compare that to other GaaS who have pretty much laid out their post launch roadmap plans PRIOR to their game's launch.
---
In PvE God Legendares are just overkill.
---
Of course, those who like to max things (like me) and to feel OP, even in casual SOLO games, will want to have the best stuff, one way or another…
---
I will be very happy if one day they reset all legendaries (duped or not) and we all start from zero, once the dupping cancer was solved.
---
Definitely a YMMV type of thing. I entered around that same level and it was full of level 60+ scorched (must’ve been a higher level player previously). I noped right outta there
---
I like game.
---
You can sell for 25% of an items value with enough charisma, but ya it is so annoying that it caps at such a low percentage and the vendors have so little caps
---
C'mon. Seriously.  
---
Constructive criticism is a strawman.
---
Nobody has a problem with constructive criticism. It's welcome. 
---
Treating people like garbage and treating everyone on a subreddit like a toilet, with toxic cynicism and hate, and then justifying bad behavior with the monetary equivalent of two and a half pizzas that you paid for the game, is what the op was talking about.   
---
Hiding toxic actors behind good feedback actors won't work. They are not the same, and we can still see the bad ones.
---
I've experienced it outside of vats. It almost feels weapon related in my case. 
---
Happens sometimes with a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
I have a two shot hunters rifle that NEVER makes contact. Takes me a good 6 or 7 shots almost every time. 
---
I have a two shot combat rifle that it happens once in a while with. Let's say 30 to 40 percent of the time.
---
And an instigating handmade that I dont think it has ever happened with. 
---
I have not scientifically tested this. I can try if it would help you. I do know it is not relative to the weapons accuracy. 
---
Yeah, New Vegas had a damage multiplier reducing the damage of each shot, that also came with a penetration value lowering the amount of enemy armor in the damage calculation.
---
In FO4 and 76 I'm pretty sure it just reduces enemy armor and doesn't affect the bullets initial damage.
---
I shot the wandering mutant vendor the first time I saw him, good thing he doesn't take damage. Lol
---
Point taken. The point of posting items that are on sale is to benefit players who might be interested in the items. The point of posting this here is not to encourage the method, but to expose it, to try to get Bethesda to wake up and smell the canned coffee. They seem blind to their own forums, so I thought I'd try posting here instead.
---
yeah that would be cool I created a new character tho my experience last night made me rage I died and had my junk paper bag get stuck in a soot bush and end up unable to be picked up.
---
I can for caps!
---
It's currently bugged. Hold onto it until it's fixed.
---
I don't have the Quest yet. I had 8 or 9 collected in my inventory the last time I looked.
---
Not sure if this is what's happening, but oftentimes in large fights like SBQ, in addition to loot lag, things like kill XP, event completion animation/rewards, and legendary item loot popups get delayed as well. For at least a few minutes after the fighting has stopped, the kill XP is still rolling in, and eventually I get the Scorched Earth complete announcement.
---
When i pre-ordered this game (yes i know, NEVER pre-order) i was hopeful of multiple playthroughs, different builds and clocking up 700-800 hrs, the same as FO4.   
---
Unfortunately no.   
---
It's been awhile since i last played, maybe 3-4 weeks. I made it to lvl 60 and finished there. Bored.    
---
I invited friends to buy it, they came and went. It was fun for a while.  
---
I'm definitely not angry with what they gave us, just disappointed. So I pop in here to every now and again looking for some good news. Still hoping.
---
You can do it Bethesda!
---
When you pray for rain,you got to deal with the mud (that comes with it)
---
I wouldn't mind it coming out of the camp budget. Even if it's only two or three gun racks and a single armor mannequin, it would make my camp look so much better.
---
This makes far too much sense not to be true. Pretty sad though. 
---
Did they melee one shot you? Odds are they were bloodied/assassin build with stacked melee bobbleheads. Bethesda only said they fixed the explosive stacking in their patch notes, not the melee one
---
To me your title and post suggests otherwise. Also Bethesda has feedback channels for players to report issues. Or you could report to whomever refunded yo
---
Yeah it was melee lol I think it was a board or something but I can’t stand that lol
---
You are fucked in the head.
---
Skill should always have a chance to trump level. Otherwise whoever plays more always wins, and that's boring for everybody.
---
I thought he same thing.  Where’s the shit going?   Are we accidentally dropping them?
---
Lol I got my lvl in under a month 
---
Ah that's interesting that Bethesda uses Oracle, I didn't know that and I don't know much about Oracle.
---
My experience is in simple PHP-based database websites.
---
Something simple and completely searchable, with all the fields you'd want such as Title, Description, Category, Severity, Platform, etc.
---
Lol, yeah. Imagine someone with a 1x4 walking up and braining you. Been there, not a lvl 37, but still lower level than I am and I was in pacifist.
---
Well if you're using Unyeilding... That's great for one shoting things, but it's practical draw back if you can get one shotted pretty easily yourself. That is assuming you're full of radiation to get the Unyeilding perks.
---
Here's a bit of advice:   
---
Stop thinking about the weapon. There is no magic weapon that'll make you strong. There are many weapons that will make many kinds of builds strong.   
---
You need to start thinking about the build.   
---
Sure, you start with some class of weapons, but then you ask "how can I make those stronger?"   
---
And depending on the rabbithole you chose, you'll find you need to put weapon perks in the right places, enemy-DR-stripdown perks in others, if it's melee you'll want to pump your strength. 
---
Then you'll realize that depending on your particualr direction, there may be specific armor mods, or specific legendary effects, or mutations, or chems or whatever that synergise with is.   
---
Here's a good, flexible yardstick baseline for a higher level high damage build: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acb6uw/proposed\_yardstick\_damage\_build\_not\_weapon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acb6uw/proposed_yardstick_damage_build_not_weapon/)
---
Good luck :)  
---
SOLD!  (Well kind of!). Thanks again r/julianhuncho
---
Yeah I was running low hp 
---
That says way more about time played than skill.
---
Reddit killed this game just like they did to battlefront2.  All that negative release press=an immediately abandoned game.  If it isn't fortnite successful they don't have time for it and have to move on. 
---
Thank you! Yes this game has flaws. A lot to be exact. ;) but goddamn! I lost a fucking X0-1 jet pack mod because of this prematurely released game but I still put in well over 100 hours. They make great games that have always been riddled with bugs. I will always play them with the hopes they evolve. 
---
You should try to sell 500 of them in the market. 500 is enough to keep yourself going for a long while, and somebody would probably pay a pretty cap for them.
---
These are truths.
---
That's some good acid. 
---
The only problem I have had is with high lvl players taking advantage of the low lvl players and robbing them. You are right. This lvl difference needs fixed. Allowing higher lvl players to do this will kill the game. Give pvp its own server. I had a high lvl player actually jump into my fire just so I would damage him. Then he killed me and took my junk bag. Something wrong with that.
---
Exactly first commenters thoughts.
---
Most of the fallout community played silk alot of these years so it's new to alot of people and they get anxious and nervous it's totally understandable they don't talk.
---
The community here is amazing 99% of people that post and comment here are keen to share info and help others, helping bgs fix the game by giving feedback weather or not it's seen or heard isn't the point.
---
The point is to at least acknowledge what's wrong and hopefully it gets fixed.
---
Sorry this went on a bit longer than expected I just want people to stop thinking we're all here to just bitch it's just not true we are here to help 😊. 
---
Make sure you interact with the fallout76 online community at least daily, telling them each day how you no longer interact with anything related to fallout 76.
---
Its an online rpg. You are supposed to have flaws.
---
If you want ask for differents bonus once you reach 50 like more powerful perks or whatever but no SPECIAL please.
---
I've been thinking about it but I already have 21,000 caps so I don't really need the caps. Maybe trading someone for a weapon or something
---
It’s funny that no one on here ever spots the intended reason this game is the train wreck that it is -and before I start getting all the A -holes saying that I’m trolling this game and I’m a hater , I’ve played from day one , paid 79.99 for this crap and continue to play as of 20 minutes ago when I raged quit because I got disconnected during a scorch queen raid and dropped into another server waisting hours of annoying ,loot and ammo grinding and losing valuable crafting supplies  to boot!! This game was obviously Bethesda’s Fortnite -from the get go!!! It’s entire structure , economy and reward system mimics that strategy and game mechanic and if you can’t see that you my friends are blind!! From Todd Coward setting everyone up with the fake hype to charging full price for this mess when it obviously had the makings and architecture of free to play !!! All its assets are fallout 4 and Skyrim and they probably had this intended all along being that Bethesda fans are so tolerant of the “quirky bugs”  that even Todd mocked fans by stating the obvious that the game would have legendary horrible bugs at the beginning and guess what ? That was totally transparent and factual !! But the audience all laughed at his self deprecating humor, the joke was on all of us because he pulled a hype con on every one that lives and loves fallout ; including me . He got us all to pay full pop  for a free to play unfinished mess that was rushed out early to jump on all that Fortnite cheddar being made! Adding injury to insult not one apology or admission of wrong doing from the game studio!!! NOT A SINGLE ONE!!!! I’ve stated this several times in other posts that any normal , reputable company would not have released this game knowing that it’s fan base would be so incensed let alone let the game stand this long with the bugs it still has!! The  game is no longer about survival but about loot management , skirting around bugged game mechanics and not getting jacked by other players.

What about weapon balance and energy weapon fixes? I think that's more important than the Feed the people hopper...
---
People would complain that there are more important things to fix then something that nobody complained about.
---
Yeah I don’t  like to kill the lower lvls I will run over to higher lvls 
---
Each their own.
---
Maybe you should hire an attorney and get a refund. 
---
At least we know now it doesn’t lower your STR to 11.
---
Also I checked too.  Must be I saw the +2 at a lower level cause I was at 9.   But then I kept seeing it later cause I put motion assist servos on my PA and forgot about it.
---
But now I switched to X01 with a jet pack.  Still trying to find Calibrated Shock mods for my new X01 legs.  
---
Like can we just get the gear the companions use in Fallout 4? The game from five years ago? Cait's Corset? Piper's Trench?
---
From multiple years ago you're going to charge us money for? Can we get them now you slimy, scheming bastards?
---
Any data helps, either me to pull the threads or to pass up to the Dev's to tease apart.  
---
    
---
Half of the point of this is to codify the issues and get to the nuts and bolts.  
---
So yes, I'd love it if you did some playing with things in game and see if it never happens with X, but does with Y, and always with Z!
---
Also be as much of a dick to the community managers as possible whenever they post here. Can't forget to do that!

I do team on occasion. But with friends I have played with for 25 years. And we comm.

Imagine being this mad about a few robots.

Game isn’t even worth a dime

So much this.  
---
Unless they’ve changed it in the last two weeks, the damage of the chainsaw is not effected by any weapon perks. Bloody mess &amp; adrenaline work, but that’s about it besides using weapon artisan to “sharpen” it. 
---
To be fair, they went quiet after this community went into a rage with the infamous Bobby Pin update. Some people felt entitled to say just about anything, because they paid $x for their copy. I wouldn't even treat waiters that way if they bungled an order. 
---
Needles to say, the developers that were regularly engaging the community was called out for promising what they didn't deliver. They were probably told not to engage anymore. 
---
Melee is op even without bobbleheads....my lv 20 can one to 2 hit anything in whitesprings max lv.
---
Yeah what melee u running 
---
No hand :)
---
Setting up a database could be fantastic, but work vs reward what major benefit do you see?

Just curious workflow wise how you think it could improve things, outside the ability to search (can't debate the bonus there).

PipBoy Inventory: Throwing knives don't always stack in your inventory when you pick them up. Trying to to drop some of the single knives will cause them to empty out the big stack first before you can drop a single one. Putting a single knife into a container and then taking it back out will put it back into the big stack.
---
One of my smaller stacks of them when I actually remembered to grab an image.
---
https://imgur.com/YynLga2
---
I think it's mostly the ones I pick up in the world instead of the ones I pick out of enemy loot boxes..
---
Same. The universe who is familiar with Bethesda don't take this kind of anneutism over their bugs. They always were buggy, and it gets better over the product lifecycle. 
---
They made their billions despite buggy. 
---
What you see a lot of is people coming from the Call-of-Duty-and-Battlefield-Sphere, where these two franchises compete primarily on polish and bling. And that's what the people coming from there come here expecting. 
---
A game that just doesn't bother aiming for these levels of polish and bling somehow makes their entire understanding of the universe to collapse. 
---
Will be insane when I get lv and use a legendary powerfist
---
u/BesthesdaGameStudios what makes us feel unheard is this fixes that you're making are these tiny things that aren't really game changing updates. What we need is a weapon and enemy rebalance. I know I'm not the only one who stopped playing because the weapons feel like shooting a BB Gun at a rock to make gravel. 
---
Lol
---
It’s randomized from a small set for each player that tagged the mob. this explains why the mob might be using one gun and when you open the inventory you see another 
---
Scrapping armor will not give mods. You have to find or buy them. I hear some events will reward a mod. 
---
I have not,  i will try this as well.
---
"To name a few." I really hope there is a whole list you're not showing because with the amount of bugs that have been posted and the time it's taken, that is kinda sad. This is why people are annoyed, they spend all that time finding the bugs and posting them, doing your job for you. Then you post the next patch which fixes almost none of the bugs that have been posted since launch and change stupid shit no one asked for.
---
Now my problem is finding lots of tick blood.  Any hints on locations? 
---
I’m Doing it with full health...not even risk involved
---
And I’ve been wasting time farming Emergency Services for Stimpacks.  And disappointed 2/3 of the time.  Good to know... thanks.  
---
:o
---
do you know if i unlink my xbox from  bethesda.net will i lose my save game when i relink it
---
Relog at the moon shiners shack over and over
---
Yeah but at low go I manage about 3k damage on both weapons 
---
Farm from the enemies? 
---
So you are selfish. Let those guys cosplay ingame, not everyone have face to cosplay in real life.
---
Now seriously, i spend oved 6k on atom shop, now i am thinking if i need that kill love laught sign, if it was 3separate words i already bought it, but because it is one piece that cant be separated, i am just thinking if i am spending 700atoms on that, yeah i have 3k but, what if something new dope come next week....
---
Which others have it besides Reddit?
---
Didn’t see the overenc icon; couldn’t FT?
---
If I got the ones I wanted I would probably be playing it still. Yes they are not all God rolls and that's why I gave 75% of them away. I kept my Tse gauss, a Tse prime lmg, and a Tse 50cal. Never said they were all God rolls with 3 attachments. You are pulling stuff out of thin air like that percent. I've played since beta. Hbu? 
---
Yep...it’s crazy....without low health op and with low health stronger than the tse where lmao 🤣 suckers
---
uh... file size doesn't equal content. ff15 is around 150g on pc and its a shit game. 
---
LOL You might want to take a step into the real world just once.  These people dont get to choose.  They do what their bosses say, just like you would do at your job.  
---
Yeah I hate pvp, so damn broken, I usually have pacifist mode on, but had some lvl180 idiot come and contest my farm the otherday, only to grief me for my junk, like wtf. Just gave up on the game, seems to be mostly bored idiots playing it now. 
---
Lol my favourite weapon is the quad explosive double barrel 
---
I don’t use xmp. and it’s been running fine for literally everything else for over a year
---
I'll hop on tomorrow evening and try out the various weapons I have and see what I can recreate. Those were my most often used weapons but I have some more stored. Glad to help. Really hope they listen to your hard work and fix this. 
---
In terms of guns I lie the Guass....I like the sound of it winding up hahaha
---
Yeah that things fun to use
---
There's dozens of us. Dozens!
---
Yes, thank you so much!! Again, I appreciate the help and the kindness more than words could say. I'll research the things you've mentioned here (especially the mutations. I know very little about all that) and dive more into other options and see what I can come up with that might go well with my play style and not having me feeling quite so devoted to the setup I'm rocking now. I have the Mistress of Mystery garb, but I've never even worn any of it. That was my favorite quest so far, by the way. :) Thanks again! 
---
Oh no doubt. I don't have any that are the same. Most are only 2 * I have Tse gauss, a Tse prime lmg (no ammo you would have to farm the mats for it) and a Tse 50cal. I stopped playing at lvl 138 I think last month and would be happy to pass them along. I've already given my friends my explosive shotguns as well as a random Tse Gatlin gun. (I regret that the most) 
---
I have a full sniper build with all the perks etc...but my lv20 meleee kills faster than my Guass build lmao 🤣 
---
Hahaha. Nice. I love Last Jedi, imo, its the best in the franchise by far. That throne room scene....My gahd!!!
---
people are picking it up for $10 or less rn
---
I mean not even 6 months from release and it dropped by approx 90%
---
Yeah the melee is better what sniper do you use
---
swg had its time... i played it before they raped it to death with the 'new experience' patch 
---
whats wrong is 3 people that don't talk surround you and try to whale on you with fire axes and then send you a team invite only to not talk some more and end up on opposite sides of the area doing nothing together lol.
---
Do the throwing knives have durability?
---
Somebody already made a text chat mod
---
Look it up on the Nexus!
---
so it's possible....just not in the interest of Bethesda atm
---
Just PVE build Guass riffle and all the perception perks and agility....I don’t use vats cause it doesn’t do anything 
---
Played the first 300 hours exclusively solo, then I met a guy PvPing that tried as hard as I did and didn’t give up.
---
We’d keep seeing each-other and killing each other over several different days until we finally turned on mics to say,”Holy shit, did we just have fun Pvping in this game!?”
---
Been rolling around as a brutal pair of killers ever since. I’m 400+ hours in and just now learning about how charisma allows you to share perks and we’re actually finding people to 2v2 with, even if finding those matches are rare. Never thought I’d be playing PvP in this game nor teaming up, but that’s what I’m doing with a friend I met in game.
---
My advice to you is to actively seek out players and/or communities that enjoy playing the same style that you enjoy. Bethesda has NOT made that easy to in-game so it takes extra effort but I have really enjoyed teaming up (at least in a pair) and it brought new life to the game.
---
You shouldn't, in theory, because the save game / character save data should also be in the cloud, but I'd really suggest not taking my word for it, but getting Bethesda to respond to that one.
---
modders have fixed a majority of problems and given Beth the fix.... Beth ignored / refused it
---
I mean I don’t use vats unless I have that perk that lets you select where on the body 
---
Each player gets different loot. As a team we will pick items and drop what we dont need for the others. 
---
If they're behind the scenes fixing things and releasing patch notes, I don't care if they don't respond to the community directly. 
---
Me or the other guy? You sure do like to throw around bs. Read the comments a little more. Do I need to upload the screen shots or something? I'm pretty sure I have videos of me finding a couple. 200+ hours in and yeah it's not nearly as hard when farming is all you did pre patch at whitesprings, watoga, uranium fever and workshops. I've done none of the main story missions and my armor is a hodgepodge of bs because I litteraly only went for the guns. I also have a faster swing speed mole miner gauntlet, a bloodied (piercing I think) super sledge and golf club, and I have a baseball bat that does the same. Did I dupe for those?? Better yet maybe you should just play my copy of the game and tell me what you think since you apparently know everything about this stuff. 
---
Exactly, you are hunting someone who is hunting someone who is hunting someone who is hunting you. You have big circle on map around your target and thru radio u hear beeping noise if you are looking your target direction, the closer you are, the more frekvent beeping is. (i have tones of perception so i can see my target on compas from faaaaar away)
---
Well... atm usually always misses the target so I rather self aim
---
Well, it *can* still lower your strength. When I first tried it on my 130 guy, my strength went down from 32 to 16, because it unequipped my full set of unyielding armor.
---
Your lips to Bethesda's ears..  
---
Last week the promised to look into streamlining the bug submission process since I was becoming a thorn in their side, little light on communication from them sense that point, but... Well..  
---
And thanks, if nothing else is a new thing to do in game ;)
---
Lvl 138(?) and played since beta. None of them are the same and all of them were random. People like the guy commenting on what I said are the reason I stopped playing this game. 
---
Yeah I kinda rely on vats because I have twisted muscles mutation that gives you -50% gun  accuracy
---
If they're behind the scenes fixing things and releasing patch notes I don't care if they don't respond to the community directly. 
---
Reintroduced in the "Black Tuesday" patch 
---
im just wondering if i unlink it and relink it if that might fix my issue
---
lol its hot garbage, dude. just move on.
---
personally I think that is one of the biggest draw backs right now facing this game you have a bunch of people playing in a server but the server feels empty because none of these people HAVE to interact with you in anyway. I think this would have made more sense if the quests milestones for factions unlocked the ability for you to join teams for that particular faction instead you have to try and communicate with some one to get some thing interesting to happen. I dunno it just feels like player interaction is a chore and forced rather than some thing that should just naturally happen as the game progresses I dunno that might just be me.
---
Welcome to the Bunker Hill. 😂 
---
Did you unlink / log out and uninstall the Bethesda launcher and game on your PC?  
---
And yes, based on the order of events, it's sounds like something worth trying 
---
While I’ve got you here I’ve also noticed that Luck if the Draw doesn’t trigger on that axe either. Not sure if this is known but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to say it. 
---
yea i dont have it on my pc anymore (the launcher)
---
Well, scrapping armor and weapons teaches mod *plans* but the thing is there are limited mods to learn and the rare ones are hard AF to get.
---
The way I understand scrapping stuff is that the game essentially generates a random number from 1-100 each time and you learn the highest req unknown mod your roll exceeded the number of. 
---
Also one player made a list of all the mods for every weapon based on the code so using this as a guide helps a lot as it’s possible that you’ve learned every mod a specific item has to offer.
---
On man, i try to have max 150pieces of every junk. How you handle stash limit?
---
On my bug round up for PA.  
---
[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup - Power Armor - Feb 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amsncf/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_power/)  
---
Still growing them, but it's worth a control-F to quick search to see if an issues been logged
---
I would trade the $80 I spent on Fallout 76 for a remastered NV. I haven't played 76 in a 2 weeks now. I'm hoping to come back to the game when they undo all the nerfs and start fixing the broken shit.
---
Yeah that last "Inside the vault" was a huge letdown. 
---
Nobody cares about those minor scorchbeast fixes at this point.
---
There are hundreds of bugs left from the BETA you haven't even acknowledged yet in your "known issue" thread. (hint hint : the crafting DDoSing your own servers)
---
Also, we desperately need "content". Preferably real one, not gimmicks turning all players hostiles to each other.
---
They just should have a "dump" or "Display" option while in C.A.M.P of your inventory. 
---
The same engine that they used on Morrowind in 2002 is essentially what we see today in FO76 and what we will see in Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6. They've just added onto it and rebranded it (Gamebryo, then Creation Engine) so they don't have to pay for/develop another game engine.
---
Fallout 76 is proof that the engine is bloated, old and needs to be put out of its misery.
---
Another day, another fuckugly 'skybox' camp with a locked door taken care of..
---
I've taken to writing up small guides for beginners, and creating coherent quests in my head with the small bits and pieces of lore they put in the game. 
---
Thank you for being a thorn. It's people like you who make their job so much easier, if theyd just listen. I really believe the community could have this game fixed and functioning in a couple of weeks if Bethesda actually listened. 
---
It just works! 
---
Are you running the game in borderless-windowed mode?
---
Oh they don't have to be. You use one high budget item as measurement. If the workshop budged is large you'd might need to use several of them.
---
Then you can measure anythng else againts that, using it as unit. 
---
Sure it was much easier for me when I only needed to compare a turret againts a spotlight. I wasn't even storing them by your way, I just build them and observed how the budged gauge moves.(or not don't move, in case of spotlights)
---
It's pretty close to being full but I don't usually put anything in it because I don't need anything else. If I need something I go and farm for it. I keep pretty much all my weapons on me because I have a full set of weapon weight reduction armor. I have like 30 weapons on my character at all times for absolutely no reason other then I can't bring myself to drop or give them away haha.
---
St. Atom don’t call me…
---
The company only replies when its something good like when you have those weekly "Thank you Multi-billion dollar conglomerate...I mean Bethesda, for fixing one bug" etc
---
Also notice how it's often "We're listening" but Bethesdas actual actions seem to suggest the opposite. Take Pete Hines for instance, he's been absolutely off the radar when it comes to F076 and the only times he appears on Reddit [is to thank his fanboys.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9pjss1/pete_hines_is_getting_so_much_shit_on_twitter/e83gthw/?context=0&amp;st=js2s54su&amp;sh=894f6216)
---
&gt;Never said they were all God rolls with 3 attachments.
---
but you did say
---
&gt;That is a made up statistic. 
---
in response to me saying that the chances of rolling a god 3\* are 0.000001%, so anyone would assume you rolled 6 god ones. the chances of rolling a 2\* are much better.
---
&gt;You are pulling stuff out of thin air like that percent.
---
like I said, even though we don't know the exact numbers, you just have to multiply the % to get a rough estimate. the list I posted above is a good start. I just did and got 0,000005%
---
&gt;I've played since beta. Hbu?
---
not, only since release. clocked around 1000 hours.
---
Dear Bobby,
---
        Signed the Keebler Elf Todd Howard
---
Worth noting (I am that devils advocate) the Bethesda fan base is the kind that puts THOUSANDS of hours into a single title, squeezing every last drop of content out..  
---
So when one of those maniacs (I mean it in a affectionate way) says it's unplayable after 300 hours, it be like the average person after 3, or 30 hours.  
---
To the average person they've gotten more than their money's worth out of it, but to them it's less than 10% of what they expected.  
---
Right or wrong, it helps to know where the other side is coming from.
---
Hahahahhahahhaha that also requires the weapon keyword!  
---
Man you've nailed all the issues!
---
“Game will probably die”
---
Everybody says this but I don’t think you realize that that is not how games work.
---
Maybe I dunno it’s the fact the game gets buggier the more patch’s that are released. I’m kinda over my munitions only working when it suits them. Or my gear disappearing, both which started last patch so yeah I dunno maybe the games broken lol
---
When I created my first character and spawned in the vault there was 2 other people just ahead of me and called me nothing but the N word for an hour, following me around the entire time.
---
This game isn't that unique, it has both good and bad players playing it.
---
I can craft it for u - 200% repair lvl legs and torso with calibrated shocks and motion assist servos for Max carryweight...
---
Caps 1500 or trade with bos under amor...
---
PSN: Frank1971 
---
&gt;Me or the other guy?
---
the other guy- obviously. reading comprehension, man.
---
&gt;my armor is a hodgepodge of bs because I litteraly only went for the guns.
---
you can't just "go for the guns". weapons and armor drop just as random.
---
Glad to help :)
---
so the listed events without any outfits next to them have a chance of dropping any of the listed cosmetics above?
---
for that region 
---
Some of it is caused server lag and not an actual bug. As near as I can tell it's because the shot registers locally which gives you the correct animation, but doesn't register on the server so it "corrects" the health meter. You'll notice it happens more when your internet is under strain.
---
It does as of the latest patch. You do have to hit "search" to activate your chance at an extra.
---
&gt; no restore involves duplicating files which is why it's called a "restore".
---
Yeah, it's clear you can't see any need because you only talk about the perspective of someone who lost items from stash.
---
See, you have lots of nice, or crappy items in store. You lose them, by dropping them into the ground.
---
Ooh, lucky your friend picks them up.
---
Then, you create a ticked and CS, as you called it, restores your stash. Duping on demand.
---
So no, they can't really do that. They need to have a log so with high probability they can see, that you actually lost them from stash.
---
Love to see some (helps break the monotony of these god(s) damned bug reports and posts).  
---
I really hope I'm (we) are not pissing into the wind (pardon the crude analogy) and they are using it.  
---
Part of what spawned all of this was the post from a couple weeks ago, calling them out for not using what we have given them, and "calling their bluff" (intended or perceived) and doubling, then quadrupling down on the information. 
---
If it does all go to waste, well, I can walk away atleast feeling smug? Lol
---
I totally agree. I’m still blown away that the only thing that *requires* a group is the SBQ, and honestly now that I’ve said that, I’d like the chance to 1v1 her sometime to see what her health pool is really like without scaling for others.
---
I personally think that’s bad design when it comes to an online game that was specially designed to introduce multiplayer to the series. I think the  *intense* backlash towards Bethesda when they first revealed it would be multiplayer and only online pushed the game design to barley deviate from solo play in mind.
---
The Watoga High School event is meant for multiplayer (and it can be FUN when a few people actually intend to play it that way).
---
Hunter Hunted is the only event that require two players other than SBQ.
---
I wonder if, when Vaults are released, they’ll be so-able too. I can see another huge wave of toxic backlash coming from solo only players if they’re not, but the same backlash if there’s no real necessity to band together to defeat end game content.
---
Yeah as in I dropped everything I found. Grammer specification man. I'm not arguing with you.
---
Even without that mutation I find vats useless. I use talons on both my melee and sniper build. In saying that my sniper build can one hit anything with powerfist too...so most times I just use that these days.
---
They really need to add the "offer window" every other MMO since the dawn of time has had..  
---
I have absolutely no trouble hitting a stealthed opponent either in melee or with a rifle. 
---
One way to develop that skill is to practice with a teammate who has a chameleon armor piece. As long as they crouch, they'll be stealthed, and you can "fight" each other without dealing real damage.
---
Then, exercise the final part of our ingenious plan: 
---
Squarely blame Bethesda for your own behavior.
---
Man. Im learning so much
---
Thats key
---
Then you have shitty rng. Once again, I never typed the words "God rolls" when reffering to my guns. We were discussing Tse and you decided to call me a liar. Do something other than play the game. 
---
Rad worms increasing all player effects by 50% Needs to be TOP Priority! Please remove ANYTHING that makes this game fun/exciting/less grindy asap! 
---
There really is no excuse at this point. The developers have a forum full of reports, suggestions and crucial feedback for a game that so many of us are hanging in there and hoping they fix. If at this point they ignore all of that then they are only destroying their own fan base and killing potential future sales. Which is so sad because fallout has such an incredible fan base and this game in particular had MASSIVE potential to really become an amazing thing. 
---
I still play. But I now play the game without thinking of what it could be. It's just a time killer, grind fest. I like that it's a bit more relaxed than other online games I play, but I've stopped expecting it to become what it should be. I'm trying to invent fun things to do at this point as well. 
---
Haha,  Not if you lost a calibrated x-01 power Armor left leg like I did. That took a while to replace.
---
Yep, from the original post of this branch I had missed the mention of Harpers Ferry. I think there's only one real tunnel you can pass through in game.
---
I need 3 legs 2 chest
---
Well, I think that’s a different problem- the only people pursuing the out-of-game markets are people who are primarily looking for top tier gear. Had we something like a global auction house (which personally I do not want, for immersion reasons) it would be a whole different story. If we finally get player vending, I’d guess lots of people will be setting up camp near train stations/whitesprings and selling a lot more low-mid tier drops.
---
not the hero we want but the hero we need. i salute you for your service, sir.
---
I admittedly haven’t spent a ton of time in Fallout 76 (27 hrs) or on this board yet, but I played a few hours yesterday and realized what garbage VATS is. 95% chance of hitting the target yet I never hit it. I thought I must be missing something. I’m glad to know it’s broken not me 😂 aiming and shooting works a lot better!
---
The December 11th and Jan 10th patches devastated "windowed" mode.  
---
Pre-December patch I got 100fps + in 3440x1440, and lost 30 FPS with that patch.  
---
The Jan 10th patch cost me another 30 - 40 FPS.  
---
If I play windowed, like most sane people with more than one monitor, I can't break 35 FPS.  
---
**TL:DR**  
---
See if your in windowed mode, if you are Bethesda screwed you and you need to switch out of it
---
My 2nd character is lvl 18 and when I went to WS last night there must have recently been a nuke— glowing lvl 58 ghouls and irradiated flora. I stumbled upon one and it chased me all the way to the gatehouse where a sentry, assaultron, and gutsy took it down. I has tagged it and it dropped a lvl 50 anti armor 50 cal. I then tagged all the other ghouls in the row of townhomes and led them all back to the gatehouse and picked up a metric shit tonne of legendaries.
---
It would be funny if someone reported you for duping springs and receive a ban for it. Even though it was legitimate work.
---
I am not bashing the game I want that to be made clear. I just find it to be weird that certain things in the game don't force player interaction more. I find it weird and as a result I never spec into ANY charisma perks I find them useless. I mean why would I invest in team oriented perks when every one in the team is on opposite sides of the map all the time....I joined a team yesterday not once did we all meet up some where for a hour or two not once did a single one of us meet. I mean it shouldn't be all on me to fast travel to some one to tag along like that.
---
Still trying to figure out WTF they did in the Dec and Jan patches to just wreck borderless windowed mode, in BETA and until Dec 11th patch j got 100 FPS in borderless windowed 
---
I should've been more specific, that's my bad.  I agree nonlegendaries shouldn't drop legendaries with the exception of the sbq, though if they can make certain garbage kinds of legendary combos spawn (hunter's brass knuckles lolwhy) I would be okay with high end monsters like behemoth, mirelurk queen, and normal scorchbeasts having a small chance to drop them.  I haven't seen a legendary any of those yet so. I do think legendary enemies should have a guaranteed legendary drop rate corresponding to their legendary level, so 2* drops 2 level 1 legendaries or 1 level 2 legendary; 3* drops 3 level 1's or 1 level 1 and 1 level 2 or 1 level 3.
---
The mirelurk queen alone needs better drops, I run about 350 damage resistance and she still hits hard for what I usually get out of her.  I don't really use my XO1 PA so, how's she so easy for you?
---
If I had a dime for every shill who had played the game for less than 60 hours and made a post like this; Man... I would have enough to not give a shit about not being allowed to get a refund. 
---
Ok... 500 caps a pcs... look me up on psn - Will be online tonight... app 12 hours from now, maybe a little sooner...
---
Thanks :).  
---
Several other pages coming soon, but anything I've not just covered please post and I'll add.  
---
Trying to crush Bethesda under the weight of our information 
---
Echoing many of own thoughts...  
---
Still holding out a little hope 
---
Ok will try to come up with that we are new that's alot of caps
---
Damn a NV upgraded to look as visually amazing as Fo76, would be a blockbuster for them, thus it will never happen.
---
Now for 1000 screws.
---
Yeah like 4 or 5 patches ago, and then have said nothing about it since.
---
It's Bethesda...switch a light break the house
---
The supportiveness is making me tear up so hard right now 😭.
---
I'm in the same boat. Clearing the Whitespring of missle turret camps ain't much, but it's honest work.
---
I second this emoticon.
---
I'm already at like 760 so I'm getting there
---
Is this power armor version or black Friday prices? 
---
Probably the other main benefit would be easy to see all fan-collected bugs at once in one place and easier to grasp the sheer scope of this game's issues, which I think most people don't fully realize. Could make it easier to maintain list. Could prompt better response from Bethesda. But I agree re: work/cost vs reward analysis. The sad thing is that fans have always spent their own unpaid time to fix Bethesda's games for them. And here we are, wanting to do it again, except this time we don't have any tools, we can only gather the issues and wish that Bethesda showed as much interest in fixing the bugs as fans have.
---
That’s what I run. 1/15/1/4/5/15/15
---
I would probably uninstall the game honestly lol. My base is right next to camp McLintock so a good run with all of the clipboards there will get me like 35 springs in one sweep. I always pick up clipboards and pocket watches and make regular runs to sugar Grove to stock up on them.
---
His many times go they have too keep saying something, when there’s no set time frame for?
---
The you’d just complain they repeated themselves.
---
I'm impressed
---
Myself and my friends have adopted a different tactic. We know where griefers like to build, and they’re terrible at hiding themselves beforehand, so we regularly take note of the location of multiple +100s. Any ones along the border are marked for attack at the next nuke drop, and other ones are pin-marked.
---
I just spend my time destroying an office tower (including a decon) because they were dumb enough to blow up my generator. I enjoyed it immensely.
---
I do like the idea of being able to see them all, however my (and others) heads would likely explode when / if that occurred.   
---
Don't want to know what bug submission number I'm on.  
---
If you can give me a sample database to input data is be game for trying it once or twice, or seeing if we could make a example template that would auto import and fill the fields..
---
I’ve gotten my money’s worth several times over at 450 hours. I’m satisfied with the monetary investment.
---
However, the time investment and emotional investment are harder to judge. The commitments from BGS from Pre-release to now have simply not been met. I think most of us can agree with that although there will be a huge range of degrees.
---
If you excitedly played the BETA like my gaming community did, you encountered problems that persist in the current version. I entered multiple tickets about the issues, offered picture and video evidence, and didn’t do it for a YouTube Channel. I did it because I believed my role as a Beta tester and a long time Fallout gamer was to identify these glaring issues.
---
It only occurred to me need the end of the beta that there was no way they’d be able to fix much of anything before they launched. What was the real point of the beta? Was it to increase pre-order sales? Because that’s why I pre-ordered.
---
I love this game. The 400+ hours say that for me. To me it is not garbage. It’s clearly not unplayable. I’m still having fun. I plan to continue to play,
---
But the emotion that I feel when I focus on Bethesda has handled this game, from Pre-release until right now, is betrayal. Todd has become a four letter word. I *am* still waiting for that roadmap they promised. I’m waiting on a lot of promises.
---
So you can actually love Fallout 76 and hate how Bethesda has handled it. They are failing hard at responding to a really failure-laden release. They need to do a lot to fix their reputation.
---
Isn't instigating only useful for the first hit? Seems like a bad option for the miniguns
---
Would make them a hole heck of a lot more useful.
---
&gt;En
---
im having the same problem &amp; im also 9/10 commendations. i restarted my console and its been 3 days, none of the enclave events are showing up. 
---
so did they ever show up for you? how did you complete the mission also? i rather not kill scorch beasts again (too difficult)
---
Fortunately I haven’t encountered a single unfriendly person. If I run away for any reason, it’s because higher-level players try to dump stuff on me and I don’t have any space for it, but I don’t want to seem mean by rejecting their gift or selling the stuff. I’m still very appreciative, but I just can’t hold onto a bunch of awesome level 50 weapons at level 30. I still wave before leaving at least, though.
---
It is funny how people come here cry, gets some upvotes, someone do "toxic" comment get upvotes, and if there is any post about game info, or anything like that it gets downvoted or rise up with 52456421upvotes. Crazy page :D
---
When can we have stairs that don't look terrible and railings that don't look like they've been made by two 10 year old kids building a tree house?
---
AND
---
A building system that doesn't have a stroke every time we work with stairs and floor platforms? I'm tired of rebuilding entire structures to accommodate the special needs of the stairs.
---
Well, the mods, if you can find them at vendors, are app 300 caps each + building materials that include violet flux... a fair price imo... 
---
But as stated willing to trade for bos underamor or rare plans I dont have... mods for x-01 are also of interest 
---
I will be online in weekends at this hour, if you need to collect caps u can look me up saturday/sunday this week 
---
Max lvl on the legs and torso?
---
yep, I got all the tapes, checked in the fallout wikia
---
*You’re* the danger.
---
Until around level 20 don't bother repairing your gear. When your stuff breaks you can craft new ones for cheaper than repairing it (unless of course it's a legendary). Scrap all the weapons, you'll learn mods that way. Take workshops when you run across them, you'll get useful items and new plans from them. Screws, springs, aluminum and adhesive are more valuable than caps, hoard them. Don't fear high level players, if one approaches you they most likely want to give you things, look for a brown paper bag at their feet. If by chance you run into a rare griefer just block them for the session and/or server hop. You should stick to The Forest until around level 15, and push into the Toxic Valley next. Listen to all the holotapes and read all the terminals. 
---
Most of all just enjoy your time in Appalachia!
---
For a game that has griefing and bullying, I don't think text chat is a good option. Unless by default it's turned off 
---
Still bugged.  I did it twice today- both times wearing the clown suit from the cave entrance all the way to the final confrontation with the wendigo.  After killing it, I looted it's worthless corpse and noted the quest no longer appeared in Side/Miscellaneous.
---
Next time I logged in, it was back.
---
&gt;Then you have shitty rng.
---
math isn't rng. multiply 0,0434782608695652 * 0,1428571428571429 * 0,1111111111111111 and tell me what it nets you. that on top of everything else.
---
&gt;Once again, I never typed the words "God rolls" when reffering to my guns. We were discussing Tse and you decided to call me a liar.
---
let's dissect your first post in direct response to me, then:
---
&gt;Once again. Not true.
---
right off the bat **you**'re the one calling me a liar.
---
&gt;I've had 6 and none were bought.
---
first, you didn't specify that they weren't god rolls until later. second, we weren't discussing TSEs, I was talking about god rolls in my original post, hence why I said "TSE + % damage while aiming". that's a god roll. so the logical conclusion is that you rolled 6 god rolls.
---
&gt;That is a made up statistic.
---
I never outright called you a liar, what I said is that I found hard to believe anyone organically rolled 6 god rolls. but I did imply, heavily, that you can't into math. I'll just say it to your face if you prefer, though.
---
&gt;Do something other than play the game. 
---
maybe you should play more so you'd learn a thing or two.
---
I know lol. Like we care when people are quiting
---
After the shit they receive daily I am not surprised. 
---
Go away.
---
I have a 1000 gold, but springs are way more useful. 
---
yeah bos plans have completely disappeared.   
---
Now if this was in the real world I would prefer 1,000 good over 1,000 springs haha 
---
Awesome C.A.M.P., nice work u/redmad, thanks for sharing :) 
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
I will start caring about “dupers” the day that the game is stable enough that items don’t randomly disappear from people’s inventory anymore.  
---
Like the Black Bird power armor paint please, I missed that and still kicking myself.
---
I tried it when I was doing the radium challenge, couldn't say if it made much difference though. Good luck on your mission! 
---
No one else can tell you your own opinion. You own the game so play it and hate it or like it. That's on you.
---
What console? 
---
You could have taken the family out to a mediocre dinner with the money you wasted.
---
Nope. We just need passive cards for lockpicking, hacking, eating, drinking, ect. But 76 special points to freely build with? Trust me you don't want to deal with the builds that would surface. God I am dreaming of what I could do with that much more points. Except it doesnt look much like a build at that point.
---
Serious question...
---
With a game like fo76 that was expected to have years of post release development... how on earth was this business model supppsed to work?
---
They took everyone's $60 (less 2 weeks later) up front. There is no sunscription fee. There was never supposed to be micro transactions or ptw shit. There's the atom store, but you earn atoms just playing.
---
So my point is... how were they ever going to justify sinking tons of money in to ongoing dev team for years with no revenue return? I honestly dont understand. The only thing that comes to mind is paid expansions/dlc, but they said publicly that dlc content would also be free.
---
Does anyone know what the plan was?? Or how this business model makes any sense??
---
Come on I'm funny. 
---
Reminds me of Spartacus Legends.
---
Okay i sent you a request
---
Sent you a request
---
Tell your friend to get a job and stop sponging off us entitled gamers who work.
---
I LOL'd and put you back to 1 point
---
Hell yeah. 
---
If you have friends that play it I think it would be worth starting a character and giving it a try.  I only play it 3-5 hours per week and I love the fallout experience it gives.
---
It's a multiplayer fallout, which is something I've wanted since fo3. 
---
Thanks.
---
4. Elder scrolls online is more different than the single player games than 76 is from other fallout games in my opinion. I went in expecting elder scrolls with friends and was severely disappointed with another generic MMO. The voiced quests are cool, but it doesn’t feel like elder scrolls to me *at all* outside of the story/lore.
---
76 *does* feel like a fallout game with friends to me. It has a ton of problems, but at its core, it *plays* like a fallout game. 
---
It's strange, but while I played BF1, I hoped that sometimes, casually, while staying too much in the trench, a message with a disease death appear. It would be historically correct
---
Look for the event wolf pack and do it often early (you can fast travel to the event without having discovered the area).Chance for three legendary items. Lvl 5-10 ,but Almost always 1*. 
---
Scrapping doesn't give you mods, but it *can* teach you plans. 
---
Yeah, fuck, paid full price on faith with one of 2 companies I’d go in that ledge for.
---
I’ll make it up for what I don’t spend paying for the new ES installment.
---
I've said this before on a similar post:  Bethesda has promised to increase the stash again when   the servers are stable. 
---
Which is another way of saying that it will never be increased. 
---
The big difference is that Bioware actually cares deeply about its fanbase. Which reflects in the community interaction of the subreddit.
---
Also, play around with some weapon types, look up weapon comparisons and perk lists before you start to specialize your build. For now, heavy explosives ( missile launcher and fat man) and energy weapons are a bit under powered. Workshops are also a good way to gain good xp.  Plant an adhesive farm at your camp. Levels on enemies are more of a guideline rather than a hard cap on who you should fight (within reason). Read and listen to as much lore as you can find, there is a wealth of lore and depth to the stories you'll read if you just pay attention. Running events is also a good way to gain xp and stuff. There are 7 different factions with vendor robots. For now, you'll probably only be able to access the responders and the raiders bots (sutton station will be the closest to flatwoods), each faction vendor shares the same daily cap of 200 caps for a total of 1400 total caps eventually to be available to you.  When running solo, lone wanderer is a great perk, straight up damage reduction is better than damage resistance any day of the week. Put at least 2 points into charisma (total chr 3) so you can share a level 1 perk with teammates (3 chr required per star shared). Armor comes in 3 layers, under armor (e.g. vault suit, marine wetsuit), your standard armor pieces and the cosmetic outfits
---
 There is only 1 cosmetic outfit that provides any stat boosts, tattered dress for +1 per. Head gear is purely cosmetic.
---
&gt; where these two franchises compete primarily on pixel-perfect polish and bling.
---
fuckin lmao no they don't, especially not battlefield. Battlefield 5 had a bug where you couldn't gain in-game currency as you're supposed to after hitting level cap *that was around for months*, it still has a bug where being revived in odd ways can softlock you in a downed state until you're revived. There's also the occasional bug out where you die and you softlock in the respawn screen with the only option being to alt+f4.
---
Those game's aren't "pixel-perfect polish", they're just acceptable. FO76 isn't even a tenth of the way to "acceptable".
---
&gt;A game that just doesn't bother aiming for these levels of polish and bling 
---
"A game that just doesn't bother meeting the minimum standards of quality assurance"
---
Yikes, imagine having some sort of weird psychological attachment that released a unfinished, sub-par product with microtransactions tacked on and still hasn't fixed it.
---
Kill one player, change a number and repeat until you feel its right, correct?  That all there is to it?
---
What about plasma efficiency compared to laser?  The efficiency of all energy weapons vs ballistic/explosive/melee.  Interactions with armor and resistance types.  Interactions with legendary affixes?  Interactions with different enemy types?  Mutations?
---
It's super simple to say "just make them do more damage, but not too much."  Testong and getting a good balance that every player will be happy with is literally impossible.  Everyone will feel like they're OP or underpowered, unless they do the exact same. Then you'll have people complaining that they're redundant.  
---
Initially I was solo. Through PvP I met other players and would later go on to team with them.  I’ve also met fellow traders on here that I may occasionally team with.  I rarely go solo now. 
---
Recently I met what some would consider a griefer. I thoroughly enjoyed our shenanigans (and made a fair amount of caps from it).  Sure, we pissed off a bunch of people, but met several who took it in stride and became friends. 
---
Having voice chat is what changed this for me. When I was solo, I didn’t have a mic and rarely teamed. Many players used to single player games don’t use mics, making it hard for them to communicate since the only other option is the piss poor emote system.  
---
Yes I agree that's annoying but that's always because they are dicks and are In a seperate party chat to the games and they just troll people by making them join them pissing off and not doing anything with said teammate. 
---
And if you're on ps4, feel free to add me (ask for psn) and my alternate lower lever character will team up to help and offer more tips as they become relevant 
---
Angry widdle babyy who'll always be $60 ahead of you. :)
---
*Woah!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** summerof95! ^(hug)
---
Not to come off as a dick here, but I really don't think they'll add this game steam, or that anyone on here can give you access to the people that would make that call.
---
What you don't seem to understand is why it is that way.
---
Or what kind of decision you would make, if you were in the room where this course was decided.
---
It's not going to be on Steam. I also don't understand why you think it would crash less if it was sold on Steam.
---
Created by different company quite long time ago, I would not expect strong links between them and F3 and later.
---
Side lore like this is fairly integral to Fallout, but not specific side lore. You kinda expect to have alies or strong references to them, but they don't have to be a specific species. Same thing with cults and (black) magic and other superstitious elements.
---
we have a plan to increase stash size this year. also buy our shit from the ATOM shop. thx bye
---
no i meant the bethesda launcher lol
---
Dude are you kidding me.  I've defended this game til I'm hoarse, and have played almost daily.  I love it to death, but what kind of answer is that?  The post asks for communication and openness, and you guys post that Feed the goddamn people is getting fixed?  
---
Sweet, Scorchbeasts are finally going to be slightly more worth killing because they aren't as annoying.  The people who tane creatures will be happy.  The news rad worms bug is gonna be gone, and accidentally hitting someone's stuff isnt going to lose you ten caps.
---
But why bother even replying with that?  It's not a response to feedback, or any kind of assurance that the team isnt one person that LadyDevan passes a sticky note to.  It doesn't make us feel like you haven't abandoned the game, or that it's just an atom store cash cow.
---
Never got around to playing that Hardcore or “Survivor” mode or whatever it was called. Would it be worth a go?
---
Fact is, facts are actual facts until proven otherwise. Kind of like lying to somebody by telling them the truth. XD
---
None that I could find. Confirmed to be caused by thrown knives that stick into objects in the world to be picked up again.
---
On logging in again, it also appears to look like I have two throwing objects equipped.

Eh, man, it’s nit just the suits. This game is full of a whole lot of bad design choices. Half the weapons are useless because the damage/armor rating mechanic is just bad, level scaling is janky, TSE was always stupid broken, legendaries are just a copy paste that was lazy in the first place (why no flavorful West Tek complements for Legendary mods and legend crafting), half assed pvpve mode and now a PvP split, unbalanced biker ssponge tedious enemies, and on and on and on...
---
There’s a lot aeong with the game’s systems and mechanics, the nuts and bolts design/dev. 
---
It seems like they had a small team mostly converting systems with no director or lead maintaining a cohesive vision.
---
The game is a few islands of inspiration (CAMP, Nuke Zone Raids, Worldbuilding) in a sea of slop and poor execution.
---
This all could have been fixed with a proper beta and development time, but here we are.
---
Yup this sounds like a solid design choice, too bad they couldn't come up with this themselves.  You'd think the testers would of reported this gaming the system aspect of it. 
---
I'm older than you and in much the same situation with one game at a time.  I played up to level 15 or so and then started over.  There is a lot of micromanaging and learning what to pick up/drop/sell; perk cards; hunger/thirst; etc.  Once you have a handle on it all the game feels a lot less forced.  
---
Since you already have the game, I'd suggest playing through the main story at the very least.  It's kind of pointless in a way but the world is great to explore and it's a 'choose your own adventure' experience.  I put the game down a few days ago at level 106, but will certainly check back in now and then for new content or just to mess around.  It's nowhere near FO3/NV/4; but it's still a fun experience in an immersive world and IMO completely worth it.
---
I had a feeling that might be the case, shame I heard the games story is meh but just looking at how awesome the games world looks to explore I may have to pass or until (probs never) its comes to steam.
---
Ok, no. This is a *AAA* company who's had **multiple game of the years** and every single release of their is **highly** anticipated. Let's go ahead and discard any sort of "financial" argument right then and there. Finances aren't an issue in this whatsoever.
---
Let's also discard the publisher issue, since Zenimax (their **parent company**) has historically been extremely hands-off with what Bethesda does and gives them a *ludicrous* amount of time to develop a product. Ironically, Bethesda isn't so kind. See Obsidian's dev time on NV.
---
Don't make excuses for a company in which they have *every resource* they need in order to release a polished product. Money? More than they could ever need. Time? Again, more than they could ever need. Knowledge? This is the area I can see them falling short in. They've had reoccuring bugs in their engine since the days of Morrowind, I genuinely believe the people that do engine work over at Bethesda are incompetent. However, this isn't a valid argument either. Bethesda has worked closely with id before. id is well known for being *excellent* at making stable, working engines. Bethesda could *easily* outsource a new engine to id for a game, **just like they did with Elder Scrolls Online, which is *really good* now**.
---
There's no excuse to be made for Bethesda. They've been allowed to get away with releasing buggy products for this long, but they decided to try something they were not only very new at (an MMO that's using the creation engine, which isn't really built for multiplayer) but now they couldn't have the modding community swoop in as they always do and fix their game for them.
---
It's a $60 product. You damn well better expect a $60 game when you pay for it. What they released was a pre-alpha of this $60 product. If they'd given it a year or two more of QA this game probably would've been great, but first impressions matter and they absolutely screwed the pooch there.
---
Here's my helpful tip: 
---
Use all the junk you find to craft a million leather left arms and scrap them. It'll help you learn all the leather mods quicker and let you easily craft better armor for the first levels.   
---
On a broader level, ignore the online cynicism and toxicity. The bugs are no bigger than what you'd already be expecting if you played F3, F:NV, F4, Oblivion or Skyrim. The game is heaps of fun, the world is really well made and the atmosphere is nice. Take your time and just play it in the way that works best for you.
---
I'm going to take it as a compliment. 
---
The community is the Lakers, Bethesda is the Pelicans,  and FO76 is Anthony Davis.
---
Ps4
---
That’s a pretty wild assumption. They very well could be additional hires, you know, expanding the team to help get the game into shape. They could just as well be working on another title. 
---
The players are the content creators 
---
The story is actually pretty good, it's just it's presentation that turns some people off. I personally dig getting all my information from reading terminals and listening to holotapes, and trying to piece it all together rather than having NPCs dropping exposition bombs on me. I get the complaints, but to me the way this game does story telling is a much more immersive experience than other games. Again, this is just my opinion on the matter.
---
Yup! After hours of stash frustrations I had tens of pounds of cloth and steel and wood... so I crafted railway spikes and sold them... 
---
Thanks for wasting my time by saying everyone should read this. Stop crying 
---
It can't?
---
Glad to waste it :)
---
Btw you get the basic concept of the thread by reading the first part. Common sense  lol
---
And the reason was something to do with the server having to track each and every item... for display in the game... makes sense because each user can interact with every object on the server but they could just set it up so that items that are in your stash or inventory are removed and saved in a different space on the server so it isn’t tracked by all users on the server. Free up memory, and let us store more stuff in our stash!!
---
I honestly don’t even care about feedback and communication.
---
Just fix the game. Bring in more people. Delay your other projects. Spend the money. Take the loss. Just. Fix. It.
---
Not this trickle that breaks as much as it fixes. It’s been 3+ months and the game isn’t 1/10th towards being release quality.
---
Either do it right or don’t do it. Offer blanket refunds and an apology stating you realize you rushed it out before it was done and have learned the lesson, then let it die.
---
But just half assing this and waiting for us to give up while a skeleton crew keeps up pretenses and you can pretend you actually tried isn’t in anyone’s interest.
---
Let’s be honest. You didn’t just do it right when making the game, you didn’t just do it right and devote the proper resources to fixing it and you won’t now - because you still haven’t learned anything from your mistakes.
---
Pink is not wasteland gear?
---
I can vouch that this is an extremely viable build. I run a very similar melee build with all mutations (at least til I have money to buy the serums I want). I am lv 54 and use a 1* vampires mole miner gauntlet (extra claw mod). I can one hit just about anything, scorchbeasts take about 4-5 hits once they land or I can use marsupial to jump to them if theyre over a hill or tall building. For my backup i run a 1* vampires tesla rifle (charging barrel and reflex sight). The vampire effect is really useful with the low health, especially since a lot of the time things are dead before they get many shots in (if any). Today I killed a lv 60 player in excavator armor in 1 hit.
---
I had the same thing trying to take down a wanted player, multiple times I took their hp to 0 and it when right back even have a video
---
Preventing griefers is a 1,000% cop out answer.  They need to have HP/endurance scale with level, and have Pacifist Mode completely disable player damage/protect bases from attack from players.  
---
It's creating it's own griefing due to lower level players hunting high level players as like others have said past level 50 all things are equal and even damage being scaled to benefit to the lower level player.
---
I routinely go on my level 63 character and hunt 150+ level players to get caps as they all die just as easily with melee.  If I'm on my 253 level character I get a 10c bounty first and PvP.  
---
Their systems are not working as intended as they have inherit exploit mechanics built in.  
---
Interesting. That would be the first mistake I've found in here:
---

---
Pink is a wasteland gear, I loved the pink powe armor skin in FO4, but there's too much "funny" and too less "hard" things
---
It Just Works!
---
Pleasant valley resort and station
---
Finish rose missions
---
I do not mean to word-smith, but what I got from your sentence was just that.   Unable.   I wholeheartedly agree that killing them is not worth it though.
---
I wouldn't mind pinky and colorful things if we had dark and gloomy things too... But we don't.
---
&gt; I wish Bethesda gave a fuck like EA. I can't believe I just wrote that. 
---
Oh my gods, that is a stone cold burn!
---
I don't mind any of that gear and would gladly wear any of it in fo76 even if it did come only through the atom shop, but there is one item I think we will never see in this game and that is the Chinese stealth suit even however much we would like it. How game breaking would it be with loads of players who are perminantly cloaked even whilst crouching and moving 
---
Pink is the hardest color. 
---
A data-miner said the Radium Rifle has its own table for scrapping. All other weapons have one table with four different chances (5/10/15/20%), while all armors have one table with everything having the same unlock chance. Radium Rifle and armor chances do seem similar though.
---
Oh, the lever action. Such a nice weapon with the right perks on. I love it. 
---
I have a Fire axe that does Bleeding Damge..... 
---
Lower my hp the higjer the damage..... It can do a Good 300-400 hp of damage.... Its pretty sweet.... 
---
Sorry but I can't remember there is an heart painted on it right?
---
And if you hit level 250? Go you, I'm sure you can fit 600+1250 worth of items in there.
---
What do you expect to us to say? Most of us are here because we play and like the game, even with all the shit that we dislike. If you don't want to play a game you bought, that decision is in your own, but for me it looks like wasted money...
---
I did her missions, was it a terminal for schematics I missed?
---
The parts, Toxic Valley container and treasure maps. The mods, Pleasant Valley Ski vendor.
---
It does. 
---
You can get them as a one-time reward per character for finishing the Signal Strength quest.
---
Congratulations. This thread is **exactly about you**. You're in the right place. 
---
1. You're very good at repeating that bullcrap like a drone. 
---
1.5. It is bullcrap. It's **opinion** of people who are in the business of selling you opinion.
---
2. Here's why: Because **none of that bullcrap would inform your decisions if you were a decision maker designing a game.**. Your decisions would be made based on other things. What you wrote above is just sensationalist media drivel.
---
3. Why the game is as (im)mature as it is and why the decisions that led it to be so were made this way - in all likelihood has good reason. Not to someone whose cup is so full of that above I paid $60 I deserve shit gunk, but to someone with less strong opinion and more capacity to listen and try to understand, and maybe even try to place themselves in that position, work out what they'd decide, and not pass judgement at least until they did this.
---
4. And finally, if you do want to pass judgement, you can start with what decisions you'd make in their place. I know you have no idea, because the games media people whose for-profit opinions you are parroting above have no idea, and never told you about the the options design teams face, and why they may choose to turn the knob in the direction of shipping a product earlier rather than later (hint: it's not the greed motive you probably got fed).
---
Finally, your $60 bit. I'm (trying to, with a bit of success) carefully avoid sliding into condescending territory and giving you a bit of respect, but just so that you know, your $60 does **not** entitle you to that attitude, the Bethesda box doesn't have some magic "AAA" sticker on it that implies it's this tall or that wide or this mature or this blue, "AAA" is just the opinion of some guy on the internet.
---
I am letting you know, in the friendliest way possible, that your "AAA title" emotional outpour and $60 diatribe brand you as a child at best, and someone beholden to the media with not an ounce of media literacy, understanding of enterpreneurship and yet a lot of arrogance at worst. 
---
Well the nest is just a bit lazy rename of deathclaw nest. With the latter it works, because their nests are flat, completely on ground and the literal nest container is just in the center of it. 
---
The engine allows items and objects to be resized at will but there's no other large container in game, it would look a bit ugly too to have that nest be made 3x as big to fit a SB. So instead, the nest container is just a small part of the larger nest construction.
---
I don't know how well it all fits to what they are supposed to be, since SB are supposed to be bats and well, that looks like a bird's nest. Which is not only their home, it's where they procreate. They have eggs. While some mammals deviate a bit from the stardard , I'm pretty sure bats are fairly close to normal mammals.
---
But that's clearly a nest. It's a huge creature so it builds it using cars and other large things. Those metal poles with spikes are funny as it's very bird like, certain bids using bushes ect which have spikes. But the odd thing is they don't look to have any human function. Too thick to be antennas, too small spikes to be any kind of fixed barbed wire.
---
But when you take account they didn't make it fit perfectly to what's it's supposed to be, it's an SB nest. It contans stuff it's half eaten, it's inspired from bird nests as the SB and birds at least both fly.
---
I haven't done Enclaive yet which explants a lot of SB but from what I've read, they were created by them, then after lab accident they queen was relocated to some huge caves(possibly glassed cavern or possibly that is just a small portion of the cave systems). But those caves are simply too small for the huge ass things as they grow up, so they pop out literally through the ground,  and then just fly around and kill everything until they are killed. At least the Vault 76 survivors are doing a heck better job at it than Brotherhood, Responders never had any chance and the Enclaive branch in West Virginia had their internal problems I believe.
---
So, after any single individual leaves their caves, they live and die outside.
---
I did notice you made a new post about these things, if you wish to continue lets do it there. Although I don't believe there is any stronger more involved background to the statues and possible a cult behind them, it's very entertaining and intresting to think about these small substle clues that have been layed out in the world. Even if a lot of the game is half-finished and half-baked, I've always had the impression Bethesda carefully makes the world, making it deeper than what on the surface level.
---
That beehive like intrusion into the building, I think that's probably just a side effect on what particular graphics objects they desided to use when making the nests. After all it's not normally intented to be visible at all, so it's not part of the experience made for players.
---
It's for St Valentine, it's ok i've said it
---
sweet hopefully that makes it easy to fix, good work fellow human!
---
I can say I do this too in fo4 and skyrim, i have never bought anything extra in those games other than when it's been free lol
---
We have to accept the game is how the game is.
---
Actually, CAMPs are easy to destroy by any random lifeless scrub with no better ideas in his tiny brain.
---
So if we build, we have to count with that possibility or to be prepared to react fast, leaving the server or something...
---
Yeah that was the only power armor paint so far that was worth getting and like you I didn't get it because I didnt have the atoms at the time 
---
An actual moderated radio station is a must have! I don't count Roses since she just has like 10min of text and no music. Even Fallout 3 had a Radio Station with a robot.
---
Wouldn't have helped me. The spawn point for my old base was in the middle of a river, so I had around a 50/50 shot at contracting parasites each time I fast-travelled there without putting on the PA.
---
Fortunately that base also had a full set of disease cure ingredients.
---
We are no longer the target audience of the Fallout franchise. 
---
Upvotes confirm this
---
Not too sure on this but I'm sure I saw pipers trench coat in a data mine I saw for fo76  
---
Agreed. My point or question I guess is how someone has the capability to act in such a way. The weirder part was his wanted level never rose above 30. I uno, anyone can call this what they want it's just hard to believe some of the "best and brightest chosen for vault 76 " are such assholes. 
---
it is amazing
---
Yes,  I have tried everything and submitted a ticket too.
---
The broken quest: Order of Mystery: Novice.
---
Its broken because I have the Novice Holotape and listen to it.  Afterwards, it tells me to log into Crypto to research the 3 items.  
---
When accessing Crypto, it says to select one of the logins listed below.  There is none.  Complete blank. Pressing E wont do anything.  
---
Thus I am unable to proceed.  I cannot log into the chemistry workstation either.
---
TSE nerf says otherwise 
---
how many caps a piece?
---
I have tamed multiple creatures (mega sloths, yao guai, deathclaw, etc) with only 3 charisma. Only level 3 animal friend equipped, obviously, and I have tamed several deathclaws who were 20 levels higher than me. So the rules seem to be fishy. I had no boosts to my charisma from equipment. 
---
correct
---
It's pretty much assured most Bethesda games are going to be exclusive to their store and launcher now.  Their launcher seems to be their way of assuring 100% of the money goes to them instead of having portions cut from Steam, and Valve still takes a pretty significant cut.
---
Bethesda is actually late to the party, since almost every other AAA developer has released their own launcher and store to sell their games on, and dropped it from other stores to maximize their income too.
---
Thanks for the fast answers
---
Hmm thanks.   I will load it up again on my system and try it again.  This will be third attempt at getting into it.  Anno 2070 was much better IMO.
---
I’m going to add, keep radworms bugged, just fix it so it wears off correctly 
---
Bethesda is good at making bugs, when they make good ones, they should embrace that. 
---
It should give you quest markers if the quest is active. If not, The Mire is a good place to find radtoads and there's a Snallygaster that always spawns in Charleston.
---
I was surprised by the manta man one, it looks way better than in their pictures as is really high quality. The Cape really gives a great super hero look, especially if you have the muscle on your character cranked up to the max. I then use the 'war band' favepaint from the atom shop using different colours to look like a bandana covering the eyes.
---
Black for the silver shroud, light blue for manta.
---
It looks great
---
Takes off my tux...
---
In an ideal world I'd wish this too but highly doubtful if they can make money from it, this is the state of current AAA games and game companies at the moment, never happy with just getting our initial money buying the game they have to sponge even more from us to please investors and share holders
---
Where’s my fucking Blackbird paint, you lumbering slunts?
---
I'll try to find them, but do you have a specific spot in Charleston?
---
oh I had to re equip the quest, thanks!
---
I believe that you can not learn BOS Legs from scrapping.
---
Interestingly, many people including me report seeing the BOS Combat Legs mod unlock when scrapping, but it doesn’t actually work when you try to mod combat legs of any type.
---
I hope I can save you the thousands of plastic and other materials I farmed to scrap combat armor for no reason.
---
100% agree
---
Im also over 40 and couldn't disagree with you more. Game certainly doesn't lack content unless you rushed to the end, FULL STOP
---
Bugs? yeah. Balanced? nope. But I am loving the story and the tapes and the lore
---
Oddly enough, flux ingredients (Hardened &amp; Glowing Mass, HR Fluids) seem to be global, so only one player gets them. Same with any harpoons, railway spikes or crossbow bolts. Everything else is player-specific, as far as I know.
---
Good idea! But title like “mini nuke should mutate flora” would be better
---
We might see it again but honestly putting it as a 1 day event was a bit stupid , they'd have made alot more money on it if it was a regular item in the shop 
---
Probably 50
---
I'd like to think that a number of people are less aggravated upon seeing this post than before it. I'm speaking specifically of the people who read the Inside the Vault and interpreted it to mean the *only* updates coming in Patch 6 were SB related.
---
It's usually hanging around in the middle of the Firebreather obstacle course. 
---
If it worked for Harlem...

What a tool to use words like scam at your age. Get a grip.

&gt;**Issue:** **Quest does not allow repeat turn in, even with Technical Data in Inventory.** (Ticket Submitted on 02-12-2019)
---
Not a bug. It's a feature. They implemented it in one of the earlier patches to stop people "exploiting" this and getting a ton of rewards at once. It wasn't one day it was working and the next not. They put this in intentionally.
---
For daily quests, you need to add that they're not actually daily quests because they don't persist between play sessions on the same day. If you get disconnected or logout and log back in with the same day the quest is no longer there. "Daily" quests are session quest at best.

I've bought a couple of Power Armour Mods which are not appearing as crafting options. These ones don't appear to be model-specific in the title. 
---
Is there a bug or are some not available for T-60 or T-51b? 
---
Also got the prompt but can’t craft it. Felt crazy until everyone else reported the same.
---
Nowadays 
---
Ok... max lvl is 45 on this amor...
---
If they brought cool looking power armor paints full stop everyone would jump on it let alone for armors like the excavator or ultracite versions
---
&gt; how someone has the capability to act in such a way.
---
fools are everywhere!
---
In fact I am surprising of the low % of scumbags in this game. Most users are non problematic. 
---
But, sadly, it just takes one scumbag to ruin your day.
---
Bethesda wanted the game worked this way and we'll have to eat it until they change it (or not).
---
For this reason I don't even care about to build. A basic stand and a stash, that is my CAMP. If I need to craft I just do it in Flatwoods or in Whitesprings.
---
A lot of people want the Mr. Fuzzy costume.  All those people also think the grind is pretty tedious.  How about find and help some of those people by donating whatever tokens you have so they can get their costume first and then maybe they'll help you get yours?
---
(lol)
---
Nobody is the least bit butthurt over you uninstalling, by 40 you should have a better grasp of social interactions, IMHO
---
Try it. It doesn't give you anything. 
---
At least advertise that shit...by the time I saw it, there was nothing to do but be annoyed.
---
I honestly traded mine in to gamestop to fund my Kingdom Hearts 3 copy. It's sad. I wanted to enjoy FO76 with my dad. It's one game series we love together. But the broken state of the game 90% of the time made it feel less like an rpg to play together and more like a game we could role play how to manage getting it to stay launched on ps4. 
---
How cool would these skins be for Raider PA?  I'm just sayin

LOl he didn't know about the extra button press for searching
---
But thanks for illustrating how tiny minds can make BETHESDA BAAAD thoughts on every last fucking little thing
---
I wish I didn't buy psplus for this game...
---
I like having lots of stims, grenades, ammo,  food, drinks and fusion cores on me. Also like carrying around 5 different guns to switch between.  The biggest thing that bugged me right off the bat was weight management and having to fly around by the seat of your pants with bare-minimum everytheing in your inventory, hoping you'd be able to find everything you needed on the fly, wherever you went.
---
do you know if there is a chance to learn mods scrapping Raider PA parts?
---
I've turned in BOS technical plans twice - nothing. People say that they sometimes drop from Savage Divide treasure maps. Tried that too, no luck.
---
No one should read this.
---
Why are they banning people who accidentally stumble into undeveloped areas? Instead of keeping the areas offline until ready for release.
---
If Bethesda was better at monetization, they would still be supporting fo76 instead of abandoning the money pit they've created. EA knows they can't sell a buggy mess, Bethesda should know that too
---
Needless to say the woman whoms age is over 70  as well was ecstatic. So I'm glad I left them happy even though someone decided to try and ruin it lol
---
Glad I wasted your time too bud :)
---
There is not. Power armor mods are never learned this way.
---
Eh, that happens. It's not hard to rebuild though, only thing that can be annoying is if you have a decon shower. Not that I condone such things  of course. Unless you've built at Charleston station or Whitespring turret camp. Then I'll go out of my way to destroy it as thoroughly as possible.
---
Holy shit you are the Strawman Master (tm).  Good on you for doing something you love.  The best is when you whine and bitch about people whining and bitching hahaha, omg I love doz lil guyz.
---
Many of the people posting to this sub sound like they are in an abusive relationship. Get out and stop playing if it makes you sad!
---
I think I made this post so that the people who agree know of it and support helping the community. And those who dont get their time wasted reading something they didnt like haha
---
Thanks. Being sure they didn't change it… 
---
West bridge, The Crosshair are a few with pieces
---
A stack of 500 5mm ammo was claimed by a teammate before my eyes.
---
Um. stop picking up everything?
---
Limit your stash to 100 items in each junk component.  This will guarantee no issue.
---
Then tag the junk components you need.  Do not pick up anything else at all.
---
Passive perks such as lock pick, terminal hacker, and crafting perks can unlock by level. Being forced to swap them in as you do different things is a terrible implementation. 
---
"Is there some way I can contact bethesda to put it on Steam"
---
Lol yeah, they will do it just for you. Cause YOU matter. lol.
---
I am so tired of everyone complaining about 76! If you don't like it cool go find something you do like. Stop spreading negativity around and find something positive to use your energy on! Its not a traditional fallout and its got some bugs if that means it's not for you fine. Find something you enjoy elsewhere. 
---
I see you haven't tracked quest. But if you want farm snallygaster i recoment broken train depo on west of watoga. If you will be serverhoping you can have them there, lots of them. Good for acid farm.
---
You clearly want to get in the mud and throw shit at each other, rather than learn something new. 
---
I won't go in there with you. 
---
Enjoy your arrogant ignorance.
---
I'll keep that in mind, thank you!
---
Sure does. STACKING buffs. Each piece (with the Shrouded mod) makes you harder to see, and increases your sneak speed. I sneak much faster than walking speed. Enemies walk literally past me when I’m crouched. With one Chameleon piece, I’m never spotted at all. Add sneak crits + rifle perks + bloody mess and I’ve been one-shotting at Whitesprings since level 35. With a non-legendary hunting rifle. 
---
I suspect we're going to get something more like how ESO improved drastically after the one tamriel update
---
What a pointless post. Did you just want to tell us about your life?
---
Guys you already wasted time here so come and dislike my [Video that everyone must check!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg)
---
Would like to see more weapon chances. 
---
Don't be like that.  I agree with you!!!  We are already flapping our wings around in the cesspool, you dove in as soon as you made this post!  AND you're not even wrong haha!   C'mon lighten up, it's not like you're going to actually change any minds here.  This is reddit.
---
Why, oh why, do some enjoy bullying whining cunts? I'll never understand...
---
Pink Flamingos!  
---
Um...bye, I guess...?
---
Same here. Maxed out budget entirely lol
---
Got a likely long wait man

Wasnt running fireproof etc . I don't play to pvp these days. Just wander and help. Tse handmade  kind of destroyed me haha. Led him off so the others could leave world.

---
Couldn't agree more and once again the modders deliver something that Bethesda didn't, it's almost like they have lost touch with the community that buy their games  
---
The odds of one with +% damage while aiming is much higher than that. The total odds perhaps but not the off a of one with.
---
I mean if you really look at it..... the massive amount of reused assets, the same FO4 engine for a multiplayer game, the slated release, and how much content there actually is... I don't think there was any roadmap planned. Its a cash grab on the idea of fallout with friends. Bethesda is going corporate and conserving any discussion to avoid PR Nightmare. Almost everyone either loves the Fallout or Elder Scrolls Franchise so of course they don't want to hurt their name. They brought multiple studios on this project to get it up and running by one of their small studios in a small window.. probably 76 people were originally set to work on this. lol
---
For real though, it's definitely what many would call an EA title on Steam. They more than likely just have ideas tossed on a paper (on hold) till they've patched the game. Maybe another studio working on it while they patch it. Either way, after the game is at least functional and after they feel comfortable, they'll start on future content that they perceive to be good ideas only to (likely) be riddled with the Bethesda bugs.
---
It does have potential to be another notch on the belt though.
---
&gt;You're very good at repeating that bullcrap like a drone.
---
As are you. At least mine's backed by facts, or at the very least, the **very, very large majority of the gaming communities' opinions.**
---
It must get lonely being such a small minority of people. Maybe if you stopped parroting incorrect statements you wouldn't be so lonely?
---
&gt;Here's why: Because none of that bullcrap would inform your decisions if you were a decision maker designing a game..
---
Ah, I see. You're one of those people who'd counter someone's criticism with "Well how many video games have YOU made, hmmmmm?". In other words, you're at least have enough of a functioning amount of brain cells to work out that this product (FO76) **is** of terrible quality and have moved off of the topic of trying to defend the product itself, so now you're instead trying to defend the circumstances behind its creation as if that justifies it. If I go to a restaurant and order a steak, but they give me a half frozen piece of ham and the option to purchase salad with that, that's not okay. I paid for the product, deliver at least the standard of what I'd expect (a cooked steak), and I'll consider buying stuff on top of that if I enjoyed it. If I did enjoy it, I'll come back and buy more. Bethesda delivered a game that's comparable to a pre-alpha, full of microtransactions (don't worry, those are nice and bug-free :\^) ) that didn't even work half the time and is chock full of bugs, some game breaking (How 'bout that damage bug?). They also didn't deliver on all that was said to be delivered with their collector's edition, and that whole nuka dark fiasco where they half-assed the product, though I don't consider that nearly as bad.
---
&gt;Why the game is as (im)mature as it is and why the decisions that led it to be so were made this way - in all likelihood has good reason.
---
Not an excuse. Apex Legends, a **free to play** game just launched in a more polished state than this. There's no justification for a $60 game releasing in this state with a company like Bethesda behind it.
---
&gt;I can explain
---
lmao no you can't
---
&gt;though I can't penetrate the "I know better" wall of someone whose cup is so full of that "I paid $60 I deserve shit" gunk that there's no point talking to them
---
Luckily for you I know *so much* that I can decode this heavily coded message. Here's the transcript:
---
&gt;&gt;though I can't justify my heavily flawed argument for fear that every point I make will be immediately disarmed and I'll look stupid to all but the small minority who share the same opinion, therefore there's no point in me making a fool of myself.
---
&gt;To someone with less strong opinion and more capacity to listen and try to understand
---
Hilariously ironic coming from you, the person defending an objectively poor quality (when compared to industry standards) product with zero valid arguments whatsoever, lmao.
---
&gt;And finally, if you do want to pass judgement, you can start with what decisions you'd make in their place. I know you have no idea, because the games media people whose for-profit opinions you are parroting above have no idea, and never told you about the the options design teams face, and why they may (and often do) choose to turn the knob in the direction of shipping a product earlier rather than later (hint: it's not the greed motive you probably got fed).
---
&gt;&gt;Ah, I see. You're one of those people who'd counter someone's criticism with "Well how many video games have YOU made, hmmmmm?".
---
hint: it's greed. this company has no reason to have rushed a game into a pr disaster like they did, they're not lorded over by EA, money isn't an issue. ESO launched in a **much** better state than FO76 did. That got slammed (though not nearly as hard) as well, but the game itself wasn't a buggy mess. The issue was with gameplay and such, not with if the product is even playable half the time or riddled with technical issues.
---
Congratulations. You've failed to counter any point and just banged your head against points that were already objectively discarded.
---
You paid standard retail price for a product made by one of the most highly respected companies in the industry, and arguably the *best* when it comes to open world video games. You should expect a minimum viable product, not a glorified pre-alpha.
---
I am letting you know, in the friendliest way possible, that your "paying $60 for a product doesn't entitle you to receive a product that at least meets industry standards, let alone being anywhere near the level of quality expected from such a large and famous company" emotional outpour brand you as a someone who's got some seriously deep seeded buyer's remorse but for some reason deeply denies it, instead trying to convince themselves that the product they received is fine and *literally everyone else in the world* is the problem. It'd be really sad, if it wasn't also so fun to point and laugh at people like you. Do with this information what you will. :)
---
" **is that normal?** "
---
Bill you are a long time player who has done extensive trading, massive stacks of serums, TSE weapons.
---
Yet you post "Is this thing I bought from Beth disappearing normal? tee hee I'm so new I don't know!"
---
Please, just this once, be the internet guy who fesses all and explains this in plain and easy to understand terms please :)
---
haha much funnier than the post itself
---
I will stop you on numero 7.
---
Yeah it is easy for me to kill noobs. Yeah if i want i can kill whoever who owns workshop (it say you, it is pvp zone when you claim it) But when you understand atleast basic mechanics of game, you just enter pacifist mode and be never pvp active flagged.
---
I eventualy stoped using pacifist mode and still i pvp only when i want and i am sure to have first shot at full hps. 
---
People here complained there is not PVP, thats why they are doing PvP servers. People requested it!
---
Some guys complain that PvP is not thing, because we are from same vault. Those guys skiped oveseers computer, where is note, that some vault dwellers were under disciplinary lockdown (jailed). On our way to find her in appalachia we all met Rose, so there is big chance we just gave up and became raiders.
---
So am I. I go to your workshop, ask you for food, if you don't give me, i kill you and eat you. Otherwise i join hunter/hunted event, jump on monstermash or go bounty hunting. There is lots of PvP in this game, bethesda did it right, just their fanbase are somehow PvP-weak. No offence guys I get it you don't want lose junk, when i was low level i thought same, but don't say there is bad PvP.
---
They won't do it. Steam has a refund policy.
---
 Some people here complain about steam taking a cut but the cut is fine imo, people will say it's 15%+ but that number is for indie devs. AAA titles have room to negotiate with the percentage. I don't like have 100+ launchers and the alternative to steam is the epic store and their anti-consumer mentality.   
---
Well, maybe. Yeah your subject line is nasty as you really can't have level cap in online game. The "76" fits the game, and it's not huge advance over 50.
---
However anything like this should not, and will not, happen just suddenly. Other major rebalances must happen.
---
And then there's the fact that, well, you take advantage of those 26 more specials, you need 26 level ups. Do you know how long it takes for like level 200 player? Of course they could just throw us free reset, unassing all specials, and give some extras for high level players, like 5 more for anyone over 100,10 more for anyone over 150, ect. It would help a bit.
---
The real level cap is in weapons and legendary effects. After reaching about level 100 or little less or below, it takes really a lot, to continue to improve your character.(*) You can do it primary by legendary effects, and getting even good 3 star rolls is quite difficult. Getting 3 star god rolls is significantly above it.
---
I highly believe at some point we will get &gt;3 legendary effects. So bring it all together, and be patient until it happens.
---
(*) still about at level 150, I'm choosing new perk cards. I typically wait until I got about 20 or more level ups, then burn some of them. I've in total used maybe only 5 level ups into respec of specials. I used maybe 20-25 quite recently, I got 15 more free, redeveloping your perks is quite slow still. There is huge amount of perks I don't have. I don't have much shotgun perks, no melee, mostly no PA except some crafting and repair ones, no heavy weapon. Besides those I don't have much direct vats perks, not a lot of luck or endurance perks either. So, I least to me, I got plenty of use for level ups, but it's very slow to make your character stronger, as it mainly comes from getting better 3 stars.
---
Minimum 1000, maximum 2000, 2000 max cause between player vending and actually playing more than a single build, 2000 should be more than enough space for even a player who solely uses a fatman and missile launcher or a player with 4 rifles for different things or who uses a combo of both.
---
1000 minimum because player vending, like what shopkeeper wants to run out of stock for their customers?
---
I wouldn't mind incremental increases, from 400 to 600 was a good way to acclimate to a higher inventory without being reckless about space.  From 600 to 800, and 800 to 1k, to 1.2k to 1.4k and so on, and it'd be a decent way of stress testing servers for further optimizations.
---
I just don't think I'd need 2000 if not for player vending, if player vending wasn't a thing, 1.5k stash limit would be good.  I just think shops deserve 500 worth of inventory space, let us be the vendor bots, let us put 500 caps into a load screen and as people buy the cap amount grows for you to collect.  Thing is your machine or however it'll go permanently eats those 500 caps so other players can sell to you and get those caps, but like vendor bots after 20 hours 500 caps is available again, just not to the owner, the only thing available to the owner is any caps over 500 sold to the machine from something being bought.
---
Basically let us setup vendors to profit off of.  To reiterate, costs 500 caps to setup shop, anything you sell through that shop, those caps go to you, every player can see 500 caps available to get from selling stuff to your vendor and even if they 0 out your vendor you'll still receive whatever caps you gained from sold items.  You set prices, can even give your vendor up to 5k caps to give to players who sell to you, and ultimately you cannot buy from your vendor, only adjust prices and total available caps for sells and add and remove items.  Items sold to your vendor are unavailable to be bought until you price them out.  Extreme bonus points if we can set down a vendor bot and build around it like a camp a small structure and the restrictions on placement within certain areas is removed (like top floor of Whitesprings Resort or right outside of Vault 76) but to place it is a minimum 200 or 500 caps so you can't abuse it for custom fast travel spots.  I'd even be okay with 1.5k stash limit if your vendor has a 500 weight carrying capacity (or 0 cause it's most likely stationary so why bother with a weight limit unless it's to limit how much you can sell at once).
---
I have mixed hopes with this game, whilst I can't wait for another instalment of eldar scrolls I'm dubious on how Bethesda can f#$k it up somehow.
---
Were you wearing power armor?
---
It's not "reddit". What we call it doesn't matter.
---
It's a space with other humans. Like the op, and you, and me.
---
If we throw up on it, it'll be smelly. 
---
If we treat each other with respect, it'll be nice. 
---
Let's make it nice. 
---
I'll throw you this little role playing dilemma. 
---
You are one in a long line of people, who arrive at two, and only two doors. 
---
Down the door to the left, 19 of every 20 people who enter are put to death. Each 20th comes out the other end and is showered with praise. 
---
Down the other door, only one in 20 gets put to death. But those who come out the other end have to spend several years in an extremely unpleasant prison. 
---
Which door would you pick?
---
Yes
---
You are just as bad as the people you are whining about. Garbage person.
---
Sounds like a combination of exploits and server lag. 
---
I could do some math for you, but i don't want to, so i will just say that 150 writen damage weapon will oneshot anyone from sneak attack.
---
He had bounty from destroying that camp, you were near so you could do something. It sux that in mostly Co-op game are assholes who destroys your house, but same do flying bats and other ugly muties. And for Camp owner i would tell only that he could change server to save his junk that he needs now to repair camp. 
---
The problem with the game is that it is good in theory but the content gets boring and repetitive really quickly, just feels like a worse Destiny. Also, I couldn't open the game for the entire VIP Demo and they never answered me why and I had to refund it. (Luckily I was able to try it on my brother's pc).
---
This event doesn't appear just because you are in the area by the dirt track/fairgrounds. It will always be showing on the main map if it's possible.
---
When you get close to the spot AND it's already on your big map, then it will enroll you and throw your quest instructions up in the top right, but as I said, it already had to be on your map for it to do this.
---
I had recently rolled a new toon, we went and took the Track workshop, then went about our business. When it finally was on the main map, fast traveled to the Track and ran up\[ the driveway to get the thing going. It's nice to have the workshop as a fast travel point while waiting for this to pop :)
---
Multiple 10-20 level legendaries, not great for later on but if I ever roll a new toon again, this will be my first target to get early legendaries going.
---
Have you seen Fallout 4 New Vegas? Is an upcoming mod and it's amazing.
---
I was wondering about that
---
I wanted pink power armor. It’s a bummer they only released an armor skin for metal armor. 
---
FYI, not everyone plays like you. 
---
I bought the Skyrim PSVR addition awhile back. It's a real trip!
---
nope
---
even if you ignore everything else, for a ranged weapon you're looking at 1/23 * 1/7 * 1/9 for the legendary modifiers alone
---
this for getting a specific roll of course (god roll).
---
Do you have pain train equiped?
---
Guilty of that but with leather, I kind of feel bad for all the junk I've sent into cyber oblivion cause I had to free up space.
---
I don’t understand why if you’ve bought it you wouldn’t at least play a little and see what you think. 
---
I haven’t had anything game breaking happen and I also play on PS4. I have had 2 crashes in almost 2 months of playing (I too work over 40/week, mostly play during weekends- I’m only 27 hrs in). I took about two weeks off around the last patch because I let this sub get to me, frankly. I dreaded picking back up because of how badly people were freaking out. I got back to it this weekend and I was really enjoying it- I found a new area with several locations and some lore. I do think it’s empty and I wish there were NPCs to help move the story along, but I am still having fun. :)
---
Do you have that mutation which do blast around you when something hits you?
---
I once killed myself beating my friend who have this mutation. 
---
Or having the Reactive Plates mod.
---
And they all share a hard daily cap sell limit, so after I think like 600 or 800 caps of stuff sold they all go to 0 caps available forcing you to buy anything to sell again.
---
Did someone say....( dons mistress garb as a male) MYSTERY!!?
---
You may have a nice bed, but my Racecar bed is placed beside am environmental CB Radio (HAM) so I WIN :)
---
Left door baby!  Live free or die.
---
Im perfectly okay with less replies from you developers. I can certainly understand how the playerbase is quite large. Lots and lots of opinions. Do this, do that. Times thounsands. Who could have time to respond to even small portion of it.
---
 I hope you have your own vision too, your own opinion on where to take the game, that changes are more crucial. Trust that. Sure it's your first online game so you might not know well, might make a lot of mistakes. But Fallout is your canvas, paint what you like.
---
I agree that everyone should play as they want, I don't mind silly or gaudy gear and equipment if they also cater for people like myself and want items fitting to the setting but they aren't 
---
 So on my level 33 Melee  character when i get one weight over the limit i should be able to still RUN but not SPRINT this is the normal way it should work. But i found that getting overencumbered first pounds makes me WALK instead!  After initially relogging SOMETIMES i could RUN again but when i depleted my AP BAR i  would WALK forever! On my sniper commando character who is over level 60 i don't have this problem, as long as i am  a bit overencumbered i can still RUN with him. I tried the keybinds that make you RUN or toggle walk and run but that did not help. UPDATE: So i solved the  problem by just unequipping my strength based perks and re-equipping them, it does not matter if it was weight based perks or not! 
---
You have to say it with the correct protectron voice: Live free or DIE.
---
Yeh sadly i expected that but its ok 
---
I was wondering if that was worth it hey i might look into that 
---
I do!  But that's cause I play stealth-offense-support.  Team Medic is literally a necessity when you play as a medic support.
---
**None of this** concerns people who design games.
---
**None of this** informs decisions of people who design games. 
---
Not the games you like, not the ones you dislike. It's just post-hoc opinion. 
---
I won't argue with you, because you can't be argued with. Your world view is impenetrable to any new ideas.
---
the ferry sank anyway
---
You already implied one has dropped with TSE in your statement and the odds of the last roll. If one has dropped with the first 2 stats already filled in then you are only looking at the last stat which is 1/(total number of last stat options). Your wording is incorrect. 
---
If you roll 3 dice and the first two dice rolled 6s what's the odds that the last one is a 6? 1/6. What's the odds of all 3 dice rolling a six without knowing any outcome? 1/(6*6*6)
---
Overseers camp stash is pretty small. I try to put stuff in the dead body just a few steps west of the vault 76 start point. Those who go right out of the vault get lucky
---
Fr, i got to lvl 54 without playing even half of the main missions and a handful of side missions. Its insane. We should be able to get near 15 on all specials
---
The point was that ire directed at developers is misplaced, not that they should be fired or something.
---
Bah, waste of a few perks for Lead Belly.  Just accept radiation as way of life and be done with it.
---
Dilute some Radaways and use those when needed.  You get tons of them anyways.
---
This is why I'm trying to stock up on disease cures for when player vending becomes a thing.  Lotsa diseases out there, lot of diseased baddies, fight the microscopic warfare with:
---
**Disease Cure**
---
Stops them little baddies while you kill them big baddies.
---
On a side note, I wish antibiotics gave you like a 75% disease resist that stacks with vegetable medley soup's 20% disease resist.  Those lil baddies don't deserve more than 5%.
---
Shit Here is Over Priced. Hahah 
---
I was just listening to that song.
---
im sorry im not good at articulation....how do you know if im a long time player etc 🙄
---
Or maybe-- get this-- I believe more in logical thinking rather than emotional thinking? Maybe, just *maybe*, I prefer to look at the industry as a whole, the status of the company, then use the two in order to determine a fair standard for them (I consider Fallout 4, a game I didn't personally enjoy that much, to be an acceptable release from them, but I wasn't happy with parts of it personally).
---
**Maybe** your "world views" are heavily flawed and wrong, and this isn't the kind of topic where world views really apply? We're talking about a product from a company and why it doesn't meet industry standards. Bethesda is *not* an indie company. They have no valid excuse to have released this product in this state.
---
But yeah, I can't accept new views. I'm just ignint, right? I'm super stubborn. Nevermind that I regularly talk to a transgender friend who's changed my views on that. It's almost like this topic isn't really a flexible one, and determined more by facts and common sense then emotions.
---
You won't argue with me because you have no argument. Your points are all based on "Think of the developers! :(", but unfortunately the fact is that nobody is personally attacking these specific developers, but the company as a whole, whom has no excuse to have released such a shoddy product.
---
Keep living in your bubble of denial. It's okay, it was only $60 (or more), dude. It wasn't that big of a loss.
---
well, yeah. duh. but now tell me what creature drops a guaranteed 3\* TSE.
---
the odds of getting a specific 3rd mod are 1 in 9 for ranged weapons, or 0.1. 10%. but it means nothing by itself because you'll always have to roll the other 2 as well. so I don't see what point you're trying to make here.
---
If you love Skyrim it's an awesome experience being that immersed in it.
---
On PC and I got to say, that about 25% of the high level players I encountered were Griefers, sadly.  (level 135 here).
---
They get bored and want to screw over people.  
---
I've never had the launch her crash. 
---
Ive scrapped a bunch of outfits and never learned any plans from it. I’ve heard scrapping the combat helmet does give the plans tho. I’ve also scrapped a bunch of crafted under armor that I can craft in hopes of learning the different modding options and nada. Only under armor plans I have were obtained from vendors doing daily cap runs. 
---
With people claiming they loose Items and the constant Disconnects i would guess Bethesda is not ready for another stash increase.
---
Over 100 hours in and still enjoying it, helps to play with friends big time.
---
I was pointing out your wording was inncorrect.
---
If you are on PC, I have nearly full level 50 suite I crafted because the super duper made extras for the 3 out of 5 parts. I could also craft the rest to make it full. When I was finally making the quest, I found it a bit funny to hear people had needed to farmed materials for it, while I could instantly craft the whole suite on the spot, and 60% of extra copy.
---
The only real reward immediately out of it you get, is the power armor station plans. It's not like those things aren't all over anyway.
---
Sure the game might treat some random plan drops differently after you have the quest done. Well probably it does, so you can get more excavator parts, but still, who knows if the game actually tracks building it, or if just getting a part will suffice. And you can craft cheaper I think if you craft level 25, intead of 45.
---
&gt;Used another miner map to get more black ore. Dig up the ore.
---
You should not dig those until you have the full suite, it give you lot of more. I don't remember if you can buy more of them, I think they are limited.
---
The Restroom Man, sounds as bad as The Cat Man who fills homes with pictures of kitties.

Cos I traded with you and we met here on Reddit LOL
---
[A rare siting](https://youtu.be/mWARiPoZo6Q) 
---
strange its always crashing for me im using the latest version
---
so you're just a grammar nazi? ok, thanks, I guess?
---
I won't argue because I'm not confident in my English as I am in my math, but I'm pretty sure my wording was fine. you can't calculate the 3rd mod in a vacuum, that's not how the game works.
---
so even if my wording was funky, you should assume that you have to consider the 1st and 2nd rolls as well, because why the hell wouldn't you?
---
lol ok you got me..hey can you give me an upvote? cos i can only reply to a post once every 10 minutes
---
&gt; already deinstalled  
---
yeah so go away please.
---
What this guy doesn't get is that he's the guy showering the praise at the survivors of the left door, and that the Fallout 76 team is the person faced with these doors.
---
And he's very, very angry that they didn't chose the path that leads to certain death for them. 
---
The problem with his view? He's a hypocrite. If it was his family business, he'd choose the same road.
---
So what percentage of TSE weaons are duped items. Maybe even unknowningly bought duped items. Should the weapon be rare? Because I swear every high level player I've met has a explosive weapon at the least if it's not a TSE.
---
It is concerning, and at this point I would be surprised if anything gets better.  Is sinking more time and money into FO76 even a profitable option for Bethesda? It's not like it would really increase sales at this point.
---
Bethesda is a company, they don't care about us, they never have and never will.  They only care about the community as far as it affects their profits.  So, if there's no more potential for profit to be gained from FO76, it's just going to get dumped no matter how many people are, or are not, working on it.
---
Yessir they can.
---
Can we have it done like this?:
---
&gt;I think legendary enemies should have a guaranteed legendary drop rate corresponding to their legendary level, so 2* drops 2 level 1 legendaries or 1 level 2 legendary; 3* drops 3 level 1's or 1 level 1 and 1 level 2 or 1 level 3
---
Maybe not on government worker bots in watoga or feral ghouls in a nonnuked Whitesprings, but everywhere else?  I just say those 2 because they've already been kindly areas for legendary hunting.
---
Yup. Might even turn off pacifist not really sure. I know that my electrically charged mutation has initiated PvP. 
---
I'll consider it if you give me a real answer as to why you posted as if you were new? I can't figure out the benefit whether you love or hate the game!
---
The sulfur water fountain in the ring around the stone dome (gazebo) at White Springs cures diseases when you drink from it. It's near the tennis courts. 
---
&gt;Also trying to cater to hardcore fallout fans and fortnite players at the same time with wacky outfits and b.s. instead of some good looking armor or raider gear.
---
Those wacky armor pieces you refer are quite inspired by one Nuka World raider group. 
---
So you can go complain about it into Fortnite reddit how they made Fortnite to cater Fallout 4 Nuka world fans.
---
Outfits are an expression of personalization and personality. You like grungy fallout style outfits and there are plenty of those in game already. The silly ones would be out of character to come by in the game world. Plus it’s not like most of you would even pay for grungy outfits and armor skins anyway lol let us silly willies use our atom points to spice up our gameplay and break the monotony. With your logic they might as well get rid of all camp skin options and only leave basic wood and rusted warehouse 
---
thought so, i knew about electrically charged, tesla coils has caused problems with non hostile mobs too but since reactive plates are a bit different i wasnt entirely sure
---
well i guess i’ll have to watch out
---
Nope what they mean is your friend is scamming you. I am just clarifying what that person meant I don’t have an opinion either way.
---
Now you're throwing insults. You could have just said "ohh yeah I can see how the wording could have caused confusion". In statistics wording is more important that the numbers themselves.  
---
i didnt think before i posted..wasnt trying to come across as new..my toy box did go missing..i have been playing fallout series for many years but im still nowhere near as knowledgeable as a lot of other players..and sometimes i ask stupid questions...btw i love fallout..iv been playing games since commodore 64 and fallout is the best game iv ever played..even with its faults. 
---
Bye Felicia. Good riddance. 
---
I had assumed when i bought a used copy that I would get an installation disk etc... basically a working copy of the game. Like how I would usually get used games. I was not trying to buy a code...which did not work.  
---
Even looking back at the advertisement...it say Fallout 76 game... not game code. But if you are going to send me a code instead of another means of installing the game at least grt me one that works.  
---
&gt;However, I really want them to fix the game first.
---
Your point is actually absolutely valid, but people tend to forget that...ITS NOT JUST ONE PERSON!  
---
They have peops doing art and design, they have coders and QA for fixing and creating stuff....  
---
Making designs and make them accessible ingame via shop is not that much of coding actually you would think with a shop in place its actually more like a warehouse solution/content management thing that is totally distinct from the process of QA/Dev.  
---
So while I get what you say its not a reasonable thing to say. It should be more like "Hey I wish they would finally create stuff that people crave for (more color schemes like on NEXUS mod pages found), so they get the money to pay the guys who fix the game"...coz this is how a company works and thrives on a gamesystem like this. F2P has to rely on ingame shop and people declaring that this is not the case are absolutely oblivious to how maintaining your wallet (companywise) is done.
---
Hey, you using the button to proc it? You

 know, the same one you use for ammo, chems, food, every other perk that requires you to search the container? Havent had any problems with cap stashes yet...

---
The heart is not limited. It’s discounted for limited time. That pose is old and just bundled in for Valentine’s Day. 
---
...maybe the game sucks so much, that only 6% bothered actually playing after they are done with quest?... but generally, yes I would agree. I mean even after they added slap damage, no penalty on death, camp repairing cost close to nothing, option to jump server- still people are having hard time and complaining for getting "bullied". But hey it is not like they need to do dungeons and raids. Like playerbase told:"After you are done with quests, there are so many places to explore and to chill", so what stops them keep chilling, not the dungeons and raids. 
---
And the thing is if dungeons and raids are too hard for current playerbase, then that only shows that Beth has focused on wrong audience. 
---
Do you believe in data, statistics and the scientific method?
---
OK have an upvote
---
I also have been gaming since the 80s on my trusty old C64
---
God Wasteland was such a great game for its day!
---
Dumb question, but do you remember Impossible Mission? With all the robots? "Stay awhile, stay FOREVER!"
---
Open a Bethesda support ticket. They have record of all purchases, and they surely can check your account and see the ToyBox isn't there, which has no explanation considering they have record of the Atom Shop buy. Worth a shot, please report back!
---
Wait up.  Are you saying this game will be ready to play in 2021?  Oh goddamn it...
---
haha, no, if DLC comes, it wont come for year or two.
---
High Schools.....Watoga High, Morgantown High...Think those are the only two, but if there are more high schools, then those too.
---
Watoga high school. Just from the cafeteria I can get around 120 plastic per run.
---
morgantown highschool has a ton of plastic pumpkins, i once got 70 on a single run through the building
---
Good screen name🙂
---
I bought the pink pipboy skin, with a quickness. I got on the challenge grind for that shit; no regrets. 
---
and if you do have pacifist mode on and they do hit you and keep hitting you it will kill them and make you wanted for some weird reason
---
The Cat Lady House/Farm just west of Morgantown. 
---
You can learn Armor mods from scrapping armor parts, but you cannot learn Power Armor mods from scrapping Power Armor parts.
---
I never really farmed materials much like that. I always just took workshops and just fast travel around between them and my stash of Junk was always pretty well stocked up. But there are a lot of cups lying around on the ground at fairgrounds.
---
No. I'm saying this game doesn't have a concept of "ready" at all. It never will. 
---
It's not this:
---
1. Designers design. 
---
2. Developers build. 
---
3. Testers test. 
---
4. Marketers market. 
---
5. Product ships. 
---
6. Users use. 
---
-that's it-. 
---
It's this:
---
1. Designers do a minimal viable (and very immature) something.
---
2. Developers build it.
---
3. Users use it.
---
4. Users ask for new things. Initially it'll be "fix bug X, or do feature Y", but in time it'll be a "Add game mode Z" or "Add content in the shape of W". 
---
5. Go back to step 1. Repeat forever. 
---
The iterative model doesn't have a magical point at which the product is ready. It continues to evolve post launch. And what it'll be in 2021 nobody knows, not in BGS, not in the community. It all depends on the dialogue between the playerbase and the studio. 
---
Raider Armor *Plans* spawn there?
---
Not sure I understand correctly, but what you're saying sounds wrong. Each faction has a cap pool of 200, and there are 7 factions - Responders, raiders, whitesprings, enclave, BoS, free states, and Watoga station/Grahm. You can sell up to 200 caps worth of stuff to them every 20 hours, not including buying things from them to increase their caps back up. So if you clear out all vendors, thats 1400 caps, minus travel costs, that you can make every day.
---
Why the hate?  Buying a used product is not some kind of scheme to cheat the system.  It is not like I am getting a bootleg copy from a back alley.  
---
You don't expect a used car to perform like a brand new one, but you are protected by law to a least get one that runs and is in fact a car. 
---
Are you sure you \*crafted\* the whole set on your first character? Or maybe you just found all the pieces in the world and assembled a set? The plans for Raider Power Armor are \*so rare\* I doubt you'd be able to craft a full set of it without knowing how you got the plans for the parts.
---
You are correct. I was thinking Power Armor but didn't specify it.
---
well, you are kinda acting like one. my wording doesn't matter at all, especially considering it's obvious you have to calculate the 1st and 2nd rolls.
---
like I said, I don't really care either way so long my point is still valid. which I believe it is.
---
You've turned this idea on it's head.  And now, most likely I won't be able to get any sleep.  If this was your plan all along then let me just say "Kudos.  And to hell with you!"
---
GtaV became all about shark cards towards the end and red dead 2 got boring and online just sucks
---
thnx..i dont remember those games..my fave game back then was sid meiers civilization..i remember games like rolling thunder..rampage..california games..yeh..my toy box did go missing..but i was in a teamates camp when i tried to put it down..then the next day when i was at my own camp i was able to place it.   i have placed it in workshops i have owned..but maybe not allowed to place it in teamates camp? .now that i think about it makes sense. theyd want other people to purchase it instead of friends giving them one.
---
this guy knows whats up listen to him
---
In most cases, but with power armor it only gives you the scrap. And so far black powder weapons have not given any upgrades. will scrap some more just to be sure. I believe I have scrapped about 6 BP rifles so far.
---
&gt; Well, I think that’s a different problem- the only people pursuing the out-of-game markets are people who are primarily looking for top tier gear. 
---
Yeah, people also need to buy. I've brought several TS way before nerf made them nearly obsolete. I've brought medicore 2 star and 3 star armors. Continue to doing the latter, but I can't pay 3k for something that isn't highly sought after. Nearly everything I buy, I can convinently sell it later for maybe 10%-30% price.
---
I've watch several times how suddently there's fairly large amount of players wanting to buy a very spesific assassin+sentinel gear(I mean like marine left leg, that's it, nothing more they need) and they got lots and lots of other really god tier armor and all sorts of others they can trade.
---
People don't buy, people don't sell. One doesn't exists without another. The player market is very limited, only a small amount of playerbase participates in it. And then they spam the adds of mostly wanting very similiar stuff. It somewhat works, but it's rather tedious.
---
There is no horde of low level casuals waiting to buy stuff.
---
Player vending would/will be great. How great depends. Over and over I've tried selling like stims for 2-3 caps a piece. Every time I've managed to sell some, I've been happy, but the caps you can get, versus the effort you are taking, does not really satisfy. Vending should make some stuff like this to liquidate much easier. Hopefully some people would realize also sell low demand ammo that way. There is huge disparity in ammo and weapons and their prices, which is because some many are so hard bent on having only the best gear.
---
I mean sure, everyone just have to accept and deal with it. But I think it's fair to dislike it.
---
Why? Seriously why? So you can collect a larger amount of bad stuff? That won’t fix the problem, just delay it another week.
---
Also golf balls at Whitespring.
---
160 here, with second character around level 60, also on PC. Ive never encountered a single griefer, and I run with all kinds of people, up to level 330. 
---
I met a level 20 yesterday, hiding outside the nuke zone at white springs. I gave him a hazmat suit, held his hand, and escorted him around, then helped him with upgrades and quests. Now he plays on our discord. 
---
OP is spot on. I'd say the vast majority of us keep it fresh by helping lowbies.

#PipBoy
---
Issue: Entering the pip-boy right after logging makes you unable to do anything but relog. (Ticket Submitted on 02-12-2019)
---
Reported more by console users than PC, but still an issue there.
---
Entering the Pip-Boy immediately after getting in world can lock the player out of being able to perform any activities until you re-log. (Reported by z3rosun)
---
Fix:
---
Unknown
---
--------
---
A possible temporary fix is to simply wait for a minute or two, this is caused (I suspect by) by the item menus not being fully loaded (like prepatch stash box menus not syncing with workbenches upon first logging in), just like how workbenches couldn't function and craft because of that, the pipboy can't display due to still loading up it's inventory.
---
Problem is I *think* the infinite load issue hits it sometimes so this glitch can last indefinitely forcing a relog.
---
#V.A.T.S.
---
Issue: V.A.T.S not working properly for energy weapons and legendary 2 shots weapons. (Ticket Submitted on 02-12-2019)
---
V.A.T.S not working properly for energy weapons and legendary 2 shots weapons
---
Displaying 95% hit chance while actually hitting 1 time out of 4); same issue was happening in Fallout 4 with "low speed projectile weapons" such as plasma rifle, so it is probably related to the mechanics of the V.A.T.S itself unable to properly works in real time. . (Reported by z3rosun)
---
​**CONFIRMED**
---
Alongside this, at close range beam weapons clip right through enemies leaving them unharmed.  Using Vats at close range is essentially an AP waste.
---
#Vendor Trade Interaction
---
Issue: Vendors show "0" Caps when they have 200. (Ticket Submitted on 02-12-2019)
---
Vendors will report Zero caps, and the only way to get the actual number is to try and sell one or more items.
---
This likely leads players to think the Vendors are not refreshing, and is resulting in ongoing frustration.
---
Possible temporary fix to test this could be buying one round of ammo from them to see if their displays are glitched?  Or a cheap aid item?  This is upsetting only because I'm constantly looking to sell excess stuff and after about 600 or 800 caps every vendor has 0 caps to sell, I'll see if it's a daily trade limit or if it's this issue.  If it is this issue, then **T H A N K. Y O U.**, I just wanna sell some decent stuff, not drop it :c
---
EA or BioWare? 
---
I was doing a 30 min spring, screw, gear farming run for about two weeks then realised I'm not going to need 700 of each. Now I drop 50 of each for lower ranked players, just doesn't seem right trading them or selling them. 
---
Man the alien blaster looks and sounds great but it hits as hard as an unborn child.it would be sweet to hang it on the wall but instead it's main function so far is using it to shoot cats.
---
Meh
---
F o 7 6 I w i l l a s k n i c e l y n o t
---
The problem is the entire perk system is fucked.  Doing this would solve the problem of having to choose between combat not being tedious or everything else being tedious but that is just one problem.  There are still other problems.
---
Certain perk combos are impossible as the max a stat can be is 15 yet perks are tied to stats so certain combos would require more than 15.  I have one character I'd love to put some more points in strength for some really useful perks but since I already maxed it I'm forced to downgrade perks to make more room.  Meanwhile I have perks I don't really want in agility just because I have the points.  There's too many builds that just do not work because the perks you need are all in the same stat.  This then leads to the next problem of there being too many useless perks, perks that would only be good if you hadn't finished your build yet and happened to get it in a perk pack so you slot it in just because you need to fill room.  Then there are perks that are way too good.  Using 9 points for 60% damage is huge diminishing returns from 3 points at 30% but that extra 30% might as well be necessary.  There is a serious problem with bullet spongy enemies caused by the way the DR system works.  This means you're really not getting diminishing returns because the difference in damage is so damn huge.  This also causes perks that offer armor penetration necessary.  Then you need perks for crafting which means every character I make is going to need at least 5 perks in intelligence for gunsmith and/or makeshift warrior.  It would be cool to have players specialize in crafting but currently the only way to do that is to hand over your most prized weapons and armor to some random guy and hope he doesn't rip you off.
---
The big overall issue is there aren't enough perks that change the way you play, just perks that help you play.  Combat perks are necessary as so much of the game is combat and it is a totally unenjoyable slog unless you have a max efficiency build.  Weight reduction perks are necessary as no matter what you do you're going to be carrying tons of shit so you need at least some unless you want inventory management to be even more hell than it already is.  It doesn't apply to your stash though so good luck storing all that stuff you're carrying as it won't fit as it's 10 times heavier in the stash so have fun carrying it forever.  There are perks that barely do anything like +5 to your basket weaving skill as if that will affect absolutely anything.
---
Right now, if you want to create a build, you choose a playstyle.  You have your choice of weapon: melee, shotgun, heavy weapon, rifle, pistol, etc. then you have a choice if you also want to use explosives and/or vats.  Nothing else matters.  Every choice of perk after that is just helping you play that playstyle.  There's no real big substantial differences that perks offer besides letting you be effective with that choice of weapon.  The only big gameplay effecting perks are the ones that affect mutations as mutations themselves are substantial.  There are also some interesting charisma perks but the rest give you useless bonuses when reviving your teammates (because why would you want to die?) but charisma requires you play in a group anyway so you're limited to that playing in groups if you want to use that playstyle.  The rest of the perks just add a little bit of flavor but since you're already strapped for perk slots you're probably never going to use any of them.  Stimpaks generating edible meat tissue because of mutation and exposure to radiation?  That sounds pretty wacky and interesting.  Too bad I'll never use it because for 3 perk points I can choose to situationally get slightly more food or I can choose to get 45% explosive and fire resistance, 20% more damage, negate limb damage, pick any lock, hack any terminal, be more accurate, weapons weigh ten times less, chems weigh ten times less, food weighs ten times less, etc. etc.  The choice of perks just fucking sucks and making different builds isn't much fun.
---
Man, I've spent way too long writing this.
---
Your camp looks like a robot pooping
---
I had the same conundrum with Furious vs. Executioners Combat Stotgun.  I ended up keeping furious.  I now have the same exact with 10mm SMG's.  I think both are good, just depends on the enemy and your build.
---
Highschools and amusement parks
---
Just stop playing lmao 
---
There is. Just not released. I have a paladin paint job 🤭

*Degenerates*
---
Want to level up fast while getting plans for CAMP building? Capture workshops everytime you login. I capture 5 workshops each time, I don't build anything because DC is a bitch, I just capture and defend workshops for fast EXP and plans. Be wary of PvPers though.
---
Nonsense theory.
---
They don't have any servers, they use AWS.
---
While the engine not working well with multiplayer is a given, the truth is that modern gaming online is usually done through Virtual Servers and a kit named Amazon Web Services. The olden days of a company having some brick and mortar servers in a dank room with lots of fans and bundles of wires is long gone!
---
Nowadays, a massive server in a datacenter is running virtual machines, probably many virtual machines or VMs on the one superserver in a big warehouse that is nothing but giant cages with many different companies stuff running on them, locked behind gates and cabinets, with staff at the front door of said warehouse who can guide you to your companies' cabinet.
---
Repurposed server eqipment are definitely not the problem! It is more likely that Bethesda don't have a skilled group of AWS developers yet, a skillset that all major tech companies are desperate for in 2019
---
Why didn't they apply their patch on their latest version instead?
---
Losing tons of money kinda does that.
---
I was trying to kill SB with TSE yesterday, for every shot, SB heals around 50% damage made. Don't know is it bug or server lag though
---
Bethesda, Bethesda never changes.
---
I use the power of atom to heal nearly all rads. (endurance perk that heals them in sunlght) I have both levels I can choose depending on other combinations.
---
Don't even have streched genes normally active. I hate that radaway shit because it makes you sick. I do occasinally have to use it though.
---
I mean a big, well known game like Diablo 3 literally had learned these mistakes FOR Bethesda and they just go ahead and make them anyway. It just speaks to how painfully lazy some of the design decisions were. 
---
Wow! That's so much more than Fort Defiance, thanks! 😀
---
Good exp grind doing the monster mash if you’re kinda low levelled too. Great place to also farm adhesive, gold, silver, springs and screws from the ghouls, as well as tons of chems and meds.
---
Haha, yeah, who's isn't dammit?
---
The pool balls on the pool tables in the golf club too.
---
Nope, that's your cynicism (either joking or serious; I can't tell through the text). 
---
The game is ready to play now. 
---
I'm saying there'll be fewer bugs to do with core stuff. 2 months in, there already is fewer bugs to do with core stuff.  
---
I'm saying by 2021 it will have evolved thanks to there being developers post-launch, and thanks to the fact we're all informing the designers and contributing to steering it.
---
This is a really limited view on things. The game is approaching 4 months now and players have acquired a lot of stuff and/or working towards new builds, or trying to experiment with stuff. And that is all even without trying to collect stuff.
---
For instance i'm running a vanguard build right now but working towards a bloodied unyielding build. So i'm stashing all those amor bits and they add up. Also i'm saving some bloodied weapons, a few of them because atm i can't really determine what i'll prefer later.
---
Then i have 3 full sets of PA and various cores which i'd LIKE to stash.
---
And that is all even not accounting loot that is not suitable for builds, like awesome melee weapons when running a rifle build. There simply is no room to stash these 'nice to haves' which eventually makes you have to go with one build (one a single char) and forget everything else.
---
Isnt BGS Austin the current company working on F76 and not marryland?
---
I respect that, for me it's the opposite (took a two week break from fallout for my first RDR2 playthrough and another week for it's beta online).  I played RDR2 story mode and it was one of the best along side RDR, however after a week of playing the garbage online (garbage in comparison to story mode and way more server issues and lack of content than fallout 76 which blew me away) I went back to Fallout 76 with a fresh new breath:)
---
Ouch, the springs!
---
Thank you for saying!!!!!! 
---
Maybe a good tip. I hang around Watoga all the time. But I haven't really bothered to go recheck it, since it takes few mins to get up there. 
---
After all Im all fine on stims, normally I use diluted anyway and sell extra stims when I can. But I could always sell more.
---
***I just got done running site Charlie and after only 3 minutes at my nuke zone... discoed. After spending so much time on a nuke run. On a quiet night with no other nukes on the server, not much going on, why do I get disconnected? That's all we want to really know. Why do we keep doing this ? Please, please tell us why we keep getting discoed. We have GREAT computers. I built mine just for this game. PLease. Please. Tell us why.

Why'd you 'deinstall' it? Don't mean this in a bad way but if you look online for improvement and keep involved with the community why not keep it installed for when the time/patch/dlc content comes? 
---
Also really curious what you installed in it's place haha (rdr2?)
---
I recently forced myself to be more ruthless with what I keep hold of. If you aren't using certain weapons, ammo, armor, junk, aid or whatever it is in every session then do you really need it?  I stick to 3 rifles and the ammo that goes with them, all other ammo I pickup goes in a suitcase at a vendor or to one of my team mates. There is also no need to have too much of a resource like black titanium, you can easily get more if you ever need it.
---
I'd prefer if they make the stash shared between your characters.  People make mules anyway, and this wouldn't increase server load at all.
---
I made similiar thing on the nuclear disposal site. Above the glowing pit. Stairs after stairs, until I can't get higher, then a large platform, few holes in it, lots of mats all over, some piles of stackable things as much as I could.
---
Don't have any good screenshots, but I though it's semi-funny if/when someone finds that. I did have few turrets and one or two open collectors there too. 
---
Shame it's so away from all the action that probably few go there.
---
Maybe i had Dysentery &amp; Parasites, but i guess the thing that killed me was a hole on my chest of the size of two scorchbeast blast attack.
---
I would suggest finding and using a build planner for your perk cards as you level up...I was picking perk cards randomly and by the time I was level 50 I specialized in anything and had a real hard time killing things.  
---
Level 300 here. It gets no better.
---
I have a two shot explosive Gatling gun and I had same experience as you however recently I’d been trying run down rarely used ammo. After some time using it, it’s a great gun. Sure it has its pros and cons but you just need to find your groove with it. I’d say keep it
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
Have you ever been addicted to chems?  In about 160hrs I've only been addicted once 😂
---
I always need more springs &amp; screws in my stash, but 12 Luck, 'Luck Of The Draw' &amp; 'Lucky Break' help to offset that.
---
Serverhopped at the vendor in harpers ferry to buy the mods before plans were available- app 250 caps a pcs for calibrated shocks... fairly easy... and always on my route for unloading items for caps... always buy the mods when I find them... plenty of buyers at 4-500 caps...
---
I use an instigating bolt action pipe rifle with faster critical meter recharge, 9 cards in rifleman, 9 cards in pistol, 3 cards in GunFu, 3 cards in Nerd Rage combine with adrenal reaction mutation. One-shot almost anything include level 68 supermutants without using critical. 
---
Stabilized level 36 perk in Intelligence gives heavy weapons while in PA better accuracy.
---
Rarely use chems, but the radaway &amp; rad - x along with mentants etc make good vendor trash.
---
had a random guy fast travel to me and he gave me 30 stimpacks then fast traveled away
---
Chaotic good. 
---
Sweet, thanks!! I haven't down that quest yet. 
---
&gt; This will guarantee no issue.
---
Duh, that's no sollution. You don't need 100 of everything while you certainly need larger amounts of some things.
---
Stop doing Edits. It's embarrassing. 
---
&gt; I will always play them with the hopes they evolve. 
---
Ok you're a complete cuck.
---
Is that it? Damn..
---
I've seen a level 926 or so, about month+ ago. Sure he used a script and xp glitch to get that, but it was funny still.
---
so there are two cannibal raider tribes called the gourmands?
---
I wouldn’t hold your breath, they have nothing.... donuts. Except for the PvP thing and a few vaults. 
---
&gt; &gt; We have passed this on to the team.
---
Jason Bright is a glowing one, and is sentient and fully verbose.
---
This guy knows whats'up. Why bother with perk cards when you have a magic water supply that cures diseases litteraly in the middle of the best farming spot ?
---
True.. I was that short hunting rifle... And u ruined my life! I used to be his favorite gun but u ruined me! Aaaaaaaaa i will destroy youuuuuu fuuuuuuuuuu
---
Saw the same "merchant" once, killed him, then died laughing :)
---
He’s a “garbage person” for helping out ladies and the elderly, and criticizing those who would make their lives worse?   Y’all are pathetic examples of quasi-humanity.  
---
Stash space and the stutter. Only things I really want fixed.
---
Otherwise I'm still enjoying the game.
---
Wait, it’s a heavy weapon? Now things make sense. (And it’s weight) 
---
Yeah definately trade it for something real, than caps.
---
I had about 500/500 of springs and screws, when I got a TSE rad rifle.
---
I still got about 500 of the other,  can't remember which, about 100 of the other. But Im all of out adrehesive and steel, from unlocking the mods for it. Hmm I think I burned quite some srews just prior to excavator armor, so I would have lots of springs.
---
I've been prior fairly wasteful with adrehesive, like repaired weapons when they were about 70%-80% health(mind you dropped down from 200%, not 100%), and I haven't needed lots.
---
1000 units is nothing.
---
u/spectral000 \- thanks for the response. 
---
The op wasn't about which specific issues you guys are tackling.
---
I think that despite cynicism there's actually a mounting level of community confidence in you guys doing what's right by the entire family, and having your priorities straight, particularly when it comes to dealing with systemic priorities (like duping) as opposed to just doing what's popular or nice. Just an opinion. I might stir up disagreement with that, but that's not the point.  
---
The op was about making the communication coming our way more transparent.   
---
I'll say it in my own words, and the OP will forgive me if I misstate his views:  
---
We like what you've done, involving us in the design like that.   
---
We want more. We want to know more about your views.   
---
We want to actually head your opinions about X and Y, about why one thing is wrong and another is right.   
---
We feel you see and know things we know, and we \*\*want\*\* to understand it the way you guys do, but we can't if you don't share more.   
---
The issues and feedback thread, with per-item responses about what people have raised, is an excellent start.
---
I'd love to see not only break-fix stuff on there, but how you feel about small tactical and big holistic suggestions.   
---
\*\*Help us make our feedback more informed feedback.\*\*, do better at sharing the vision.   
---
And maybe community design is more about honesty and transparency, than wooing us with what you've cooked up as a surprise. 
---
I use chems like they're going out of style, and I've only been addicted a few times. I generally have more than enough addictol.
---
Im a no mic player too. But sadly only lvl 29.I suppose  I'd be classed as casual.  If you see me in game come say hi. Look for the clueless bloke called Bincat 237🙂
---
Excellent, I'll just have to make sure I pick a place that I'll want to stay.
---
you all have to imagine sam kinison here.  :-)
---
What would happen if I log in and it says that someone is in that spot and I DON'T rebuild, on second login would it still be there so long as I didn't rebuild?
---
they will be approved..........eventually
---
When i first picked up the game i was immediately hit with not being able to build over 3 floors (or is it 4?) 
---
Are you saying theres some magical way around this? i would LOVE to take another stab at a look out tower. 
---
I wish you the best of luck on your vending, but I found that even one level of Pharma Farma keeps me on more cures than I could ever use. I just drop the excess at stations. 
---
The 3D GTA's never cared about the PC.
---
This just happened to me tonight, but with 549. Fortunately I don't normally use fusion cells, so I'm not too upset about it.
---
It's a heavy gun. But works for the pistol achievement. And I think martial artist increases its speed.
---
Fairly early on in my play through I got an explosive vampires gatling gun and it was my go to weapon for so long. Still kinda is sometimes. Depending on scenario.
---
With max bandolier the ammo weighs nothing. And with I think strong arms. The gun ends up weighing 2lbs 
---
Next time, i make you into a toaster and send you to Nevada. How would you like that?!
---
&gt;the "best and brightest chosen for vault 76 " are such assholes. 
---
&gt;A vault opened the same year... Vault 76, one of the first vaults to open. The vault appears to have been another sick and twisted Vault-Tec experiment, filled with psychopaths and murderers. The worst humanity had to offer. The vault dwellers, upon exiting the vault, immediately went on a rampage. There is no evidence of human survivors in the region, the vault dwellers killed everyone. Including, apparently, Taggerdy's team. The dwellers seem to have had prior knowledge of Enclave bunkers and nuclear missile silos in the region, and went straight for them. We suspect this was all planned before the war. The destruction of the entire war repeated and concentrated. Local survivors that were not killed directly by the vault dwellers were killed when the nukes fell. The dwellers dropped thousands of bombs all over Appalachia. We cannot fathom why."

---
&gt;IF you are a stealth build these two armors are your friend, because both of them you can get to 0 weight which means you take none of the penalties for having armor as that is based on armor weight.
---
I think most armor can get 0 weight. Remember some armor is "heavy" so they won't be it. I have about 10-15 weightless armor pieces and maybe only 3-4 of them have any weight.
---
&gt;Unless you have the current rad worm bug which makes it so they know you are there the moment you enter the cell and try to snipe you... I hate that bug.
---
I haven't noticed it making me bad at stealth. There is aparently another bug that will display "warning" even when enemies haven't detected you, maybe because some invisible friendly ghost is following you.
---
I would like that! Because then others would use me more! And i could be pretty good toaster so yeah... What u gonna do now? 
---
Alright i may still add u and we can do events in lower level areas like ash heap is about ur level
---
I’ve had the combat shotgun plan drop a couple of times in Blackwater mine. On the crate to the left of the workbench before you get into the uranium fever area. Sometimes it’s glitches into the crate a bit so can be tough to spot. Hope that helps. 
---
Cool man. Like I say Im more or less casual. Just dont get much time to play really. 
---
&gt;sure it's nice but what are the odds of getting a FULL set of weightless marine armor...
---
Over time fairly good actually. If you only got for that, it's one star. And because they are lightweight, you can carry all you want.
---
I assure you no one is duping one stars.
---
Alright. It varies for me, some days im busy as shit some days i can play all day if i wanted
---
&gt; Would Bethesda ban me for having more than a certain number? 
---
If that certain number was 1,000,000 -- probably.
---
If it was 10?  No way.
---
Post up a want to buy ad in the trade subs. I’m sure someone will come along wanting to sell them to you. 
---
I know, I have seen videos of people just destroying the enemy with switch blades or death gauntlets. Doesn't change the fact I hate that style of play and shouldn't be forced into it which the nerfs are doing.  
---
That throne room scene looks nice on first sight but when you look really close and slow it down a little you see how bad it is actually made
---
What about 100?
---
I apologize, I misunderstood your original comment. 
---
I agree with you it's managements fault not the developers. In my experience developers will tend to push the release date back for quality reasons, while management will plan to put a release date up for money reasons.
---
You will have more luck at /r/fo76bazaar
---
It looks nice on first sight and every sight that follows.
---
&gt; oh yeah 1* will be fine.. if this is true (and i do believe you) is this also true for unyielding gear?
---
Yes unyielding is also one star so it's fairly trivial to come by. Unlike weightless though, there is a price involved in keeping it without using, so most players would't even try to sell them.(the price/cost of weight).
---
You can also buy one star weightless from vendors with good probability, most people won't try to stockpile them as even without much "cost of ownership", they aren't really valuable, so they won't bother. But they do bother to pick one up when they found one, and sell it on vendor.
---
600lb is probably ok for a single toon imo. My problem seems to be having a full 600lb inventory of components with very little to build at CAMP, particularly interior items. I can't remember the last time I found a plan I didn't already own yet there's loads of plans I don't have.
---
I'd like to see a more reasonable way of unlocking plans that didn't involve events. I'm only really interested in exploring.

I would use deep pocketed for weightless armor you use, and light/ultralight for something you just have stashed.
---
Bethesda CAN'T talk to you because if they do, it will become apparent that Bethesda as a whole is unwilling to put more resources into this project (for reasons I don't think I have to go into). By maintaining some level of goodwill PR they can say the game is doing well and they are listening/communicating with the community without having to admit that there will be major commitments to improving this games' situation.
---
Just to get it out there, I don't play FO76. I don't want to play FO76. I love some of Bethesda's previous releases but I wouldn't touch this one even if a German outlet gave it to me for free.
---
The community team is just that, a community team. They will often read what is going on but they cannot promise anything, nor can they reveal anything since they (most likely) don't even know themselves. Imagine being in their shoes. Executives asking for increased monetization from the atom shop but having the feature exposed by the community before it even goes live. Patches reverting previous fixes. The already bad PR from all the other glaring issues surrounding FO76 would make them (and any developer) downright SCARED. 
---
Bethesda at this point should want nothing more than this bad dream to disappear - there is no ill will on their part and to some extent I'm sure they understand the gamers who are frustrated, who want to believe etc. Try to understand that for them, that the faster FO76 disappears from the media as a stigma of Bethesda as a awful developer, the better.
---
Daily apologies, groveling, bonus XP, bonus caps, cap stash respawn rate increased 500%. Oh wait. Here buy some pink stuff in the atom store instead.
---
If random high level players show up and try to get your attention look for a paper bag odds are they just want to do their good deed for the day
---
I just need a few hundred more aswell cause i just got better loot that i cant even store, and i have to carry it on me and guess who lost 20 gears,screws and a few dozen aluminum scrap when dying? This guy (i know that amount is nothing to you guys but its a huge deal for me)
---
You spent 80,000 on Stealth boys in a game with a caps limit of 25,000?
---

---
Hmmm.... toasty buns? 
---
And you were expecting this to change my mind? Incorrect. He played that scene quite a lot, it looked great at every sight.
---
Good analysis. But I watch movies at the speed that provided to me. I dont care about critically accurate nonsense like this. Throne room scene still reigns supreme!
---
Your words are garbage!
---
&gt;  There are journal pages scattered around though.
---
And they tell quite an interesting, sad (of course!) story.
---
No I’m asking if I had 100 mk3 stealthboys on me would that trigger anything
---
&gt;You~~r words~~ are garbage!
---
There are currently close to 0 reasons to team up with another player unless you know the person already, the multiplayer aspect needs to be improved for it to be worthwhile, i'll list a few reasons below:  
---
1. exp isnt shared unless you tag the same monster\*
---
2. loot isnt shared unless you tag the same monster\*\*
---
3. there are no real benefits except for a few perks (Strange in numbers is awesome, for example)
---
4. the only means of communication is the ingame voice chat and emote wheel, the latter being too underwhelming to communicate with when it comes to anything but "Hello" and "come here" and "thumbs up".
---
if 1 and 2 was solved by making it team loot/exp, there would be alot more reasons to team up with another player to benefit from the multiplayer experience, as it is now you are pretty much better off playing solo so you can kill the mobs at your own pace and get more loot overall. 
---
Just to point it out aswell, this game desperately needs a textchat. The files are there already, theres a mod on PC using the ingame textchat structure. This would enable communication and trade ingame instead of having players rely on thirdparty programs like discord or websites like reddit to create the multiplayer aspect of the game.
---
This thought proper rib tickled me.
---
OP is garbage.
---
*guys has 2 knifes*
---
*guys has in next shot only 1 knife*
---
Really really good scene, 10/10 would watch again
---
I doubt it.
---
If Bethesda are going after cheaters they'd start at the top, and I don't think 100 is exactly the limit of all the duplication bugs.
---
And, before you ask, I have no idea if 1,000 would be the threshold either.
---
See, I knew you would come around.
---
Is it just me or do these diseases last way longer now after that latest crap patch?
---
It’s called sarcasm 
---
I believe its called a perfect rating with high replayability. 
---
Found one dead next to an Albino Death claw I killed at Valley Galleria, no other dead traders near by.
---
&gt; I need 3 legs 2 chest
---
What mutation is that?
---
LOL :)
---
I keep finding myself stopping a reflex to pickup clipboards at work. Especially since we have a bunch of old beatup wood ones. Ive never actually done it, but it always makes me laugh when i have that 1 second jolt of questioning which reality im in
---
God bless the Lord of RNG.. 
---
I think it can depend on how much you travel as well. I'm level 120. Some legendaries have been good. Some great. Some awful. But I usually have a load of random at any given time. 
---
My third time fighting the sbq It dropped a lvl50 sentinel chest. Second time I couldn't loot it. First time it was ultracite vent and shower plan. 
---
&gt; Now, I'm stuck with the Modus commendation quest not updating when I kill starred creatures... :(
---
Ow.
---
I couldn't be bothered finding starred creatures, just went for SB's.  Easy enough to kill, easy to find.
---
Although they aren't taking I think they're kind of listening. Still hoping for the .50 Cal recieves to be adjusted but who knows when that will be 
---
You’ll find that board at least 80 more times on your journey to lvl 50
---
Oh jeez, sorry, just realised I put in wrong sub!! Sorry everyone
---
They should really just separate PVE/PVP already.
---
This kind of system mechanic abuse is just pathetic.
---
I hit fissure prime once and no one came so I tried to solo her. Went great till a scorched mirelirk queen blindsided me. The bitch resets if no one around to keep her fighting. Just fyi. Think it's doable tho. 
---
"Discoed" hehe that reminds me of a funny thing in Jedi Outcast if I remember correctly. We could use a little trick to make our Light Saber turn red, blue, green, etc. If someone asked how we would tell them open console and type disco saber. It would disconnect them from the server.
---
I think I met your Gatling in Borderlands...
---
Thanks for your thoughts. I'm hoping this game is not going to be dropped and that they do indeed release viable patches and DLC that pulls back lovers of the Fallout canon.
---
My character unabashedly loves the hot pink pipgirl and new lvl 50 instigating +50% limb damage hunting rifle she got for Valentine’s Day.   
---
You got an instigatoring hunting rifle? Lucky
---
Pvp works on servers right now, just people don't know how to play it. I could make super long post about it, but people woldn't care or just downvote that.
---
So what is proper update schedule to you? What is the proper communication?
---
Im pretty sure legendary armor is always heavy.
---
My first legendary hunting rifle of any type, and it was a not-bad 2* instigating!   I’m psyched! 
---
Not my character's style. I'm betting not 95% of the characters in the wasteland's style, however few that may now be.
---
If they don't have a PA specific title they are likely for the Excavator PA, look at what they scrap to and that will tell you what they go on.
---
Sometimes things don’t work right and I drop it till it’s fixed
---
I think they should just shut it all down, after they make a fully moddable single player mode. Bethesda needs to stop doing work the community can do better, for free.
---
The Servers will soon be stable because of all the PPL leaving than they can increase the stash and make it an dev-only-game. Congrats.
---
Define good meaningful patches.
---
Nice! I just played today for the first time in weeks, only legendary I found graciously gave me a cloaking wood arm for my troubles.
---
it works but it's far from balanced, mainly because of legendaries but also because the core mechanics of the game.
---
Which is an *enitely* different argument from what we started with. 
---
That's easily fixed by using item ID's so it can't be duped.
---
Its rpg, you collect gear, get better. This can't be balanced. You have to do some tactic for different people. Yeah sentinel/assasin is OP, but there were ower powered metas in every mmorpgs with PvP. You can still kill them using staggering weapon, so all melee/explosive/gamma gun,...
---
The poor bot stuck in Camden park has some zingers. 
---
I've given up grinding for legendaries, for the ssme reasons you're frustrated.
---
They need to fix the Legendary system.
---
I played first 65 levels as stealth sniper.  Have tried a few other styles—currently a bloodied melee build.  But this is a gun that may make it fun to go back to my roots for a while. 
---
No I would like to hear your side of this
---
I mean the PipBot skin, but maybe it would suit one of my alts.
---
C.A.M.P boundary isn’t a circle, it’s a sphere. Put it on top of something elevated and you can build higher, though then the ground level starts getting smaller too
---
It's a mmo, sadly grinding is a part of it you'll have to accept. 10 hours isn't so bad, I'd hate to see how long I've been grinding on other mmo titles.
---
I agree the game has problems but this isn't one.
---
you're forgetting cavalier, bloodied, stealthboys, vats. the list goes on and on. a fully equipped player has a massive edge over everyone else. a poverty build with just unyielding or emergency protocols can't stand up to it.
---
but even if they disabled legendaries on pvp servers entirely, which is my preference, people would just turn to Dragons.
---
If you're on Xbox I have an excavator calibrated shock mod you can have later...as long as it hasn't been auto-scrapped.
---
Might as well open a farm in my stomach for the about of Rad Worms I have.
---
EA don't give a fuck - they are everything that's bad about gaming and buying their products just keeps them and other shitty publishers doing what they do - you are the problem.
---
Nice reference.
---
Dont helmets not provide any stat dmg resistance though? Least I know if you find one in the world and put it on, it doesnt. Although I havnt crafted any of the robot helmets to know if they provide dmg resistance either.
---
I think you're bang on with Fort Defiance. It has so much of a lot of things: plastic, steel, alumimum, glass, and straight jackets. Straight jackets are *so* good to sell.
---
TSE over nerfed. No one asked for card nerfs. Last patch broke the game, it's unplayable atm.
---
I am using istagasting hunting rifle and can kill anyone if he dont have full assasin/sentinel gear. Bloodied is cool, but they have 19% of hp thats 60hps on average, even with 60% damage reduction from power armor you can kill them with 150damage weapon withou armor piercing magazine/perks,...
---
Stealthboys are cool, but if you have perception, you can still vats once you "spot" them which is instantly cause sneak is now bugged.
---
Cavalier works only when sprinting. Yeah run away i don't care.
---
Vats is part of game like comeon :D
---
Legendaries are part of game from FO3...
---
One of the community managers mentioned that players use wood armor, but Im level 194 and have literally never seen another player wearing it— I honestly dont know why it has a legendary variant, let alone in the game.
---
I can understand the frustration but I'm 100% agreed here.
---
Interesting, thanks. 
---
this isn't a fucking mmo, though. Bethesda tried to sell it as one and it's clearly not working. this is not what the majority of the playerbase wanted.
---
On your second point, that's a real bug up my ass as well, the player should be the last to load into the world or an area when fast travelling. I shouldn't be the first thing loaded, then all the assets added, then I get to move and react, This load order has cost me tons of caps in the form of lost junk picked up by other players.
---
Yes, thank you. I was able to sneak by. The first few times I tried, there was a continual flow of SB for some reason. So there was about 10 or more coming at me. This time I only saw two, so it was possible for the sneak tactic. 
---
My request: increase vendor caps limit. 
---
And if you buy something for 500 caps, the vendor should get 500 caps. Not 63. 
---
Good for you (although I have heard that ran can degrade over time) it was just a simple test
---
I think the people that actually earn tokens are on the same boat. There's really nothing else to use them for. The problem is that the daily quests don't trigger reliably, and don't dish out tokens reliably either.
---
I work for a living. No thanks 
---
yes, at one point Legendary Dragons with the right perks would output so much damage the game would reset to it to 0
---
(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ lulz
---
I never said I was quitting lol
---
I'll pick up again in 8 months or next content release. To think I'm just here to publicly quit is a little egotistical.
---
It was fun. Would've like to have seen a PVEVP instances.
---
More story, gives co-op and one guy gets to troll.
---
Not even the PvE side is balanced or designed well or designed at all...thanks to the massive control copy from Fallout 4, plus the netcode issues and laggy servers. We are far away from a good PvP experience, I'm not expecting much advance this year.
---
&gt;I am using istagasting hunting rifle and can kill anyone if he dont have full assasin/sentinel gear.
---
what if they do, though? unless you got an auto there's no way you can put a dent on them. it's even worse if they're splitting between sentinel/cavalier since they can just sprint closer. or just sporting a long range weapon, really.
---
&gt;Bloodied is cool, but they have 19% of hp thats 60hps on average, even with 60% damage reduction from power armor you can kill them with 150damage weapon withou armor piercing magazine/perks,...
---
that's kinda my point. unyielding works- if it drops with sentinel as well. everyone else who're not so lucky and have to turn to PA/emergency protocols, they're dead.
---
&gt;Stealthboys are cool, but if you have perception, you can still vats once you "spot" them which is instantly cause sneak is now bugged.
---
that's *really* situational. stealthboys + melee usually mean you're dead.
---
&gt;Cavalier works only when sprinting. Yeah run away i don't care.
---
away? motherfucker, I'm getting closer
---
&gt;Vats is part of game like comeon :D
---
yeah, exactly. an aimbot is part of the game. let that sink in for a minute.
---
&gt;Legendaries are part of game from FO3...
---
​again, exactly my point. Fo76 is just an online mod for Fo4. and Fo4 was designed with singleplayer in mind, so lots of things are unbalanced or downright broken. and that's OK since there's no player interaction going on in Fo4.
---
the same cannot be said about 76.
---
I started off hating the stash limit, then was ok with it when I figured out how to manage my junk for my most pressing needs. 
---
I’m back to hating it again after the update that released plans. The stash limit prevents you from saving building materials because they’re not immediately beneficial. At one point I had plenty of concrete, wood, and cloth but bulked it and sold it off because I needed more space for adhesive and screws, etc. 
---
When I went to build my new CAMP I had to spend time searching for wood and concrete that I once had plenty of but had to get rid of because of the stash limit. 
---
In a survival game that is centered on collecting junk, crafting, and building a stash limit so low makes very little sense and is frustrating. It’s essentially a limit that forces grinding. 
---
Oh so people can't be passionate about something they care about and want fixed? Sorry man! 
---
You earn atoms until a certain point, after that its just a little bit per day. Their bet was the store it seems, they wanted a slice of the live service market.
---
that's fine and all but doesn't change the fact you're wrong.
---
I don't grind for leg anymore I gave up on getting anything. I have spent endless hrs farming ws nuke zone untill it goes away and non nuked ws also many other places and events. 
---
    For me know its just getting stuff to sell to all the venders and giving away or dropping the rest. 
---
     But still have hope maybe the rng for me will change.  I am lvl 112 not that anything over lvl 50 matters.  
---
It's my show..er and I'll grunt if I want to, grunt if I want to, grunt if I want to...
---
You would grunt to if it happened to you!
---

---
Personally I have given up for now, but that doesn't mean I won't go back to it at a later date. The only thing that gutted me was the fact I paid a full £50 for the game only for it to be on sale 3 weeks later.. 
---
I hope it can be salvaged! I really do!
---
I enjoyed the time that I played but I got bored very easily.. 
---
A central player HUB, Auction House and Group Dungeons/Raids are a must going forward.. 
---
If this game took a page out of ARK's book in terms of survival and how brutal that game is.. then this would have felt like true apocalyptic survival in a Fallout World.
---
Way late to the party but this seems like its going to be another patch that isn't going to change anything meaningful.  Yeah some of this issues are important to some people, but, for a lot of us, this is just going to feel like another patch where nothing important changes.
---
The high level feature notes of an upcoming patch shouldn't be able to be summarized into "we fixed some bugs" after two weeks of development.
---
Add in the inevitable regressions, prepare for another angry mob on patch day.
---
Heya!
---
I’m from Melbourne, and just started the game 2 days ago. Only level 17 but I’m looking for friends to team up and play with. Throw me an invite if you’re keen :)
---
IGN: alaserus
---
I feel like executioners is under rated. Its pretty nice. 
---
I agree with this guy. I am so sick and tired of reading posts on here from people that think they speak for everyone.
---
Okay sis :)
---
Add on a fuck ton of Fallout 4 titty vault suit cosplays after never playing a previous entry to the series.
---
I’ve been suggesting #2 for a while now, specifically referencing the fact that a browser based MMO (runescape) could do it over a decade ago. There’s no excuse for BGS to not be able to pull it off. 
---
There was a lot of grinding in that game too iirc (I haven’t played it since I was a kid)
---
Gender appropriation :-O I'll have to report you to the appropriate authorities and social justice groups...
---
Besides what was said about camps hydraulicman which is correct, workshops have their own special limits. 
---
I would not assume all workshops have the same max height, and the max height might depend on particular spot on the workshop. I recall the same applied on F4, for example that one farm you quickly find from Santuary, had, I recall, it's ceiling in different hight on different parts of the place. Or least in uneven terratory you can go higher from ground, if the ceiling is flat in sky.
---
(speculating, in workshops the ceiling height might be bind to the workshop device altitude, so that nuclear waste dump in particular allows pretty fun things, because there it's fairly high in the building. I really liked the platform I made on it, combination with the radiactive pit under it, creates it like a huge grill. If only we could build SB luring devices so you could lure those, and then try to kill them just so they fall on the grill...)
---
I would still like it to be more like LOTRO flavored legendaries that gain xp and you can kinda mold them the way you want.   In the end, you can turn them into gems to put in the pommel of your next legendary to increase abilities
---
Thats right...  I got a furious Gauss Rifle,  it's super effective against 50_80 lvl S. B. 
---
My power armor must be pretty porous and resemble Swiss cheese for the decontamination shower to affect me so much, no wonder I keep getting diseases in a suit that prevents radiation getting through... wait what!?
---
Part of me agrees that we need more stash space for weapons that we may use in the future. 
---
That was my problem. 
---
Part of me though thinks that this is part of the challenge of the game. 
---
Balancing your stash storage with what you use and what you don’t and if you’re short of some particular materials, you have to venture out into the world to find them. 
---
Those who played and 100%’d  FO4 will agree that you were left with no challenge. 
---
It’s really dull when you have an almost endless supply of materials. 
---
I prefer the challenge myself. 
---
It's a good spot for it. Everytime I try to give aid and ammo to low levels they almost always run. 
---
Furious in Fallout 76 is garbage compared to what it use to be in Fallout 4.
---
Its +5% damage per hit and caps at 50%
---
where as in Fallout 4 it was +15% damage per hit and had no cap, making it pretty much the only Legendary effect other than Explosive you wanted on lower damage faster firing weapons.
---
Well of course, 100 being the baseline.   
---
Extra steel, lead, screws, springs...
---
But you also dont need as much ceramics, copper, Asbestos and other things unless you are building many electrical conduits.
---
I use 100 as an example, but some self-limit.  Works just fine.
---
My friend gets addicted to psycho almost daily! He downs the stuff like every chance he gets!
---
If they have sentinel/assasin, i have to make them move or swich weapon for something staggering. It is about tactic, skill and gear you get by playing. Thats what RPG is about, making character that is strong.
---
I don't say this game is best pvp game. I just say pvp in fallout 76 work. 
---
You can say fortnite have bad pvp because you can't build, other players kill you because they can build and building is stupid mechanic. 
---
Legendaries, vats, stealth,.. thats part of this game. If you fight someone who know how to use those mechanics better than you, you lose. 
---
100% Armor penetration is a hell of a thing, they might as well have been naked.
---
Ultracite:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ultracite_ore
---
I recall there was mentions in Glassed cavern about how it's created. Terminals and stuff. I got the impression AMS was creating it, they used nukes to mine the ground and voila it becomes ultracite. Like ultracite would be some isotope of uranium or possibly coal.
---
It's been a while since I've been there, but have you checked the Mount Blair excavator? It's owned by Hornwright. All the surroundings of it are barren and only small warehouse shacks exists, but the excavator might have some faces, particularly I would check the top level 3 floor which you can access with elevator. It seemed semi-odd, because if you go there, there's nothing. Just a "nice view" but since it's excavator, there's not even any scenery cafe. I guess it makes sense you can still get up there but it seemed quite empty. Same thing with second floor from the elevator, which was just an empty platfrom you can't do much but jump down with PA.
---
Also in lore, Hornwright is very evil with their full automation and fuck people and enviroment policy, while Garrahan was their opposite who cared for employement of their workers. AMS and Robco are more or less not really "in" this way, not really displayed to have a stand, although particularly AMS is much more evil as they are close to Hornwright. But Hornwright is like personified devil, while AMS is just evil big company. 
---
You’ll have to spend your time there living in the sink though. 
---
Also keep in mind that this subreddit is also a very very small portion of the playerbase. Bethesda does not only gather to the few % of players in this subreddit. We are just a drop in the bucket.
---
Interesting read from this blog here: http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/149466049419/80-20-5
---
Nice! i've done something similar before Patch 5 hit just for the giggles ;) laughs was usually ensued after it when said campowner noticed it. ;)  
---

You realise that as soon as you'll release that roadmap you've been working on for 3 months, we'll point out issues with it and you'll have to either redo it entirelly or admit you don't care about your players.
---
Doesn’t that mean you shat yourself to death?
---
The Splattercannon was awesome. Totally worth the cap investment.  Haven’t tried furious guns in 76 yet. 
---
To add more to this behind the club there is a bin of golf balls next to a trashcan full of plastic food trash... 
---
Other enemies spawn there too. Sometimes it’s Scorched, sometimes Yao Gui, stingwings, etc. 
---
Sure, I have stashed 5 cores.  Thats all thats needed in order to get more cores really.   Dont even need 5, just maybe 2-3.   No need to store more.
---
I store 4 PA.  I store about 2 weapons and about 3-4 pieces of armor.
---
I set my stash limits to 70 of each item, cept steel/lead.   For those, I keep ores instead because takes less room.
---
I have been trying to get Vangard armors to try out so been swapping out other armors for them.  Next I will be trying wood armors.  So yes, I get all those points, but I do not have a stash issue really.
---
If I need anything  more than 50-70 junk, I go get some.
---
I do NOT store heavy weapons in my stash though.  (Gatlings, Launchers, Ect)  I do store a couple rifles though. &lt;shrug&gt;
---
Yup that's what my game turned into. I was logging in everyday just to sell stuff. After 20+ days it got boring. My last 2 nukes were DCed so I realized I needed a break. 
---
I'm now working on beating Assasins Creed Origins (yeah I'm way behind with those games) maybe when I get done they'll be something worth doing if not I have AC Odyssey to start next.
---
I still love the community here so I check back often hoping for good news.
---
Also still waiting for these
---
It depends on what you are after— I still get two shots, 3* melee and armor. Nothing super exciting, but they still drop.
---
Over two months of having 1800+ atoms reserved to buy this skin if it ever comes back. Why the hell did they take this away but leave all the other crap in the store?
---
Same thing here... I did have some luck last time I was there. I made some armor and a couple of rocket powered baseball bat's to a lvl5. :) I think it's a fun weapon to start the game with. 
---
I can craft a whole T-60 T-51b &amp; ultracite+Raider can't do T45. I spent 3 weeks only playing 76. 
---
Highly agreed.
---
I get why you dont have starched Genes, those extra 2 perk slots are used for something else.  Just have to be cautious of any rad arches and using Radaway.  I've made a few mistakes myself so not sure if I trust me not making a mistake.
---
But you probably run a bloodied build as well as your combo with the healing.
---
Well yeah i added the 5th because i mean places like that cavern you can acces with brass key in runescape. Place full of enemies that keeps respawning with different lvls that are in groups so smaller lvl people can grind with higher lvl people without that the higher lvl enemies would attack to the smaller . (it could be done like they would swarm from some sort of holes or something lol) and yeah maybe that one was bad because i have just played to the point where i need to find the bos headquaters and im at 16 lvl now so i have not explored map that much.
---
Well, what I wrote should have been a comment to your post, but u got the msg. :) 
---
Honestly it's true when they say that a bad game will remain a bad game forever. Even when you talk about NMS now, the vast majority of the people still remember it for the huge disaster it was, and wouldn't want to spend 10 euros for it.
---
That's why I think they just moved on at this point, the game will never sell well, so what's the point in properly supporting it? They will do the few fixes to game breaking bugs and release those vaults, and that's about it as far as content goes I think. 
---
That problem was you are threated as team. And should be. She initiated PvP, gets you dragged in. I think the someone who attacker her camp, only intiated slap damage. Full PvP should only kick in, when she returns to it. Not 100% sure. But 100% sure that's how it works, you are treated as one.
---
I get what you're saying but it sounds an awful lot like "if you fight someone who knows how to use the aimbot better than you, you lose"
---
yeah, the game is still technically playable even with aimbots and yes, you can even defeat players using them, but that doesn't make it balanced in the least.
---
mmos particularly need very precise tuning specifically because of the grinding. I agree growing stronger is part of rpgs, but when rng is so unforgiving and can tip the scales so heavily (sentinel/cavalier), you have a balancing problem.
---
You didn't do the math. You are the one calling me a liar. Getting six decent legendaries pre patch is not surprising. NEVER SAID GOD Roll, the only person that brought it up was you. This post was about Tse. You wouldn't say it to my face. r/iamverybadass anyone? You sound like you are the kind of person that always has to be right all the time. If you sank 1000 hours into any game and still have shit loot that's your problem. Not mine. You need to work on your attitude Mr know it all. 
---
Yup that's me garbage. Garbage that would of helped you out too if you needed a hand. Lol. Sorry to be a good person in a world full of ppl like you :)
---
The autos have very good paper dps already, and in theory should outperform their single counterparts, it's just that they get boned over entirely by the amount of armor on enemies, if you compare their power against level 20 mobs it's clear that they can do work against opponents with an appropriate amount of armor, it's just that all enemies have over the top amount of armor.
---
Ai,aiaieeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Well starting about  4 weeks ago prior to patch, I have noticed more.  
---
A guy tried to snipe me in Whitesprings when my rad damage was about 90%.  I immediately popped radaway and stimmed.  The guy kept trying to get me.  I never shot him back.  He even tried to mini-nuke me.  Pacifist mode, so I would not hurt him even with grenades.
---
2 days later, a guy approached my CAMP.  I waved at him and expected him to use the stash and workstations.  He blew up my genny and garage door.  Then I noticed his buddy on a distant cliff watching me.  He ducked into hiding.  So they were trying to make me shoot the wanted guy, so they could kill me and take caps.
---
Both events, I perma blocked them and changed servers.
---
I started a new character today because my lvl 25 one got hit with the power armour crazy long limbs bug yesterday. Can't take off the armour and can't fix it after trying for a few hours. 
---
So I'm fucking annoyed. Decide to start a new character. 
---
I'm lvl 4 and this lvl 101 guy asks to trade. Yeah cool whatever I won't have anything you want I think to myself. 
---
After looking at my shitty stuff they then drop a bag with almost every serum, a shit load of stimpacks, and some trucked out weapons for me for nothing.
---
They then take me to Whitesprings to level me a few levels. Got heaps of experience and some crazy ass weapons for when I level up.
---
Don't ignore high levels. You could be missing out.
---
Safe travels wastelanders.
---
The loot system in fo76 is all rng???? You are starting to lose credibility on your entire argument. Their is also rumor that its server side on which server has the Tse weapons. If you want to get into God rolls I have 2 Tse that would be considered that, 3 melee weapons, and 0 sentinel armor pieces but 4 mis matched that have +3 to all stats at low hp for a bloodied melee build. 
---
Then why play and why argue? 
---
I would abuse this for my own selfish desire to hoard flux.
---
For stealth builds, the best is a set of wood armors with Shroud mod.
---
This is great, but it should've been known weeks in advance, to let people point out flaws in your updates.
---
You need to solve the overarching issue of how grindy the game is, and give us more end game content, because people are giving up on the game the more it stales. 
---
Never had outfits work but I do know combat helmet can be learned as I just got it yesterday scrapping 4 helmets and I have yet to see any helmet give defense or other bonuses. 
---
If on Xbox I will gladly give you a couple non duped explosive or Tse weapons. OP just had shit luck. 150+ hours and now the game just sits. 
---
The favoriting problem has become a real aggravation now that I have two handmades that are for diametrically opposed purposes (reflex sight +drum for CQB / NV scope +10rd mag for ranged). 
---
I managed to find an explosive junkie's western revolver once when I was in the 50+ range. Found a couple 2 shots but never a TSE drop and I'm close to 120.
---
When you and your squad are going off on 50+ kills but then the trench foot catches up
---
I love TLJ as well, there are some iconic scenes in that movie.
---
I even have a legit tse sniper, but I would love a reset.  My tse sucks now anyway after the nerf
---
Give me one good reason why anyone should follow in Bioware's footsteps? A company who murdered the Mass Effect franchise. 
---
I played nms when it first released and my God it was awful. I did pick it back up for that $40 price tag when it came back out on xb1 and enjoyed it alot more. I've given fo76 a break for now because their is other titles coming out and anthem took everyone by surprise. I agree with you 100% and hope you are wrong 100% if they would have kept up with good patches and been more open with us people would trust it more. The company really needs to do something to make this right. I'm sure their mobile game sales are down as well as morale in the direction of the company all together. 
---
Just, um, maybe just cook your food before you eat it?
---
Your game is so bad that a bullet list of those fixes seems like things that shouldn't even be bullet lists. This game is so broken and boring at end level that while you're fixing basic things people get to top level and leave because there is nothing to do. You've lost me as a customer Bethesda because of how badly planned and organized this game is. 
---
I do the same, I downvote every salt I see, even if I happen to agree, because I would like it to have more rational discussion not "This sux!"
---
I’m interested in one at 600 caps
---
IGN johnnymo
---
Make sure that roadmap is kept up-to-date and constantly referred too whenever you release more updates. Fo76 was disappointing at launch but that would've been okay if it was handled properly.
---
So this's the actual firefighter outfit, the helmet of which is on a gravestone in The Ash Heap? This's really good to know.
---
Sometimes you can’t leave the server quick enough. In the last two days playing I’ve had my camp attacked three times whilst I was there crafting. I assume they noticed me being still for a period of time and just for shits and giggles decided to travel all the way over to Fatman me. 
---
What I find funny is that I’m from Oceania region and have mainly played with others from here. Not once has my camp been attacked near Whitespring in over 3 months of play.
---
But recently I started playing with people from the US and boom my camp is attacked repeatedly. I get the PvP aspect of the game. I engage in it myself and have had great fun with it.
---
As I said I find it funny it’s seems here in Oceania we are taking the whole rebuilding Appalachia thing seriously and in Merica they just want to continue destroying everything...
---
Not intending to be an insult if anyone is offended. Just and observation. 😊
---
Glad my comment recieved this reply, as well as the others and PM's. Such a good read, falls into the fan-lore quite well. 
---
Explosive damage registers fine, only orbit strike damage has been reduced.
---
Unique IDs was not mentioned anywhere on this branch of thread. 
---
Any single bullet can't be assigned an ID, so much for the easy fix.
---
Game over.
---
Mask is... dumb looking IMO.  It just covers the face.  You cannot wear helmet with it either.
---
Looch_P but I'm in SA. 
---
I didn’t refer to wacky armor pieces. I said wacky outfits and bullshit. As in tropical suits, nurse outfits and fucking fruit hats. Which is what one would see in fortnite esque games.  
---
And I literally have never played fortnite. No interest at all. Just have friends that do hardcore.
---
Noice noice
---
I've never got the obsession with mule characters. It just seems, I don't know, kinda cheaty. It's a solution to an unintended problem hoarders have with this game, instead of just adapting to the new rules 76 puts out there.
---
Yes! I forgot to mention the straight jackets.
---
I have 4 charisma, just for 'Lone Wanderer', and 'Hard Bargain' when selling.  With this setup I get 44 caps per straight jacket.
---
Indeed I do wish I was wrong as well, because tbh I like Fallout 76's gameplay a lot (When it works, of course). But honestly having to deal with having to wait 20 to 30 minutes to loot a SBQ and the junk that I previously dropped thanks to dying from a combination lag and Sb spam attacks... Well that alone (A game breaking bug that's been there for 4 weeks now) is really making me feel like the game is on life support at this point. 
---
&gt;You didn't do the math.
---
you can't even bring yourself to open up a calculator? fine. the odds are **0.00069%**, rounded up. and this is just for the 3 legendary mods, you still have to consider everything else.
---
&gt;You are the one calling me a liar.
---
I'm questioning your reading comprehension at this point. **YOU** were the one who outright said what I wrote was false. what I said is that I found your account hard to believe, not outright impossible. do you understand the difference?
---
&gt;Getting six decent legendaries pre patch is not surprising. NEVER SAID GOD Roll, the only person that brought it up was you. This post was about Tse.
---
and my first post, the one you replied to, clearly stated that I was talking about a god roll, not just a TSE. since **you** replied to **my** post, you have to take what I wrote into context. that's how it works, obviously. but you didn't. you just said you rolled 6 legendaries, without specifying whether they were godly. and since you were replying to my post, because of the context, one would assume they were godly. I honestly don't know how to explain this further.
---
&gt;If you sank 1000 hours into any game and still have shit loot that's your problem.
---
that's everyone's problem. it's a balancing issue. legendary gear is very important and locking it behind a 0.000001% rng is not a good idea.
---
&gt;You wouldn't say it to my face. 
---
&gt;You sound like you are the kind of person that always has to be right all the time.
---
&gt;You need to work on your attitude Mr know it all.
---
I would, because you're still wrong. and no, not all the time. just when people are wrong. which you are. perhaps my attitude is shitty, but you should really hear what I'm saying instead of digging your heels in because that just makes you sound silly.
---
He can say whatever he wants about whatever he wants, kid.
---
Someone dun goofed.
---
I found server weightless marine armors, but they were mostly 1 star.  They are on vendors all the time
---
Part of the problem is that the highest quality weapons with the most desired stats were duped like crazy. This gave the illusion that such useful weapons were more commonplace than they actually are. You shouldn't expect to find a TSE anything in 10 hours , the odds are far too low for it to drop. 
---
7 one-star wood armor pieces
---
Yesterday and today i found a TS pump and TS pipe rifle. Tbh those are the best weapons i found  since december. 
---
Morgantown Airport with Pharma Farma on for 20-25, then watoga mayor office for 8 more.
---
Right?! Pop a Grape Mentats and you *might* get 50 :). I've been able to sell them for 50 with this setup.
---
Serious question: Considering the fact they already have your money, why would they care that people are "giving up" on the title?
---
Yeah somewhere in jungle, but not on discusion place about one video game!!!
---
&gt;The loot system in fo76 is all rng???? You are starting to lose credibility on your entire argument.
---
do you have proof that I'm wrong? because aside from polarbear questionable experiment, that's exactly how it works. rng.
---
&gt;Their is also rumor that its server side on which server has the Tse weapons.
---
rumors are just that, rumors.
---
&gt;If you want to get into God rolls I have 2 Tse that would be considered that
---
a god roll by definition is any 3\* that fits your criteria. if you wanted an anti-armor, explosive, faster reload X, and got one, that's a god roll.
---
&gt;4 mis matched that have +3 to all stats at low hp for a bloodied melee build.
---
anyone can roll unyielding pieces.
---
There was a list up a while ago for all plans. Try:
---
http://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aa3n8x/we_are_creating_a_where_do_i_get_that_list_of_all/?st=JS35DFPF&amp;sh=a36964b6
---
No, I don't use bloodied. Yep I've few times accentally healed the mutations, but I can make the most important of them, marsupine, and then randomly just farm whatever I get.
---
I've only once used unyielding to test how much carry capasity I could have it it, pretty much the same as glitched excavator armor which was impressive, but would kinda need to have two star unyieldings at least, and maybe some bloodied explosive weapon. I do have kept few one start bloodied weapons I could try, but I don't know if I can try to make low health build like that, the carry capasity would make functional, I could use those highly boosted boosted specials to take much more advantage from certain perks that increase resistances and other things, throw in nerd rage ect. 
---
It would probably be very functional, but yet I can't make do with it, because I have so much of all sorts of stuff to carry, I can't take those perk cards to boost my resistances enough, without getting nice set of unyielding +weight reduction pieces.
---
What are your fave rifle-type weapons?
---
Slav squat intensifies. I can feel the hard bass from here!
---
Their is no math.. That's what I'm saying you are wrong about. It's literally RNG that's how the loot is determined in this game. Their are no odds, Noone from Bethesda said their were odds. You saying every bit of TSE weapons are duped is dead. Fucking. Wrong. Come say it to mh face right? You just keep backpeddling. Go back to your main account and just stop acting like you know everything when you don't. I'm done with this conversation until you can drop me a link with proof of those numbers that's not from ign or some shit and actually from Bethesda or people who have gone into the games code. 
---
How are they doing?  I thought Bethesda patched all the rule methods.
---
You. Are. Making. Up. Statistics. End of story. Until you show me a link I will continue "digging my heels in" drop the attitude. You are not always right. Go complain about the game to someone else or just stop playing it. 
---
In real life antibiotics suppress your immune system. So it should be the other way round.
---
Never had one get stuck for more then a few seconds. Which is pretty on par for most game pathing for non scripted NPCs.
---
... or it could be the entirely expected fallout (heh) from the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act. 
---
Need a toilet under the back part.
---
I've been doing runs at Morgantown High School and usually get like 160 plastic or so. It's full of plastic pumpkins and cafeteria trays. Make sure to hit the gym as there's a table with a big pile of plastic plates on it as well as more pumpkins
---
Then I ended up trying to hunt some yao gui.  Got 200 lbs of meat but could only carry back  20
---
Oh those two have been here since launch and they seem like the easiest fixes. I don't know anything about coding so they could be impossible. My favorite bug is when I first turn on the game and pull up my pip boy the entire game freaks out and I can't walk, change guns, or fast travel and the entire pip boy is blank. Leaving me to restart the game and just hope it doesnt happen again. 
---
Yeah there are perks for all of that stuff, environment, food, water, etc. Since swapping perks in and out is part of the normal gameplay, you can just eat and drink anything.

Actually posted Lead Belly by accident. But I want to keep tight regulation on my rads as low health build also. I don't have all of these perks or maxed but I would like to have them and swap them in whenever necessary for the situation.
---
Grand exchange yes. Every thing else no. There is a reason pvp is dying slowly on OS to the point they have to put just about every high level content in wilderness to keep players going in there. 
---
Every time I see that fucker I hit him over the head and move on
---
Do not hoard mindlessly, just manage your inventory a bit better. Keep what you actually need and let go of everything you don't. If you follow these simple rules you'll find out 600 stash space is more than enough for your adventuring needs.
---
There are plenty of mechanics in this game that probably need a slight redesign, or even an overhaul. Storage isn't one of them. Don't try to fix what's not broken.
---
My mates and I played a different game last night and we had a blast and didn't once suffer from a bug, didn't have any disconnects, didn't have to worry about unrewarding gameplay and weren't stressed at all.
---
We're setting up a "Fallout's Annonymous" to help people get over this
---
Same i was just clicking on him when he tries leave road. That force him to turn around and continue on his route. But then it happened, i was with him in ash heap and that stupid piece of aluminum ran into fire and get stuck there pernamently dyiing. If event didn't end in 30minutes, he would be dyiing there until now.
---
If you move your CAMP thing it will change your spawn in point BTW.
---
On PS4, the edges of the screen/UI are cut off. The game doesn't acknowledge the system's "display area settings" and doesn't have one of its own, unlike most other games.
---
I have a increased damage while aiming Tse gauss and I have Tse faster reload 50cal.. Yeah. Their is proof it was mentioned since the beginning and data mined. I'm done with this. Show me proof of your ridiculous numbers or just drop it. This is stupid and I'm going to work. 
---
Yes some people seem to think 76 is a primary focus from the main Bethesda group.
---
We have plenty of psychopaths on the US servers sadly.
---
I'll pass this along to the team.
---
If they already have or will give up on this game then at least what they should do is open it up to the modders on all formats to at least  try to improve it in their stead. They at that point have nothing to lose in doing so, Bethesda can keep the servers going and keep churning out new atom shop items whilst the modding community improve, fix bugs, patches and introduce new content.
---
Other Bethesda titles have had a new lease if life all because of the mods, I have gone back again and again to skyrim and fo4 just because of that alone 
---
The same could be said of almost any modern media.
---
For example, Spongebob. Back in the day, it was a show both parents and their kids could laugh at. Like the peanut plant hanging over the shitter, or Krabs flushing Plankton whilst saying "Now here comes the chaser!". There are many many more examples of raunchy jokes, and sometimes darker humor. These days, that kind of stuff has been eradicated from modern media. Both kids' and adults' shows alike have been dumbed down and made droll.
---
The same for Fallout. A grand majority of mature themes have been cut out, leaving the game open to a larger audience. If you look hard enough though, you can find the darker stories and tones that you so seem to miss. Such as the Responder's holotape in Morgantown Airport, in a closet upstairs near Maria Chavez's body.
---
He shall suffer for eternity for his sins
---
Indeed, that one is frustrating as well, but at least you don't lose any of your hard grinded junk with it (That you can't even put in your stash as well, since it has been full for months now). 
---
I got it from scrapping Marine arms.
---
Lower part of the screen will show the option to switch categories.
---
I need more space I have 600 pounds of junk and it’s annoying having to hold my extra ammo on another character or my extra guns then relying on a friend to get ammo 
---
Yes, sometimes instead of getting stuck he'd "walk" very very slowly which would also cause the event to fail. 
---
Fast travel? What's that like? If I gain 2 lbs. I feel like a pregnant penguin. I've been dropping like 500 ammo each at train stations, giving fusion cores and stuff away to players. My stash box is full, and I really hate to get rid of my lovely guns. I wish I could have a safe like I had in FO4.
---
Because they're going to lose even the most hardcore of fans if they don't pull a No Man's Sky and fix this dumpster fire.  Quickly.  And those people are not going to buy the next Fallout, Elder Scrolls, etc.  That's why.
---
I honestly feel like that would be quite hard to do in an online game though, perhaps they should do something where they approve patches coming from the modding community and then release them to the public, or something like that. 
---
Had him get stuck a couple of times - on a porch in Harpers ferry. In a cliffside nook. Too bad. Because the payoff at the end, of hearing what ludicrous message was to be delivered, is usually worth it for me.
---
It's on online shitfest, not an MMO like WoW or comparibles are - this of course is obvious to anyone clued up on gaming rather than repeating what Bethesda try and sell us and tell us it is. What comparible grinding was there in the previous Fallout's? That's what you look at and what everyone wanted was a Fallout game you could play with your friends - not a boring grindfest or a poor story and a ripoff cash shop.
---
I *think* you can place the whole base including the sign. You just can’t store the sign and retrieve it. 
---
Fallout76 diseases, a poor man’s r/rimworld 
---
I have also held this opinion in the past but I rarely ever post here because of the toxicity. I fully support this. 76 points would really cut down on having to constantly swap out perks when you want to craft, again if you want to lockpick/hack, and so on.
---
I mean like the wilderness that it used to be not the one that it is nowadays. But yeah i get ya
---
Nah they did not.
---
"Howard said during the press conference that it would be dozens of people on the map, not hundreds and not thousands. Hines reiterated that.
---
“This is *not an MMO* and this is not a battle royale,” he said. “It’s supposed to feel like they just left the vault.”
---
Not re-introducing bugs from previous versions of the game? Not breaking anything when fixing bugs? Something like that.... Ohh and some content while you are at it. It's been almost 4 months since release and zero content added to a LIVE service game. 
---
&gt;Their is no math.. That's what I'm saying you are wrong about. It's literally RNG that's how the loot is determined in this game. Their are no odds, Noone from Bethesda said their were odds.
---
oh, boy. ok, I'll walk you through it.
---
say you want a two-shot/explosive/faster reload shotgun. two-shot is a prefix, there are 23 of those. explosive is a major modifier, there are 7 of those. and faster reload is a minor modifier, there are 9 of those.
---
that means you have a 1 in 23 chance of rolling two-shot, a 1 in 7 chance of rolling explosive and a 1 in 9 chance of rolling faster reload. or, in percentage, 0.04347% for two-shot, 0.14285% for explosive and 0.11111% for faster reload.
---
**however**, you can't look at those odds in a vacuum, since they need to roll sequentially. you don't want just two-shot, or explosive, or faster reload. you want all of them. so you have to multiply those odds. 0.04347 * 0.14285 * 0.11111 = **0.00068**%
---
that's the chance of rolling a "god" weapon. and I'm not accounting for everything else, like whether the mob is a legendary, whether it's a 3\* legendary, whether it dropped a weapon, what weapon it dropped, etc.
---
now, if you *still* can't understand, I really don't know what to say.
---
&gt;You saying every bit of TSE weapons are duped is dead. Fucking. Wrong.
---
not every single one, obviously. but a good chunk, yes. the vast majority in fact. people trade TSEs they \*think\* is legit all the time in the bazaar.
---
&gt;Come say it to mh face right? You just keep backpeddling.
---
but I just did. twice now. I even walked you through it like a child this time.
---
&gt;Go back to your main account
---
this is my main account.
---
&gt;and just stop acting like you know everything when you don't.
---
maybe so. but I know I'm right about this. it's basic math.
---
&gt; I'm done with this conversation until you can drop me a link with proof of those numbers that's not from ign or some shit and actually from Bethesda or people who have gone into the games code. 
---
I mean, *basic math*. you want me to link you Pythagoras?
---
Stuck at a tree before. Didn't do that event again after wasting 5+ minutes waiting around.
---
2 ppl
---
Actually, yeah he can lol. As long as it abides by Reddit's rules he can, so go away please.
---
The game is dead for me, they killed it by drastically reducing the life and availability of power cores, nevermind Crackdown 3 is out Friday for free download on Xbox Game Pass 👍😉
---
clearly not even Bethesda themselves know what the game is at this point. I mean, survival servers? really?
---
No luck on the list or any vendors, scrappin’ it is!
---
Stop hoarding then. Even at 400 it was only a problem for people duping or exploiting.
---
Given the current state of the game, they should be working with a bi-weekly patch schedule for bug fixes, with communication on the off weeks.  
---
This isn't unheard of, as the agile programming methodology uses two weeks sprints for actual application development and incorporates bug testing and fixing right into those two week sprints. I mean, you can look at Minecraft, of all things, with how they track bugs, how they deliver content patches about every 2 weeks, and how they communicate.  That's an old game that's still getting updates and it's not even an MMO
---
It would be nice if their known issues tracker was also updated more than every two weeks.  As it stands right now, we had a hot fix on the 31st and it doesn't appear that they have put any additional work into the game since: the Inside the Vault simply told us that they were making some scorchbeast changes - which is nice, but no indication of when that will be coming, nor any status on some of the more major issues like server stability.  
---
It doesn't help that they have no in game support, so there is no way for people to get back lost things due to major bugs like the Mama Dolce container taking items.  This is something they should be setting up.  
---
They should also use email, as not all players are going to be checking forums. The last email I got from Bethesda regarding Fallout 76 was on Dec 18.  Yet I have received plenty of emails for their other products such as Elder Scrolls Legends. 
---
That would be proper communication and game updates, on par with other studios of their size. 
---
no you
---
Seems like you really sprung into action.
---
I just replied to you with some basic goddamn math. stop splitting the discussion into multiple posts.
---
About lvl 30 should be good with PA and supplies to do the silo.
---
Ahh I see, you are a 5 yr old. Go on then. 
---
For me the wilderness became like tradition with friends like ”hey lets go to the wilderness again” and the fact that it was like no mansland (not the game) gave me huge hype like whos going to die first and then like some 70 lvl dude with rune fulls just rapes all of us lol
---
“we regularly take note of the location of multiple +100s. Any ones along the border are marked for attack at the next nuke drop,”
---
Well gee, I hope you check the names first!  My buddies (100+) and I (125) hang out near the border of the map at my base because we are avoiding traffic and there are some good resource nodes here.  We’re all pacifist and just want to be left alone. 
---
That’s one of the reasons I usually stay crouched when altering my camp - it hides me on the map. 
---
I like this. And you're right, for the longest time I didn't realise you could go above 10 in a stat, because thats what it had been forever. 
---
And when you have chems and armor that can take SPECIALS far beyond 10, why are people getting pissy about getting a few more points to distribute.
---
In the end I think the whole system needs a rework, in regards to perk costs, slots, and making some permanently passive.
---
People tend to forget that the entirety of this subreddit is not the entirety of the game's playerbase.
---
But of course Bethesda should listen and reply to every single whim and whine because otherwise Bethesda bad.
---
The only thing that clearly shows here is that you don't know and are talking shit.
---
Last time I ran across that event the module spawned underground so he just sat there begging me to fix him.
---
People who duped still have 100s if not thousands of their duped items remaining. 
---
It's so funny when you drop a gun at their feet and because they're new to the game they don't even notice and just run off. The other one is like you said when they have to pluck up the courage
---
Swamp gas is from boatfly. You xan find some diseased in the named camp right next the sons of dane compound.
---
Just like the magical Nuka Cola Grape that lets you remove rads and keep mutations!
---
as Todd has said many times before: IT JUST WORKS!!!!
---
I tried to start this revolution once, but didn’t hand out enough pamphlets. 
---
If you’re on PC, I can make them for you free, you just provide the materials 
---
&gt; I have a increased damage while aiming Tse gauss and I have Tse faster reload 50cal.. Yeah.
---
that doesn't mean much. do those meet your singular criteria? is a two-shot, explosive gauss with +% damage while aiming the best possible weapon for your build? because, if so, congrats. you beat the 0.000001% rng.
---
&gt;Their is proof it was mentioned since the beginning and data mined.
---
then link to it.
---
#ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
---
👍
---
Oh I 100% agree with you.
---
I mean, people will play how they want to play. I don't see much point to this post.
---
Is it still 600? Only way I was able to play was to exploit the infinite carry glitch
---
Modded fireaxe was duped too, fudging dupers
---
Heh, I knew Martial Artist affected normal Gatling Guns but not lasers, that's good to know.
---
I don't know if I should laugh or cry
---
I really wanted to play it, but no one else ever does so usually it's just me. :(
---
either the game is a mmo and the grinding is perfectly fine, even though the playerbase seems to disagree, or the game isn't and the absurd rng system needs to be reworked, which is what the topic is about.
---
don't see how any of that is wrong but suit yourself.
---
I have the exact same gun. It’s useful for SBQ because it’s a large target, and for running backwards in Whitespring while a mob of glowing ghouls attack you. 
---
So yes, close quarter combat. Mod it with the faster crank and 500 round magazine and it can handle 20+ ghouls without stopping. 
---
I have 2 stable Cobalt flux you can have for the TSE Gatling gun. PS4
---
This. 
---
You should collect plastic too every time you are outside
---
If you don’t add that people accuse you of not owning the game or just being a ‘hate bandwagon’...
---
Don't hoard so much garbage.
---
You need to choose a less popular spot for your CAMP, or just server hop until it loads in.
---
Scrap weapons to unlock mods. Then you can upgrade your weapons.
---
You don't buy consumables, unless you have a lot of caps and it's something you really need, and you also have Hard Bargain and Unyielding etc. to reduce the price a little. You get ammo from mobs, ammo containers, you make your own (there's a perk ammosmith that helps) and you can make ammo at the munitions factory near the top North North East of the map.
---
There is no math in rng.. Link me to the Bethesda comment that their is a certain percent chance that you will find specific legendary loot. 
---
I think Pacifist should prevent the AoE hit from those effects.  It \*should\* anyway.
---
It could be that those are buggy and allow you to hit-register another player.
---
I've had people melee me once or twice as well, then stop once I did not trigger.  
---
I assume they are trying to kill me the same way you died.
---
You can't seem to link anything so why should I? 
---
😀
---
I refuse to do this event because of the pathing alone. Until that's fixed, I'm not touching it.
---
This is still a lot of bugs
---
It's just a way to make you feel the Enclaves presence without the Enclave being there
---
I agree they are tiny
---
in my camp at whitesprings, while server-hopping loaded up straight into a fight with it (him?).
---
Fact is Bethesda didn't tried to sell the game as an MMO, like you tried to blatantly lie here. The other bullshit you are trying to say now is completely irrelevant.
---
Go into the direction we're you have to go and just talk to him, he turns around to you and there he goes straight without problems. If he stucks just repeat 
---
By all means be passionate but stop parroting the same thing over and over as if we're unaware. btw this was not a direct response to the OP but the posts of  this nature that we've seen a million of. I am a huge fallout fan and the game's not the greatest so i went back to fo4 for a while to give them a chance to fix it...
---
As much as I hate Fortnite........building in Fortnite is a skill.
---
Fallout 76 is pay 2 win.
---
If I turned the game off at whitesprings I will. I still take damage in the weird limbo state and theirs no way to prevent it. That's mostly the reason I stopped playing. The other reason is that when I did get the queen to drop loot it was just explosive vents. I ran so many silos just to get the same drops. 
---
Yeah! I can't store stuff, but then I can't build because my camo budget is full...
---
*boredom
---
Can't you only sell railway spikes to other players?
---
At high levels your build can be whatever whenever. I have 60% of the perk cards unlocked at this point and the rest are just useless in normal circumstances. 
---
Remember to put on Armorer and Scrapper if you have them :).
---
You're totally right, but at least I haven't seen Bethesda bait and degrade their players on their forums like that fat fuck admin at bungie's forums back when people were exploiting the challenge dupe glitch where they simply and merely disconnect their ethernet cable when getting a challenge complete to reset the challenge.
---
Instead of just rolling people back, that company invited people to appeal their bans, including innocent people effected cause their kid or family member duped on their own account on the same console getting everyone banned on that console because they rolled out console bans.
---
It was disgusting and honestly Bungie should fail and burn for their abusive behavior, they don't deserve their positive reputation one bit, destroyed the Halo series before moving on to Destiny which I never played because Bungie will never get another penny from me, but from the sounds of things they haven't learned their lesson one bit.
---
Greedy companies seem to love destroying IP for some crazy reason.
---
Yeah because PA skin gives you god power. What the fuck?
---
Frequently, Snallygasters spawn at the power station just west of Harper’s Ferry
---
Better to include it at the start than have multiple question threads branching off no?
---
Hey there:
---
1. The place you have build your camp on is occupied by another players camp. Relog into another server and the location might be free. There are popular places that are occupied more than others. Look for a place that is not so popular and you won't have this problem.
---
2. There is a perk card for gun smithing. Get that and you can tinker with the guns. And with choice of weapons: It depends on your build/playstyle/available ammo. (eg: Rifleman vs. Commando)
---
3. Don't buy ammo. You can craft it. There are seven moneypools for vendors.  The vendors of the different factions (Responders, Raiders etc.) share a moneypool. This moneypool is refreshed every 22 (or 24) hours. That means you can only make 1400 caps a day max from vendors. Search this subreddit for more info.
---
Nah. 600 is more than enough. What they need to do is increase the vendor cap stash limit so that selling gear you don't need is monotonous. 
---
Will do, I posted that like 1:30 am so wasn't thinking clearly comment again if you'd like
---
Cool to know! Shame it's just easier to use a perk card. Can you only get the grape cola from the Whitespring?
---
Welcome to RNG.
---
Seriously though, they really need to look into legendary loot. It feels mega bad if a 3 star legendary is on a terrible item with terrible effects.
---
I'd like for anything about 1 star to guarantee a certain level of effect. Like a 3 star would have at least one top-tier effect and the others are RNG selected. Likewise for 2 stars, one guaranteed mid-level effect and RNG for the last one.
---
Guaranteeing a certain level of quality is pretty standard for RNG systems like loot boxes or card packs. I can't see why the same couldn't be adopted for legendary items too.
---
Yeah. The Nuka Cola vendor only. One per server, I like to farm them up while server hopping for an x 01 jetpack.
---
This is one of my favorite 76 posts so far, wish the rest of the sub was just as interesting. 
---
There's your problem. Ammo barely makes a dent in weight. It's all the extra weapons and crafting materials which do one in.
---
I really think it's compareable to how ESO started and the state it is in now, a couple of years(!) later.
---
And i really agree with your thesis/view of this game. It was for a very long time the most heartwarming post in this sub. Thanks for that!
---
Magazines run? Is that worth doing?
---
you don't need me to link you to Bethesda, you need me to link you to some basic academic material.
---
https://sciencing.com/calculate-dice-probabilities-5858157.html
---
you have to be trolling me at this point. first because rng *is* math. the only way to manipulate it is by finding the seed. and second because... it's like you can't into logic.
---
if you throw a dice, what's the chance you're gonna land a 6? 1 in 6, right? or 0.16%, 16 percent. now apply the same logic to the game.
---
I think people are starting to wisen up to their tricks. they are on a monthly patch cycle which means that it will be at least 12 months until you see any major change. They are tampering with stats on scorchbeasts and other incredibly small changes. Won't be for a very long time that we see anything really major
---
That's one of the aspects though, no one in my group plays it, that lessens the desire to play it more so. I'll probably give it a shot eventually but at the minute there is nothing about it drawing me in....
---
Dude you are killing it with these! Definitely putting someone out of a job at Bethesda if they actually realised this was necessary.
---
No.
---
Because the dominate players in Fallout 76 because they bought duped gear.
---
I had someone tell me the other day that you can't stagger him in his sentinel armor as long as he is jumping straight up and down..... LOL....... that's not skill..... that is someone who someone who can't build a fort while jumping up and down in Fortnite so they bought duped armor and play Fallout 76.
---
Consoles for minecraft got updates every few months.
---
There is a fee and quality control that updates have to go though for consoles
---
Don't forget Super Duper.
---
Hmm fair enough. Though I've really not Bethesda seen much to inspire from others.
---
Well fuck my tall hat, you managed to construct that reply all by yourself?
---
maybe, but that's not what a god roll is. a god roll is the singular best version of a given equip.
---
Bought all of them! And the Quantum sign
---
&gt;math is not involved
---
please, just stop.

Cheers, I may get round to it at some point but no room at the minute...
---
...to me, it'll probably end up as dead as Bloodbourne......😁
---
I agree with everything you said. I just want to note that Bethesda’s appeal process is a joke and takes you no where. You never get responses and you never get unbanned. 
---
Unless this has been patched, this is wrong.  At the time I did the search, it was listed as WeaponTypeChainsaw in the game files (this was three months ago, mind), and was missing all of the two-handed keywords
---
That's underwhelming
---
Manta mans outfit reminds me of One Punch Mans outfit so I grabbed an instigating power fist and went to town on enemies
---
This thread is cancer
---
Yes, I have tesla coils on my excavator set and it's happened to me a couple times. What sucks is that I then lose all my valuable junk. 
---
To get the most out of this gun:  
---
**Strength**  
---
\- Heavy Gunner 3: +20% Damage  
---
\- Expert Heavy Gunner 3: +20% Damage  
---
\- Master Heavy Gunner 3: +20% Damage  
---
\- Lock and Load 3: +30% reload speed (recommended for most Heavy guns but not really needed for this one...)  
---
\- Martial Artist 3: +30% fire rate? (bumped my fire rate up from 400-&gt;500)  
---
**Charisma**  
---
\- Tenderizer 3: +7% more damage to the target from all sources for 10 seconds (this helps a lot with SBQ fights since everyone is getting a 7% damage buff against her, not sure how DR works into this)  
---
**Intelligence**  
---
\- Gunsmith 5: -50% weapon durability degrade (drastically slows weapon degrading, even though comparatively this weapon already has better than most durability)  
---
\- Stabilized 3: +45% Armor Penetration and increased accuracy while in Power Armor (this perk is an absolute must due to how much it increases effective DPS, decreases Time to kill, saves ammo and weapon durability)  
---
\- Weapon Artisan 3: +200% durability repair (not needed, but with gunsmith 5 this weapon will last a long time)  
---
\- *Nerd Rage 3: +40DR, +20% Damage, +15% AP regen when below 20% health (I don't recommend this one unless you are in a sweaty tryhard group with a dedicated medic)*  
---
**Agility**  
---
\- Adrenaline 5: +10% damage per kill (up to +60% damage) for 30 seconds, kills refresh timer (Absurdly powerful card that bumps your DPS substantially)  
---
**Luck**  
---
\- Bloody Mess 3: +15% Damage  
---
\- One Gun Army 3: 12% Stagger and 12% chance to cripple a limb (great form of crowd control and forcing SB and SBQ to land)  
---
\- Luck of the Draw 3: +chance to repair your weapon a lot (this is triggered when you start firing so if you tap fire instead of holding it down you could possibly make your weapon unbreakable, also added benefit of slightly better accuracy)  
---
Extra tips:  
---
\- Aiming while in third person is bugged and will not hit where your crosshair is so always fight in first person POV  
---
\- Physical aim sight is useless  
---
\- Grabbing stacks from killing trash in Scorched Earth can be worth it for the Adrenaline bonus damage  
---
\- Yeah the Two-shot effect got a heavy nerf but +25% damage compared to a regular gatling gun is still a fantastic legendary effect 
---
I think thats just the chassis w random parts on it.
---
As the playerbase continues to dwindle, there will be less stress on the servers, meaning they can obese the stash limit.
---
Bethesda should do what blizzard has done with wow (aside from making wow a shit game lately) they have a monthly dev Q&amp;A live stream. That would be the best approach to getting feedback and immediate responses from the devs. 
---
*Right!!!*
---
Link to this chart and source info for science reasons??
---
If you’re on PC and talking about the Morgantown airport quest that may have been me. Hi! Meds are heavy af so I like to give mine away when I can. 
---
Wow. A link to how rng works in Pokémon for iv levels... You need to just stop. 
---
&gt;Fact is Bethesda didn't tried to sell the game as an MMO, like you tried to blatantly lie here.
---
maybe not as a mmo but they definitely tried to pass it off as something it's not, leaving it to the players to figure out their own mess. is it singleplayer? is it multiplayer? who knows, let's just hope one of them sticks. currently they're going with survival.
---
&gt;The other bullshit you are trying to say now is completely irrelevant.
---
you mean the very on-topic bullshit I wrote? that stuff about gringing, rng, you know, what this topic is about?
---
oh, ok then.
---
Yeah, but people will come back if they release a good title in the future. Just look at how everyone is downloading Apex Legends after only a few months ago everyone was swearing off EA games forever.
---
1. Your camp can't be placed cause it's in a spot that is already taken by another player. The first time it happened to me the person had their camp right where mine was, almost exactly. The second time it happened the other persons camp was not even close to my spot but i guess there is a certain radius or area that camps can't intersect. Sometimes my camp takes a minute or two to load. But I have it in a secluded place out by the Top of the World in the Savage Divide and rarely has it not spawned.

2. I am level 38 and use two weapons: Hardened Sniper rifle that I found during a quest and the Blade of Bastet up until recently. The sniper rifle is level 12 and I still use it. I have modded it slightly but mostly original. Take all those pipe weapons and the weapons you don't use from your inventory and scrap them. You will learn most of your mods by scrapping all the weapons you come across. DON'T KEEP HIGHER LEVEL WEAPONS. Unless it's a lvl 13 weapon and you're about to level. Getting a no star level 30 gun just takes up valuable inventory space. Also really good mods for weapons and armor cant be added to weapons/armor without leveling up the appropriate perks. 
---
3. I don't know how to get a lot of caps. People offering Caps for guns on here and other sites I don't understand how they have so many. I have a little over 3000 right now but most of that us from leveling, questing, and killing super mutants (they always have caps on them). Also do the daily events. Some are easy sources of caps, exp, and loot. 
---
Haha exactly what I did!! :D
---
One guy told... :D comeon boi. You can kill everyone in this game. There is not any godmode gear.
---
pokemon is a great example of how rng works. what you want me to do here, draw? I mean, you actually went and said that math has no bearing at all in rng.
---
rng means random **number** generator.
---
I rather like this idea 
---
So you have to leave the green circle before you’re flagged? Safe while in there?
---
I'm sure New Vegas tried to use what F1 used F2. The different effects, different ammo were originally there, however they were terribly bugged so only one ammo was good and AP was a joke.
---
The system wasn't very elaborate on NV either. Even if they weren't bugged, I don't recall trying to particularly use specific ammo on specific targets.
---
Bethesdas KISS method is best.
---
I have same arguments about PvP. People are toxic, becouse they are not winning. Don't take those idiots seriously.
---
Went with a group to take down SBQ and several SB in Scorched Earth and it was a blast.  What wasn’t a blast was hanging around for the loot to drop.  That’s got to change. 
---
The problem with drops is we don't really know and they don't make it transparent so we are left to guess. There seems to be no pattern. It all seems to be completely RNG. Some people can get lucky with RNG, some people can get unlucky. That has always been the case. Who knows? Will they tell us? Will they change the loot and legendary systems to something a little less like complete RNG lottery? Who knows?
---
For one a dice roll isn't rng. Stop using Pokémon logic here. That's not how this game works. Their is a different algorithm for rng in every game. They don't all use the stuff from pokemon. (great franchise BTW. Honest and yes you can manipulate rng with that game) if you are just saying the number of legendary varients multiplied by the different weapons then multiplied by the chance that its a gun in the first place (armor is the same x variable as for weapons) multiplied by the chance that you are even going to get a legendary and not a drill drop or flare gun or anything at all (where the math gets literally impossible because no one knows those numbers) then yeah sure but that's not the numbers you came up with and that's still not rng. Rng in this franchise means that I could kill six different legendary monsters back to back and get God rolls from every one of them. We are not catching shiny pokemon. That's not what this is. It's a different ballpark all together and you know it. 
---
They get the update after months of open testing with snapshots that are made available to everyone, with a bug tracker of the issues found during snapshots.  Now, snapshots may not be open to consoles (but then again I was initially thinking Java edition, not bedrock) but they do at least offer testing for future updates.  And I'm just talking new content, not just bug fixes. Some companies, such as blizzard, still do their PTR for PC even though they do not do it (to the best of my knowledge) for consoles, sure you might not get EVERY bug, but balance fixes and feedback can still be gathered if they did some form of public testing (lets not even get into how they had BETA but not only did this not do anything for server stability, but bugs reported during the BETA were not addressed promptly)
---
The fee should be expected as a cost of doing business - and again, major issues like server instability, should be fixed regardless of the cost.  We should not be 3 months in on a game and still have them saying "will be addressed in a future update". Stability should be a number one priority over actions such as the nerfs we have had on some perks that we have had. 
---
Not even gonna read that, blocked, stop spreading lies here.
---
*Phew* Glad you told me, I was about to engage and have fun with the game for a moment there!
---
What bugs that are not minor graphical ones?
---
Kind of ignored they hot fixed those problems in 4 days and apologized for it.  It happened once.
---
4 months without new content is standard.  Particularly after fans cried out to bug fix before new content. 
---
If that roadmap doesnt include making the game an actual fallout game (that includes adding npcs) by God I'm uninstalling this garbage 
---
I didn't read the thread but statistically speaking he is correct. It's insanely rare to get these drops. It depends on how much time you spend playing the game, professional video poker players hit a Royal Flush far more often than your casual player.
---
Just because something isn't probable doesn't mean it isn't possible.
---
Navada doesnt make toast . 
---
A DICE ROLL. IS. NOT. RNG. in the same way it works in video games. This is redundant. If their is no set way items drop their is no way to determine the probability that they will give you certain items. It works with medical containers in the game, it works with other items but with legendary weapons you have no real way to say "oh its this percent" because their are so many variables. I've found AAE weapons Tse wepons and faster swing better heavy damage etc. Weapons withing ten minutes of each other. Do I just get very lucky or is it RANDOM? 
---
An interesting idea, but the reason flora and minerals change from a nuclear strike is because the warheads being made in the silos are &gt;!Ultracite-loaded!&lt;. It's in the story.
---
This is not a good idea seen as the amount of dope mini nukes out there I dont wana crash anytime someone decides to go ramping out 300 in a row
---
Excellent perk guide for the gatling.
---
Sadly Im on PC, I think I got all you need, at least the headwear :(
---
Insert memory from old childhood toast movie here.
---
Yeah like enemies returning health, thus becoming unkillable? With all of the patches there were new bugs, even if they fixed something. Go back and check those threads. Also go and checkout the comprehensive bug list threads lol. There are a LOT OF BUGS. But whatever, you can think that there aren't I don't really care. I was answering to a question. 
---
Please just fix the disconnecting problems.
---
And increase our stash limit.
---
These two things are all I ask, just prioritize them.  Disconnects are **destroying** this game.  Absolutely *leveling* it to rubble.  Fix them and so much will get better so fast, an uninterrupted game session is a good game session even if some bugs get in the way.
---
I'm literally here right now because I just disconnected...
---
Those are great places to look for resources, but not really accessible at lower levels (especially the Whitespring golf club, with so many high level players spawning high level ghouls and such). But definitely good for later on.
---
Okay
---
I can dig through my post history if his name is important.
---
Fallout 76 PvP is for people who couldn't fit gudder at Fortnite. True story.
---
Oh no doubt about it being possible. What I was saying is in a game like this where you have a chance to get a drill or sometimes even nothing from an enemy the number is literally not knowable and he was giving me "exact numbers and I don't understand math" I want it to be noted that I've found multiple Tse weapons withing minutes of each other pre patch nuking whitesprings. What I'm saying is in a case like this the drops are literally random. Like the r in rng. 
---
Also, they messed up bulking then they fixed it and now when you scrap all, all your bulked junk becomes unbulked. See, trying to fix a bug and introducing a new one, but that is just one example, I suggest you checkout the comprehensive bug threads if you are interested in more. 
---
Oh yeah, I'm in your camp, if that wasn't clear. I stopped playing regularly after the "hotfix" that broke everything and I stopped playing entirely after the last Inside the Vault. 
---
If you're facing a player thats taking no damage while standing still or sprinting, use a gamma gun, folks
---
This is what I was saying! If we had consistency we could do the math but this guy. This guy figured it out apparently. I tried explaining it is truly random in this situation because legendary enemies can drop drills or even nothing that makes it truly unpredictable. Truly... Random one might say. 
---
That first one seems like a straight dig at Bethesda and FO76
---
Apparently this guy is winning. 1k hours in and claims theirs a. 000001 chance or something that a "God roll" Tse will drop and don't question him on it. He's done the math. 
---
Thanks for the list :)
---
EA &gt; Bethesda
---
confirmed.
---
I guess this goes here. VATS do not target a player on a Versus event (specifically, Monster Mash.) Apparently combat needs to happen beforehand.
---
Interesting because non-aggressive players get selected outside of Versus events, this is incredibly annoying when fighting SBQ.
---
Can you quote it so we know what you are talking about?
---
Yes, it is the fault of the buggy game, but I have also asked friends to not build in my CAMP, as this has happened before with simple cooking stations.
---
For some reason people don't notice the Stove in my camp, so they kept building cooking stations, I would scrap them, but lost some budget every time till there was not enough to build anything.
---
This does not happen with stuff I build, only when others build, with the exception of wires which can totally screw a camp budget.
---
☝️This is one thing (well 2 things) that get me grumpy. 😖
---
If it was one star that could have been anyone. For high level chars one stars are toys.
---
Craft them into antibiotics with chemist and super duper. Cures diseases and adds disease resist. 
---
&gt; For one a dice roll isn't rng.
---
it's probability. that's what rng tries to emulate. please, I beg of you, do some research.
---
&gt;Stop using Pokémon logic here. That's not how this game works. Their is a different algorithm for rng in every game.
---
it's *exactly* how this game works. the rng algorithm may be different but it achieves the same thing.
---
&gt;and yes you can manipulate rng with that game
---
you can manipulate any rng if you can find the seed. that's the flaw with every system, it's not "true" probability.
---
&gt; if you are just saying the number of legendary varients multiplied by the different weapons then multiplied by the chance that its a gun in the first place (armor is the same x variable as for weapons) multiplied by the chance that you are even going to get a legendary and not a drill drop or flare gun or anything at all
---
that's exactly what I'm saying
---
&gt;where the math gets literally impossible because no one knows those numbers
---
how? the wiki lists how many legendary mods there are in the game. it's 23 for the prefix, 7 for the major and 9 for the minor.
---
&gt;then yeah sure but that's not the numbers you came up with
---
it's exactly the numbers I came up with.
---
&gt;and that's still not rng. Rng in this franchise means that I could kill six different legendary monsters back to back and get God rolls from every one of them.
---
that's what rng is, period. you could find 6 shinies back to back as well.
---
&gt;We are not catching shiny pokemon. That's not what this is. It's a different ballpark all together and you know it.
---
it's ~**literally**~ the same thing. don't know about 3DS, but back in the DS era, shinies were based off the PID which in turn was tied to the pokemon's IVs. in a **very** simplified manner, you had a 1 in 31 chance multiplied by 0.03225 * 0.03225 * 0.03225 * 0.03225 to find a shiny, on top of other things.
---
it's a lot harder, but the logic is the same.
---
I'm a math person myself.
---
Your odds of getting a TSE are something like 1 for every 2 million 3* legendaries that you kill. That's why mathematicians have a hard time believing that someone could have them drop consistently.
---
Again.....just because something is not probable doesn't mean it's not possible.
---
RANDOM. In this situation no. Let me explain. In a game like Pokémon they give you a 1 in 1600 chance a pokemon will be shiny. In this game their is no given percent pool that items drop at. There is instances where you get drills or nothing at all. The drops are so inconsistant that no one is able to come up with a real percentile chance. It is. 100% random what you will get if anything at all. Stop throwing Your made up statistics around and link me to the page where Bethesda says what your chances are or just stop. You seem to think you know everything when you don't. Your numbers fall apart when Bethesda fails to be transparent about actual numbers and when it is 100% impossible to predict the item drop. I'm done. This is a waste of time because you are not listening to anyone but yourself. Get a job. 
---
I did not know that the limit was faction based (didn't think factions were legitimately separated out).
---
So vendor bots belonging to responders or raiders have separate sell limits and in combined total you've found 7 vendor bots with 200 caps that you can sell to?
---
They don't *all* revert to 0 caps after enough sells?  I run Watoga Station, Phoenix Bot at Watoga Shopping Plaza, the R&amp;G...or R&amp;B Station west of there.  Lewisburg Station (or whatever it's called just west again), then Welch Station, Stanton Station, Whitesprings Station and Resort, Pleasant Valley Station and the north ski resort vendor, then north towards Sunny something station and by then I'll have tun into 0 caps on anymore station vendors.  I'll make sure to check out the freestates vendor though from now on.
---
Honestly, EA has become much more engaged with the community since the Battlefront 2 fiasco. I know people don't want to hear this, cause there is no way EA isn't the embodyment of pure evil, but they revamped their entire communication and put in a new community manager /u/f8rge who is doing a great job so far.
---
1,500+ hours of gametime in BF2 + a lot of community time (until I got banned from the official forums for Jar Jar Binks sex jokes). So I know what Im talking about and EA is definitely trying at this point. And thats why I hope Bethesda gets their turning point and repairs FO76. If EA could do it, Bethesda can do it as well.
---
Great analysis!! I've had the game crash with no nukes and not crash during a fissure prime nuke event
---
Stop talking about pokemon. You are upset. Calm down. 
---
I'm currently on a break from FO76 myself but I haven't "deinstalled" or uninstalled it and I won't I still have hope for this game. That's not to say I don't have some complaints.
---
Whitesprings used to be awesome! High exp lots of Legendaries quick respawn rates oh wait your having fun here's a *nerf*
---
Exp from Super Mutants and robots was great for leveling up *nerf*
---
Watoga had a high level of legendary robots well we can't have that *nerf*
---
TSE's got duped and saturated the world people complained *Nerfed* now everyone who just had a 2 shot or explosive no longer has a good weapon. Despite the obvious problem being bobble head stacking and duping. Now Demolition expert seems like it should cost 3 points instead of 5 
---
Perks that were never exploited or complained about *nerfed* really Licensed plumber pipe weapons suck who cares let them have 90% durabilty, and White Knight didn't hurt anyone..... What pisses me off is they didn't announce these perk card nerfs prior to the patch because they knew we'd be furious. With all the talk about caring about player feedback this seems hypocritical.
---
We ask for easier availibility of plans Beth is like hell yeah great idea we can jack up the prices why not. Now you have to grind for caps for 5 days if you want calibrated excavator shocks.
---
Weapons used to last a lot longer before breaking. I'm not sure if this is a nerf or if they just fucked up the patch. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
FO76 was a lot more fun prior to the nerfs and thier new fascination with forcing us to grind for everything.
---
Bad part is I can deal with all of the above if they just release new content. This game was way too short and very incomplete when released. I've never played a Fallout which didn't have vaults open yet. Really a Fallout without vaults are you fucking kidding me!! I spent an hour trying to get into the first vault I came accross before I googled it and found out they're not finished yet!!!
---
Well it shows how much they rushed the release.... umm that and all the bugs, duping, and wonderful 90gb update on release day.
---
Sorry, that was a long reply and kind of bitchy but it felt good to get that off my chest.
---
Literally I farm Fort Defiance with Pharma Farma, it's a game changer for stocking up on aid for sure.
---
I hate having my camp /base destroyed but sadly it is a part of the game ( they even have a perk to help you destroy bases faster )  I kinda wish it was the slap system for bases where people did trivial damage unless your automated defenses shot them ( and if you didnt want your base fighting people you wouldn't put turrets or traps in it )  
---
Just don't add anything to the shop that gives you an advantage over players who don't buy anything. How difficult is this? Just cosmetic stuff, that's what we were told and now this we have this bullshit, because we believed Bethesda. Thanks for nothing.
---
Interact with him so he turns towards you. Forces a pathing change. Doesn't work everytime but it helps
---
Lol, that is beyond ludicrous. That might be the worst grind in the game. I hated roses questline. I cant imagine doing it a second time, much less a dozen, with a new character each time. Oh, and then find a reliable mule to get the plans over to my main
---
maybe I was incorrect about the mmo thing, but Bethesda was never interested in defining Fo76's genre themselves. probably because they still can't decide on it, seeing as how they're going for survival servers of all things now.
---
not to mention, you're picking on a non-issue. that's not even what this topic is about. but ok, like I said before, suit yourself. fact is, the rng is still messed up.
---
I was reading the other day about an Asteroid that has a 1 in maybe some 10's or 100s of thousands of chance of hitting the planet. Yet people beat those odds, even more extreme odds, every day when they win the lottery. As for loot. Some people have supposed that there is some kind of seed that is different on each server, which has a higher chance of certain items dropping. So if you find one legendary with a certain prefix, you have higher odds of finding another with the same prefix while on the same server possibly in the same area, or possibly server wide, though that part is unknown.
---
Don't fear higher level players. Scrap and bulk early.  Do the forest missions first and repeat the events to gain xp and to quickly level up.  Camp near water and build a water purifier as soon as you can. Speaking of camps, when you discover  the Whitespring Resort, you can camp on the golf course, but remember this, it gets nuked, a lot.
---
A camp is also a free fast travel point, so when you can, set up somewhere in the midle of the map.
---
Leaving the green circle before the full capture flags the owner for pvp, but doesn't give you ownership since you left the green circle when claiming causing it to fail.
---
Mobile Reddit is AIDS, so probably not. I mean the first quote you posted above regarding stealth changes, etc.
---
I like to power up Poseidon and Monongah then take over the Converted Munitions Factory, Red Rocket Mega Stop, and Grafton Steel. I run a rifleman/commando build alternating between using a 10mm submachine gun, automatic combat rifle, and gauss rifle, so I generally lock up the steel and lead resources at the workshops for my ammo crafting but build up the rest and leave them unlocked for other people to take stuff freely. Then I move on to events or quests (still haven't finished the main quest, level 60). 
---
It's a fun loop, I enjoy providing the free resources, it keeps me moving between areas looting and shooting, and also boosts the chance that I run into other randoms who show up for the defend workshop events. Every once in a while someone will try to takeover one of my workshops and I'll PvP until I am able to get them to leave or am forced to leave myself.
---
On the rare occasion I can play for multiple hours at a time I'll expand on this and try to hold as many workshops as possible, always building all the resource generators and leaving them unlocked.
---
Should have chosen the banker. He's from Boston you know.
---
3:  Bulk junk items can be sold. Certain junk items are worth 1-2c each (like antiseptic, fiberglass, gold, silver, etc). You can sell these to clean out a vendor of its 200c then move on to another vendor in a different pool (as mentioned there are 7, though the ones in Watoga and Harper’s Ferry might be dangerous and you can’t access Modus yet). Regardless, that’s 3 vendor pools for 600c a day. More if you venture into the more dangerous (for your level) locales. I’d advise against selling junk in those areas as it’s dropped on death.
---
Outfits are lightweight and also a good way to sell for caps. There’s tons scattered around Whitesprings.  
---
Taking over workshops can be rewarding. The camp on the dry lake has a silver deposit. Consider this a cap farm. Wade airport has 3 oil nodes. Bulked oil sells for a fair bit.  Sunshine has fertilizer deposits. Bulked fertilizer sells fairly well too. 
---
Alternatively you can farm weapons from Scorched to sell. 
---
Please dont start praising EA now just because they did one Ok-ish thing. Afaik we dont even know Anthems monetization yet. And EA had so many fuck ups in the last 10 years and have been one of the worst and greediest publishers out there. They see us consumers as cows they can milk any way they want. EA dont deserve praise. Two good recent releases means nothing. They still have to prove that they can be trusted again. 
---
I actually checked and realized being well fed and hydrated gives 50% disease resistance, and antibiotics give 50% disease resistance.
---
I thought longterm reliance on antibiotics caused the immune system to become suppressed or cause immunodeficiency?
---
This is awesome. Thanks!
---
But the exact number is unobtainable because of unknown variables that it's impossible to track which renders the item drops random. That's what I tried to tell him. It's calculatable when it comes to medical containers, or specific item containers in game but when it comes to something where nothing is a variable and at random times it basically makes it impossible to calculate. 
---
It's actually pretty basic math.
---
(Number of weapons)*(number of major legendaries)*(number of possible minor legendaries)*(number of 2nd minor legendaries)
---
The only things we don't know are the probability that a 3* legendary actually drops a 3* legendary and if the random number generator is actually random it if it's weighted towards certain drops.
---
Cool. When the nerfs came I was little suspisions of the huge intrest in AAs. I had mostly TS and some explosives so I was fucked either way.
---
Recently got my very first TSE radium rifle. Seems pretty decent, though the mods aren't great yet, no silencer and have to use powerful auto receiver which even when firing as little as possible, it has so huge recoil.
---
How much that 3 star TS xxx gauss does damage, about?
---
For most weapons AA is probably better but 20% of gauss damage might surprass the 50% of damage resistance of most high levels, though super mutants don't seem to have the best resistances. Also depends on if you mix it with anti tank perks.
---
You say promise like a child who’s mother owes them something. It’s pretty pathetic in this context.
---
Add in the unknown chance of an enemy dropping no legendary and come back to me with that math. Until then it's random. Not that hard to understand. 
---
I'm pretty sure I've gotten every variation of the Tire Iron.
---
I would say that I am shocked, but for some reason after the creation club bs, I am not shocked at all.
---
I was one of those who never used mods til about 3 years ago. They extend the life of games and in several cases fix games. I mean we could really use mods for most games, especially Triple A games.
---
You’re allowed to like bad movies.
---
Just don’t talk about them like they are anything else.
---
Yeah he was surprised for sure!
---
That's my luck all day long my friend. LoL I appreciate you taking the time to look homie. 
---
I could believe it, the only thing worse than IT customer support is plain simple Customer Support.  Does the customer even know what they're talking about?!  Bollocks.
---
i would argue the great customer service and community aspect is almost entirely Bioware, please let's not give EA credit where credit is not due
---
Ah, post nuke Whitespring.   Always good for a metric shit tonne of *worthless 1 Star* legendaries.  
---
You need to scrap many hundreds of armor pieces for RNG luck to give anything worthwhile, a slow and highly frustrating system.
---
The problem here is that all of the math assumes an unbiased RNG system.
---
Broad-spectrum antibiotics (which are the ones that help with most bacterial sicknesses) are also suppressing our own lactic acid bacteria, that play a major role in our intestinal immune system.
---
Good Lord, don't do that, you'll kill us all!
---
Yeah this. EA dont give a fuck. Theyre just a little bit nice right now because they had to admit that screwing over their customers over and over again is not good for their profits long term.
---
Yes in Skyrim I would always put the cool-effect magic items on display.
---
Obviously, you're a hacker.
---
Shall do once I have level 3 pharmicist, the only perk I still need and overlooked cause I didn't even know there were antibiotics for a good long while.
---
Lol that's strange, they don't give exp or loot.
---
I already stated that in the last paragraph.
---
It's starting to sound like you were the one arguing.
---
Honestly you should probably keep both of them. Furious stacks up insanely fast because of the fire rate so you can easily get maximum value from the effect. Executioners seems like almost a +20% damage increase over the default since you get +50% damage when the target is below 40% health. I can see Executioners being used more as finisher for tankier bosses like the SBQ.   
---
With Vault raids being announced for in the future, you might want to consider keeping both. Here are some reasons:  
---
\- Vaults will likely be close quarters combat for the most part, which the flamer excels at  
---
\- The flamer is an area of effect weapon dispersing damage and active effects to anything it touches  
---
\- Tenderizer increases target damage taken up to 7%  
---
\- Suppressor reduces target damage output by up to 30%  
---
\- Adrenaline stacks up to 60% damage  
---
\- bloody mess for +15% damage  
---
\- Stabilized for +45% armor pen  
---
\- One Gun Army for stagger and limb damage  
---
***- Friendly fire will heal your teammates if you burn them***
---
IF they ever make the durability better or fuel not horribly expensive to make these will be god-tier in raids. Four people running down a vault hallway spamming a deadly fire cloud that heals them.
---
are you listening to yourself? you're saying it's impossible to calculate the odds because we don't know the variables, even though the wiki lists those variables.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
that’s something a duper would say
---
That &amp; even undiseased my thirsts and hunger bars seem to be going faster. 
---
I believe we should be able to Salvage the Major &amp; Minor legendary mods from one item, and reuse them on other legendary Items, Prefix should remain fixed so as not to make everything too easy.
---
You should have to grind to some extent to get what you want.
---
The variable for an item not dropping at random? I've said it 8 different times now that that is what renders your argument moot. You need to listen. Or read. Wtf ever. Do you honestly not have anything better to do? 
---
And yet, so many times, I've been playing with my friends, and Death from Above starts, and we jump in our PA and we head over to the Blast zone, and run around having a blast of a time. And never get disconnected or have the server crash. 
---
Oh yeah, I get to play on the good servers. You must be a bad person, so they flagged your account for the bad servers. 
---
I’ve stopped doing this event, 1st time he grounded himself against a tree, 2nd time he got stuck on the edge of a house
---
I've been happily using my instigating explosive western for close to 2 months now. My best by damage and ammo is cheap.
---
You need good pistols if you are into pistols. Good thing is they don't weight 20 lbs or 25 when modded.
---
from what i have heard, both furious and anti-armor explosive are broken in that sense.  I have not seen the numbers either unfortunately.
---
Huh, antibio-tics, checks out and I feel dumb for never piecing it together.
---
It's weird, it sounds like softcore chemotherapy in a way, kills all the stuff, even the good stuff, but it's the dead bad stuff that matters.
---
&gt;In a game like Pokémon they give you a 1 in 1600 chance a pokemon will be shiny.
---
no, they don't. like I explained in my previous post, shinies are rolled based off their PID, which in turn is tied to the IVs. so you have a 1 in 31 chance multiplied by every other IV to roll a shiny, or 0.03225^5. on top of other things, of course.
---
&gt;In this game their is no given percent pool that items drop at. There is instances where you get drills or nothing at all. The drops are so inconsistant that no one is able to come up with a real percentile chance. It is. 100% random what you will get if anything at all.
---
just like pokemon.
---
&gt;Stop throwing Your made up statistics around and link me to the page where Bethesda says what your chances are or just stop.
---
I'll ask again: do you have a problem with logic? do you need me to link you to a study explaining why it's a good idea to breath as well?
---
this is a list of every possible legendary modifier. to get a rough estimate of the odds of rolling one, just dive and then multiply them.
---
Sorry. Honestly it was worded like that guy would have and at this point I'm just glancing over it. Sorry about that. But yeah it definetly still renders it random. I explained the same thing to him and we agreed in the top math but that bottom part he just doesn't seem to understand. Until we get the facts on that it does leave it completely random and we cannot determine anything. 
---
This happened to me a few times, but I can't recall if I was diseased or not. I just exited server I was good to go.
---
The only variable that is unknown is the exact probability of a 3* actually dropping a 3*. We can get a fairly close estimate if this number using collected data.
---
I'm not sure what you're arguing anymore.... LOL. You said you aren't a math guy.....yet you argue that the math is wrong?
---
Factor in the random no loot at all drop and get back to me bud. I'm done here.

---
&gt;A DICE ROLL. IS. NOT. RNG.
---
it's probability. the logic is the same.
---
&gt;If their is no set way items drop their is no way to determine the probability that they will give you certain items.
---
false. all you have to do is divide how many possible variables there are, and then multiply them. you'll get a rough estimate that's probably a lot higher than the final, actual value.
---
&gt;but with legendary weapons you have no real way to say "oh its this percent" because their are so many variables.
---
and we know at least 3 of them for a fact. so we can calculate based off that and extrapolate.
---
&gt; I've found AAE weapons Tse wepons and faster swing better heavy damage etc. Weapons withing ten minutes of each other. Do I just get very lucky or is it RANDOM?
---
both?
---
Flail around with a melee weapon. Seriously. Happened to me the other night. I kept flailing, then an xp notice and sound would pop up; still radiating, so I flailed some more and finally killed the invisible widget that was after me. Very weird. I just consider it a bee swarm with "too small for the nekkid eye" bees.
---
Everyone is dead. All the quests involving people are meaningless. It gets repetitive to go and read all those holotapes when at the end you know you're just going to find their bodies. NPCs made this franchise interesting

Not a bug (literally) have seen same animation play several times in whitesprings ghoul meatpiles when looting all items after a massacre (~5 minutes +/- after kill) or the meatpiles can just bug out and not vanish before good 15 minutes....
---
&gt; New late game content to be added. 0% SOLVED. I guess the much expected road map will bring light on this. 
---
I want to see bug fixed and improvements for at least the next four weeks before they think about adding new stuff that will 100 % be broken. They should fix the existing stuff first.
---
What part of the game do you wish to support? The bugs? The unfinished product? The rip off cash shop? The poor story? The shitty servers? The cheating? The duping? You want to support Bethesda so they can make another game like this?
---
I mean what exactly is there to support? Being screwed in the ass by another multi-national corporation? What kind of a person green lights this kind of shitty practice?
---
You sound like Trump if he were a film critic.
---
we can't do that because we don't know for a fact what that number is. you could extrapolate and say 50%, but legendaries not dropping items at all **seem** a lot rarer than 50%. all we can is extrapolate based off our personal experience.
---
what we can do however, is calculate based off **known** variables, such as the total number of legendary mods.
---
and I thought you were done a dozen posts ago.
---
Yeah, this is one of the events that I simply don't do. Takes too long, and there are too many issues.
---
The original design DID call for it to be squatting directly above the junk pile........ but the trees got in the way and I had to move it
---
\#4: Dedicated PVP area - hell yes. It would been much better implementation than what they are building right now for PVP.
---
\#2: Traditional AH - well yes, but not having it has its benefits. You have to go and talk to people, this makes people to socialize and not be robots.
---
\#3: more people - Well more people in server wont make it any better. It is good, not pumping into players at every quest location. Rather people encounters should been more meaningful, more dangerous, more existing. Every people I have met are these boring shallow characters. Take Rust, 90% times you see player, they will attack you and that gives you opportunity actually meat nice player, who is not going to kill you and help you. That one player is outweighing all the  "good" players in here, because he aint forced to be good, he chooses to be good and that what gives color to Rust playebase. Here, everything is boring grey.
---
Well for some events bigger player count per server would make things easier, but those events (PVP events, H/H) should be somehow instanced and have ques across all the servers.
---
\#1: not having NPC, not much of problem. 
---
If it makes sense to call you a liar for claiming to have found a TSE weapon, then it makes sense to call someone a liar for claiming to have found any specific weapon with any number of stars. 
---
Don't let people who are bad at math get to you.
---
An initiation system for camps would be pretty ideal for those not wanting to partake in pvp factors of the game. Or a setting to make yourself immune from pvp things. But then their are cons that could arise from that. Blocking spawns etc.  I  never seen the point of destroying someone's camp for pleasure or whatever reason ppl do it. I'm just glad they were still happy with the help I gave them. 
---
Got it. Thanks. 
---
I just linked proof of known variables. you can calculate based off that. what else you want me to say?
---
I'm saying that their are more variables than the modifiers, you have the weapons, armor, the three different legendary effects and every form of them, (this I where the whole thing falls apart) the chance that you can get a drop at all, the chance a drill will drop, the chance a 3* enemy will drop a 3* item, the chance a legendary enemy will drop a legendary item at all. Those all make this process impossible to calculate. I said I'm not a math guy. Not someone who doesn't understand it. You can't solve an equation when half the equation is unable to be found. 
---
I think it's less the amount of stash space we have, and more how it's structured.
---
For example, if our stash had fields for materials. Like steel, rubber, lead, etc that maxed out at 500. If you want to store more than 500 steel in your stash then you would need to bulk it, and now it's eating up your regular stash space.
---
That would go a long way is solving the storage problems.
---
That's not real numbers then. 
---
I practically stopped grinding for legendaries due to how futile is to expect a specific item type with specific legendary effects. There are several factors at play here. 
---
First, before the December 4th patch, legendaries did drop items with as many stars they had. Now they don't and also they are less likely to spawn too.
---
Second, if one runs in a PA, half of the loot pool is regular armor, which is practically useless. Rarely, I find an armor which has additional effects I'd switch to (i.e., 1\* regenerating -&gt; 2\* regenerating + strength).
---
Third, the loot drop doesn't seem to be properly tiered/location bound, and often confirmed bugged (SBQ). For example, in some other game, you know a particular enemy has a 5% chance of dropping a specific item you want and you keep going back to try your luck. Here, I think any enemy can drop anything but the pool is so large you have 0.5% chance of at least getting the right type of item with 1\*. That is, you have to kill, on average, 200 legendaries at least and actually get a legendary drop from them.
---
&gt; literally ever worked in a professional position
---
Literally? As opposed to figuratively?
---
You... bought no mans sky twice?
---
I want you to admit that their are variables we can't determine that render the equation unsolvable withought Bethesdas proof that their is a certain percent for things to drop. Until then I'm not convinced and I did get all of my Tse, aae, and other good weapons legit. Without caps being spent or money. 
---
~~evil~~
---
Incompetent.
---
Maybe now that no one plays the game they can spare some server space for you
---
I agree for the most part except if you play for 10 hours straight you should have at least something of value. This goes back to the issues with legendary creatures not dropping any legendary loot. As well as players receiving the same “random” loot drops. I have had the same exterminator left arm combat armor drop multiple times in the whitesprings parking lot. Yet never had a TSE weapon drop. Or even any explosive weapon drop at level 101. For comparison on my first play through of fallout 4, I found an explosive combat shotgun by level 40. Your idea of duped weapons throwing off the statistics to the rest of the drops actually seems very plausible to me but I am not a programmer so the fuck do I know. 
---
It's infested with rad roaches especially in closets, or "employee only" rooms. 
---
Yeah... I was blinded by the idea of it. I regret those decisions now but only after 100+ hours each time. After that... Yeah. Want to see the same 6 variations of planets? Found an unknown planet called lucifer and then the power went out at my house when I was flying towards it. Logged back on and never saw it again. Sean Murray knew I was onto something. 
---
you're literally arguing against math and probability now. that's how wrong you are.
---
something being random doesn't mean we can't calculate the odds. that's what probability is all about. the more variables, the less likely it is.
---
and even though we don't know most of the variables, we do know 3 for a fact: the number of prefixes, major and minor effects. and if those net to 0.0006% (pardon me but I forget the exact number), it's safe to say the actual odds are much, much lower than that.
---
I don't see why they can't make paints for all armour types, might have bought it if I could put it on my combat armour. 
---
I gather a lot on my daily travels, every trip to Watoga nets me around 35 stimpaks, 25 Cans of Dog food, and lots of other stuff I don't need, but can't stop picking up anyway, so I just give lots of stuff away.
---
A lot of lower level players run away when I approach them (I understand), so one of my daily chores is to drop stuff in the Overseers Cache boxes,
---
Lately I have been building level 5 Studded Leather Armor, and BOS Recon rifles, and dropping them for newbies, just to get them off to a good start.
---
My hope is that this type of cooperative game play will encourage others to do the same, and eventually make this a game where griefers move on to something else.
---
Thank you, I didnt realize that....
---
They did but you couldn't do anything other than roam around and do VIP missions. So anything involving the bikers, CEO, or gun running missions would have to be done in freemode.
---
&gt;I want you to admit that their are variables we can't determine that render the equation unsolvable
---
that is factually untrue. read my last reply. at the very least we can calculate the most basic odds based off known variables. and it only gets worse from there, the more variables are known.
---
&gt;Until then I'm not convinced and I did get all of my Tse, aae, and other good weapons legit. Without caps being spent or money. 
---
I don't really care either way.
---
I agree with that 100%.
---
The problem is that the variable where a legendary doesn't drop anything never increases your probability of getting a god roll, it decreases the probability.
---
Again I'm not arguing that it's impossible for someone to have good RNG luck..... I'm just on the boat of it being highly improbable.
---
They're just a small indie company. They obviously don't have the resources
---
I don't think it would be a bannable offense I just thought about it and didn't know if anyone had tried it. And I think that guy just wants to be a proper salty turd.
---
I'm saying there are unknown variables that you can't determine.. I'm done arguing you are not listening. You can't have a×b×C×d×? ×¿×¿×? =E it just doesn't work that way. E being your made up number. Abcd being the ones we know and ? ¿ Being things we CANNOT calculate and it's all well and good to extrapolate but in things based on facts you don't extrapolate. Extrapolating gets people killed irl. Do you think in rocket science when they have unknown variables they just.. Idk. Make some shit up and extrapolate and just say "that's a fact!"

Few of my experiences:
---
\- There seems to be some auto-aiming with stabilized 3 which somehow improves my hit chance on distant enemies with imprecise aiming. In contrast, sometimes when the environment is in the way or the enemy is very close, hip-fire will shoot at ridiculous angles to the left or right.
---
\- There is no crosshair in aim mode for some reason, but my gun sometimes glitches when aiming down the sights and the crosshair remains on screen. This is especially great with SB &amp; SBQ as my gun has +10% damage when aimed.
---
\- It is a preference, but I really enjoy the Vampiric effect on the gun as it keeps me healing while mobs attack me or the SBQ melees me. 
---
\- Cards I use: Heavy gunner, Stabilized, Martial artist, Gunsmith, Adrenaline, Bloody mess
---
I'm going to offer the same boring advice I always do, but here goes.
---
In terms of 2 and 3, you may need to grind a bit, but at that level I made a certain run that I felt worked well. Go to Charleston and hit the newspaper building. Low level scorched in there (sometimes ghouls) and multiple typewriters and things with springs, which are great for all types of crafting. If you follow the arrows into the next building, there's a few more items with screws and no enemies. Backtrack and head up the hill to Wade Airport. You don't need to enter the airport main building at all, just head out to the tarmac/runway area. Level 5 super mutants that you can mostly pick off from a distance (they'll mostly be carrying hunting rifles that you can scrap for mods). There is a metric ton of junk in the smaller buildings (a lot of it scraps to steel) so collect all that. Now either go to the Charleston Station and/or wander over to Flatwoods to scrap everything (don't forget to check the motel gym room for lead). You now have plenty of scrap to either bulk and sell or use to craft mods for your weapons and/or ammo. I frankly never really bother with buying things from vendors unless it's super useful like the handmade gun (aka rifle) plans.
---
I've gotten most of my plans either by doing the quests and/or taking over a workshop (clear out workshop, claim it, lay down turrets (preferably elevated), hide somewhere nearby to avoid PvP, let the turrets defend and reap the rewards). 
---

---
You can do that with any fight scene and break it down to make it look bad. They're not meant to be analyzed frame by frame.
---
Absolutely. There was talk when the game first came out that it was also world seeds or server side of where the items would drop. I remember grinding in lobbies for hours and finding nothing including my friends doing the same, then I server hop because the loot was garbage and then find (the instance on trial here apparently) 3 explosive weapons back to back with 3 * modifiers.

---
Thankyou! that falls into subs I didn't know existed. 
---
Good point on 3 many people in same quest location making same quest rushing place to place can brake the immersion of the quest and can make it to feel more like some sort of roleplaying action camp lol (thats what rune sometimes felt like especially in holiday events or new quests full of people) and okay if server had a gap of 1000 players just imagine the amount of C.A.M.Ps! The world would start to look like fuckin minecraft server full of wooden crappy looking boxes) but atleast like 20 more players would make it better imo especially if factions come out and there would be wars between them.

You can collect dirty water from streams (i.e., Flatwoods) faster, like 100 a minute just by spamming R on PC. There is no animation wait or game throttling currenlty and I haven't noticed any server lag.
---
I think the live, laugh, kill sign is better than usual. I'll probably grab it once they expand the camp budget. 
---
You're right it's so unfair, please take this time to list for us some of the things Bethesda has done to show that they care about their customers. The floor is yours:
---
I get around 120 plastic in Morgan town high.
---
Because when one idiot buys pink paint for metal armor they know that same idiot will buy purple paint for their pipe pistol on a different day. And so on.
---
Well to be clear I wouldn't give up on the whole franchise, that for me would be madness. But I'd rather give 76 a chance by giving it a rest until the most frustrating bits are out of the way. Because I still have a lot of enthusiasm for the game - in its right element.

and yet, I keep getting autostim wood chest pieces and vampyric lead pipes.

&gt;I'm saying there are unknown variables that you can't determine..
---
read my lips: THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM
---
&gt;You can't have a×b×C×d×? ×¿×¿×? =E it just doesn't work that way.
---
it does. problems in that vein are actually quite common in high school.
---
&gt;it's all well and good to extrapolate but in things based on facts you don't extrapolate. Extrapolating gets people killed irl.
---
&gt;Do you think in rocket science when they have unknown variables they just.. Idk. Make some shit up and extrapolate and just say "that's a fact!" 
---
they actually do. when a value is impossible to determine, the next best thing is approximating, extrapolating.
---
listen, you seem to have a better grasp now than before, so I'll simplify the current issue: even if we can't factually determine the actual value, that's irrelevant.
---
the 3 known variables are the legendary mods. 1 in 23, 1 in 7 and 1 in 9. fact. so if you multiply them it nets us 0.0006%. that's the factual, non-extrapolated odd of rolling a specific 3\* and **nothing else**, which means I'm not accounting for unknown variables such as whether a legendary mob actually drops a legendary. so, **at the very least**, we can confirm, factually, that the odds of rolling a god legendary are 0.0006%.
---
and that's the beauty when it comes to percentage. we don't need to know for sure what the odds are because it only gets worse from here, fact. whatever the number is, you'll have to multiply it by 0.0006%. which is only gonna make the odds worse.
---
for example, and this is a variable that we **CAN** factually check, there's something like 40 possible ranged weapons variations. so if you multiply it by the above number, the odds are reduced to 0,000015%.
---
I honestly thought they were doing a better job than most so far with all the feminine outfits. Of course it's always a good thing to see more!

Hunting rifle. Easy to acquire for scrapping to unlock mods. Hits hard for nice sneaky crits.

I would say it’s a survival game considering it’s effectively survival mode from fallout 4 online. And for reference I had an explosive combat shotgun drop by level 40 in fallout 4. I’m level 101 now with no TSE or even explosive weapon drops. Is that enough time grinding to expect a TSE or even an explosive weapon? Are you saying you are receiving 3* drops from every 3* enemy? Are your bodies to loot not disappearing randomly before you can loot them? These are just some of the issues I n may others have been facing while playing this game. The loot system is broken in this game n you aren’t doing anything of use saying this isn’t a problem. 
---
Ya welcome! also I just realized i spelt it wrong but I fixed it.
---
I heard even fifa wasnt doing as well as they wanted to. 
---
You should probably understand that this game, this sub in particular has a very strong casual player following. Players who are playing 1-2 hours a week of Fallout 76. To these people, using their own experiences, finding TSE weapons is incomprehensible.
---
It's important to realize that their exceedingly small playtime leads them to make incorrect assumptions about game mechanics because they are still inexperienced with them. Don't hate them for their lack of knowledge, if they refuse to see reason just gotta move on. They'll figure out out in their own time, maybe another 8 months.

Extrapolating is just guessing. That's not how this works. I'm done here.

It happens all the time and is a known bug currently [investigated](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback) by the developers. Check enemies killed after and they may have the missing drop.

&gt;I received a total of 1 mod the BOS Combat Arm or some such thing can't remember the name exactly, my Heavy Combat Armor is already moded with BOS so why that would unlock again confuses me.
---
I don't think the BOS mods for the armors are unlocked by scrapping, but there is a BOS paint mod for the Combat Helmet that can be unlocked by scrapping Combat Armor randomly.  That may be what you saw.
---
Armor scrapping mod learning is very low chance.  And the more mods you have unlocked the less likely it seems to be to get one.  Nothing like Weapons which are very quick for the most part.  I don't think there are any perks to help it, other than ones like Super Duper, Scrapper, and Armorer to make it cheaper/faster to craft.

I hope this is a joke. Please don't encourage the gaming industry to continue this trend. Leave the pay to shut to the kids playing Fortnite

It is a feature, which I would really like to have a lot more at Whitesprings. All those empty meat piles left by the previous player is kind of a distraction.

lvl 155 atm, my stash is normally at around 400-450 lb's and any higher than that means I'm stashing a load of weapons just in case they get buffed, or what I just killed a player and stole 400lb of junk that I'm waiting to sell for caps, so honestly you just need to learn to manage your inventory better, look up what items you need and what you don't need and then prioritize space and junk based on availability and demand

I'm not, though. I just showed you that, even without every variable, we can calculate part of the equation. the part which we know, for a fact, what the variables are.
---
the problem that you're ignoring is that, no matter what the unknown variables actually are, they'll only make things worse. the odds really are close to 0.000001%.
---
&gt;I'm done here.
---
you said you were done about a dozen times now. stop, it's silly.
---
Love skyrim too but there's one major glitch/bug that annoys me to death and really puts me off playing it again.
---
On ps4 there's a bug that prevents you from saving your game, it says you havnt enough memory when you have a crap ton. ( no mods installed too so it can't be that)
---
Fans of the Mass Effect series know exactly how little Bioware cares about the fans of their games.
---
An initiation system for camps would allow people to build rooms without doors to trap players.
---
Considering the game hasnt launched yet they are on a charm offensive second to none considering the general 'meh' feedback from the Beta....
---
So yeah wouldnt read much into it...see how they are when the game launches and gets the same Bethesda level of bashing. They will be hiding behind their community managers in no time.
---
This has to be the one event that seems to always be going on...
---
"I read it on the Internet, so it must be true." - Todd Howard, invisible fallen god.
---
Sounds like a great time, yeah I never know what I’ll find at camp when I fast travel back there, most of the time nothing, but I’ve had wolves on my second floor, or a few anglers trying to destroy my camp, or just some super mutants, keeps it interesting doesn’t it!
---
Same!!!!! PLEASE BETHESDA GODS HEAR US! 
---
As much contempt as I have for Fallout 76, fuck Anthem, and EA
---
You know it's funny how people are still defending this game by saying this is not a fallout game this is "inventory management 2018/2019" and that's a good thing. Stop complaining about what the game is. Like someone told me complaining about this game is like complaining fire is hot. Wtf.
---
Same problem here, will definitely try it, thanks!
---
So you guys will stop posting bullshit like this as of Bethesda is going to rework their entire engine just to make redditors happy it’s unrealistic. I highly doubt they’re going to change anything considering they’re working on elder scrolls and a completely new title. Fallout in general could be dead 
---
You're duplicating your efforts. You only need to go to one vendor of each faction. And yep, I'm certain.
---
4 legendarys at white springs today with no loot. Kinda hurts as a casual player but keeping the faith blindly I guess.
---
how do you know that bethesda doesnt care?
---
It is definetly the paint job for the helmet. I had this discussion in at least two other threads.
---
But you can learn stabilised from scrapping, so just keep on scrapping. And by the way, it doesn't matter if you scrap arms or legs. You can learn all the learnable mods from scrapping either of those.
---
Good luck and may RNG be with you :) 
---
Bethesda wanted to make a quick money with assets flips. They mostly don't care about bugs and issues. Fallout 4 has till today many many issues, which modders desperately try to fix and find workarounds. Fallout 76 is not different. They are unable to fix their game. Modders always did the work for them. They will shit out new DLCs and Atom Shop items and that's it.
---
Oops
---
I was very underwhelmed with the items this week. But I understand that it's style and opinion based. I personally would like a whole lot more power armor skins. Especially for the Excavator. Would also like a larger volume of new emotes and poses. 
---
I never get to fast travel, ever! I walk everywhere.....
---
It was published by EA. That has nothing to do with the developers. They're incredibly passionate. Do you know who Bethesda uses for their publisher? Bethesda. 
---
Sever instability is very case by case. I've not had a problem in ages.
---
They have been releasing updates earlier on pc. Then giving chance for bugs before consoles
---
Agreed and very well put. I don't want to believe the others comments but the complete disconnect between players and the dev studio has really got me believing that they have given up as well. I'm sure they will finish their vaults and do as little as possible just to keep the game *barely* playable. Beth has proved in these last few months what I have always suspected, FO is just the bastard child to Beth, all they really care about is ES. 
---
Amen!
---
I have tweaked the hell out of my character. Nerd rage, bloody mess, mutations, 3x3 of the slugger perks. solar powered and some other crap I cant recall. my strength averages at 35, but I have gotten it to 56. This does come with the down side of my character being a bit of a glass cannon. 
---
Keep Sanjay away from me please. Idc if you even take him to your camp. He is now your property and shall never be heard by me again
---
Some dudes invited me to their team randomly. Gave each of them a lion statue and other statues throughout their camps while they were powering up Poseidon. Good fun. Free material for them when they dismantle em. 
---
Same reason why Bioware halfassed Mass Effect Andromeda and then said they were shelving the franchise until after Anthem came out, right?  Just a small indie developer who couldn't possibly work on two games at once.  
---
They left every plot thread on a cliffhanger, blatantly teased the next game at the end of the story campaign, and shelved the franchise because *they care so much about the fans of their games*
---
I’m a woman IRL 
---
In my 60+hours I've not ran into an infinite health mob. 
---
Never thought about this. I like it! We could launch a mini nuke and farm a small amount of flora. This would be great for crafting when there aren't any nuke zones when you're playing which seems to be more often than not.
---
They vanish if there isn't anything in the inventory to grab. It clears up memory otherwise the servers would lag if there were piles laying all over the place. It's not a bug
---
If you try to highlight directly from the comment it collapses the thread. It's annoying as hell. Thank you by the way. I aim for them to be as floppy as a bunny's ears! 21 year old grammies ftw 
---
Honestly, they need to turn the servers off and do a FFXIV! 
---
Pacifist mode should embody the the definition of pacifist. If it's on, I don't want to target players. AND they should NOT be able to damage my camp. I opt to COOP, not PVP. 
---
That’s also part of the lore of Fallout.  We can become raiders.  Did you play the Nukaworld dlc for fo4?  Did you blow up Megaton in fo3?
---
the whole area is a camp...a weird experiment from another fallout base to see what happens after the apocalypse 
---
&gt; the game will never sell well, so what's the point in properly supporting it? 
---
That is my fear. 
---
With the bad press and everything, this game will not sell many more copies, even at the current super discounted prices, so DLCs, with so reduced base game will not be profitable to produce, unless they are already developed.
---
Don't worry, they're "looking into it."^^^TM
---
Well you won’t get it
---
I helped a nice lady launch her first nuke. She thought it was going to be some horrible experience. Turns out I'm a pretty good guide. Was fun. 
---
I know I won't. As soon as I saw they were selling paint for a **single** weapon type for $5, I knew that the Atom Shop wasn't for me.
---
He claims to be over 1k hours in. I honestly do play casual for the most part. 3-5 hours a week and alot less now than before. 
---
I wouldn't bother with Lock &amp; Load or Luck Of The Draw - both are garbage perks, take Blocker instead.  With Marsupial, you reload the gatling almost instantly anyways.  Gunsmith 5 should help enough with the extra wear on the two shot but I'd say its more needed just so you can mod on the prime receiver (and other gatling mods I believe needs Gun 4) if you wanted to.  And Tenderizer and Adrenaline doesn't have to be maxed out, the first level provides the largest portion of their benefits, unless you absolute insist on min/maxing.
---
I mean this isn’t any different than complaining I’m just saying don’t waste your energy with Bethesda you’re not going to convince them to completely change the game just because you typed it on reddit. I haven’t seen devs respond to any real changes (that are thought out like this) only small QoL things and obviously weapons nerfs etc. but I’m still seeing server stability complaints, in fact I’ve seen them everyday since beta. Like I said fo76 is a flop it’s not a big deal because the other fallouts are all highly re-playable...76 just fails as a fallout which was expected, since its online. But for an online multiplayer game you can’t honestly sit here and tell me it’s good. 
---
Long story short, Bethesda half assed their own game and they’re just milking Bethesda diehards who will spend 700 hours picking up resources and not complain because “I just want to explore XD” 
---
They should port all the cosmetics over from the Creation Club. I paid for em. I'd like them in this game. Copy and paste Bethesda, COPY AND PASTE!
---
I know what you mean, but then again in the last 3 days I found 2x aae handmade and 2x aa/swing speed drums. The probability of that happening is crazy low. 
---
talk about one-sided.
---
&gt;Someone says all Tse weapons are duped,
---
never said that.
---
&gt;I say I have had 6 in my playthrough not to mention the other just plain explosive weapons that I've given to friends. Random person says that bs
---
what actually happened is that you didn't read my post thoroughly. I was talking about god rolls, not TSEs. except you didn't specify *you* were talking about TSEs and not god rolls, so I assumed you *were talking about god rolls*. and what I said, verbatim, was that "I found that (rolling 6 god rolls) hard to believe".
---
&gt;and that I have a. 00001? Chance of getting a 3* Tse weapon from a random drop
---
it's closer to 0.000001%.
---
&gt;and that I obviously am lying and bought them from someone.
---
I never outright accused you of lying. again, I said I found your story hard to believe unless you had bought them. which is something I believe you yourself never brought up (buying and selling and whether you did it). not to mention this point is moot since, at the time, I thought we were talking about god rolls, not TSEs. I totally believe you rolled 6 random TSEs and I envy your luck.
---
&gt;50 comments later the person is still throwing this statistic around
---
because you still fail to understand it. people in this very thread seem to agree with me but there you go again, digging in your heels and shutting outside noise away.
---
&gt;and saying "you want me to say it to your face"
---
&gt;this kind of toxicity drives me away from subs.
---
it's funny because you were the one who originally said *"you wouldn't say that to my face"*
---
&gt;one of my first times commenting on something here in weeks and it turns into another one sided argument
---
probably because math isn't subjective.
---
&gt;noted that this person says they've logged 1k hours and still just bashes the game anytime they can
---
I did, yeah. close to that. doesn't mean I'm gonna pretend the game isn't busted.
---
I need some video proof i still think people are noobs, because there are too many claimed problems that never happened to me in 450hours gameplay.
---
It's just one guy. Leave him alone.
---
&gt; Ammo barely makes a dent in weight.
---
If you spend the points on Bandoleer, Batteries Included, etc. 
---
im so desperate for more stash space, i'll pay for it w atoms or even $$$.  THERE i said it even at risk of being downvoted lol
---
For the love of all that is holy please make this change
---
Some people said you can get it as uranium fever so savage divide events. I am still waiting to get it too. 3agility is mutch.
---
How do u exspect me to video something like this? Further more why on earth would i make something like this up if i was clearly enjoying the game enough to get the the point of unique cosmetics and max tier armour.
---
I got baboozled and used atoms (free thankfully) to buy a power armor skin for my excavator. 
---
Well that one doesn’t apply apparently.
---
Ah well.
---
First used car I bought i got reamed on too.
---
They should have separate pve and pvp beta servers with no cap and see how it is. Keep the perk card levels where they are and no more nerfs. 
---
Didn't say "you wouldn't say it to my face". When I'm off work I'll screencap it and then link it to imgur. I'm screencapping it now so you can't go and edit it out. 
---
Lol nah man these are in the atomic shop right now.
---
Need to shut down the game for 2 years and do a reboot
---
Battlefront II. I bought it on day 1, after one year it's a game I'm very proud of. u/ReturnOfTheLastJedi , your name tells me a lot!
---
Wait !!!!  Where is this Nuka Cola Vendor ?? 
---
Yes we want more space for our legendaries and our junk. A 600 limit is just ridiculous for a game based on weapons, armors, ammo and crafting.
---
The whole "server performances" excuse is pathetic for me: we paid for the game, they have enough money to get things done just right.
---
If I have to think badly, this excuses are made just for creating a virtual scarcity for selling us boots through micro-transactions in the future. That's why they are so swift in fixing farming, duplication and  grinding bugs and they don't care about a truly enjoyable game experience for the user.
---
Yeah, I can tell you that spontaneously disappearing items has never happened to me.
---
What *has* happened?  Hitting drop or selling them accidentally and I fortunately happen to catch myself doing it.
---
Thanks mindlessASSHOLE. It's nice to see that you're not mindless at all.
---
Several of my friends gave moved onto other games, so I've decided to help out new and low level players as much as possible to get them the best start possible.
---
I've made serums, weapons and I've crafted several sets of level 25 Excavator Power Armour, and fully modded them for low level players for free. I want them to not worry about carrying capacity and focus on having as much fun as possible so the Appalachia doesn't feel as deserted as it has been since the great nerf. 
---
Rifle, it uses commando 
---
The good news is that some day you will kill that scorchbeast, and it will drop a spare wagon axle.
---
They can kill you in passive mode anyway.
---
Also, why bother going to a workshop to defend it if you never took it? The other guy can have it for all I care, it's not like I lost anything, and I don't want to participate in PvP either
---
You mean 500atoms - three days plaing hour daily doing challenges, don't you?
---
There are 60 legendary effects. So you have a 1/60 chance of getting a Two shot legendary. There are 7 ranged effects for the second legendary spot. 1 is Exploding. So 1/420 chance out of 2 or 3 star weapon drops. I don't have any proof of the rate of 2 or 3 stars compared to 1 star but I'd say 1/6 of legendaries drop 2 or 3 stars on the high end as an estimate.  So that is 1/2520. So that is 0.0004 or 0.04%. On the Low end I'd say 1/20. That would be 1/8400  which is 0.00012 or 0.012%. So somewhere between 0.012%-0.04%. If you figure you'd get 5 legendaries on average at the golf club, that'd be 500-1680 per TSE on average.
---
That's why you never diss Terry 
---
Maybe we need a friends group of grumpy, old dudes. Not saying I'm old, but I played Pac Man when it was new.  This story is much better than my schreechy kid experiences have been. 
---
The game has been out for, what, 11 weeks? They've patched bugs. They've mass banned a ton of cheaters that were ruining server integrity and in-game economy. They've announced content updates. Unless they break their promise of not charging for new DLC, I think $60 is a pretty good value for what I've played so far, and I'm looking forward to what's coming in the future. I applaud their community manager for having to deal with (since day one) the most toxic hatred campaign I've seen around a game in recent memory.
---
Looking at that guy's post, he must be going through some stuff. Condolences, SuperMega. 
---
The 420 by your name leaves open the obvious possibility of user error.
---
Are you sure? I thought it use guerilla for 10mm smg.
---
But other smg (thompson) is comando.
---
hunting rifle is poor for a slugfest you described.  its accurate and should be used for sniper(sneak) duty only.  soon as it sees you, you should have switched to something more hard hitting.  also as said you didnt mention any drugs, you shoulda popped a pyscho etc before engaging.  im not even melee but if i see one land, i'll be going in w my allrise.  
---
They should replace VATS with the hunting combat system from Oregon Trail, it would save me ammo and get me more food.
---
2/10 times, it gets stuck on door/rock/signs... waste of caps.
---
ive seen that before. also saw an army of eyebots in the golf club after the nuke zone ended
---
So that means that it doesn't exist? I love comments like this, fully discrediting others' experience. 
---
Well, the playerbase is dropping daily. If servers r still up after 1 year, I will be genuinely surprised. Plenty of REAL MMOs shutter after 1 year due to lack of players. Bethesda doesn't really care, despite "their" posts on this sub. Yes, I highly doubt those r real devs posting on here. You dont agree? Prove it. This isn't coming from a place if saltiness. It's coming from a place of betrayal from what used to be my favorite dev, but is now at the very bottom of the list.
---
It seems like you are trying to prove that it’s okay that the loot system is broken cuz it’s randomly giving you loot. However, I’ve had some statistical anomalies in my looting. I have randomly been awarded the same exterminator left combat arm from the legendary ghoul in whitesprings parking lots at least 3 times now. That’s the same creature on several different days dropping the exact same loot. I’m level 101 n have had zero TSE or even an explosive weapon drops. I understand by definition this is acting randomly but people are trying to figure out what’s wrong with the loot drops n it seems like you’re more interested in proving this guy wrong than trying to improve the game. 
---
100%. Damage goes up with commando. Guerrilla only affects auto energy pistols, auto 10mm pistols, auto pipe pistols. 
---
It's weird that the Rage 2 deluxe edition response was quick and concise.  Sure it's not the same studio, but it's the same publisher.  Like night and day.
---
Two days ago the Apex Legends servers went down while I was playing with a friend. It took us about a minute to realize that the servers went down, and then I jumped on their Twitter feed to see if I could get any info. Lo and behold 53 seconds ago they tweet that they are experiencing server issues and will update us as needed. A few hours later they have another tweet with a new update. During that time people are responding to their tweet and the account is responding back, not to everyone, but to a lot more players than I expected.
---
This is a perfect example of what should be going on right now with Bethesda. Really great customer service, and a high level of interaction with your community, both make it a lot easier for players to have faith in a game and the direction it's heading. With these large gaps in communication, and no real consistency in when to expect updates or content it makes it a lot harder to stay excited about the game through adversity.
---
Title says it all
---
That doesn't really answer the question though.
---
I am inclined to agree with all your points. 
---
Fun until it destroys your base while you are repairing for the 20th time. I love e this game but it needs tweaking. 
---
Starting out I was walking into one of the towns and there was the crazy altercation between a traveling group of super mutants I’d been following and a bunch of ghouls. Just as the super mutants finished them off a scorchbeast flew in and started attacking, I thought it was such a cool little random event and wondered if I wasn’t there to see it if it still would’ve taken place. I ran like a coward, but a living coward.
---
PS4?
---
Plus the Capital Wasteland Project is back on, plus Cascadia, plus Miami... I have a feeling that Fallout 4 modding is only getting started. 
---
I understand that math. All I was saying was that (you did the math on some of the unknown variables such as whether or not it would drop a 3* when you kill one) on the subject of enemies just not dropping an item at all is where the math gets impossible. Just because there is no 1 in 10 or 1 in 100 it is undoubtedly random because it can't consistently be reproduced. I've done 100% of the damage to an enemy and got nothing. Not even junk. 
---
This way it would give a use to mini nukes?  Mini nukes already have a use.  The fat man is pretty good if you play explosives though pretty useless otherwise.  The problem is weight.  I could mass craft mini nukes, I'd just have trouble carrying them all even with ordinance express to reduce them to a tenth of their weight.
---

---
Because when you are 300lvl, you are 300caps reward.
---
This is actualy smart idea, there already are people who will send one guy to you, second guy claims your workshop (trigger pvp), first guy kills you, they both get 150caps. Second guy start claiming again (because he didnt finish it, so you are still owner) and first guy kills you again.
---
With this tactic, he gets workshop, invite you in group, turn of game, gets back on server cause u are in team with him, he leaves and now you are workshop owner and they can caps farm kill you.
---
That's a part of their job, and why they deserve our respect (and sympathy): take heat from the community so the bosses don't have to deal. Also, it's not like Todd Howard is spending his time trawling Reddit for patch ideas. 
---
In an ideal organization, those closest to the community are empowered to flag priority issues and help guide post-release support and direction. In poorly run companies, the opposite is true - the community manager position is considered junior and not given the proper respect (in a structural way). 
---
A lot of the problems that we've seen with Bethesda's post-release support for Fallout 76 aren't about rushed development or bad code - they're the inevitable result of structural failures and bad management. Even great businesses can make bad decisions, but only bad management makes you unable to recover.
---
I mean, I know Blizzard is no bueno these days because of Diablo Immortal (and the second D3 expansion they never made), but look at how they rebuilt Diablo 3 into one of the best ARPGs ever. That's because the company empowered the right people to make big, tough decisions (like killing the RMAH) and responded properly to community concerns. Even if your first release is a disaster, you can always salvage anything - as long as you have the right kind of organization and management. 
---
I feel like those are the easiest money they could make in power armor skins. *Especially* excavator where there are no in game paints, seems like that'd be an obvious cash grab for them. 
---
http://imgur.com/a/sqUM7io there is him saying it 8 hours ago before I said screw this. I have to be up at 5am.
---
No it is that they are a rare bug that only happens once in a blue moon. 
---
"Very odd"?
---
One time I was in just my underwear trying to get radiated faster in an attempt to get a mutation, when I heard a team of 3 approaching.  I don't use a mic.
---
I heard one of them say, "Why is he in just his underwear?"  I ran up to them and waved, they waved back, then I took out my fat man and killed myself by shooting it at my feet.
---
Obviously they were confused, I laughed to myself.  Then when I came back, I got dressed and they invited me onto their team and I ran around with them for a while.
---
Yep, there it is. You people carp at me for criticizing the game without playing it, and now you're criticizing the people that have played it and complain. Total hypocrisy!
---
And why can't I sell ammo? Ffs
---
Im honestly not playing until I see this has been patched. No one wants to play a game and be worried about loosing items. 
---
The Morgantown airport has tons of stims/drugs and sometimes you can get the quest thats there (you take care of some low level scorched and get a air drop)
---
But yea, i love this community. Except for the raiders-they can choke on a chode
---
In fo4 you could just spam it and be good. Even if you had to let it catch up lol
---
Exactly! It's THE most worn power armor, at least from what I have observed in nearly 600 hours of playing. Easy money. 
---
Then don't accept random team invites?
---
Leave the team and swap servers?
---
that also goes with the idea they know what needs to be changed - early on in mmo's they are changed / balanced / nerfed... so heavily on the fly that its nearly impossible to road map 
---
Now that doesn't mean they shouldn't post a road map of future content and where they hope the game will go but it would be hard to do a comprehensive - once again that said they could do a mile stone style road map where they go phase 1 balance do bugs vault tech update / phase 2 ect ect 
---
You, uh, realize that 10% damage when aiming is a second slot right? Means it takes the same spot as explosive and can never drop on a TSE.
---
Considering the difficulty of the grind to get decent legendary Gear, I think the ability to Salvage and re-assign legendary modifiers (Major &amp; Minor Only), would help immensely, Prefixes should remain fixed so there still needs to be a reasonable amount of Grinding to get the Gear you want.
---
I believe a change like this would go a long way toward both balancing the game economy (Duper recovery), and giving hope to players that have had bad luck with the RNG rolls, and would definitely make those 3\* Tire Irons, Walking Canes, &amp; Rolling Pins less frustrating.
---
I know I would be very happy if I could take the weight reduction mod off that level 5 wooden armor leg, and put it on my 2\* level 50 BOS Combat leg.
---
 This may be considered a QOL issue for some, but considering the current state of the game economics caused by Duplication Exploits, and the selling of items for real life currency, something significant needs to be done to help rebalance things.
---
Placing most of the game plans in vendor inventory for purchase by anyone, was a step in the right direction (that I did not personally like, since I have been grinding to learn them for so long), but also hurt those trying to provide honest player vendor services.
---
If the Duplication exploits have actually been stopped (I have reason to believe they have not), then it's time to start making changes that help recover economic balance.
---
If Bethesda feels changes like this are not possible, then I would happily give up my 6 characters, 200+ combined levels, and everything else for a complete re-launch (Server Wipe).
---
There is clearly a bigger issue on server stability as they specifically call it out in their issue tracker log.
---
&gt;[All Platforms] Crashing, Server Stability, Performance
---
STATUS: We’re aware that there are many players experiencing various issues with crashing, server stability, and performance.

---
Releases on this should be coming out far more often than they currently are
---
And the updates on PC is not been better, it's only a couple of days of difference and I have yet to see them fix a bug that was identified on PC before it gets released on PS4/Xbox, so they clearly aren't doing it as a way to fix bugs before console release.  
---
Shut the hell up
---
This is amazing 
---
Long story (that we don't know fully) but they had an interval version control issue
---
Weird *VaultBoyFrosty* is a fanboy, who would have guessed?
---
I can tell you how someone gives up on a franchise as well as a publisher
---
This games release was an absolute poorly thought out mess in almost every area, it's been 3 months and it's still a complete mess. This sub is almost exclusively people complaining about the exploits and hackers while keep giving suggestions that are *completely* ignored
---
The only concession they made was deciding it would be a bad idea to give people plastic bags after they advertised canvas
---
My guess is that it's a sphere. The code probably just computes the distance between the origin point (the CAMP module) and whatever you're trying to put down and tells you whether you're in or out. It should be trivial to check, though. Build a camp with the origin module on the ground, see how far out the circle is. Then move it up a level and see if the circle gets smaller. If it's a sphere it will, if it's a cylinder it won't.
---
This is what i think all those guys did.
---
It is same hoax as trade stealing probably.
---
Fallout 76 isn't an asset flip, that's one of the least accurate complaints about a game with many flaws. There's more similarity between New Vegas and 3 than there is between 4 and 76, if you understand how the engine was rebuilt to include multiplayer. It was a significant technical achievement. There are so many other things about it that are legit bad
---
I'm looking for X-01 mod plans but haven't seen then anywhere, even in the enclave bunker vendors. Seen them for all other power armour types but looking to craft calibrated shocks for my X-01. On the incomplete lists I've not seen these listed

Well, this is one of what will likely be 10 separate pages worth, and this one has the fewest I think.

Thanks for sharing, good to know.

There is no such thing. All computerized RNG systems are biased. They have to use a table or seed which introduces bias.

Can’t tell you how many times dropped 100s of rounds I had stored just to lose weight
---
Thanks...  
---
I'm big on transparency...  
---
They said we would get a known issues list, didn't happen in the way I thought it would so making it
---
Agreed. I did Whitesprings for 3 hours last night. Got around 40 Legendary items. No problem from a volume standpoint. Only got one 3 star and two 2 star items. Of all the items only one of them was something I even wanted to look at keeping. It was a Executioners Handmade. Not farming for TSE, just looking for items that are worth equipping. Got 4 legendary Broadsiders...yay!
---
you did say exactly that. there's no need for you to screencap, I'll do it myself.
---
oh, and by the way, I managed to get the original before you edited it. did you forget reddit adds a little \* to edited posts? yeah.

Radium is said to have a 0.45% learn chance. Its certainly low, I learned them adter scrapping a lot of radium rifles! 
---
Ive been looking for one also. If you have the time to put A list together you'd be my hero!
---
I've had this bug happen and I was over level 100 at the time.  I fast traveled out of Whitesprings wearing all my gear, and arrived at my camp in my skivvies.  Do I have a video of it?  No.  But it was hard to miss and the 8 subsequent hours of scrounging up new legendaries was pretty memorable too.
---
Na its legit, there is a post with all of the other posts compiled and the dev person stated they were aware of the issue and it was going to take some time to fix. 
---
So? Bethesda could release their next game with a similar model and those people will come back. 
---
Lmao it sounds terrifying. I really enjoy the random events and how the npc's act on their own.
---
i'll take all your wood armor!  im serious
---
Removed because why?
---
I really liked that movie. I've even re-watched it a few times. But hey, I enjoy playing Fallout 76 too so maybe my tastes are different than most of the world?

I helped a lvl 8 and lvl 12 last night.  I’m a lvl 102.  One dude was jonesin for certain types of junk - adhesives and screws and springs and I hooked them up.  Could have charged them but didn’t.  He returned the favor by selling me some shotgun shells that I can always use.  I dropped some other stuff and then gave some friendly advice about what they should check out to level up without much trouble.  A good experience.  I’ve dropped plenty of loot and weapons for players because quite frankly I can’t use it all and maxed out on Super Duper you can craft a shitload of stuff very quickly.  Karma retuned the favor this morning as a guy dropped me a legendary 50 cal and I used that to team up with a group to take down the SBQ.  So the game can be fun and rewarding but I try to help out newbies as much as I can.  Every once in a while I encounter a griefer but that’s not often. 
---
Error is apart of being human, not specifically apart of 420 culture hence your misjudgment :)

we really just need a rain collector that makes boiled water and works anywhere like on a roof that collects dirty rainwater then uses energy to boil it - boom problem solved

Fallout 4 not only was an amazing game, it made modding way easier and accessible for both users and content creators, and is one of the things I love the most from the new content FO4 has brought. There're so many amazing mods and ideas that you can play the game for more than twice the content it offered from the begging.
---
They are embarrased
---
Oh. 
---
So just by shooting anyones camp, you can initiate full PvP with them. Or at least with their teammates.
---
Well, I'm going to wait until someone confirms it and believe it takes more to iniate full PvP.
---
x0-1 mod plans drop from queen. get farming.
---
Cat lady's house.  It's a farm (there's a big grain silo in front of it) to the northwest of Bolton Greens near Morgantown.  Lots of cat bowls.  Each one worth 2 Plastic.  You'll have about 70.
---
*Woah!* It's your **4th Cakeday** franklinmcmahon! ^(hug)
---
Weekly challenges doable in hour are sometimes 200 by itself. I will count how much atoms i had from release but i think it is over 10k.
---
And with enough trials the highly improbable outcome has a higher probability of occurring.  It’s why every lottery has a winner, eventually.
---
Oh absolutely not. I think it's one of the most broken loot systems around and I'm holding out hoping the game does improve. I made a reddit account just to talk about the game, how it could improve, how it's already amazing, and just general tips. I love the game and the fallout franchise as a whole. The only reason I'm so bothered by this is that this isn't the first time I've had this same argument with someone and this guy had the wrong attitude from the beginning. The entire conversation started when I told someone that recently bought a weapon (most likely really was a duplicated shotgun) that they are not all duped and that you do have a good chance of coming across one. One of my first uploads was talking about how to better your chances of getting legendaries to actually drop 3 * loot. (letting their health fall below half and then letting them heal) 
---
Which five games are you talking about? Because Bethesda has made three Fallout games. 
---
And are you suggesting Fallout 76, with its rejection of established lore and complete lack of interactive story, is true to the heart of the Fallout franchise? 
---
I just don’t understand. I have a combined total of 460 lbs on my person and in my stash... what are you people holding?!? 
---
it works on xbox I usually collect a 100 at a time 
---
Yes! Glad to see the gears are still turning on this one. I owe you a response to our exchange in our previous thread but it sounds like most of my thoughts have already been addressed here. I was going to speculate about these being random or deliberate based on these assets appearing in test or holding cells from the same two developers but I really don't know enough about BGS's design process to determine if this is meaningful. My gut is leaning towards random albiet thematic asset placement since these all appear in places associated with power, wealth, corruption, heinous deeds, etc. 
---
Either way, the seeds have been planted for some killer future content (wink wink, BGS). I love the moments where Fallout adds a touch of horror and would love to see more done with cultists and/or some cosmic horror. 
---
On a totally unrelated note, have you or u/Xix_Feng looked into the Guidestones or "Horse Creek Petroglyphs"? There's an entry on Curtis Wilson's terminal in the investigator's cabin with no subtext and a few entries on Michael Blake's terminal in VTU discussing whether the petroglyphs are indigenous or extraterrestrial but I can't find anything else about them. I'm curious if anyone knows what these refer to. 
---
Cat lady's house and Morgantown High School.
---
Honestly, though, if you need shotgun shells, just hunt mole miners in the Ash Heap for a bit. 
---
People always think probability dictates possibility. They take 1/100 literally and conjecture that if the probability is 1% then there MUST ONLY be 1/100 ever single time, no more no less. But in true randomness it is possible to hit even a 0.0001% 5 times in a row. Statistically almost null, but still 100% possible because true randomness does not care about mathematical status quo.
---
And another important thing people ignore, this isn't a gacha game where some things have better rates than others. The chance to get a "godroll" 3 star handmade.snd the chance to get an absolute piece of trash 3 star leather armour are exactly the same. If the RNG is on your side then that's that.
---
see I bought 20$ of atoms and use it as a stockpile anything over the 20$ worth I buy random items when I see a item I want on limited time sale I snag it then refill to the 20$ mark again
---
I mean hell I'm the person they are aiming for I have disposable cash and love costumes and even I'm not buying more atoms and I've spent..... lets say.... alot.... on costumes in games  
---
Moving the camp object won't change borders, they are ruled when it's first dropped.
---
But yeah it's easy to check as the ceiling should be fairly much lower on the edge, than on center.
---
Even Morgantown High School is good if you are lower level. Just go through the whole school, don’t miss the gym. 
---
Las Vegas floors are full of slot machines that use unbiased RNG.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by this. If Bethesda adds everything to the list of possibilities than the selection should be completely random.....unless Bethesda selectively chose to make certain weapons/armor more likely.
---
I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to convey there. it certainly doesn't prove that I said "you want me to say it to your face" *or* that you didn't. it only cements everything that I posted earlier. but ok.
---
meanwhile, I just proved that yes, you did say it, verbatim, and then edited the original post.

Maybe for koreans MMO players.

Once in a blue moon? Have you seen threads in both Bethesda forums and here? It was so prevalent before they fixed it that people literally couldn't play the game without relogging every 15-30 minutes. Now, it's not that bad, but it's even worse now from the standpoint is that it's so random, you don't even know when it will hit you. 
---
Before they fixed it, at least you knew that if you do too much damage with a shot, then it won't register. Now, it's a clusterfuck, whether or not they recharge their health. 
---
Rare bug LMFAO
---
I want video because thats only way to find out if you didnt do some mistake like drop that accidentaly. No offence.
---
I really wonder, how many people spent actual money to atom shop?
---
na you used 37 bullets and got 2 meat you starved to death cause you ran out of bullets 
---
also your irradiated corpse hatched a cluster of mothmen who mauled the rest of the party 
---
My issue with people an pvp is theyblacknbasic fundemantal understanding of game mechanics and how to flag or prevent flagging.
---
Once they do die to a pvp encounter the assumption is made they were griefed and or exploited in some fashion.
---
They're kind of right in that regard.  Players will absolutely exploit your lack of game knowledge in their favor.  
---
I don't get loot from the Queen I've invested 400+ bullets in, 80% the time, so much fun!
---
&gt; they'd usually see me and just kinda fly away 
---
No no no they are not flying  away (unless you are in low level areas and they are not hostile), they are programmed to follow you until they catch up to you.
---
I added the question mark to emphasize that i was repeating what you said. I've already screen capped and posted what you said 8hours ago. I followed that by r/iamverybadass which is a sub about people threatening or generally acting like assholes. I was quoting you. Look at the time stamps. This everyone. Is what I've been dealing with. 
---
Even if they can't make it for all armor types, cause texturing is \*hard\* work you know...  at least make it for the armor types people would want to buy it for.  I suppose, at least its not for Wood armor!  But make it for Combat armor, and they'd likely have at least 5-10x the sales.
---
The Atom store is such a weird thing - so many misses and only a few items worth buying.  Almost like they're allowing us to buy what we want from it without having to pay actual cash, rather just collecting atoms doing challenges.  I've blown atoms on silly things I wanted and still have some left for a really good limited time item to show up.
---
You do know when you pay for something, you are usually owed that thing. This game isn't free, and if they went customers, they have to make it better.
---
Why don’t you just stop eating raw foods and drinking non clean water? Its crazy easy to collect water and boil it, and foods not that tough to come across and cook.
---
I did not know that. Thanks for the tip.
---
I added a question mark to point out that it was you who said it first.. The bottom Pic is when you said it first. There is a time stamp at the top of every comment. 8hrs ago. The one you linked was from my response to your threat this morning. you really do need to be posted to r/iamverybadass because you seem like you want to fight me or something.

Latest bug: people randomly losing items (not really a new bug but becoming more prevalent now) https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apgrv5/items_are_disappearing_from/
---
Not true, they don't chase you forever, I've ran away from a lot of attacks and the beasts always give up and fly back 
---
"we are aware of this reports" this is still not proof for me, sorry.
---
I know many ways i could accidentaly lost item, like scraping in lags that happened to me, but thats not disapearing, just my mistake.
---
I drop legendary gear that I can’t use  at v76 or overseers camp
---
It depends, at the Charleston landfill the food is considered as the water pump that rapidly replenishes 5 purified water. At the sunshine meadows factory however the food comes from the processor on the ground floor of the factory, once powered up if you connect the terminal to the same power grid you can change which food it pumps out. Then there are a couple of farms and the food at those locations obviously comes from the crops that are already growing there.
---
That sucks.  I got sniped at WS a couple of weeks ago by a group of lvl 40-50 dbags.  I was there minding my own business farming ghouls and this one idiot comes up and gives me the thumbs up and starts blasting.  I get one shot off from my trusty TSE and all of a sudden 3-4 others show up and light me up.  I put up a good fight but still got worked.  I hunted the one guy down and blasted him but yeah it’s frustrating especially if you are just trying to lvl up and get XPs.  Getting your camp destroyed is the worst. 
---
Based on my experience, Radtoads are always in one of the lakes near Pleasant Valley Station.  If you go to Pleasant Valley Station and head north along the freeway that runs next to it, and keep an eye on the east side of that freeway, you'll eventually come across a lake with some water purifiers in it and at least a couple Radtoads.
---
Snallygasters always spawn in Charleston, specifically, to the southeast of Hornwright Industrial Headquarters near a broken bridge.
---
Hey I do alll of the daily and weekly things too. I encourage everyone to do it. I'm just saying that it's not as lucrative as you say. You have to put in a massive effort if you never want to spend real money. I've had to spend some real money already. Though now I'm sitting on 5000+ atoms that I've earned naturally. 
---
I don't understand why they think people want to run around the wasteland looking like they've committed an atrocity to fashion. People want to look sleek and badass, not look like they've just been involved in a paint fight
---
The receiver is nothing more than a slingshot though, it’s the war head that needs to change. Never quite understood how the mirv receiver worked but in new Vegas you could replicate mirv by using tiny Tim rounds 
---
&gt;I added the question mark to emphasize that i was repeating what you said.
---
funny how you couldn't be bothered to do so up until a few minutes ago. furthermore, if \*I\* was the one who originally said "you want me to say it to your face" (which, by the way, I don't find toxic at all), then prove it. link to a comment prior to https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aq2igl/how_to_deal_with_a_duper/egdj6r7/ in which I explicitly say those words.
---
Yea the ts non-explosive gauss I use is around 340 damage and I'm a rifleman vats crit build. It also has +50 % damage to crits, and 90% weight reduction. It has the piercing mags + I use tank killer. So in my situation the ts is better then my aa guass, witch btw has lower base damage. 
---
I also use a 3* radium rifle, I'll be honest I love it. It needs more mods, but just recently got the piercing mags and automatic prime reciever. The full auto is tempting. 
---
Livin' ain't easy in the wasteland kid.
---
Thats my point, you dont need money on it, so fuckers comparing atoms to dollar grind my gears.
---
Barbies post apocalyptic adventure!

I'll spend some time working on it today. I'm thinking a google sheet with a page for each vendor might be the way to go.

Yeah, I had a level 68 sentry bot start firing on the scorchbeast I was trying to fight yesterday.  Was a welcome interruption so I could crouch and disapear.  I was hardly putting a dent in the guys health bar and he'd heal back up.  Thank God for other NPCs.
---
I've been hitting these 3 vendors for the past couple of days with no luck on Plan: Metal Signs
---
My one wish from Bethesda is a new engine to develop their new robust, single player experiences
---
I want to figure out which vendors now sell the fusion generator and how much it costs. Sick of my smokey, noisy camp, and I really don't feel like wasting ammo/time taking over a power plant (might be okay in a team, but solo, it looks like fairly dull busywork).
---
They are cool looking a little creepy when they sit there looking at you with their red eyes.
---
Interesting that me and my friend above level 100 also had the same thing after treasure uniting near the ash heap. Both MM and FWM disappeared for us.....clearly to the XBOx server
---
So the handmade would apply to this perk as well?
---
Only grief in game is reclaiming workshop for killing infinite times and destroing camps.
---
Other is pure pvp and bethesda relativly done pvp flagging mechanics good.

There is no one left to collect our feedback, thats the issue.

Free games and fucking Anthem have a roadmap *prior to release*. Here we are  4 months out waiting...
---
It's a million to one chance.
---
And you know what they say about million to one chances.
---
&gt; “Scientists have calculated that the chances of something so patently absurd actually existing are millions to one.
---
But magicians have calculated that million-to-one chances crop up nine times out of ten.” 
---
-- pterry
---
Yes because individuals are having problems.  It isn't a blanket problem everyone deals with.   It is very selective and I think is the result of corrupted data on the players end.
---
Player running around with 3,000 pounds of items and junk doesn't help.
---
They do fix a few bugs fron pc releases to console
---
sadly :''(
---
First off, your DR stat is misleading. I can have more DR outside of my excavator PA than I do inside, yet I take substantially less damage inside of PA's because they have hidden DR and rad res multipliers. So if you're fighting any of the big baddies outside of PA, expect to take excessive damage. 
---
More importantly I've been 3-4 shotting them and that's how she's easy.
---
I run a bloodied build like the majority of everyone else, I keep myself at ~50% rad damage and I use adrenal reaction on top of that. Then I stack healing factor on top of that to make myself nearly invincible. Sometimes due to servers being laggy and unresponsive healing factor doesn't work properly so I have to use stimpacks then, but healing factor is sort of like having a constant stimpack.
---
Hello Games was an INDIE dev that had their office flooded, they lost COUNTLESS months of work and progress and had to revert to a prepre alpha build. I honestly forgive them as they used the money from sales to really fix the game.
---
Bethesda on the other hand has shown us 
---
A: A multi billion dollar studio can’t test a title in house
---
B: MtX is most important
---
C: They left the game with a team of one whole developer who can barely make the same fixes modders made day one. 
---
“We understand your frustration and will pass these notes along to the dev team. While you’re at it please check out the atomic shop!”
---
&gt; **BoSZ01 "Forbidden Knowledge" \[QUST:0010D89F\]** 
---
Not sure how trading in multiple Technical data is considered an exploit, unless it was actually causing instability.    
---
&gt; For daily quests..... 
---
We understand that, the problem is some of the people I know are manic about doing the daily's and check the pipboy frequently. Additionally some of them repeatedly Enter the "Pumpkin" and "Trunkstop" cells which usually will trigger the daily, and will server hop to try and re-trigger it.  
---
The common denominator for all of them is they hid all their quests at one time or another while grouped (as we often do, cleaning up the UI).
---
Not to mention some damn planters to make a rooftop garden
---
I don't want to give any credit to the developer gobbling tycoon but sometimes even evil does good.
---
Is it also normal for another persons C.A.M.P. system to have the notification "Workshop cannot be contested" show up when trying to interact with it?
---
100% this. If I have a bulk of 20 or more, I sell what I don't need. Now my stash is full of mats, clothes, magazines, and assorted junk Legendaries and I continuously hover around 550-580. Mind you, with some rare exceptions, I've collected every piece of clothing in the game. So that's a lot of clothes.
---
All I ever get from the queen is just garbage. 
---
I just want a dang salute emote.
---
It is interesting to see what is around when I go to my Camp, lately it has been those little asshole Chinese Bots - I forget their name
---
I dont get why we use dirty/boiled water for cooking when i have water purifiers and a abundunce of the stuff.makes no sence
---
Seriously, and apparently they have been working on it for weeks. Why would it take this long unless they were scrambling to figure out what the plan actually is?
---
But In all seriousness, it’d be nice to hear from the actual dev team instead of the community managers
---
OR better yet, let us disassemble ammo into components and make the ammo we need. Like we did in FO:NV or was that FO3? Been too long since I played either.
---
The law of large numbers tells us that in enough trials everything will regress to its mean average. So while more trials will increase your likely hood of obtaining a god roll we would still only expect to find 1 TSE for every 2 million 2* legendaries that you kill. So while you may find 2 or 3 after killing 2 million......by the time you kill 6 million we would expect that number to regress back to the expected average of one for every 2 million.
---
I don't accept random invites but my CAMP budget is pretty much maxed out anyways.  Not a single toilet so maybe it could use some restroom additions!  Just go do it in the stream for now.
---
Hiiiiii, discord link pls and thanks.

---
\*nod\* that is what the console players report as the only work around.  
---
&gt; V.A.T.S. 
---
Huge problem, but it seems erratic, I had a weapon, can't remember which, that didn't seem to suffer from it, and I completely forgot about that until someone mentioned they see it more commonly with X vs Y.  
---
Hopefully if we can prove one weapon seems to suffer more than another, we can run down the common denominator(Or prove it's observational bias).  
---
&gt;  Vendor Trade Interaction 
---
Just trying to sell a single item works better, means you're not out more caps :)
---
You should try and see ?

This just isn't true. You should make some videos and do a post to show your proof :) 
---
I *think* I bought mine in Watoga, but I could be wrong. I'll know by the end of the day though. I'm off today, so I'll work on the list while I wait on the washer and dryer.

&gt;  All computerized RNG systems are biased. 
---
Not true.  All computerised (pseudo) RNG systems a (with enough information) *predictable*, but any decent one is not *biased*.
---
But muh caaaps

That's great, but compared to melee and rifles they simply suck.

He is by far more interesting, thats for sure! Also he might be alive, unlike fallout 76 NPCs.

http://imgur.com/a/sqUM7io right here. I posted it three different times and sent it as a message. It's the bottom photo. I just wanted people to see that it was all one general post and not some hodge podge thrown together out of context because one of your comments takes up my entire phone screen.

I understand your doubt, but how would I accidentally drop 5 different pieces of armor while fast traveling?  I don't wear PA and was visibly wearing all of my armor when I went on the world map and selected my camp.  Between my own experience and the dozens of other threads about this issue, I am pretty confident this is a server side glitch that happens when the game tries to rebuild you at your new travel location (there's even an audible grunting noise when your inventory arrives) only the server hiccups or whatever and fails to load your worn items.  Given this game's many other server problems that seems far more likely than a guy with 100+ hours of gameplay and all legendary armor pieces accidentally dropping all of his armor (which would have taken 5 separate drop actions plus scrolling through inventory to find them all) and not noticing he's completely naked when leaving the pip boy inventory and then fast traveling out.  I mean I have played a video game before.
---
Question, because I can't get on for several hours, could you check to see if you can craft Throwing Knives at different levels?  
---
Curious if it's possible the "Thrown" knife is being replaced with an equivalent lower level knife (There is a process in which the engine registers a hit and replaces the thrown projectile with a new object) 
---
that doesnt make sence becauce they wouldnt provide enough rads and pressure to create any real change
---
That time is still now. Free games like Apex Legends and games like Anthem have the roadmap on day 1 or prior to release. Something is very wrong with the future of this game. 
---
I heard one before, many levels ago, and went hunting for it but noting. Hope you get too take one out, decent little fight.
---
Human?

How dare you, meatsnack!

We're going to take a look at this event and investigate the pathing issues some of you have mentioned here. Thanks for your reports!

I would prefer a mind wipe so we forget we played and payed for this game.

I have a lvl15 handmade silenced it works well bought the handmade plans and I’m trying to lvl that
---
Oh no not the ban hammer!
---
Indeed, wanted to read
---
Given that this game already was supposed to be in development since a bit more than two years....how high are the chances it would be finished by then?
---
The only dlc that seemed planned was the vaults, and TBH they seem like a shitty dlc
---
It’s only broken if you’re a griefer 
---
no mini nukes dont provide enough energy to do that even with the upgrade the effects wont be the same

That works. You available this evening? 830 eastern standard ?

You can sell it to other players. 😁

Every time I accidentally drink from my water pump instead of collect, I get a disease. Without fail.
---
Had the game since January 2nd. Ran into exactly 1 infinite health mob. I logged out and back on fixed problem. 
---
Tell me why others apparently have it so frequently but I have never ran into it? Do I have a magical ps4? Is my ps4 the only wired one in existence?
---
Is 600kbps upload and 4mbps download the magic ratio for the game?
---
9310atoms. I didnt completed all challenges, could have more.
---
Its 50-100 daily + 100-200 weekly. + Random challenges u complete only one time.
---
Or, you know, be able to use purified water for cooking. I mean, cooking with purified water would turn it into boiled water, right?
---
It's always a bit if a gamble, but then it can get hot! Done of my best legendary runs have been showing up to whispering when no one else is around and clearing it results in 2-4 solid drops that fit my play stlye. It is rare, but it does happen.
---
if it does i would argue that it's incidental or to better serve a later, more evil purpose lol
---
I agree, my post was for maximum output of the weapon but not necessarily the best for a full build. I don't use lock and load because the gatling gun reloads pretty quick especially with the +25% reload from Speed Demon which I think is what you meant. I also don't use luck of the draw since I have enough backup weapons to switch to if it breaks. Tenderizer ranks up +5/+6/+7% so if you don't want to spend too much the first rank is the best value. Adrenaline I would say gives a decent bonus and warrents eventually maxing out when you can. One point in each heavy gunner also gives better damage bonus than rank 3 into a single one ( +10/+15/+20 per card). Hope this clarifies a bit more. :)

the one that says "but you did say "That is a made up statistic." in response to me saying that the chances of rolling a god 3\* are 0.000001%, so anyone would assume you rolled 6 god ones. the chances of rolling a 2\* are much better."?

excuse me but I must be going blind. please, highlight the exact portion where I say "you want me to say it to your face", verbatim. because I can't for the life of me find it.

truly now, that they have all the BPs handy.

Shame it couldn’t port your stuff over if you login with your old credentials

Sometimes the Vendors display 0 caps. Just back out of the trade UI and go back in. Apparently they refresh every 20 hours so they should have caps. Just keep trying until the caps show up
---
&gt; He claims to be over 1k hours in.
---
It was released on 14/11/2018.  That's about 2184 hours ago.
---
He claims he's been playing it for nearly 12 hours a day, continuously.
---
Don't bother. Bethesda doesn't bother either.
---
I just want a coffin, both as a prop and a usable bed.
---
C'mon Bethesda. My vampire character needs a place to rest. 
---
I don't know, I just want them to prove us both wrong. 
---
No levels on them. Moving them to a new container and back will restack them into a single stack as well.
---
Not sure why the vendor started out with 0, but vendors are linked by faction (I think there are 7 different vendors, but some are the same group). There are maps online that show the different vendor groups.
---
Oh, so those large flies that appear for a brief moment is normal? I've never seen that before.
---
I love that sign. I’m gonna get it as soon as I have more atoms. I don’t want to spend my real money on them. 
---
I believe you that you earned a lot of atoms. But I just want it to be clear that you cannot get 100 atoms from a set of dailies. It's 50-60 tops.
---
Todd Howard pretty much abused us with this game, #metoo for us in fallout 76!
---
With the way there working on it now, no way in hell. Probably just manage to push it out without bugs at that time
---
... you do understand people paid for this flaming turd, right?
---
removed? Really?
---
LOL, thanks for bringing them out of hiding.
---
But duped weapons still exist. They do not just vanish just cause beth fixed the glitch
---
the turret prob got destroyed and disappeared, i you go to build mode, you prob would have seen a yellow outline of it where you could repair, then scrap it
---
or its a glitch in the matrix, but not this game! fallout has no glitches:-)
---
fuuuuk yeah!!!
---
I believe it's just an animation like flies over poop. I'm sure you'll see it again if you look for it 
---
I have had 2 explosive drops (both bolt-action pipe pistols) in 160 levels
---
And what triggers that bug? 
---
"you are suffering from dysentery" is a gentle way of notifying the player that that have shit themselves.
---
This is great to know, I'll try it tonight on Xbox.  I often times run out of boiled water because it takes so long to collect or I will collect it and just drink it to shorten the process.
---
Vendors are divided into Factions (who they are allied with).  Each Faction shares a daily pool of Caps, resetting 20 hours after you use them.
---
The Responders.  The Raiders.  Whitespring.  The Enclave.  Watoga.  The Brotherhood of Steel.  The Free States.
---
Some of these, namely the Responders and Raiders, make up a majority of the vendors in the starting areas, and they all sell very similar things.
---
I totally understand! i am also part of the minority here as i still enjoy the game alot, i think us fans of Fallout series enjoy the games so much (and have been playing them for years and years now
---
)  that alot of us are particularly non-plussed how one of our favorite franchises is being treated.
---
that said, you are totally right that everyone here needs to step back and remember to be civil, even if we are upset.  good call!
---
Id imagine the plan is to introduce "seasons" with factions entering the wasteland. That way they can reuse all of the assets they havent yet from F4. Id actually be down with this, adding raiders, gunners, etc that would change the game world. 
---
Whatever the dlc is i bet its somehow recycled F4 content to minimize costs.
---
I want an "I'm sorry!" Emote. And a laughing one. I'd use use both very often. 
---
Not a plan but just throwing it out there that I found the mod for excavator calibrated shocks on Vendor Bot Chad yesterday. Cost about 300 caps.
---
Just the mod but if that’s all you need, give him a visit. 
---
Good to know! Thanks. 
---
What's the point of supporting? They sold me a live service game, I got a broken alpha product and I won't be buying their products in the future if they abandon it.
---
http://imgur.com/a/nFb5MOv my mistake I missed it. 
---
5x 20 is 100. Isn't it?
---
So i can. And i had.
---
I am in the Xbox one X and I constantly crash.
---
That's the messed up thing with this game. No one knows exsctly what triggers some bugs. I was also playing on the ps4 and my system crashed every 30 minutes for like a month then it magically stopped, then it came back. At that point I decided to uninstall and wait for Beth to fix this mess but I lost all faith in them since then.
---
More power to you man. Sorry if I came off as an ass, that wasn't my intention. I just don't like when people minimalize other people's issues just cause they haven't encountered them.
---
Anyways, if you enjoy the game and don't run into bugs, then more power to you and I'm happy for you. Enjoy it while it lasts! 
---
What dimension are you from? Hiring more of a position isn't the same thing as having none of that position on staff. We're not talking about positions that there might only be one of in a company like CIO or something. This argument is like saying that because McDonald's put out an ad to hire 3 fry cooks, that's proof they don't have *any* fry cooks on staff. Which is stupid.
---
Hey don't be dissing tuxs - just got the new year's tuxs and they're awesome.  Fits right into my Whitesprings themed CAMP!  Not all of us want to be raiders.
---
I can't tell you how jealous I get from the Anthem subreddit. EA has shit policies but they sure can hype a game.
---
If you’re on Xbox I have a spare plan for the fusion generator. I believe the watoga vendor has them and so does grahm for 196 caps (for me, I have level 3 hard bargain) 
---
Seriously. Between you and me, the world will never run out of Worms. 
---
No one knows. I don't think even the devs know. That's why that thread was created. Probably has to do something with the servers but it's all speculation atm. 
---
I'd like to see proof that there was ever a day with 5 challenges of 20 value each. I've played every day since beta and I do not recall that. 
---
Yaaay, one non-fanboy.  Thanks for the support.
---
Right now its like you ordered a fine meal and the waiter brought you a smoking turd while laughing at you.
---
If auto receiver: commando. If semi-auto: rifleman 
---
He called me a bitch, seems butt hurt to me
---
It's actually not possible because the "level up" daily is always worth 10 atoms. That does not change. 
---
lol nice
---
Ha, wait until the first time three of them agro and chase you across half the map!
---
tomorrow's headlines after this comment: "BETHESDA BANNING PLAYERS FOR COLLECTING WATER"
---
"it just works"
---
looking at the lack of knowledge of the CMs and the shady practices at Bethesda Austin I doubt the devs could be compelled to show their face in public
---
Lesson learned from me. I'll never be paying full price for a Bethesda game any more.
---
They are lazy developers, FO76 is on a engine thats a decade old, they clearly know how to please shareholders by releasing hyped up crap.
---
Problem is, players slowly pick up on this, and they are deleting their goodwill every release.
---
They lost me as a customer going forward, I won't be buying their games I'll probably just pirate them or look for deals around $10. I hope other players follow suit after their experience with FO76
---
You get it free for doing the powering up power plant events. Poseidon plant is usually just low level scorch. I just went in with melee weapons to conserve ammo. I know it seems dull but it saves caps for something else :)
---
I actually did have to replace my controller... after Monster Hunter World, it had some cracks and maybe teeth marks... ahem... but then yeah, easy next time round
---
Well, you're supposed to kill the vast majority of entities present in FO76, so not caring about them would probably help.
---
There is a bug where it shows 0 caps sometimes. As another posted, one thing that sometimes helps is to exit trade and go back in. Even easier, just try to sell something and it should let you. After that the vendors caps should show correctly. I see this occur often.
---
still not seeing it. here's the post in question:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aq2igl/how_to_deal_with_a_duper/egd5q0c/
---
I keep ctrl+fing "you want me to say it to your face" but I cannot find it.
---
Hi! I sent PMs to some of you asking for account details so the dev team can better replicate this internally during investigation.
---
Wish I saw more posts like this about the joy of playing fo76. I get it, there are bugs, but I know there are a lot of people out there having fun too.
---
Unfortunately there isn’t anything you can do. Multiple people have posted here about this issue, some even giving very detailed accounts of items they lost and when. Bethesda is unable or unwilling to do anything for individuals losing items. 
---
Idk im still pretty weary about it. 
---
I am in the same situation.  I just unchecked the quest tracker. I probably grabbed the tapes out of order or something stupid.
---
Sometimes it’s glitched and says 0 caps but try selling a piece of junk or something to them and it will refresh auto
---
Yep. That's math I can get behind. They have a word for it on 4chan. NEET. 
---
&gt; Yes because individuals are having problems. It isn't a blanket problem everyone deals with. It is very selective and I think is the result of corrupted data on the players end.
---
No there are times where I will be playing with friends and we will ALL get server disconnects at the same time.  Sometimes it will only impact one of us, but most times we all get booted at the same time, even if we are in different areas of the map.  This continued after the last patch.  
---
If the whole stash limit and carry weight limit is something that is impacting the servers that greatly that other players running around with more than 3000 lbs is causing MY game to disconnect when I'm carrying 175 then a database restructure should be their #1 priority (since that ties into server stability) and also would increase player satisfaction since it would allow players to hold more items. 
---
Their database structure is crap - period.  If tracking that many items on each players inventory was such a big issue since the inception of the game, then why include perks and legendary effects that reduce the weight of items, allowing players to carry more of the items bogging down the server and causing issues.  Its counter productive.  Either the weight limit was a design choice (in which case perks/legendary effects make sense) or it was a system limitation (in which case perks/legendary effects do not make sense).  
---
And I have yet to see them fix a single bug in the console version after it was reported on the PC - but then again, it's been 3 months now and we are only on Patch 5 of a game that has had issues since before the game was released.  
---
Let's not even get into some of the changes are just to add artificial barriers to slow progress down since they don't even have content to release to players.  
---
* they are not release patches fast enough given the state of the game
---
* they are not communicating properly given the state of the game (the last from the vault doesn't even indicate when the next patch would be)
---
* they are not providing in game support for issues to players
---
* They are not showing that they are truly listening to player feedback, and instead are focusing on trying to stretch out the game in order to give themselves more time
---
I refuse to give them a pass, I have played numerous online games - even games from indie developers have better communication and support than this game.  I see better support from P2W mobile games than what we are getting here.  
---
Open the map, LB into the main menu, open Settings, and in there adjust your look sensitivity under Game.  If you make it so that it takes a ton of stick movement to look either way, it's much easier to stay on the wire and beams.  When you're done, change it back to what you prefer for normal play.
---
I'm not saying this is a requirement to beat this part, but if you're having this much trouble with it then it helps.  Also - if you beat that one make sure you beat the other two and the live fire course all in one session - a disconnect or restart sometimes starts you from getting a uniform again.
---
Cut him some slack, it is just one guy
---
The areas that dont have robots have roaches, especially on the 3rd floor. 
---
Well, that is good.
---
It’s percentage based. You won’t always get a plan each time. So if you want certain plans for certain weapons build a bunch and then start scrapping hoping you get what you want. Someone earlier said the radium Rifle only had a .5% chance to learn a plan or something ridiculously low like that. 
---
They have a very low chance of unlocking anything after the first few mods, also as far as I heard every weapon no matter the mods has a chance of unlocking stuff
---
I don't think I ever said I played *over* one thousand hours. I believe I said about, around, roughly.
---
I have played *over* seven hundred hours, though. that I know for sure.
---
There was once level up in beer hat or sonething like that for daily. But i got your point i didnt count that in.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/e2z3aT4 this one maybe? I hate imgur.

Holy shit I nearly spit my coffee out at this
---
Sorry for the bad news bud, if you’re on Xbox I have some decent legendary melees I could hook you up with. But nothing instigating. 
---
Can't exactly diss the tux if I actually bought it myself with free atoms can I lol, all I said is I don't see anybody around who wears them whilst I'm around the wastes.
---
I don't wear raider gear, I just want more variants and other items fitting the lore and environment of fallout than gimmicky stuff, I actually wear a more militaristic approach of combat/leather and scout gear.
---
Btw I bought the tux because I thought at the time of starting a faction based on the kingsman special agents 
---
While on the subject of water; The fountain in whitespring cures your deceases.
---
I can already hear YongYea's voice in my head.
---
Sounds awesome. I'd agree, that would probably be the easiest way to do it. 
---
Thank you for this.  I just picked up a new Xbox and the game last night after being away from gaming for years.  Tonight will be my first time logging on, and posts like this are not only helpful, but refreshing to see amongst all the non-constructive complaining. 
---
I unlocked Vault-Tec paint for PA and it only seems to work on T-60 and X-01, was disappointed by this. Has anyone else experienced this problem? I thought it would do all PA.
---
Good catch - good my mutations mixed up.  Yes with Speed Demon for faster reloads.  I'd consider stacking Adrenaline as well if you have points to spare, less so on Tenderizer.  For weapon breaking, Weapon Artisan 3 is god tier for repairs...  200% condition is already 2x durability for 3 points, its an absolute must have plus if you have any melee at all you want those repaired to max for extra damage.
---
They peaked with the race car bed, never going to beat that.
---
I have seen some error message there, can't remember what. You of course can't interact someone elses camp device.
---
No it's ok I'm on xbox but I have some back up items like 2 all rise
---
Explain me, why isn't it a asset flip?
---
It is, no matter what you say:
---
* Textures / meshes directly taken from Fallout 4
---
   * Landscape
---
   * Buildings
---
   * Many weapons
---
   * Equipment
---
   * Scorchbeasts are taken from Skyrim (With sloppy copied code from Skyrim as proof)
---
   * Many Items
---
   * Enemies
---
They copied even bugs from Fallout 4, like the famous Power Armor Bug. I mean... that's more than obvious that they copied and don't even care.
---
&gt; the engine was rebuilt to include multiplayer. It was a significant technical achievement. 
---
Simply said, no. Creating a multiplayer game is not a significant technical achievement. You see how it works right now. It's a buggy mess with a lot of disconnects and things not loading, desync etc...
---
&gt; Because don't misunderstand me, judging by articles, forums and Reddit, there seems to be a lot more interest in this game from the player community than its development team. 
---
And what you really notice on the forums are that no one stays around more than about a month before they stop caring and move on, never to be seen again.
---
Did you seriously make a post to complain about people being toxic then dox a dude's username who got in an argument with you?
---
This is incredibly toxic and it seems like you just need validation that you won your petty internet argument.
---
My stealth rifleman is has a couple of rifleman perks but I want to do stealth automatic rifles and pistols as well
---
Im pretty happy with my bloodied sledge hammer that i stuck the searing rocket mod on, then i stuck the croquet mallet from the store on it and people dont understand why my croquet mallet hits so hard... and cripples limbs... and procs bleed...
---
Seriously, what kind of asshole would cook with dirty water when they have gallons and gallons purified water at hand?
---
Maybe changing the way it works introduces a terrible bug of some sort. I'm sure they don't want to risk having any bugs in the game.
---
Haha yeah me too! There are for sure some things that need to be worked on. Honestly, the things mentioned by everyone, I haven't even experienced yet. There are great things about this game, and I just wanna share the cool stuff I come across :D 
---
Settle down, I'm just shit posting.
---
While that sounds agonizing, it sounds kind of thrilling at the same time haha
---
I can’t even begin to tell you how this became the Wildlands Reddit’s mantra. Worst handled game ever.
---
Thanks, I'll pass this along to the development team.
---
Stabilized is learned from scrapping. It took me hundreds of parts to get it for Combat Armor and Marine Armor. See: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af0tfe/learn_marine_armor_stabilized_arms_and_dense/
---
The unlock you got "Brotherhood of Steel" was for the Combat Armor Helmet. That's the only BoS Material Mod that unlocks with scrapping. The Arms/Legs/Torso are unlocked by plan.
---
Up that disease resist!  It helps a lot if you are well fed and well quenched before doing this to minimize disease chance... but yeah that's a side effect. 
---
Ah, so only 8 hours a day, 7 days a week.  That makes a big difference.
---
That's what I'm actually thinking by now too.
---
Looking at the sparse patches and fuckups between I can only assume Bethesda Austin is just a call-center or the like and the only IT guy there is told to develop 76 while being pestered by other staff because their computer isn't turning on again!
---
I found a Two shot pistol which is pretty sweet, i think its explosive i cant remember cause its on the alt i stopped playing cause pistols mostly suck. 
---
Alright. Just wanted to see if maybe something else may have been messed up with the CAMP systems like it working like a workshop which could explain for the PvP initiated. Though it is unlikely. What other ways would PvP be initiated while me being in Pacifist mode and my party member not initiating PvP with the CAMP assailant?
---
True. There is investment. Same as with Thru Hiker and Pharmacist. 
---
&lt;3
---
Nice, I always go in through the rear.
---
Yep. Radex with a hazmat suit and you can get several hundred pretty fast.
---
Thanks for the tip, my house is just up the cliff from the monorail elevator, very mountainous and no standing water for miles.  Thus the reason for my post.  We can't all have riverfront cabins in the forest you know
---
Really? I was never a fan of the GR series so I didn’t keep up on it but I thought it had a good launch/post launch
---
This has been posted before. See the comments here:

---
Scrapping a weapon gives a chance to learn a mod - you will never have a plan in your inventory as a result of scrapping.  It'll just pop up in the corner of the screen that you unlocked a mod, and when working on that particular type of weapon in the future the mod will be available.
---
Most mods require perks to be able to add them to a weapon, so learning a mod will not necessarily mean you can build it on a weapon right away.
---
It returns you from the dead? Can’t you just respawn?
---
Thanks! Have lots of fun!
---
I had one attack me near whitesprings and the fucker took over the sentrybot next to me and killed me with it I was pissed and left (was like level 45 at time so no way to kill level 60 sentrybot)
---
250 caps on the Grafton Responder bot.
---
Well, that and I never party up...
---
...however, I am a massive admirer of your plan for Appalachia: toilet capital of the post-apocalypse.
---
You know, when a game is difficult, you usually get better at it until it doesn’t feel as difficult.
---
guess being a bitch is the new meta.
---
Unfortunately the only thing you can do is grieve for its loss and move on.
---
I've had a few items disappear myself so I know how it feels, luckily they havnt been anything I would've been too peeved to lose like my tse lever action rifle but there's nothing that can really be done to get anything back that goes 
---
It was Fallout New Vegas, and yea that would be the best option. I have so much crap ammo I want to turn into 5.56, .45, and .308
---
If I accidental lie down on a sleeping bag while looting junk, - disease. 
---
If I walk through a puddle water -disease
---
Hit by gouls - disease
---
Fall into scorchbeast turd pile-disease
---
yes, that's the one. I'll even link it: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aq2igl/how_to_deal_with_a_duper/egd75g5/
---
however the context is completely different than what you make it out to be in your original post in this topic.
---
I said that after implying you weren't very good at math because you couldn't grasp basic probability concepts. I tried my best not to be rude. that was, up until you started making false allegations, such as *"We were discussing Tse and you decided to call me a liar."*, name-calling such as *"Then you have shitty rng."* and even personal attacks such as *"Do something other than play the game."*.
---
so it seems you're just as toxic as me.
---
Not everyone has gallons of purified water on hand. It would be great if they let you cook recipes with either boiled or purified. 
---
I just didn't care to remove it since he is in the comments doing the same thing he was before. I wasn't going to link or anything. From the way it seems I didn't win anything. He's still here arguing. 
---
Those are randomized. The plans are static after the January patch. 
---
hmmm... I collect a lot of water from ponds/streams and my toon drinks it dirty. It claims to have a %2 disease chance and this feels about right.
---
You simply created a super vacuum and sucked up the bases in your vicinity! We see through your shaddy tactics! 
---
Sorry brah, I had all the colors and then scrapped them to make space in my STASH.
---
I've had him get stuck on nothing. Just stops. Finally figured out its because one of the scripted enemy spawns along the route isn't happening. Sat and waited 5 minutes one time trying to get him to move when the mole rats finally spawned and then he continued on. 
---
Liberators.  Most annoying thing after mole rats.
---
I missed that, dumb old me thinking I figured something out myself.  I will note the original post there is unhelpful, but folks in the comments mentioned this trick.  Seems like it may still be a bit under the radar though, hopefully I helped out someone who didnt know by now anyway!
---
Ah, the launch was fine. As time went on rather than adding content they kept adding expensive, and lazily made store items (reskinned guns with purposely duplicated audio, inaccurate gear etc) and ignoring bugs. I think since release content wise they’ve added like 5 short and extremely basic missions (the game suffered badly over time with lots of cut and paste mechanics) and guns in the store for nearly £10 EACH.
---
Contact bethesda so they can tell you too bad. Worked wonders for me.
---
I only recently discovered that scorchbeast turds are a real thing
---
&gt;I'll probably just pirate them
---
That's the spirit.
---
**Graphics-Godrays(?)**: the effect sometimes floods my screen and I can barely see anything, usually just before sunset. For example, standing outside the Watoga high school looking at the train station. PC all high settings. Will try to get a screenshot next time.
---
**Performance-Hiccups due to audio loading(?)**: PC all high settings, Full HD windowed, Windows 7, i7 4770K, GTX 1060, SSD 500MB/s, 500MBit/s Net, 16 GB RAM maxed out during gameplay. The game freezes for 200-500 milliseconds and then plays a sound effect not played before in that session. For example, I kill an enemy, sound effect 1 plays immediately; I kill the next enemy, hiccup, and plays sound effect 2. Sometimes the game still updates during this time as enemies can warp around. I don't know the reason for this: too many memory-mapped files causing page faults, network wait on the UI thread, loading resources from the UI thread? Closing all apps but the game reduces the occurrence a bit.
---
**Graphics-Dust effect bugged**: [sometimes it is just purple rectangles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj5e9f/purple_dust_when_digging_treasure_mounds/).
---
**Graphics-Stuttering when strafing and aiming**: [not sure what it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agxs9y/odd_mouse_stutter_in_interior_cells_when/), I suspect it to be a temporal aliasing problem as a frame-by-frame look indicates a glitched frame between normal frames. On PC all high settings, Windows 10, i7 8700, GTX 1060, SSD 3500MB/s, 32GB RAM, Full HD fullscreen. Very rarely happens on the i7 4770K mentioned above.
---
**Graphics-Bad lighting effect**: [On very low settings](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a583qu/odd_lighting_anomaly_after_patch/) (almost everything turned off in the ini), since December 11. Have not pursued it as the machine is below minimum spec for the game. Plays well enough though.
---
**Graphics-Bad, purple texture with text on a rock:** posted many times by many, such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a20lb0/found_some_weird_purple_code_on_a_rock/).
---
**Graphics-Assets fail to load(?)**: [I could enter into the Watoga vendor's room](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aligl2/watoga_station_vendor_has_no_door/) as there was no door. Fast travel away and back fixed it. I have no idea how loading resources could fail with verified integrity game files. Is there a timeout in the engine to load resources?
---
**Graphics-Enemy head drops and stays on the body too(?)**: Happens with Scorched a lot (also using bloody mess 3 if that matters); I shoot them in the head, they drop a full head but the body stays intact with a head as well.
---
**Graphics-Other players are completely invisible, can invite the "air" to trade though**: happens rarely and in events; there are no cloak-shimmering, they are on the map but do not show up on the compass. I can't tell if they are just really crouching and/or using tech/armor to stay invisible.
---
**UI-The "waiting for loot" spinning arrows stay on**: loot can be delayed so the game indicates it with the spinning arrows. However, if the container turns out to be empty, the arrows may keep spinning until I look away.
---
**QoL-Pipboy/PA light turns off on transition:** I think this happens when entering an interior, but not sure about the reverse right now. It would be great to have a setting that allows me to keep it on.
---
**QoL-Logging out in 1st person, yet logged in as 3rd**: not sure why this happens sometimes, I play 1st person.
---
**QoL-Mark armor as equipped when in PA consistently**: some screens indicate the armor/clothing is (logically) equipped, i.e., shows the square in front of the name, while in PA, others don't. Have to be extra careful when trading/scrapping items.
---
**QoL-Toggle-hide equipped weapons/armor/PA frames on trade/scrap screens**: it is unlikely I want to sell my currently equipped weapon/armor or a PA frame in general. It would be even better this defaulted to hidden.
---
**QoL-Favorite perk cards**: Currently, they list in alphabetic order but I don't use most of them per SPECIAL. It would be great that some cards could be always in the front so I don't have to scroll between bloody mess and super duper all the time.
---
**QoL-Adaptive loadout**: I know this is a stretch and could be considered unfair advantage. There is a loadout manager for PC, which I don't use, that let's one swap perk cards via the perk screen. Instead, it would be fantastic if when switching to a weapon, the respective perk cards would be auto equipped. Same goes for entering for lockpicking and hacking; one is not using a weapon so, for example, Riflemans and Gunsmith could be temporarily replaced by Picklock and Hacking cards.
---
Damn. I need your asylum hopping luck then. LoL
---
Fair enough. At least I didn't threaten you. Having shitty luck is nothing to be offended by. I have shit luck irl. I have to clock in in about 30mins so is there any chance we can get a conclusion on this and say we are both wrong and that this argument was pointless and a bit irritating for us both? 
---
I feel you, I would not mind if they were obtainable using atoms as long as they are reasonably priced, they'd just have to put a limit to how many you can buy.
---
it really does. do you have any idea how it feels to be severely sleep deprived?
---
this is not the first game I clock several hours in. I must have well over 3k on Dark Souls.

---
Is this still bannable? Being a shady super vacuum? Please Todd tell me it ain't true!
---
Agreed. There's so much noise in the sub, and so many things are posted over and over again. But since the noise, posting stuff again often raises visibility. Thanks for sharing.
---
Wait is there actually just one guy working on it or is this a meme?
---
So basically the same as Fo76? (Minus the ok launch)
---
the mono rail pillars have stairs on them and are build able, if you deploy your camp and walk up the stairs you can see the bottom/sides of the build area shrink before you make the final selection. .. ie its a circle like you say.
---
Sure, add me - ParryLBP
---
I have a mic but rarely put it on, I talk all day at work with clients, so evening time is for silence a lot ;)
---
It was nice knowing you...but Todd might be on his way to you as we speak you better be running now!
---
&gt;Bethesda fucked me and for that I will never purchase another one of their games no matter how good it is.
---
That is exactly the road I'm taking. Elder Scrolls 6? Starfield? IDGAF, not buying them. *Especially* knowing they're built on the same shit engine.
---
&gt;500 caps. Not 63.
---
Yeah WTF do those vendor bots need to keep a profit of 437 caps for? Robo Hookers? 
---
I stopped playing about two weeks ago.  Grabbed a few indie titles during the Chinese New Year sale, mainly puzzle games, and don't know what it will take to get me to pick up 76 again.
---
Pretty bummed about it, really wanted to be playing it for as long, if not longer than I did FO4.  I'm not even close.
---
By the ballroom above the shop section of the Whitespring they're hidden in a kind of off to the side room
---
I just find a water source that isn't toxic because of this very reason. It's silly that I can carry 240 lbs of stuff, but only pump once every 5 seconds.
---
&gt;a sea of slop and poor execution
---
That really sums up FO76 in one tidy sentence.
---
Crouch walk on the beam and wire sections.  You move slower, and can correct more easily. You get plenty of time to slow down on those 2 obstacles.
---
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, though I don't disagree with the theory itself, and have no reason to doubt there are good servers and bad servers for loot based on some observations by some people, myself included found a Bloody and Two-Shot on the same server one day, those drops look pretty standard.
---
And Silo runs are no small feat. It’s hard as hell and I don’t believe  anyone claims it’s easy. 
---
When a nuke goes up now I’m thinking “wow good on you guy, your a badass” 
---
The worst thing about it is that some people duped a lot of stuff before it got fixed. Now that it's nearly impossible to get legs, there even wider gap between those who cheated and got away with it and the rest of us. 
---
My way of dealing with people like this is to just kill them until they leave. If you act like a victim you get treated like one.
---
also is it just me or does it not always give you water when you collect from a pump
---
It's a known bug.  Seems to be related to moving your character or doing things before the game is completely loaded.  Then once the game loads completely the controls are locked.
---
You can open your map, you can select fast travel locations.  You can toggle weapon changes and use stimpaks with the D-pad.  But you cannot move your character, camera, fire your weapon, open the pip boy, etc.
---
Only fix I have found is to just log out and join another server.  Then don't touch the character controls for about 60 seconds after you load in.
---
Hopefully they address these loading issues in the next patch.  It really sucks being locked in place when you join a server, specially if there are enemies near by or you happen to log into whitespring bunker in a nuke zone unprepared (I always don a hazmat suit if I log out in the bunker).
---
Literally everywhere, plastic is in everything you just have to pick up stuff that looks like plastic, any container that gives you anything else like antiseptic or fertilizer gives you plastic. 
---
I know you offered him some cool melees but I am also looking for some fun weapons. Specifically 1 handers. Even more specifically if you have a Shishkebob of some kind. I am on Xbox. 
---
This is what I do, works everytime, as long as I'm outside the 24hr refresh window from previous sales
---
And just a note.  I find this to be my easiest daily route:
---
Flatwoods -&gt; Sutton Station -&gt; Whitespring Station -&gt; Enclave Bunker -&gt; Watoga Station -&gt; Watoga Shopping Plaza -&gt; Harper's Ferry.
---
Usually I loot the Military Wing of the Enclave Bunker to get Technical data and stop by Camp Venture before going to Harper's Ferry.
---
Seems pretty efficient for me.  Bunker to Watoga hop is the most expensive.  I think I spend about 80 caps total fast travelling, and usually walk to Sutton Station from Flatwoods (even though it's only a few caps).
---
Just get something from r/fo76bazaar
---
It feels so much more like a challenge now than before. Pre last patch if you had Tse and a full suit of PA you could run them solo (would still be a pain and withought healing factor, radicool, and ghoulish you would eat a ton of stimpacks. I used to save food with good with salt and cook a ton of it right before it expired before I did a silo just because I knew I was going to be taking alot of damage.) it is honestly one of my favorite things to do in 76 and you feel so awesome just blasting through hordes or robots. 
---
Make sure yo're well fed and hydrated before you collect water. The bonuses they give to disease resistance are pretty noticeable.
---
If it is a legendary enemy they can mutate up to 3 times which makes them heal all their damage and adds mutations to them. 
---
Sorry not everyone is positive and thinks like you I suppose.
---
I feel cheated enough by Bethesda's rich executives that I feel justified in this endeavor
---
Truth! How else would I have gotten my trouble shooter golf club or  hunter’s neckerchief. 
---
That bulk not mods
---
Interesting, did not know about that act. What country does that apply to or is it an international act?
---
maybe on the toxicity side. I'm just pulling your leg here, I most definitely am a toxic asshole. you don't even need to feel bad about calling me out on my lifestyle.
---
but I refuse to concede on something I know is right. the factual odds of rolling a god legendary are a (unknown) multiplicative of 0.0006%. just accounting for the ranged weapon variety alone this number decreases to 0.000015%. another fact.
---
these variables do not improve, they only get worse. fact. so it's no absurd extrapolation to say that, when accounting for every unknown variable, the number is close to 0.000001%. or worse. hell, it's only one magnitude lower than the % I came up with above, using known variables. if anything it's a conservative approximation.
---
so next time point out a flaw in my math instead of just saying I'm wrong.
---
seen a minigun sitting in the middle of the road in Watoga once too
---
Wow 👀 Am I looking at a giant set of dick and balls on this Scorchbeast?? Beast mode has a whole other meaning now! 
---
Why are you saying RIP to Battlefront II? Thanks to that backlash over the loot boxes the game is better than ever, it just took awhile to get to this point though. You level individual classes/Heroes to upgrade your star cards by playing the game and the only microtransactions are **cosmetic skins**. Anakin is coming this month and a conquest type mode is coming in March. There’s still bugs that haven’t been patched but the game is great now.
---
Artificial difficulty, do the grind boi 🙃
---
Im 38 and did the quest about 10 times before completing it, now its the 2nd or 3rd stop for me on all my toons, the squeakers on my team did it about 15+ over 3 or 4 days. 
---
What is removed??
---
Do it!  A group of 4 in tuxs running around will be a sight for other players.
---
I have the Blackbird paint and as much as some people are begging for it to come back, I'm somewhat torn...  its a little too environmentally worn down for my taste.  The Tricentennial paint is a lot cleaner.
---
It would be hard to do that since "no NPC's" is part of the "main story" if there is any
---
And for Western loot grinder players. Fallout 76 is a loot grinder, a very bad one because the gameplay loop is horrendous so getting useful items is the only feedback. There are no unending useful materials, no visceral and satisfying fights, no benefits of levelling up more, that make it feel like a worthwhile effort even if the right loot doesn't drop.
---
To be fair, they did nail the "ill, laugh, love" sign.
---
Apparently I doxxed you by posting that imgur link without blurring the name. My bad man. I know it's going to be easy to track your real name with such a basic username. God forbid one of the 4 people that upvoted this is hackermam. 
---
Do you want to make this Rust in the Wasteland? What's next - being attacked by a rampant vertibird?
---
Well with your pacifist on it should have been your cousin to initiate it. I think it's quite possible to do accidental damage to other players. It can be that it was your cousin who did the slap, it remains for a while. And you also said there was several players attacking you as well, again, the target can be either.
---
Contesting a workshop would also aparently initiate PvP even outside of that workshop.
---
Mechanics aren't really clear and they are hardly the way a lot of players like them to be.
---
I had eighteen copies of a very large base.
---
I still have a few people at my work that won't touch FNV cause it was a buggy pos as launch lol
---
Actually, I think he's part-time.
---
Wait do you have a link? I believe you, I just wanna read more about it.
---
Omg thank you so much for this information!  Thank you everyone, this changes things for me!!
---
Yeah honestly im at the point right now where im just loggin in to sell stuff between resets while i play other stuff cause my stashes are all full. 
---
Furious and Two-shot are both prefixes, so yes, the video explains that it was considered. There were some shortcuts in the OP's calculation, but that wasn't one of them. 
---
Oh thank god...thanks for taking the heat off my 3 bases..todd Howard just made a u turn..lol
---
You are conflating "people" with your own demographic.  Granted they should look at their demographic data and provide Atom comment based on that.
---
I push right on the d-pad for stimpaks, isn't that faster or no?
---
Or is it left? Hmm.
---
Well hey when the player count drops by half, we can have double the storage, right?
---
It's a meme haha, as much as we'd like to think it's one person it most likely isn't.
---
It was only 1 player attacking us.
---
I haven't used my real name online since 2006 so I think I'll be fine. this is also just a random nick, I have several handles to avoid situations like these.
---
Ok, there are 346,410 three star legendaries.
---
Where do you get  0.000003%, i.e. one chance in 33,333,333?
---
I bought the slicked oil and just picked up the pink. For a raider themed character both are great skins. What makes them acceptable to me is that the rough texture of the metal still shows through the paint. I'd like to see some paints for the actual Raider set though. 
---
Did not many people play Nuka-World? The Pack are by far my favourite raider group in the Fallout series. Doing my best to live up to them, even though they don't exist yet, I guess.
---
We are neighbors through dimensions!  Check out my post from a couple months ago, same spot!

---
no, they are all for show except for powerarmor helmets
---
I don't minimize what people deal with over ever the tone people use is that this is something that everyone deals with. Rather then what it really is. Isolated incidents that happen to small numbers of player. Who collectively complain making it seem like it is a bigger problem them it is. Amplified by people who don't have those problems by repeat it over and over again. Usually as an example to shit on Bethesda. 
---
The juxtaposition of my game play with minimal issues compared to others who apparently have so many issues frankly dosen't make sense.  If it was just shitty programming and shitty servers then I should be so free of theses problems.
---
The only bugs I run into is being occasionally unable to pick up select items off the ground. Which was a problem in FO3, Skyrim and FO4.  The consequences of that bug are non existent and easily ignored. 
---
So I wonder why I deal with so few and why other deal with so many.  Particularly on the server because I live in an apartment complex with a communal box that restricts internet speeds. And my wife uses wifi that is routed though a router configured as an access point. Because the ISP router was so shitty the wifi couldn't reach the living room.
---
She had constant trouble connecting to Destiny 2 and tends to lag a lot on other games. But she too has almost no issue with FO76 with server disconnect. 
---
Aha oh okay. I remember someone went into like specific detail and I was like damn.
---
Okay, I thought several since you said they respawning or something lke that.
---
I actually stopped doing this event because of this.
---
None of the games were "fantastic", you almost always have an irrelevant, unengaging main quest, heavy balancing problems and also a multitude of bugs. What they do though is offer a great basis for modders to fix what needs to be fixed and create a well rounded experience. 
---
And my memory tells me that the more we progress with the TES and FO releases, the more bugs we get. I was unable to play FO 4 for months because it would always crash despite owning an obscene rig which has cost me so much my wife almost divorced me. Many people having had the same issue and no fix was in sight for a really long time.
---
If anything, FO76 is only the logical continuation of a series which is going on for years now. This doesn't bode well for their next games.
---
In addition to that many things which happened were an outright audacity. On one hand there was Bethesdas greed, starting with paid Steam mods over the creation club which is basically the same thing just with a new name and Bethesda pointing out how it's not paid mods when it's exactly that, to the atomic shop in this game where a single skin can cost between 8 and 20 bucks. The price this entire game should be at release.
---
On the other hand there is Bethesdas disrespect towards their customers. How can Todd Howard enter that stage am joke about how he heard their games had a few bugs and then say that FO76 "just works"? The gall needed to do this is beyond comprehension to me.
---
This is not about having a developer with 5 excellent and one bad game, this is about a developer with 6 increasingly bad games where the last one reached an outright unacceptable condition. And there is no excuse like "the games are good but somehow lost their mojo" or "they tried something new and failed", as those are legit reasons to fail in a creative industry. It's like a TV series or a book series or something, sometimes you just can't connect to your initial success. But in the case of FO76 it's neither of those reasons, not really at least. One could say they tried something new with missing Npcs, but every primary school kid could have told them that idea is dog shit. The rest is simply lackluster execution, and that's unforgivable. An idea can be shit, but if you execute it well most of the time it won't be terrible.
---
A proper execution is a thing you can guarantee though. If you fail it's only a matter if lacking effort, care, means, resources or will. Or competence. But at least for the last point we know it's not true, they have shown before that they are capable of making decent games with a negligible amount of bugs. That's why it has to be some of the other reasons. And if they want my money I expect them to at least get a proper execution down, then I am more than willing to forgive an idea which simply didn't work out. But wanting my money without even really trying makes me go into "fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice..." -mode. 
---
The good memory of how nice your cell mate was to you the day you arrived is worth very little if by now he developed the habit of dropping the soap every single time and asking you to pick it up. If living in the past works for you and keeps you happy, good for you! But many of us focus on current developments and those don't look all too rosy. 
---
Because I enjoy the game don't like it? then don't play it dude.
---
are you on xbox?
---
More likely it'd just be inconvenient for the devs to implement, they'd need to duplicate all recipes that use dirty/boiled water
---
I want to craft lead lined gloves so I can collect water without having to pop some rad away. Or how about a legendary bucket drop that can actually be used to collect water. 
---
Gonna try this thank you! 
---
I think it’s just laggy sometimes. 
---
&gt;\- Friendly fire will heal your teammates if you burn them
---
This makes me wonder if a suppressors flamer will heal them but lower their damage output when you use that perk card
---
Just wait when this gets patched out and the same bugs still remain. Then we'll have to wait for our water again.
---
While the new content is nice they have had since July at least to work on it and it is still coming out really slow. The new heroes are bugged, not to mention tons of bugs that have been in the game since launch. Also, the new gamemode sounds like it is gonna be delayed. They've had about 7 months to work on it so it should be nearly flawless with that amount of time.
---
Pvp isn't balanced at all and will not be anyone soon.
---
Thank you and everybody else who responded! I'm definitely going to buy it. I only get to play on weekends due to work/life responsibilities, and this weekend I only have time to play Saturday morning. 250 isn't so bad, and hell, I got the handmade plans before the price increase, so I owe those bots some love!
---
*there seems to be a lot more interest in this game from the player community than its development team*
---
YES. Because we've each invested a chunk of change into it. Not all of us want to walk away and we're holding out hope that Bethesda isn't all smoke and mirrors and they really will produce a fully functional game with interesting content.
---
Meant Charleston in place of ~stanton~ sutton.  Looks like I'll be wasting less caps on fast traveling from now on!
---
No problem bro. Get those caps
---
I use Gatling which has decent damage, large capacity, can prop up its fire rate and sustained fire doesn't decrease its accuracy like with the .50 cal and the Minigun. The drawback is the ammo cost on steel/lead. LMG was practically useless, even the pre-patch two-shot variants I've tried.
---
Press X to doubt.
---
My trick is fort defiance. There is a bathtub there with water in it. It's dirty water not toxic. Collect 100-200 waters then very close by is a stove you can use to make boiled water.
---
Just make sure to have some wood in your stash. Also loot everything while ur at it.
---
Before I got a bunch of water purifiers I did this every 5th defiance run and never had any water issues at all.
---
Upvoting for awesome.
---
IF Bethesda released a free-to-play game, of course people would play it.  
---
Free-to-play is a virtually guaranteed model to get people to play a certain title, especially one made by a major studio.  Doesn't mean it'll be a good game, or that people won't bash it on social media, or that they'll abandon it quickly if it sucks.  
---
Bethesda absolutely will see future sales decreases because of Fallout 76.  It has damaged their reputation among the gaming community and even hardcore Fallout fans (like myself).   Pretty much zero chance I'll preorder the next Fallout game because they've lost my trust.  I think a lot of people feel this way.
---
[My original post can be found here](https://www.removeddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aq6d3g/if_you_compare_the_anthem_subreddit_to_this_one/?utm_source=reddit-android)
---
A lot of people were upvoting my post and agreeing with me, which they absolutely hated, so they decided to delete my post even though it didn't break any of the rules. 
---
that's why the time to stabilize and the blast area is severely limited. Or it could even make a diluted strain of the flux meaning you'd need to get x amount to equal 1.
---
Can we stop pretending they cut the game loose and aren’t communicating with the sub (which they run) or forums (which they also run). 
---
The game has been out for 91 days (or 13 weeks) has had five patches and two additional hot fixes. There is another patch scheduled for the 18th February. That’s roughly a patch every two weeks since launch. 
---
They have announced a PVP-mode Beta starting in March. If that goes live on the 31st March that’s 19 weeks after launch. 
---
We’ve had Inside the Vaults, Patch Notes, and Hot Fix Notes, issued via the website and echoed around the other channels. Status updates on downtime or server issues via Twitter and Facebook. 
---
And; they reply to tonnes of comments, requests, bugs and other posts on this sub with a fair frequency. 
---
You may not like the communication, agree with that they are saying, or not hold it in any value, but they are communicating. 
---
&gt;Bethesda doesn't really care
---
This is closer to the mark than we realize. FO76 is a dead man walking.
---
And grind the disease cure.
---
There are attributes to invest stat points in than there are staff.
---
I've been pretty lucky myself.  Two Bomber Jackets (sold the first to a vendor before realizing they were somewhat rare?).  BOS T-60 paint, two 1* Legendary level 50 Heavy Combat arms, one Zealot's, one Ghoul's (-15% from Scorched and -15% from Ghouls respectively).  And while not super great legendaries, BOS modded they are a nice upgrade from regular crafted Heavy Combat.
---
Not to mention a steady supply of Stimpaks.
---
Yeah I don't know how they spawned back in since they weren't on either of our friend list. Maybe they had a friend hiding as an anchor nearby but not as a party member?
---
Doubling the stash size again would be great. Bethesda could even do it as a reward for finishing the main quest line.  I'd also settle for better tools to see what weights so much in my stash.
---
* I know that you can sort by weight, but I think it just sort by the weight of a single item.  e.g., if I have 100 water, it sorts by the weight of 1 water. Not 100.
---
* I also know about the add-on that makes it possible to show category weight (e.g., it will show total weight of Weapons, or Aid, etc). This is a **huge** improvement over vanilla FO76. But it just works for what you're carrying. It doesn't work for the stash. 
---
A lvl 50 50 cal machine gun with all ranks of heavy weapons expert .heavy barrel, and bloody mess can do 74 damage per shot so it can tear through shit fast.
---
This raises the question of why you would accept a team invite from some random you've never spoken to.
---
give more use then, you could choose to use it on an enemy or choose to get some flux without having to go through an entire nuke event.
---
I'd settle for Bethesda's enthusiasm for the game that matched Bethesda's enthusiasm for their Atom Store. 
---
They need to delete flare guns, syringers, drills, and wood fucking armor from the loot tables. Having a three star drop a lvl 25 troubleshooter wood left leg is disgusting. 
---
OMG, this is so disheartening. This is winning the lottery level of chance to get a good 3 star legendary. /sigh
---
I have killed 2 of them now. Little bastard attacked me last night while I was fighting a scorch beast in cranberry bog!
---
Carnivore doesn't help with spoiled meat. But with Herbivore you can eat any spoiled items, including meat.
---
Without player vending, even a 1600 lbs stash will get full
---
Two thoughts: 
---
1. In addition to no legendary dropping, it's possible for enemies over level 45 to drop below level 45 loot, which makes the odds of a max-level best-affix drop even lower. 
---
2. Many players aren't looking for perfect 3 of 3 affixes, but cannot even find build-appropriate one-star legendaries (right weapon + right prefix + right level).  The odds of even getting one or two "right" properties on the "right" weapon are daunting. 
---
I have been seriously enjoying the game. But not a patch in what? Three weeks? Zero communication on anything.
---
Seems like they just want it to die because marketing and executives aren’t making their money. 
---
I have seen many different systems, and systems evolve to combat RMT or real money trading. I have observed what seems like symbiotic, and almost interconnected relationship with game companies the the RMTers. When currency, gold, whatever is difficult to obtain in a game, RMT flourish. When items are super rare and difficult to get same thing happens. When duping is possible then that just adds a whole other element to the supply making it so much easier to meet demand for lower prices. Some games have certain items being bound to the character or account. Some have no trading items. Some have their own system of converting real world money into items or currency. If the game provides reliable ways for people to acquire what they want, currency, items, RMT fails to flourish. So when a game intentionally makes it difficult to acquire currency and items, it's almost as if they are promoting such methods. Because real time spent pointlessly grinding for little to no return is worth a lot more than a few $$$. That's why I'm very suspicious about games like this. Like Lineage 2. Like WoW. As if there was some kind of relationship between those companies selling items and currency and the developer/publisher or parent company or whatever. 
---
I played the Anthem demo. How many community managers BioWare throws at the sub isn’t going to factor in on whether I buy the game or not. 
---
My first encounter with a scorchbeast was when I was level 5 or so. Since I'm originally from WV, I was super excited to explore the map and see all these post-apoc renditions of places I'd actually been to. as a result, I ended up in areas that a level 5 has no business being in. Anyhow, scorched are swarming after me and their flying monstrosity is screeching overhead and I'm running downhill as fast as I can because I know my little pipe pistol isn't going to do jack. At the bottom of the hill I come to a road and across the road is a cave.  Perfect!!  There's no way that winged nightmare will be able to get to me in there!!  I dash into the cave, feeling rather smug about having cheated death despite my dangerously low health, and run smack dab into a Deathclaw which finishes me off with one swipe.  fml.
---
All we need is a cooking/chem lab recipe that lets us craft boiled water with purified water. Would be really nice if it didn't cost wood, since you're basically just downgrading the water. In order to directly cook with purified water, I think they would have to duplicate every recipe that uses boiled water so that it has a purified water counterpart (like how there are multiple disease cure recipes). Also, allowing us to just "scrap" purified water into boiled water could work (since we've seen how stable and easy to patch the craft/scrap system is, so I'm totally sure a bug where 'scrap all junk' turns every drink in your inventory into boiled water could never happen.).
---
^ this!  It’s the loop of what you do with loot that’s broken at this point 
---
honestly who gives a shit, just go on playing the game, those players game play doesnt have any effect on your game play does it? half of the shit in the 76 bazaar is duped, and if you want to be cheeky there is literally a perk called "super duper". 
---
The irony is the issue with TSE's wasnt duping it was bobble heads and magazine stacking them well past slap damage. 
---
Is there a reliable way to farm technical data?
---
yes but i would drop the effective range even more in that case, just because the yield would be smaller.
---
You carried stable flux into battle?  I have a hard time feeling sympathetic when there was a stash right there. 
---
It looks like someone is holding santa at gunpoint.
---
Lake Eloise is a 2 minute walk away? I assume you are camped at the junk pile? 
---
Applies to the United States but also things that will want to sell here so basically it will apply everywhere.
---
Gimmie
---
You already can do that ;)
---
Yesterday my Mr. Messenger glitched into Riverside Manor and was stuck there...
---
I am not expecting the game to survive a year. Unless they hit one out of the park with the next update, this game won’t make it a year. If they roll out another disastrous patch, last one out, turn off the lights. 
---
Hmmm... I think we all are really, we just play as men to throw people of the scent :)
---
*MMORPG:  Many Men Online Role Playing Girls*
---
Although FO76 isn't really a mmorpg. 
---
To answe 3. The people with a tonne of caps are either dupers or generally high level players. Before they nerfed loot into the ground if you farmed SBQ enough you'd tend to get a 2/3 star legendary at some point that you aren't using/need. You then just go and sell the item for like 3-5k caps. If you got TSE's you could charge a decent amount for them and people would buy them. It's not as easy now given they have nerfed/changed a lot of things to not only make it take more time but give you less reward so not really any point in doing it anymore.
---
I always get at least two from the Enclave Military wing desks.  And many times I can loot them 2-3 times a day.  I think the key is, if Technical Data isn't in the drawer, don't pick it up.  Come back later and the drawer may have Technical Data instead of what it previously had.
---
(Though, admittedly, those Cigarette Packs for Plastic are tempting).
---
Unless they equip ghoulish 
---
It’s really fiddly and hardly worth the hassle.  I follow a few groups where players advertise ammo for sale.  The amount that never get a response shows why this functionality is needed. 
---
No one player wants 1412 rounds of .38 ammo.  They may want 400, so let the user sell the other 1012 to the vendors. 
---
So what?  Resources are infinite.  People need to start acting like it instead of hoarding and complaining about weight limits. M
---
That'd be a terrible idea, vendors lose money so that people can't just buy items they want then sell their hoarded junk/ammo to regain ALL the money they spent. With very hastily respawning shit, caps/trading would be ruined way faster than you think and in a non-repairable way.
---
Im playing a character to look like and be skilled like a Leprechaun.  My main is a harley quin looking person.
---
He will start talking about it after a 5 minute talk about all the controversies Fo76 has gone through. Thus getting the video that could be summed up in 1 sentence up to 10 minutes.
---
Thanks. This was always an annoyance. 
---
I was really hoping it was a song
---
Corruption is the go-to when you can't deal with the truth it seems
---
Fo76 needs to be completed, fixed and upgraded into sometime new. Then re-branded as Fallout: West Virginia or something.
---
The name Fallout 76 is so synonymous with crappy horribly bug ridden gaming experience that this game will never be taken serious while still having that name.
---
This is a deep hole Beth put themselves into and it will take a lot of work to get out of. I just do not think they care enough to get this turned around.
---
I can’t disagree stuff is coming out slow and the bugs. And yes the mode was supposed to come out this month with Anakin but they delayed it so they could include new reinforcement classes to the game for the new mode and GA, which are most likely Clone Commandos and Commando Droids but’s that isn’t official yet.
---
I like it. No reason to limit it to super mutants, options could be available to become a ghoul or scorched, as well.
---
Here ya go [https://www.magnumandco.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/super-computer-nerd-580x3481-e1379439793236.jpeg](https://www.magnumandco.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/super-computer-nerd-580x3481-e1379439793236.jpeg)
---
It will say in the atom store description which ones you can apply it to.
---
It should be T-45, T-51, T-60 and X-01.
---
And not Excavator, Ultracite or Raider
---
That would be on brand for Fallout ;) 
---
Anywhere with the light blue rounded file cabinets likely has them. I farm Monongah power plant, the Charleston Herald, RobCo Research, and I have found them in random safes and other containers. I hear they spawn at VTU, but I've never found one there (likely already been looted by others though). If you find one, turn it in before you grab another (and just come back for the other to turn in as many times as possible versus turning in as many as possible all at once).
---
The. Game. Doesn't. Belong. To. You.
---
They literally owe you nothing, what else around the game do you know nothing about?
---
Thanks for the info. I have not had my controls so absolutely disabled before. its super annoying when I don't have a long time to play and have to waste 15 minutes logging in and out 
---
Yes, I've never wanted to be wrong about something more in my life 😿😹
---
Same here. Enjoying the GG quite a bit. I try to only reserve it for nuke zones or tougher enemies though due to the ammo drain that you mentioned. But with fully ranked Martial Artist + maxed Bloody Mess + maxed Heavy Gunner perks it really throws the lead fast and hard! ( That's what she said) Before anyone else says it ; ) 
---
solo sniper only.  Too many stompy PA suits ruin my damage output.  :-)
---
Adjust your tinfoil hats boys, we're going to space.
---
Really? Almost all I see here is people complaining about how much they hate Fallout 76 and Bethesda. So, there's even more that isn't getting through...? Damn.
---
Get the Marine Tactical Helmet plan. Those things sell for 27 a piece with 4 CHR, IIRC, and only cost a tiny amount of mats. 
---
If you’re on PS4 I don’t mind placing it in for you, it’s great :) 
---
All the Stims and 40mm rounds you can carry!
---
&gt;	Creating a multiplayer game is not a significant technical achievement. 
---
Yeah, they just need to recompile the engine, but ticking the “add multiplayer” box. Piss-easy. 
---
People say this like it's a problem.  If new editions of Skyrim didn't sell, they wouldn't be doing it.  My wife wanted to play, we didn't have the PS3 in the living room, so we bought a new copy for the PS4.  She played 200 hours.  Well worth it.  
---
My daughter wanted to play on her PC, so we bought a copy.  300\_ hours in, every major quest line complete over 4 characters.  Well worth it.  Especially since we game shared over Steam and I played 100+ hours on it.  
---
Lighten up.
---
What's the over under that Beth scraps updates and makes the game into a wasteland royale?
---
Yeah, I haven't logged in but once since last patch.  I may do the uninstall and wait till they get something more in the chamber (not talking about that damn PVP either).
---
Thanks for that, I'll keep scrapping then, pretty boring, but I want stabilized for my new found night vision handmade will make selecting targets easier.
---
You do understand you got what you paid for. You are expecting more and expecting Beth to give it to you to keep you happy. That's not how purchasing works. You bought a game, you've probably played hundreds of hours in the game, you got what you paid for.
---
ah!!! this i did not know! thank you so much!
---
Bethesda has produced so much shit the past few months I'm surprised they haven't died of dysentery. 
---
And yet I killed a legendary protectron with little or no effort compared to a deepking mirelurk  in watoga about 3hrs ago and it dropped two legendary items.
---
Ps don't get too excited I'm lvl86 and it dropped legendary LVL 10 items 
---
Bethesda would make a killing with power armor skins and weapon skins hell even basic colors for power armor would be great or packs of 3 paints from fallout 4
---
If all the posts that criticized this game were removed from this sub... this sub would be empty.
---
It is how the game treats items. They are not just rendered as a text file they are kept in game. This means the server has to keep track of each item as well as players and mobs.  Which pretty much burns up all the RAM on the servers. That is my guess based on their feedback.
---
The cap stash isn't the problem. It is players abusing the weight system.  In all other FO games when you hit your weight limit you move at a crawl. Here they still give you the option to move at normal walk pace at the cost of AP. Which allowed players to carry far more then ever  intended.  Which is why last update put a hard cap on max weight while still being very generous. 
---
And because you are not bound to a single server each time you join it has to load all those items onto the server.
---
Thanks for the info, at least I've got the mod when I find a Combat Helmet, searching for that too, have some locations just need to sever hop a bit.
---
I have to know, why is this question being downvoted by  50% ?   is this a particularly touchy subject for some people? What makes them so upset i asked this question they needed to downvote it? what am i missing?
---
this is great, thanks for sharing!!!!
---
Or I could just get it at my camp instead of walking 2 miles and then being overburdened on the walk back... all while passing a scorch fissure each way.  I'm not sure your way is better...
---
Got my first Flatwoods Monster in the Mire and at level 50 and immediately after came upon my first Mothman, so I think it obvious why I find your adventure so interesting.  My second FM was about 30 levels later, also in the Mire, but no Mothman.  One interesting observation I've made is if you see an enemy glowing with a pinkish mist or haze about them, it means they have been struck by the Fm's energy weapon so look around and you might get lucky and find another FM to fight.  This happened with my third sighting  (lvl 150) with some Ghouls at Clarksburg in the Toxic Valley, but the FM teleported away and I could never find him.
---
Agreed..
---
ah, tonight i'll try this, but some of these places i havnet found yet :)
---
This website is full of pussies that can't handle and inconvenient truth and would rather eat up convenient lies. I hate it so much. It happened to one of my other accounts at filthy casuals. I asked if anyone could direct me to a FO76 exploit and they said talking about how to do the exploit breaks the rules. I told them I just asked where to go, I didn't want to discuss it there and they banned me. 
---
Fucking knobs on this website I tell ya
---
agreed that would be cool. 
---
Yeah I think Anthem will fill the hole that Chromehounds left when it died. Yes, on paper, it has the same concepts and systems as Warframe/Destiny. But it just feels and plays totally different. Similar to the OG Fortnite and PUBG argument I suppose. Same on paper, very different in-game.
---
oh man i wish i would have know this last night lol!  I really do appreciate you sharing this info!
---
So, I run an unyielding/bloodied melee. It's made the game both more challenging and fun
---
Bring back reloading benches from new Vegas, turn poop ammo to useful ammo
---
Thank God I hated collecting it. I don't understand why I can't use purified water for good that needs boiled water. Make it a buff or something if you use purified water instead. 
---
That would be cool!  I also think the bear skin rug should function as a bed.  
---
Every post is a criticism. What are you talking about?
---
Hopefully you wont get banned like someone else did for crafting too many weapons to learn more mods.
---
&gt;it’d be nice to hear from the actual dev team
---
Team??? ROFL. 
---
No idea how to implement it but what if there was some kind of serum that for an hour granted a significantly high chance of legendary drops being a specific **item** (effects still totally random)
---
In theory you feed in the components/ingredients into a machine as well as a non-legendary version of a weapon or armor piece. Machine turns out a serum which boosts your chance to get legendary versions of said item for an hour.
---
Make it require rare ingredients to make. Flux, blight, toxic goo, whatever, plus one base version of the weapon or armor.
---
Would it be lore friendly? Probably not, but I think it would go over well with players if they knew they had a better chance to get a legendary lever action or whatever else they might really want.
---
Heck make an alien NPC offer the service or something if it’s too lore breaking at first glance. Whatever they can do to improve the system I’m willing to entertain 
---
The Deva aren’t directly communicating with us for the most part, most feedback is funneled through the community manager who relays it back to them. It’s honestly a whole mess
---
I use my GG for SB/SBQ mostly where it really shines with *Stabilized 3, Martial Artist 3, Heavy Gunner +35%, Gunsmith 5, Adrenaline 5, Bloody mess 3*. It's also Vampiric so I can unload into the queens face ;) and easily heal back her melee attacks in Excavator PA. I do Super Sledge in Whitesprings and use mostly Handmade everywhere else.
---
It could get messy when you add the MIRV to it as well
---
Yeah the only daily I've been able to do is cop a squatter and I only do that one unless its at glass cavern. Because that's just too damn annoying.
---
I know but I thought they are still random at certain vendors only. Like the enclave won’t have those mods, but Chad can have them. Unless that’s all changed
---
Adding an if/or to the recipe would resolve the issue, and its real stupid or wasn't done from the start. 
---
&gt;if the player has X purified water OR X boiled water, then...
---
Ah, "test or holding cells from the same two developers," this could be a nice source for clues. And it made me think: Who is the lead writer for F4 and F76? Emil Pagliarulo, right? If there's one person who can answer if this crazy theory has any water or if it's just delusion, it would be him...
---
And yes, the "guidestones" are on our radar. Actually, Curtis Wilson could be a key element, since he already did a lot of the leg work. (Actually, his character is probably there as a proxy for the players, which I find neat!) I bet in the future there will be a way to unlock his case files. In his terminal, there's 2 things of interest: "Atlas" and "the mysterious signal." Did you go to those big antennas (the NIRA and the Astronomy Research center)? Something fishy was happening there, which makes me think... aliens! *insert Giorgio A. Tsoukalos here*
---
People have been asking for this since November, its not gonna happen. But hey, at the very least... energy weapons still have the durability of wet tissue paper...
---
I forgot how that's a good thing...
---
Ya.  New characters will have a hard time gaining access to more than just Responders and Raiders factions.  Everything else is in high level areas or locked behind high level quests.
---
It's difficult for a new player to make it to Whitespring and beyond.  I remember when I was a lower level, every time I tried to make it to Whitespring I would end finding a Scorchbeast guarding the main road in from the south.  No matter what.
---
And Harper's Ferry and Watoga I didn't reach until I was on the storyline missions that took me to the North East and then worked my way down South.
---
Yeah, keyboard/mouse on PC here and it's dead easy. Glad I don't have to try it on consoles.
---
However, the one near Flatwoods where you have to jump a lot? 10 tries and gave up entirely on that one.
---
Yes, that's a good point! We should keep that in  mind! =]
---
If you don’t mind me asking, what level are you? 
---
Fun detected.  Implementing Nerf in 5...4...3...
---
*They hated Jesus, for he told them the truth.*
---
Seriously, I've played this game like 5 times and each time I was able to find far more ammo than I used. If I can do that in a 1 hour session, these fucking morons who actually play it all the time can keep a steady loop of kill-loot-upgrade.
---
Too much immigrants from r/fallout.
---
I keep telling myself I’m going to make an alt with high endurance one of these days. My main has 3 and I get more diseases than a bareback prostitute 
---
No, I made it at a chem bench and was trying to get out of there. Nobody just brings stable flux into a battle. Unless it just gets thrown into your inventory like after a queen battle which I've also experienced losing queen stable flux as well. 
---
melee weapons are the best stealth weapons early game if you dont have access to some one that can twink youre character. Otherwise anything you find that has a stealth mod on it is effective sub 50. 
---
I used a silenced pump shotgun which was pretty sick for killing things with headshots around level 12 that too me though to 20 where i said screw this and went full melee. 
---
What is this "fast travel" of which you speak? I always have encumbered status.
---
As far as I know that is still the case. But I'm trying to compile a list of "I want plan X, so I need to visit Y vendor" stuff. I *might* work on the randomized mods at some point. For now though, I'm focused on the 100% stuff.
---
You have to get rads to collect dirty water, forcing you to use radaway, and an extra wood to boil the water. It forces you to do more work and use more resources, that's all.
---
Yep, 100 % true
---
Just a lot of bitter a-holes and elitists on this sub my dude. Some people still know it's just a game. Don't let it get to you. Kids just be mad at BGS
---
So I’ve had this thought.
---
And I haven’t seen it happen.
---
What’s to stop someone. Say. Me. From going around and capping every vendor bot in town. Can I kill graham and the Charleston vendor?
---
That would be so messed up.
---
I feel that. I don't mind using my real name because I'm an open book for the most part and if someone tried to steal my identity they couldn't do anything with it anyway. My credit is blown as is and i have a mountain of bills so my money is gone the minute I get it anyway. 
---
I used to do the same, and for the large water purifier placement. Then I moved to a water-less CAMP because of an acid vent. My only regret is having to use the dang pump. Still have plenty of purified water, with just a small purifier. (Not diluting stimpacks anymore, big part of the reason why.)
---
I watched him talking about the game on last years E3, would be interesting to see how he will spin it this year. I was not really impressed by the show, but (paid?) people in the audience almost wet themselves, would like to see them now.
---
Most likely, you won't last because it's Bethesda. They have a long track record of being a bunch of bastards who overwork and underpay their lack of a staff. 
---
That sounds like so much fun
---
You don't generally need to boil rainwater in real life to make it potable.
---
Everything I have at the moment is 2 handers, although I frequently get shishkebobs. So I will keep you in mind. Also if you want someone to grind legendaries with let me know 
---
Gamers are the type that would shit in the sink because and then tell you how crappy your sinks are cause they clog when you shit in them. 
---
I'm pretty sure that the forum moderators may get sick of people repeating the same exact shit as the next.. those may get deleted. Oh look, a new feature (next 40 people write the SAME exact "disappointed" description in a slightly different way, thinking they are saying something new,  when they could have just added a reply to the first guy).. clutter man!
---
We already know they don't have any problem using copy+paste. I'm sure someone on the team can also Google search how to replace 'Boiled' with 'Purified'.
---
I honestly don't understand how people can't see the writing on the wall for this game.
---
 It's a commercial failure. Bethesda won't be throwing good money after bad. The idea that they will invest the huge resources necessary to fix a game this badly broken for a player base this size is so unlikely as to be laughable.
---
Man I wish there was a 10mm rifle
---
Wondering that too... the few objects I do want to have I can easily buy from the in-game earned atoms.
---
Don't rush into the quests - without spoilers: Rose can get you into a heap of trouble quickly and laugh at you the whole way (the little brat). 20 - 25 should be decent for her quests, but do a lot of exploring and side quests first. NW Forest is a favorite, and the Toxic Valley has got some tough, but not unmanageable, critters to practice on.
---
Hey, that's a good point about the Hornwrights and the Garrahans! I haven't thought about it! I'll edit the post with your thoughts! Maybe the Shroud Head is "good" and the Metro Man "bad"? Or maybe is some kind of yin yang thing? Good thinking! Finding the Shroud Head in F4 should be a priority at this point.
---
Ah, yes, the excavator is a Hornwright thing. Gonna go check it out again, I've been there only twice, I think. And the ultracite explanation... damn, I have to go back to read the terminals in the Glassed Cavern! hhaahah Thanks for pointing it out, I'll edit the post!
---
I don’t think Todd was thinking that through. 
---
Todd why would I buy your MTXs If I can just mod my own?
---
Which brings me to a bigger question... will Bethesda try to shoehorn in MTX in Starfield and ES6? 
---
If so, how does that work with Mods?
---
I like the idea of more "class" options but it may strike an issue because they'd have to change all of your hitboxes if you become a super mutant.
---
It's not a killing blow to the concept but for each additional "class" they add, more special considerations have to be made as to how well they interact with the world as far a collisions and how things like crit regions would change or your camera perspectives.
---
I just want some plates, forks, crates, cups and other decorative items. Not this Fortnite stuffs!
---
I had two legendaries just vaporize last night; no corpse to loot. Not sure if they fell into the ground or what. Both were on paved roads, so it isn't a case of not finding them in tall grass.
---
Nice!
---
My way was to quit and go play a game that I was actually having fun in. 
---
With the existing buggy coding, would it trigger the scorched earth event if the prime fissure is mini nuked? would the game crash if the mini nuke is used in the nuke zone creating a paradox for the game engine?
---
In any case I wouldn't mind if a mini nuke would created post nuked zone like what you would see after a nuke drop dissipates. Tougher enemies, plants to gather for flux...
---
That being said, a mini nuke in current game mechanics has the same effect of an artillery strike or an orbital strike grenade. I mean at the nuclear silos if they had the option to get a special mini nuke instead of initiating a nuclear launch, that would insure that it remains rare.
---
Wait is there seriously a pink armor paint?  Is this a joke?  Tell me it's a joke.
---
It rarely shows the quest.  You just put 'em in the slot and then it says it.  It's an infrequently marked quest, I guess?
---
Does it matter how many you turn in at one time? I’ve tried turning in one to turning in multiple, but normally get 40mm ammo and stimpaks.
---
How many do you turn in at once?
---
I've noticed the pink mist on other creatures (Ghouls) before and there was a FM nearby.  I wasn't able to kill that one as he teleported away and didn't reappear.  I assumed that they had been struck by its energy weapon, as I observed them attacking the FM.  Saw a bunch of ghouls and another player at The Whitesprings lately covered with the pink glow/mist and immediately went looking for a FM, but found nothing.  Didn't catch the other players tag to ask him about an encounter though.  
---
Damn! Nice dmg on that. Probably similar to the 1 shot assholes I've been greifed by in PvP lately. Not implying that to you btw, in case you were wondering. Just had a random melee guy that killed me over and over the other night. Slap dmg took ~90% of my health down, and like an idiot I retaliated. Almost got him twice. . . But alas 10 stabilized violet flux and a few hundred caps down the drain, lol. Oh well, chalk it up to a learning experience. 
---
Thanks for the snapshot of your build though. Very interesting!
---
The fact that the weapon you're scrapping already has a mod attached means nothing in terms of learning new mods. It doesn't improve the chance you'll learn a mod at all. Odd thing for me was how long it takes to get specific mods for some rifles and not for others. I know it's somewhat random, and the more mods you know for a rifle, the harder (percentage/chance) it gets to learn others, but it took me forever to unlock the suppressor for the hunting rifle, while the handmade gave me the four mods I really wanted  in four tries (so much screw scavenging though!).
---
Yeah but they can control most of them with their downvoting shills and fanboys. When the real criticism starts to get up there it's time to shift from operation damage control to operation meltdown.
---
My character IS a bareback prostitute... the plague mutation is wonderful.
---
Hotfixes should be for critical things and done **fast**. Look to Warframe for an example of how to do hotfixes right. Any big critical errors on a patch released tend to be corrected *very quickly* in a day or two at most.
---
You really don't want to mutate into a Centaur.
---
Point is, you knowingly put a rare junk item into your inventory while in a dangerous environment. 
---
Sometimes, enemies levels are dependent on where the event/quest is located. If it's the part where you have to go to the wendigo cave, you are better off doing something else until you have better weapons or a higher level.  Remember, none of this applies to Scorchbeasts. They start at level 50.
---
Are there any recipes in the game that work this way? I don't know of any, so it seemed like they would have to make major changes to the crafting system to allow for that.
---
The enemies in a zone are scaled to the level of the players that first enter them.
---
Starting areas (The Forest, Toxic Valley, and Ash heap) have max level caps on enemies, meaning if higher levels go thru the area, the enemies spawned will be slightly higher, but still capped.
---
Areas to the east, like Savage Divide (top of the world area) The Mire, the Bog, can have much higher level creatures spawn.  So if a level 60-70 passes thru before you, and you show up, then there will be a bunch of high level enemies there.
---
Areas also have minimum levels.  I think Savage Divide is 20+.  And it doesn't help that the monsters around Top of the World are usually Mole Miners.  Much more deadly than your Ghouls or Scorched at a similar level.  Just because they travel in packs, carry dangerous weaponry, and usually travel with a "Glowing" leader.
---
The easiest way to complete the beams is to crouch while walking. Yes it's tedious, yes it takes forever, but it is better than falling and having to wait for the timer to run out and start all over. Thanks to the player that assisted me with the gift of this knowledge on Xbox 1.
---
Two bombers, four science scribes, two engineers, FOUR T-60 paints. In one day.
---
Question for OP have you Mutated yet?
---
I've always liked the game. Most of us do. We admit that..were criticizing it because of wasted potential.
---
Blindly whiteknighting is bad for the game. 
---
Well okay. Gonna explore a bit. Just thought i could go with my regular bethesda game routine of; Quests first exploring later. Buut i think i can mix it up a bit. Thanks for the help.
---
Got protected from guided meditation, seems related to events in the region for the under armor in question.
---
Nope. I have both Anti-Armor and Bloodied variants i use.  
---
I hadn’t really played either much, so my mistake. There’s a lot of things that feel right in 76, but also so many unnecessarily added layers that just designed to drag out gameplay. I don’t count cooking, boiling, crafting, repairing to be gameplay. It’s just designed to drag out the time instead of exploring and fighting monsters.
---
I would give Bethesda 1 billion dollars to make the new PvP servers mandatory and force all playerbase to only play on those servers.
---
Nice. Gunsmith 5 offers passive boost to weapons? I have it, but only ever equip when I'm crafting. What's the buff that it gives?
---
The worst place is the Mire because the roads are so messed up and all the roots get that fucker stuck all the time. 
---
I usually do 2.  If I know or think I'm not coming back, I will just grab every single Technical Data in the Enclave.  2, 3, 4, what ever is there, and drop them in.
---
I'll try this out. Thanks!
---
You got loot? I keep getting the spinny wheel but I can't use that for anything.
---
I'm always looking for low level characters to dump my low level legendaries on. Someone did that for me when I first started, and want to pay it forward. So few players seem to have voice chat that would allow me to ask what they need, so I just dump some assorted stuff. I ran into a level 15 player last night I was able to hook up. For the game to stay viable, we need to help out the new players.
---
I love the Bolstering Armor, Adrenaline Mutation and Bloody Weapon effect, because it makes you stronger and tougher the lower your health goes but dont realy needed to be low health or stand still like on sentinel. Its a nice allround set for the most situations :)  
---
What place do you usually run for legendaries? I have been having crap luck everywhere. I am on right now if you wanna do some runs. Msg me on Xbox, GT: Kaylila. 
---
I know a lot of people complain about Scorchbeasts being too hard to kill for the mediocre loot they drop, but I think they're pretty cool. There *should* be monsters that you normally just avoid or run from. It adds tension. When you're doing one thing, and then hear those wings flapping, you immediately stop and focus on the threat.
---
Yes, it's annoying when they show up at your CAMP or workshop, but when you just encounter them out and about, I think they add a cool element to the game.
---
The ease of which mini nukes can be mass crafted would make gathering flux kinda trivial.
---
Fuel should be crafting 50 ammo at a time instead of 5.
---
It's more material efficient to craft a completely new flamer and get the free 100 fuel.
---
Pls fix. 
---
BoS Heavy Combat armor gives the highest DR by a long shot over anything else.
---
Outside of that, choose the effects you want to have.
---
My rifleman build tends to run with Perception, Agi, Chameleon, etc.
---
Heavy Weapons build uses PA, so I don't need to worry about armor for him. In fact, I dont think I have ever met someone who uses Heavy Weapons not be in PA. Too many perks associated with HW and PA that are hard to pass up.
---
I have found this method reliable to the point of 3-4 in one visit sometimes.
---
Do yourself a favor only collect one technical data and turn it in, and repeat. Getting a stack does not improve anything.
---
Oh, hell lol. Yes, I forgot to mention those like an idiot. Marsupial, Healing Factor, Speed Demon, Egg Head, Plague Walker, and Bird Bones. Also should be obvious but those always lock down 6 of my Luck points for Starched Genes and Class Freak. Sorry I forgot all about that key bit of info, lol.
---
hahahahahahahahah
---
It's sad that I have to put "DO NOT NERF" disclaimers on my solutions that I tell people about.
---
I dare not speak them most of the time, for the gods will nerf them :)
---
Yes, you pretty much convinced me that those things are SB nests, like, they were "built" just like birds build a nest. Now I remembered this bird from South America who builds nests like this:

---
 Kinda similar! Could even had been the inspiration for the thing in F76!
---
Really? I've only gotten ultricite power armor mod recipes from the queen. I could have sworn that X01 mod recipes didn't exist in the current game
---
Hi! As others have mentioned, this is likely due to a bug that may prevent items from being crafted/repaired if your materials are split between your inventory and stash. We are currently looking to include out a fix for this in next week's patch.
---
Do only one at a time, the game does not register you having more than one. Anyone looking to challenge that can visually check this themselves.
---
that was me that told you it broke the rules, because it did. telling you "where" would be explaining how to obtain that information. pretty cut and dry desu 
---
Yeah, the last Inside the Vault was very disappointing.
---
Scorch Beast Scream frequency isn't even in the top 20 of the things I'd like to see in this game.
---
CONTENT please.  My friends are BORED.  They're leaving because there's NO CONTENT in your patches.
---
Cx
---
From what I've read, the best strategy to maximize your returns is to turn in one as many times as possbile rather than turning in as many as possible one time, if that makes sense. Some say you get more caps for more TD turned it at a time, but most of us are in it for the rewards (Bomber Jacket, BoS paint jobs, BoS Shielded plans, etc.).
---
Not yet , they release “new” content each week and toss a sneaky “limited” skin every now and then 
---
Ah, yes, that's the ultimate theory... I didn't even mention because I didn't want to go that deep, but... yeah, man, I bet there's some connection! =]]]]]
---
You don’t have to drink. Just spam the Collect water button. I easily pick up 60 in a few seconds
---
I've been thinking of adding Adrenal and Scaly skin to my list of current mutations. Just haven't pulled the trigger yet. Do you think the upside would be worth it for a non-bloodied build on those?
---
+ the 2 shot jeez rip servers
---
that, actually isn't a bad idea, or planes for flux enabled minis. this way you need at least some flux to produce more.
---
I have. Bought the 5,000 Atoms pack back in December. Don't regret it.
---
Should be a 1 for 1 exchange.  Turn purified water into boiled. Or 1 for 2.
---
CONTENT please. My friends are BORED. They're leaving because there's NO CONTENT in your patches.
---
Nope
---
Have you Crafted Underarmor to counteract any SPECIAL losses? For example I'm using Shielded 76 jumpsuit for the +1S, +2E,I,L. I mention this because if you craft a few different types they give different Stat bonuses that can help tweak things. :)
---
Don't forget the carryover from 4 of not benefiting from any armor reduction perks because they only lower normal damage resist!
---
\*Checks box.\* Hmm it actually says 1 player but PS Plus Subscription Required. But 1 player actually isn't an option.
---
Which perks in particular? Just asking because either I've never noticed any, or I'm simply ignorant or overlooking them. The PA and HW ones that is.
---
If that pink had been available for T60 PA, I would have gotten it.
---
So cheap and abundant at later stages that it makes more sense to drop ( or gift to buddy)then the time it would take you to haul to workbench break and re purpose.
---
It would be like in real like touching something more then twice for a single use it’s a waste of energy and time ( resources as well )
---
they cut their losses short!  lol.  gave up on the game real quick like.
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request. 
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited or however high they can get it (1,000, 10,000, etc). It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
Would have went home or to whitesprings to make my flux
---
&gt; Yeah, they just need to recompile the engine, but ticking the “add multiplayer” box. Piss-easy.
---
lmfao. You are incredibly stupid or incredibly misinformed thankfully or allows you to be both. 
---
have the need to use some flux as a modifier requirement to need to make it (the ammo) and so it doesn't get spammed to much have each one need a different flux each time you craft it
---
to me the problem is that it came off as disingenuous to a PVPer like myself.  "the biggest threat to the Project isn't any threat we'll face out there, it's from within" this suggests, like in other sandbox openworld pvp games, the other players are the end game content.  this is not the case with how 76 currently plays.
---
I have so much purified water whenever I see a new player I drop them 20.
---
&gt; fucking morons
---
Well that was uncalled for....
---
You need more than 24 players for a battle royale.
---
I completed it quite easy with an xbox controller on pc without any tricks or anything, and im not really amazing at parkour in games. I would assume its an old controller issue
---
Then why do I feel I get 25% of my drops are either wood armor or Junkie effect.
---
While ur math is sound I feel that some items have a natural higher chance to drop than others. I do not think legendary items or effects are weighed equally, otherwise I would have seen a lot more TS or Es than I have.
---
More like a old Ad&amp;d loot tables. The game rolls several time while determining what loot it gives.
---
But the cost of ammo for this gun is insane compared to the efficacy of the gatling gun. I carry both and only use the 50 cal on big slow targets.
---
&gt;People want to look sleek and badass
---
My clean tuxedo and fashionable sunglasses would beg to differ. 
---
Still waiting on pink power armor paint.
---
Alright I may be with you on that
---
Perfect storm ? 
---
My guess is they built a real good automated testing harness.
---
The game is an alpha/beta for future MMOs from Beth.  We're just supporting the development cost.
---
Same, I wanted to play with a friend. I didn't want to play with a bunch of random people in an empty world, but here we are. At least FO4 had living people in it.
---
1 lead, 1 steel per every 50 rounds, does that seem fair?
---
What are you thinking on the conversion rate?
---
Yes I have and am currently wearing the shielded 76 under armor. Haven't gotten around to the others, partly because the 76 one seems (perhaps I'm wrong) to give the best overall boost to skill points. It's basically counteracts all of my mutation negatives and then some since I have Class Freak maxed.
---
I know. I check the Atomic Shop everyday. I have everyday since release. I just don't understand why they would show a bunch of icons that aren't for sale yet. 
---
In what way is it uncalled for, idiots get called idiots.
---
my guess would be players who got beta codes, installed, but never played.  thats just a wild guess tho
---
That doesnt make sense...there is nothing in there...
---
Beta actions did not carry over to release trophies.
---
I once made a character and never left the vault because of a crash,i wonder if the game counts that as part of the 13%
---
Ehh, just seems pretty aggressive and rude. Not really following  [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). 
---
We are missing something lol I am going camping inside the vault 
---
Bethesda promised a glow in the dark map in the atomic shop, we got one.  The quickly established themselves as a company that delivers on their promises.   So now there is an expectation. They created the expectation, not me. That isn't my fault. 
---
The people from Bethesda posting here are not devs, nor have they ever claimed to be. Their job is to gather feedback to provide *to the dev team.*
---
The turrets are controlled by the rejected brains for the robo-brain project.
---
More like the people on this sub that were tolerant to the issues have started getting angry and opened their eyes.
---
Wait, did you think the poster you're responding to really believes you can click a multiplayer button and change an entire game? Was that not enough to appear sarcastic? 
---
If you look at the item it describes what armors it unlocks for BEFORE you buy it.  So the problem seems to be not reading the description.
---
Hum... yeah, I think I remember going by an unmarked church in the mire. Man, no idea where... I'll keep an eye on it.
---
Puck_2016 made a good point about the Hornwrights being "evil" and the Garrahans being "good." We really need to see where else the Shroud Head appears. If you see it, give us a shout! =]]
---
Player base:  "Fix the pathing of this event please" 
---
Devs: "You got it guys"  *Nerfs melee weapons
---
It's something to do with Beta characters.  Cause I have people on my friend's list who did not get the Reclamation Day achievement until 2 months after they got plenty of others.  I imagine they did the vault stuff prior to the release, then a couple months later made a new character for some purpose and got it then.
---
Ugh, I hate running through Watoga and seeing lvl 14/26 legendary bots
---
You dont understand Marketing and PR do you? They fucked up big time, and make us pay 60$ for a Beta phase of a game. Fuck yes we are entitled to get bug fixes and content. And if Beth doesnt do that, they will miss out lot of money bc nobody will play future Beth games. They had a good reputation and theyre fucking ot right now. 
---
Yeah, I'm aiming for Assassin + Poison Resist 2\* armor.  Pieces with Sentinel are welcome, but not that needed.  Radiation damage is welcome, because if anyone else is willing to use a radiation weapon in PVP then I'll take my loss.
---
What's annoying about rebuilding a decon shower?
---
&gt;clearly not even Bethesda themselves know what the game is at this point
---
How true. Poor old Barry the only programmer that's left running the whole show can't get a single piece of direction from his leadership. It's all fucked and it's not going to get better.
---
In Fallout 4, on Survival, you needed to have empty bottles in your inventory in order to collect water from pumps (which gave purified water) or open water sources (which gave dirty water). When you used a pump, your character would stand there and keep pumping until you either moved away or ran out of empty bottles. I don't really understand why that mechanic has been removed? 
---
There's a lot of people that buy games that will never play.
---
You can just spam the collect button without drinking on PS4 at a dirty water place (pond, creek, etc). Its nothing to collect 80-100 dirty water in less than 30-45 sec that way
---
Beta player. Never got the trophy. 
---
Here is the build I use for my heavy weapons/PA:
---
[HW/PA build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f337e59&amp;d=ic4ip2ih2l22ls2lt2id2a04s32sr2sq2sg2st1pe2ef2c13s00cm2&amp;w=&amp;n=Hvy%20Wpn%20PA%20Build)
---
Stabilized being the main huge one.
---
I play on x-box and it took me a few tries.  I dashed through the rest of the course fairly quickly, but then slowed way down on the balance beams and didn't pay any attention to the timer.  Ended up finishing the course with something like 12 seconds left, so it was cutting it close.  If you start to get frustrated with it, walk away and kill some super mutants or something for a while. The more frustrated you get, the harder it is to complete.
---
It would be great to add some things to the game to make it better, like the augmentation of CAMP budget, the reduction of the weight of everything that isnt junk into the stash, having more levels to improve the SPECIAL to be able to get more important perks. And the stash weight limit being pushed to, idk, at least 800.
---
Also I had some random idea, like the ability to fix the lack of companions by being ablie pet animals and beasts; and getting your last set at the workshops when you capture them, like in the CAMPS, but being more like FO4 settlements. (When you disconnect or have your workshop being captured, the item you placed goes with you and reappear when you reconnect or/and get the workshop).
---
Ive talked about on discord with some Fallout communitys and they didnt disagreed with me.
---
The game definitely registers a difference between 1 and 2.  If you pick up only 1, you get 350 exp for completion, if you pick up 2, you get 400 for completion.
---
But like I said.  I am only going there once, I don't care how many I pick up.  The Tech Data respawns the next day, so I don't have to worry about leaving them for me to come back to.
---
Then it still doesn't make sense to include perks such as Bear arms that allow players to reduce the weight o certain items by up to 90%.  And changing that structure should still be their #1 priority of transitioning the inventory and stashes to a different system, and it should be communicated that this is what they are doing - or communicated that they plan on leaving it like this so hopes of increased stash sizes should be quashed.  All we have is "looking into it" and "maybe in the future" - we as players need a roadmap. 
---
The endless notes and holotapes taking up space isn't probably helping things, since they have zero weight, but all have their own item renderings since many notes have custom images.  
---
Again, if the issue is that the game has to keep track of all these items and players carrying more than # of items was going to cause server issues, then giving players ways to carry more items was a dumb idea to begin with, but they did it anyways.  
---
Their system is flawed, and they should be fixing it.  
---
The second FM there were a couple Scorched with it that were the pinkish color, that was kind of cool, it is like he scorchbeast turning the people.
---
Also playing in APAC and have only run into griefers while playing US hours, also the accents give them away.
---
&gt;played a different game last night
---
YES. I played co-op Far Cry 5 the last few nights. It's such a breath of fresh air.
---
Having a self-identifying bot automatically provide an "empathetic" response seems like a really self-defeating plan, but somehow is not surprising for a developer who populated their MMO with robots and corpses. Well, and Graham, the only actual character in the game.
---
WS must be the place to be.
---
auto handmade with a drum is much better "Heavy" gun
---
Ok but my post was completely new and original. It was pointing out how BioWare is completely responsive to their fans on anthem, and Bethesda is exactly the opposite. I guess the truth is against the rules now huh?
---
Could be like the crappy cheevo recognition that the Xbox one has. I got my lvl 50 achievement before I got my lvl 25 achievement. And more still have never popped for me. 
---
YEA, hate them almost as much as the mole rats
---
Well I feel like scorched wouldn’t be a good pick because their a diseased creature, whereas ghouls and supermutants can retain personality and the scorched follow the hive mind.
---
If you hate the game,  the players,  and aren't even playing anymore.... why are you even here? 
---
Always good to see people here, with a master in software engineering &amp; development. /s
---
Even when you say it as a joke, about "recompiling the engine" it already shows that you don't have any clue about what an "engine" actually is/what it consists of and how it works. 
---
A lot of assets from previous Bethesda games were re-used, certainly. But suggesting 76 is an asset flip of 4 reflects a serious ignorance of how development works - heck, even how computers work. If you think inserting netcode into the Creation Engine was a weekend task (and that's far from the only significant change they made), I don't know what to say other than "you're wrong." 
---
Fallout 76 is built on an engine that's an iteration of the engine of Fallout 4. But even treating an engine as a singular thing is wrong. It's lazy and wrong to call the game an asset flip when the real crime is fundamental mismanagement on release schedule, content, and post-release support from an organization with seriously flawed management. 
---
The Gatling is the best boss fight ranged weapon IMO - best mix of everything you need for boss fights - ammo is plentiful with super duper and ammosmith, durability is great, sustained fire with 500 rounds means you hardly reload and even when you do it reloads quickly.
---
If you don't have heavy guns perks, trade or find a legendary 1\* Anti Armor variant.  This allows you to get armor penetration without Stabilized.  Always pop chems to increase your damage vs. bosses.
---
And for power armor - you absolutely should have Fireproof 3 to reduce the damage from the SB's scream spam attacks.
---
Yea I’ve noticed that the game has been running slower and slower ://
---
So?
---
Mentioned in your other reply, but just for other readers.  The game does register a difference between picking up just 1, or picking up 2.  You get more EXP for completing the quest if you have picked up two.  It resets to counting only 1 if you log out before turning them in though.  And having picked up more than 2 does not yield more exp.
---
Whether or not the loot chances are better with 2 would require much more data.  But the difference in EXP upon completion of 1 Tech Data vs 2 Tech Data is clearly visible.
---
And yet it doesn’t matter.
---
Because you and your whiny voice don’t matter.
---
Also the Fallout: Miami mod for 4 looks very promising.
---
I am right along with Cheffy3166 - I am still having a lot of fun at level 87 doing Enclave events, Breach &amp; Clear, and just searching around and looking for interesting things to kill but I do find the lack of communication disturbing.... I am having Star Wars Galaxies flashbacks at this point.
---
Ah, I see. I'm going to have to chk out Stabilized and Adrenaline tonight for sure. Seems harder here lately to get a good test on builds as I'm not seeing near as many nukes getting dropped in the last couple weeks. Maybe it's just me though.
---
Very very good its my primary gun. I find it accurate at almost all range, the problem is you have to get use to how to aim it. The sight is a complete lie, you have to know where the sweetspot is. Also there is a way to fire the gun almost double as fast if you time your trigger pulls really well, there was post with a video a while back and it basically doubled my DPS. Make sure you use the heavy gunner perks and more importantly Stabilized. Armor penetration is extremely important in late game and Stabilized really really makes this gun great.
---
Iirc you can collect dirty water as fast as you can press the button at a stream/pond/etc.
---
Sent. You'll find things a bit sparse at the moment as we are just setting up shop. It's just me and another dude and a small skeleton to hang data on as it's discovered. It will be great to have your input!
---
I didn't think they could do that...THAT is a whole new shits-capade to think about.
---
Haha, yup. Just got it on a new character and have nearly 2,000 ammo for it. 
---
It was a beta thing alot of the early trophies never unlocked on full release.
---
Dibs. Sent you a DM
---
It could get you banned from subs or Reddit as a whole. Just saying.
---
Plus it's just rude. Be a human being. If you can't be civil, head back to 4chan.
---
That’s the way to keep us coming back even if it’s for 30 seconds...
---
I do check as often as I can because I have some love left for it yet lol
---
I did the VIP demo weekends on Xbox (or tried to). The first weekend was totally botched, I never actually could load in to a game during that weekend. What followed was EXACTLY the kind of response and handling of the situation that Bethesda did not do during Fallout's BETA: EA posted a handwritten letter from the head of Anthem's design team informing the base exactly what went wrong, exactly what they're going to do about it, took complete responsibility, and offered an extra free cosmetic item to everyone at launch. The second weekend, I spent roughly 3 hours in the game and was immediately impressed by the fluidity of controls, endless customization for paints and metallic surfaces on your armor, stable servers and game client, ethical micro-transaction structure, and gorgeously polished visuals. Bethesda could take a page from the customer service response here as well as taking pride in a well-designed, balanced, and stable experience. Everyday I find myself standing in an increasingly barren Appalachia just wishing the 22nd would hurry up so I can spend full price on a game and feel like I'm actually going to get a full-priced game.
---
Thanks for the info, I'll give a try. :-) 
---
Yes, sadly. 
---
She works at the studio part time and works as a Lyft driver after hours. Apparently she's just trying to get her BA in CompSci.
---
has anyone tried jumping in the FEV tanks at westek and see if they mutate? I thought about it one time but figured it might kill me... thinking back I think one of the terminals or tapes or something said they used some chemical to make the FEV inert
---
Agreed!!
---
Scientifically how many rads and pressure do you need to turn a blackberry into a radberry?
---
Yup. Reinitiating trade usually does it. If I still don’t see 200c, then I’ll buy/sell something cheap and it’ll refresh. 
---
Ya that’s why I usually don’t like these types of online games. They focus so much on making people play longer that it just turns into a grindfest. Instead of adding enough content to keep people engaged for longer, they add meaningless mechanics designed to halt your progress.
---
Somebody made a video showing all the plans vendors are selling now. I'll try to find it and edit this post, if I can't, I'll upload the screenshots I have with all the stuff.
---
you cannot duel wield.
---
you can favorite different weapons (I do not know the ps4 button for this) and then used the dpad (i think again, not sure on the console buttons) to swap between them.
---
This is a terrible idea. 
---
This would become the number one way to grief players and makes zero sense.
---
Go on people you have recently seen, or been in with you on a server
---
Is this the hacker 4chan?
---
Yeah, I know that but my camp is no where near any puddles or rivers. The amount of times I find myself stuck at my camp dehydrated due my lack of foresight and preparation is too often that i care to admit. This is actually a really handy tip to get a bunch of water in pinch out of my shitty water pump. 
---
Thanks for trying to teach me something though! I appreciate that you took your time to do that although I was already aware :)
---
Lore reasons: It is only available from West-Tek (at least in West Virginia), and the only FEV source in the area was in the West Tek research center. The FEV vats in the facility were neutralized a couple of days after the bombs fell for safety reasons.
---
Gameplay reason: It would change the general mechanics too much, all the assets would need to be remade, etc.
---
I feel like they made most paths require dedicating substantial amounts of perk cards to really see how it works.  Just switching between guns while keeping a loadout for something else like a particular type of gun, or melee, etc means you never get the actual feel for how it would be focusing on that type of weapon.
---
My sister was given two free days of ps4+ with install. Also think pan is giving away a free month of ps4+ currently.
---
At a pump?  This is not true.  It's about 1 water every 5 to 10 seconds for me.
---
I don't think you can do that anymore. Won't let you.
---
Yes!!! Please - It would be nice to have to show off Legendaries that are either total crap or totally awesome
---
Want that paaaiiiint.
---
The "Unable to Sync  " error doesn't seem to be connected to numbers of friends for me. It happens regularly to me and I have like three friends on there! lol
---
Exactly! My friends and I have put so much time into the other Fallouts. We just wander and explore and fight things. It’s still fun. What’s not fun, is being unable to focus on the notes, terminals, holotapes, etc because enemies are always showing up. Then having to manage two unnecessary mechanics, then having to deal with bullet sponges, which means I have to go back and craft ammo, food, stimpacks, etc. it’s demoralizing and prevents me from actually playing the game.
---
Right! The game is on the trajectory and it will ONLY get worse as more and more resources are moved off the project. 
---
If the first 4 months of post launch have not satisfied the players than it is completely unreasonable to think the next 4 months will. 
---
How much content will one of their vaults deliver? 5 or maybe 10 hours? 
---
The players who care will be done in two days with it and then they will go another 4 months for another vault (if the game isn’t scrapped after the first vault release). 
---
This game isn’t going to all of a sudden have better communication, resources allocated to it and better quality patches. 
---
There's a sulphur fountain at Whitesprings that cures 1 disease every time you drink.
---
1. Fast travel to the golf club house.
---
2. Turn to the right, go through the tennis court.
---
3. Once you're through the tennis court, turn right.  Then walk 20-30 feet.
---
4. Look to your left.  You'll see a circular stone gazebo looking thing with a bunch of bushes around it (about 20-30 feet away).
---
5. Go there and drop down into the gazebo.  Look for a drinking fountain that says Sulphur Drinking Fountain.  Drink.  Free disease cure forever!  I really never need disease cure anymore.  Just stop by there while I'm running around.
---
Hope that helps!
---
This post is about collecting water from pumps in camp.  I don't have standing water at my camp.
---
Right 
---
which is clearly not allowed because you're not allowed to criticize Bethesda or is it developers here. Only constructive comments and praise for them are allowed
---
LET ME BE A WASTELAND PRINCESS, DAMMIT!
---
If we didn't drop unneeded ammo all over the place, there'd be nothing left for the Vault Dwellers that exit a couple hundred years from now :P
---
Because I'm waiting for the updates that make it worth playing (to me), even though it's shit as is, it's a fallout title... I really want to enjoy it like I did the others.
---
I was reading you in Slav accent 
---
My understanding of marketing and PR have nothing to do with the conversation. Your sense of entitlement is astounding. Unless you are 15 or under you need to get a grip. "Make us pay $60" who made you pay for it? Did someone come into your house and point a gun at your head?  "Fuck yes we are entitled to get bug fixes and content." No you're not. Will they for the PR of it all? Yes. Have they? Yes. Are you entitled to it? NO! Damn this whole sub is so toxic.
---
Then someone mini nukes the prime for fun and surprisingly spawns the queen. Gets patched 3 months later. 
---
Reduced weapons deteration.
---
Very true....cycle of life 
---
I will say, that you're right. I should have made the flux elsewhere. It's not about the flux though it's about being able to get revenge/your stuff back. IMO having a player marked similarly to calling in supply drops. I don't like the current mechanic for supply drops but think it would be perfect for dropped junk on death.
---
Could be an interesting addition to factions if you're part of a hive mind. Give bonuses to grouping, and small firearms. Scorched still talk, so they have some intelligence left.
---
I started my main during BETA. as other pointed out, achievements that you already earned did not trigger retroactively (for the most part).
---
im more curious about the other achievements. there are so many people alleging that they have exhausted all content already, and that the great majority has as well, but when i get simple achievements for events, or even the main story line, I get a "rare achievement." On Xbox, a rare achievement is one that less than 10% of players of that game have earned at the time you got it.
---
a few of the more recent ones I've gotten:
---
"Queen of the Hunt" - for the daily quest of the same name, earned 7 days ago, only 3.54% of players had done this by then.
---
"Good Grief!" - kill 20 players, unlocked 02/02, 3.26% of players
---
"Heart of the Enemy" - another daily, earned 01/27, 1.20%
---
"Scorched Earth" - event/final main story quest (kill SBQ), completed 01/27, 5.38%
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
So far, I have all of the Responder bots plan lists. Getting them entered into a Google Sheet for ease of use. I'll do the Raiders next, then Whitesprings, The Enclave, then the two in Watoga. Hopefully I bump into Graham and the Charlottesville vendor soon and can add them as well. 
---
Have fun !!! This is my 10 mm farming piece 
---
Thanks for the response - sorry I put it badly - I can only actually equip 1 weapon - when I use Pip-boy menu I can only actually equip 1 weapon and a grenade. I used to be able to equip 2 and swap between them but can't seem do it any longer. I was wondering if there's a glitch or if I'm just being dumb.
---
Was it night? If so, building a spotlight (using the home defense perk card) helps. If it's not night, or a range issue, then it's probably just the turrets being moody. Sometimes they just don't agro as expected. 
---
Only if we could have it play some slow Barry White tune when we use it. 
---
I find Whitesprings loot to be quite odd of late. Level 68 legendary ghouls only drop level 45/50 items about 20% of the time. I understand that the most desirable items are small in number relative to the possible pool but why is a level 68 enemy dropping level 10 loot?
---
my fashionable glasses disappeared yesterday as well.  Not as big of a deal as PA i understand, but still, shit really is disappearing from our inventories!
---
Okay so what about flux you get rewarded when you kill the queen? Do you deserve to lose that when someone takes your bag? You're missing the actual point, which isn't "reeee my flux" ( I know it's hard to not hear that) it's that "hey I feel like being able to know who took your bag could lead to some fun game experiences."
---
Yes its just random RNG. Mods actually have different rarity values. I had to make abut 40 cryolators to get the barrel I needed.
---
because you can undo it which has weird implications
---
Maybe if you make taking someone else’s bag a PvP Action. 
---
Holding the reload key to stow the weapon (or tapping it to reload) also cancels a charged shot on Gauss, at least on PC.
---
Yup wouldn't be surprised if they left this sub and moved over to r/fo76filthycasuals instead. That sub only praises them and Bethesda only likes praise. It strokes todds huge ego.
---
Why are you claiming 
---
&gt; My post was being up voted faster than any in this subreddit ever
---
The undelete shows you have just a handful of upvotes.
---
ah, gotcha... that is too bad! part of the reason i love gaming is the communities of like-minded people, and lot of other subs i visit for games seem to be very friendly..
---
its too bad people take it out on other players as opposed to the people they are actually mad at..
---
anyway, thanks for this message!
---
I do a similar route to OP, but would also suggest just outside Harper's Ferry there's Thunder Mountain Substation TM-01 (strong enemies, infrequent legendaries but worth the gamble), Treetops and the Big B Rest Stop down the hill. Those last two places in particular are where I've found some of my favorite legendaries. If you stick to the road south of the Rest Stop there's usually a glowing Hermit Crab right before the Galleria.
---
In Cranberry Bog there's a collection of trailers forming a tight square on the west side of Abandoned Bog Town where an Enclave event sometimes shows up, there's usually some high level enemies in there. Across the street there's the Old Mold Quarry which frequently has high levels/legendaries, at least in my experience. Bonus point: if you happen to server hop here, always check back to see who's guarding Abandoned Bog Town, there's a decent chance a behemoth shows up. 
---
For the agility test, I walk in a strait line until I reach a turn, and then turn my character at the junction without walking forward. I complete the test in 2:18, so you have plenty of time.
---
The Whitesprings resort is nice because you’re safe inside the hotel. You have to do quite a bit to gain access to the bunker vendor though. Harper’s ferry is pretty dangerous, but once you know where the vendor is you can just bee line to him and then hop on the roofs if you’re being chased. Watoga is also dangerous, but you can do the mayor for a day quest to pacify all the robots.
---
If you’re on xbox, add me and I can run it with you just to get access to them all.

Soon to be picked up by a YT or dosh news site and stated as fact...

*"Rumors are only one guy is now working on FO76 - source* *~~ehm not reddit~~*  *my ITK guy"* 
---
Alexa where is the nearest burn center? 
---
This trick where you get 10 dirty water from collecting from your water pump in your camp doesn’t work on Xbox in GA t it only gives you 1 but it is easy to get a lot of water fast from a dirty pond, creek etc 
---
Quiet. Do you want it to get nerfed?
---
That’s happened to me a bit as of late, legendary or not. 
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
Daily/weekly challenges, vendor runs, go to prime fights, occasional Whitesprings runs.  Don't really focus much on legendary farming myself.  Working on 2nd character as well now.
---
Sure they do, with class freak in hand is the negative effect on each mutation a big win against the small lost.
---
Adrenal works after the first 5-8% and stacks higher and higher  i believe (didnt remember the numbers from the guys who tested it very detailed)
---
Scaly skin is a must have for every "mutant" in FO76 \^\^ in my eyes,  I do not want to miss it anymore after i got them :)
---
and u dont realy need to be a bloodied build, the bonus is for all builds a nice to have ;)
---
(at first i wouldnt touch any mutation because i thought they will be so bad with the sideffects but after i learned the classfreak perk make them so small that its a joke that i DONT have any of them \^\^)
---
Good luck.
---
I'm up to 60 handmades, 50ish lever actions, and 20 radiums, and aren't close to unlocking them all.
---
Oh, the *screws*!!
---
I just want to find a Legendary Chicken, then I will stop playing 
---
Replying to your deleted comments bc i dont wanna waste time writing this again. 
---
If i would be the only one whining yes. But literally everyone with a brain knows how bad they fucked up and complains about the Shitshow Fo76 is.
---
Im sure you are one of those people who dont vote bc they think their voice doesnt matter.
---
Yeah they made money with the sales of Fo76 but surel not much. Do you really think people see Bethesda the same as before. People dont like to be fooled and those are the players that wont buy any future games. And that **will** hurt Bethesda big time.
---
Its not all about sales. PR plays a big role in the business. You not only want to sell your product, you want people to recommend you, to come back to you. Fo76s story makes people buy less Bethesda title bc they are unsure about it. 
---
Nobody made me pay for it. But if i pay 60 dollar for a AAA game thats not even functioning correct yes i feel screwed. If you think its ok to sell a Shitshow of a game and just ignore the players your damn wrong. FFS YES im entitled to get a working game!! 
---
Im toxic? Uuh this made my day. I was one of the few people defending Bethesda for the longest time. But enough is enough. 
---
You swap between 2 favorites using left d-pad. Up on the pad is your favorite wheel

It had 42 upvotes in 15 minutes and then was deleted before it could gain any further traction.
---
When I move my camp, first thing I do is locate a pond or puddle the game registers and then I spam the holy hell out of collecting. Haven’t done it in awhile so maybe I’ll get permabanned for water collection but I’ll nab like 100-200 or so dirty waters and then just crank out the boileds. 
---
Ah, no, when I say "we", I mean all the people commenting, like you do. So, "we" are you and me and the others who are chatting about it!!! =]]]]
---
Just curious, did you get protected from Guided Meditation since the last patch?
---
Awesome! I'll give it a look.
---
Just a note: if they are showing nothing in their inventory at all then it is this glitch just back out and in again. If they are showing items available for purchase, but 0 or very few caps, then they have a connected inventory to a vendor you already sold to that day.
---
Also, the cap limit resets every 20 hours. They will have more caps the next day.
---
It's in the name: Fallout. Dust, specifically radioactive dust, is in the rain water. Why do you think all ooen water sources give you rads?
---
it's blast radius wouldn't cover the entire fissure so it would't spawn the SBQ or just make it so that it only affects plants for flux.
---
My one star two shot gaitling is insane. Im in the process of collecting all heavy gun perk cards. Its fun as hell. I wouldnt have thought inwas going to go as a heavy gun build but its damage is better than rifles. Two shot gaitling is great
---
I fully agree with you on the communication, but I specifically wrote enthusiasm because that is what it will take to keep the community around while they do the patches and create the content you mentioned. They can create as much as they want, but without enthusiasm that matches the desire of the community, it will fall on empty ears.
---
i love how all those "people" went totally off topic, and bashed you for making your flux in a dangerous zone.
---
 So viele Arschlöcher, so wenig Kugeln.    lol
---
but i like your idea.  +1 from me.
---
I think that would be a very nice feature, but in the meantime you should consider moving from whatever popular spot you’re using.
---
I got swarmed by like 5 ghouls in Annie bunker once. Still confused on that one
---
Didn't know that, thanks for the tip.  Now there's no downside to using the holographic pip boy over the regular view... being able to reload while looking at my pipboy seems better than not being able to...
---
Martial artist 3?
---
Difficulty doesn't need to involve killing things. Killing things fast or slow doesn't make something difficult. There could be randomized or procedurally generated puzzles and objectives to complete. And replayability for items is the cornerstone of many dungeon running gameplay loops. Doesn't matter how easy, trivial or difficult it is. People will do the same crap over and over if there is a chance to get something, and the process is at least slightly rewarding when they don't get that main thing they want.
---
WHAt do you mean?
---
wow, toxic much?
---
I know who you are. Hail Sithis!
---
Yeah but since people can’t remember shit it’s not a bad way to beat the dead horse as a reminder that the company who manages this game deserves no loyalty 
---
For someone who has openly said that you didn't even buy the game, you sure have a lot of opinions about its game play.
---
&gt; Granted, nothing here was all that fantastic, however the number of legendary item drops is definitely higher than I've ever been lucky enough to see in a single pass through the Whitespring blast zone (\~25 minutes):
---
OP was referring to the number of drops, not quality...
---
Privjet, Slav-bot.
---
You leave my radworms alone!!!!
---
Reminds me of my H1Z1 Days.....lol
---
Sky base activate!
---
That could also be a blessing for everyone, because it takes a lot of time to keep up with a community like this. And we want the devs to focus on what they're good at - developing. 
---
I feel you! This build was actually made because of griefing. I can constantly trade kills/caps with people 100+ levels above me (currently 150) I've started saving level stacks because I know this going to get nerfed eventually. My group and I generally try and help people (dropping plans, weapons, aid) I've started escorting players below lvl.20 around. I have noticed an increase of low level players just running away from me and it's like "NO! I KNOW THE MASK MASK MAKES YOU THINK I'M GONNA KILL YOU BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU THIS EXCAVATOR SET!"
---
The number is also pretty standard.
---
Lat night i had my fashionable glasses just disappear off my face... and i didnt sell them or scrap them!!!
---
I like to help new players do the story missions and grind , I want the game to thrive , I want players to have a good experience with the game. I am signgorilla on ps4. 
---
At the very least, a dedicated power armor station, where we can store multiple suits for display, would be great
---
sure, if you know where they all spawn.
---
Don't accept team invites from randoms.  Don't use workshops unless absolutely necessary.
---
Whenever I get a daily atom quest to take a workshop, I do it, then immediately log off the server so I lose the workshop.
---
I haven't had this problem.  But I admit I'm actively avoiding it.....lol
---
What a valued response.
---
Thanks - I'll give it a try!
---
Do the legendary supermutants that run away from you count?
---
the 76 by your name leaves open the obvious possibility of you are old as shit and need someone to change your diapers.
---
just kidding gramps! 
---
They are not going to release details because then we'd all know that they've stopped working on the project. That is, we all pretty much already know this, but that would be the final nail in the coffin. They need to squeeze some more ATOM's out of the corpse before that happens. 
---
I didn't delete anything... and can you even read, and what does voting have to do with it? "Literally everyone" do you know what literally even means? This sub, r/fo76/, is a very small percentage of their player base. And even only a small amount of people on this sub think it's as bad as you feel it is. Sure your points about sales and PR are well founded, but again, off topic to the conversation. Finally, and more to the point of the can you read comment, where did I say YOU are toxic. I said the sub is toxic. But to that point... You do seem quite toxic now. 
---
Wait you don’t want to run around in pajamas or in medical scrubs?  Stuff you wouldn’t even wear if they are free?
---
Who ever is in charge of their marketing decisions should be fired.
---
It's not one guy working: it's a whole group of people _not_ working. 
---
Oh, don't get me wrong, I love the stories told through the holotapes, terminals, notes, etc in F76. I'm more bringing up how goofy the game looks, and how absent the gameplay feels of the darker themes compared to the older games. Example, I played the original Fallout about a month ago and I died super fast because I didn't know how to survive in the wasteland. I got ambushed, was under equipped, and was overwhelmed. It made for a bleak experience where I felt like survival was difficult and actually succeeding was pretty satisfying. Bring in F76 and there are none of those elements in the gameplay. It's more run and gun. You literally have to try to run out of supplies. It would take conscious neglect to die in F76 outside of combat. And even within combat it's pretty easy simply cause you've got auto-stim and explosive bullets with double shot from a gatlin laser mini gun. It's just a different apocalypse these days.
---
You can just do this on open water. No pump needed. The pumps are really only needed if your camp isn't near water. You can just go to a lake and spam the collect button and get like 100 dirty waters in under 30 seconds with like maybe 10% of your rads going up. Less if you have certain perks.
---
Jesus fuck, did I actually need to add “/s” to *that*?
---
Stabilized only affects DR, not ER. Hopefully they fix this in a patch.
---
My fault. I didn't specify Power Armor in my first comment.
---
I know the meme, the meme doesn't make sense in context to the op. 
---
Yeah - the quest-lines get really hard really fast. Someone posted this map before:

Lol, same here. Last few times I've tried to give a care pkg, they either run the other way or look at me with a blank stare. Doesn't matter what I emote or jump around on.
---
&gt; warheads being made in the silos are loaded with something special revealed in the stor
---
Do you mind telling us? I did the story but don't remember that special ingredient. 
---
Don't know about the vendor bots, but you can drop a nuke on Graham and he doesn't even blink. Someone posted a vid of it.
---
Let alone he dies almost instantly.
---
What have you bought with the atoms?
---
That's one of my favorite things in the game. Except I bait them with a bounty, so maybe they think they are being the good guy. I don't know. I need the caps though. Sorry. Not sorry.
---
It's also almost a million times faster to just get your water from streams and lakes and whatnot.
---
Whenever I get parasites in-game I always audibly yell out ["I've got parasites as big as me arm!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEVYuDr-OTY)

Dysentery in-game is hilarious when you realize it's a notification that you pooped yourself.

I’ve placed Atom Shop items in my friends camps, it’s no problem

and I can only play for a few hours before being disconnected...so.....

Apparently not.  O_o
---
Plans for X-01 mods are not available (yet?). What you have to do is farm the enclave and pray to RNGsus, Calibrated shocks are VERY hard to find. Found 1 in 40 hours of server hopping the enclave.
---
Yep.  It should be able to be scrapped.
---
As for selling, I'd say allow it to be 'bulked' into Ammo Boxes (say, 100 rounds) and those could be sold to vendors.  And Ammo Boxes can be 'scrapped' to get the rounds back.  Ammo Boxes could auto-open if you run out of rounds...... or it could be that you'd have to manually open them.
---
Yeah. 
---
It's supposed to be a nice little way of explaining why the piles vanish. 
---
ALSO if you take the time to take over a factory, game WILL crash
---
As soon as anyone does PvP or camp damage, steals, loots or griefs, whoosh them to pvpland.
---
I love this so much
---
Not pump. Just go to a stream and collect a ton. Then trash that useless pump
---
No body give him satisfaction on more replies. He had his tantrum. Just ignore it and he’ll cry himself to sleep.
---
I stand by my previous statement that I want to be able to bulk legendary rolling pins 
---
I noticed this the other day. It's not just legenday drops. There are a lot of mobs that still show weight in their inventory after you loot them. 
---
I found that for underarmor you have to buy and learn the lower ones  before the higher ones show up on the list.
---
Lmao remember in FO4 there was that 5 shot Fat Man that you could mod with MIRV? Literally shot 10 mini nukes at your target. Extremely dangerous, but also fun
---
This is great tip, since it will at least put me two buttons presses away. Thanks, Trixeth
---
hi, i appreciate the info, and your generous offer to guide is amazingly awesome, but, Im on PS4-
---
:(
---
its nice to know there are still good people here though!
---
Could say the same about yours...
---
*Woah!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** Thecyberchill! ^(hug)
---
Oh noz! Please don't go (without giving me your sweet, sweeeeeeet lootz first!).
---
Yep. Scary part is you can collect meat and stuff from them and then cook it for food.
---
Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, Aaron's have a dollar value, so I can see where people are coming from when they say stuff on the atom shop costs $8 or $14 or whatever, but if they are going to look at it that way, they need to be fully honest, and add the disclaimer that Bethesda paid them $40-50, plus an additional $5-6 a week, just to play the game.
---
At this point I log in for a few minutes, realize I have as much interest in the game as the devs, then log back out. 
---
&gt; sometimes
---
Historically correct would be if 9/10 players were killed or disabled by disease, with the last hit by a shell.
---
FnordBear, I’ve sent you a friend request last week but you haven’t shown up on my friends list. Can you send one to me just in case I didn’t do it right. My IGN is Kraag.   Thanks!!!
---
Crank speed, and thus damage per second, is increased by 30% or so. I don't know if it is intentional or not.
---
I like having that new C.A.M.P. smell, don't know how hard it would be to get that perpetual dirty feet smell, or the stains out of the couch from someone else's.
---
You aren't getting better after 50 much outside of gear, so if you design it with that in mind levels won't matter. 
---
Responding to fluff first, huh?
---
With all of their actions so far, I honestly think they're cutting their losses with the game. Like, it will never happen, but i wish a developer (just *one*) would come out and admit this was released incomplete to meet inve$tor requests.
---
If they actually cared the tiniest amount and/or even stopped for 3 seconds to think about how to fix this, they'd realize utmost honesty is required moving forward. The fanbase deserves as much. Rather than fixing issues, being HONEST, and giving a roadmap for the game, we keep getting dumb stuff like rugs and other retarded atom store content/emotes nobody ever asked for in a fallout game. 
---
Meanwhile, the laser rifle still doesn't work, and there's no way BethSoft haven't play tested this and know about it. How hard is it to adjust damage? bump up some values across maybe 20 items? that would take a day, at the very most. Its like the game was released in mid alpha, its just ***not finished***. They are either so misguided and out of touch with Fallout fans that this game is doomed, or they flat out do not care anymore and have the bare minimum of people working to support a triple-A title, just 3 months after launch. There's no real, *good* explanation for the company's behavior and handling of this whole thing. 
---
Tagging /u/lonevaultwanderer and /u/bethesdasoftworks_ for the off chance one of them will address this beyond the "we hear you and have passed this along to the 2 developers left on the team, more info coming soon. Please check out our new curtain rods on the atom store™" canned response
---
See my edit.  
---
Good job! I understand words with multiple syllables can be tough for people in your position but you've learned a lot! You get a gold star for effort. :\^)
---
See my edit.
---
With SBs you gotta weigh the risk to reward.
---
I’m a lvl45 stealth rifleman and bullets are expensive AF.
---
I’m now seeing a lot more of them and more frequently.
---
I’m unsure about their loot drop as a reward. it seems like it wasn’t all that great on my tank main. So, I’m very cautious about where I throw my bullets at.
---
And automatically strip you to your skivvies when you lay down on it. Also, instead of the normal sleeping pose, you should just continuously roll back and forth.
---
And you get a downvote for yours! Isn’t learning great!?
---
They're just one good patch away from saving the game, or another bad patch away from another shitshow. Reboot not required.
---
I know it was dumb of me to sit so close but I was bored and wanted to see if I could position it well enough where I was just outside the blast zone of the Nuke. I didn't have much luck as you can see. 
---
The bag I dropped I later tried to pick up but I wasn't able to do so. It only gave me the option to search my own ash pile but no option to pick up my bag.

hi me in the background i deconect the server 3 foix to join a friend and then my reapplication on the server i lost 2000 stimpak my fat man legendary 3 star and 36 different serum don 2 of each this is really sorry please settle problem thank you
---
Yeah, I thought the option to place it next time you logged in was fine, and I like seeing other camps that use the same spot as me. If you have to server hop for 10 min, you should maybe try somewhere else
---
Lore-ways it is much more likely to kill you outright, turn you into a centaur, turn you into some kind of failed mutant that can't survive because it doesn't have a mouth or at best turn you into a hyper-aggressive "normal" super mutant.
---
Im sorry i thought that was the same redditor. If i say everyone i dont mean this sub per se. Its the general public opinion. Fo76 didnt really get an overall positive Feedback as expected. The casuals are the mayority of the playerbase yes, but if nobody shows how bad the game performs, they think they can get trough with this kind of shit. Is just not ok to release a game in such a shitty state and its unnacceptable for companies like BGS. 
---
If you felt my points about PR didnt add to the conversation, im sorry but i felt it fits. I have a talent to digress tho. 
---
You said this sub is toxic based on my comment so yeah im assuming you think im toxic. Otherwise why would you bring it up? 
---
Highly doubt it that they would develop a whole new engine for a side project (very costly) and not their main projects (which will use the one we have now). 
---
I wouldnt mind it if he didnt start every single fallout76 video he makes like that. I always end up skipping to the meat of the video.
---
&gt;Adrenaline
---
 Adrenaline is good for groups. Each kill resets the 30 second timer for the damage bonus.
---
Or you could just not accept invites from strangers? 
---
Seems like the big van that says free candy woulda been obvious..
---
You poor dumbass.  It’s not about the robots.
---
Fuck.  This  bullshit only screws lower level people trying to sell max caps each day , which isn’t me.
---
It’s about the fix in general.  I’ll list it out for you.
---
1.  They put time on another nerf instead of time on fixes to real game breaking things, of which there are so very very many, this alone shows what they’re up to as I originally stated.
---
2. They did it just to continue to prop up their shit forced low cap limit by denying vendor access, and in a way that fucks those who are most hurt by it- sub level 50ish players who are likely new and desperately need caps since they didn’t dupe like 75% of the people still playing.  
---
This is the only bos vendor in game.  If this was a “needed” fix, they would’ve also added a bos vendor (copy paste style , which appears to be the extent of their programming ability) somewhere else, preferably west of the zone.
---
3. They took a mechanic that worked both functionally and thematically and broke it on purpose, which in a game so rife with utter shit in both theme and mechanics, is a big wtf moment in and of itself.
---
* to back this up, I’ll go a bit in depth on my thoughts here.
---
First, who didn’t smile at a bos robot shooting up rampaging bots that wiped a city out?  Fun, right?
---
Second, that’s exactly what a bos bot would’ve done, esp here.  We find reports just around the bend about bos giving up on Watoga for now,  meaning they had been fighting here as expected.
---
Just around the corner we find a tape from a bos scoutthat states there’s nothing to loot except robots, if he can figure out how to take them down.
---
Then we have a bos vendor bot.  Why wouldn’t he be there to support bos mission personnel and clear the area of hostile, plus pick up that loot bos already stated they wanted?   
---
When bos supplies max out and no one comes for them, why wouldn’t he turn vendor and sell, maybe from a backup sub routine, even if retail wasn’t his original purpose? ( easy lore, easy theme). 
---
This shit just works - Maybe he was backup for that scout who sent him out undercover to the next door market?
---
How easy is that?
---
Thematically and mechanically correct.  Bethesda can’t figure out how to do that themselves and even now we see they remove it when it’s done by accident.  Idiots.
---
4. This is by no means an isolated incident.  This is standard operating procedure for them. Unacceptable.
---
5. The entire incident, given the current state of the game, the many direct game breaking issues for players, and server instability, all serves to show they are either complete incompetents or are trying to sabotage the game. 
---
There can be no other conclusion.  These are the things that piss me off, since I got scammed into buying this, and fallout was my favorite franchise.
---
They need to give this ip back to the remaining Troika guys.  Fuck Bethesda.
---
I don't understand why when I have the Aquaboy perk and I don't take rads when standing in water, why do I take rads from collecting water?  I'm not drinking it?!?
---
Whiny narcissistic ranting, or various versions of "Bethesda, waaaaaah" =/= criticism.
---
:/
---
Damnation, you lucky bastage. All I get are water and 40mm.  :-/
---
Yeah. Rather messed up. I've got Lead Belly and Aqua Boy. I can drink the water, no rads. I can swim in the water, no rads. I can even breath underwater, no rads. Try to collect some, RADS. Usually just don my hazmat suit before collecting a bunch of water.
---
if your on ps hit me up. you can have all of it.

A centaur with marsupial and speed demon could be pretty fun to play and terrifying to encounter.

No no no i'm down on that boat with you, right there in the mud, that's where i'm atom.

Ok, and you think that is the fastest upvoted post ever?
---
I had that happen last night. 3 star ghouls only had a wrench, one had a pencil, but the non legendary ghouls dropped 1 star legendaries.

Liberty Prime: The Blunder Years
---
So your problem is that you enjoy bad games and most games are better than FO76?
---
They would probably need to duplicate all the cooking recipes, I don't think the ingredients list can handle an OR.
---
The only problem with this is that people who have duped ammo can easily get so much scrap and alot of caps 
---
&gt; Start fresh from ground up and not use coding from a older game to piece together a instance based version. 
---
You just asked them to make a AAA title for free...
---
I guarantee you no reboot will happen that you don't pay another $60 for.
---
And your a obvious clueless Bethesda fan boi who doesn’t get it, likely because you either don’t give a fuck about fallout or your sitting on duped max caps and gear.
---
Either way, people like you are the reason they get away with this shit show and your deplorable for it.
---
What?!?!
---
I've considering trying to build a camp over a body of water and setting up a decontamination shower to sit in while collecting.
---
Currently I have it so that you can have one foot on the pressure plate and stay under the archway connected to a powered door for an easy exit.
---
Not sure that's entirely true... it depends on how they partitioned the servers. If each server is a cloud instance that horizontally scales, you could have only 24 people playing and the server would still suck.
---
Lol....thank you Dr. for your prognosis, would you mind prescribing me with a fix for my obvious illness?
---
**Or**, no one really cares about why you're leaving FO76, just leave without the whiny bs?
---
They probably couldn't be bothered 
---
Don't forget gunpowder. When pulling bullets apart, it is reusable also.
---
I have no idea what the point of this post is.
---
I do have to say I've never seen anyone think here was spelled he're.
---
In the real estate biz, we call that "character." Anywhere but the Forest, you really won't notice the odor; bog stank, Scorchbeast guano, ash, toxic lakes...
---
Lol I don't share your pessimism but I find the ways of you two expressing your doubts very funny.
---
i agree, i on purpose have a CAMP in a popular place to help noobs and filthy casuals
---
every now and then i have to server hop, Id be ok with waiting a bit longer initially if the game would just not load until it finds a server I can actually have a house on.
---
WTS prime real estate! Cranberry bog mansion! Large pond with water purifiers, a resource extractor, well placed defenses and a handy dandy fusion generator! Only 15000c and this beautiful home can be yours!
---
&gt;Todd needs to step up and get out in front of this mess
---
That ship has sailed. The mea culpa should have happened a couple of months ago. Nothing to do now but weather the storm.
---
Every nuke silo I run will ALWAYS have at least one if you check all the blue circle filing cabinets.
---
You should buy another copy of Skyrim! 
---
I respect your effort, but that sounds like a miserable way to play a game.
---
I’ve run into slow servers and sudden disappearance of the SBQ corpse but wow 20 min is just way too long to watch the dancing circles 
---
I haven't seen that. I have seen it die few times even thought I thought there's time left.
---
NEVER attempt to ford the river.... Little Jenny always dies
---
I dont see anymore leaving posts and even when I did they were few. Mostly it's people calling out Bethesda and not being complacent little cult members while they fuck up repeatedly in every patch. Sorry if some people want them to do their best and make the good game we know they can.
---
You mean like the randomized nerfs.... omg this whole time the patches were the end game puzzles lol I’m sorry I had to make a joke about that.
---
&gt;I don't recall ever putting a game down after 20 hours and saying, wow, that was amazing.
---
So don't buy single player, story-driven RPGs.
---
Lol...good answer but I already burned up about 700 hours in that one as well.
---
But is it LEGENDARY dysentery? Lolz
---
No points for non legendary like rad or bone worms 
---
i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I've gotten 3 ultracite rusty knuckles and 2 ultracite vents. Not sure why so many of so few, but they sure are dropping.
---
It happened to me once as well.
---
I'd gladly trade "T-51b headlamp bulb not lighting up" for "T-60 Vault-Tec headlamp mod" obscuring everything with the image of Vaul-Tec Boy projected by the lamp.  
---
I won't lie, I'm questioning myself now. I'm hoping to do 4 or 5 runs tonight. If it turns out I'm wrong, I'll take it like a man :)
---
I'll record with Shadowplay in case though. Won't bother to post the recordings unless I get a 40+ drop though, cos I'll know I'm incorrect.
---
Cant you just move your camp if you don’t want to server hop?
---
Oh, I mean that's just the noteworthy stuff there was about 130 purified water and 400 40mm in my inventory at one point. I was like "wait, my CW is 411 why am I over encumbered?! Oh."
---
I purchased from Sutton also. It was before the latest patch though. 
---
I like your sign post :)
---
I picked up two X01 plan mods this morning from the SBQ.  Very cool 
---
Bump
---
My alt is stealth rifleman heavy agility I lose the SB and scorched pretty easily 
---
Oh you! ;)
---
"Bethesda, stop making me hit you", or "stop liking what I don't like"? Can't decide which...
---
Oh it definitely is ! If i knew at first how long that might take, i wouldn’t even had crafted the X-01, but after farming for 5-6 hours i was like “i’ve spent too much time on this shit there’s no way i m giving up now”
---
I think the reason they don't offer this is because it would be a strong, objective advantage for melee players.  We tend to have far more ammo than we know what to do with, and that would be a revenue stream that gunners wouldn't have.
---
You might be able to balance it through bulking, I guess.
---
I would tucking give you gold if I could I agree.
---
Dum dums would know what’s broken if they only they would play the game.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s only 1 person working on the code and that’s why the game is stalled 
---
To be fair heart of the enemy is well hidden and I happened on queen of the hunt but didn’t know what it was till I looked up the achievement later. Also only killed 3 people because you either have to find someone wanted or you’ll die trying to hit someone who didn’t hit you first.
---
Honestly the damage is done. Even with patches to fix all ten issues or a reboot the memory will remain. 
---
I've been with ESO since launch and see how the game improved, it still has the launch day reputation to many though. 
---
I honestly love this game so much. I've spent so much time in it and the devs did a great job in so many ways with it. There are definitely core issues that are ruining the experience, and have been for many, like crashes, disconnects, freezes, things that interrupt gameplay and destroy all work and progress in that session. Then there are issues and limitations with the loot system and cap farming. While people could be enjoying themselves playing with plenty of good items and caps, and enjoying the PvP and PvE stuff together, they are instead having at times a very unrewarding experience and their game is being interrupted with game breaking bugs. 
---
I still love this game and if I play it and don't have any issues it's awesome. I could play it for another 400+ hours I'm sure, just doing mundane things like building at workshops, defending against the mobs and players, etc. Most other games can't really compare to the time you can put into the game just wandering and collecting stuff and fighting mobs and a little pvp, but I'm at a position in the game where I have a lot of nice items and I think for a lot of people getting to that point is a very long and tiresome and unrewarding experience 95% of the time. That's why I go on about loot system and cap stashes and stuff like that. Because people should be able to get the stuff they want. They should be able to get off the treadmill and enjoy the actual game instead of endlessly running Whitesprings and SBQ for next to nothing, and fast travelling between 7 vendors every day fore 1400 caps.
---
No doubt. The way I see it, if I can get as much time enjoying something as it took me to earn the money to buy it than I've broken even. 
---
Since it took me like 45 minutes to earn the $35 I spent on this game than I am way way in the green. 
---
I thought that was their initial idea back then when they announced the new feature of letting us know when our camp couldn't be placed and let us choose to switch to another server where our camp can be placed...instead they went the cheap way....again
---
I claim open workshops and I have not had someone try to claim it from me in months.    
---
Thanks.  I’ll look !  In game I’m a bit of a nuka cola collector.  But not the pedestrian stuff. Just the flavors !! 
---
You should buy Skyrim VR!
---
Watoga train station always has T60 mods available.  The Generals Steakhouse has a shed in the back where I got some of my T60 gear.  
---
Let me just put this right here.
---
(Sets down brown bag: .38x1583 + 2000 Fusion cells.)
---
Anybody got any .50 or 5.56?
---
I don't know that I'll buy their products ever again if this is the future of their development efforts with rampant and egregious attempts at monetization.
---
All that is fair.
---
My point is that there is seemingly a large portion of the player base that is alleging they've squeezed all they can out of the game with 400-700 hours, but the numbers reflect that few have actually done that.
---
I agree with the over all sentiment of your comments. To my point, people feel entitled to get everything they want out of this game. Sure, Beth should and is working to make it better, but they literally don't have to. Unless of course some of these so called lawsuits become a reality. About the toxic comment; it was a feeling based on an amalgamation of the comments in the entire thread and sub. Your comment was just when I mentioned it but it does speak to your... let's call it, passion. You use such often misused words like "assume" and "literally" that it does make you sound toxic.
---
Interestingly enough, industrial purifiers have a rain collector on top of them.  Graphical only, but it's there!  It would be cool if they got their collection rate boosted during rains from this.  
---
It wouldn't really be a meaningful change, albeit an immersive one.  I don't think it could work, though, becaues camps are supposed to be capped at 1 food/water resource generated per cycle.  At least that's what I've heard.  I haven't tested it extensively, but it explains why multiple purifiers don't increase water generation per hour, but does reduce the frequency you need to empty them to maintain the maximum rate, because the generation gets spread across the storage capacity of the purifiers.
---
At level 150 hasn't seen that at once yet. Few times mothman. 
---
Oh yeah or if they don't play the objective their team mates have to shoot them after an office order. Or if they're Austrian soldiers and meet other Austrian soldiers they should fight. Mh as an Italian making this comment I'm slightly influenced by my nationality...
---
This happened to my friend. He started a new character and I power leveled him at whitesprings. He hit 25 on that character and the trophy popped. Its now the mule. I don't understand why it happens but I know you can get it that way. 
---
Yeah that was funny to use on raider camps 
---
How much did they pay you?  O, your already on the payroll.
---
Gotcha. Good troll though.
---
An Auto Handmade is a better a better heavy gun than an actual heavy gun.    Better perks, more available ammo.   Easier to fire.  
---
That is the lamest, most improperly used term to be thrown around in a long long time. 
---
Some notes about armor: it doesnt matter which body part  you craft and scrap. For example: I scrapped a bunch of arms and it unlocked ultralight for the torso. 
---
It gets confusing for the mods that can be attached to the limbs or torso (they are separate plans), because the notification doesnt always specify which bodypart it just unlocked, it might only say "ultralight unlocked".
---
In my experience, I usually unlock an armor mod 1/10 to 1/12 pieces I scrap (which seems less common than weapons).
---
This times a million
---
Lol at people who thinks it needs a reboot instead of tweaking fixing and updating
---
IMO, you can and should have both.  An enemy who is scary and difficult to kill who also drops worthwhile loot.  To me, a Scorchbeast should *always* drop something Legendary.
---
I like your moxie. From Vault-dweller, to Vault-seller. Mitigating the effects of the previously unforeseen event of *ahem*...total atomic annihilation. 
---
People use it to fast travel the map for free? I always accept team invites
---
If they actually wanted to fix this shit show AND the major bugs were gone?
---
Yeah, wipe that shit and give me a good game. 100% all in.
---
It is!
---
Wow a launch-ESO player, it's actually good to get your perspective ha
---
Ya got me pinned. Im a bethesda agent and have 37 mule accounts with tons of duped  wester revolver ivory grip and chemistry workbench plans. Lol.  Oh and 500k rounds of .38. 
---
Supposedly next patch will fix it so SBQ doesn't drop plans you already know. 
---
Um, that was pretty awesome!
---
I always wondered?
---
Dirty gets turned to boiled at 2:1, so I can see why it could be 2 boiled for every purified converted, but it doesn't make much sense because boiling would remove some of the water.  And I think boiled weighs more than purified for some reason.
---
That’s a valid point. Primarily the ability to scrap and repurposed ammo into different calibers would be very useful 
---
&gt;I wouldnt mind my 70 levels reseted at all at this point
---
Shut your dirty mouth.
---
Very good point. Also all the explosive weapons are severely underpowered. Why carry heavy mini nuke and missiles when a shotgun with perks do a better job. The weapon system is the most broken part in this game. When fighting the big boss like SBQ you should see players launching mini nukes instead of trying to stab her to death. It’s just pure comical. 
---
He's been hoarding apostrophes and needs to drop some weight.
---
I'm not saying I completely disagree with you, I have to point out that nobody bought a $200 game. They bought a $60 (80 if you count the Tricentenial content) game with a $120 helmet 
---
Wow.
---
You still believe in the Easter bunny too, don’t cha kid?
---
The washed bridge on the ash heap side of Charleston. Two lvl 14 spawn there.
---
Forget that. I want a gun rack on my power armor! 
---
Two pieces of my Power Armour with mods (by me) disappeared from my inventory and then reappeared a week (real time) later.  It's a mad, mad, mad world in Fallout 76 . . .
---
Were you past lvl 25 during the beta? If so, that's probably why. A lot of the level trophies did not come over from the beta to the retail version. Only one that popped for me was lvl 100, a couple of weeks ago when I actually reached that level. Even though, now that I think of it. Lvl 25 &amp; 50 didn't pop for me either when I reached them post beta. My son's character ended up popping them. It's wonky I guess.
---
*takes off pants*
---
You asked us to bare with you. What next?
---
This please!
---
Or have a rotating circular bed with red / black satin sheets!
---
You are definitely a child of 2019. God forbid someone disagree with you. They have to be radicals. Nope there is no middle ground is there? 
---
Did you try turning it off and on again?
---
this is a gripe - who cares?
---
I have a better solution, rad suit and any lake/river and spam collect.
---
That is pretty neat. Love junk extractor locations. I recently gave up on them though and moved into an old Cabin with a super mutant problem, makes things very interesting each time I quick travel home and gives me something to burn supplies on. Currently setting up death traps and rocket launchers in there to see if I can deal with them without wasting a ton of ammo.
---
I think what you say is sometimes true *before* they are aware of you.  I believe they actually know where you are and will tend to gravitate over to where you are and go "A-HA!  I found you!"  But that also presumes you're standing out in the open.  If you're in Chameleon and staying quiet, they will eventually fly off.
---
Likewise, if you run, they'll give chase for a bit, but they do stop at some point.  The biggest complicating factor to losing them, IMO, are the Scorched.  I believe when they see you, they "report" that information back to the Scorchbeast and the chase is on again.
---
Doesn't the tricent edition give you that?
---
Ha ha ha 
---
This!  Drives me nuts that “better” water can’t be substituted in the recipe. 
---
Does my Tato juice need to have a few rads in it to give it that extra kick? 
---
i usually run 3 - 4 workshops at a time.  maybe 5 or 6 times i have had a higher level come in and take and / or kill me.  that is in about 300hrs of play time.  hell, a few have even offered a ransom to me.  i just server hop at that point.  mostly, my WS are left alone.
---
when i am NOT doing workshops, i always invite strangers.  i play a high charisma character and can offer some very excellent bonuses.  so before you go "poo pooing" random invites, not all of us are out here to take advantage of others.
---
Fuck, just give us a vendor bot tied to a separate stash with the ability to put caps pricing in.
---
He’s there at our camp while we play and bingo, we have player trading well done. Golf clap.
---
This thread right now.
---
Stream!
---
See edit!
---
for my first 30 or so levels I had my camp set up between Deathclaw Island and Tyler County Fairgrounds and every time I logged in I was "attacked" or I spawned underwater . where's your C.A.M.P.?
---
It's been like that all since Fallout 4. Probably won't change. 
---
&gt;they have gotten progressively more coy about whats coming down the pipeline
---
That's because the only guy working on FO76 keeps taking random sick days.
---
 The Metro games are COD warmed over. How do I know? I have the first two.
---

---
This is honestly the best point I've seen on this topic. 
---
yes they are   here is the llist
---
Sounds like a good way to kill the game.
---
I’ve given mine names. They’re like cats that go away and then come back on a regular basis. 
---
 No halfwit, that's the Russians. Try to get it right,.
---
Ban this guy!!
---
to my understanding, each event even next to a certain item can drop ANY of these items in the region?
---
Scorchbeast neighbors come by regularly for tea.  Great neighborhood.
---
They always have at least 1 of every flavour for sale, including Quantum.
---
enable all past power armor paint jobs for Excavator and Ultracite power armor
---
Use a pick axe or a machete for a few plays and you’ll save up lots of ammo, I alternate game play 
---
It's not unusual. I racked up a ton of leather with my lower level toon, and wanted to unlock stabilized for leather arms. I crafted 400+ leather arms and scrapped them all before unlocking stabilized and studded right at the end. 
---
it is unreal how many posts where made in this thread that had nothing to do with what the OP was asking.  FINALLY......cherrybombTM comes to the rescue!!  woo HOO!!
---
Cry baby
---
This is awesome, really cool artwork! Hope you'll post an update after  you get the tattoo!
---
I ran into this as well.  I had to restart the game to make it stop (it's possible that just logging out and logging in would fix it too).
---
I was afflicted with "Light Radiation (&lt;1 M)" in the Effects tab and getting hit by +3 Rads constantly.  After a minute, it would stop, and then start again for another minute.  RadAway and Disease Cures made no difference.
---
I believe it's caused by the Scorchbeasts, possibly their cropdusting attack, or something around Fissure Site Prime.
---
there are TONs of stuff I'd love added. I look around at all the lab consoles and medical equipment and wish I could use those assets for my base. I'd drop some Atom money for those.
---
I had 5 achievements I needed to start an alt for because some of the stuff didn't register due to being on the beta
---
yes exactly all of them can drop any of that stuff 
---
The amount of nice people hear is heart warming 😌 but to all that asked I’m on Xbox (Immortal DayJo) and you don’t have to go out of your way to do any of this stuff. (unless you want to. I’m not gonna stop free stuff 😂) I was just stating that I don’t see any people like this around.
---
Sounds like you have a bad camp location if scorch beasts are repeatedly spawning.
---
As for your spawn location in your camp being inside it, try moving your CAMP device around a bit inside the camp (not relocating) this can trigger a new spawn location for your camp when you log in or fast travel.  
---
awesome!  thanx!
---
Ehh it's free loot. Only time I want revenge on someone taking my loot bag was when a friend of mine got downed in a nuke zone at white springs and 3 people stood by her not helping waiting for her to die and then took her loot bag. Needless to say being a demo player I nukes the crap out of their base took their loot bags plus they were locked I thirty base sorting their legendary items in bags too, friend swiped those and we just kept killing and wrecking their base until the left. 
---
Now if I'm in a nuke zone get my self killed and no one noticed I'm downed or mob AOE gets me, oh well lost loot. Just don't watch me die and take my shit then I'll kill you.
---
When i have too much ammo, i just pick up the first weapon i find that use them and i start wasting. But this doesn't work, cause my .44 and .45 are 2400+, and they're keep growing...
---
Then you complain so he pisses all over it.
---
I think a mole miner suit working like a ghillie suit would be fantastic. 
---
I like the weapon and armor racks, but I also want something to display collectible items. Probably the biggest thing missing for me from previous games.
---
&gt; Not sure how trading in multiple Technical data is considered an exploit, unless it was actually causing instability. 
---
It's why I put "exploiting" in quotes. It's not a literal exploit but a way to get a lot of rewards/xp at once, which seems not to be the intent of Bethesda.
---
I distinctly remember reading somewhere that this quest was nerfed around the time they were clamping down on XP gains and quest rewards to make the game more grindy. The quest change had to do with that. 
---
As I mentioned, the change isn't a bug, it's a feature. Feel free to verify independently but I assure you how things work with Forbidden Knowledge is intended.
---
thank you so much!
---
In all seriousness. It might be a leveling exploit when you use a ton of it in recipes. 
---
Be interesting to see if making drinks this way levels you way faster than normal. 
---
Interplay
---
I feel playing with you would be a fun experience. Many of your in-game quips make me laugh when you respond to people.
---
That's both misogynistic and incorrect.  Not speaking meaningfully and regularly is what is making people more angry here.
---
That'd be pretty cool. They could make it like turning into a set of weakened power armor with high rad defense or something for balance. I get the feeling just from the normal mutations and diseases that a part of this games theme is losing your humanity after it'd be cultivated and protected so long in the vault... second you step out your alone and things went all Battle Royale with everything trying to kill you - especially the other vault dwellers you were cooped up with for 25 years long. It'd be interesting if at the very least the mutations had a visual element to them... though I guess in F03 everyone was kind of a mutant in some respects and they didnt look anything other than just dirty. 
---
And dont wanna be a super mutant anymore? Pop some vim! Or.. do some sort of long side quest to purge it. I think both of those were in F04.
---
Better "stealthy" outfits for male characters?
---
but he loves me.
---
Lower the prices permanently
---
np bud and good luck
---
to you as well!
---
&gt; It's not even comparable. I wish Bethesda gave a fuck like ~~EA~~ **Respawn**. I can't believe I just wrote that. 
---
Fixed that for you.  EA wasn't even for sure they wanted to make the game and Respawn basically said trust us and for some unknown reason they actually did.  EA just wants money and that is all that has driven them for over a decade.
---
A youtuber tried to over react to glitches in the game to get viewers?? He must’ve been the first guy on YouTube to do that, everyone please go like and subscribe 
---
7 of the 8 come from related mags. the last one is nuka tapper. came from vault 76, your starting terminal
---
Don't you get that from either the enclave or bos quests? 
---
Already has that.  Scorchbeast attacks on homes occur on the regular.
---
Wrong sub
---
The games fine, if you like the fallout universe you’ll have fun in the game 
---
The point should be, it’s easily the best grind to do for items.
---
You always get good stuff, coupled with a decent chance for great stuff.
---
I do multiples every session.  No reason not to.
---
You’re going to find this sub full of those that live the game and hate the game. I’m a huge fan, and it been a lot of fun. I’m probably 100+ hours in, and enjoying it immensely. A few of the fixes have been big(closing some bad exploits) others have been ‘duh!’ Moments (adding ‘known’ to plans you’ve already learned) and still others have had almost no noticeable affect.  It’s probably best to play for a bit and see if you like. 
---
I like getting my money's worth for games, so if a game doesn't have some good replay value I tend to avoid it. There are plenty of games that can easily give you as many, if not more hours, of enjoyment.  I mean, break down what you were doing those 500 hours, I've done pretty much everything in this game myself, minus a few quests that I've been having server issues with, but I won't get into that.  
---
Off the top of my head, games that easily give hundreds of hours of enjoyment - either through additional side quests, just exploring, or even grinding out so you can complete end game content:
---
* **Minecraft** \- since I put down FO76 until they fix the issues where I disconnect every 20 minutes, I have picked up Minecraft again (Java version, don't have bedrock) and I can spend hours building my "camp", exploring deep caves, hunting down enemies at night, working towards getting perfect enchanted diamond gear, and playing around with redstone to create contraptions. 
---
* **Witcher 3** \- I haven't even scratched the surface of this game, which outdoes skyrim (skyrim only wins in my eyes because I have more control over who I am)
---
* **Disgaea series (any of them)** \- one of the best tactical RPGs out there, with many options on how you want to tackle the game, with the ultimate goal of grinding out characters to level 9999, to reincarnate them to do it again, much of what you focus on is finding ways to be as efficient with that grind as possible, all to take on the ultimate demon lord. 
---
* **Pokemon** \- sure, I'm 40 years old and still play Pokemon.  Even just taking a single game, while the story may be very basic and childish, reaching highest level with your team, breeding to find the perfect stats, even earning ribbons and taking on the various (end game endless battle) can be enjoyable.  I ignore the cutesy and just focus on the stats and the battle aspect of it, even playing single player I can find reason to want to create spreadsheets of the game. 
---
* **Monster Hunter World** \- with new content coming out constantly, tons of quests, and a very stable experience, along with different weapons to find and grind out the materials for, I would say that Monster Hunter World will provide more than enough challenge and enjoyment. 
---
* **Borderlands 2** \- I speak to this one specifically because Handsome Jack is THE best villain I have ever had to face against in a game, with a good engaging story for the main campaign, fun DLC (especially the Dungeons and Dragons style one) and Ultimate Vault Hunter mode you have reaons to go back and keep grinding through the game.
---
* **Dying Light -** Over a year after the game was released, they recently had a year of free content added to the game in preperation for their new game, this game has lots of different options and game modes to try to max out your character, the Parkor system in the game is fantastic, and has some fun challenges that can test your skills. 
---
That's just the tip of the iceberg, I'm not even counting games like Diablo 2 or 3 (especially 3 on consoles), the Wasteland games, Final Fantasy games, etc. 
---
**TL;DR:** 500+ hours for a game is nothing special, there are plenty of games out there that offer that (and more) and don't need us to try to Febreze the piece of shit that Fallout 76 turned out to be.  
---
I've done a lot of research on it.  90% of the posts say this:
---
Protective and Shielded Raider drops from Uranium Fever.  
---
That's where I got Protective from.  I ended up getting sick of farming for it and traded for Shielded Raider.  It seems like it's 1 in 100 drop or worse.
---
If you're looking for trades for it, go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  Please note it's crazy rare and people are going to want an arm, a leg, and one of your lungs for it.....lol
---
It doesnt equip two, theres a D pad button that can let you cycle back to the last used weapon. So equip one, go back to pip boy, equip a different one, then you should be able to hit a directional and go back to the first 
---
I understand that this game does deserve some criticism,  that said you can't ignore the fact that the bathesda team is making serious efforts to improve game quality and server stability. Just read the patc notes, each update has hundreds of bug fixes. They listen to the complaints of the fo76 community and then fix it. And that is a fact, I just feel like no ones noticing that.. people just complain over stupid shit. Example "I kill a 3 star legendary and get garbage drops" well yea they can't drop a 3 star epic legendary every time.. otherwise the 3*'s wouldn't be rare and special. 
---
Here here... although I don't mind a little inventory management to be honest. It's almost a game in itself figuring out what lowers in weight when you bulk it, how much of something you need and what you can toss. 
---
I put my camp near a river or lake.
---
Don't forget the golf balls in the gym - 2 locations - one where people were playing beer pong and the other off to the side near the bleachers.  Also there's bowling pins along one of the walls and another up on top of the "kitchen" you can get to from hopping there from the bleachers.
---
I hate mixed fealings about this... on the one hand.. that would be fair... on the other I have fun grabbing all the bags of people who die in Nuke Zones! :D
---
Unless you get the broken one where it’s five feet away and you have detached skinny arms that look like a ghoul and you can’t read the pipboy.
---
Good call though. I don’t even know why the other is default.  Pipboy is immersive. 
---
Harping on that poor ferry....
---
Cars immobile, roads impassible! Walk Score: 100
---
the FEV tanks are nullified, you will not become a super mutant. you WILL however take a lot of rads, and possibly mutate one of the game's natural mutations
---
You and just about everyone else.  
---
Nice - yeah a fancy looking modern (non rusted out) chem station with a microscope.
---
Is there a ritual for summoning mods?
---
Haha, I played Bethesda's first game, "Gridiron!", on a Commodore. You are definately a child of 2019, being butthurt when you don't get instant gratification, or a gaming studio doesn't cater to you specifically.
---
I agree. That's a necessity.
---
Never seen a double/quad fat man, missile launcher, m79, or auto grenade launcher.
---
Never seen a railway rifle with double/quad either, or two shot, or explosive. 
---
I also assume crossbow can’t be explosive but someone correct me if I’m wrong. 
---
I play Hunter vs Hunted sometimes and I have a lot of fun
---
And click bell icon so you will get notified right away whenever I post my totally original content.
---
Look at you. I deal with this every night multiple times.  Have since forever.
---
Happens if you open up pipboy before the game takes its 5minutes to render everyth8ng on server, cause that’s how we program in 1984.
---
Interesting theory. Although being high level in this game only makes u a sweet target for lower levels. I dont pvp in my level 200 character. I pvp in my level 50. Makes higher level player angry lol
---
* Paints should apply to everything that accepts paints.
---
* Greenhouse construction kit, like the rooftops in Lewisburg, along with dirt foundation pieces that accept plants and Water Purifiers.
---
* More underarmor options.
---
I don't know why they have such funky names for the components, but there are only about 30 components so the problem with sorting is not too great.  In Fallout 4, you can't scrap junk into components, and you can't see the amount of each component except in workshop mode, so for me that was a bigger problem.  Of course, FO4 also lets you put junk items in your settlements, so it's a very different game.
---
And specialized ammo types!
---
Yea sorry i saw it after posting, still radsuit up!
---
This is ultimately the issue.. even if you knew who did it, that person may not be flagged.
---
What would it cost though? They are complete garbage currently, and the game is already imbalanced as hell. That's what I think most people aren't factoring in. If we were playing a well-balanced game with tight security and semi-functional laser/plasma weapons in need of a slight tweak, then you're right on the money. Currently, they are simply worthless. Anything is better than nothing.
---
So I guess no is noticing the hundreds of bug fixes in the last 2 patches. But yea I'm sorry "they don't care about making the game better " lol what a joke
---
Thanks for the report and the video, I'll make sure we have this documented for investigation.
---
You right, you right. I'm hoping that years from now in Fallout 5 Bethesda will have figured out what works with what, and bring back the nitty gritty grim world that they captured in Fallout 3. Would be amazing if they could pull Black Isle amounts of dark tho.
---
The biggest issue is that if you want .38 it's more efficient to go to the prison and kill all the low level super mutants and gain caps and scrap than it is to track someone down and buy it
---
It's almost like they didn't read the post...
---
The flies are normal if you are very close to the meat pile.  You're just lucky there actually was a meat pile.  Since "Day 1" back in November, I've encountered disappearing corpses (and loot) in a number of areas.  The very worst one was the Airplane Crash Site/High-tension Electric Tower near Morgantown inhabited by Super Mutants.  Twice, I've sneaked close, taken out all the Muties . . . only to find not a single corpse/meat pile/loot when I closed in to collect the spoils.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
The amount of items increased even with max weight  reduction isn't close to what player carry exploiting the carry weight system. 
---
No?
---
He actually clearly and efficently goes over each of the glitches in the video and describes how they were triggered/what happened in them.
---
I'm not sure if you're just trolling or actually such a cultist that any critical or analytical thought gets automatically dismissed in your mind.
---
Fountain in Whitespring heals your diseases btw
---
Yeah I see that I myself am working on the 100% but all that remains are the 5 achievements I missed out on because of beta. I think most people just view getting a good load out as their limit.
---
Interesting.  I've been hating the slowness of the water pump so much that I've started relying only on dirty/boiled water that  I find as loot, and just use Purified or Cola the rest of the time.
---
...though my Cola supply has been unreliable since I turned into a crazed grenadier.
---
I did have one idea to just build a whole bunch of water pumps in a row, but I guess that seemed like a lot of work or something?  I've never gotten around to doing it.  I'm lame.
---
A good smg build isnt too bad fwiw. 
---
How does boiling remove radioactive dust? You don't need to boil rainwater in real life or in the game.
---
Yes. I think there are a few other things that are static as well. But I *know* the plans are. 
---
What throws me off is the damn way they’ve tied jumping ability and running speed to the amount of space you have.
---
I regen quickly, so a tap now and I jump 10 feet, 2seconds later same tap 3 feet. I mean wtf?!
---
This is why it sucks ass so bad.  You can’t react to ever changing base skill speed/jump length.
---
I would gladly take both those off your hand, I'm a pistol build
---
It is a fun game. Very enjoyable. It has some issues but not enough to make it u enjoyable. Take your time, don’t buy off eBay, and you will have fun
---
Reminds me of when I’m running and I get stuck on a pebble or twig. Damn near nothing in front of me but I can’t run and have to jump over the tiny thing lol
---
1 lead 1 brass 1 gunpowder. 
---
Shhhhh. They'll nerf it if we talk about it
---
In a world where the favorite soft drink was slightly radioactive soda?  Yes.  Yes, it does.
---
Did you even try to watch this?
---
yup.
---
I would take a backpack if it increased my carry weight 100 pounds 
---
What annoys me the most.... theyre commenting on people's CAMP designs. Nothing on anything actually relevant.
---
I just don't get it. Not like it should effect server stability and if anything the limit should have been (started at) 76 at least....
---
new staircase options
---
The larger more robust the program, the longer it takes to fix.   Ask anyone who works in internet marketing how many year long issuses they have with paid advertising products from Bing and/or Google.   You know, the biggest tech guys on the block.   
---
So if the worlds most profitable tech companies take sometimes years to fix product breaking issues, why do we hold an entertainment company to a higher standard than infrastructure.     
---
Let the devs do what they do, and stop bitching that your instant gratification isnt fast enough for your redbulled up appetite. 
---
FUCK NO, I hate the pvp in this game, had an encounter last night, that reminded me why I play with pacifist on. Fuck the pvp in this game, melee is OP and my rifle build sucks now cuz they decided to make TSE's about useless. Even before the TS-E nerf there was a few times that I would shot a player and they would run at me and kill me with a super sledge in one hit, while I was in PA. Only other thing I can think of is that my build is fucked up or I'm missing or don't know about a perk, I played BETA and haven't started a new character yet to go with melee.
---
IMO the game is not intended for team deathmatch or capture the flag. Team deathmatch is already there in a way, team up and go fight other teams. Instead of CTF, hold a workshop long enough and some one will come and try to claim it, so it's more like holding an objective. 
---
No bs but I've crashed the server twice just crafting boiled water.
---
Interesting idea! I'll get this documented, thanks for the feedback.
---
I dont understand how asking for a game that isn't broken and isnt being broken even worse after every patch, or asking for a studio who doesnt go radio silent for weeks, or even asking for a studio who actually acknowledges all of the issues and reads feedback bad? How is this instant gratification? How is holding a company accountable for their actions being butthurt? Dude what world are you in where any of this is ok? I'm done arguing with you because you obviously can't argue back. Some people just are so deadset on their ways that it positively stuns me. If you played bethesda's first game you know very well that they are capable of much more than what they are doing with this game. This game is a disgrace compared to their previous titles.
---
D'oh!
---
Yep pretty much this.  You had things they didn't.  Your tactics were better than theirs and they had no recourse but to get salty and toss accusations.
---
Welcome to pvp in any game online.
---
He’s gone downhill. 
---
I'm pretty sure how you are playing it, is how they intended it to be played. :) 
---
I did like it a lot, even if I didn't like some of it's issues with balance and scaling.
---
...Then I couldn't play it because of the lag, the glitches, the crashes, and the bugs.  So yeah, I'm a bit salty.
---
Srsly? Dang!
---
I'm noticing the patches. That's why I'm saying that we need enthusiasm from the team to keep us going while they do the important job of patching and creating content. This isn't about what they have done or will do, but about meeting the enthusiasm of the community. 
---
For real, I am rich in stims, water, and 40mm rounds.
---
Fisto's gotta eat somehow.. 
---
It is likely just user error. I got hit by this "bug" 3 times and then got the "don't drop/sell your equiped and fav items" mod and haven't lost an item since.
---
PS4? I give you all for some black titanium, i've started a PA collection
---
I tried this first, a row of pumps, but you can't hit the next until the first one finishes so it's exactly the same speed.  Drinking and spamming collect during the drink animation is by far the fastest way I've found to get dirty water (from a pump in a camp that doesn't have access to open water already since I need to say this 100 tines lol)
---
Not if you built a mansion like me
---
another one of these? have many times has someone posted their build at this location? its a terrible location now nearly half the time u log into a server its taken.  the more people advertise a good location the harder it is to find empty.
---
I just got to make my pop boy pink so... bugger off.
---
Then there shouldn't be a delay in increasing stash size for players.  
---
Beat me to it, thanks.
---
How so?
---
im getting anthem this weekend and i believe that is gonna be a huge time sink..i hope i like the gameplay and not just play it for one day and then never play it again..it looks really good and the feedback response have been somewhat positive thus far
---
More wasteland themed clothing.
---
It's better than it was at launch, new update with possible added content coming next month at the latest, road map coming at the end of this month
---
Excellent application of probability!   Good mathing.         
---
I have a 1/346,410  chance of getting a specific drop...assuming the legendary actually drops a legendary item...
---
Yup. Thanks to Bethesda's QUALITY CODING energy weapons dont benefit from armor reduction because it only touches **normal resist**. Problem was in 4 and remains in 76 to this day. Another fuckup is that demo expert only boosted the explosive damage of grenades and the like. So Pulse Grenades and the Energy part of Plasma grenades get jackshit.
---
You can tell they dont even play their own games at all.
---
I wouldn't say it's changed that much since launch, for most players.  Most of their changes had the effect of slowing down the game's progression and are imperceptible to new players.  Outside of server disconnects and latency, you don't encounter too many massive bugs, although some Events are just intolerably broken.
---
If you go in expecting a game heavy on exploration and the loot-and-shoot gameplay loop of Fallout 4, you'll like it.  If you ever wanted a Fallout where you could just "live" in the world and be self-directed, this is that game.  On the other hand, if you want to argue philosophy with NPCs and make big moral decisions about the fate of the wasteland, it's not.
---
Yanno, this is why I wish Bethesda put in a creative mode like No Man's Sky.
---
Then we could build bases to the top of the Top of the World and all sorts of ludicrous shit. 
---
&gt; idiots get called idiots.
---
Fair enough, I guess it's only fitting then....
---
You're an asshole.
---
Thanks for this! I'll get this reported internally so we can take a look.
---
Similar to the combat rifle? I can dig it
---
It’s the second worst game design flaw in fallout.  Touchy would be an understatement.
---
The only people not rage quitting over it are either duper’s (have max caps), idiots, masochists, can bois, or are completely delusional/ jaded.
---
Thanks for the feedback on the Vault-Tec headlamp, I'll bring it up for discussion.
---
Me lol howd you find me
---
Don't forget all of the joy you have undoubtedly shed upon this sub.
---
Could be accomplished by a seek revenge prompt. Entering both parties into pvp full damage. 
---
Well, I like my spot
---
I've replaced my ps4 pro's 1tb hard drive with a 1tb solid state hd and I literally have 7 second load times on any map I'm on.
---
Thank you!!!
---
Oh my real estate is much better than those silly vaults! Why live underground when you can live in a tower.
---
&gt; I don't recall ever putting a game down after 20 hours and saying, wow, that was amazing.
---
This was Prey (2017) for me. Played it through twice in a row, steam says ~21 hours, and had nothing but the highest praises for the game. I'd include Celeste and the Resident Evil 2 Remake (excluding Mr. X) as other recent examples.
---
Dollar value is a great metric, but I've played plenty of games where despite having 100+ hours, I leave feeling irritated. Vermintide 2 is the recent example I'd personally use, but FO76 fits as well. I can't speak for anyone else, but I don't like my lasting impression being a largely *negative* one. 
---
So yes, some games have may less gametime, but those games can also feel incredibly satisfying and refreshing comparatively. Games can instead be stable, largely bug-free, have minimal grind/filler, and have a *cohesive design philosophy* throughout. I'd liken it to certain shows that purposefully end after a single season; they told the story they wanted without overstaying their welcome.
---
Of course, if someone can't afford many games, then fair enough. 20 hours @ $60 is still better than a large number of hobbies/pastimes. Theater movies are what now, $15?
---
I think you're trying to impose too much "reality" on the arms/ammunition issue.  I'd just be happy if the same weapon with the same ammunition and in the same condition would have the same damage effect on similar targets from one server session to the next.
---
I like it - especially the roof deck with defenses.  But just 1 water purifier?  I have 2 industrial ones and used to have 3 even.
---
If you are on PC grab the mod that keeps you from selling/droping your equiped and favorited items.
---
Theres a vender bot at camden park thar sells all of the excavator powerarmer plans
---
See edit :3
---
I think this method can be improved. Let me put on my EVIL hat for a second.
---
1. Capture a workshop.  
---
2. Station a friend (let's call him Alan) at that workshop who is NOT in a team with you.  
---
3. Find a juicy high level player (let's call him Bobby) and team up with them.  
---
4. Transfer workshop ownership and leave team.  
---
5. Team up with Alan who is at the workshop.  
---
6. Alan contests the workshop. **You are now both PvP flagged against Bobby.**  
---
7. Kill Bobby, collect caps, rinse, repeat.
---
Does that sound like it could work?
---
Not new, but worth repeating!
---
Three quick notes/adds:
---
* Drinking any decent quantity of pump water will likely leave you with a disease. Watch your drug/food effects (many of them make you more susceptible to disease and some improve your resistance).
---
* Collecting any dirty water incurs rads. Hazmat suits are the win for this. I think the easiest one for new players would be on the roof of the  Poseidon Energy Plant. You don't need to enter the plant; climb the catwalks to the roof and find it in the office/trailer. For veterans, they're pretty common in any of the "nuclear" locations (disposal sites, WestTek, etc.). 
---
* Converting dirty to boiled water still consumes wood. It's not the hardest thing to find, but you'll burn (pun noted) through it quickly. Making, say, 10 corn soup from scratch uses 20 wood (and 20 dirty water): 10 to boil the water, 10 to make the soup. The "Wood Chucker" perk may get sneered at, but it makes collecting wood *so much* more effective. Equip it when you need it, hit the woods and go to town!
---
Happy camping!
---
A Slocum's Joe fryer that we can make donuts with, it could even just be regular food and ingredients. In fact I like that more, it's funny to imagine someone putting in random stuff and grabbing out donuts
---
But what's the benefit? Can't sell them, they last 30 mins each anyway so you can't use that many, and their benefits are so specific 50% of them are irrelevant
---
You sir are a Prince among men ! This is awesome !
---
It's too little too late. There shouldn't be hundreds of bugs to fix in the base game four months in.
---
Not scorchbeast.  That’s man bat and they stole it from dc...without his pants.
---
Yeah some more mutations would be cool :)
---
That's funny, I just checked mine. I don't have the trophy for Ground Zero "Be at ground zero of a Nuclear Blast" and it gave me a silver. Hmmm you're either there or you're not. Is that like dead or not dead. Either way, I've been nuked a few times.
---
Silly
---
RC
---
I think stash space should be 10,000 it would be a limited amount but me beimg a level 25 im having storage issues 
---
I've wanted to get into one of them pelowski(I think that's what they are called) nuclear bomb shelters and see if I would survive.
---
I think you're the millionth person to suggest this. Not sure if you get a prize for that though.
---
It's insane dedication, I wish I could help out but don't have the time sadly
---
Can you underline it a couple of times, just so they know? Thanks.
---
Which MMO has PVP, crafting, building, 25+ players, open world, and massive inventories...and works well?
---
You think all their engines are bad so it makes you seem incompetent for buying it. I think you bought it for the outrage this is your favourite feeling.
---
You probably bought Destiny 2 and No Man's Sky for the outrage too.
---
New items connected with factions. Faction CAMP items. New faction armor skins, not just paint jobs but completely new alternative versions. New faction clothing items. People like things that are new. People like things that look awesome. People will grind away for a while to get things like that if there is less RNG and more progression towards like in WoW you could buy armor with tokens from Arena and Dungeons, along with some items that are more lowish percent chance to drop from certain bosses. Or even like the Technical Data thing. What would make people excited? What would bring people back? A new boss that drops something they really want? Maybe it's only a 1-5% chance? Maybe the other 95-99% of the time something at least with some value or use drops that can be traded for something of similar value or use. Like I just keep thinking something big. Something spectacular. Wow people. Be consistent. Keep up the pace of releasing new things. Get creative. Get innovative. Get crazy. Things people think "That would be cool" but the game developers never do it. Do it. Do the cool things. People want to be Super Mutants. They want to be Robots. They want to be Ghouls. Etc. Why not do it? Anything can be shoehorned in. Anything can work. Game developers have a great opportunity to do a lot of cool things. The biggest and best and most profitable games actually do it. They do the "You know what would be cool". Somebody says "Yeah that would be cool. Lets do it.". Opportunities and potential is being lost with this game so far. Hopefully someone can realize its potential and make it right.
---
Light a candle (optional) and then click "report"
---
So what would be the best bet of getting the fireman outfit? I kmow chances are minimal but . 
---
O, and look at your bot army downvoting me to hide the truth.
---
Yeah, I wish they'd do normal naming conventions on junk......lol
---
I've had multiple times where I'm crafting things for someone and say "I need cloth".  Then we both need to dive into the junk tab to find that "cloth" is named "raw cloth"......lol
---
Bethesda employee detected.  Bethesda downvote bots rolling out.
---
I wanna know the same for the western outfits, my guess is the events next to the item have a higher chance
---
Fallout Network has channels for every platform iirc
---
Yeah heard it was but not too sure
---
Housing walls and such that aren't already broken when I build them.
---
boo!  -1
---
About a week after never by my math.
---
Ty for admitting it.  That’s a start.
---
Wait they'd never..............OMFG what happened to White Knight!
---
I stand corrected :(
---
I am lvl 241 but never bothered with dailies. Are the the like different every day or can i always go to same place for it?
---
Why the fuck should I have to pay for them in the first place 
---
If you clicked on the video and looked at the length, you'd see that Joseph Anderson quite literally means 1001 glitches. He explains each and every one of them as well.
---
Leaving aside the glaring problems with FEV being in Virginia at this time in the series, I think it would be a lot of fun to have the option of choosing a race or faction.  This could also have a  bering on pvp.
---
I personally really enjoyed Tactics, and this was something you could do in that game.
---
they are bugged atm, you can possibly get certain ones once a day, or once a week, or even never
---
It would be 100% improved with flatulent sound effects.  That anyone in the area can hear.
---
THANK YOU for mentioning that! WTF is with the posts today whining about Bethesda not giving enough feedback? Unless we have web cams in all their cubicles it's like reddit won't stop being toxic dicks.
---
Why am i not surpriced 😂 so i should visit potential daily places? 
---
Pre-nerf, that perk was a godsend. It's still pretty good, but man 90% extra durability...you could feel it. 
---
Yea seems pretty sad that we get some weird shit rather then some lore clothing that makes the game feel more like a post apocalyptic game rather then fortnite 
---
Camo paints for all armor types (e.g., marine).   Basic colors (especially pink!) for all power armors.   Simple reskins of guns to make them look like other guns—a 10mm becomes similar to a Colt Model 1911, a Handmade looks more like an AR instead of an AK.    
---
found the green thumb
---
yeah this is unfortunate..u cant just fast travel out of there because you are in the nuke zone..whitespring in general is dangerous..when i log out while im there i know to always equip my hazmat suit just in case its a nuke zone nnext time i log in. I made a post recently about player-etiquette in regards to loot bags..i myself always leave it if theres other players in the area..if its still there 15 mins later i consider it free game..but for someone to just instanly swoop down like a vulture..that is completely uncalled for
---
it's worth a shot, if its next to an item it likely has higher chances of dropping, also if you do big game hunt, fix the terminal read the stuff then talk to the huntsman, not guaranteed to work but i got it once yesterday
---
Thank you! Yeah, I'm still thinking what to put on the deck behind the defense (kinda wish we had sandbags as well), as there's an 1 empty square there. Regarding purifiers - I get by with one, as I do lots of events and get water from those - rarely I carry less than 30 at a time.
---
You and a date go to the movies you just paid the same for a 2 hour entertainment.
---
Eh, it might be a wait and see for now.
---
They seem to be laser focused 100% on fixing every single bug in the game, and completely forgetting about adding content.
---
So you can get X hours of play time now, but after that you'll start to get bored.
---
Ok , got to get testing. Thank u very much 
---
SGA: If you need acid, here's a nice little farming route.
---
* Begin your circuit at Hemlock Holes. Head into the golf course and find the Grafton Monster. Kill it for ~6 acid, then go to the crashed Vertibird and kill the two Snallygasters that often spawn there for another ~6 acid each. Now head to the workshop and just collect acid right from the nodes, don't bother taking the workshop.  
---
* Next, fast travel to the dried lakebed and check surroundings. There will often be a Grafton Monster and a handful of Snallygasters if you're lucky.  
---
* Now travel to Charleston Station and head south to the canal right outside Poseidon power plant. There's a guaranteed Grafton Monster spawn.  
---
* Finally, walk into Charleston and head for the dam. There will often be a Snallygaster and there's a guaranteed Grafton Monster spawn.  
---
This run nets somewhere between 60 and 100 acid or more if you're lucky. Combined with my usual iron ore/lead ore run, I am now the proud owner of literal assloads of 5mm ammo.
---
Thank you! I was kinda inspired by Skyrim's Honeyside - my fav home there.
---
no problem, good luck
---
Funny given that Warframe is above 25GB these days on PCs iirc and they can get a hotfix out in mere hours or less after a big update. Meanwhile Bethesda's dragging their damn feet on even critical bugs.
---
Animals that rest on your shoulder. Like parrots, kittens, baby mole rats. 
---
What, you don't like all the hello kitty my little pony items?
---
I'm waiting for better military looking power armor skins and over-armor skins.
---
Until then, those atoms are staying in my wallet.
---
Thanks , think im gonna need it lol 😁
---
Tanks, and sure, DM me your IGN.
---
Lube isn't cheap you know. 😬
---
The length of a game isn't everything, but I'd be lying if it wasn't something I considered in prioritizing what games I buy.
---
A case in point is Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal.  Doom 2016 was a fantastic game, and it was made sweeter by the fact that it actually had a cross-platform level editor.  Okay, it wasn't as flexible as the tools from the original Dooms, but it was *something*.  The time I spent in the editor was vastly more than Doom itself.  Doom Eternal won't have this, and therefore I don't care that much about it.  Not because I think Doom Eternal will be a bad game, but it's not an experience worth $60 to me.  Subconsciously, I end up comparing all these things to games like Half-Life 2 and the litany of modding you had on it.  I'm sure fans of Bethesda games can relate.
---
Pretty sure my hours will rack up on anthem when I get it as well
---
Thank you! Know what would make it even awesomer? A working radio, or a jukebox with tracks selection. I mean, how many jukeboxes you've seen, that play only classical music?
---
I'm desperately trying to host workshop PVP on sundays PS4 PSNid Enterres.
---
You all HATE organizing so this is the preferred system. Join me or get griefed - simple objective determination.
---
IMO you prefer randoms and being treated like trash or OP would also be trying to organize. Spoon fed content will never be much fun.
---
Not true of FFXIV they tell me. 
---
They're not going to start again from scratch on a new engine.
---
The amount of work required would be massive, and they'd need to charge full price for that title, only to find the community in a complete outrage and unwilling to re-buy the same game on a new engine.
---
That boat left the pier a LONG time ago.
---
The function of game is in better shape now, but as real players make up the npc's, playerbase also has a lot to do with the game.  The first few weeks had a very different feel than it does now.  
---
im pretty excited..far cry new dawn is a strong maybe as well
---
I always check to see who else is in an area before entering.  Not such a big deal once you get above level 40 or so but at lower levels I stumbled into encounters with beasts 40 or 50 levels above me . . . and then noticed the presence of other players of levels similar to the beasts.  Now, I always check the map.
---
&gt;It would actually make way more sense if these dmg-% increase cards would work exactly like those resistance-% cards (barbarian/Evasive).
---
I really like that idea. Instead of 10/5/5% damage, they'd be something like "1% per point of [stat] up to 15" or whatnot. I've also requested that gun damage increase with stats as well. It wouldn't be realistic but... that doesn't seem to matter here.
---
I can see that - those events pump you with water all day long!
---
Dam right im fed up of damn mole rats eatin ma corn n tatos
---
I've been farming legendaries last couple of days and been getting wood armor and other useless crap, oh I mustn't forget the legendary junk and ammo off a three star deathclaw, so exciting to get that😡
---
Arguing philosophy with NPC's and making big moral decisions is overrated.
---
But thanks for the reply. :)
---
Such a refreshing rebuttal I’ve never heard that one, kettle meet water
---
I assume its sounds a little like this:  
---
[REEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtNaVFpw4Q)
---
Can you also fix the issue where if he spawns in the Ash Heap and walks over a fire pit on the ground in his path he just repeatedly dies/revives/dies until the timer runs out?
---
I never see GRAPE Nuka Cola out in the Wild..... SO I may need to buy that.
---
Quantum is an actual collector item as I actually hoard the ones I collect... Ill drink a cherry one here or there.. but NOOOO not the QUANTUM !!   **NEVER The Quantum**  !  
---
I want elevator and escalator options

My current residence in the Mire, I think it has presence.

I mean, the more experience they have fixing bugs means it'll be easier for them which should translate to 'less man hours' toward fixing bugs, which would make it cheaper, thus making it more likely that Single Player Experiences will have their bugs fixed...at least, more of their bugs will be fixed.
---
Thanks for the reply, though. I'll wait and see.
---
Did you figure it out? I build up in there every time and use the junk resource collector. 
---
"Hyper-aggressive" sounds like a PvP obsessed player to be honest.
---
What would the point be of setting up new servers then? Might as well just remove pacifist mode and be done with it...is that what you're saying?
---
If your armor CND go down 4 times (100% - 90% = 10% -&gt; 100% - 60% = 40%) as fast, of course you would feel it.
---
I could not agree more, I have all the beds so far and I just need that heart shaped one from FO3 in the slavers base
---
I was going to say rolling pin but I'm wrong.
---
Riiiiiiiight....
---
Exactly what it is
---
If they do it right, that won't be the case.
---
Let's say you can full min / max a character at level 100.
---
At level 100 I can one shot a level 68 scorched or mutant with my melee weapon.
---
Now if they up the level of that scorched or mutant to level 136 (basically double) they'd have more health and do more damage.  They can scale this up indefinitely.  So some areas will be too dangerous for lower level players and still a challenge for higher level players.
---
Oh great, I've been insulted on Reddit. Now I have to make a 20 minute long YouTube video defending myself from the "Bethesda fanboys" trying to keep me down!
---
is it sarcasm?
---
Why do people always address Bethesda in their posts? Does Bethesda care a single bit about reddit? Have we seen any official developers post here?
---
I agree. For now I just let them pile up and then drop them at places new players end up. 
---
I hope it's possible! Thanks for taking the time to respond! I appreciate you all!
---
If someone is in sneak you won't see them on the map and they could have chameleon on. So someone may have shown up there and caused the enemies to spawn.
---
I'm sure it happens randomly too or based on a timer maybe; but someone entering a building your in seems to always cause them to spawn again.
---
News flash, what mmorpg didn't have tons of glitches after release? Hmm let me think. 
---
 All of them
---
I think it's still only mods there. I haven't seen X-01 plans anywhere.
---
If you're on Xbox I've got a single calli shock mod you can have :)
---
Yeh thats a big scorch D &amp; B, Makes me laugh every time it comes up on the load screen.... Its always a big load.
---
I've made notice of this issue 1 week after game's launch, a month after that and 2 months again after last post. You guys never responded, even a friend of mine that regularly compiles a list of known bugs from the whole community included it in there, you still didn't notice. It took you 4 months to see this? You don't play your own game, I refuse to believe that you play it. Disgraceful.
---
*lol* I wasn't going to rail on you for that.  Landlocked CAMPs are a totally reasonable thing to do.
---
Sad to hear about the multi-pump idea, though.  I'll try yours out on Xbox!
---
I'd say it was removed because this sub is about Bethesda / Fallout 76 and not Bioware / Anthem.
---
I'm not saying you don't have a point or two, but just imagine someone came to your house and keeps quacking about how much better and nicer the house of your neighbor is. Wouldn't you too show him where the door is?
---
Just my 2 cent...
---
How much?
---
I actually didn't even play the beta unfortunately. 
---
Do it for science!
---
It's feedback, like they wanted, and for others to have a discussion. 
---
I am on Xbox
---
Not sure if it will work, but have you tried switching your equipped grenade to another type?
---
I will!
---
man, that would be so annoying. i love this event b/c of the silliness of the messages. 
---
I've not had it get stuck, but i've only done it a few times.
---
I've already got my legs shocked out, you can just have it man. It was just a coincidence that it was at the Bunker while I was doing my selling rounds.
---
I'm working right now, but I'll comment again once home and we can work it out :).
---
i have yet to find an irrelevant mag.
---
I hate when legendaries don't drop a corresponding star item.
---
I also hate it when the RNG masters give me a 3 star legendary wood left arm that's level 10.
---
They need to fix legendaries not dropping the correct star item.
---
They also need to UNDO the nerf that made it so legendaries didn't scale to your level.  Uranium Fever and other events are a joke now.  Not even worth doing.
---
Community managers post here often, and encourage people to use this forum for feedback.
---
Like they wanted? I don't recall any Bethesda announcements saying "and please post your ideas on reddit". Did I miss something?
---
In previous fallout games on Xbox,  you hold x to put away your gun. That worked for grenades too.  Haven't tried it in 76 yet
---
I don’t have any one or two shot legendary weapons to hit things easy. All my rifles take 10 shots to drop one baddie. 
---
Yes.
---
Maybe because you are talking about another company/game in Bethesda's official fallout 76 subreddit? Just saying thats most likely why its removed.
---
The down side to high level characters (HLC) helping low level characters (LLC) is that encounters in an area are keyed off the HLC rather than the LLC.  That means that very often the rewards will not be usable by the LLC right away, and that the baddies to be defeated are way more than a match for the LLC.  This can lead to feelings of frustration by the LLC when they can't really participate in a fight.
---
Community, community, community.
---
We're a small portion of the playerbase here and you act like we're the ambassadors of 76. 
---
If you decide that you're 'out', that's your call. But fuck I'm tired of seeing these posts that attempt to speak for everyone at once and paint a simple picture from a complex tapestry of interests. 
---
Your whining and foreshadowing of a 'nuclear meltdown' are not likely to get any game dev studio to change how they share information and what they share. 
---
Also, 'our enthusiasm and frustration'. I don't see much enthusiasm here these days. In fact, most of the enthusiasm I see for this game comes from chill players like the FilthyCasual sub, not the constant complaining and entitlement that gets tossed around here. xD  
---
Man, the agility courses killed me because I believed someone's "advice" that being overburdened wouldn't effect your performance.  For example, I timed the Camp Dawson course while carrying 1000 lbs extra stuff - couldn't complete it in less than 3.5 minutes due to loss of action points and having to stop to recharge them.   Finally, I waited until there were no other players within miles and took a chance storing heavy items (armour, big guns, etc.) in the most obscure looking containers on the premises and ran the course.  Finished with 30 seconds to spare . . . and "SURPRISE!" no server glitch, thieving griefer, or "programming feature" had disappeared my stashed items.  
---
Gamer tag?
---
I dont even sell. My friends and I know what ammo to collect for the others, then we all trade when we meet up. Its nice to give someone your junk ammo and get 500 of what you use in return.
---
I have the same issue sometimes, I can’t remember how I do it but I think I click onto my pip boy and it stops it. Worth giving that a go. 
---
I’m on right now
---
Commenting to watch later.
---
It's a glitch from the last patch,  fixing a previous gli5
---
I'm just asking this and not trying to be a troll, so please don't read snark into this.
---
Are community managers employees of BGS? Or volunteers working on their behalf?
---
Yeah, I've definitely experienced this at least three times. Kill a legendary and get no loot, then kill the normal enemies with it and one of them has a legendary item to loot.
---
No wonder Sanjay sounds so happy.
---
Make parts,  scrap them 
---
My heavy has been doing more outside PA - as you get high enough up you have perk points to switch around.  I'm using an Anti Armor gatling outside PA, but also have an Instigating Handmade that will one shot most enemies with sneak damage.  Stabilized is the one effect that requires PA, with AA I regain the armor penetration, but its just not as accurate without PA (larger spread, no accuracy bonus from Stabilized).
---
Mixed pieces for armor though - all 3\* with weight reduction.  Unfortunately they're only junk and food/drink/chems variety (don't need an ammo one but a weapon weight would be good).  I prefer marine personally if I can get those pieces, since they have some rad resist.
---
I won't be on for a few hrs, I'll let you know when I'm on though. GT is Daemonizare. Hell, I have a t-60 calli shock mod you can have too, if you want it :).
---
Some of these are seriously game-breaking bugs since people have been reporting since the start of beta. Stop making excuses for this shit; you're just enabling it.
---
I'm assuming paid employees. Either way they have direct access to the dev team and share feedback they get from here with them 
---
That's why I help them in areas that they have a good chance in and if they get overwhelmed, I step in to help.
---
I have never seen these posts. If you say that they're present, then I retract my original comment.
---
It's unfortunate that you feel the need to dismiss criticism as "toxic hatred campaign" you're effectively saying that the complaints don't matter because they're lies meant to slander the game when in reality these are true fans expressing their feelings about a game they had a lot of hope for.
---
That would be like me saying that the game continues to suffer thanks in part to mindless fans blindly supporting a game with critical flaws while carrying out a toxic campaign to silence criticism.
---
Let the lead flow like water.
---
I don't get attacked upon logging in but I do see an exp bar that says Level 1 (I'm level 80) followed by the exp gain sound along with the message +50 exp.    I have no idea why this happens, it just started a little over a week ago.
---
Or when we sell to other players to avoid scams make it so u can set a price on all of the bullets not per bullet
---
Yea im in the same boat, not really sure where to go from here. Was totally going to get metro but it is super short. Maybe anthem idk it doesn't look that great. 
---
Does anyone actually even use the 40? Lol
---
We realized we nerfed the TS-E too much so we are going to try and balance them out and make it so you don't have to repair your weapons every ten minutes. We also realized that you have to drink and eat more than it was originally so we are fixing that and last but not least we are looking into your feedback from last week and we are going to start communicating with the player base more.
---
Check out the atom shop
---
They should demonetize purified water, and de-rad boiled water.  Allow them to be use interchangeably for cooking.
---
No, I down-voted you because any time anyone has anything positive to say about the game some unimaginative troglodyte invariably responds with, "Ooh, you must work for Bethesda.", "Ooh, you're on the payroll."  You're just lip-syncing a line so damn basic and overplayed, that I get sick of seeing it in responses.  Some people are able to enjoy the game, even if you are not.  What is so hard to understand about that?  Or are you such an awe-inspiring Gaming GOD that if you're not having fun then it is utterly inconceivable that anyone else could be. I don't mind an intelligent debate about the issues and merits of the game, but simply mouthing dismissive tripe as if its a reflex adds nothing to the conversation.  Thus, my down vote. 
---
Hurr durr i play a dead glitchy game.
---
Honestly, with that squatting position, I was hoping he'd be pooping something out.
---
after 25 years all the radiation should be gone if u wanna talk scientifically. what're the rads even still there from?
---
More than make up for it if shootybang types could convert unwanted ammo into stuff they'd use. 
---
Fallout 2 style X-01 power armor paint. 
---
Heh heh. Im 32 and will giggle at crap like this. I agree with you though in terms of the state of the game. I love and support a lot of Bethesda does. I enjoyed TESO and Im shocked Bethesda didn't lean on Zenimax more for this or atleast draw from their experience to smooth out Fallout 76 more.
---
I really enjoyed playing it though. Just waitint for Anthem now. 
---
Ah. I understand. If you are on Xbox I can give you a Tse 50 cal. I don't mind. 
---
Fallout 2 style X-01 power armor paint.
---
Haven't tried, but I will!
---
Just keep checking those brown paper bags.  One of them is bound to have pepperoni rolls . . .
---
Tried that, and threw the grenade as soon as I exited the Pip Boy.
---
I know, I pick up plastic anywhere I see it.
---
The intent of my original question is to find out the best places to get the most plastic in the shortest amount of time :)
---
Open pipboy, release grenade button, close pipboy.
---
My most recent encounter: (loads the game... ) Huh.. I spawned with half HP. Huh... My rads are increasing. Then being blasted with some shit and a loud screech before I died. I avoid this creature at all cost at lvl44, but the game comes up with lame mechanics for a forced encounter. Oh, this wasn't the first time either.
---
kill. the .scorchbeast. queen. 8. billion . times.
---
Yeah bethesda used to be a insta buy for me, in 2011 piracy was still strong and my brother got the Skyrim torrent but i bought to support the company. After fo76 im done.
---
Go to the "Hot" tab on this sub. The threads they reply to are tagged as "Bethesda Replied" and there comments are stickied to the top of the thread.
---
Thanks. Sorry I had misunderstood you. Definitely a good trick for pump only when other water isn't available!
---
Ahh damn, it’s been a few weeks since I’ve played and I’m not a heavy grenade user. Sorry dude! 
---
I disagree on the place being avoided.  I do agree that these places can be dangerous at low levels: The thing I should have explained is to look at the map before you go there.  If the area is empty and you are the first person there, then check to see if the ghouls that spawn are lower level.  They are great EXP and I have successfully pulled plastic as low as level 8 from these places.  If there are high levels in the area, then your mileage may vary, but know this:   If they already killed everything and you show up to the area for the first time then new mobs will spawn and they are likely to be at your level.   The risk is worth the reward if you learn about these mechanics early on.   
---
I had discontinued use of the water pump for this exact reason (it's slow). Now, I'll be making use of it again when the need arises. Thanks!
---
Drop at your feet, think of it as a challenge.
---
You're welcome :)
---
nope i had a brain fart. i mixed x01 with ultracite.
---
Same , people praise games like god of war but i know i won’t have enough of 20+ hours.
---
That’s the reason i stick to games featuring builds( customization) or multiplayer game( smash ultimate and for honor gave me more than 200+ hours and it won’t stop soon)
---
Just here to say that I have not put 20 hours into Stanley Parable, yet I put it down and said Wow, that was amazing.
---
We should also be able to cook with Cola. 
---
Right, I know the little gnat flies are normal. I'm talking about the 3-4 very large ghost bugs that appear towards the end.
---
it will be fixxed next patch when they roll back other fixxes. Then it will its self be rolled back to fix those glitches. I think the dev team is just looking for job security.
---
There are no plans for X01.
---
I trade like crazy in FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits, and have never once seen one X01 mod plan up for sale or trade.
---
If you need mods for your armor, and you're sick of server hopping, go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  Jetpacks and shocks are pretty expensive 2k to 5k each, but others are less expensive.  If you need more caps, sell your spare ammo, junk, and legendary items there.  Great way to get trading done and fun to do!
---
Here's the problem, the way they set up the perk system (not to mention the fact that they're Still Rebalancing things) encourages people to try different builds and switch out between. I don't think the stash size should be too big but needs to be bigger to accommodate players who want to switch builds.
---
The other issue is later in the game when you score more legendary items, it's hard to sell them all off. That's why I've suggested a grinder like in the Borderlands PS : you put in a few items and you get one different one. Someone else suggested making it a vault raid reward if they don't want people overusing it which I think is fitting. 
---
I think you could get the cards as you get them now.  If the card has a passive effect on it, then it can simply be applied to your character the moment you get the card.  This uses the K.I.S.S. principal.  Active effect cards or cards with both passive and active effects would still need to be slotted for the active portion of their effects to occur.  If you want your weapons to last longer, those effects are active, but if that card also means you can craft higher level weapons then that part of the card just becomes a learned skill.  
---
From a game design standpoint one way to implement this is to add an attribute to all characters for all the possible passive skills that they could learn in the game.  As they get a card that has the passive skill, the flag on the character knowing that skill gets set.   Just like how recipes and plans currently work.  Once you "know" the passive effect (once you've earned it by getting the necessary perk) then it is yours all the time.  
---
/u/Ladydevann any ideas? I tried to submit a ticket but it isn't clear what category to submit it under. 
---
Downvotes, but no actually rebuttal from anyone on this sub. No wonder the devs don't want to talk to you directly.
---
I see. That big latch that reintroduced all the fixed issues. This new Austin studio is terrible. 
---
Just make the changes and change it again if it is too much. Energy weapons have been dead in the water sense release if they overbuff them then the situation isn't any worse than it was. The slowness of iteration on these changes is mindblowing. 
---
Yes, this happens to me on log in and basically you are camped on an enemy spawn point.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as you can find locations that spawn mostly things like molerats and wolves (read: food).  But unfortunately the more off the main roads you go and the more interesting your camp location, the more likely it is to attract a bunch of enemies every time you travel there.
---
Thank you! So, those three large bugs that appear as ghosts aren't supposed to appear? 
---
Thanks for the share, agreed - very moody. Can you post others? CAMP pics are always interesting. Unless they're mine.. my uh, design and location is pedestrian.
---
Bethesda Austin is terrible IMO. This game is proof that they're incapable of maintaining a game of this significance. 
---
I feel your pain.    I've been trying to unlock the buttress mod for the marine armor chest and I am easily over 120 pieces.    Rubber can be a pain, which reminds me, please leave the rubber supply at the Grafton High School alone!   Asbestos for the armor, now that is a bit tedious.
---
THERE ARE PAINTINGS ON THE WALL IN WHITESPRINGS THAT VANISH. LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE. 
---
Seriously though, why does he write 1001 glitches several times? I counted about 50 bugs in that list and a lot of them are very inconsequential. Is he really just counting multiple occurrences of the same glitch and then pasting that to his video to get views? If so, it's pretty misleading.
---
The water supply has active virus in it.  It’s how new mutants keep popping up.
---
Hahaha
---
Well handled!
---
I'm not OP, but Fallout 76 is also in my top 10 games of all time. Witcher 3 and Dying Light are also in my top 25 and put hundreds of hours into both, and I'm enjoying FO76 as much as both of those.
---
One reason I'm enjoying it so much is I'm playing it coop with another friend, so the quest lines are just a side part of the game.  If you're playing it solo that might be one reason the game isn't so much your thing.
---
I've complained about the naming conventions with my friends. It's one of many things that's annoyed me about the inventory interface.
---
I don’t think it’s a direct relation, but generally, yeah. However I don’t think “weightless” matters for it.
---
How does heavy metal armor compare to BoS combat and heavy combat armor?? I have a heavy metal set, heavy raider set, and a heavy leather set of armor jus to play with 
---
He can control animals and robots.  They turn pink while controlled.   It’s cool that it applies to scorchbeasts!
---
It says in the item description before you click purchase what you can apply it to. You didn't *get* bamboozled. You bamboozled yourself. 
---
its more a misunderstanding of the concept 
---
basically the current powered water filter / industrial filter / pump all need either water or dirt to be placed on. But this also limits you to areas of large dirt open locations. 
---
By adding in things like planters and water catchers that auto boil the collected water we now can build say on a lake or in a railway car or on the roof of a building - suddenly having access to a much larger build area and more creative concepts.
---
I feel like increasing the stash size is one simple move Bethesda could take right now that will raise the morale of the remaining players.  After all the mishaps of patch 5 and the recent nerfs, a much need QOL improvement goes a long way to start mending the game.
---
I assume they will have higher level gear in future updates, so people won’t be overleveled for the new content, as their gear will be under leveled.
---
Same here. I attempt to do quests but instantly get turned off that all I’m doing is collecting holotapes from corpses 
---
He is definitely overreacting to a lot of the bugs. He may be analyzing them, which is fine and even useful (if that was actually his intent), but making a video called '1001 glitches' that includes a lot of petty shit most gamers wouldn't notice is a sad cash-in on 76 negativity, imo. 
---
rad storms and rainwater both are radioactive in game so its there not sure why but it is
---
Because it’s true. Nobody enjoys a shit show but the person who took the shit. 
---
Did you know the bomb actually impacts the ground? It might even have impact damage.
---
I was trying to get the ground zero achievement (which apparently isn’t a thing on PC, but that’s another thing) and managed to get dead center. I died at the same time a giant upside down cone appeared basically on top of me; the actual explosion didn’t go off until a second or two after the “impact” and my death. 
---
I did it on purpose last night for the trophy. Stripped off all my armor and went streaking through Whitesprings. Good times. 
---
Its it coming out this weekend or the 22nd? I may get it.
---
I don't think it work with much perks.
---
That's just the noteworthy stuff! I can't tell you how much trash I threw away
---
Yes but he got laid :p
---
What's that equivalent to in real world currency?
---
They can and will mind-control any non-player entity in the game to attack you. Even your own base turrets!
---
wow u are right!! i thought it was this friday!! :( :(
---
Yea I would love this implemented so I can my my BoS character seem more like a well armed military soldier then a simple wastelander 
---
Just reverse the crafting recipe, and increase the number of bullets required. For example: It takes 5xGunpowder,  8xLead, and 12xSteel to make 12 rounds of .308 ammo, so maybe allow for scrapping 24 rounds of .308 to get 5xGunpowder, 8xLead, and 12xSteel. This would be a 50% ratio, but that can be tweaked to whatever Bethesda thinks is appropriate (probably a lot less than this based on scrapping weapons).
---
Just throw everything into your stash and use a crafting bench--it tells you haw many of each required component you have available when you look at crafting something.
---
Start the game.  Disoriented because I can't recognize where the server has dropped me.  Get attacked by one or more Scorchbeasts because I've landed in the midst of a battle involving several other players at higher levels than me.  Die.  Respawn  . . . somewhere.  Try desperately to get back to the spot where I dropped all that "junk" I'd been accumulating for several days just to be able to repair my armour/weapons.  Die, again.  Respawn . . . somewhere.  Head for my dropped loot . . . again.  Meet an enemy at my level and take it out but forget and grab loot from the corpse.  Get closer to my dropped loot.  Die, again.  Respawn . . . somewhere.  Head for my dropped loot but realize it's the "new" dropped loot from my most recent kill.  Keep going . . . the marker for my original dropped loot is still there.  I finally reach the spot and "Voila!," there's the marker hovering over an empty patch of ground . . . and nothing else.  
---
Alternatively, Start the game.  Get into the midst of a combat I might actually win.  Dropped by Server.  Restart the game.  Items missing from inventory.  Quests previously in progress not displayed.  Interrupted combat starts all over again . . . maybe with a newer, tougher cast of characters but always with all their health restored and all my ammunition/stim packs depleted.  
---
Repeat until frustration level reaches the point of no return . . .
---
Nah, I really do want to look like a homeless raider. It's a wasteland for Atom's sake.
---
I'll try it again, but I swear I've tried that and it hasn't worked.
---
Yea I guess they see the the market now is leaning towards weird colorful things so they believe that by adding more of this type would bring in more cash 
---
Conan Exiles has a thing that tells you who did something to your base or whatever, but it can be used as a sort of stitching witch hunt tool to go after someone who only used a tool bench and didn't loot. 
---
I've seen Nuka Tapper in the wild as well but I can't remember where. 
---
HPL references for the win!
---
AWE plus SOME !!!
---
Yea I’m all in it for this by I’m pretty sure that the atom shop is going to be used to finance the game in the long run. Plus with how easy it is to get atoms by doing the quest it’s not for their best interest
---
Boiling water leaves the solid state materials behind as it turns into a vapor goes through a filter and leave the water cleaner then standard boiling - because of chemicals as well as things like the FEV virus in the fallout world that are not in standard world settings the idea of our world survival is not a good reference.
---
Thus freaking boiled water - on a mechanical in game terms I just didn't want to have to spend wood to boil water I was collecting and was like hey these people are gamers they will understand what I mean and realize this guys just trying to add a quality of life item in the game so we can cook with ease and hey now think of all the places I can build now that I don't need dirt to place things on....
---
Ha ha yea, he was originally squatting directly over the junk resource...
---
Watoga high school
---
Specifically plates, utensils, those stupid pumpkins
---
for me its always a random scorch commander with some kind of half mile sniper pistol 
---
I picked it up last week with low expectations. Haven't been disappointed. I've had fun and it was worth the $28 I paid for it (PC, used) on Amazon. Had to learn slightly different style of gameplay from the previous fallouts (stash limitations being the biggest adjustment) and I'm still trying to quicksave before dangerous looking situations, but if you like the others, you'll like this one as well.
---
 think I bought mine post patch. days kind of blur at this point so I'm not 100% on that
---
The CM's are doing everything they can given what they can actually do, and they're honestly doing a great job of remaining very active.
---
It's purely the development side. We're getting basically zero information from the developers, which seems unsurprising given that they don't even seem capable of working on the game without breaking the shit outta it or making pants-on-head stupid design choices.
---
I'd still LOVE to see a deep dive/post-mortem on the pre-launch development and what they thought would happen post-launch, because there's still so much confusion as to how on earth the game ended up being the dumpster fire it's been. But sadly it seems that development continues to be a black hole where all player feedback and bug reports are sucked in and seemingly little to nothing ever escapes.
---
I did get bamboozled
---
By myself.
---
Good job! You’re so smart! *tustles hair*
---
Oh this talking point! I really do love this one, it's one of my favourites.
---
1) Power Armour displays (just copy in the ones from FO4)
---
2) A two handed melee sword (use some Skyrim assets for all I care)
---
3) CAMP Elevators (again copy the ones form FO4)
---
People have played Tetris for 100s of hours as well, that doesn't make it a $80 game.
---
they sell them at some vendors but the plans cost 1539 caps
---
As a fellow T-51b wearer I hear ya :-( 
---
yeah but if I get a coupon for 50% off something I don't complain I paid full price either 
---
Love this idea!
---
There's still quite a lot of bugs in the game. Majority are just minor things such as graphical glitches. But there are some biggies too for example theres an event called "feed the people" stay well away from that. Through a menu bug it can cause you to deposit items from your inventory and you'll never see them again.
---
I've had a great time playing but also found myself frustrated at times when faced with some of the bugs. The world is brilliant, hits all the correct fallout notes. The main quest line is fun but the end game is quite lacking. So if you do hop in make sure you take your time as there currently isn't much waiting at the end. 
---
maybe someone abandoned their copy. but im referring to a dedicated location. its always in your starting terminal (as far as i know)
---
Just play the game in the way that they intended for you to play it. /s
---
My initial base was in the northern mountains so I only had the pumps since I hadn’t found the ground purifier. Ended up finding the larger purifiers that go in the water first so decided I’d go ahead and move to the water. Was super excited to get rid of a huge source of my radiation (those five rads you take whenever you collect)
---
Nope, can’t use purified water to cook soup and shit so now I’m stuck still using dirty water and boiling it
---
honestly I'd love to build a cliff side house cause of stupid animals constantly eating my plants I've even made a indoor greenhouse and walked in to see a super mutant hand grenading my corn had spawned inside....
---
they actually showed planters in the preview videos if you remember back
---
Shopping plaza Watoga advanced power connector plans
---
this is what i do, and it works for me on PC.
---
if i have hit my "alt" key, then realize i do not want to toss grenade, i keep the "alt" button pressed, and then just hit the TAB button.  i alt/tab out of game, i click right back in, and grenade is stored.
---
probably not very viable if you are in a crowd of enemies, but then i play a sniper, so i am rarely in close contact with enemies.  i usually toss grenades at charging enemies, then bail the scene, turn, fire, toss, bail, repeat.
---
That's why it's so stupid it wasn't done from the start.
---
More available ammo? I assume you mean as loot? You can craft 50cal at about ~210 rounds a pop with crafting perks... 
---
they dont exist in real life
---
Sort by Component?
---
Nice.
---
A big-ass burly bulky bushy bristly beefcake bastard of a beard.
---
And stuff that looks more badass.  There are enough cutesy/whimsical items in the shop already.
---
I found this out when I got the alert that the bomb was dropping on Whitespring, I thought I could fast travel to my camp on the golf course and make it into the resort before impact. Turned out I was wrong. 
---
Oof, instigating faster swing grognak's is my favorite legendary of all time, I'm sorry.  And no, you didn't "drop it without realizing it" as the people defending this bug like to allege (why they defend a bug I'm not entirely sure).
---
That's distilling, not boiling.
---
Not the left, so it's the one that's left.
---
I'd rather have both options - more options mean a longer game life so why not add both - just because you don't use a ton of purified water for anything doesn't mean others don't though and thus it limits them.
---
Like I dilute and craft a ton of stimpacks which means I could need hundreds of water for it - I'm not wasting my purified water on soup when I can get free unlimited dirty water with a hazmat suit and a bathtub of blue water when I need my purified water to make stimpacks to heal my team mates 
---
HA!  i some times think this is their 1st mmo!
---
I'm still trying to figure out why, with all the encouragement to bulk items to reduce weight and minimize inventory, are bulked items still classed as "junk?"  
---
Same with the PC. I keep my radio on and I know it's safe to move when the music starts.
---
Excavator.  Skins.  Everyone on every server looks the same. 
---
Not rare I found several just scrapped them and ended up learning the plan to make. 
---
I found one like "more damage to the Grafton monster" If you ask me that's super useless
---
well you need vault dwellers with out radiation tainting to make proper super mutants and the master doesnt even start doing that for 3 months after the in game clock over on the west coast. 
---
So "proper" fallout super mutants dont even exist yet. 
---
I agree!!
---
Nice tip. Thanks for that. 
---
I used to keep my camp near mountain ridge so a  pump was necessary. Hates the slow response for the next collection. I once tried to use several pumps and use them one after another. Then I realize the animation was based on the character not the pump it self.
---
The one that does not specify is for the excavator. Just \_finally\_ installed it in mine!
---
X-01 armour plans awarded for completing promotion to rank of "General" for the Enclave.
---
Yeah I had that happen once. Was randomly invited to group and took it to launch the nuke for the scorched queen event. some numbnut in the party didn't have passive on and engaged in pvp after the queen was taken down. I wasn't even participating and I got taken down, with my fluxes getting looted. 
---
In the future I know to drop party the moment after the queen is killed.
---
Kind of why I stopped grouping up at whitespring nuke zones
---
Irony is. I am a support/heal build. (50+ radaway 250+ stim packs 80+ super stims) rad sponge and all that. If you guys want to be idiots and kill each other, I'm more than happy to stim you back up but leave me out of it.
---
If you liked destiny you’ll like anthem. If you think anthem is not going to be like destiny, you are making a mistake.
---
I can’t place any Atom shop items anywhere but my own camp on Xbox. 
---
Yup just looked it up, apparently if you sign up for origins monthly sub you can get it early. Only 99 a year or 14 a month. Probably going to sign up tonight. I hope it holds me over until Bethesda gets it together cuz F76 is my #1.
---
There is that community patch notes, you can see where what plans are on which vendor based on those changes. 
---
Like this?
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5509/](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5509/)
---
Bandolier perk lads, 80% lighter 
---
Its not worth losing the Lone Wanderer damage mitigation most times for those extra bonuses.  That's a noticeable difference.
---
I've recently taken to picking them up, but returning loot if a person comes back looking for it.  Failing that, I dump a ton of that excess junk into the cash register at Artisan's Corner, or the suitcase at Watoga station. I've never come across a bag with stable flux, but I've definitely lost a few. Still learning the lesson of stashing the flux before I go back for more killing.
---
I mean, if you've decided that everything is garbage except one specific combination of legendary effects you're setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
I have a hard time believing that not a single item out of 100+ legendaries was of any use.
---
It's literally 3 hours long. You commented without even looking at it, which is what I imagine all the downvoters do to any criticism of the game. 
---
really really weird
---
The point is to win back trust. If they stop developing FO76 it's actually desatrous. People feel lied and cheated already, but just stopping FO76 would equal a stab in the back of the community, and the community will stab back even harder. The reputation is already damaged alot, but that move would completely remove bethesda from the list of "devs to buy stuff from". Because, while EA and Ubisoft are greedy and shitty companies, the games they deliver do work, unlike bethesda games. 
---
Are you high? Outside of software, it's pretty common to get refunds on things you aren't satisfied with. People do often get refunds on movies (at least , if they request a refund in a theater while it's still in progress. I haven't head of refunds at the end). People get refunds on restaurant meals, even though they have may have eaten significant portions. People get refunds on clothes, with the exception of undergarments. Appliances. Hardware. Grocery items. Books!  
---
Unless you mean movies purchased as physical or digital media. That's an area where industries have managed to get the general populace to accept an exception. They told us that they couldn't do refunds because this type of content could be copied. They continued this policy even as more and more games became tied to keys and service platforms where copying the content digitally wouldn't ever matter.  
---
Because we allowed this exception, we've pretty much given these industries to just shovel crap on us without recourse. I'd argue the opposite. Capitalism doesn't work right WITHOUT such consumer protections such as refunds being available. Otherwise, you end up with bad actors that get away cheating many consumers. Tough luck. You pressed the button that said "Accept", so now you are subject to all of our limitations and you can't take us to court because there's a forced arbitration clause that you just accepted.
---
It's like living that Futurama episode where Fry contracts worms and they make him a superhero.
---
Just curious.  What are the vendor costs of these mods?
---
Someone traded me an X01 Torso with Jetpack mod installed for 900 caps long ago, been using that since.  But now I'm making my own X01, I am trying to get 2x Calibrated Shocks.  Sort of casually.  Checking Bunker daily, occasionally hopping half a dozen times.
---
Don't really want to buy from another player.  Just curious what base cost at the vendors are.  I notice the plans for the T-60 and Excavator Calibrated Shocks I found in Harper's Ferry and Welch were really cheap back before the vendor update.  I was hoping that the prices for these mods stayed cheap (not like the plan price increases).  And so far the ones I've seen show up were still relatively cheap.
---
I can get pacify to come up, but not tame.  That is with  both Wasteland Whisperer and Animal friend maxed out and equipped. 
---
Is that a unyielding set of armor? how do you manage to get 24/25 agi/per?
---
He won't be coming back to give you an explanation, he just doesn't like anyone criticizing the game so anyone who does is "going downhill" 
---
Sorry sub police 
---
Can confirm this vs two camp destroyers.  I was able to kill one using the scope but couldn’t vats the guys.
---
Holy shitsu this works !  Thank you.  Yay!!!’ The game has made up for .00001 of the Grief of disconnects,  lost items and screwed economy from duper’s 
---
$40 USD in PlayStation store
---
No, it was a magazine.
---
No the survival server will do that as high lvls will randomly shoot other people running around in their underwear 
---
Also as I can't stand rust I wouldn't wish any game to become it.
---
and to distill something you have to boil it
---
Easiest way:  bring up your quick selection wheel (i.e. mousewheel on PC).  
---
That's how I do it.  Wheel, release grenade key, cancel wheel.
---
Im sure it will be a big list, SB will be the biggest changes. Which im really looking forward to, i avoid fighting them right now. They also mention, heavy weapons changes, hopefully we see some steps towards that on the next patch.
---
I don't blame you. I tried to keep the faith and hoped they could put out this dumpster fire, but I think it's a lost cause. The problems are too big, go too deep, and the progress has been too minimal. I used to love Bethesda. I may never buy a game from them again now.
---
Ghillie suit. It would be the only thing I would BUY atoms for
---
Weird!
---
Added and reported, thanks!
---
I'd play as a super mutant - shoot, just make it a skin
---
They really need to up the bladed weapons in this game. Even just skins would make me happy.
---
All power armor paints should work for all power armor models...xo1 escavator and ultracute included.
---
White clean power armor paint.
---
All power armor should be equally as powerful just distribute the stats so that the benefit of 1 vs another is situational. Xo1 is better in high rads areas. Raider  maybe have some DPS buff but a bit less armor.
---
Escavator leg mods for other PA models. I would like to have the +200 carry wt on my X01. 
---
Alt X01 helmet ...I personally hate this helmet and would like a more streamlined version of the t60.
---
Gauss rifle skin. To me the gauss rifle is a hi tech weapon and I dislike how patchwork it looks. I would like a big black futuristic skin that is sleek and has some glowing blue buttons and lines.
---
Clean black suit.
---
Deliverer or p99 skin.
---
Normal non idiotic hairstyles for females. Maybe a few basic haircuts for guys that don't involve pomadour anything.
---
Vertical half walls. 
---
Non messed up powered doors.
---
Hope you can add pole hook as I need plans for my 3 star legendary 
---
I think bloodied sports equipment armor skins would be awesome. 
---
Wearable animal skins.
---
Skull/spike raider style armors.
---
I think because of the Era and style of Fallout a beaver panel PA would be hilarious. 
---
A dirty trashy garbage pail type armor with banana peels and garbage and slime and shit. 
---
Also simple multicolored paint to mix and match colors on different items. I want to roll with a crew all in black armor  with red accents. Etc. 
---
yes we should be able to grow most of the plants in the game is my opinion
---
Thanks for being reasonable and understanding my evolving perspective!  
---
I still have days I want to see it all burn down, especially since I've not been able to play since last week due to horrific loot lack (I'm not going to stand around for 5 minutes per corpse... come on!) but it's important to keep things civil!
---
Every once in a while I read a complaint about a game where my thought process while reading is: 
---
"Of all the namby-pamby trivial crap to complain about, you pick this one tiny little minor annoyance and--
---
Huh.
---
Still, it's a hard problem and they just went with a solution that--
---
Wait.
---
Okay, I'm with you, but fixing it would be a big change and--
---
Nope.
---
You're totally right.
---
Now I have one more thing to be annoyed about."
---
What about energy weapon ammo?
---
Are you being intentionally obtuse, or are you really just not that bright? The context here is boiling. Distilling was never mentioned until you tried to tell me how boiling removes radioactive dust. Try to cover your ass all you'd like, you made a mistake. Take your hit and move on.
---
wow... 
---
Good to know.  
---
But why does it seem to always fix it for me...
---
Could it be someone on our lists when it occurs is "bugged" causing the problem?
---
 Graham  is set as invincible you cant damage him, the other vendors just go down to 1hp
---
"Not us!"
---
anything really to spruce up the camp.  at least change the shelves plans to have stuff on them
---
I was lucky to find that and pick it up when it was available.  I was rocking that and the halloween skull mask instead of the helmet so I could give the Black Templar Chaplain treatment to all the heretics I met. 
---
I was doing it with power armor on and take dirty water directly in the lake in front of my house.  There's no animation and you can just spam that button and you get it as fast.  You seem to get a bit less radiation since your in power armor. Haven't logged in for a while so don't know if they patched it.
---
"A lot of petty shit most gamers wouldn't notice"
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure most gamers wouldn't notice things like invulnerable enemies, their CAMP items mysteriously doubling, near seizure inducing lighting flickering, crashes every other hour, character models glitching out every other minute and more.
---
Defending the game like you're attempting to do now makes you look like a lunatic.
---
Glowing mass, hardened mass, and radiated fluid is used to stabalize different kinds of flux.
---
Ionized meat is for people to eat who have certain perks. It doesnt rot.
---
As a level 75 that is in the middle of changing from ranged to a melee build, can we hold off on the melee nerf.  Further, let's not nerf anything for a couple of patches.  Devs always seem to take it too far.
---
Agree with pretty much everything else.  Love the game.  
---
Great list!
---
Pester me if you don't see them added in a day or so, working on the NPC's today!
---
Actually enforcer works on the queen too... it's great my friends and I use it. She might still hop around but she will stay grounded until she re heals... then rinse and repeat 
---
Idc about an escalator but an elevator would be nice
---
I found him in whitesprings once let’s just say was mush by the time the robots were done with me
---
Thanks :)
---
Does eating it regen hp? What's flux used for? Tryna find a reason to craft lol good too much mats 
---
You'll leave your poop bags of ammo randomly around vendors and your camp and you'll like it!!
---
I upvoted...but this seems a lil too P2W for me

eh, whats the worst that can happen from accepting random invites.

---
What fountain?
---
Well, the issue remains more than a couple people are reporting not finding any technical data until they turn in the one they have, so it could be erratic operation of the quest...  
---
That said, that is another flawed fix.
---
They really need to add a few free items for those sticking about. One free per four paid items maybe?
---
Plans for the armor itself must be acquired from the computer terminal inside the Armory that you gain access to after getting your promotion.
---
Plans for mods do not exist. 
---
You'd be in PvP heaven, if that's your thing.  Every other player who encountered you would shoot out of pure reflex.  
---
I would LOVE a 2H Bastard sword or sumthin
---
Either do I, but who wanted to stay married anyway! /s
---
Dude you read the paperwork in the Nuka Cola factory.? They were pumping in some seriously weird shit into those flavors. 
---
Did not realize that. Then I never played much with energy weapons or explosives in FO4.
---
I sell mine you get good caps for it
---
caps at 5 turned it all at once
---
No, nerf the melee. My TSE build gets nerfed because of all the whiny melee users....NERF THE MELEE!!!!
---
Yeah I currently rock "The Survivalist" Beard. Dammit I want it to be more unruley and old miner prospector looking.
---
As soon as I find them
---
My wishes: Co-Op only... add 10x the size of the current map... remove fast travel... add vehicles
---
It took me 3 days too sell all of mine. Broke ass vendors 
---
Scraps likely arent that big...
---
I think switching weapons stops the grenade from cooking
---
I assume that it was just an oversight that never got corrected. Like how recipes call for Pure Flux but the name is actually Stable Flux (or the other way around, I don't remember.) Silly mistake, easy to fix, nothing has been done. Same goes for all the spelling mistakes that have been around for a quarter of a year.
---
The list I had been working on
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16xa6bFTuXsQ32hRTqevWHNirGB6D93KKqmWeqaTx-EU/edit?usp=sharing
---
Then you enable Pacifist Mode and that should prevent you from damaging CAMPs. If you play PvP then it's on you to watch what you're shooting.
---
The only real answer.
---
What is your build and rifle?
---
How about it showing double of PA parts and fusion cores (in pipboy screen) even though only one of each is equipped?
---
What?!? That's such a stupid commit. This isn't about playing x amount of hours making it worth x amount of dollars. The point of the comment about playing hundreds of hours is that for a game that many consider unplayable, or broken, or a hot mess, or whatever it is that's the hot topic to complain about, that they've played it an awful lot. You bought a product. You played the product. There was no implied amount of hours you are going to get out of it. You're not entitled to anything more than what you got day-1.
---
Somebody inanother thread said the Brotherhood plans are in the Grafton vendor’s data but not actually for sale.  As far as I know, none of them carry these plans while they did before patch. 
---
Eat a stimpak 😂😂
---
Great idea! Maybe when they allow private servers that'll be a thing. One of my favorite parts of FO4 was building settlements, and based on Reddit I'm not the only one.
---
A backpack, definitely.  And that dam non-existent brown flight helmet!!!!
---
They are matching the enthusiasm of the majority of the player base... And giving up on it
---
I'll be able to get on in like 5 hours. If that doesn't work could you record a video?
---
First six attempts at "Belly of the Beast" - six server drops and six restarts from scratch.  Gave up in frustration - two weapons broken, all ammunition gone - stopped playing for two days.  Picked up the game and accumulated ammunition/repaired weapons.  Went to Watoga and attempted "Belly of the Beast," again.  Made it to "Glassy Cavern" without a single server drop but was killed while inside. Respawned - killed instantly by Scorchbeasts.  Respawned - killed instantly by Scorchbeast.  Respawned - bruised and battered but made it back into the Cave.  Server drop - lost all accumulated dropped loot.  Have not been back to Watoga since.
---
Ionized meet is great as food I love getting this.
---
Hardened mass is used to create pure stable flux. It’s one of the harder materials to get and is quite valuable for flux makers. Lands in your junk so make sure to store it in or stash or give it to your alt character for safe keeping. It’s also quite heavy in your stash. You also need high radiation fluids and glowing mass to make flux which is used to build things like the decontamination arch and various armour and power armour 
---
The main reason I don't wear my X01 armor and jet pack.  People see it  and they think  "griefing douche bag" because it's true.

Flux - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9y71wg/flux_how_you_get_it_and_why_you_need_it_hint_its/

Ionized meat should say what it does. I think carnivore perk gives double bonus and no disease. And i think there are other perks item abilities people use with the meat.
---
I can only imagine how much time these actually take. so to start, thank you for doing these bug roundups. 
---
I looked through the majority of the bug reports and didnt see this one, or may have looked it over among the mass amount of things to be fixed haha.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/WHDUCPM](https://imgur.com/gallery/WHDUCPM)
---
bug i get quite often while using the handmade rifle and combat rifle. itll show the base of the scope instead of viewing through it. ive noticed the frequency of it happening is slightly higher after throwing a grenade/molotov. 
---
if this has already been covered than my apologies and keep up the great work.
---
I have long hair and a big beard in real life.  Strangers sometimes make ZZ Top comments.  In the game I just look like Jesus.  Sigh.
---
Just turn on your jukebox and curl into a fetal position in your sleeping bag, and you'll be fine.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I'm probably being dense here... but if we're able to carry around 2000 lbs worth of junk, wouldn't it make more sense to just reduce the max carry weight and instead have increased storage space?    Seems like it would take up less server memory or whatever.    Things go back to their actual weight in the stash.
---
C
---
I see you and I getting downvoted for liking pink PA paint. Some people are awfully sensitive about a color. 
---
Ionized meat for food and unstable flux as a drink were pretty smart additions by the developers. Together they mean that you don't need to worry much about cooking, food, or drink while in nuke zones. Just pick them up as you need them. They're meals-ready-to-eat. 
---
The downside is that they're heavy, so despite availability and lack of spoilage, most players won't switch to an all nuke-zone diet. 
---
You seriously have no understanding of how online games work, do you?
---
When a game is released, with the promise of further updates, then yes, one would he entitled to that.
---
Sell it to other players. (I sold 80 ionized meat yesterday for 20 caps a piece)
---
Id be happy with being able to drop them where I want and making them explode with a well placed sniper shot. It would give me a reason to keep them when I find them. Quick mini nuke booby trap would be a great use for us light gunners. Or at least let us sell/scrap them
---
After last night, I believe it as well. On one standard (non-nuked) Whitespring run I encountered 4 different 3star charred ghouls in one spawning of the golf club (of course, as is typical, they all had 1star loot, but still...) 
---
They even have them dotted around. Theres a watchtower with them on the way up the stairs.. so annoying
---
I also do weekly and daily  as my main chores, another tip is to do them with an alt character, you get atoms for leveling up a new character, it’s easier to hit the level up challenge. If you over encumbered like me it is easier for you alt to fast travel to various locations plus there are a bunch of other challenges that an alt can help with. I mix the challenges up with my prime and alt characters for a balance and try find creative ways to get the challenge done the quickest and easiest way possible as some of them are tedious 
---
i dont agree.  someone took your stuff free and clear.  its unfortunate for you but thats just the way it is in dog eat dog world of appalachia.  you risked it in a end-game environment of nuked area and whining you cant get your stuff back?  get over it.  be more prepared next time.  
---
I love when this is always in the middle of these issues. 
---
Google has failed me and the Bethesda site has no direct way to read old patch notes....
---
I mean, the tse did need a nerf but I think how they went about it was wrong. I don't really think exploding and two shot should be able to be together, they should both be major prefixes. Melee would still be good, just more on par with how ranged weapons are. They should always have counters. 
---
Glowing blood + antiseptic makes glowing blood packs, which is +75 rad resistance. I find it valuable because, unlike Rad-X (+100 Rad Resist), glowing blood packs don't suppress mutations.  
---
I was playing FO76 with friends.  My friend would come over and he would play using remote play and I'd have it up on my TV.  Occasionally he'd group up with his clan mates from Destiny 2 as well and I would join them. 
---
It was fun, until we started to get burned out on the tedium and bugs.  I was even enjoying starting to go down the path of taking notes and creating my typical excel spreadsheets of the stuff in the game (such as ROI on different foods). I stopped caring the moment I started having serious server issues and crashes after the last patch.  Happens on all my characters, and typically if I'm on the same server with my friend, it impacts him as well. 
---
I gave up until they say they have fixed the issue, but the continued lack of communication, going onto another week with no patch or even a scheduled date for a new patch, I'm on the edge of just giving up completely.  
---
You bought the red bat skin!   I missed that one.   
---
I love it. Just needs a little love in the balancing department lol.
---
haha... Where is the promis for patches and updates? DLC maybe... But they could cancel all that and we'd probably have no standing for a refund. Again, as I've stated before, YES- Beth is going to patch and update the game, they have been, but you are not entitled to that and demanding it the way so many have is completely childish.
---
Last of us? God of War? Rugrats: search for Reptar? Those were all good games with less than 20 hours. Hahaha maybe not the last but I remember it for this combo somehow.
---
Why do we get rads from collecting water? It’s kind of dumb. I understand drinking dirty/boiled water but we shouldn’t get it from just collecting it.

any new info on **where a Radaway recipe is?**

I made the mistake early on and wasted most on a rifle I'm still not at level to use.
---
currently grinding trying to bulk up on resources before I kick back into the campaign or somewhere Ill get butchered.
---
you could have gotten a duped set of PA.
---
Remove one of each item from the PA Frame and see what happens.  
---
If you have one in your inventory and one in the frame, it dupped (have had it happen twice).
---
Destroy the duped set as Bethesda has made vague threats of punishing people duping even unintentionally.

Really, but dont you take radiation damage when using them?

Those 5,000 Atoms combined with what I've earned in the game have gotten me, in no particular order, note - I don't recall offhand what everything is called in the game, so some names don't match up to actual Atoms Shop names:
---
Succulents
---
Painted Door
---
Craftsmen Door
---
Modern Fireplace
---
Mid Century Modern Chandelier
---
Old Possum Beer Sign
---
Swing Arm Floor Lamp
---
Tuxedo
---
Christmas Bundle (I wanted the Christmas lights and snowman)
---
White String Lights
---
The Inspector outfit
---
Cloche Hat
---
I thought it was a subliminal way to encourage reusing plastic, over and over again. 
---
Does this actually work on x01 i crafted 5 arm and scrapped and got nothing   
---
No, but it is tied to damage. So a rifle that does 100 damage per shot takes more AP points than a pistol that does 50 dmg.
---
Ima have to figure out later tonight I guess
---
I bet I have 100-150 hours into FO76. The thing I keep seeing people say is "if you don't like it, why did you play it so much?" Well, thing is that only 15% of that time was actually enjoyment, the rest of the time was *wanting* to be entertained, searching for the fun, trying to make the best out of a bad situation, and looking for ways to squeeze my money's worth out of a shallow game. In retrospect I should have given up sooner.
---
That's a great idea actually, most people agree that selling ammo for a cap per bullet would be bad all around plus it would also be great for player trading. It would fit well considering the bulk resources. Wish there was a way to throw your comment to Bethesda directly. 
---
Yup, what siftingflour said - 40 US dollars.
---
i have found if i keep holding the grenade button that it seems to cancel after 15 seconds. this has happened for me when i took my sweet time to throw it, also happened because i was in a vulnerable situation and kept holding it but when i finally released the button nothing happened.
---
&gt; I'm guessing that there is no way to separate a chat ability 
---
You'd guess wrong
---
Or the Blackwater Rifle from Point Lookout. It wasn't quite as good as the Lincoln Repeater, but still great and with more plentiful ammo.
---
They have all the Nuka Cola flavours from Nuka World for the faithful who find them. Except the mixed ones, they don't have those. 
---
You can acquire paints for bats just by scrapping them. There are several including one that requires aluminum 
---
Don't ask.. I think I hit 100 hours on the Bug report process this week..   
---
What am I seeing, just a black wall?  
---
Never apologize for trying to help, yourself and everyone else, and with now SEVEN pages of bugs, it would be easy to overlook one already submitted 
---
260
---
Literally every single Inside the Vault?
---
I swear to god, you must be 14 or else this is honestly pathetic. 
---
I’m not sure it works on any Power Armors.  May check myself but not looking forward to the costs.  
---
People have left the game. Most of those people were higher level ones too so we've lost individuals that would have frequently launched them. Also the playerbase has completely killed the market making farming kind of redundant
---
I didn’t know—thank you.  
---
does the site that was pumping out launch codes still exist? if not maybe the lack of everyone being spoon fed launch codes is a cause.
---
Yeah, I used to accept random team invites to help other people fast travel, but then two players used the group to go to my camp and attack it. Not much of a setback, but it's not something I'm interested in doing anymore. 
---
It'll be my 3am. Yeah, I'll do something tomorrow or on the weekend.
---
I love the "Kill, Laugh, Love" sign! It's EPIC! 
---
Yesterday when I was teaming up with another prayer after a while I could not see them at all no matter what they did they were invisible to me then when I went to go protect my Poseidon energy I blue screen on arrival
---
&gt; Honestly it's true when they say that a bad game will remain a bad game forever. Even when you talk about NMS now, the vast majority of the people still remember it for the huge disaster it was,
---
I'd say The Division and FFXIV both managed to turn around.
---
My current camp is set up for Lead collection with no water around.  My Husband's camp is in the water collecting Acid.  
---
Less people playing because they're fed up with Beth  and either quit for good or are waiting for the fix Beth promised that'll never happen.  
---
My entire team just got one-shotted by a fucker using duped bobbleheads who used a power fist. We all had passive mode on and full health, etc. 
---
Before the TSE nerf, I could stand still with 3 people shooting TSE 50s and mini guns and it would still take 2-3 minutes to get me to low health. Then this guy pulls this shit and is about to make my friends quit for good. They're low levels and I've been helping them out, but that's twice now that assholes have pulled shit and griefed us and we're tired of it, especially when they're using exploits
---
It exists. Just used it last night
---
My hints.
---
Boobleheads - absolute top of poseidonpowerplant
---
-or raider camp on west of top of the world have 3 spawns of it
---
Beer hat - under vault 76 is lumberjack behind it is road on which is gray bus having it
---
Magazines - my spot is on table in corner of watoga behind phonix's shop
---
If there is any critecs challenge (chicken/rabit/...) I go to that lumberjack under vault. There is lake at which is spawn of there creatures, server hop until u get "right one".
---
For cryptids in canal next to poseidon powerplant is guatanted spawn of 10lvl grafton monster
---
For animals there are 5 those ugly mutated dogs at isolated kabins near vault 76.
---
Gnome is in phoenix shop watoga / in little shack next ro red rocket in flatwoods
---
Felitizer is in green houses behind vaultec in flatwoods
---
If you dont know some ask i may know everything about challenges lol
---
Pay to not slow walk.  Or they could just increase stash size. 
---
This is my list _(all pre patch 5)_
---
I was focusing on armor, and was tallying how many server hops per location and per plan.
---

---
I would be a liar if I said I haven't grabbed someone else's bag. That said, I would be absolutely thrilled to see a message saying someone is coming to get their stuff back. It would make drop whatever I was currently doing and run!
---
I'm still trying to figure out why they leave bags open to be taken outside of PVP. 
---
Them offering it and doing it doesn't make us entitled to them doing it. The Inside the Vaults and Community engagement is just Marketing/PR to keep those who are interested in the game... interested, willing to buy if they haven't already, to spend in the Atom store, etc. I think you are confusing the actions Beth voluntary takes to make the game better with actions they have to take. They could (at their own peril) offer no further support and that would be that.
---
A couple days ago someone suggested starting new characters and running from the vault to do the first two responder quests in Flatwoods since those can drop it. Delete the character and repeat if you don't get it. They said it takes about 10 minutes per run.
---
Interesting he mentioned that the Whitesprings robots are initially hostile to you until you get a keycard or something.  I've never had the Whitesprings robots be hostile to me unless I've hit one.
---
I think I might’ve seen a single Antibiotic in the entire time I’ve been playing the game—maybe two. Mostly I just wait it out or use/make a Disease Cure.
---
Tomorrow is Valentines Day... why would it be a joke.
---
I don't want to spend hours just to get my camp back the way it is. Also don't feel like having to delete all the crap that duplicates when camp is moved, some of us build to the environment rather than the popular single foundation with stairs that can be placed anywhere. 
---
For someone who nit picks over details you sure missed the fact I never claimed it would remove dust. Go back and read it again skippy and you realize fix-all-things - asked how does boiling it remove radioactive dust. I on the other hand just explained how a basic water boiling system works.  Swing and a miss there mate try again.
---
Anyone know if Combat dense mod still spawns 
---
Beer hat often spawns next to the Harpers Ferry vendor too. 
---
They patched bobble heads. They don’t stack. He was probably running Bloodied where you can get those melee weapons damage ramped through the roof. 
---
It is their first MMO, they worked on Doom Multiplayer and 76 is their first full released game.
---
TSE def needed a nerf, but I feel like they should have just nerfed those specific mods when they were on same weapon and left everything else alone.
---
Because it's a simulation 
---
I was wanted hiding in my camp be hunted by a player. I killed him and he was seeking revenge and we went at it a few minutes, his tactics were def hurtin me and our loadouts seem to do mixed damage with some varied results. I killed him 3 to 4 times before they got tired of losing 90 caps per death. We friends now so I'm sure I'm gonna fight em again n test out dif tactics chemed n loadouts but it seemed pretty fair and decently balanced between us atleast. I totally recommend gaining a wanted level n hiding in a camp setup for pvp(double doors and security doors and such) and letting the pvp begin!!
---
He had full health. Bloodied wouldn't have had any legendary effect if he was at full health.
---
I was cleaning out my stash box and took out all my junk. I had a smattering of unscrapped items so, it was just easier... plus, I needed to sell stuff and didn't want to keep digging back in the box. Bethesda, I hate you. GIVE ME ALL THE PLASTIC!
---
never used it (havent tried to launch a nuke yet) so I havent kept track.
---
They are certainly bugs
---
Will they be addressing weapon dissapearing in the next patch?
---
There are no nukes because the SBQ drops crap and you can get Ultracite off a terminal and they nerfed the legendary drops at Whitespring. 
---
The answer?  Red Dead Redemption 2.  
---
Have it scrap into whatever components are used to create it, like lead/steel/crystal for cryo cells, copper/lead/plastic for fusion cells, etc...
---
I found a plan somewhere to make Antibiotic
---
yeah they also have several distilleries and other forms of water purifiers around as well that obviously can be interacted with because they are meant to be in the game not to mention the green houses and such.
---
It wont help after a couple shots when their roads jump past any health potential they had
---
Yes... they could. But I don't think you understand how marketing/PR work, as has already been pointed out. 
---
Sometimes the diseased tag overwrites the legendary tag so it looks like the enemy isn't legendary but it really is.
---
 Here's how to get there:
---
3. Once you're through the tennis court, turn right. Then walk 20-30 feet.
---
4. Look to your left. You'll see a circular stone gazebo looking thing with a bunch of bushes around it (about 20-30 feet away).
---
5. Go there and drop down into the gazebo. Look for a drinking fountain that says Sulphur Drinking Fountain. Drink. Free disease cure forever! I really never need disease cure anymore. Just stop by there while I'm running around.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Can't help but giggle at a BBSCB!
---
What level are you? I can run a nuke with you today and knock out a few quests and achievements all at once.
---
they serve very different purposes. damage reduction is generally better than damage resistance but dodgy requires minmaxing to shine. max agi, lone wanderer 3, action boy/girl 3, etc.
---
Ya I jus figured out an easy way to fight ppl it takes time but it works
---
You're missing the actual point as I've had to state multiple times. It is not about me losing my stuff. It's about a possible new mechanic to loot bags and pvp. The only reason I see not to have it is people want to take bags consequence free. You'd get your chance to get your stuff back I get my chance to get my stuff back.
---
Disease cure is better 100% cure rate vs antibiotics which only have 50% chance
---
Damn I can't believe some people are still willing to play this pile o shite game. It's people like you that make Bethesda keep bringing out crap! Do yourself and The Gaming Community a favour and stop supporting Bethesda and maybe they'll bring a better games.
---
Before doom and 76 they worked on a microtransaction heavy game that got put on hold. They had no experience doing anything like 76 before. I'm not insulting them. I'm just stating the obvious. Their current staff cannot handle it at all. They either need help of need more/better employees. 
---
The ammo and med vending machines have the sell button on the screen it when your interact already they would just need to be activated.  It would make using the ammo vending machine worth while, the last ten times I checked them there was nothin I could use.  Well except the bulk screws, which I thought was fixed in a patch 
---
Then it was AA. They ignore your armor and can also get their build values high  Melee is the new/old OP. 
---
I guess there's the rest of the album:

You'll be able to find more builds on reddit in posts I authored, but the Mire Bunker (yes it has an underground bunker) is clearly my favorite. 
---
Not in your stash though
---
Well the best value I ever got out of a video game (as per a single run) was Fallout 4 Game of the Year Addition. It costed me 40 bucks at Christmas Eve (granted I know the game is older, but all DLC makes that a pretty good deal). I finished it on the weekend, I logged 225 hours - and I will pick it up again, just bought Fallout 3 and I want to beat that now.
---
\------
---
20 hours does seem a bit short of a game, I think South Park the Stick of Truth was the shortest game I ever beat at around 12 hours. However, I can beat any of the Mass Effect games in about 30 hours - the fact I've replayed the trilogy over three times still means the dollars spent/hours played is quite good still. 
---
I guess it depends, a 20 hour game might be good on the premise that you can replay it multiple times. 
---
Honestly I might be done for a while. This kind of shitty performance has been the norm, not the acceptation for me as yet. 
---
I am not sure how many hours I have in the game, but I am at level 113. It hasn't been problem free gaming, but I am sure having fun.
---
Thumbs up.
---
u/Ladydevann Have you found out anything about this yet? Saw you comment this on a couple posts last week, but havent seen a follow up
---
There's a vendor that sells it. Won't say where. Spoilers.
---
But pharma farma perk card and searching medical containers helps. I have like 35 disease cures right now.
---
Tbh tho. They can just run there course without effecting u too much 
---
Still doesn't add up. One hit knocked ALL of my HP and we were both out of combat with each other. It completely ignored passive mode
---
Use Pharma Finder perk.  Go to Morgantown Airport.  Use the SEARCH button on every white med container, yellow chem container, blue chem container, doctor bag, and bathroom mirror you find.  Head to Whitesprings next and do the same thing.
---
You'll have plenty of antibiotics and disease cure in no time.
---
Except for Ignition Cores on the Mount Blaire Quest. Those scrap in "scrap all." 
---
Mid to late 50's...not a number I really filed way since lvls dont matter after 50. but I havent even been to blackwells bunker and only recently started belly of the beast. I am still far and away from launching a nuke.
---
When does that part happen?
---
I appreciate that you took the time to take your couch outside to view it.
---
This is the true endgame in fo76
---
I've noticed that effect as I walk through the spot where the pile was.  I assumed it's just a "getting close - object looks bigger" effect.
---
Agree. Meanwhile, you can't (AFAIK) rename power armor frames. I always have to take all my frames out of my stash in order to figure out which is my X01, which is my excavator, which is my T60, etc. Or maybe, on the inventory menu, enable the picture of the PA frame to actually show the armor that's on the frame! I swear, it's death by 1,000 cuts with this game, most of them related to inventory. 
---
Yeah, I'm on PS4. Didn't know that about the digs. Oh, well. Was just doing the side quest to build up rank to fight the dumbass Wendingo in the cave...
---
Head for WA-TOE-GA! (Read with the soothing voice of a vendor bot)
---
i used to see WS nuked all the time..that has went down..i usually see at least one or two per play period..im always looking for them..then i noticed a bunch are at fissure site because of SBQ..fighter her is kind of meh..but i like to go there for the violet flux &lt;3&lt;3
---
**also ive been noticing lately ppl have been nuking harpers ferry? i went..there were a few glowing ones but i dont really see the benefit of it
---
/u/Ladydevann and /u/LoneVaultWanderer and /u/Valseek and /u/FurySevenSix and /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ maybe it will get one of their attention......
---
Thank you! 
---
I had a buddy with an AA powerfist with swing speed destroy my health in a few hits in Power Armor. No bobble heads or chems. I was is Pacifist too. We were just screwing around, but it’s possible without any exploits. 
---
I thought the mutations we get in game were already caused by FEV virus? I mean radiation triggers it and its pretty much in all the water supply so you drink it and boom marsupial.
---
Oh wow. Yeah once you get the enclave missions done you should call one on whitespring or fissure prime. Excellent hits
---
It's a combination of two factors:
---
The legendary drops you get are pretty garbage.  90-95% of the stuff I get I can't use and isn't worth trading on the trading reddits (and I've tried to sell some of this crap).
---
There are fewer and fewer people playing the game as people get bored with the lack of CONTENT.
---
You'll see more nukes if a content patch drops.  Until then, you'll have to drop them yourself.
---
p.s.  They should also sprinkle some legendary enemies into the nuke bunker.  You spend tons of ammo and repair materials and time to drop nukes, only to get almost nothing prior to the actual nuke hitting.
---
Not really no, words mean more than their original definition. Look at the sentence I quoted, it's is pathetic endorsement for a company that has show us that they do not deserve it.
---
I’ll let some run their course, Buzz Brain for example. I think I mostly just don’t like having that red icon at the bottom of the screen...
---
Thanks for putting all of these together!
---
&gt;There are no nukes because the SBQ drops crap and you can get Ultracite off a terminal and they nerfed the legendary drops at Whitespring.
---
I never really got much out of farming a nuked white spring to begin with.  The main thing I was looking for was calibrated shocks for the ultracite power armor.   These can be crafted from a plan that is only dropped by the queen. 
---
Except she basically never drops them. 
---
I've gotten 30 plans for explosive vents instead. 
---
So I just said to hell with it. 
---
One reason to launch nukes is to farm flux, which are used to build mods. But those mods are impossible to obtain thanks to RNG.
---
So there is literally no point.   
---
I do but I cant find enough ppl to hunt/fight
---
If you find the Fusion Generator plan, please post a reply of where you found it and what level you are.  I am certain I saw it on multiple vendors in the past on higher level characters (Camden, Lewisburg, Welch, Harpers Ferry, and Watoga.)  However, on my level 25, I haven't seen them anywhere yet.  There may be a min level requirement.
---
"A few hits" is far different from one hit.  This was retardedly bad
---
I tried putting the Old Possum beer sign in a friend's camp, but it didn't even show up in the build menu. On XB.
---
&gt; Thanks for reading this far, and while you’re at it, take a moment to head to the Atomic Shop.
---
I laughed silently.
---
I think this is a great idea. If you jack someones bag on death, be prepared to fight to keep it.

Great tip, I will have to try this!
---
I want my guns and armor skins , not hello kitty, Matte black , chrome, what the other guy said about energy weapons having some glowing blue or green parts. Solid colors for power armor, and regular armor. And a bigger meaner beard!
---
were you the guy in the clown mask with a drill running around in your undies last Saturday.....
---
Berserker is probably going to be the new meta once/if they patch bloodied.
---
it's not as good, but it's better than ts.
---
I have not noticed this, pretty sure it’s not true.
---
My point is and has always been that the entitlement at which a lot of people have in regards to this game is out of control. As an adult who can think like an adult, I can understand the situation. I can acknowledge that I'd like the game to be better but I have no entitlement to it and I'm not going to act like a child, pout and throw a temper tantrum about the game.
---
For all the “just go to a water source it’s faster” posts.
---
Where is the place with the shortest distance between a water source, cooking station, and stash box?
---
A place where I can be over encumbered with dirty water walk the shortest distance to an in game cooking station to boil it, and if still over encumbered the shortest walk to a stash box.
---
Wow there partner! You really expect me to watch all that hog wash?
---
all that stuff is good:
---
* stabilize flux/craft serums
---
* worth a lot..u can clean out vendors selling all of them
---
Nope just the excavator power armor.
---
The Level of rage I got from bioshock infinite for its low play time made me hate on it and I got it on sale where as I get this game and not only already got my moneys worth but they are giving me more free content? I mean err how uhh terrible is this game right...... quickly to the topics that have nothing to do with gameplay uhhh so how about that rum....
---
Board Game Geek. And they're actually friendly. Their down votes don't show a total though.
---
Medical area of a certain place sells the recipe for antibiotics. In fact I think I have a spare. But pharma farma is really good for turning up disease cures. For me lol 😂 
---
Nuke material the rail yard by the excavator. Fiber optics ? No clue as no use for it. I have over 1k in bulk what is it used for !!
---
That’s very true. I did think of that as well, but it can be hard to look and avoid dying. Lol. So it’s totally possible they were sneaking/hidden and I just didn’t see them. I do agree it happens every time someone enters the area everything respawns though. 
---
Definitely good to know thanks!
---
I saw something about psychotats and bobble heads but cannot confirm if they stack or if you can stack psychotats one on top of the other. 
---
Its probably the garbage creation engine not being able to comprehend simple tasks like this.  I don't ever see them fixing this.  My guess is that they'd probably have to make 2 separate ingredients for boiled and purified water if they wanted to fix this. 
---
**It just works.**
---
Both sound fun but no one plays hunter/hunted which blows. I been messin with the pvp and wanted system and it's fun even with fallouts padded pvp bs. So I'm lookin forward to survival mode for real! 
---
Not really, just a troll, but enjoy being that douchebag that goes through people's Post history who everybody hates.
---
It's weird, though, that the Race Car Bed has yet to instill the kind of hatred the Castle Bed has. 
---
Both are silly and out of place, but only the pink one has some folks worked up.
---
kind of explains why I keep finding tatos in vault tech boxes from fallout 4.... obviously someone from 76 put it there after taking the stimpacks
---
machete or fire axe, 10mm auto pistol, and the 38 auto pipe rifle were my goto's at that level.  Mainly the machete.  Hunting/sniper rifle for mutants at a distance, fire ax up close.
---
The airport....not the mutant one, the scorched one - theres a supply drop event at the airport...and a workshop at grafton steel.  
---
repeat runs through both were good for lots of XP - generally L6 scorched at the airport and mostly L5 mutants (couple of 10s) at grafton steel.  Going inside Grafton steel will give you higher level mutants (IIRC, theres more than one L16 in there).
---
  Careful if you try to cross the nearly dam using a melee weapon - you'll likely be quadruple teamed by mutants while crossing ...and die a lot.  
---
But if you can make it, theres a nice payoff in the building inside the fenced area.
---
Bonus: The mutant airport has a PA chassis in one of the hangars on the far side (opposite the terminal building)
---
I know for sure that Graham doesn't always have the mirror ball. It's still RNG.
---
Then don't keep it in your stash 
---
Dodgy can be more trouble than its worth. It can wipe out your AP if you take more than a few hits and don't have a whole lot of AP. Dodgy is great against single enemy melee or slow firing single enemy. Fast firing weapons and multiple enemies hitting you is gonna be a big issue leaving you with pretty much no AP. So it cann be good but also a hindrance.
---
For \*some\* reason, the purple lamp for T51 gives the Atom Store icon.  I always know which it is, now.  
---
That's the only advice I've got
---
lol yeah. didnt hurt that I expected to be playing solo and thought of nuking as multiplayer. so it wasnt my aim as I played.
---
I've also heard the area around the power plant and town north of top of the world (mohanga or how ever it is spelt) is a good point to drop for as well. 
---
There are some very clever, very devoted people at Bethesda, or this game and its predecessors in the Fallout franchise wouldn't have the appeal they do.
---
There are also some absolutely stupid and uncaring people at Bethesda who can't/won't bring any empathy to the game, who don't play it themselves, and who aren't bright enough to figure out that in the long run, their only goal — getting a paycheck that doesn't bounce — would actually be better served by trying to emulate their clever &amp; devoted colleagues.
---
The person *in charge* of the coder who plugged these names in is one of the ones just thinking (shortsightedly at that) about the paycheck, and not one whit about you or me.
---
Probably your camp with a pump placed right next to your stash and cooking station, I find it works great using this workaround... other than that I've only had my camp in one spot ever so I'm not sure!
---
It's nice in the vault with no one around to bother you! Unlimited nachos and holotapes. Sleep in any bed you like. Coming up with creative ways to pop balloons. Reprogram the Mister Handy's for alternative uses. It's a paradise in there.
---
Some dudes just can't deal with the color pink at all, for some reason.
---
•I've been waiting on the inevitable Pink Pip-Boy skin, which i got already.
---
•Weapon Skins that are universal or maybe just for certain categories.
---
I don't know what else, i haven't really put much thought into it.
---
Upvoted the moment I saw "Prey" in your comment. 
---
Do any of you have reactive armor or the mutations that trigger in melee?  Those can switch you out of passive since you “responded “ to the attack?
---
Yeah. I just took some big "Dumps" in a train station.
---
They should let us bulk ammo then scrap it based off the number of ammo you get by crafting
---
Example - you make 100 .50 cal ammo so you bulk it in .50 and get back 40% of the materials you would used to craft it to compensate for ammo crafting perks (180% ammo craft + super duper) 
---
also all ammo should be sold as bulk instead of 1 bullet at a time 
---
and we should get some kind of cheap surplus bullet that greatly reduces gun condition 
---
Wild guess as the "big twist" in 76? It's probably Ultracite though I I'm on the same page as you.
---
Nope. I use +1S with motion-assist torso
---
If you aren't seeing ANY logins (as you should have already promoted yourself and such using Natasha's login) then there is definitely something wrong.  Have you dropped or stashed any of the other holotapes?  I kept all of them in my inventory when going through the story, so not sure if it might be tied to having them on you.
---
If that doesn't work, then your only hope is to get Bethesda to fix that character.....I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!  You can also start an alt just for that quest......you can easily complete it well before you can use any of the equipment you build.....I started it on my latest alt at around lvl 15, and had completed it before lvl 20.  Had to wait 5 more levels before I could use any of the items I'd gotten/made.
---
Minor Spoiler: There is a safe in watoga with 8 stimpacks that sometimes has 3 antibiotics as well. Bigger Spoiler: The safe you get for completing the Mayor for the Day quest.

I made mine a CILF since I have to look at it so frequently

If you are impressed with Fallout 76, you should look into MMOs as oppose single player games.
---
Fightin other players is fun but usually theres only a cap reward as most ppl store junk constantly. And this sub is a small part of the players and I'm sure alot of them are askin for better pvp or it wouldnt be happening really. 
---
[They're not a billion](https://incfact.com/company/zenimaxmedia-rockville-md/). That's Zenimax at large, too. Then you have to think how much of that is currently absorbed by current contracts and salaries and if there's a "rainy day fund" or what other investments they have already planned.
---
inb4 silenced by the suits for spoiling "the grand scheme"
---
tbh this crap annoys me most, fallout 4 already had these things they are mostly reselling and they have the audacity to charge PER skin at FULL pricing, i mean full pricing is kinda meh anyways but at least you were getting 4 different armors or 4-7 weapon skins in one bundle even if they were slightly tacky ones.

Yep, costs are high.  I generally don't try with mine. I only pull out the pa for nuked zones, so modding my regular armor has been my grind.

Im gonna have to go look now lol.

He might have spawned with it and sold out before you found him.

I do NOT want to play PVP. Why is there not an option for those of us that just want normal Fallout?

They're not listening.

What about teammates (assuming you were teamed). I have been killed because a teammate was not in passive mode.

So that's how you tag people? Unfortunately I'm relatively new here so I'm not sure how certain things work. /u/Ladydevann /u/LoneVaultWanderer /u/Valseek /u/FurySevenSix /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ if anyone of you can acknowledge this I truly believe this would be a very beneficial option, as stated being able to bulk ammo for sale/trade/scrapping would improve many aspects of ammo usability. Much of the community wants something different with the ammo and I feel this is a very constructive approach to solve a couple lingering issues.

I mean the calibrated shocks for the excavator are in Camden Park. They're about 5k.

He has instanced loot for sure. My friends and I have all hopped him dozens of times for perpetually changing loot tables.

They were all in passive. Everyone in power armor, no reactive plates or mutations.

I took a picture of your Perk card setup so I can work on mine, compare. Can we move those Perk cards around or is it set in stone? My perk cards go from high strength down to luck as far as number wise. Also how are you guys jumping so high? lol I'm level 43, does the jumping higher get better as you level up?  I see some guys like they have anti-gravity suits on, team fortress back in the day ;)

Substitute X for whatever you're looking for.  There are a lot of reddit posts and articles.  Works 95% of the time unless you're looking for something exceedingly rare (shielded armor plans, certain rare outfits, etc).
---
Currently about halfway into it. It’s amazing to me how much stuff people just accept as part of the game. I put about 30 hours in on Christmas break at my brother in law’s house and had many of the same issues. A good video even if you like 76.
---
I only farm for raw flux to sell for caps. Tired of the ammo sponge that is the SBQ and wood armor. 
---
I mean every time the game lags and you shift somewhere that has to be on Bethesda and not your shitty WiFi right? Please sub to me on YouTube to see all my original content such as “ea bad” “fallout 76 glitch” and “fortnite”
---
Platform? 
---
not even something worth bragging about
---
20 hours isn’t even a lot for a single player game. Look at the Witcher, assassins creed origins/odyssey, Skyrim and other big single player games.
---
They have at least 100 hours of content.

Thanks, appreciate it. So.. dumb question please - how did you remove your interface from the vid, is there a menu option I've missed?
---
Yes! Thank you for the tag I mistakingly thought I responded to this. So it is a bug and they are currently investigating it, I am not sure what patch it will be fixed in just in yet. 
---
I agree it needed nerfing. But they nerfed it so damn much my build was rendered useless. Strangely, the weapons are still strong-ish, but I stopped playing when I killed a crciket after 9 shots....NINE SHOTS to kill a fucking cricket...with a shotgun...at close range...that explodes..........
---
Not only that, you cant stack explosive bobbleheads anymore, I didnt do that anyway, but the fact that you can still stack melee bobbleheads annoys the shit out of me.
---
Balancing weapons does not mean you virtually eliminate a build while leaving others OP.
---
Took a break a few months ago, little sad to see nothing has changed
---
&gt;I would be a liar if I said I haven't grabbed someone else's bag. That said, I would be absolutely thrilled to see a message saying someone is coming to get their stuff back. It would make drop whatever I was currently doing and run!
---
So you've stolen other players' loot bags? And if they knew it was you you'd run?
---
[Hmm.](https://i.gifer.com/VtXa.gif)
---
Just a heads up, it doesn't need to be directly over the water stream. You can just hit drink then spam collect to the same effect. Also if you have a friend you fan just both spam collect and it will work. It works much quicker with a friend as you don't have to drink again after every few seconds to trigger the animation.
---
This, and the 10mm auto pistol and the pipe revolver.  Both are plentiful in ammunition finds (10mm and .45) both are pretty easy to find in The Forest, and aren't too heavy to cart around to the next crafting station.  You'll end up scrapping LOTS of them to get the suppressors, usually anyway.
---
10mm pistol with Powerful Auto receiver, perforating magazine, and suppressor.
---
Pipe Revolver with Hardened Receiver, and suppressor.
---
Hunting Rifle with Hardened Receiver, perforating magazine, Long Recon/NV Scope, and suppressor.
---
Yes I couldn't agree more.  I'm sure it's not for everyone, but it has really made the game fun again. 
---
Because you don't understand the meaning of a word doesn't mean that is suddenly a new definition for it. 
---
Is that really the only argument you have at this point? That people are acting too entitled?
---
This game was released three months before it ever should have been, that is undeniable fact. This was not a AAA standard release, and saying anything otherwise is factually incorrect. 
---
So yes, people that paid for a AAA release, and received a beta game ARE entitled to what they paid for. 
---
What IS your point anyway? You're just here to defend Bethesda for shipping the biggest disappointment of 2018? Do you not want the game to get any better? If it wasn't for the extensive feedback, there would be no updates to this game. Do you think everyone should just sit back and accept that $80 no longer buys a complete game? Should they stand for companies that release objectively terrible and unfinished games?
---
Just stop and think for a second that you're actively encouraging people to stop providing feedback. 
---

But my vendor character is a female and I made her look all pretty and shit because sex sells....

Eh, even then big guns get shafted, to the tune of probably needing a damage increase of 300% or more.
---
The LMG is currently about 15-18 base I think, which should be 70-80 easy.

A lot of rebalance needs to happen here tbh.

Hmmm. Then there is a new exploit.  I am guessing chems  I do know if I have Radworms now I am one hitting everything.  Maybe you get Radworms and pop some chems.  Just spit ballin’

I wonder why that area is so bad with latency...
---
strangely for me the bat kinda disappeared.  he swooped in twice while hammering me w his sonic blasts.  i finished off my bots and i waited for him to swoop back but it was nowhere to be found.  i looked down and i couldnt even see a corpse.  i wondered if the bat is scripted to swoop in few times and go away.  maybe i was just lucky.
---
I actually found his review more positive then most.
---
Who, given the choice, would ever choose:
---
Oh yeah! Put me on that server where all the time and trouble I've invested in choosing my CAMPsite will be wasted?
---
Yeah I did too back after I posted this, ended up gifting the set to my friend when he hit the level requirement. Fun armor to use though! 
---
No, wrong and disingenuous as well. Words have more than one definition, and that should readily apparent to just about anyone. 
---
I had friends who played this game... once upon a time... but this is new info to me and thanks for your contribution!
---
Oh. No. I messed up. I'll kill myself now. 
---
A couple of days ago, I came across a level 6 player under attack by several robots so I sniped them for him from a great distance away.  I'm playing solo and I just walked away afterwards.  The guy ran up behind me then started circling around me.  I just ignored him.  The next thing I know, he's shooting me in the back.  I ignored him and walked on . . . he kept after me for five minutes before finally giving up.  I like helping other players but don't appreciate some of their needs for acknowledgement.
---
I could be wrong but as far as I know....Disease Cures heal one disease per disease cure. While Antibiotics heal all diseases, at the time of consuming, active per one antibiotic use.
---
Your best bet is to wait until the end of the month, when we’re scheduled to get a new patch (we don’t know the full changelog for that yet) and the roadmap for the year.
---
Personally I recommend it, this isn’t too accommodating to late game players right now but the game in general is quite fun.
---
Mine is a fat guy with a green combover and a pornstache. 
---
Looked awesome in the rocketgirl costume until they screwed that up.
---
It could be tied to weight, but my Gauss rifle only takes 4 shots to drain my AP, and my handmade takes 11. 
---
The problem is that by not saving this game they're really hurting the chances people buy the next game. If they sunk resources into 76 and assured the playerbase that even when they fuck up they take the time to fix it, that would make me more likely to buy Starfield/other Bethesda games.
---
I see thanks for clarifying that. I misread that since lvl1. Lol
---
If you server hop your workshops are gone!
---
*Precisely*. This is another way of saying: "I'm a player who values this aspect of the game."
---
If you don't give a crap about your CAMP and you've made no investment of thought, time, effort, and/or ATOMs on it, then it's no big deal at all to be plopped down on a server with no CAMP.
---
If you do care — and indeed, in *direct proportion* to how much you do care — this this is a giant PITA.
---
HELL YEAH IT IS MY DUDE. Use it before going out with friends in game, and when ur on an adventure, as the charisma benefits from being with friends, and luck is good for crit shots during missions.
---
I made mine look like joseph seed
---
I think you do take rad damage, but I've never noticed because the rads of a glowing blood pack is tiny compared to the background rads of a nuked zone, even in power armor. 
---
I am just waiting for Anthem at this point. Hopefully fallout can draw me back in, but there is nothing left for me to do in the game. Collecting water, food, and supplies for repairing armor and weapons only entertains for so long....
---
yup.  better than losing caps.
---
50% over base damage.  Build a Handmade and if it does 100 damage.  Buy a Handmade with Berserker and it does 150. 
---
My favorite weapon right now is Berserker Explosive Handmade. :)
---
I dont believe mods for the X01 exist in the game. You either acquire them in a trade from another player (thats how I got the Calibrated Shocks and Tesla Coils that I use) or you go to the Armory Vendor in the Whitesprings Bunker and hope for the best (thats how I landed the Jet Pack I will probably never use)
---

Well if you change your mind, each shock takes 5 violet flux, 17 aluminum, 17 fiberglass and 17 adhesive.

well, i got plenty of great perks that require a team.  also, i get bored with lonewolf now and then.  remember young one, nothing is absolute.
---
Oh goodness yes, planters please.
---
Don't get me started on this piece of writing buffoonery.
---
Legit. Everything I have read says to stay in doors for 7 days. After that, the fallout isn't that bad. The dust in the water will eventually break down.
---
I really want an Instigating/Furious weapon.  If the first hit doesn't kill them each consecutive hit will be doing more and more damage.
---
Can you tell if there's any way to raise those chances?
---
After having air drops land inside rock outcrops and in fissures, I've giving up on them.  The last couple of reachable ones had good items like "golf tee" and "dirty water."  I can find that kind of stuff without all the grief.
---
Of course I understand that words have multiple meanings. And, just to be sure, looked it up in several dictionaries (Webster's, Urban, ect)  
---
None of them say anything about being a corporate shill- like at all. 
---
It basically comes down to: a spineless man or one who likes to watch his wife have sex with another man, or a combination of both
---
Again, just because you misuse a word doesnt mean that is a correct definition of said word. No matter how often you use it improperly. 
---
Not everyone does, but I do. And I don't look like my character IRL. So to you OP, do you look like your ugly toon? Might need a camparo here, side by side pic : ) 
---
VERY strong. Need more of this.  Just the facts, tickets submitted, no drama.   
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Furious = Faster Swing / Faster Firing Weapons
---
Instigating = High Damage Weapons
---
Bloody = Low Health Character Builds
---
Two Shot = Kinda a middle road between all the weapons.  Will always prox on hit, doesn't need to scale.
---
Anti-Armor = Better against higher armor enemies (SBQ, scorchbeasts, mirelurk queen, bohemeoth, etc)
---
Those are the primary useful ones.  There are some marginal / situational ones like Vampire.  There are some worthless ones like Suppressor.
---
Examples:
---
\- A Furious super sledge isn't that great because it's a very slow swing weapon so it takes a while to build up max damage per hit.
---
\- A instigating submachine gun isn't that great because only the FIRST bullet does double damage, and not much double damage at that.
---
\- A Anti-Armor gun doesn't do anything more to low armor enemies that die quickly anyways.
---
For second and third perks look at things that will DIRECTLY enhance the damage or usefulness of the weapon.
---
Super Sledge / Bloody / Swing Speed 40% / 90% Reduced Weight = hits hard with bloody build, swings faster for more hits, and reduced weight helps because it's a very heavy weapon.
---
Dragon / Instigating / Faster Reload / + Damage Resist while Reloading = Double damage on high damage weapons is great, it's a VERY slow reload weapon so reload speed helps, and because it's very slow reloading damage resist while reloading is good.
---
You just have to look at each perk logically and say "does that help this weapon / build, or is it worthless"
---
I wanted to make a short, fat guy for my melee character only to find out I can't change the height.
---
Honestly, if they did implement something, I just hope they do something to differentiate dropped loot, abandoned bags and bags people are coming to retrieve. People don't always come back for their bags, and often drop a bunch of crap legendaries mid-event. ~\o/~
---
Yes. fair is fair.  Notice how I also said I would be thrilled to see someone trying to get retribution.  In the situation I'm talking about (in a nuke zone) fast travel is near impossible because there are almost always enemies around you. I would have to run the distance to a stash giving the other player a chance to kill me even closer to a stash claiming their junk AND mine and getting it to the stash before I could re seek justice. 
---
They’re in magazines that randomly spawn. Unfortunately there’s no reliable source. 
---
Being a super mutant works in fo76 because there is no dialogue 
---
Like a lot of people, I was so damn excited for this game and now I can't really find a reason to play. I haven't even explored all of the map or finished the story. I'm just kind of bored with it. Seems like I spend more time selling my stuff off to make room because my stash and personal inventory is always full. Feels more like a chore simulator than a post apocalyptic survival game. 
---
 I'm hoping they release a big update that will breathe some life back into it because I wholeheartedly love Fallout and really want to see this game succeed but damn if this hasn't been one of the most rockiest starts to a game I've seen. 
---
Sorry, not sure on timeline, it was near the same time... going to say before
---
Really appreciate people who make these lists. Has anyone found a vendor selling deep pocketed trapper chest/limb plans? 
---
nowadays i log in - see no events up or like freakin messenger and mama dolces feed the people.  I go days without seeing enclave/horde and uranium fever was up ONCE yesterday.  
---
I got a level 25 drop from it.  Just awesome.  Why is this how i spend my free time?  Gonna be depressed when crackdown 3 is garbage too huh :(
---
*Furious is stacking damage after each consecutive hit, not faster firing
---
;)
---
I understand if you like the game. But pretending it’s all on some WiFi lag is just shortsighted and doesn’t help your point. Like it’s not even an argument it’s just playground insults basically. Watch the video before just being argumentative 
---
I don't know about "races", but being able to get turned into a Supermutant would be a cool addition... as long as it's not random like mutations. There is that one facility with all the Green stuff that could have a quest to get mutated. 
---
If what is most important to you is the $ per hour then sure that's a lot more spent on entertainment. There are plenty of movies I saw in the theater which I remember more and think were a better time than games I played for 50 or so hours. Dark Knight, Avatar, LOTR. I do not strictly believe that longer equals better or shorter means it is worse. This applies to games, movies, shows, and books. Now if something is really good it sure doesn't hurt when its is also lengthy but not at the cost of it becoming repetitive and stale. 
---
Dead Space 1/2 and Resident Evil 4 would be some games less than 20 hours long which I still to this day remember and think about replaying. I played some MMOs for way longer which I never want to touch again.   
---
Coming to an Atomic Shop near you!
---
I have a furious lever action. Makes head shot strings interesting, but I don't know for sure the stacking damage. I've heard it's 5% or 15% up to a maximum of 50% base, but not something I've tested extensively.
---
So you picked out the worst of them. Congrats. Does that counter the point that the video includes many glitches that wouldn't be noticed by most players? No, it does not. Good job wasting your time on a strawman. You have fallen into the classic bad of not accurately reading or assessing a point. xD
---
Also, seizure-inducing light flickering? lol dude. Are you an epileptic or just a big baby? Cause I'm pretty sure you're the latter judging by your response. 
---
Also, pointing out the shitty side of his video isn't defending Fallout 76. Again, you're not very good at reading comprehension, are you? 
---
Yeah this is what I'm seeing the deeper I delve into the locations, looks like I'm gonna have to go through the countless magazine spawn locations and document them first. Then see if u can find regular/above average spawn locations for the tapes. Grognak was in the dam, no magazine just the tape sat there, same with the zeta, just found on the alter shelf in the mine and the tapper was in the terminal in 76. I was hoping the rest had a solid spawn point 
---
I have done very little PVP (deliberately) so I had no idea this wasn't a thing.  Why is this not a thing?  You should absolutely be able to know who took your stuff so you can try and recover it.  That's fine that people can take your junk when you die, as it should be, but give someone a chance to reclaim it.  That's just a design oversight, in my mind, that no notification of who perpetrated that act is communicated.
---
Well said, OP.  A seemingly obvious feature is definitely needed here.
---
I main a Bloodied Explosive 10mm SMG, as others have said, Commando is the perks for it. 
---
It’s one hell of a DPS machine though.

I'm in the early stages of this journey too.

Bulking Ammo to sell, needs to be a thing

It's a bad sign when they are lowering expectations at the very reveal of the game. But outer worlds tho...

I made it to level 25! I now wield the blade of Bastet.  I'm pretty sure the eye of Ra (which I don't have yet) increases it's disregard for armor to 100%.

Good for you for saying you might have been wrong.

I have no idea. Is that a thing?

Not sure why you don't run Barbarian, Ironclad and Evasive + mutations - you'll be far less of a glass cannon, have even greater damage output, mobility, etc.

---
Neverwinter has a great ability system that allows you to create a unique build. They also give you the ability to use loadouts so you can try new things. It would be cool if a system like that could be implemented. Or even the perk system from FO4 would be cool too.
---
I dont believe unarmed works with power armor.
---
Not yet. But if I run across them in my research I'll ping you. 
---
Oh yeah I agree way too much. It just needed toned down vs players and epic monsters
---
Something like that happened to me too. Sort of. Dude showed up, apparently I took his spot, and he absolutely destroyed my camp and me. When I died, the game duplicated my full, modded, power armor, so I was okay with it
---
I don't like mutations as they pertain to the game and so don't run any of them.  Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think there's a Barbarian weapon modification.
---
Man with no legs will not stand for anything.
---
Entitlement? For wanting a functional game for the $60-200 we spent in good faith? Apologist is not a good look.
---
Dude...great work! This is the exact reason why there needs to be test/experimental branch servers. I would have no issue messing around on there to help them fix this game. I did it with Rust. I will do it for Bethesda.
---
If only such a thing existed, by the way legendaries work rn a weapon cannot have both instigating and furious at the same time
---

This kind of thing is the primary reason I've never deliberately done this event.  When I first started playing in Beta and went to begin this event, I found it was an escort mission.  I immediately noped out of there because fuck escort missions.  Crap like this, where the escorted NPC gets stuck on a random object, or when the NPC gleefully runs into danger to die, or the NPC has to immediately engage EVERY SINGLE ENEMY along the way so that the timer can run out, etc.  THIS is why I ignore every escort mission in every game.  They're always done so poorly that it's never worth the time investment.
---
I've completed this event once, ever.  It was on accident when I happened to go to the mountainside bed and breakfast as the event was wrapping up and I got credit.  
---
Otherwise, screw this noise.
---
I might be a pain but does anybody know if there might be cross play in Fallout 76 ? (at least between ps4 and PC)
---
No Barbarian and all the others I mentioned your DR and/or ER.  Just deleted my comment cause I realized it was dumb - you have to have 0 DR/ER for max Berserker.
---
If only they though that hard about combining TS and E...
---
Idk I saw some percentages in the single digits when it came to players that have killed more than 10 players or something like that. I'd pull it up but I am lazy. Story of my life. I bet some people are looking forward to it, but honestly, do we love fallout for pvp or the indepth universe and an immersive wasteland it has to offer? For me, I have played all the FO games to the end (except Tactics) and the story and lore of the game is where my love lies for the game, not hunting level 200+ power armor chumps.
---
Both mods can't spawn together unfortunately.
---
I trusted you.
---
Some part of me has the thought this is just some kind of multiplayer trial run cash grab. Get all the bugs sorted out for some future project. Leave this one to putter along with meagre Atom Store offerings and discounted game sales, eventually going free to play or PS free monthly game to get people in when a lot of the bugs have been ironed out. Usually beta testers get paid, but we paid to be beta testers.
---
This is great! Just a very respectful fyi,I think you may be missing a digit for the marine armor limbs at Welch, unless they really are 1k less than elsewhere.
---
No worries, I appreciate any ideas for things I haven't tried.
---
Its not misogynistic.
---
Nearly every time Bethesda has a reply its not enough, its not good enough, or its not what the community wanted to hear.   
---
Rocket League my brotha.

Great, someone just willingly admitted they were wrong on Reddit/The internet, now we have to shut the whole thing down.

This is why we can't have nice things.

I wouldnt say they would make a killing. I wouldnt pay money for any of the walls. I may buy with earned ATOMS from game play.
---
This is exactly why I’ve never understood the hype around that event 
---
Yes. People are too entitled. Just about everything else you wrote was apparently done without reading my previous comments.
---
Your use of absolutes in your wording is worrisome. You use phrases like "undeniable fact" and "factually incorrect" like you know what they mean.
---
You say "This game was released three months before it ever should have been, that is undeniable fact." but then a few sentences later you say "If it wasn't for the extensive feedback, there would be no updates to this game" I'm confused, according to you if they waited three months to release the game it would have been better, but also according to you the feedback they've received in those three months is the only reason the game got updates. I'm stuck in your circle logic and I think I denied your undeniable fact.
---
I didn't encourage people to stop provided feedback, I can't even begin to imagine where you think you read that. I didn't defend Beth on anything, I do want the game to get better, never said I didn't want it to. Almost everything you wrote is complete nonsense.
---
Please look up entitlement... better yet here ya go: entitlement
---
• the fact of having a right to something.
---
• the belief that one is inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment.
---
You have no right to anything other than the game that was released on day one, but you sure do think you do. Because Beth wants to make fans happy and continue to do business they have given you more, had planned on giving you more will continue to give you more... Please continue to provide your feedback, I know I have and will continue to do so, but please stop acting like a damn child and being so toxic.
---
Fixed, thank you. 
---
Maybe there’s only 2 servers left and both of them are taken?
---
Oh,ok
---
How do they keep killing you? Do you shoot back at them? Or are you low level?
---
i am negan!
---
We came out of the vault and started killing each other for screws and springs. True story.
---
Call them gay, they come a runnin
---
Level 102, and no, I did not shoot back at them.
---
Only stops them from easily tracking you.  Hop servers after blocking them and you will likely never see them again.
---
If you stay on the server and they know where you are hanging out they can find you again.  
---
I haven't seen a single person from my friends list in-game in two weeks.  I check regularly, and every one of them has been offline this whole time.  And I know it's not that they're appearing offline, because that doesn't work in FO76 (try it, appear offline on your PS4 or XBox and ask a friend to check in the game's social menu and you will absolutely show as being online and playing)
---
Xbox
---
no unarmed with PA....  unless you count the rusty knuckle mod for excavator armor only.
---
This is normal. It’s because you are so close to the meat pile that you are seeing the flies up close as they vanish. I’ve been seeing them since the beginning. 
---
Teammates are fair game if anyone participated in the PVP.  Also if you or your teammates took over a workshop.  
---
Stun lock with switchblade.  20 quick hits later, dead.  It's a thing.
---
It was the fever.
---
I am going to offer the lazy opinion....i.e. from a player who wants never to worry about it.
---
Bloodied is king.
---
If you can find a weapon that has damage you're happy with at 100% health, then it only gets nastier as you get hurt.
---
You can choose to optimise for a low-health build if you want to, and it can be devastating.
---
Nice secondary mods are extra damage when aiming, faster reload.
---
Oh hello Soggy I was in your group when you done this you even messaged me it 😂 thanks for covering my gamertag up 
---
Let me clarify for you: not all criticisms are entitlement. Nonetheless, plenty of critics here are entitled and love to act and write like they are due all sorts of things from games companies. 
---
But as a reminder of how the world works, spending money does not guarantee you anything when it comes to gaming. If you don't like your purchase I suggest you try for a refund or, if you truly believe the game is non-functional, bring your case to court. I'm sure once the burden of proof is on you'll fold like wet laundry.
---
Also, I don't know why you'd write 'apologist is not a good look'. What's the purpose of this statement? It comes off as an excuse to use the word 'apologist'. 
---
Yeah, been a while since I actually ran into a legitimate three star. Figured I'd get at least some crappy legendary I could sell. When nothing dropped I was pretty surprised. If we can't farm legendaries from legendary mobs, then what good is farming?
---
Bit of a bugger as I was playing with my friend :/ 
---
&gt;     I don't recall ever putting a game down after 20 hours and saying, wow, that was amazing.
---
&gt;
---
&gt; So don't buy single player, story-driven RPGs.
---
Like Fallout 4, for example? It's a valid criticism, there is way too many fast food sized story-driven games out there.
---
Metro Exodus may intrigue me (I played the first two games), but the linearity was my biggest gripe with them. I just wanted to explore the complete Metro system like I'd do in a Fallout game. The level- or scenario-based structure is too inhibiting to allow for true RP in a G.
---
That looks like it hurt :-0
---
Hive mind ability should give every scorched the location and fast travel to any that are in PvP. It would make it more interesting for the bucket heads if they know that, at any second, a swarm of scorched are coming.
---
I was just chilling around in her camp minding my own business 😂
---
I am enjoying a critical auto pistol build right now and would kill for a 50% critical damage or anti armor gun. In fact, I am killing many things right now in hopes of getting one to drop.
---
I have toyed around with a vampire pipe pistol and can only imagine how unkillable a vampire minigun would make you.
---
an unusual form of Pay to Play, huh?
---
You can always easily join the server your friends are on from the social menu.  
---
Guess I understand now too :)
---
I c wut u did der!
---
Aye, but she’s too busy fighting people at the moment. I’ve left myself as a dead body on the floor whilst I go make myself a cuppa and wait for everything to blow over!
---
I know that feeling.  My pc has 🐝 n on a crash diet and only recently regained the ability to fast travel in excavator power armour.
---
It's OK, it'll be lost in the sea of rage within seconds.
---
Besides, I can't be let loose on a platform like this. I'll blot my copybook again in 3..2..1...
---
&gt; pretty cut and dry desu
---
Everything is cut and dry when you twist words and move goal posts.
---
"1.No explaining how to exploit
---
Do not explain how to exploit. There are plenty of other places to go if you want to cheat. You can mention an exploit exists, but don't go into details here publicly about how to exploit. Take it to PM or one of the many other places to discuss it."
---
"There are plenty of other places to go if you want to cheat" that is the rule word for word. I literally asked where to go and you banned me when I said I wasn't looking to discuss it there. 
---
"You can mention an exploit exists, but don't go into details here publicly about how to exploit. Take it to PM or one of the many other places to discuss it." what I was doing, asking if there was a known community for it. You banned me anyway for trying to point it out. Another case of mod abuse on this shit website. I don't take it personally, you're one in a million now.
---
They went "what do the PVP players want? What do our core PVE audience want? Lets make sure NEITHER sides are even remotely fucking happy". 
---
Totally agree. After 3 server hops to get my camp I said fuck it and found something else to do. 
---
And I do remember reading in an article before beta where they said game had a huge map and the likely hood of your camp location being taken was low. 
---
Yeah right. Happens all the time....
---
It is on pipe pistols.
---
The player base is way to low for this to be even remotely true. I see the same group of griefers on random servers all the time. 
---
explain it to the mods of the subreddit, all I did was point it out to you. obviously something was wrong if you ended up banned
---
On xbox but stop trying to open your pip until the game loads all the way. 
---
I suppose that technically means we’re all being treated fairly then!! Or equally unfairly, depending on your take.
---
Sorry, I'm PC. :( I'd would mid your helmet for free if we were in the same platform.
---
But it is like this
---
I like the idea but there's the chance that whoever takes the junk will stay out of PvP. So even if are aware of that person name unless he/she will directly engage with you there's no way to take back your drop. 
---
Maybe taking the someone else junk will trigger a one minute window where you have the possibility to attack just the thief without being labeled 'wanted'. So a chance to take back what is yours.
---
If I recall correctly they are referred to as "cm" aka community managers, which to my understanding would basicly be people handling social media and other platforms. Put simply basicly a customer rep for a company that can only relay info not really part of the team that fixes things.
---
Could be problematic. Example: guy dies on purpose in Whitesprings, leaves "dead" loot bag in middle of the road with 1 Cork Scrap in. Returns to bag, transfers a bunch of mediocre legendaries there, then lays in wait. Next player comes along and looks, assumes it's the usual Whitesprings ledge dump bag so takes the stuff, and is immediately annihilated by the baiter for full pvp damage and drops whatever accumulated loot, flux, etc
---
They could fix it so dead bags that were checked wouldn't count as Stolen if interfered-with, but they wouldn't. It's Bethesda. Even _if_ they implemented your changes, they'd fuck it up somehow, and probably make bobby pins have weight yet again
---
You're right they dont have to. But if they dont thats no good PR. And PR is very important for a company like BGS. And the bigger problem is that Bethesda has/had a good reputation for their games. Titles like Skyrim, Fallout New Vegas and such are amazing games. Problem with Fo76 were obvious, Bethesda Austin (ex. Battlecry Studios) developed BGS's first online title and also their first game iirc. They rushed it too, probably higher ups wanting more money before christmas that screwed over the devs. Then all the Fo4 bugs ported over. 
---
Bethesda has to get their shit together because otherwise they will lose a lot of money. Bad reputation and leaves a bitter aftertaste for all fans of Fallout/BGS. 
---
&gt;You use such often misused words like "assume" and "literally" that it does make you sound toxic.
---
I maybe used the wrong words. Im not native to english
---
&gt;  \[removed\] 
---
This most likely
---
I'm a hoarder. Being able to fast travel with the excavator pa is very restrained of me lol
---
Well I don't think you can put one on the Somerset since it's not a pipe pistol
---
More closeable windows. The wood walls come with shutters, but barn, warehouse, and brick just have window frames.
---
I just got a meteoritic sword from breach and clear.  +10% vs humans 90% reduced weight, 50% reduced weight.  Looks like a clean chineese officers sword.
---
Are people downvoting this??? Lolol
---
Clear your cache
---
You go through a hole under the porch leading into the house and then open the door leading to the porch. Take a look in the tub.
---
It never occurred to me this is why you couldn't hold e to pick up items, but it makes sense. No wonder I couldn't keep up my favorite hobby of making human centipedes out of raider corpses.
---
How about you gain an extra chance to contract FEV if you engage people in PVP? More kills you get more mutant you become.
---
I agree with you and appreciate our dialog. You seem to have a better grasp of the english language and context than most on this sub. Have a nice day!
---
I mean, I'm honestly not sure why I'm still playing this game...it's been one bone-head stupid decision after another. 
---
Best Buy?  I got the same one.  I don't care about Fallout, but the system was $140 off of the base price of the system, so it was a no brainer.
---
&gt;It strokes todds huge ego.
---
they also love stroking themselves over there tbh
---
Yeah I remember you, and not a problem 😅
---
Pink Pip-Boy...end of story.
---
I hope the board at Beth are failing miserably to justify their actions before an accountability board from Zenimax.  Todd sitting there looking at his stack of papers "it just works" and Hines staring at his hands counting the hairs.
---
Yes, didn't say anything about potato aim :)  lol
---
My point is you have to get as many shots / swings as you can to build that max DPS.
---
It’s a tough one. I’ve been playing since the beta, but aside from the long term challenges I’ve completely run out of things to do.
---
Yet somehow I still find myself playing daily.
---
It’s still got some weird charm to it for me, and it doesn’t hurt that I’ve made a fair few friends through playing it. 76 will always have a special place in my heart for that alone.
---
Yeah OK, but they phrase it like they have a batphone to them.
---
Again, a communication thing.
---
If you wasnt an indoor garden drop a camp fire inside your base on your floor.  The campfire is coded as dirt. Then put your plant on top of it.
---
I think it also depends on your personal playstyle.
---
I'm heavily focused on VATS and crits and for me my dream sniper rifle would be:
---
**1st effect**: Instigating. It kills most things in one hit. Already got a 308 with instigating but it's just 1 star so there are a few things that can be improved.
---
**2nd effect**:  VATS critical shots do +50% damage. My crit build up is really high currently, being able to fill the bar in 2-3 shots. If my initial shot that's being affected by instigating doesn't kill the target, my second or 3rd will definitely kill it, and that extra 50% damage is going to help a lot.
---
**3rd effect**:  25% less VATS Action Point cost. My perk cards allow me to stay in vats most of the time, but a 25% less AP cost would surely help me. Especially when i'm over the weight limit.
---
Obviously this isn't really a rifle that would fit every build. Someone might prefer explosive or faster reload. 
---
Currently when a few perks activate my rifle damage jumps up from 139 to about ~225. Instigating makes that 450 for the first shot. I'm expecting critical to be around 300 damage/shot. Those 2 extra effects would improve my efficiency, but they're not absolutely necessary. The 308 does have a pretty slow reload speed and only 5 shells in the magazine, but i've been farming whitesprings for 50+ levels and it never let me down, it never got me killed. Glowing ghouls die in one hit pretty much all the time. 
---
As close range i used to use an explosive shotgun, until i noticed that i'm damaging myself as much as i damage the mobs. Two-shot weapons are cool, but they don't always work for VATS build, the hit chance % being misleading. That's 2 of the fan favorite effects that i personally don't like due to my own clumsiness and character build.
---
One of the more unexpected surprises came in the form of a quadruple lever action rifle. I only use it if i'm running low on 308 ammo or if the mobs i'm fighting are weaklings. The 20shells magazine with pretty damn decent damage output works really well. Would love a Quad+fire rate+reload speed rifle (perhaps with a .50cal mod since the ammo is so cheap to make...).
---
I guess the moral is: don't just use what everyone says it's the best/must-have. Use what works best for your own personal build, use what works for your play style.
---
Blah blah aware of it blah blah devs informed. 
---
A lot of people got thier first explosive weapons from that event. Also posibility to have 3 legendaries in a short-ish event was good.
---
Right now the only really crazy DPS is bloodied builds, with the right weapon, and the right perk cards.
---
I'm thinking they'll nerf it at some point.  Hopefully not as bad as the triple nuke nerf they did to TSE.
---
Bethesda needs to do SMALL BALANCE buffs and nerfs to builds in the future.  Not just nuke a build into the dirt :(
---
I wish Bethesda would go under. I know that is not a popular belief, but I'm just about over their shit at this point where I'm willing to forgo beING able to experience TES6.
---
Don't open you pip boy or use the fast switch weapon button until after the quest notes load in the upper corner of you screen.
---
There's literally no point in continuing this conversation. You are very clearly far too intellectually impaired to have an actual conversation about this topic. 
---
Strawmen, appeal to ignorance, circular arguments; your posts is inundated with such a ridiculous quantity of logical fallacies that I'm actually embarrassed for you. 
---
Like I said, go enjoy your snow day like the rest of the grade school kiddies. 
---
You've brought back all the feels and now I'm sad all over again that it's gone...
---
Damn you...
---
 A level 1 mole rat hitting you uses up just as much AP as a 91 Deathclaw.  Think about this... a random scorchbeast wants to make you its next meal.  You aren't feeling this fight.  You run away, it spams that god awful scream... sure a bit less damage with dodgy.... but no more ability to sprint.  YOU. ARE. DEAD.  I have the ability to have evasive AND dodgy and I refuse to get Dodgy.  Only I want to decide how I use my AP. 
---
Would be a fun concept to allow players to play as a super mutant or a scorched. Lord of the Rings online have a pvp monster player race option so it would kind of work like that. It would be straight pvp, no crafting/looting and all creatures/robots/turrets are hostile.
---
There are also way to many 'open world, sandbox' games with literally nothing in them apart from a 'story' drawn out for the sake of it. The entire concept of a game built on a computer system doesn't allow for 'true' RP.
---
It didn't work
---
Same here. I appreciate reasonable discussions instead of hate. Thanks :) still learning.
---
You too mate. 
---
That's not what I'm talking about. It would be marked similar to how supply drops mark you for pvp if you pick the lock and didn't call the drop
---
When I accidently took someone's loot in Whitesprings (they died amoungst a pile of ghouls) after I looked up and saw them there, I didn't have a mic so I gave a thumbs down, meaning sorry, they and their buddy thought I did it on purpose.  They started trying to kill me.  I logged off.  Friended the guy.  Logged back into his world and made it right.  That's just how I play the game.  I don't have an issue with just taking the loot either... but, If I found a bag of stable flux I'd know what it takes to get that and try to find the guy that lost it... or at least look both ways do a shoulder shrug and head on out of there... It's a game. Have fun people, maybe even be nice from time to time.  I would agree if I stole some stuff I should be marked for the person to try and find me, maybe for a limited time.  But what would stop me from dumping the loot into the nearest stash box.  You can't rob my stash box.  I guess I better not be over encumbered.  Seems like it may be a fun game inside the game.  
---
Interesting, but I don't think they should do it. Personally if someone takes my junk when I die, it doesn't bother me that much cause I'm the one who decided to run around with a shit ton of junk and ended up dying in either PVP or to the world. And I have occasionally done the same where they died and I took their stuff. Had a similar situation where someone died at WS while it was nuked and they dropped a bunch of stable flux of every kind. So, yeah, I took it. The other problem with this idea is that the people who take the junk, usually leave and find a stash box. So you can hunt them down and kill them, but you're likely to just be wasting your time if they were smart and stashed it quickly
---
Yup Best Buy is where I got mine, it appears they’re trying to get rid of the FO76 bundles since all the other bundles are still $499 
---
I would dump all the utility stuff like lockpick and either just turn this into a bloody build or add more maximum HP with the endurance tree. 
---
If you will be getting one shot at full HP, might as well just sit at low HP and rely on serendipity and mysterious savior to save your ass.
---
The alternative is to just have a massive HP pool and tons of damage reduction through perks like blocker, lone wanderer, fire proof, Suppressor, and more. Also, Cola Nut perk would work well in this case. A nuka cola quantum will heal for 600 HP and won't slow down healing rate like a stimpack does.
---
I was on Starsider I was Reggi Lonestar and was leader and co-founder of the Starhawk Conglomerate!
---
This doesn't sound like a big deal at first, but keep in mind 90% of most people's stash inventory is just crafting materials.  These prefixes make it hard to find what I'm looking for without just constantly scrolling back and forth over the whole list of junk.
---
Another huge annoyance for me is that when I sort by weight, it sorts by individual item weight, not stack.  Who would ever need their items sorted this way?!?!  I am trying to find what the fuck is taking up 200 weight in my stash, not which junk item weighs the most individually!
---
This game is fun, but I probably spend 25%-50% of my time just managing my inventory, repairing weapons that break too fast, and fast traveling to various vendors to offload excess materials that I can't keep because of stash weight limits and I can't sell it all to one vendor because of the damn cap limit on them.
---
lol what a joke, they probably don’t even work on the game and are just there to keep the community in check
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
Okay but the kissy face icon and the kill laugh love sign are great. Also I kinda want the pink pipboy paint to be honest, wish it was more pastel instead of this bright pink colour💖😂
---
I think you're not a bad writer, I enjoyed that :)
---
There'll come a point (quite soon) when you decide "Fuck these terrorising assholes" and turn on it. The satisfaction when you see it's raggedy dead body hit the ground will be epic!
---
I applaud the effort to contribute to the community, but this is a bit difficult to read.  It is a wall of Skittles and probably could be organized in a more viewer friendly way.  
---
You're better off avoiding it altogether. You can get the Water Purifier(on a block) for free by simply CLAIMING a public workshop. You don't even have to keep it. In fact, you unlock many CAMP recipes for free by doing this. Easy peasy.
---
Better yet, why isn't there a second parallel recipe that let's your craft ultracite ammo ,by using your ammo+ flux and ultracite?
---
Apparently. I don’t know why.
---
The post was literally "Anthem isn't out yet and it has better community support than Bethesda" in a nutshell. I don't think that was unfair to say. I mean it is 100% true, go loot at the subreddit for gods sake. Censoring it wont change it no matter how much you do it.
---
Most of my time spent was looking for the enjoyable parts. 
---
I should log in thinking about what I want to do, not what can I do.
---
Neither, get level 3 action boy/girl. if you're Sneak/Crit and not using VATS, you're giving up 60-90% of your damage dealing potential. Once you get Sneak/Crit/VATS going you will almost never be hit, and will end up vendoring piles of stim packs.
---
Here is Sneak/Crit/VATS build with a 33 base damage level 15 handmade in West-Tek
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W-8I--0wz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W-8I--0wz8) 
---
Suppressor and tenderizer are nice. I am using them combined with lone wanderer 
---
I can predict crashes... all I have to do is log on. 30 sec. BOOM
---
Because these are professional game designers.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
This is the only negative aspect of it that makes sense, so kudos for that. However, I don't want to speculate how "they may mess it up". You have a valid point about people filling nothing death bags and then claiming the pvp but it could be solved as easy as making the borders of the bags inventory red or something to let people know *hey, this is a death bag and you might get killed for looting it*
---
the one guy left working will add these “in the future”
---
Amazing video.
---
Ooooh. I thought that was just random structure lol
---
Check your status to see if you have any buffs or debuffs. 
---
Perhaps your armor causes your str to go up when you take damage, or you have a few food/drug/mutation bonuses that shift around.
---
Radworms/mutations..?
---
Same
---
I don't know if anyone has mentioned this yet but this feature doesn't even work a lot of the time. 90% of the time the game tells me my C.A.M.P. couldn't be placed even though there is nothing there. If I go to the exact spot that my camp would be I have no restrictions on putting the C.A.M.P. down. I've tested this even just rejoining the server and if you rejoin a couple times it will place.
---
I have noticed that sometimes the C.A.M.P. will say it can't be placed if someone is already in the area. Not their camp, just a person existing there. If there are a few players in the zone it won't place at all on login.
---
Did your friend revenge while you were partied?  It would explain what happened to you.
---
Thanks for the reply. What would be the reorganization like? Moving the perks around and make a column per color instead of one per special? 
---
I’ve seen pole hook mods at Ferry a couple times.
---
Well maybe if raiders hadn't killed the entire devlopment studio!
---
If they go this route, i will also like them to be a universal market. If someone sells a legendary at Watoga i wanna see it at the Flatwoods inventory. Other than hopping around for caps, i also do it for the chance someone sold a legendary i might like. I found my Two Shot Handsmade Rifle at R&amp;G Station and the Two Shot Gause Rifle from Camden. Those are my only two shot weapons i've seen 300+ hours into the game.
---
They (or rather, the client on your computer) don't know if your CAMP is able to be placed until you join the server, because you have to join the server to find out what's on the server. That's why they give you the option of going to a different server at that point if your CAMP is taken up on the server that you're connected to.
---
You're projecting. You can't suggest that you know what everybody want's based on what you want.
---
It's why I run a 2 hand PA build and a fist weapon non PA build within my special.
---
So that we don't have to pay for FO76's version of far harbour or nuka world. I don't hate the cosmetics only micro transaction store/free DLC model. I do hate all the garbage that's currently in the store though. Its so much trash that i don't even look at the dailies anymore because I've got 6k atoms and never want any of the ridiculous shit in the store. I passed on blackbird thinking "meh.... It's ok, but not that great," little did i know how sparse and pathetic my other options would be. Ive seen exactly 1 guy with that toy paint. 
---
Great, ill have to take a look at those two.
---
yea, he's projecting.
---
I think what he means is that it would tell you before you join the server, not after. Like give you an option to find another game instead of having to wait for everything to load just so you can log out and try again.
---
Yeah, it is looking that way.  Dang.
---
Enthusiasm of the player community? Have you seen the front page of this subreddit?
---
lol:
---
* pipboy
---
* status
---
* effects
---
will tell u what is going on
---
Yeah, you are right and I can tell because you continued to make no actual rebuttals to anything. You just keep agreeing, but not agreeing, slandering and making personal attacks. I'm guessing you're a bit young, don't worry, you'll come around. Good luck to you.
---
Thanks for the confirmation, one does start to wonder if something is broken or it's just me. I'll be patient and keep on scrapping :)
---
There isn't only 2 servers
---
Played the beta and I'm now a lvl 140, trophies that I never got was leaving the vault, reaching lvl 10 and a few of the early quests. So I'm going to have to start a new character just for these trophies, as I'm sure others that played the beta have/done the same
---
personally i use the 1$ = 1 hour rule when buying games.
---
if the game can't for fill that i don't get it 
---
So true
---
LOL, just what melee builds need, another way to become even more powerful :P
---
I am listening.
---
* we currently have a 600 lb stash limit (up from 400!), they have said that they want to ensure there is server stability before they further increase it. 
---
* You are saying that the people who were carrying well beyond their carry weight (I'm assuming ignoring the dupe exploit and the carry weight exploits we had) are causing server problems, and that perks that reduce the weight to 10% of normal is fine. This is why we now have the hard cap. 
---
* I'm saying that if the issue was really only with the people who were carrying hundreds of thousand beyond a "reasonable" carry weight, then there was no reason to hold off giving us stash increases, since 200 extra lbs per person, especially when we consider things like the 90% WR perks, can greatly exceed 200 lbs in weight saved (as someone who was stacking as many weight reduction perks as I can, I know this to be true).  
---
* I'm also saying that if this was being done as a design choice to encourage players to not hoard things, or to encourage different builds - they should be up front and admit that (and realize that the players want more and make some concessions to appease the players), but that is not how it's been communicated, if the issue is that inventory was a system limitation, then since players are clearly not happy with it, they should fix the issue, especially if it's causing people to disconnect from the server even if they aren't the one with the huge inventory.  As of right now, there is no indication they are doing ANYTHING with the inventory system other than a vague "maybe in the future"
---
* Going back to my original point when I started responding, situations like the 4th bullet point show that they don't have a clear direction for the game. And the fact that we don't know what is in or when the next patch will be, we don't have in game support for game issues, that the current team assigned to the game are under skilled for this project and Bethesda pushed it far more than they should have.  It's also apparent from many of the re-used assets (why are there hermit crabs when we are no where near the ocean?  Where is the fog that these fog crawlers are coming out from?)
---
Are they though? 5 patches and 2 hot fixes since launch isn’t dragging their feet. They’re fixing a fair amount of stuff per patch, and if they break something during they fix again sharpish e.g. the weight of bobby pins. 
---
The anger towards this isn’t justified, it’s impudent and entitled. They could opt to do huge updates monthly, or not at all, or weekly, daily etc. They’ve decided to do it fortnightly, consolidating that they can. 
---
Oh, and if they did rush them out they’d make more errors and that equals a raft of “Dear Bethesda...I quit” thought pieces until they repair the damage.  
---
Yup hardly any and last one I launched to spawn SBQ hardly anyone turned up 
---
If the C.A.M.P. system weren't so buggy. If you have a C.A.M.P. that's complicated at all you won't be able to move and place it again. It will always tell you something is floating/unsupported, especially if you've decorated a lot.
---
It's just a meme.
---
No sorry computer
---
Ah, I missed that part when I read it.
---
First... No, it is not 100% guarantee.  Enemies like food have a certain percentage disease chance with each hit.  "Well fed" ups your disease resist while chems lower it. 
---
Second...  You can make at least three disese cures (six with chemist) just from the stuff around flatwoods.  2 Firecaps (In the Ag center basement if not looted), 2 snaptail reed (stream behind flatwoods)  and 2 bloodleaf (Also in the stream).  The Fire caps in the basement are just sitting there so they don't benefit from Green Thumb.
---
$599 actually.
---
Nah it's fun the way it is.  There are some perks you can change out, but Berserker requires 0/0 damage resistance.  I will say this, I can sit under the SBQ's face and attack her all day long.  Not many can say that.
---
I like my diluted Stimpacks.  I get 4 per 1 stimpak and they heal close to full health.  I don't use a lot of them, but they are nice and easy to get/make.
---
You are my new best friend! Thank you SO much for this. I love collecting everything possible, but I don't have a lot of time to document all the items at each vendor. You are seriously doing Lord Cliff Burton's work!
---
Not a penny. I also have 3700 earned atoms that I refuse to spend on the stuff currently available in the shop.
---
It shouldn't, I would like a option to just get in a world with my camp, I do care about my camp location, and I dont want to move 24/7 rebuilding my house
---
&gt;Well, the playerbase is dropping daily.
---
Have some statistics to back that up?
---
My endurance is 1 on my main character. No regrets.
---
Over in AZ the top price comes to $499, but either way we got good deals lol
---
I like the idea of knowing who took my dropped bag. I don't think it should open up pvp though. It would make it way to easy for people to abuse.
---
It's a mutation and there's a few that pair well together
---
get rid of your asbestos and anteseptic. They don't bulk, so you likely have 100's you wan't ever use.
---
Well yeah I agree with you. I am not gonna pay 500 to a door. 
---
Incoming nerf.
---
try scrapping guns made by someone else or just keep scrapping you own until you get it. I thought I had all the combat rifle mods but i scrapped a few i picked up and was over-encumbered by and a mod popped. I think it just gets harder as you learn them all.
---
Don't worry dude... I agree with you. 
---
so the takeaway is, it's the best event for level 40 players!  Boosh!
---
Cool thank you! I'm on ps4 so I hope it works for me too
---
He's counting the bugs and glitches, it doesn't matter if it doesn't impact the game, its still a bug/glitch 
---
I hear you, I do and I understand. I honestly think they would be out here doing the jovial stuff hyping up DLC or whatnot but they’ve been on full blown fire fight mode since launch fending of a community which turned as soon as the Beta went live. 
---
In fact, there’s top posts on here about how the “tone” of the most recent Inside the Vault was too upbeat. Like; what do you want? 
---
For killing scorched with x weapon 
---
 hit up the medical center, the airport and other low level areas. Makes it a lot easier to get the kills with weapons that you don't normally use like the crossbow.
---
If you're playing the game maybe you should convince the dev team to play. Maybe then they could fix some the issues if they see them firsthand.
---
Yes same happened to me the one time i try to pvp for a workstation.  I’m a vats build and couldn’t target them. 
---
If you play on PC you can use this 
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/146](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/146)
---
Ok super helpful thank you
---
I've only seen one person legitimately explain how to abuse it. They said that someone could die on purpose with negligible junk. Go to their bag and transfer other stuff to it and wait for someone to take it. This can be stopped by either changing the border color of a death bag to show it's a death bag or make it so you cannot transfer INTO a death bag only take out from it.
---
I have a plan if you’re on Xbox 
---
That same bug happened to my friend TWO months ago, he never got a response to the ticket he submitted. He ended up making a new character and I suggest thats what you should do to.
---
Is it possible you simply have too many items in your inventory? I've heard of folks crashing out with characters like clockwork if they have too many items or have opened hundreds of hidden map caches without inventory clearing. It might be worth it to drop a whole bunch of random garbage from your inventory in the 30 seconds of uptime you have to see if that helps.
---
Fans. Lots of desk fans
---
I just nuked White Springs, the same 0 legendary items what so ever, just radioactive material, glowing blood and hardened mass? And for some odd reason lost two peices of legendary armor?
---
If they ever are released
---
Well ,as for armor, a 3 stars lvl 40 is still a valuable item,if it has a good roll.
---
Weapons lose way more in those 10 levels; it was negligible before the maxi nerf but now it's not.
---
I don’t know unfortunately :/ 
---
 Armor Bench. Hit space for 'modify'. You will need either the knowledge, a plan, or a mod to implement that. 
---
Wasn't that more or replaced by the lever action?
---
90% of most people's stash inventory is junk? _I'll have you know_ I seem to have no bloody clue how my stash inventory is composed, and I refuse to devote more of my time to finding out XD
---
Agreed, well in my case. I have a PA fetish. I don't play in PA but I collect PA. PA is a little like Pokemon for me. I need them all though I use only 1 on occasion (Excavator) when I want to fast travel with all my junk on me.
---
I'll sell you my quantums
---
It matters when he titles the video '1001 glitches'. It seems clear to me that he just padded it up to get views by adding in inconsequential bugs and then exaggerating the 50 or so bugs he actually has into '1001 glitches'. The whole thing comes across as clickbait. The video doesn't really provide anything of use, either... these issues are well known and he's a few months late to the party. 
---
Plus who in their right mind would sit there watching 3 hours of some guy droning on about bugs in a game that's widely dismissed as poop? It's about as tedious a video as I can imagine, and I'm sure is getting most of its views from the 76 hate paintrain. xD
---
The PVE is like half-life and Stalker combined, in a massive scale. Approaching lvl 290 and love it except the silly pvp mode. You can easily tell the dev team are great at a solo game but aren’t experienced in a multiplayer setting. Right from the start they should have offered two modes, where you either PVE (can’t spam other players) or all out pvp. That way there wouldn’t be a ‘griefer’ issue at all. In PVP they could also have normal mode and hardcore mode which removes HUD and can’t see any players on the map. The only other games I play are CODs in FFA mode, those are way better thought out than FO76’s pvp mode.
---
Responder Vendor Bot can 100% be killed and because he's only level 5 it happens very easily. Twice had him killed by mobs that spawned in and another a few days by another player.
---
I don't mind that he isn't immortal, but damn make him a high level. 
---
Unless your in a pa
---
i literally made a post today because i was sick of seeing these posts from people who didn't read the vault 76 terminals or listen to the overseers logs and "dont get why vault dwellers would fight each other."
---
the second terminal in the game, inside vault 76, sais this:
---
"...Lots of whispering of who's grouping up with who after Reclamation. I worry that the biggest threat to the Project isn't any threat we'll face out there, it's from within. The Ressies are a formidable lot, but give them free reign and Lord help us."
---
Hey thanks for letting me know, I'm on PC though. 
---
Why complain about the video if you haven't even watched it all? 
---
The hunt for screws never ends.
---
Typewriters, desk fans, pepper mills, some clip boards (not battered) 
---
Flag screws in your inventory so items containing them will show a magnifying glass.
---
And he didn't just infect himself with some random FEV strain. He used one he'd been working on and understood enough to be able to create a cure. 
---
&gt;we currently have a 600 lb stash limit (up from 400!), they have said that they want to ensure there is server stability before they further increase it.
---
Which is the part you ignored why that impacts that when you say there should be no reason for an increase to be delayed.  
---
&gt; You are saying that the people who were carrying well beyond their carry  weight (I'm assuming ignoring the dupe exploit and the carry weight  exploits we had) are causing server problems, and that perks that reduce  the weight to 10% of normal is fine. This is why we now have the hard  cap. 
---
Correct your statement that weight reduction perks some how mean they should be able to increase the stash limit without a problem is flawed. The amount of extra junk you can carry with weight reduction is insignificant to those people who are willingly pack muling thousands of pounds of junk, weapons, armor, aid, etc.
---
&gt; I'm saying that if the issue was really only with the people who were  carrying hundreds of thousand beyond a "reasonable" carry weight, then  there was no reason to hold off giving us stash increases, since 200  extra lbs per person, especially when we consider things like the 90% WR  perks, can greatly exceed 200 lbs in weight saved (as someone who was  stacking as many weight reduction perks as I can, I know this to be  true). 
---
There is a reason because the balance between stash limit and server stability (a key sore point for many players) has been thrown off by people exploiting the over encumbered mechanic.  They placed the hard cap to prevent the issue from getting any worse and to target dupers by rendering them immobile and thus unable to play on that account.
---
I'm still looking for the Metal Picnic Table
---
I've done this event one time. He also got stuck on a porch in Harper's ferry. Not going to waste my time again.
---
Out of curiosity, the white house next to the church? 
---
Are you implying that you have to play the entirely of Fallout 76 to criticize it? 
---
3 pieces of unyielding yes, but the second time I just killed him naked :)
---
If you drop the water on the dirty ground it should become dirty water. Surely, we can add dirt to our purified water, right? 
---
Scrapping won't take screws and turn them into something else.
---
If you're looking for "something" in the game, Google it like this:
---
Fallout 76 "something" location
---
Fallout 76 "something" farming
---
That will give you some locations you can check for basically everything.  There's a lot of posts with multiple replies about how to find anything in the game.
---
If you're still having trouble, go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  Players are buying and selling materials there all day every day.  Screws and Springs generally go for 2-3 caps each.  While you're there, sell your extra ammo and materials for caps too!
---
My life is a lie
---
Idk....I just found a level 50 combat armor chest piece doing that event yesterday. Maybe glitch?
---
No, your making assumptions that he only reviewed 50 bugs even though you haven't watched the whole video.
---
Floor bed, would have to give chance to cause disease
---
Thank you
---
Was your buddy/pal/brah interested? I'm not really sure the value cap wise in a trade, but I'm not looking to price gouge anyone. Maybe if he has some other pieces he's looking to get rid of.
---
I like your build, your ideas, and the way you present them :)
---
Can I suggest that you use the [Build Planner](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/) function to write this up? You've already done so here, but if you copy/paste, it'll be in the builds menu, and will allow people to comment :)
---
Soft meaning soft radiation? It's much more drinkable than hard radiation. 
---
 MAYBE ITS THE ALL CAPS THING. I dunno. ;)
---
Dude you are thinking so far ahead to something that currently can't even run stable on their servers.
---
gamertag?
---
Maybe he meant the Enclave bots? But you can't actually access those without said keycard, so it still doesn't make sense.
---
Not sure why though. My alt is a female and the biggest reason I started a female alt is because I want to get the Nuka Girl outfit at some point. Nuka Girl + Nuka Cola PA, will be so good.
---
Same goes for Pink Combat Armour + Pink PA. I want a Pink skin for my Excavator PA. I want a pink Desert Eagle as well but that might be to big an ask from the team. My alt is a pistol build.
---
Stealth sniper comes together at 50 if you don't waste perks. I only have a one star bloodied lever action. My you are 100% gonna die would be a crit from the bloodied dragon I have. It currently one shots lvl 50 scorch beasts no problem haven't ran in to higher today as that gun dropped yesterday. My lever action and build can one shot level 92 death claws as is as well. 
---
Make sure you haven't used full strength Rad-X.  It suppresses mutations.  I used to use diluted Rad-X and Rad Shield, but not sure if they still work without mutation suppression.
---
Also make sure you have Starched Genes equipped 100% of the time when you have mutations.  Any radaway or rad shower use has the potential to kill one or MORE mutations.
---
Yeah, where the fuck is the Winterised Power Armour paint that should've been there day-fuckin-1, like FO4?
---
In the Atom shop release schedule, that's where.
---
He has a list of the bugs he addresses, including timestamps, in the video description.
---
Are you serious right now or just trying to waste my time?
---
Copy that - we've issued a BOLO for all shroud heads in the vicinity. That's an interesting angle. That facet of thematic context has certainly emerged of late and I think it's a good approach, at a minimum on a taxonomic level as an additional level of categorization. Looking forward to see how new ideas build on that!
---
could not agree more, and thanks!
---
Sure, but it was unique and used 10mm ammo.
---
I would like to think the cost of travel was part of they economy thought process in how they did things the way they did...
---
But then again, these are also the same people who put a bobby pin at .10 lbs
---
I'm being serious, you say he only addresses 50 bugs while he actually addresses 53 bugs
---
So I have an issues and been going around with a bunch of CS. For one response times are: 5:17 am, 3:39pm, 5:24pm,  1:39 am, 11:59 pm. 
---
IMO the horizontal axis is good. What needs to change is the vertical axis. I think it would look better if everything were a uniform width, regardless of the length of the perk name, and it was organized by the categories you had at the top. The level it's available could be put into the bottom right corner of each box so long as they were made a bit bigger.
---
Ya, a lot of dupers ruined the market and then left after the tse nerf
---
if it is similar to how it works with leather heavy metal would be a separate plan light, sturdy, heavy are all separate leather armors learn from plans.
---
Many more weapon skins please. And at least 20 more skins for power armors. In a solo game like previous FO series this is not an issue. In a multiplayer game people want to PERSONALIZE their stuff, they will pay REAL money for a little IDENTITY. The dev team is totally clueless about this gigantic demand. 
---
Lincoln's Repeater skin for the Lever-action, Powdered wig, and Hancock's Outfit for President's Day.
---
Keep scrapping, unfortunately.
---
There isn't a set rate for learning them, pretty sure it's all % based. Scrapped 25 lever actions last week, and got *4* mods. Scrapped 15 yesterday, and got 6.
---
I don't think it's in a set, progressive order either, the suppressor was the first barrel mod I got, but I can't get the muzzle brake.
---
It's true I don't see why you are being down voted.
---
&gt;and then exaggerating the 50 or so bugs he actually has
---
Learn to read, bro.
---
So they can't spend the money on hiring a community manager?  They're not exactly hiring a new CEO here its a drop in the bucket.
---
I'm not sure if this is an option for Xbox:
---
Repair / Verify your game.  It's an option on the PC launcher.
---
Remove and re-install Fallout 76.
---
Remove any mods you might be using.  Not sure if there are mods for Xbox.
---
Just throwing darts at a wall.  Not sure if any of this will help.
---
That Hot Pink Power Armour paint was the best one in FO4, bar the Winterised classic of course
---
Str 5, percption 15, chr 4, int 5 agi 15 luck 11 (though I am probably going to lower luck for some int) haven't fully decided. Marsupial is a mutation which makes me jump higher and chameleon is the mutation that made me cloak when killing them naked. 
---
I am using a one star bloodied lever action which dmg is 350+ on the pipboy screen. 
---
If you leave the server it will vanish eventually if no one picks it up. (as opposed to just dropping it on the ground which will vanish as soon as you disconnect)
---
I think they do have one actually.
---
Thank you all. Massively appreciated insight. 
---
Always a dickhead lurking.
---
I heard you could use a meathook but honestly never tried it.
---
Mother F_ckers... that 8s some shit.
---
damn, so if it crashes i lose everything... thats not too ideal :( thanks for the reply
---
placing a letter above or below the word seems to do the trick, and move the support letter to each letter as you go. 
---
It felt real good not gonna lie. I was in the actual station trying to craft just before the video starts when they had started shooting me. 
---
Hey I have the exact same shotgun but is double barrel. You interested? 
---
I wouldn't mind having a rifle looking like a bigger more hefty version of the 10mm SMG
---
When you get around to it I recommend you take the junk yard settlements when you first log in to the game and set up some junk extractors. The one near Charleston has three junk nodes that gives you a steady flow of screws, springs, aluminium, and an array of assorted junk.
---
I hate to be conspiracy theory guy, but i've run Farma Pharma constantly throughout 160+ levels in this game, and i'm sure they nerfed the drop rate for disease cures and antibiotics, as well as upped the infection rate. 
---
Don't get the meds nearly as often, and EVERY FUCKING MOLERAT IN THE UNIVERSE WILL FACE HUMP YOU AND GIVE YOU APPALACHIAN HERPES NOW.
---
^(dammit .)
---
Hope you do it is pretty cool.
---
Then they likely need to just get their act together then tbh, they could earn back a lot of faith from the community if they got their shit together a bit and they desperately need to win some points back at this point
---
For that subreddit definitely. Do these titties look like they lie?
---
Agree. Example: Greaser Jacket &amp; Jeans, while being the most commonly found outfit fucking-everywhere, is 800 in the Shop. Baffling. It's as if they expected us all to form some new player faction based on the Kings from New Vegas
---
Field Sergion or however you spell it lol
---
Diluted radx is enough to give you less than 1 rad per collection. 
---
My thing is are these items actually selling?  Wouldn't putting in a clean toilet or tub sell like wildfire?  I know we represent a small % of the population, but try putting items this sub requests and see how it sells.  Go from there.
---
The quest is largely unimportant, isn't it?  Just show up to the Waste Site and start the Bunker Buster quest directly.  Uncle Sam quest is just a mini-quest to point you in that direction to get you to the Enclave.
---
Glad you put it to the test, I was far too lazy to research it too deeply. If this game had a level 50 uranium fever it would be so so so so so popular.
---
And props for coming forward and being humble. Not enough of that in the Internet these days. You're a bro!
---
Sometimes Alt+f4 works. A few times now the game has spawned crazy high level enemies with no other players around me, for seemingly no reason. I just alt+f4 rather then die. Log back in, get properly leveled enemies and continue playing.
---
I mean I spent thousands of hours in Skyrim but still find LiS one of the most captivating games ever. If gameplay is all you're looking for and story is not a consideration, there are plenty of neverending games out there. Also 500 hours in a game only out for 3 months is bizarre in it's own right. Might want to expand your horizons.
---
I've had the same problems. I had a lvl 103, 33 and 1. never got out of the vault at 1. Been constant for 2 month's, even uninstalling doesn't work.
---
I was using the station to look at the reqs for ultracite pieces when they started blasting me. Besides him, I've only been griefed like 4 times. I actually find the community to be really nice.

I think it's a raider vendorbot thing.  Spikey stabby stuff is often raider stuff.
---
I thought we used beaver ass secretions to make vanilla flavors! 
---
I think every post gets an initial downvote, it seems. Can't imagine why though, but it seems that way to me.
---
Unless they changed it from a two handed weapon ( of which I was not aware) the official guide book lists it as a two handed melee weapon with no secondary type. I know guide books aren't always up to date with patches, but my ebook version is and still lists it as such. Just trying to put out the information that I have from the bethesda team. If it has been patched to no longer being a two handed, then that is good to know, and also a little lame
---
you could always make sure you are on the same server as a friend so that you can rejoin it and get your stuff if you get disconnected.
---
that is how people pass stuff between alts.
---
Thank you! My C.A.M.P. is on top of Seneca Rocks so I have like no way to get dirty water while hanging around there, this'll be a huge help!
---
:)
---
&gt;Hard cap the Meat Pile / Corpse cleanup operation to automatically delete corpses after X amount of time has passed.
---
They seem to be doing something like this already.  Frequently dozens of corpses will disappear at Whitesprings before being looted and they aren't leaving meat piles.
---
in their defence, i am not 100% sure but from what i understood is that austin never really worked with the engine this extensively, and its not them who made the game either, they got it tossed in their lap with a "take care of me plx" note.
---
if this is true however,... its the bethesda logo on the studio that is terrible, not per definition the austin department in it. they just got sold by previous owner and ended up with this
---
I didn't know there was a pre-quest to start "bunker buster". I randomly wandered into the toxic waste dump and started it.
---
The weight system is so broken in FO76. There are many legendary items listed ‘90% weight reduction’ yet still weigh a ton, makes you wonder how heavy those items originally were.  A three-star combat armor weighs five pounds yet claims to have 90% weight reduction, so is a legendary rail rifle and a sledgehammer that I own. You’d think programmers should be pretty good with math lmao.
---
I still farm this event regularly because of Lvl 3 Scattershot granting a 90% reduced weight for shotguns. This allows me to scoop up 15-20 shotguns that sell for 25-30 caps and I can usually pick up around 100 extra shotgun shells all in about 12 minutes. Also being an herbivore I can cook up about 25 glowing meat steaks that sell for 8 caps a pop. If I get a good legendary drop I consider it the cherry on the sundae.
---
Yeah I've had 400+ hours of gameplay. If I go to the cinema for 400 hours I'd pay a fortune for it.
---
I didn't ignore it - I'm saying that if the number of items being carried is going to impact server stability, then it was stupid to add weight reduction perks to the game - since I can just take the perks and carry what I would have put in my stash (and then some).  
---
You're saying that the amount of extra items that can be carried due to weight reduction perks is insignificant and is not a factor to the problem. 
---
Those items have to be tracked one way or the other.  I can carry 100 items that weigh 10 lbs a piece if I use Bear Arms to reduce them to 1 lb a piece, and it would only take 100 lbs of my inventory instead of 1000.  That's still 100 items being tracked, weight means nothing.  
---
So, throwing they players a bone and giving everyone an extra 100 lbs of stash weight shouldn't impact the servers overall since the issue is people carrying thousands of pieces of items. 
---
But you are ignoring the bigger issue that the whole system was flawed from the get go and that they should be trying to fix it but there is no indication that they are even doing anything to eliminate this problem at it's root: their inventory system is bad. 
---
And that's the big issue - they used weight as the arbitrary factor to limit how many items they had to keep track of, they tried to turn a system limitation into a game design consideration, and they are doing nothing to fix the situation.  
---
You represent the slim minority of FO76 players that Bethesda bases most of the game's recent updates on. Nothing against you personally, you understand
---
This does seem like either a paid shill or a blind fanboy. I can spend 50000 hours in prison, but Outerworlds only last four 30 hours, why should I play Outerworlds when I can have so much fun in prison?
---
Looks like you're right. My info was for a previous update. It was returned to the previous method of spawning with the back-roll patch
---
I also farm it for steel, and will continue to do so. As a previous commentor pointed out, the armour drops can be uber, even if not level 50. I eat the steaks though! :)
---
If you finish Belly of the Beast without having done it, I think it starts for you and directs you to Charleston to investigate Sam Blackwell.
---
But there are so many nice things about the Enclave.  Many people probably explore and find it well beforehand.
---
It’s the knowlegde I don’t have, how do I get that. I’ve seen a plan for that anywhere.
---
Pacifist does not prevent damage from other players.  It only prevents you from damaging them.
---
Eh, I’m not saying there aren’t the assholes out there who would immediately try to loot and kill all their fellow vault-mates - sure, there are. Personally, I think that entry was just a dev at Bethesda trying to tell everyone to be prepared for no end-game and bored, trolling players. But seriously, the overseer wouldn’t have known about scorchbeasts or deathclaws when she wrote that. 
---
Besides, I’m not as much saying it’s unrealistic as it is boring, and pvp servers without adding on anything else significant is going to get stale real fast. Factions are being released at some point (so they say), and the game is about reclaiming the wasteland, not waiting 25 years for the chance to kill off humanity in a battle royal. Just saying Bethesda *could* use the chance to liven things up.
---

That does it. I can't take this anymore. Admitting being wrong? Crazy. I'm uninstalling the game now....
---
Yes but it also makes it so I can't get into a fight and lose a caps by being killed.
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Hey, you're a God among Men for admitting this.  Kudos, and I'll click upvote a hundred times (although you can only have one point...)
---
Man, it's everywhere! Inside, outside, middle of the woods, it just seemed to do it at random at first, then it became any time I tried to place armor. Which is a real issue for me because I was farming armor for my teams and had about 13 full suits to swap parts on
---
sigh, another one of these?  what makes OP think the 'Griefer' only plays alone and doesn't make friends to coop with?  probably OP's 'major lack of respect' for anyone who plays this game differently than them.  Also how are u able to tell its a TSE handmade not just an explosive handmade?  Do you really believe the 2 other players mentioned would have up and quit the game for good over their camp being raided instead of just paying 40 caps to fix everything by moving camp?  Do you honestly expect a PVPer to ask the real life age of other players before engaging in combat?   The lack of logic in the post, along with all the unfounded insults, just makes me glad OP was 'greifed.'  "Karma will come to you, in game or irl"

Based on the reply below...press X to doubt.

Yeah, I go to help people out, to grab lots of scrap and XP.
---
There are still perks that make you more tanky without increasing damage resistance numbers. Blocker (which you have), fire proof, and lone wanderer will keep you alive longer. Lockpick should never be worn full time. Just swap out whatever you need for combat when you need to pick locks. Put two of those perception points into endurance and grab fire proof for 45% explosive resist.
---
Plebs as in people desperately trying to manage limited stash limits?
---
If on sale yeah, double yeah if you got some friends to roam around and complete the quests with. The game is honestly fine and pretty fun imo once you work pass the bugs.
---
This is a great start! I e just started a new character and was trying for the life of me to remember when certain things opened up. Thanks!
---
A player needs to go near an event to spawn it in many cases. For example, if I want to run a 'Power Up' event, I go to a power plant.  If it hasn't been run recently, it should pop up. Some may have other conditions. Go explore and find those triggers.
---
&gt;I didn't ignore it - I'm saying that if the number of items being carried is going to impact server stability, then it was stupid to add weight reduction perks to the game - since I can just take the perks and carry what I would have put in my stash (and then some).
---
But you ignore the point of them. It is to allow a little bit more weight while remaining below your carry threshold.  The changed was to not punish players as much in a game ere they can't just save and restart the same sequence of events over again over again.  They were trying to be generous and players took that inch then used that inch to force a big splintery wooden pole up the game's ass hole. 
---
You can still be revenged killed for bounty
---
It was good for scrap. 
---
Sorry got to be pump action but thank you!
---
Ah thank you. I still think if you are on pacifist you shouldn't take damage but that's just me. 
---
Whoa.
---
Because... wait for it... *it's a virus*
---
That.  Is a really great set of photos.  
---
The surprised look really makes them shine.
---
I’ve played Fallout for decades now, and though I understand the hate, and there are bugs, I’ve really enjoyed playing the game.
---
I’ve muted the voice communication, and mostly play on my own.
---
The only thing I will say is that it takes some getting used to the fact that there are little to no NPCs.  All the story and the quests are told through holotapes and robots.
---
I would say it’s worth the current price.
---
I feel the Fo76 shop is a bunch of outdated Dad jokes and not taking itself too seriously.  It's all missing the cool factor for those character skins.
---
I personally have never found Sturdy or Heavy Metal plans.  But I have found Sturdy and Heavy Robot plans.  So I am very confident they exist.
---
And I'm also just as confident that mods learned for any of the tiers apply to any of the others, Light/Sturdy/Heavy.  It does for Combat Armor, Leather Armor, and so far Robot Armor.
---
I love the game. I haven't had any bugs that made me hate it. Just have an open mind. Also, turn on pacifist mode to not do pvp. I love seeing others buildings
---
I feel we should just get the standalone version (server, client and some dev tools) so the community can have fun creating new content for it.
---
I love it and only have grouped with my wife. The multiplayer is nice when a bunch of super mutants spawn and you world have died if it wasn't for that other vault dweller or two that can along and bailed you out.
---
We should be able to LOCK our items in our pip boy so they can't be scrapped, dropped, traded, or sold.
---
Then any legendary items we have UNLOCKED should be able to be SCRAPPED for a 5% chance to pull one legendary modifier off the weapon.  That legendary mod would act just like a weapon / armor mod (a one time use to attach to any weapon / armor).
---
People can now farm and grind to their ideal build.  Bonus is it makes mass duped weapons LESS valuable.  Why go for a duped weapon everyone has, when you can effectively grind your perfect weapon for your build instead?
---
Level 40 TSE weapons were better in every way than just one start legendaries at 50. Hell if modifiers are good enough i will still use level 40 three star equipment. 
---
Honestly, that depends on what you liked about those other games.  For me it gives me the exploration, creation, and customisation enjoyment that I got out of Fallout 3 &amp; 4 better than either of those games.  There are a lot of other things it doesn't do so well though.  And it is still a bit unstable and buggy.  So if you're looking to wander around, see the sights, build a base, and have a good stock of patience you will probably have a good time.  That's why I'm still playing and still enjoying my time.  
---
Other people were looking for other things, and 76 fell flat for them, unfortunately.  
---
I'm enjoying it. I have played and loved Fallout since the first game was released, and played all the sequels to completion, multiple times through. The thing to remember, though, is that this is NOT the standard fallout game. It's more of a survival game based in the Fallout universe; the story is almost all environmental and casual, with the focus being on exploration and character maintenance (eating, drinking, reducing rads, avoiding diseases, and fixing up your gear as it degrades.) If you get it, I highly suggest you look at any of the many Fallout 76 build forums and find something that gels with your preferred playstyle; I leveled two characters to 50 before discovering how badly I had chosen perk wise, and have two more that I've now leveled to the 30's that are a lot more fun to play, because they are specced so much better.   
---
Another key is to find some folks you like to play with, and at least occasionally, do stuff as a group. I mostly solo, but I have about 10 folks that I regularly team with and its always a lot of fun. If you have a mic, its a HUGE help when teaming up to do things.
---
I see Prey I upvote 
---
Glad it helps!
---
Yes. It is buggy but a lot of fun.  
---
still tastes great though. spoon feed me more shit if it tastes this great.
---
I'm avoiding that quest on my current run, along with 'Mayor for a Day' for All Rise, until 50. Perfect Storm, along with a few perks (any limb damage boost especially), is going to be my ranged backup on my Power Armor/Melee build. 
---
The plans for Sturdy/Heavy metal exist, but I've never seen them. I don't know if they can drop in the game. Some people have them but I don't know if they came from plans from the dev room. I have obtained the Polished mod for arms, legs, torso, and helmet from scrapping. Here's my spreadsheet with all the mods and the learn chances.
---
From event reward or as a drop? 
---
If you are going to play on console, I would suggest seeing if you can get it on redbox first and try it for a bit.  Really play it.  
---
If you enjoy it and don't mind whatever issues you face, then I would see if you could pick it up as part of a buy 2 get 1 free used game deal, or see if you can get it for under $20 somewhere. 
---
That too.
---
Cause its survival of the fittest.
---
That certainly helps, although I still have trouble placing my apostrophe. Thank you very much.
---
Why, oh why, does Bethesda do stuff like this in such a half-assed way? Either the letters should snap together and all be in the same plane, or they shouldn't snap together at all. Are they letting people code this stuff who don't grasp the concept of three dimensional space?
---
Maybe between the 600 stash limit patch and before the latest patch. I had fun for a while when Whitesprings was still a thing. It's the only place where I felt any sort of community, people dragging hordes of zombies out of the restaurant to the ledge outside so we could mash them with melee weapons. Now after the latest patch it feels like the game is beyond salvation. You can't make a build without worrying if it will get nerfed to hell and Bethesda isn't going to help you out with a respec after they bend you over.
---
My first one looked like Arthur Morgan 
---
Is uranium fever one of those? I've had times where i went to watoga high and monster mash started up.  
---
But most time i go on a dead server and the guy at UF tells me "The vents are cleaning".
---
welp, case closed!
---
It is. Burnout sets in late by most standards.
---
I hit 250ish when i shelved the game.
---
Average is probably above 100 hours
---
IF you're on a PC, there's [Better Inventory](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32)
---
I'll second that! I play with my fiancee, and it's awfully fun to be able to call someone over to look at something cool you found, in world, or to be able to jump in and help someone out of a jam. Or to bail you out of a mess you got yourself into!
---
I'd tell you but I also don't know how to do spoiler tags on mobile.
---
Schematics that can be found in the world and perks to upgrade the backpacks I wouldn’t want to pay money just to carry more either 
---
It's among the most rare, and some statistics I saw a while back estimated it at a 2% chance of showing up. Note that you can buy it from another player for 2-3k caps, so it shouldn't be that far out of reach of a few days of vendoring.
---
You'll get one faster by farming 1,400 caps per day from the vendors than you will by hopping 24/7 to get one from the Enclave vendor.
---
Yah I was interested in it and would have gotten it if it was for combat armor and leather armor.
---
Are you on ps4? Add me S0l1d5nake666, I’ll be glad to give you 150 screws to help you out . It’s pretty hard to farm sometimes for screws . Try to mark the items in your pip boy for search to be sure that you don’t miss the junk that have them while looting 
---
Not until they fix the game. If you wait, you'll be able to have a smooth experience. I would recommend going back and playing the older titles before getting 76. Give it sometime.
---
I agree however Bethesda wasn’t smart enough to make it that way
---
Probably ppl in a party.
---
Hey, thanks very much. I really enjoy photomode.
---
I got one set of x-01 calibrated shocks from whitespring after a 7 hour play session.  I wondered if it was connected to how long I was playing, but it's likely this is incorrect
---
Great song too. Wish it was on the soundtrack. 
---
Ok. Well come the weekend since I'm at my partners tomorrow and Friday I'll be farming caps like crazy. Will feel sorry for other players when no vendor has any caps to give
---
Got mine in 14 hops. Did a total of 26 and also got the stealth mod. You just need a bit of perseverance 
---
Right.  If you take someone else's bag, who you are not already in PvP with, it should make you as wanted at least to them if not to anyone.  Like lcok picking a camp or supply drop.
---
You played 150 hours and found 6 TSE?  Hmmm...  idk man
---
Such a negative Nancy. Stash management is the main end game content and here you go wanting to set it on easy mode. ;)  
---
And patience
---
Damn beat me to it
---
If you can ignore the bugs, yes, it can be OK. But the most fun I've had with the game was witnessing the bugs.
---
Accidental damage causing wanted status is literally the only valuable thing on this list, but is mostly pointless because there's so few people on the same server.  
---
The rest of that stuff is the best you can do with a full dev team and a week?  You guys have GOT to be on a skeleton crew.  This is like a sprints worth of work for 2 people.....
---
I've been playing co-op Far Cry 5 this week. Great fun.
---
This reminds of the comic showing old link putting all the items back into the dungeons and sealing them up for the next hero of time.
---
But isn't Metro more a shooter with horror like Evil Within, Dead Space and Resident Evil?
---
If it is like those then 20 is enough for me. I can't imagine myself wanting to play more than 20h on those types of games. Maybe multiple plays over time to rake up more hours but on 1 playthrough it will get boring for me. Sweet spot on that genre for me is 15h.
---
Yea I have that mod, but unfortunately it only works when in your pipboy inventory and not when looking at your stash or when crafting.  Its great otherwise.  Being able to easily find food/drinks in your aid tab is crucial.  I would definitely starve/die of dehydration without it. 
---
I would really like it if dead enemies that I haven't looted yet were highlighted, so I could find their bodies easier. When you're playing long range or mid range, you can't reap your rewards until everyone is dead, and usually by that time, the bodies have rolled down a hill, hidden in thick brush, turned to meat piles, or missed if you've massacred an entire nest of enemies. Make it a perk card. I'll put 1 point in perception to find dead bodies.
---
Probably said a million times, but now it's said a million and one times. Please give us the option to scrap/sell ammo. Also, please let us save our mods like FO4 instead of having it outright destroyed.
---
So funny how every server had its own completely different economy and culture in that game.  
---
Haha thanks.  The people that disagree In this situation don’t matter. It’s a video game. If they want to spend their energy bitching about something recreational then let them. Nothing else is going on in their life.
---
My bloodied explosive lever does typically the same dmg as my tse gauss, yet the lever uses half the ap.
---
It says the name of who took your bag already. If they were smart, they partial loot it and there's no notification.
---
Lol.  I like collecting the quantum’s vs buying.   Unless they are cheap.   
---
What’s your price? 
---
Why are they even still paying the marketing people? The second 76 released Pete Hines disappeared off the face of the earth. That was after him lying to us too. 
---
It was originally advertised as having a huge open world.
---
It’s more like a huge world on rails.
---
As simple of a fix as it should be, why are only five things being addressed? They spending the other 39 hours on the rad worms?
---
yes. saw this last night. although I can't for the life of me recall which one.  I only visited about 4 vendors though, so R&amp;G, grafton train, grafton town morgantown train.  it's likely one of those four. sorry I can't be more specific.
---
Because the shapes of the armor are different so they would have to design several different variations
---
Agree.  If someone raids a dropped bag it should make them wanted.
---
Plan then would be to take all but one item in the bag, hide until that person comes back then attack them.
---
Just like this pink paint job is even tho it is for Valentine's Day theme.  Hmmm.... I wobder why.  
---
But did you then kick everyone else off as well. When I do it it brings down the whole instance. 
---
A skin for every weapon in the game. They could literally throw one out every week and it would take a year before they run out. Then they could just repeat or make new ones.
---
I didn't realize how terrible this was until I just read this post.  You are correct, this was a piss poor design decision.  
---
But in the light of the entirety of fo76 it's par for the course, sadly. :(
---
I don't know that I've ever downvoted anyone on reddit before, as I don't spend a lot of time here.  But you gave me a good reason to get started.
---
I have no junk. And can still fast travel
---
"we don't care"  
---
Fixed it.
---
You know, it might have been a reward. It was a legendary regeneration one though...
---
That was my understanding, too. The rainbow paint is straight out of The Pack raider group. But then everyone complains it’s not immersive enough, or that it’s hideous and not masculine. You do not have to buy it. The Pack strapped teddy bears to their chest and had neon rainbow rifles to murder you with. My only gripe is that they made the paint for one type of armor set, these should be applicable to all armors in the game if you’re paying money for them. 
---
I’d also like to be able to “transmog” my armor type to another armor type without losing the stats, but that’s another conversation. It’s an rpg, give us the options to completely customize our look! 
---
This thought bothers me so much I may have discovered a neurosis that I was unaware of.  Thanks Doc!
---
But they already have zenimax online for MMOs
---
From a publisher point of view you don't use your single player studio for testing MMOs when you have another that has proven to actually know what it's doing
---
And from a dev point of view you ask the MMO veterans over at the other studio for tips, you don't go in blind.
---
you mean a SINGLE post in this thread isn't good enough?  
---
Cmon, look at that fix list!  They detailed 4 things no one gives a crud about and one thing that doesn't matter because population is so low.  Its basically fixed.  Lets work on some $40 dlc and new stuff for the atom store.
---
I'm done arguing the weight system. It's deflecting from the issue at hand (but at the same time proves it) 
---
You are here trying to argue on behalf of Bethesda on their overall flawed system.  And you are doing this because they developed a flawed game, do not have clear communication with the players, and are not putting sufficient resources to patch the issues (weight being just one of them).
---
The REAL issues at hand:
---
* We have no roadmap for the game: when is new content coming? when can we expect patch updates?
---
* Patches have not been coming out consistently, and often have just as many issues as they have fixes.
---
* They are not listening to the community, instead adding to the tedium of the game to buy themselves more time
---
* Their communication as a whole sucks.  
---
You certainly made it sound like it’s about you losing your junk.
---
You could have tried to kill the two other people that was there to get your junk back...then as you look thoroughly through their bags you get killed by your friend and spawn to find your “friend” is no longer on your friend list.  
---
Bah made up statistic. And they aren't very rare. You'll see them regularly after level 150. The shocks are kind of rare.
---
I'll check him out in a bit, logging on in a mo. Cheers
---
That's awesome, thanks! Glad to welcome you into the fold.
---
Since the Nerf I've thrown several plan two shots on the ground when I'm over weight I thought I had bad luck sorry bud you need to find better spots. 
---
Anti-Armor for Automatic/Low Damage Weapons
---
Bloodied/Instigating for Rifles/Melee/Unarmed/High Damage weapons
---
I have only seen " Another player has picked up your bag" no GT/IGN/PSN ( I only play on console though) with no indicator of the person. 
---
You want to type `[the text to hide like that](/spoiler)`.
---
Agreed!
---
And speaking from Ireland, can I say I like your username ;)
---
Yup... Been waiting for the dark military green ever since release....
---
ah yes , the easiest thing like retexturing can't do it right 
---
Yes. That is all.
---
You got revenged
---
what is wrong with the players on 76..if u see two players in a trade..why bother them?
---
Yesterday i was at whitesprings by the golfclub and there were two players on top of the bus completing a trade..then out of nowhere the one player kills the other player..i dont know if they were disagreeing on something or whatever but they were both over level 150..and i couldnt figure out if the other person was mad or was just trying to steal the other's loot..im done with randomly doing trades in the wasteland..its either reddit or none
---
Not made up, but based on some small scale testing someone performed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abuubx/x01_mods_100_server_hops_to_enclave_armoury/). It's not a massive sample size, but it is indicative of what you can roughly expect.
---
It took my almost 40 handmades to get the suppressor
---
The pvp bag-deathmatch first, then update to fix any issues three months later, bet ya
---
I have awhile to go before level 150. I'm only level 63
---
If it could work in stash I’d be so happy. I all too often take my junk out of stash just to see the big picture in my pipboy. 
---
Cool, I'll try this but I gotta say. I find so much boiled &amp; purified water that I've not had to touch a pump, pond, lake, stream or rivelett in 30 levels.  I'm at lvl 54 now
---
He actually had one he prefers, I'd love to get it for myself but I'm poor as hell, I could only offer like 1k caps. I think it's probably worth like 3 or 4x that
---
I made a similar complaint about Perk Names a while ago.
---
We currently have
---
 - Lockpick
---
 - Expert Lockpick
---
 - Master Lockpick.
---
Which will sort alphabetically with all of the other Expert- and Master- perks you might have.
---
We should have
---
 - Lockpick : Basic
---
 - Lockpick : Expert
---
 - Lockpick : Master
---
Or something to that effect.
---
Power armor and weapons paints should be their main focus for money then goofy shit second...
---
We forgive you.  ;)
---
In my head, I thought Excavator PA would classify as T-45 armor, since that is what they were based off. Good thing I read this post because I would have bamboozled myself too. Thanks for taking one for the team, man.
---
I bought it from Grahm, but that was prepatch, so good luck.
---
Honestly I'm already OP, have Lone Wanderer maxed and love lock picking.  Sure you can move some stuff around, this is just what I do.
---
I'd thought it would be interesting for the game to auto-sort players based on level groupings into servers together. That way lowbies can enjoy a map that isn't full of 45+ level enemies and vets can explore all sides of the map without curb stomping all the mobs they come across (as opposed to just one half of the map being slightly more difficult than the other). 
---
Coming from someone who's very much a fallout fan.
---
I started Fallout 76 later than most. I delayed my purchase due to the noise surrounding it's release.
---
I wasn't interested in the multiplayer aspect and was more hoping for a new campaign/story following being largely invested in Fallout 4s story.
---
I have had some fun. I have also rage-quit a fair amount of times due to server issues, quest issues, inventory issues, bugs and game crashes.
---
I am only level 28. I find the quests very mediocre. No cutscenes, or story following YOUR character. You really are just a survivor and the story is basically you descovering what happened X amount of time before you got out of the vault. 
---
There's no Shaun. No looking for your son, nothing like that. Which to me, was VERY upsetting.
---
Now putting all of that aside. 
---
The game has an ongoing fallout vibe. Maybe it's just my imagination, but I feel like all the emptiness in the world is actually leading towards salvation. It feels like this is the hidden main story (but again, this could just be my imagination).
---
Perk initially for melee damage as it is almost required to have fun.
---
I think unless you have a friend you're going to be levelling up with from the start, I'd recommend going at in alone.
---
It's a survival game. It's quests are more of a way to cover that map. The perk system and ability to keep leveling means that you can have fun pimping your character out.
---
You CAN have fun, just don't expect to be blown away.
---
Hope this helped.
---
PS: I also got the game for $30 AUD.
---
I’ve got a Lvl 50 Quad Exploding Vats reduced Western revolver that punishes. With concentrated fire, adrenaline and gun-fu I can clear a white spring mob in one clip. Stringing together head shots killing everything level 62 and below is surprisingly fun.
---
Was anyone actually wondering how PvP worked into the lore though?
---
Xbox, I learned heavy metal chest and legs, missing the arms. I have no idea how I got them tho. Dont know if it was a plan I found or from an event.
---
Dont have any sturdy.
---
Thanks mo chara! 
---
I have played 1, 2, 3, NV and 4. I enjoyed all of them. Yes some of them are better from others but if you love Fallout universe you do play the game and try to enjoy it instead of complaining over and over again. So I bought 76 and enjoying it too. My only fear is the if Bethesda abandon this game in future.
---
I honestly didn't even know there was such a thing.  I'll check it out, thanks.
---
Or use them to craft a super rolling pin maul (literally just a bunch or rolling pins nailed and taped together into the rough approximation of a sledgehammer).
---
Vats matrix overlay for excavator P.A, clean white interior walls, paint for my all rise and handmade, clean faction flags
---
Upping the damage doesn't change the fact that the armor system is being horribly misused. 
---
If you tripled the amount of health on an enemy and gave them 0 armor the lmg and minigun would absolutely shred through that type of enemy, meanwhile the average heavy hitter would become half as effective, or even less, as they don't gain much from the change in armor, and lack the raw dps to grind through that amount of health.
---
For a super sledge to match the raw dps of a minigun takes a per hit damage of at least 625, which is way less than a super sledge does normally, however if you give an enemy 15 armor the minigun drops by half, and the super sledge doesn't even register the change, give an enemy 140 armor and the minigun loses &gt;80% of it's damage, but a super sledge dealing 140 damage only loses half, and the average armor for level 50+ mobs is 175.
---
There is no reason for mobs to have such high and homogenous armor amounts. The armor system makes it so armor acts as a filter, weapons too far above or below are less efficient than weapons in a specific damage range. 
---
If all enemies have the same armor, they all die best to the same weapon. There should be enemies all over the defense spectrum, 0, 100, 1000, 10 000, 100 000, any armor amount can work, but instead they all fall into a very narrow and particular spectrum of armor that ruins the balance of weapons.
---
Depends on the kind of player you are. If you love the exploration and are patient/understanding, then you can probably work through the issues. I’ve put in hundreds of hours and am still loving it.  
---
If you’re the kind of guy that will punch your screen because you got yet another legendary wood leg or that three star legendary had its corpse disappear on you, then maybe another game might be up your alley. 
---
This is unintended behavior and will be addressed in the next patch 
---
Only cures my diseases.
---
Pink paint and pip boy are atrocity to fashion? For Valentine's Day themed items? Why can't pink be badass?
---
Nope. It's totally justified. The game is so bad it's embarrassing, and they have mismanaged it from the start. They really do need to appeal to the player community if they want to retain any of the user base. 
---
Ive been enjoying it playing solo, and letting myself get immersed by everything. Lately though, im running outta steam. If i kill another 3 star legendary again and get nothing worth the fight, or if i can loot stuff because loot doesn't even load, i think i will stop playing for a while. Its an awful feeling, because i really like this game to lose it due to basic core bugs.
---
I got the same icon on my T-60 after installing a bright headlamp. Weird but useful. 
---
This was a trade from Reddit and they randomly attacked 
---
Battle bot event
---
I would love if dropped by death bags were labeled differently from dropped to share bags though. Sometimes I have no idea if it’s s death or gift bag. 
---
This original thread the guy is saying the studio, and developers don't care. When in actuality they do, its proven in the patch notes and upcoming content. The community complains, they fix it. Here's a couple examples "my power armor light isn't bright enough" fixed. Paper bag drops keep disappearing... fixed, this vats glitch sucks... fixed. Not to mention server stability. I used to crash/blue screen frequently, since the last patch. I haven't blue screend once. 
---
This is one of my favorites "I killed a 3 star legendary and didn't get anything good" so your supposed to get an epic 3* weapon every time you kill a 3star? No that's not how its supposed to work, good 3star weapon rolls are supposed to be rare. That's what makes them special. 
---
All I'm saying is there is a trend on these forums, and I'm not jumping on the bathesda bashing bandwagon. I see them making great changes, and quite honestly I'm happy about it. Looks to me like the studio is going in the right direction. 
---
Or allow you to instant msg the player that it's an accidental drop. If they reply ok it goes back to inventory  or no to trigger a chance for revenge. Have a 1 minute time to initiate.
---
Dude, no way. I'll part with it for less than that. Any interesting plans you have?
---
Oh that one? 1500 atoms, and for a week only, on that one week you're gonna be away on holiday
---
'Tis the new meme.
---
Like 30 caps a piece
---
I mean, yeah that's why the system is bad but even in a system with lowered armor and higher health most of the big guns are terrible.
---
Minigun and LMG have piss poor damage and DPS even vs low armor enemies with decent health, and they chew through ammo and durability like it's going out of style.
---
Fixing the armor system, and giving a large damage buff to big guns is the correct thing to do otherwise big guns still won't be worth the ammo consumption and repair costs like they were in the previous games where they were also high dps workhorses of damage.
---
Pc, console? Its worth alot. 
---
Legendary Wastelanders Gauntlet 
---
I like this idea and it inspires a few of my own, based on some of my earlier ideas about baiting bounty hunters into a trap base. I had a lot of grand plans about building a maze with lots of traps and stuff. Never really got around to it and didn't completely understand the mechanics if they could just destroy everything. But yeah maybe I will think some more about this. It sounds interesting.
---
Nice find.
---
they would then have to make turning into the scorched a thing too.  i actually wouldn't mind either of those options. 
---
Dude - they can't even get the game working properly....
---
Failte ;)
---
This has happened to me before also. I couldn’t go near Whitesprings until I finished the Enclave quest line 
---
I built my camp on the street to the prison.... Seemed like a good idea as the prison is great for supplies. But the water issue was my main issue. 
---
for 39.99 i got my moneys worth of entertainment.
---
Depends on you, the game is ok, but it’s not anything game changing, the bugs on the other hand can be.  
---
•It’s quite grindy, and sometimes your guns don’t feel satisfying to use at all.  
---
•PvP is basically whichever guy shoots the other guy second, or whichever melee build teleports across space and time to smack the other guy second.  
---
•Now the variety of monsters is what drove me to want to play the game, there’s quite a few, but you need to find them.  The majority of enemies you will face are the scorched, basically raiders, as you level up super mutants and mole men become the norm.
---
•Crafting?  Necessary, but a pain to assemble anything, like by the time you get materials to craft something, or repair something, you probably found a better version with more stats that fits your level.  
---
•Perks are surprisingly fun, some people complain that RNG ruins the potential early game builds, but I like to think it adds to the whole survival aspect of the game.
---
•Speaking of survival, the majority of the time you won’t need a lot of stuff, but I’d advise you to prepare sets of food, and water before each expedition less they way you down for carrying everything.  Be aware of your hunger, thirst, and all diseases/debuffs.
---
•Inventory space is something you will complain about as you continue to collect more things, especially if your the type of person to hoard all the legendary weapons you collect, and not sell them.  Or if you always grab junk because, “I might need it later(you will).”
---
•Community?  Love it or hate it, it’s filled with dedicated fans who stick through all the backlash, and haters who want the game to burn in the 9th circle of hell for betraying their expectations/trust.
---
All in all I’d say it’s fun, well when it works.
---
It looks dumb without the chaps
---
Has anyone seen mod plans for sale anywhere, or dropped in specific locations?
---
I hardly ever see them and my scrapping hasn't netted much of anything. 
---
I have a berkerkers on PS4. Would be open to a trade for something else. I had a non-legendary that was awesome, but made the mistake of scrapping it. ... it wasn't automatic, but it had a silencer. 
---
go to buildings like municipal buildings not houses they usually have a ton of desk fans..always look out for desk fans and typewriters..the best loot in the game is giddyup buttercup
---
To be real diabolical you would need to bait an enemies into your base encase them in foundation, then bait the bounty hunters into a long maze of foundations then when they are in seal it off, can’t get out can’t fast travel out.
---
Oh I am sorry, I put in the wrong link!
---
I should have put this one: https://www.falloutbuilds.com/create/
---
You can link your build to this, and do the writeup. It goes into the "builds" section automatically, and the perks etc auto-link - it's really easy to use.
---
I was just suggesting your build idea would be valuable and appreciated :)
---
It should be a charisma perk like in FO4: Invest 500 caps in an investor so they can can buy 500 caps worth back from you.
---
Nope tried it with my mutants one with faster swing speed because I thought it was a one handed weapon
---
whats an invisible foundation?
---
/ Lord Cliff Burton
---
So I'm not the only old fart that plays
---
From the producers of Nika Cola, now try  "Roentgen Rotgut" they use gamma instead of alpha. 
---
&gt;it really grinds my loose gears
---
The wooden foundations are on concrete stilts but the giant open space in the middle is still solid in the game code so you can see through it but can’t shoot though it(it acts just like the solid concrete ones)

Timeline of Fallout 76.
---
Pre-Release:
---
Community: Oh Wow, this is going to be great
---
Bethesda: Here are all the great features we will be planning.
---
Beta:
---
Community:  this game is shit, fix it before full launch.
---
Bethseda: we are fixing this stuff
---
Launch:
---
Community: I like the idea, but its broken, fix it
---
Bethseda: we are fixing it, here is what we have planned
---
Now:
---
Community: You didnt fix it fast enough, my mommy says you suck
---
Besthesda: We are working as hard as we can to fix this
---
Community: Tell us more, we want updates
---
Bethesda: Here is your update, good things coming'
---
Community: Not good enough, learn how to code.
---
Bethesda: We are listening, here are a few more fixes
---
Community:  Not good enough, we want more, you guys suck.
---
Bethesda: Here are more fixes we have planned
---
Community: stop fixing this and just close it, you suck and noone wants your product. 
---
Me during all of this:  I like popcorn  and mike and ikes. 
---
Does noone here understand that MMOs dont work properly till 6 months in.  Everquest was broken as all hell in 99 when it launched, so was WoW in 2005, so was Guildwars, and Rift and Anarchy Online, and Dark age of Camelot, and Neverwinter, Lets not even talk about FF11 and I could go on.   
---
As a MMO gamer since before most of you were born (i started in '95 with text based MUDs), this is par for the course.   Let them refine the product now that they have a full playerbase to test the integrity of their systems and work through the issues like all other MMOs
---
In 3 months this should be a fine tuned machine.  If its not, then you can throw a fit like the spoiled kindergartner that you act like.
---
A quad?
---
bags dropped intentionally should be treated differently than bags dropped due to dying
---
What the hell, it kicks everyone off apart from you? So you’re always in an empty world?
---
Dude you don't understand at all how the internet works. When you're wrong and somebody proves it with facts, you dig in harder. You yell louder. You swear. You make comparisons to Hitler. You redirect the topic to vaccines and abortion and gun control. Get a clue.
---
Only in the wild!  My Bear and sleeping bag are all clean and fresh!  ;)
---
Would be kinda funny if you werent griefing people
---
Do what guildwars did, if you locked the item onto your character it couldn't be traded after and received a damage bonus. I like the idea of legendary mods, but it would make the game very easy to min max and people would stop playing imo. What's to grind for other than plans then? And to the op.. It's rng but it's not all rng. There's ways to tip the legendary table in your favor.
---
The weapon tied to creature sounds interesting. They do that already with normal guns that drop. Probably too many weapons.
---
See this is why we need the Rock-it Launcher/Junk Jet to fire off useless items. Even better if legendary items do some sort of bonus damage based on the effect. 
---
Thank you for the lead, I'll check those out.
---
Taking someone's bag should make them wanted like picking the lock of a house that's not yours 
---
How am i greifing people?
---
Adding some reason to PvP is the only thing that could start to save this game, but it's not gonna happen. We should be able to have individual containers and break into each other's bases, but again it's just not gonna happen.
---
Taking damage before gaining control of you character is pretty bullshit.
---
Especially considering how volatile the client side session seems to be in the first five minutes after logging in.
---
I've lost my junk to partial load deaths and subsequent crashes countless times. My friend almost quit yesterday because of this, as he was hauling large amounts of bulk junk around on a vendor run.
---
42. Its always on 42
---
And after reading that people were getting so many good 3* I kept doing the event but after like ten times myself and never getting a max level item thought I was just unlucky now at least I don't feel so bad
---
Go east, young man. 
---
I'm not sure about F76 that much (apart from mining companies), but previous games had those stories too and not just Nuka Cola. Pretty much every company in USA was doing fucked up shit with varying degree of "fucked up". They also play better if you read and listen to stories, makes you appreciate the world they created more.
---
Yes but hotfixing few issues VS hot fixing a whole buggy game is different but i hope FO76 will leave early-access this year and i can buy it and enjoy it.
---
yeah thats annoying..i dont understand why ppl would do that..i guess some take the PVP aspect a bit too serious
---
How often do you get sick from drinking the water?
---
Loved your camp design when I visited a few days ago. Great aesthetics!
---
Invisible ghoul, sometimes in the terrain.  I've had it happen with mole rats and Super mutants.  It's a little easier to spot the minigun firing from inside the terrain.
---
I've run two chars through Whitesprings, I haven't had the bots attack me and it didn't happen for either of my friends. Are we talking about Whitesprings or the Whitesprings Bunker? 
---
I think if this was default and intended behaviour for Whitesprings there would be a lot more discussion about it. Could be a bug though. 
---
Man I swear, this one made me laugh :)
---
At a certain level, the majority of mole miners in Welch use combat shotguns.  Great place to farm ammo too.  
---
Amazing thread. I wanted to do one myself but i'll just post here. Yes the tough enemies challenge is hard because you have to deal the killing blow to the queen. Also the megasloth requires you to kill the base version of it,i guess. I killed many variants of megasloth and the challenge doesn't update. It's hard if not impossible to find base versions at high level( can you help finding one?)
---
Now for the c.a.m.p. or workshop challenges in the social tab: it takes 76 then 760 then 7600 but it's fairly easy.
---
All you need is the contractor perk and a workshop. 
---
For the structure challenge you can just keep building and scrapping wooden half-walls. It takes 1 wood and you get 1 back, so you can build about 50 or more with the workshop materials ,and then repaeat.
---
For the  decoration challenge you just need to build a wall and spam a ton of small letters on it. They take 1 steel  and you get 1 back when you scrap them. You can usually put about 100 using only the workshop materials. Store the wall and scrap the letters,then repeat.
---
I didn't do the last challenges as it takes 7600 but it should take 2/3 hours to do them when you get the rhythm.
---
They should hire a hybrid Player - Developer team representative, a sort of MARSUPIAL if u will.
---
This player will not explicitly be over any direct development, but also will be directly connected to development and the idea iteration process as well as communication circulation WITH the playerbase here.
---
I worked for a trio of koreans at a k bbq / american food truck (Way better than panda express, iike that but SO MUCH  BEtter) who deeply needed a translator, not because they didn't or couldn't speak english, but because they needed someone to understand the passion of the cooks and the customers (extremely fanatical fans) to operationally progress and evolve their brand execution.
---
F76 needs this sort of translator. The designers are the koreans here. They made something really amazing that we absolutely love but they aren't able to communicate with the fans at the level needed. They need someone to jump those heights between the players on the ground level here and their dev room. With increased carry weight and higher jumping. A community marsupial if U WILL!
---
I leave this open for nominations.
---
Marsupials Herd, represent!
---
Yeah I play on PC. It tells you the beth username who picked it up.
---
Thanks, I always appreciate the compliments 😁
---
What we should be asking is what the logic is behind level capping mole miners to 40?
---
Cranberry Bog is by far the scariest place in the game. Nope, not because the enemies are hard but because those stationary holes of junk be-gone combined with the fact that you'll be looking up a lot to soak the Scorchbeast sponges to death means you have to be extra wary of the most frightening and by far the most unnecessary hazard in the game. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjm_zmBoxjw
---
Oh God yeah. The game really had a hard-on against crops - especially corn. My CAMPs have all been adhesive farms that I Also use to make soups. EVERY FREAKING TIME I fast travel back to my camp the crops are under attack. Even while I'm there scrapping and crafting they get attacked. Those damn NPCs hate them some fucking corn!
---
There’s a fountain that cures all diseases at ws
---
I think they could just let you "scrap" purified water into boiled water if doing recipe with more than 1 set of ingredients is too much.
---
Where is that option? Is it a different door?
---
Oh sorry. Forgot I was also at flat woods responderbot. In case the other places dont turn it up.
---
Hm. How much clothing do you have stored? Ever crunched the numbers?
---
Also, there's a spacesuit with bellybutton cleavage?! I missed that somehow. 
---
Not that I'd want it. I want cool looking stealth armor &amp; sniper-related stuff. Armor paint that doesn't look like a child puking up candy would be nice too.
---
I build the same way. But, some folks claim the PA glitch trick can get past the foundations.
---
I'm having trouble finding the cat lady's house :(
---
By Morgantown do you mean the general area, or the literal Morgantown icon?
---
I'm currently standing outside the borded up Super Duper Mart, 2-3 cursor boxes (max zoom on world map) south of VTC, it's just to the right of a T-junction. Do you know where it is in relation to that?
---
Pretty sure they can teleport on the roof if there is one grain of soil present.
---
Bounty Hunters are actively engaging in PvP. That means we get to have fun using all possible game mechanics to that end. Players versus Player.
---
If I wasn't broke I'd gild you sir, it's refreshing to see such open-mindedness to being at fault on the interests.
---
Yea this video is garbage 
---
It just doesn't make sense in this area. WS is clearly uncapped, and the thing is 1 minute away running. Just an inconsistency I guess :/
---
No gonna lie I had a good laugh when I first fell into one of those holes. Lost a bit of junk but I've reached the point where I tend to be pretty flush with anything that isn't lead, steel, or flux. One of my fave camp sites is actually in the bog area. The junk pile behind the power station north of Watoga is a cozy spot. Though the re-spawning lvl 91 Deathclaws can be a nuisance. Oh, actually I have a good screenshot of one such nuisance blocking the inner stairs to the second floor of my house.
---
Well in ur scenario pacifist mode worked like it was suppose to. 
---
U killed player, player picked revenge which kept u in pvp mode.  Pacifist or not.  
---
But i agree.  If pacifist mode is on, u shouldnt have to deal with slap damage.  
---
A badass skin for power fists or super sledges, not a boring ass croquet mallet, also rare event outfits should be sold if Bethesda really wants money.
---
if memory serves, you place the door, then select it, edit, and then you have the option for locks
---
It truly is not. The very first online multiplayer games were played this way, almost exclusively. No one logged on to play the deathmatch or campaign co op map options these games shipped with. We logged on in the gamespy server browser to play custom game types and user made maps and modes. We logged on for counter strike and team fortress. That is QUAKEs legacy as one of the original MULTIPLAYER - ONLINE experiences. The USER MADE gameplay.
---
Bethesda could follow the footsteps and succeed, or fail to follow, and consequently deeply fail themselves and their fans.
---
On the upside, I believe there is a challenge for collecting all the diseases... 
---
It's at least partly related to your Endurance
---
Online gaming.  It is what it is.  Any online game will always have those type of players.  
---
Very
---
I'm talking Willy Wonka Golden Ticket valuable
---
I am just going with the basic stuff and hoping for the best. 
---
Been doing this since Beta
---
Bro, you are suffering from blind eye syndrome.
---
Myself, my wife and my friend have all experienced sessions in the last month individually that nearly made us rage quit the game altogether. I came home from work yesterday to my wife nearly in tears because she lost all her junk to a death and disconnect. 
---
I'm the only one of us on reddit.
---
It also showed that their testers had never gone past level 99, nor did they think to test the game with a level 100+ build. 
---
Ah who are we kidding, there weren’t any testers before the BETA soft launch. 
---
Tbh if you lock your doors im breaking in. 
---
I managed to get the full outfit, would you like pictures? And also what's this about a gravestone in ash heap? 
---
My assumption is that it doesn’t and people spreading that are try to deter people from using that building style under the assumption it doesn’t work.
---
Thats the thing, all my friends stopped playing, i have like 110 hours played and i would keep playing but playing alone at this point is just boring
---
Super Villain costumes
---
The ones with the least questions, find the most answers. 
---
Level 3 Wrecking Ball, wanted guy's base, profit.
---
Selling a broken game and subsequently breaking the game further is their fault. Buying the game regardless of the known problems and excusing a company for selling a shoddy product is our fault. Once you are removed from the game it’s kinda funny from the outside. 
---
Got one on 3rd hop, game glitched and changed it to a different mod before I could install. Haven't seen it since. Still salty.
---
I did it on accident during Beta, I tapped collect quickly cause the rads but I became overemcumbered and saw I had 100 dirty water. I swear I only hit the button no more than 10x.
---
If you can find it for $10, sure.
---
"Cloberella, Super King!...and all the rest!"
---
No I join the world and then it crashes. Joined some friends right after they dropped a nuke and well I guess they are good friends because all I got was “that’s really annoying” and then they kicked me from the group.  I’ll admit though I did use it as a weapon once.... I was testing to see if another account would work. And so a level 88 just attacked her(level 6). So I jumped in and crash the server on him. It did feel guilty good. Yes so some of the DCs Monday night and Tuesday morning were me trying to do all the hoops  CS wanted me to do.  I’m going to try some more tonight. So sorry in advance to xbox players but CS has said it a matter of elimination. 
---
yeah...that was more or less their description when they teased it....and now all we get is an popup ingame when we just loaded in
---
Turned on game chat for the first time in weeks last night actually.  "hoooooooomo..... HOMO....  HEY you, F&amp;$@%t!" was literally the first thing I heard.
---
That's at least 85% of why I don't turn it on.
---
Me too. I want to see what's inside. And maybe use the stash or crafting. I'm also picking the lock son the water purifiers, because, they will be full again when they get there anyway. So selfish.
---
You got them too? I named every each one ! Gary Bary lary hary. 
---
Fallout 4 'bug', it's related to the collision mesh of the wall. Happens to a every single item you can mount to walls.
---
I swear someone has rigged up a bot to downvote every new post. Every single one seems to get hit with the initial 0.
---
No clue, but, if you equip the right S.P.E.C.I.A.L. cards, you won't get sick, nor get rads.
---
if we are talking unique Fallout 3 weapons in the 76 universe, I want Fisto!/The Shocker more than anything else 
---
Are you looking to find statues that you stored, or do you want to make them?
---
Some guy nuked my Grafton Steel the other day and then left.
---
Is this really the intent of the PVP system? Bored players griefing for the lulz?
---
Seems like admins could see if that was happening and ban the bot.
---
With a geiger counter in my hand....
---
I'm pretty certain going by this response that you're just trolling.
---
Are you on now? I can paint yours.
---
Same for PC. Not enough people use it and it really does add to the game
---
What the hell is that a wendigo?
---
You can’t destroy foundations, that’s the entire point of this concept, if you could i wouldn’t be posting it.
---
Because loud breathing, chips munching, kids yelling and dogs barking. I only use mic in mp games when i play with friends.
---
I was being cynical on purpose though. I wouldn't mind an extra source of stable fluxes if area is supposed to go away in most half a minute. That's said, it could cause some pvp issues. It's not like I ever pvp but people sometimes try to put some rads on me in many different and creative ways possible before blowing a car or two at nearby.
---
There is not. 
---
Consistent label sizes. Get rid of the thin outline 'colors' and replace with a different pattern. (DPS+ would be red, DPS+ from armor would be red with a white stripe or cross through the middle). And darken the background or your color scheme. Bright neon colors on a white grey background hurts my eyes, and some of the lighter colors would stand out better
---
I totally remember i got shielded raider from the son of dane compound event " scary night" or whatever. It was oger a month ago tho.
---
Boy, this sure doesn't scream horrible design at all.
---
They need to fire the girl intern.
---
Well, it used to be two shot, and explosive, but, since the nerf Bethesda did on them, I think the best weapon mods as of right now are instigating and furious, but don't take my word for it. I'm just  going off of memory. I haven't really played FO76 since December.
---
&gt; I assume that it was just an oversight that never got corrected. Like how recipes call for Pure Flux but the name is actually Stable Flux (or the other way around, I don't remember.) Silly mistake, easy to fix, nothing has been done. Same goes for all the spelling mistakes that have been around for a quarter of a year.
---
Doesn't appear to be a mistake since they specifically made a filter that let's you sort by sources of a given material under those superfluous names like Pure Flux which list the raw material as a subcategory. Apparently they didn't get the memo that it's still completely stupid design that only serves to confuse users who expect crafting materials to have straightforward naming conventions that don't have an obsolete super-category for raw materials and the materials that scrap into said raw material since that's needlessly redundant.
---
For which weapon and what build?
---
I still have 3. This was pre patch when the only thing anyone did was nuke whitesprings. To put it into perspective I haven't done any real quests. Me my friends I played with during the beta hit lvl 30 around that time and then once it was full release did nothing but farm gear from whitesprings, uranium fever, workshops, and killing the queen (whenever we could on that last part). I gave the other three away to friends and one random. I still have Tse gauss, Tse 50 cal and Tse prime lmg. I gave away the shotguns after using them for the majority of my play time. 
---
I like it but what do we call it when they come back? Maybe they just left Appalachia to explore works as a better explanation?
---
How did you get yours to work?
---
I've played every Metro game so far, I had 2033 before Last Light had even been announced. Both 2033 and Last Light are games that I can plat from start to finish in once sitting if I wanted to, but they're both amazing games, which I bought for a second time for the redux versions when they released on X1.
---
Bioshock games are another good example of great singleplayer games that aren't a hundred hours long but were still well worth full price when I bought them. Prey and Doom were both fantastic games as well, neither of those were very long but they still felt well worth spending $80 to get them on launch day. Just because a game isn't long doesn't mean it won't be worth the cost.
---
Even with a relatively short story mode, if the game is good enough you'll probably play it more than once. I did with the last two Metro games, and I know I will with Exodus too. I beat Prey twice, and Doom 2016 three times. I felt more satisfied with those games than I ever did with Fallout 76.
---
So if the consensus is to not accept invites from strangers, why is it allowed?
---
An ok lvl 40 legendary is better than most lvl 50 weapons.
---
But I really like this chat and have spent 3 months grinding stuff. This “oh at anytime you can loose everything you have worked on”will kill a game. Granted it seems this game is in its death throws.  If Bethesda wants to give me a ton of gold and atoms in exchange for my characters death by bad coding ok, otherwise I’ll just keep spending hours testing to see if I can somehow fix it  until I either fix it or Bethesda does. 
---
No it's just me.
---
Yeah and pop a Rad-X for good measure.
---
Speaking with someone could lead to a lot hilarious moments and it wouldn’t be so kind of boring just running around and use emotes 
---
LMAO right, they should've kept the blackbird up too, obviously I want it but still you give time to people to buy it, once they expend their atoms pump out other cool shot to "incentivise" people to spend a few bucks, they're totally flopping imo
---
Fisto! is amazing. But my favorite fisting apparatus will always be the Ballistic Fist. It'd be neat if they somehow made it a proper hybrid melee/ballistic weapon that let you punch shotgun shells into your enemies. 
---
Also, I miss the lil' [.32 "pistol" revolver](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/.32_pistol_\(Fallout_3\)). It was dinky as hell, but I love the break-top action and sound it made. Plus I bet it'd find a way to be viable with the new weapon-modding features. 
---
Goin out to stake me some government land.....
---
What is that mask/helmet in pic 4? and is pic 3 stitched together or is that really 3 SBs in what looks like a stop motion performance? These are some of the most interesting shots ive seen so far
---
I'm glad you stuck by your word.  I was actually hoping to be proven wrong, as it had been quite some time since I had ran the event myself.  If it actually dropped max level loot, I would happily be grinding it again for drops.  But kudos and thanks for going back and forth with me.😉
---
Sometimes people drop stuff, you don't always know if it was on purpose or not. They would need to remove the drop item feature. 
---
Hah, I didn't know that!
---
You drink somebody's dirty-ass bathwater? Is it that super blue stuff? Just too many things are off about that for me to do it. Calgon take me away! 
---
Hey, you were nothing but polite and friendly. Kudos to you too :)
---
Pity you're on XBone, would enjoy some adventuring with you, I reckon :)
---
Maybe they missed that part, it seems to happen a lot. I've posted many times. And may have done it myself. you only read something and miss the key words lol. So yeah not grieving IF it's BH active. THEN you would be a KING of SAW.
---
Honestly, I think we should just stop talking about this before Bethesda fixes the event by nerfing the legendary drops to level 15.
---
Well the game as it stands has no end game grind already. I do quests, kill queen, shop for gear on reddit, kill things with new guns. End. Sadly, I love fallout and have played too many hrs I'll never get back in all the old ones, even 4. But I think with a revision to this, it would prolong end play than kill it. Right now if you want a new legendary you type hey H this W that and buy it. Only thing you do to extend that is farm caps to buy items. Now youd have to unlock perks to apply/break down legendaries that you might not have. All the prefixes, major and minor effects to make a weapon you want or armor. All those crap legendaries that almost no one or a slim few use wont be turned into bags on the floor just to be forgotten. I've found soo many dropped items from farming and collected them just to try and sell. But limited to 1400 caps per 20hrs or so and usually end up dropping the rest anyway
---
They would need to recode or completely remove the ability to drop items on purpose.
---
I'm on PC, but thank you!
---
This is a great idea, I vote yes
---
Yes, my GT is Xwolfpackleader 
---
Likewise.  Would be fun to have some fun with a game I've been taking too seriously lately.
---
Agree, so they will need to put a warning on death drops or completely remove dropping items on purpose.
---
The apostrophe is a pain. I ended up placing it out of line with the text, went between / above the letters it is used in.
---
For ref: [https://imgur.com/axbUaId](https://imgur.com/axbUaId)
---
It is really sad that we are the ones that have to find and report these blatant issues.
---
To be fair, this game is already in a death spiral
---
If you’re on a team, and within a certain proximity, all do should be shared
---
On vacation visiting friends in Diamond City. I'll send you a postcard
---
Well, now that we know you are fallible, how do we know that *this* just isn't wrong too?? I just don't know *what* to believe anymore!
---
Seriously, there's a derth of content, and the fact that they keep nerfing what content there is is...problematic. "Events are to rewarding. Let's fix that. Ghoul farming is too rewarding, lets nerf that. Mole miners at uranium fever is super popular! Let's nerf that!" 
---
Now it's..daily challenges for atoms I probably won't ever have anything I actually want to spend them on, primarily because I have a sister who plays this game who DOES. 
---
Open world exploration is pretty much the only charm this game has for me at this point, which is, if I'm going to be honest, the only thing I've never had a complaint about with bethesda games. 
---
what event?
---
What event, and any chance you have a screen cap or vid? 
---
I could make you a lvl 20 gauss rifle and combat rifle and mod it if you'd like.
---
I’ve traded for it. But wasn’t sure how rare it was.
---
Gotten several Vanguard pieces and multiple bomber jackets.
---
My friend got the BoS recon rifle plans.
---
Because I had the nerve to disagree with someone and point out that their statement is bullshit. It happens a lot around here. 
---
Also if the turrets fire on me, they're going down. How's that for honesty? I might leave some little communist propaganda in the purifiers next time, so there won't even be any water there when they get back.
---
oh nice, if you want to sell it and are on ps4 let me know
---
It is. I’m just trying to go back and get any quests I’ve missed (starting to get bored at lvl 75). Looks like I skipped over this one and there’s no way to go back &amp; trigger it.
---
I kept running it after seeing all the hype and always got lower level garbage. Figured I was just unlucky.
---
Oh well, back to Whitesprings and Watoga like every other person on every server I guess.
---
dont call it a pew pew, someone new to the game is gonna go buy those plans from a vendor and realize "short pew" isn't a weapon 
---
I'm pretty certain you feel that way because you're unwilling or unable to respond point-for-point. My money on the latter.
---
Get back to me when you have a valid counter-argument.
---
We're succumbing to The Blight and have joined the rank of the Scorched.
---
I don’t use my mic (actually don’t know if I even have one) because I’m still playing this like the other fallout games before it. I’d have to think many others that have been hooked for years are in the same boat. Not saying it’s right or wrong, just saying. 
---
I thought balls was "Eier"
---
Personally with about 150+ hours in the game, all my friends leaving the game, and my general view of the game. I accept random invites because its the only fun i seem to have any more in a game i really do enjoy. My favorite thing to do is help out the newer members of the community and I've made tons of friends from all around the world doing this. 
---
I have a 1* two shot fat man ps4. Can say honestly the mirv launcher seems smaller then just a plain two shot
---
OP deserve a Upvote, honestly. 
---
Pretty hard to get into character when your house disappears. We're living in a simulation
---
Did FO76 launch on the Nintendo 64?
---
Don't bother with these morons that keep blindly defending this insult of a game.
---
Why? It would be like 20 feet. 
---
OMG?!
---
I left and went back home to Chernarus.
---
That item is labeled "medical helmet." You can find it at Appalachian Antiques NW of Watoga. May have to hop a few times, and that same place spawns the flight helmet (only seen it spawn once), brotherhood fatigues and lab coat.
---
Pic 3 is "live". Taken at Abandoned Bog Town's Workshop, just a couple meters north of the acid spawn. Mutants were bugged, and those 3 SBs were flying around. Normally only 1 SB spawns, but sometimes 3 show up and generally are not aggro for a good long while (15 or 20 mins). Glad you like the pics!
---
You interested in selling it? If not that's fine. Also did you get pre patch or after?
---
Don't worry, 'going downhill' still means you have a really nice view over Fallout 76, which is at the bottom of the mountain in a ditch.
---
If I remember correctly I got it from Dropped Connection at Harpers Ferry. I could be wrong.
---
He has been my Lord and Savior (hence the user name) since 1990. Unfortunately, by the time I got into metal at the ripe old age of 10, he was already gone. But, there will never be another person like him. 
---
Screws. The hunt for screws never changes.
---
honestly I think they should get rid of the random attacks on camps or upgrade the turrets system 
---
I find the best way to protect corn and farming items is to drop a tent then place the crops under it as then enemies spawn and hit the tent a few times first keeping you from losing a ton of corn....
---
i did not say "balls"
---
Imagine that you build a square/rectangle shape with foundations but remove the 4 corner pieces (thinking it is still secure) it results in a thin area that may be open to glitches.  Needs testing and I hope you can understand the theory.  By leaving all the foundations in the square, there are no weak points, maybe?   This is my default building style and have only heard these rumors,  but I want to make sure it is totally secure. 
---
Have you ever seen what happens to your screen when you're sitting at ground zero?
---
I'm going to chalk this up as another typo.
---
Seriously getting tired of us having to point out obvious clerical errors in the game.
---
Blows my mind that those associated with the game's development don't touch the game themselves.
---
I have one that I would be willing to sell you.
---
I also place the corner block... this ain’t not nether portal...
---
There’s red death claws?
---
I'm just joking guys jeez.
---
In what way is that relevant to any of the points I've made?
---
1. My argument isn't that bugs and problems don't exist.
---
2. My argument IS that this person is exaggerating the bugs with a misleading title to get clicks, and that the video is giving no new information. 
---
3. How you respond to a video game has nothing to do with the video game. Again, that's not an argument that the game isn't flawed, or that bugs don't exist. It's an argument that your 'rage' response and your wife's 'almost in tears' response are about you and your emotions, not the game. It's entirely normal to get frustrated at times; but when video games are bringing you to anger or tears you need to acknowledge where the conflict is really coming from and work on that. Most people do not have that kind of response to a form of entertainment. No insult intended on this point either, as I had anger problems for awhile when I was younger. It's just not fair to blame an external object for the degree of your response to that object.
---
I'm not suffering from blind eye syndrome, I'm just expressing my disapproval of the value of this video. As I have already said, that doesn't mean I'm not aware of problems in 76.
---
Sorry man.  Xbox
---
I appreciated the joke lol
---
I finally found it!  Almost halfway between  Bolton Greens &amp; Morgantown High School.
---
Is it one of a few cat houses?
---
Damn, thanks anyways 
---
You could try fallout bazaar or fallout market. People will probably sell them for pretty cheap.
---
Same here. I've found that finding the center and working both ways in, or going from right to left will help some.
---
Player chose revenge, which kept you in pvp no matter the pacifist mode. Similar to claiming a workshop or being on a team with a pvper, pacifist mode can be overrun.
---
I would be unfair for people to be able to avoid revenge by engaging pacifist mode as you attempted to do.
---
I tend to shoot at cars as i'm walking along just for something to do... sorry for all those that do that to you.
---
I use my mic. But I use the xbox party chat system which mutes the game chat. Why? Because the game chat system is as buggy as the servers themselves. My audio will routinely stop working and not come back until the party server Hops. Or it's just so damn quiet that you can't hear each other. When we switch to party chat mode it just works. It sucks though because then I can't talk to others. Not a huge problem though when most of the time other players are just looking to stab me 1000 times with their death deathclaws and whatever instagib melee meta of the day is. 
---
This is why I'm still on this sub. I haven't even played 76 yet. I was broke when it came out and kids come before games. I hope it gets better too because i was hoping for it to be awesome. 
---
true
---
I want to say I got it after. An sure on psn merlance
---
I don't think there's too few bullets. 
---
Not enough real bollocks, definitely. 
---
Common Serenity Lane problem.  Some people refuse to accept the programming.  Entire crops have been lost.
---
Yeah I've been on that sub before. I really wasn't too interested in buying them, i was just wondering if they can still be found in game as a drop, post tse nerf patch. But if the offer came around....
---
Ah very good, thank you.
---
Whoa
---
this way players could get rare fluxes without having to launch an entire nuke.
---
Nice idea. But that's never going to happen 
---
How much would you sell it for? 
---
Pc.
---
Guides don't really have any relevance when anyone can just look at the game files and find the truth of the matter with publicly available tools.
---
I have no doubt that it was intended to be affected by normal 2H perks.  I haven't checked to see if it was patched, but at the time of writing, it did not have the appropriate weapon keywords to be affected by them (and this was demonstrably true in-game, too).
---
The ammo types in F:NV all worked exactly as implemented aside from some issues with shotguns as I remember, it's just that most enemies weren't ridiculous bullet sponges so it didn't matter.
---
And in general you just used the ammo+ from hand loader that was pretty much just always the best option because of free armor piercing and increased damage, usually higher accuracy as well.
---
And uh, no the current system Bethesda has is definitely bad seeing as only high damage per single hit weapons are any good, and anything based around a bunch of small hits very fast is bad.
---
So no, the Bethesda system is very much not the best.
---
500?
---
You get it, man. Bloviate harder. That's it. That's it. ... and once you learn the rules to debate....  like your straw man example....... the internet is your oyster and 4chan is waiting for you.
---
yeah that scares me..it only happened to me once where i got killed and then Disconnected which meant i was gone from the server and junk is gone forever..i have been good at stashing my junk recently..especially in the tough areas...whenever i would farm flora in the cranberry bog..the scorchbeast always killed me..so i no to always stop at the stash box at watoga
---
500 caps?
---
I thought so too.
---
3 heck I'm just missing an arm I was him a just use it for crafting but everyone seems to be running low health builds
---
Sounds good to me, ill add you on psn, when will you be on im about to get on now.
---
But that gives purified water, not dirty water for boiling then cooking with.  I need boiled water for my insane menu
---
Yup. The race car bed is cool, but the pink castle bed is so unrealistic!
---
Seriously, though, it'd be better for everyone if more faction themes made it into the shop, in addition to what they're currently offering. I just wish dudes would stop shitting on anything that is overtly feminine. 
---
i think two patches ago is when the newer enemies started showing up at WS
---
He complained about grinding not despawns, two very different things.
---
I'm sorry that you're upset about not having the best gear drop for you right away, but seeing as the loot table is large that's to be expected. 
---
I'm facing the same issues mate, but you don't see me having a sook over not being OP.
---
I do agree about it being online survival mode though, much more accurate title.
---
Good man. I would have called you out too had I seen the post. I only ever did it for that one Plan once I realized that (don't even recall which one it is anymore). But. Takes someone strong to eat their own sh\*t in front of everybody. Also, dude, TMI.
---
Yes! Taking a step back now :)
---
While I will readily agree most UF items are level 40 &amp; below, I have on several occasions gotten better from there, including a level 45 TSE Handmade.
---
I have also noticed that if doing UF with other players, the loot seems to scale to the lowest level, unlike the Ghouls in WS.
---
For reference I've done Uranium Fever about 200 times +/-
---
Nope. Too much potential to give greifers wet dreams.
---
I'd take an improvement on making it more damaging as it is currently shittier than explosive guns
---
Haha dammit how do I win!!
---
Together.... always
---
Just started. But so far love it.
---
But meanwhile, I got EVERY other mod. 
---
Dont drop your bag in the first place ;-)
---
You think i can handle it being level 20
---
Thanks appreciate it
---
On now
---
I would appreciate that 
---
It is absolutely insulting. 
---
For you to say that NOTHING can be s catalyst for emotion other that that person's "mental illnesses" is insulting as fuck.
---
Get fucked dude.
---
You went from a white knight to a complete piece of shit.
---
Bought it on Steam for $5 a while back. Still need to give it a go. Decided for $5 it isn't a big loss if I don't enjoy it.
---
I love all the Nuka Girl ads. Nuka Girl PA paint would be fantastic.
---
I got one before and after the nerf. 
---
There are so many examples of quality of life issues that can be pointed out by anyone who spends any time playing the game.  It certainly has to be that either they aren't playing their own game or they don't care or don't have the resources to make changes on this stuff.  I mean a lot of this stuff seems pretty simple.
---
Sorry, a counter-argument requires there to be an argument in the first place.
---
Your entire gimmick has been saying "bUt MoSt PlAyErS wOnT NoTiCe!" when if you had watched the video you would see that it is filled with three hours of glitches that are either;
---
A. Gamebreaking in a fundemental way or,
---
B. Extremely visually striking and noticable.
---
They were hostile towards me the very first time I went to whitesprings back during the beta but havent been hostile towards me since and I dont know what changed
---
My friends and I are always on mic.
---
We go to group chat using the view key shortcut if others are around we want to talk with.
---
They nerfed it a month or so back. It's one of the many, many bad decisions made by this dev team. Every "balance change" of note has been a nerf that negatively affects game-play.   
---
There was a time when uranium fever DID drop level 50 gear.  I got in a few runs back then and it was fun, now there's no real reason to do the event at all, unless you happen to need an event/titanium scrap. 
---
Don't pretend you don't know.
---
Yea we know we’ve been playing it
---
official testers? xDD They don't even invest money for more developers...How do you expect them to hire people for official bug testing?
---
He calls the loading screen a glitch/bug. His opinion is trash. We could stare at a black screen the entire time instead. I stopped watching the moment he made the loading screen his first point. Wasted his own time making that, and anyone’s time that was willing to sit through it. 
---
That makes sense — on several levels, actually (and sadly).
---
No mods on xbox and I already reinstalled (lost all my picts including this awesome one posing with a ghoul frozen in mid air while doing a backflip and my friends all standing around the first scorch beast we took down. 
---
Blame the game, not the dupers. The players will fit whatever form the environment gives them. The environment had a lot of bugs and problems. From a design side, you plan for a worst case scenario in a worst case application. People were people, its the game developers responsibility to mitigate that with active and passive checks.
---
I respect locks (i.e., they don't trigger me to a griefer rage).
---
I sort of resent them, though, unless it's maybe on a (non-water purifier) resource extractor.
---
Hey, you could do a lot to fix this problem by naming loot bags. Sometimes it's intentional theft, sometimes it's an event zone where a lot of people die and your quest market system \_frequently\_ fails to work to target the right bag.   
---
I've had my stuff stolen, and I've stolen other players junk, simply because the \_bags aren't labeled\_. No malice involved. 
---
I wore out at least a couple cassettes of Master Of Puppets and Ride The Lightning myself :) By the time And Justice For All came out, I had mowed enough lawns to get a CD player. 
---
Except it quite literally did bug out visually.
---
They’re doing some kind of maintenance tomorrow and will be shutting it down for several hours
---
You can scrap junk in FO4 if you're willing to throw it down and do each piece individually. That's how you I've been playing for years. Scrap is what gets shared between your settlements if you set up supply routes. Tedious, yes, but it works. 
---
To give another viewpoint (and basically agree with you), if it was *safe* to care about my CAMP, I *would*care about my CAMP. But doing chores like rebuilding is no fun at all. I am basically totally unwilling to risk an elaborate CAMP needing to be redone, so my CAMP is one step above a homeless guy's refrigerator box. 
---
If they didn't Nerf it to death you'd see other comments on different things :-)
---
gonna be a lot of sour posts on here from people who bought items from eBay tomorrow 
---
I can hear the rage quits already.
---
I fucking hope so
---
Buddy got one last night.  He was excited, but I know how poor fatmans (fatmen) are currently. 
---
I'm still here. I am hiding in bravo silo with a 1200 cap bounty. 👍
---
Could use some place like one of the old blast zones, where the whole crater is irradiated. Don't think you can fast travel taking rad damage. So then they can't even get out that way.
---
This SHOULD be totally fine, if all goes well and no innocents are affected. Why do I sense some impending doom?...
---
No kidding.  It's going to be salt city up in here.
---
Um, no they wouldn't.
---
There's player unique items in the game. IE, Things I can't see but another player can.
---
Wouldn't be too hard (well we are talking about Bethesda here) to programme something where should you die outside of PvP your loot can only be seen by you/your party for 5/10 minutes, then after that it appears for everyone.
---
Maxson’s coat.
---
Or traded from people having no idea the items were duped
---
I am starting to think that my issue is not as much with the stash limit as it is with carry weight. The fact that you have to devote such a huge portion of your character to be able to even maintain a decent carry weight and/or weight reduction. 
---
I  have recently started taking a hard look at my stash and it is rarely full. The items I am carrying tend to be the issue. With the requirement for food/water as well as the general lack of protection requiring constant stim/healing...it is just too much. 
---
As for the cap limit, I want a single cap limit of 1000 for all vendors. I don't want to have to travel to umpteen vendors around the map so I am able to sell my junk and get the max amount. 
---
I can sort of see why the vendor does not have the same amount as items were bought for, but it sure would be nice if it was higher than 25%.
---
This gunna hurt bad....
---
*insert elmo with fire in the background gif here when all the dupe-tubers and fallout 76 news youtubers all make the same 10 minute and 1 second video about this*
---
I bet a lot of people who were anti-duping may feel a bit differently once there favorite weapon vanishes 
---
Because people will claim innocence, no matter what.
---
Let's hope after the last patch they triple checked value changes this time around 
---
this one time I'm kinda glad I didn't trade anything 
---
And all the people that don’t know they have a duped item will be pissed
---
Honestly that's probably the first thing I've been even remotely tempted by in a while... Though like, all of the wall art kinda goes together to make a halfway decent bar. 
---
No thanks !  But appreciate it. 
---
Buying items on eBay is not wise. Paying real world money for virtual items.
---
Let the buyer beware.
---
I kept my level 5 tse shotgun until I got a level 45 handmade. At level 120 something. Now I've passed it on to another character to level up, but post nerfing it isn't really worth it. 
---
I had a tons of excess boiled water and i saw a guy still in the vault so i decided to pass some along. I waited outside (in PA btw) and he walks out looks at me at just started punching me i wasnt even mad i just droped the water then he realized i wasnt there to be a bully. Idk if he thought he had a chance or what but i thought it was funny.
---
This is, incidentally, despite what this subreddit may say, why critics are important.  They let you make informed decisions about the nature of the media you buy.
---
Big mistake 
---
Here is the problem with this. Someone works hard buys something not knowing it was duped and you don't replace the hard earned caps.
---
goodbye TSEs
---
So...basically, if we have a god tier gun, it's gone?
---
I mean I'm glad you enjoyed the game, but your judgement can't be trusted. You are \_so far\_ outside the bell curve for average consumer your input is pretty much useless, statistically.   
---
I'll also point out that, this game? You can "beat" in under twenty hours. Every bethesda fallout out there can be "beaten" in under 20 hours. The core story line in bethesda fallout games are, inevitably, short. 
---
Awesome, thanks for the reply back!
---
Well, I can't doubt what you saw, but I've certainly seen the Queen flying around with pretty much everything crippled.
---
I'm a developer and we are behind on our release schedule, We did a partial release last spring--servers crashed customers lit up Customer service so Managment pulled it for another year with the intent to do a full release this spring. Afterwards upper management decided to bring in 6-10 additional offshore teams to "help us" meet our new DEADline. At lunch today one of our two leads was complaining about the code they are trying to commit and it had 86 failures in the code review including 10 critical that would break other things. And are lead who did the review refuses to pass it till they get it fix. And they are complaining that he is the roadblock to them getting their work done in a timely fashion. So I am guessing next couple of days are going to be  "fix the code now" or "fix it in production"..... Experience really makes me hope management will choose the first but I would put $$ down it will be the second. 
---
Woo! 
---
And I just said I was looking for ultracite shocks. Not sure what you point is? 
---
The lore definitely talks about time travel.
---
There were people that didn’t buy things on eBay that have no idea they have a duped item
---
Not sure.  I know there was a cat house in Fallout 4 though.
---
Great stuff 😂😂😂
---
u need a nuke zone..also fissure site..is the best for violet
---
How would it give griefers more potential? it only effects it's damage it reduced significantly for the trade off of creating flux.
---
They messed up this game sooo bad wow. Couldn’t fix their own mistakes or even put out new content so now they’re taking things away from players. I’m sure a lot of ppl don’t even know if they have a duped items and if they lose it then they lost out on the caps spent or guns and armor traded for the item. 
---
Darn alright
---
I sold that game after 4 hours. Not gonna lie, it was overhyped af and boring as hell. 
---
Real question though...are a lot of us who just buy and sell weapons through the various subs going to lose some of our weapons? I bought an AAE Handmade two weeks ago and I love it. I started using it after my TSE Gauss was nerfed.
---
Never understood trading with folks you don't know.
---
Then again, I came here from Fortnite Save the World, where screams of "TRADE PRESS 123 - 4 GOLDSCAR!!!
---
They need to put some serious work into this system. They need to not only allow you to choose to only join worlds your camp can place...but also allow you to pre-queue with a group, so ALL of your camps can place in the same world.   
---
Me and my sister play together a lot.  I build on a small pond and she builds on a lead node. We have to server hop three-five times, on average, to find a server where both of our camps can place.   
---
And, add to that, make it so if you LEAVE a world, you can choose NOT to go back to that exact world. I've been placed back in the same exact world multiple times which I've left because I can't place my camp. 
---
If you made this post when the game had just come out you would be downvoted to hell.
---
All those people that were using godly melee weapons while laughing at the TSE nerfs are gonna be mad tomorrow when their shit disappears too.
---
But they look clean and tidy to us perfectionists XD
---
"Search Reddit" is your friend.
---
Kekekeke
---
Right?! Man, I'm gonna be pissed if my AAE Handmade is gone. I havent seen many, so I hope its not duped :(.
---
If you know they are duped then your can't go crying when they remove them. 
---
Ill gotten gains and all. 
---
No. 
---
no, i wouldn’t,  because i’m trying to have fun at the expense of bounty hunters, not kill people in a death trap.
---
didn't think the posts would start before the items were even removed 
---
You clearly dont understand what the words glitch or bug means. 
---
This would be awesome, if the game was stable enough for it, and if nuke zones didn't destroy connectivity for people on lesser connections. There's no real REASON for either of these issues, beyond "bethesda" though. 
---
The collateral damage might be the death knell for this game. 
---
Me too, for this reason. 
---
This better be done right... i spent 2k caps for a TSE shotgun literally 2 days before the nerf.
---
If i lose the shotgun, and the caps whilst the person i bought from keeps said caps i’ll be pissed, and i imagine alot of players will.
---
This REALLY should have been done during the duping period, not weeks afterwords when said items have been in circulation with people spending time to trade an item only to have it be fucking removed.
---
That would mean I would need to wear a headset. I like using my home theater 
---
It's going to be a bloodbath.
---
The rage is going to be through the roof. They can't just delete the stuff from duper accounts. They are going to punish thousands of innocent people who bought items from out of game markets with CAPS.  
---
Basically, folks are going to get punished for something they didn't do.
---
Saying that it’s because we don’t have to pay for dlc is hardly an excuse seeing as the game I payed full price for isn’t even finished to begin with. 
---
On another note, we shouldn’t be begging for new atom shop items. There’s absolutely now reason I should have to pay 10$ for armor stands when that’s twice the cost of the original dlc it came with in fo4. I personally believe everything currently in the atom shop should be free due to the piss poor launch and the absolute awful communication with the community. 
---
lol!
---
Even if it’s someone you know, there is no provenance on what they gave you. 
---
I tended to forget that number, until I embroidered it on my towel.
---
Jesus christ some of the playerbase for this game is equally as incompetent as bethesda. 
---
Yeah, which is why I went out of my way to avoid the stacked inventories, as I said, some people had. I did everything in my power to avoid dupes, but can't be sure they aren't duped.
---
I'll probably end up losing a couple, it's a bummer but I get it.... but it's the massive amount of people who don't know what's up I'm talking about. They're gonna log in to see their shit missing, not know why, and it's gonna go badly.
---
The only advantage I care about from the quick view pip boy is actually being able to read my screen
---
Yep. Guess it really will be a dead game after all. Because unless the whole loot system is overhauled along with it, then people aren't going to be grinding Whitespring for trash. Everyone has had it with that. And Division 2 and Anthem are just around the corner. But c'est la vie. They sure know how to fuck up spectacularly.
---
If you spent your hard earned caps on an item from another player, knowing item duplication could have been a possible means to obtain the item you're buying, you took a risk.
---
I got mine from doing the power plant events, it rewards you with one generator plan you don't have each time IIRC
---
Yep, I turned mine on last night and the first person I came across spent all his time making meaningless noises while his kid cried in the background. No thanks.
---
Haha losing my stuff was only a catalyst to the idea itself. When I saw "Another player has taken your dropped bag" I wanted to know who it was. I could have tried to take them both on, you're right about that. But then to one person it would have just looked like I killed them to take their junk too. Also, if this were about losing junk it would probably be toned a lot different and say something along the lines of "make death bags unlootable by other players" instead, I think it would be fun to say "THAT LITTLE BASTARD! IM COMING FOR YOOOOUUUUUU!" 
---
Yeah, that's what I'm worried about. They say they don't think it's the vast majority of accounts, but a casual play of the game shows a LOT of people probably have this stuff.
---
I think this is gonna go poorly.
---
that's what it sounds like.
---
I mean in theory, I'm enthused. In practice...it's bethesda. I don't see this going well. 
---
There is if you associate with people who won't do shady' cheating garbage.
---
That is what I just said
---
I believe I did receive a meat hook that was lvl 45 last night, 2 star.
---
Call me Peanut Butter and Jealous! 
---
Ya, thought I was the only one who figured out how it works lol.
---
Been chaining technical data out of military wing desks every day for weeks now.
---
How can you know, when you buy a single item or two from a random player, that it is, or isn't duped?

As someone who has done a fair amount of trading on the forums with legit earned caps/items, this could be a deal breaker for me as I've replaced and sold off items only keeping the better items.  If weight management didn't penalize me for clearing out unused legendaries I'd still be golden.  I guess we'll just have to see tmrw.
---
For a whole lot less effort Bethesda could take a step in this direction by having drop-in monster NPCs. When you log in instead of playing a character you have the option of playing a pre-rolled monster (Scorched, Mole Miner, Super Mutant, Protectron, etc. Maybe not the big beasties.) You get a posse of support monsters. You get dropped into an appropriate zone, and your job is to wreak havoc until the PC's put you down. Make it an event on the map. Give the monster players the ability to see PC's on the map even if they're crouching, and unlimited fast travel if they're not near a PC. Maybe restrict the fast travel to level appropriate zones.
---
In return for your service as a punching bag-slash-elite, thinking enemy you get some Atoms to spend at the store, or some caps dumped on your PC character, or some other reward. But I think people would do it just for the fun of it. It's guilt-free griefing, because you're supposed to go tear things up. That's your job. No worrying about inventory or crafting or weapon breakage or earning XP or eating or drinking or caps or rads or.... Just Destroy All Humans.
---
Probably it would be best if you were unable to switch out equipment from your initial load. Otherwise you'd have people teaming up to give you the usual assortment of overpowered weapons and such instead of having to improvise with what the Gods of the Wasteland give you. But it's also an opportunity for Bethesda to put in fun, different weapons that they know can't end up in PC hands.
---
Buyer beware. 
---
Of course. Even now there's a lot of people who are just mindlessly dismissing it without even having tried to watch a bit of it because it's negative coverage of the game. 
---
I've been around games (mostly Kickstarter titles) where after they fail their core fanbase leaves, with those remaining turning into vitrol spewing white knights.
---
One of many, many reasons I haven't touched the 3'd party unofficial market. 99.999% of everything listed is duped. You're probably fucked.   
---
That, and the sheer number of "I got destroyed/robbed/etc by a griefer" stories. 
---
What's going on?
---
You know I am ready to leave this game behind. It sucks I should have left already I said I was going to and didn't. I'm kinda happy about this and hope I lose some weapons. Maybe I'll make a video of me deleting my characters so I can finally walk away. 
---
God, I hate those. Took me forever to get the fusion generator.
---
Well, just yesterday I came back after two months and finally bought a TSE 90% weight-reduced pump shotgun. Here's to hoping I didn't give away my bloodied grog axe +4k caps for nothing....
---
...you should have built this over some scorch beast piles...
---
Yet you have no way of knowing this if you don't keep up to date with news of this game. You're not obligated to read Reddit or articles about the game.
---
There should be absolutely NO RISK involved in trading whatsoever, because duping should have been fixed the day or a day after it was found out.
---
Some players think if you trade you are auto buying from dupers especially at a train station, the other day i was gifting a player flux at white spring station there was a player staring at us, after i went to go sell my stuff for daily caps run and just after he came and killed me and said that is what i get for buying duped stuff lol i was gifting flux, he was gone by the time i spawned, later i was at a workshop for fusion cores and same guy came and killed me again. I sent him a friend request the next day and he accepted. Might take revenge on him... 
---
Software Engineer here, my guess is that the development team working on FO76 inherited the 'fallout' framework from Fallout 4. Then they added this multiplayer layer on top of it, which caused many issues but they obviously have deadlines (funding is not infinite) &amp; were told to release the game. Now, I imagine they are working on cleaning up their sloppy multiplayer layer or trying to re-write some of the base framework to better handle all the additional features they'd like to implement, hence why we get no communication (companies rather stay silent then admit fault, as do most human-beings).
---
I wouldn't expect any huge changes for at least a few months, and I'm sure they would like to stand up some test servers once they get to a point of general stability. Additionally they ARE under-staffed, as are most companies because there are not nearly enough coders out there in the working world. Patience my children of atom.
---
punishing buyers - unless they made some RL transaction out of game  (in which case, you are getting what you deserve)  - is the wrong answer.
---
With no way to tell if an item is duped, thousands are going to be punished for simply making a transaction in game with another player.
---
That's pretty fucked.
---
I don't want to talk to strangers. Don't even want to team up either. I play a single player game.
---
They made a post about incoming down time tomorrow where they'll be purging duped weapons, and I'm finding myself concerned that they woefully underestimated how prevalent that has become, even amongst those who tried to avoid duper salesmen.
---
Excavator also sold by Vendor Greg in Grafton btw
---
Nice trick. I'm sure it will be "fixed" in the next patch...
---
gotcha, that's odd but hey violently arbitrary decisions seem like the norm around these parts so I guess its working as intended!
---
Game breaking! Totally unplayable because of it!
---
To be honest you play an online game 
---
They are going to fuck something up. 100% chance.
---
Maaaan. I've never duped, and it's taken me soooo goddamn long of buying, selling, and trading my way up to my endgame gear.
---
I'm writing down/screenshotting my favourite stuff tonight. I hope to god it's there after work tomorrow.
---
Fuck, man.
---
umm...  the stargate was used for time travel as well...
---
this is Bethesda. You think it'll be done right?
---
11 runs in one day?  How many hours 
---
Or better yet, have all recipes prepared in camp just count as "having boiled water" if you have a pump or purifier. Also, it makes no sense needing "boiled water" in a recipe when you have to cook the recipe again. So you have to use wood to boil the water, and then use wood again to boil the tea/soup. It should just take any kind of water, since you're going to boil it again anyway.
---
Instigating is really nice. I have it on a handmade and also a lever action rifle. Plus, the lever action does an additional 50% to limbs, so it's my sneak-sniper at the moment. The handmade is for more close and personal work.
---
That was my first thought, guarantee it would create another huge server crash glitch plus I bet it would open another method for duppers.
---
You must be new here. Welcome to the sub! /s
---
Heh, one can dream right?
---
Because some of us do accept invites from randos. Roll how you wanna roll. 
---
I'm still so mad about how this quest works...when I did this the first time, as a honey fresh newbie..I dumped like \_50\_ in at one go, because it never even occurred to me that they'd bethesda this quest up so badly. 
---
The moment that I learned Duping was happening, I stopped even accepting strangers requesting trades.
---
I insulated myself from having any possible issues in the future.
---
Make mad decisions, have bad consequences.
---
lol ppl really overthink things
---
With no way to identify a dupe from a non-dupe, there is exactly NO WAY a buyer could know.
---
I go just for the steel.
---
It's actually raspberry flavor.
---
what makes you think they won't be duping after tomorrow?
---
Can’t wait to see all the “wah Bethesda deleted my collection of 500 Anti-Armor Explosive pumps, I’m just an entrepreneur!” posts and comments
---
nuke zones in CAMPS, intentional harassment of low level players who don't have much rad protection, messing up events. There is ridiculous number of ways that these mini nuke zones can be used in a damaging ways. Many dupers duped mini nukes into the thousands. They could turn the entire map into nuke zones. The servers right now can barely handle the 3 possible simultaneous nuke zones. What makes you think they can handle a ton more.
---
You aren't thinking like a griefer or maybe you are and are trying to sneak this in pretending to be a Responder
---
If you ask me I’d say they’re just going after the seven digit stacks of materials and bobbleheads.
---
Oh in that case the only advice I have is to make friends on the game, but that's hard at times depending on the server, sorry to hear you're not enjoying yourself as much :(
---
Stand by for the "I swear I'm not a duper but now all 4,000 of my totally legit TSE shotguns are gone!" posts.
---
If anything gets deleted you should have a chat with whoever sold it to you lol
---
if they bought an item (in CAPS) from an unknown duper, they will actually BE innocent.
---
I like farming mole miners.  They drop shotgun shells and black ultracite materials and glowing meat.  They also go down with 1 shot or 2 shots max for me. 
---
You... cant? That's my point. The best hope people had was to find sellers that only had one or two of anything, look and see if the stack they had consisted of everything at same condition with same modifications, and avoid those.
---
Not a surefire thing by any means, but best attempt at legitimate purchases possible, given the tools we had as players.
---
Here’s hoping my furious explosive handmade was legit. Gonna miss it if not.
---
He said it wasn’t, but that doesn’t mean anything.
---
Luckily I got mine on the first try. If you have them all unlocked except the wind one you would get it on the next event though! 
---
I feel ya. I had 20+ saved up, then I could never get tee quest to proc with any I pulled from my own stash, so I ended up selling them. Now I farm onesies and turn in immediately, rinse, repeat.
---
Wanted is a little much IMO. The alerting of a whole server for bag theft and a 5c bounty would be constant. The player should be marked only to the player/team of the "theif" honestly using theif is a little harsh as well haha.
---
People have been wanting this since dupers existed. And by golly the figured it out. How to fund duped stuff. I kinda feel sorry for people who spent really money on this stuff on Ebay, I also question their mental health, but that's a different topic. 
---
Also what's funny is all those cap selling websites will crash. Justice. 
---
The only bad decision being made here, was buying the game, in retrospect.
---
pretty messed up if you didn't see this coming and mad. 
---
For me, it doesn’t seem to follow a pattern. My character is level 65. Sometimes it cost 40 caps, another day it may cost 5 caps. I suspect it could be in relation to the number of other players in a game. It does change game-to-game for me
---
And, dupers will claim innocence, as will folks buying known duped items
---
This item removal would have made a lot of sense than the explosive nerf.
---
Agreed. I think they are grossly underestimating the number of remaining players this will effect. Given the last patch devastated my friends list, I expect the remaining few to disappear too. Really good timing on their part given the games about to launch. 
---
If you buy it from someone else, I'd wait until after tomorrows update 😆
---
That's your opinion.  I have over 300 hours of fun
---
Yep it will total kill the game if they delete it
---
dupers claiming innocence are easy to expose and ban.
---
Yep. Bye bye
---
Woah...... Forcibly deleting items from people's inventory? Will there be some sort of repayment/replacement for players that were unaware?
---
I've not played for almost a month. I hope I don't log in and find anything missing.... Might want to log in now and take SS of inventory
---
I hope not. I think if you have 500 god tier guns, they are gone but surely not 1 or 2.
---
As someone in your shoes as you, I will say it's not worth it. There are way too many slowdowns in the game compared to every other FO. And it gets worse as you get further in the game. The bugs, the inventory juggling, the repairing, the monotonous super repetitive quests...it all just starts adding up and you get frustrated. 
---
Quick example - you just spent 2 hours clearing out a zone/quest. You got some nice loot and a bunch of items you might want later. Well too bad. Either scrap them now or lose them because your storage limit is a joke. 
---
The grinding in 76 is too tedious, boring, and literally unrewarding. 
---
Shouldn't this make servers for stable?
---
What about all the people that bought duped plans? Are they going to remove the items from their camps and remove the plans from their known list?
---
You may be interested to know that when he tragically passed my friends and I wore black armbands to school for the rest of the year.
---
I think, just, in general.
---
I'd rather buy it, thus the original question. I see vendors selling all the other generator plans, this one has to be somewhere.
---
Right. Anyone who bought anything from another player through marketFO, discord, facebook groups, etc may log in tomorrow night with gear gone.
---
I mean, just by the sheer amount of duping going on, and the impossibility of knowing what you are buying, I am certain I'll lose things.
---
Sorry, it’s gone tomorrow.
---
Get on Anthem next week that's what I'm doing until the DLCs come out
---
I've definitely had the Vampire effect of my Vampire Combat Knife stop working one day.  It was fixed on the next login, but it was pretty inconvenient.
---
I don’t think they could really tell what’s a duped weapon or not, I’d imagine it’s for the massive material and aid item stacks more than anything.
---
One of the biggest problems with 76 is its clear potential. It COULD be quite great, but instead it has 2-4 people putting band-aids on shotgun wounds to the gut and not talking to anyone.
---
If you need any emotional support let me know haha
---
This 
---
My primary weapons are modded shotguns and Dragons.  With my perks I’m pushing 300 dmg on them and they don’t require repairs as often. 
---
The miners consistently drop shells and shotguns you can modify or sell depending on your perk build.   
---
Its duped, There are thousands of those....
---
Just playing devil's advocate.
---
Shunning of a mechanic by a portion of the community is likely an indication of a design flaw.
---
In this case it's pretty clear that joining a party can make you more vulnerable in various regards than strictly playing solo. That seems like a problem to me. I can't recall any other games where this is the case.
---
Dude.  Joke.
---
For those of you losing items due to dupe wipe, don't blame Bethesda for it. What they're doing is healthy for the long term health of the game. 
---
If you're looking for someone to blame, it should be directed at the dupers that sold you that item.
---
Anthem starts next week. I am pumped. Let this wreck of a game die and be a warning to future devs.
---
I'm not convinced a test server works for this type of game. Most games that implement this are round-based with little character progression (PUBG, Battlefield, Overwatch). They use isolated characters so any issues, good or bad, don't affect the experience the non-test players see. With 76 you would have to either invest hours into making a disposable character to test the late-game play, or generate random high level characters you probably won't be invested in testing thoroughly.
---
I'd love to be wrong about this. I'm almost willing to convert the PC version to the "test" version, as long as we can get daily or weekly patches on it. Then push stable changes to the console users.
---
Bye :)
---
Amazing work in progress. Thank you.
---
just dont mess with my mr. fuzzy costume..and i should be ok
---
I've never noticed it for sale but maybe I just didn't pay attention, good luck. 
---
I don't think it's gonna die, but I also don't think it's gonna weather this change very well.
---
Bethesda screwed up their forums a couple years ago when they switched to some new system.  Haven't really participated there since because the formatting is broken half the time.
---
Got a link to it?
---
I want Clean Versions of all Wallpaper
---
I've always wondered whether some of the random legendaries I bought from vendor bots were legit or duped - guess I'll find out.
---
And I'm sure I'll be refunded the caps paid to the vendor bots for any removed items. /s
---
Oh yeah, that stuff too - so many times it's just open-mic noise from jerkwads with a Kinect and no headset.
---
Wait so they cant add stuff if you lost it but they can delete it if its duped?
---
Everyone can say bye to there sentinel assassin armor lmfao
---
Interesting, didn't know that.  Could be!
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322465/upcoming-maintenance-and-duped-item-removals-feb-14-2019?language=en
---
if anything, it solidified for me to stop pre-buying games. Even if I am super hyped for them.
---
I'm staying away from Anthem for at least a month.
---
They said it was just gibberish to sound like Chinese 
---
Im assuming im going to lose my tse western revolver that a guy in a clown suit threw on the ground when I came out of the vault. Oh well
---
I totally bought two duped serums. Hoping since they're already applied I'm fine. That's really the only experience I have with duped items. 
---
I can't advise you because I've come to only liking weird idiosyncratic games because of the standard fallout 1 and a few other very violent / explicit games set for me as a young middle schooler. .. most of my favorite games of all time were such handful of hours, but mind completely blown game / art experiences.
---
While I'm sorry people are going to lose weapons they were most likely unaware was duped, and probably payed good caps for, it's probably best to just get rid of all the duplicated items, though I do believe there should be some sort of accommodation.
---
The big guns are not actually that terrible. On paper they are the best dps dealers, the problem they face is that they are the most effected by armor, and things have too much armor.
---
having 1 or two very heavily armored things isn't the problem, the problem is that the least heavily armored thing has way, WAY, too much armor.
---
If you had a couple enemies who were health sponges, then those weapons would have a niche, they would have a purpose, the problem is that there are no enemies they work well against, and buffing them up to work on the current enemies without considering the long term consequences means that all future enemies have to continue armor creeping, which will only hurt the exact same weapons again in the future.
---
If there was an enemy in the game with 10k health and no armor the best option to kill it would be the minigun, followed by the lmg, as those are the best weapons to kill enemies with inordinate amounts of health, the problem is that there is nothing even remotely close to that, so the weapons are pointless. 
---
Another game, Fallout NV got this right, even in the end game there are strong and dangerous enemies who don't have armor, so you can use weapons that struggle against armor, use hollow points, and they work, because the enemy balance is there to support the weapon balance. Imagine if every 2 levels every enemy in the game gained a point of armor, by level 30 you would need to use ap rounds in every single gun, by level 50 only 3 or 4 weapons would be usable in any way shape or form, does that problem sound familiar, you haven't changed the weapon balance, all the weapons are still perfectly good and balanced, yet 90% are unusable trash because the meta game squeezes them out. 
---
The armor system does not work when you use it the way it has been used, and the misuse of the armor system makes changing the weapons difficult. If you double a weapon's damage you end up more than tripling it's effectiveness, because the armor system works on ratios you end up halving the effectiveness of armor at the same time, meaning straight buffing weapons by the amount that would put them in line will immediately knock them out of line the other way. ARMOR is the biggest problem with the weapon balance, if you don't address it, it will only fester and get worse.
---
Apparently.
---
&gt; Flag screws in your inventory so items containing them will show a magnifying glass. 
---
This is the best advice you could be given at your level. If you're very low level you won't be able to safely visit many of the places that are recommended "farming" locations for *any* kind of component. And there are something like [25 different game items](https://www.metabomb.net/off-meta/gameplay-guides/fallout-76-screws-guide-where-to-find-screws) which included screws, so it's not practical to try to remember all the items that contain screws.
---
To clarify what Mo0kish was saying:
---
Make sure at least one of the screws you have found so far — or else a new item which breaks down into screws as one of its components — is in your personal inventory (i.e., not stored in your STASH).
---
In your PipBoy, from the Items tab, flip over to the Junk sub-tab to show the list of all the junk in your inventory. One of the menu choices you'll see there, depending on platform (it's the C key on PCs, for instance), will be "Component View." Go into Component View and it will show you, by components, what everything in your junk inventory will *break down into*. Highlight the component you want to keep an eye out for — screws in our example, (later it will be lead and springs and other stuff as well) — and execute the "Tag for Search" option (spacebar on a PC).
---
Now out in the world, every time you put your cursor over a container or corpse to see what's there to loot, or over a world item (like a typewriter on a desktop), you'll see a magnifying glass next to the item's name, to clue you in: "Hey, grab this, it's got one of the components you're on the look-out for!"
---
This makes your casual looting while adventuring *vastly* more efficient. It's not that screws will have been added to the game, it's that you'll always know which items do or don't have anything you've tagged for search in them.
---
I’ve got one character in the same spot - though I’m mostly inside - not much structure outside. I love it - had to resist putting all my characters there!
---
(But I have one in a small visitor center near Huntersville and one inside 2 busses near Harper’s Ferry and the Sunday Brother’s Cabin to the West) ... building inside existing structures appeals to me.
---
And if you bought something from a vendor bot? BGS itself may as well have sold the item to me.
---
Beep boop give me chicken
---
Thanks. It will suck if you lose weapons but it will be best for the game for duped items to be removed. 
---
Define innocent. Were possibly going to be punished for using their own system of trading and not assuming everythings duped? What if i bought a duped item from a robot vendor? Why should i be punished for that? Youre telling everyone that after 3 months, sorry you have to play another way find other items,rebuild cause we fkd up our game. No cap reimbursement no respec ability just a tough sh*t guys deal with it you shouldve known everything good was duped cause only filthy cheaters play and sell items.
---
sadly, that won't amount to much. Even if you know who did, he can just say he bought it from person Y, and pass the buck.
---
Is there an official market? 
---
Luckily, I personally got decent rolls by grinding for my marine gear, but shit yeah I didn't even think of the full BOS sentinel gear people were paying 15k caps for on the xbox LFG, that's gonna hurt.
---
Glad to hear it. Didn't downvote you.
---
I got mine after the patch and it’s pretty damn great. Two nukes flying through the air! Goodbye safe spaces!
---
Being dumb has nothing to do with mental health. 
---
There's Red Death Claw, Red Death Claw 2, and Red Death Online.
---
What innocent people trade without going to a 3rd party trade board? And if said people went to said trade board I am almost positive they would know about duping. I for one know that no one has EVER just randomly tried to sell me a weapon. And to all the people that never spent caps to get the weapon (other player dropped it) then they have nothing to lose. I find it very hard to believe that a lot of innocent people will be affected. If you frequent trade boards you know about duping, and you have a rough idea about what items tended to be duped. I actually think Bethesda is doing the right thing. 
---
nope, hate griefer (at least the hard core ones I don't mind if it's all in good fun) I see your point though, It's just that getting flux involves so much and all that running around and weapon repair when you just want some flux.
---
Well, they're gonna mess with it if it's duped... If it isn't though, you'll be A-OK.
---
I have to say that every server I have played in on XBox has been full and with player levels of all kinds. This Game isn't dead at all
---
I didn't trade with anyone for the frame.  I guess it could have been a dupe someone left behind at one of the spawning sites.
---
Sounds like youd already have the better information of SPECIAL to use.
---
For what it's worth, you might have multiple screws on your person, but 2 screws in your Stash.  Try transferring all junk into your Stash.
---
Yes, Desk Fans give you screws.  Other common objects to look out for that contain screws are Hot Plates and Typewriters.
---
Nice trick. Thanks for the share. It takes forever the standard way. So frustrating 
---
I've seen the mod. The plan might be MiA though (many armor mod plans are).
---
Tomorrow's press release:
---
"Sorry, guys. Due to an oversight, we've accidentally deleted every character with the 'Super Duper' perk. Unfortunately our policy is not to replace anything lost in accidental deletions like this. You're welcome to start up a new character -- think of it as an opportunity! See you all in Appalachia!
---
P.S. Also, power armor is now edible. Honestly no idea how that happened. Oopsies."
---
You know I always check out the detonations from afar but I never thought of getting wiped out by one I'm doing this next chance I get
---
Yeah it is lol, I have a good weightless set I run thank god haha
---
How to lose future preorders and sales.
---
Step 1. Release a buggy broken mess of a game that only those who really love it stand by through all the shit.
---
Step 2. Release fuck up patch after fuck up patch nerfing everything they enjoy into the ground.
---
How to lose the only players you have left, and make sure they never buy another game from you again.
---
Step 1. Delete their items. 
---
Step 2. Wonder why sales are down in the gutter on the next release of games. 
---
Because "It Just Works".
---
Am I the only one that sells purified water to vendors? I've made a lot of caps like that
---
The great irony right? Those who duped will keep all their caps while anyone who bought knowingly or not get no caps no items. Cheating does pay kids, it pays.
---
Wow I’m really hoping that instigating hunting rifle I just bought isn’t duped, doubt it but I’m almost 100% sure most of the shit I’ve bought on FB groups could be dupped I’ll be logging in to having 1 weapon rip. 
---
The comments on this post prove that some people will just close their eyes and blindly ignore anything "critical" of the game. 
---
This video is about as neutral as you can get when discussing this game, he's not hating on it and even from time to time says things like "even though this is broken, it's still a neat idea". 
---
He's documenting and pointing out bugs so that hopefully Bethesda sees this and fixes them and people here are like "This guy's just hating, *THAT* bug never happened to *ME!*"
---
Should only take 3 passes of any 'Power Up' event to get all 3 generator plans.  
---
It's only bad the first few times. Given my chronic alt-itis, I can do Poseidon or Monongah in my sleep, and Thunder Mountain only takes me about 5 min more.
---
Saw it coming when duping was at its height, but nothing happened. Stopped seeing it coming when they nerfed TSE into the ground (which actually wasn't that bad, really).
---
I'm less mad than I am worried that they underestimated the prevalence of these weapons, and this is gonna hurt the game's already dwindling population by impacting people unaware what they leaned on was duped.
---
If you want more content and a healthy game, kneecapping unaware player base probably isn't the best way to go about it.
---
How much you want to bet they delete peoples non duped weapons as well. 
---
An automated, ad-hoc script written by bethesda running a pass over the database, deleting player items.
---
Yeah I don't see any risks here.
---
I pretty much farm Legendaries the entire time every time I play.  I am level 120 and have never found a TSE.  But I did find a Two Shot Gatling Plasma and an Explosive Gatling Plasma on the same run.  I think there is more to to this formula than RNG.
---
The lowest level you can craft the gauss rifle is 35 apparently but the combat rifle is still an option if you want it. Just pm me your psn
---
Boy howdy, I've got a 3* TSE Gatling Plasma that I bought from someone that I REALLY hope doesn't disappear from my stash tomorrow...
---
They probably won't, but I'd assume God tier weapons (tse,aae,etc..),  and possibly armor.
---
Well, I guess I'll cross that one off my list...
---
likely reintroduce another dupe that will be exploited within hours.
---
What about the duplication items from bugs and glitches?
---
*Breaking News!* AAA Company, Bethesda, deleted every player-owned item in the game, in a massive fuck-up, ending up killing the game indefinitely.
---
yeah, the standard was set high in games like fallout and myst and every rare once in a while something like stanley wanders along and slaps us in the classic-brain. 
---
I can't stop RPing a Stanley that's forgotten his prewar identity and just wants to get his regular life back pushing the button in the vault.
---
I am with you u/Kanivarin \- just got the game and having a blast with it exploring the world
---
&gt; full BOS sentinel gear people were paying 15k caps for 
---
That's cheap. Well worth it even just to "rent" that kind of armor.
---
Blackbird? Must've missed that one. Any good?
---
Well hopefully they only delete the duped items. But I feel that won't be the case.
---
Next up is removing duped learned recipes and plans.
---
Wonder if this means they may un-nerf two shot and explosive. I don't expect a 100% reversal, but a nudge back in the positive direction would be nice.
---
Sickles work, if I remember correctly :)
---
If memory serves me correctly, 'Hey baby, want to kill all humans?'
---
What about it is garbage? 
---
This is exactly what should happen. There was a VERY small minority who were unaware of god-like guns being duped etc. Those who still chose to buy those specific guns, most likely (but still a big maybe) will be affected. Obviously it will have a negative impact on dupers too. Everyone else will benefit in the long run.
---
Lost a good gun because people were duping it? Now it's not duped and is more rewarding to own? Servers more stable? 
---
Game broken. /s
---
TL;DR: I think so...
---
I like the game quite a bit, but you do have to accept it is pretty different than other FO titles. 
---
The story is delivered far differently. You have to listen to holotapes, read notes and terminals. While you always did this in other FO releases, in this one you HAVE to. there is no other real mechanism to have the story told. There aren't cut scenes and only limited talking NPCs, all in the form of a robot or computer terminal. 
---
It is also an overall sad story. It is about everybody dying and why. It is kind of a heartbreaker really. But in an odd way it is captivating from that front. 
---
The world is significantly bigger and an overall different tone than other FO titles. FO76 is a much more diverse map than any other title. It has distinct zones with distinct features to them. I really like that about the game. There are hundreds of POIs. many that aren't official spots. after 185 hours I still come across a marked location I haven't yet unlocked. 
---
But despite some significant differences, it is most certainly fallout. Dark humor is everywhere. the tropes of the fallout universe are ever-present. The game play is largely the exact same as FO4.
---
The new perk system is a love or hate thing for most it appears. I like it. I think it needs a few tweaks (for the love of god, let me break a card back down!!!) but ultimately it fosters a wide range of unique builds. Because there are limited number of points (50) but dozens and dozens of cards, you are forced to make strategic decision in character building. you gotta think about it. Unlike FO4 where you can just keep grinding away and essentially unlock literally everything, in FO76 you have a hard cap, and need to plan. 
---
Server instability has greatly improved, it was rage inducing before, but I will say it is better. I haven't been booted from a play session in a long time. 
---
At the end of the day, I pre-ordered, paid full price, have about 185 hours so far and no plans to stop playing anytime soon. I can't say I haven't gotten my money's worth. 
---
Cause you already know what happened to Sam.   Think of it as an optional step for bunker buster.  
---
They are going to get rid of those players in the process. Most casual players will have no idea what happened and I bet many quit play. 
---
Duped = illegal. Good-bye illegal items.
---
GOOD.
---
Considering how rare TSE weapons are it's a bit odd how many people were using them.
---
Delete all that duped shit. If you bought a duped item, well, tough luck. 
---
These condescending "bye ;)" posts are without a doubt the cringiest thing posted on the sub. 
---
That's surprising because Fallout 3 Operation Anchorage had serviceable non-gibberish Chinese voiceover.
---
Ehh. I see what you are trying to say. But how many weeks (months?) did Bethesda allow the duping to continue without fixing the issue?   Was there supposed to be NO player economy trades happening during that time? How were people who don't spend their lives on reddit / forums supposed to really get a grasp of the situation before trading with players?   
---
I dunno. Like I said, I see your point. Hell, I am sure at least one of my weapons would be gone if I logged in again after the patch. I don't play anymore but I could see how there could be a large number of people hit by this that came by the items (in their minds) through legit means.   
---
Ahh well. Only time will tell. 
---
If they can track what was duped, should be able to track what was paid and return the caps.
---
Alternatively, should be able to get replacements automatically deposited in the inventories of those affected. Obviously not TSE replacements, but something of the same tier of the same kind of weapon.
---
I'm sure that's much harder than it sounds when I type it, though.
---
It happens sparatically, and often. Kinda sucks cause without the effects the loading time on this gun is insanely long. 
---
Well, it's glitched then because I've done it a half dozen times and never gotten the windmill.
---
&gt; acquired duped items from other players, may find those items removed from their accounts
---
Bethesda, I say this in all sincerity and concern:  Are you fucking retarded?  Is your goal to make the game less fun to play with each update?
---
if Bethesda takes everyones TSEs away tomorrow I feel you're gonna see a fresh start for everyone 
---
I think so, yes. Even detecting the condition would be good - it could ask if I know the way, then get back on track once a clear path is detected.
---
I'd reason it's the same as why the Grafton Monster is seemingly capped at 40.  It's an enemy that is based around a mid-game area, in this case the Ash Heap.  They appear in parts of the Savage Divide, of course, but by that point they are kind of the low enemies in the hierarchy.
---
That said, I agree that Whitesprings is an aberration.  Perhaps to justify all the friendly robots, or being an area where the end of the main quest happens, they made it more difficult.
---
Even if Bethesda can keep track with all the duplicates, they're probably gonna fuck something up. They always do.
---
Yea I needed to go somewhere I could fast travel too because I didn’t have any points near by. And the guy accepted me, then we hung out for a bit and then he gave me a really cool gun (that I really hope will still be there tomorrow) 
---
A level 40 legendary can still be just as good if you have the right effect though. But this is still some good research.
---
I don't think many people need much reason or excuse to quit the game. When their TSE or whatever goes poof they're onto the next game that they won't have to suffer 1000 crashes and disconnects through, and then they will wonder why they even gave it any of their time.
---
Small minority for the better of the majority
---
What level would you recommend as to when i can head over there
---
There is a down side because some people have gear they bought and don't know it's duped
---
If they bought it from a trade board then they most likely know about duping and have an idea what items are commonly duped. How many times have you randomly had a guy just come up to you and try to sell you a TSE? I never have. I am all for them purging the TSE’s from the game. 
---
Just duped items in general?
---
That‘s right. Because the post says so.
---
I don‘t know why anybody above seems worried about their gear...🤷‍♂️
---
I think you may be right, but hoping they value their reputation enough to see it through. Massive amounts of money is at stake if they don't rectify this.
---
If they can identify traded duped items, there are going to be a lot of butthurt people. I'm sure many people have no idea if their weapon was duped or not.
---
In a lot of MMOs, you typically go after the seller, not the buyer.
---
I'm cool with losing MY stuff, I'm only worried about a couple weapons, rest I got from drops... I'm more concerned with the people who are clueless to any of this going on whom are gonna wake up or log on tomorrow and have a bunch of their shit gone with no warning/understanding because they aren't on reddit or searching for this stuff, just think they got a badass weapon from a player, and stop playing the game.
---
This game NEEDS people to survive. This sudden step with no warning isn't going to help that situation, I don't think.
---
I wonder if prices on items in the buy/sell subs are about to skyrocket
---
* The way centaur's look in fallout, and the squelchy sound they make when they "walk", makes me *very* uncomfortable.
---
Hi there.  I will give it to you for free.  My in-game name is cyberhawk1.  
---
I've seen so many instances of what I believe are typos that I truly don't think it goes beyond just that.
---
Occam's Razor.
---
Why would they reward players for taking their duped items? They might as well let them keep them.
---
Wipe them out... all of them.
---
Todd is not "the board."
---
You want to know who the board is?  It's people like Jerry Bruckheimer, Cal Ripken, Leslie Moonves and Robert Trump.
---
It's called a stock and it's not a rifle stock either. It's a shotgun buttstock.
---
Dev1: Hey let's fix the game up and give the players what they want like fixing the daily quests and assortment of bugs/glitches the forums are begging for.
---
Dev2: Huehuehue, the players don't know what they want, they want what we tell them they want. MORE ATOM STORE ITEMS ASAP 
---
Dev1: So the game is in a good state right now?
---
Dev2: After we dumpstered their go to weapons, since we didn't want to waste time to do any real calculations on balanced damage because that would take away from atom shop development, let's really give it to them raw and tighten our grasp around their throats. 
---
Dev1: But they are already discovered our rouse on making the game more grindy and unsatisfying
---
Dev2: CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR! If we delete their weapons and show no mercy they will just have to grind that much harder.
---
Dev1: Here's my two week notice, I'm joining EA.
---
Dev2: *incomprehensible maniacal soul shattering laughter* 
---
Lol. This is not a good idea because the programmer will not be able to competently program this into the game.
---
Worse than "I'm quitting this game" posts, surely not?
---
WOW! Impressive stuff. You are a true artist!
---
Hahahaha
---
Kissing my Bloodied Grognaxe Unyielding torso and probably my Explosive double barrel I bought goodbye then..
---
Rip caps :(
---
Was obviously a bad idea, but I bought a key for Fallout 76 just because. Upon trying to launch the garbage, it crashed. Fun game. :)
---
I'll make the call - I bet they'll offer Whitesprings carpet foundation pieces at some point.
---
I wonder if Bethesdaa or Zenimax were involved in the real money trading of those "illegal" items, if it would still be illegal. I wonder what kind of laws or regulations would have been broken, if they profited from it from some shell company or something.
---
So what will happen if we bought something and it turns out to be a duped item. Are we just SoL?
---
All explosive weapons
---
.......that is all.
---
This. Good post, OP.
---
I'm thinking it's nukas and bobbles as well as halloween candy. They mentioned before accounts with millions of those items. It will be interesting to see what they take.
---
I mean like do those people even still play after tomorrow? I'd bet no. 
---
&gt;If they can track what was duped, should be able to track what was paid and return the caps.
---
THIS
---
No thanks.  Quit suggesting this.
---
I spent countless hours invested into bringing TWO characters up to level 100+
---
I'm NOT doing it a third time.  Not with the XP nerfs and the crazy vendor plan price increases.
---
You know what happens when they do what you want and the server populations are super low?  
---
They REMOVE the servers.  It's not cost effective.  Nobody's using them anyways.  I've seen this happen in countless survival games.  The more hardcore the server gets, the less people play, until they're just gone.
---
Let everyone enjoy PVP.  Bonus, you'll get more development dollars spent on the PVP servers if MORE people play.
---
Even more entertaining in power armor.  The entire suit instantly locks up and than topples over backwards.
---
If last patch was any indication we're about to lose all items created with super duper, chemist, ammosmith, and the double flora harvesting perk . Oops
---
You would be surprised as to how many players simply play not knowing these kind of things are happening, that someone is selling a gun that seems good for a reasonable price.
---
THAT'S CHEAP?!? Shiiiit, I saw people offering full sets for 5k, lol. Never bothered, cuz obviously dupe stuff and more interested in marine gear personally, but goddamn.
---
On a side note, is there any way to see what's in the Atom Shop without logging in?
---
Word.
---
I'm confused.  What is this all about?  A hyperlink?  Did a new inside the vault come out?  lol
---
&gt; During this time, we’re planning to remove items that have been created through duplication exploits from player inventories and stashes. 
---
Implicit in this, but not stated in so many words, is absolute certainty that they *can* distinguish items that have been created through duplication exploits.
---
Am I the only one who has serious, serious doubts about that?
---
\*\*\*\*\*
---
Provided that they're right, and that the only items which are about to disappear really are duped items created through exploits:
---
No one of consequence feels sorry for any duper whose stuff disappears. But most of the players who're going to feel aggrieved by this are people who've bought or traded in-game or even RL items/cash for the duped items. Should we feel sorry for them? Is this fair to them?
---
In civil law (the practice of which is my day job), there's a concept known as the "bona fide purchaser without notice." If you've bought something that turns out to have been stolen, but you had no idea it was stolen when you bought it, and you instead had a reasonable and sincere belief that your seller had clear title to convey to you in exchange for your money, then in some circumstances you get to keep it, even as against a claim by the original, "true" owner.
---
In Fallout 76, though, there was *so very much* publicity about the exploits that if someone was selling you, for instance, a TSE shotgun, it was *overwhelmingly* more likely to be the result of duping than the result of a legitimate drop. 
---
I've bought precisely one item, an explosive-round medic's combat rifle (not two-shot). I wondered at the time if it was duped; I figured, "if it was duped, it probably would have been a two-shot, or at least some better effect than medic's." So I thought it probably wasn't duped. I guess I'll find out tomorrow if I guessed right.
---
But if your TSE is gone tomorrow, I'm not going to be sympathetic: You were on what the law calls *constructive notice* of the wave of duping and selling, meaning you'd certainly have known if you were paying attention, and if you didn't know, it was because you had your head in the sand. You're not a BFP.
---
Yesssss!!!!
---
My fear. I have both two shot and explosive weapons that were dropped off of ghouls/robots/mutants/queen. They have similar designation to the ones that were duped.  Not identical but similar. So the way they have managed their previous patches, my fear is my naturally dropped items disappear tomorrow. 
---
Yeah on PC Ass+Sent gear is trade-only. Never mind if it's duped or not.
---
&gt; a lot of petty shit most gamers wouldn't notice
---
You noticed the 'negativity' enough to try to make up a [conspiracy theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aojnnh/half_the_mods_for_the_76_sub_are_mods_from_the/) about it. I would check my self awareness if I were you. 
---
Awesome!! 
---
I run around begging players for drugs in my tighty not-so-whiteys
---
Honestly, I’ve been done with the game since the massive nerf. The fact that everyone will have to go back to using guns that shoot 1 marshmallow at a time instead of 1.25 marshmallows at a time isn’t too terrible. The armor thing really sucks though, not gonna lie. Especially for those that have spent massive amounts of caps on it and had no clue it was duped.
---
Bet r/market76 will be filled with salt tomorrow. All those TSE .50 cals, shotguns, combat rifles, etc that circulated around like crazy, some or most of them will probably be deleted. 
---
The execution of this is gonna leave users who bought items with caps extremely pissed off. I don't know how many bullets you can put into a single foot before a game or company dies, but I am all for setting world records. 
---
This is the most probable thing so far. I’ll give it a shot when I get home. Thanks you from OP and myself 
---
Jeez thanks man
---
I’ll find ya rn 
---
I wonder if they will remove the stuff my camp duplicated one time, like all the razorgrain, fences, toilets, etc.
---
Look at all the shill downvoting to 1 point. That's why this company is even worse scum than simply being incompetent. They manipulate this subreddit with their shill votes.
---
Check the main sub :-D. There's a maintenance tomorrow where they're removing duped items.  
---
Your mom is very quiet for a lady who has been asking for cummunity feedback -OR- Your mom is very quiet for a lady who has been asking for the community to feed on her backdoor
---
For a single shot gun, I imagine double damage when enemy is at full health legendary prefix is the way to go.
---
By far and away it's the douchey condescending "byeee :))))" 
---
The goodbye posts are def meh but that's about it. 
---
Like anyone really knows anybody.
---
I think the title is meant to be a play off the Middle Eastern folk tale collection the *One Thousand and One Nights* (sometimes called the *Arabian Nights* in english translations). 
---
The title comes from the frame story used to convey the tales to the reader, in which the ruler, King Shahryār, after discovering his wife's infidelity (and becoming bitter/hateful towards women), 
---
 &gt;"begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonor him. Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonor him. Eventually the vizier, whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. Scheherazade, the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name."
---
However, the number of stories included in different editions of the book can be significantly above or below 1001. That is why I believe the video author titled the video "1001 Glitches of Fallout 76" as a form of referential humor, not as an attempt to literally claim that the video displayed 1001 bugs.
---
For a similiar example, if I made a video/post/work titled *Around West Virginia in 76 Days* (or another riff off of *Around the World in 80 Days*), I wouldn't resonably expect anyone to think I was literally spending 76 days total exploring, but that I was referencing a famous novel and doing exploration.
---
Anyways, this post is way longer than expected, just wanted to scribble my thoughts down.
---
Nope. Player vending is "coming eventually" but no real information on when, or what, that will entail has been released. 
---
I've never had any issue turning in data...just it eating all of my data. 
---
Quadphonics if you think the game is "shite" then why are you bothering to post here?  Just to tell people to stop having fun?   You're probably right about if the gaming community as a whole were to stop supporting and giving money to Bethesda then we would probably get "better" games.
---
Realistically it wont happen. There are enough people who will stand by Bethesda no matter how many things are wrong with this game.
---
So posting a toxic comment like this in a forum about a game that you don't even like is at the very least churlish and immature.
---
And the "My one TSE that I legitimately earned got deleted" comments that will then become entire YouTube videos about how Bethesda is unfairly prosecuting their players who never cheated because of course everyone who denies cheating is 100% always telling the truth...
---
Kk added your username  
---
Buddy has no clue what I’m talking about lol
---
Add me vVmahikanVv
---
Probably also sentinel armor 
---
Any player who claims certain colours or "silly" items aren't immersive enough doesn't know what they're talking about. They completely forget, or never witnessed Fallout's long history of weirdness and humour. 
---
Even 76 is full of humour and weirdness. The issue is they WANT the game to be other survival games like the forest or whatever, but with Fallout tacked on top of it. 
---
I spent thousands for my deathclaw gauntlet I hope I don't lose it.
---
I tried and tried with this game and it just failed me!  Last straw was a console hacker would one-shot me and run away.  He didn't even appear on the map for me to report them.  Fallout should be at most 2 player coop no more.
---
Black and onyx color scheme with red accents, looks pretty metal, shoulda grabbed it when I had the chance! It was only a day or like 12 hours or something
---
Yeah, I have my doubts they can tell what's duped and what's not. (But who knows?) But they can probably track who's got 1,034 identical TSE guns in their stash. Maybe they can track a hacker's trades.
---
Google it, looks cool
---
Edit: Regarding the video this post is based off of in particular, I think the title was specifically meant to joke about how the video was ~3 hours long -&gt; a long time -&gt; 1001 Nights
---
&gt; Get back to me when you have a valid counter-argument.
---
The video actually answers this at the 32min mark. 
---
Right on, I did not know that about water pumps! And since you can just string up lots of small water purifiers that makes me feel better about moving my CAMP away from the same place it's been at for quite some time, near a pond near Top of the World. NE of the rail station. Come say hi.
---
I'd love it if you could become a supermutant and basically lose your ability to wear power armor, but always count as being in power armor for the purpose of perk effects. 
---
It's pretty common as SBQ drop, but it's pretty expensive to build. It's not really worth wasting caps on it
---
Same here, i'll be fine knowing my TSEs are gone if they were made from an exploit, some people might not be though, prior to the nerf patch TSEs were being traded left and right everywhere for 5-8k caps. A lot of salt tomorrow, indeed.
---
I found level 45 today, but always never higher, 35-45 max
---
I went in with realistic expectations for this game, and have been happy with the experience so far.   
---
Are there bugs? Obviously. And they can be immersion breaking, but are no worse than they were in Fallout 4 or Skyrim. Given it's a Large Multiplayer Online game (not an mmo like most people call it) built on an aging single player engine, it's amazing it works at all.  
---
The multiplayer ranges from 'Oh, a person? Have some stuff' to 'I hit you or your C.A.M.P.  'cause I'm bored'.  
---
The story, if you make the effort to get into it, is actually deeper and more complex than FO4's.  
---
Don't let the unrealistic expectations of the vocal minority keep you from finding out for yourself. 
---
If you liked Fallout 4 or Skyrim, you'll probably like this.
---
I'm not clueless. I know a bunch of my items are duped. I didn't care. It made up for their shitty waste of time poor excuse for an endgame. I could actually enjoy the game. And still I would defend it, saying how good it was, but the loot system was a mess and it made the game unrewarding for people slaving away day after day for trash drops. And the bugs, crashes, disconnects, freezes, infinite load screens, all of that people still played. How stupid we all were.
---
Well, a lot of the buyers will know –or have suspected– that the items were probably duped. I have collected three explosive weapons over my 400 hours of gameplay, and only one was a legit drop from an enemy IIRC, the other two I bought from vendor bots. I'm not holding my breath whether those two will stay in my inventory post maintenance, *especially* not my TSE The Dragon... When I bought those I made up my mind that they might be taken from me some day.
---
It's not the smartest way for Bethesda to handle this in my opinion, but I can accept it, personally. Many others won't, and I'm not sure if alienating an already dwindling user base is what they should be doing right now.
---
Maybe Bethesda didn't put enough points into their company's Perception and Intelligence, but who am I to judge their wisdom?
---
gonna suck for those who ended up buying a duped weapon with caps and did not know it was duped.
---
though.. i have a feeling i'm gonna lose a few of my items. its what i get for buying stuff on Reddit
---
Nice one!
---
I have a feeling that they may patch this out though :(
---
Same. Daily 7 vendor circuit, lots of events, and some paid nuke delivery runs, all to buy stuff that you have no way of knowing if it's legit or not.
---
That said, I've already had random items (like one piece of PA leg armor, for instance) disappear on me, so maybe it won't feel much different than the game already does.
---
P.S.S. Check out our new items in the Atom Shop!
---
There will be no long term health. After the last patch my friends list became a ghost town. After this patch, I expect the last few hold outs to disappear. People that aren’t on Reddit or wherever and just play casually have no idea where that trade came from. Those players will open their stash and be missing items. They may quit and start playing the games launching Friday. This may be the beginning of the end. 
---
I've been playing on and off in MMOs since early Ultima Online days and at that time death in games actually had a meaning and consequences.  
---
You could respawn yes, but EVERYTHING you had on your character, including armor and weapons, was dropped and could've been looted freely and completely by other players. You also had finite time to retrieve your belongings and in some cases it was impossible because the monsters/NPCs would kill you again before you had the chance to pick it up.  
---
It was normal, it was acceptable and an actual challenge, something worth fighting for. We lived through it and would never think about trying to convince the developer to go easy on us.
---
Fast forward 20 years to modern MMOs like Fallout 76. Death has been watered down to be of no threat at all, in a game in which PvE is already ridiculously easy and yet people complain and want even more comfort and safety.  
---
If you don't give a damn about your characters life, you deserve to lose it ALL, not just that bit of junk you have on you.
---
How you guys can still have fun with no meaningful risk whatsoever is beyond me. I understand that almost nobody would play with permadeath rules like I do, but I wish Bethesda would implement ANY kind of a real challenge into a survival or hardcore mode. Maybe, just maybe some people would realise that overcoming true challenges in games can just like in real life, who would've guessed... actually be fun!  
---
Will not happen of course, because if you pick a random gamer nowdays, the chance is that he's just another wuss who want's to play it safe and is bullshitting himself into thinking he actually accomplished something.
---
Unfortunately, I have found level 50 items from Uranium Fever. I can't provide proof of it, but I know for a fact (this was a week after release, I have since quit the game) that I have gotten level 50 drops. Believe me or don't, that's quite alright because you can test it yourself, but I have done my own testing.
---
If you have played that much I infer you had fun on varying degrees and got your money's worth out of it. 76 is actually a bargain, for example most modern rail shooters give you an 8 hour campaign with zero replay value you can even finish in 2 rainy weekend afternoons, and more often than not for a higher price.
---
2 days before the dupe nerf? Or yesterday? 
---
Or the TSE nerf?
---
If 2 days before the dupe nerf, and you knew about the duping, acquiring a TSE weapon like that at that cost seems ridiculously cheap and knowingly buying a duped item doesn't buy you much innocence. 
---
I said "If."
---
I have very mixed feelings here. Happy to see them being removed. But would dread to find items I bought from grinding for caps gone. Would be very demoralizing
---
Hell, they could even say, "So what? Fuck you." Not much you can do about it. Bethesda ticket certainly won't help.
---
Whilst you may have a point - this proves or at least tells me the tools to track duped gear are actually in place - now, if that’s the case why has it taken this long to hear a resolution or anything about it? 
---
Nah, i blame Bethesda. This shit should have been on lockdown the moment it was found, not weeks after the items have been in circulation being passed around via trades.
---
It’s all good saying people should have an idea what’s duped, but if you’re playing, and you get a message from someone saying “i have _____ for sale for ____” and you agree to the trade, how the heck is anyone supposed to assume it’s duped?
---
We shouldn’t have to be wary when trading because of a duplication glitch.
---
This is on BGS.
---
You forgot “stop by the atom shop to see our new stuff”
---
&gt; Lost a good gun because people were duping it? Now it's not duped and is more rewarding to own
---
Now you have *a sense of pride and accomplishment!*
---
Some things are mislabeled in game. May help us to know which statue
---
.... but that's not what it says. "Players who have used an exploit to dupe items, **or acquired duped items from other players, may find those items removed from their accounts once maintenance is complete**. "
---
Of course! Even casually an armor piercing or shitty but more quantity version of ballistic
---
It's the only way to be sure
---
It was before the explosive nerf, my shotgun went from 800+ damage too 116.
---
UGGGHHHH get ready for the round 2 3 or 4 of:
---
* I'm leaving
---
* I'm done
---

That might actually make it worth carrying around mini nukes and Fat Mans.

There is a workshop on the far East of the map that has a ton of typewriters hidden in the second floor of a building. The name escapes me right now but you need to either marsupial through an elevator shaft or drop in from the roof. I think it is the place you go to find the hacker for the quest Mayor for a Day.
---
I cannot stress how many fricken typewriters there are. Like 20 is my guess. 
---
Well we aren’t going to agree on that! 
---
I don’t think they expected the backlash, nor do I think the backlash was justified. It is far from perfect, there are things I would like to see added (craftable screws, weapon balancing rather than nerfs, a story based return of NPCs, in-game offline trading persistence of some kind) but I am thoroughly enjoying the game and still have at least half the map to get in to.

Didn’t they appeal to the community with, send us thoughts on enemies and they got bashed for that? Comes back to entitlement; communicate with ME SPECIFICALLY on my issues as those are the community issues. Grandiose statements of fact whereas many are happily playing.

So, if items that i've bought with cash that i've been grinding for weeks happens to be duped, i'm essentially just going to lose them? Cool, you always find such good ways to keep me playing this game, Bethesda!
---
Uhm one is the aggressotron head that can be found (probably just to scrap/get material) and  I can build two robot helmets eyebot and "wach"bot, but I think those robots have nothing to do with your stuff. Sorry if this has nothing to do with your list!! I think I'm too shy to make this an official post. Did not wanted to waste your time x.x great effort dude 
---
Soon comes the purge 😆
---
I’m sorry ive had this happen, it’s not acceptable during server loads but dying in the wasteland that’s just part of the game
---
You die, the penalty is lose your junk. You get it back if you are quick enough. You can’t expect Bethesda to give you a free pass when you die
---
There has to be a penalty for that loss otherwise death would be a pointless mechanic exploitable for free respawns
---
Get ready for farmers then, assuming the legacy Chinese gold-farming market from WoW and other MMOs can figure out a way to break even
---
if it was originally duped..yes
---
&gt; Never understood trading with folks you don't know.
---
I'll have you know I'm on a first-name basis with all the Vendor Bots and Grahmn/Chally the Moo-Moo.
---
Way to bring politics into it. Downvote.
---
Is it Feb. 22nd yet?
---
I would see what they had when they wanted to trade. Could not believe what one guy had, I'm not going to lie, wanted to ask about a few weapons but I knew something like may happen sooner or later
---
Ummm yes they would..player drops is much different than enemy drops.
---
Lolz 
---
It’s not illegal but it is kinda stupid not to think that mean and greedy folks wouldn’t try to profit from your mistakes. Regardless if it was virtual or real world.
---
No one is removing items though...
---
Is there a way I can know which of my items were duped? 
---
Great work! But you're also missing Greg from Grafton as well.
---
Oh god no...
---
Hide your kids
---
Hide you wives
---
They're still fine.
---
it's just ramping up, tomorrow you'll see hundreds of them 
---
Amazing photos, you have a great eye, seeing these really makes me think Bethesda should have some sort of photo contest.
---
I stopped playing weeks ago, and this might be the last straw for many players that haven’t quit yet. There is zero chance Bethesda does this properly. 
---
At least it will be a good way to know if I traded any duped items.
---
As the wise Tau would say "For The Greater Good" but I do understand what your saying I wanna see how this plays out it could just effect people sitting on mass amounts of duoed items who knows they say it will only effect a small number of players but I seriously dount it.
---
They are tomorrow
---
Okay, but what's to stop duppers from doing it again, after?
---

---
Ohh that’ll be interesting but game is already losing players 
---
Dude go away, you just keep rambling about how you’re leaving and fuck this game.
---
JUST GO SILENTLY BECAUSE NOBODY CARES.
---
Hide your dupes pray Todd doesn't darken your door step lmao I really hooe they pull this off the right way and don't hurt the little people.
---
This is my expectation. Lots of collateral damage.
---
I’m located on the junk pile on the Clift next to it. 
---
Biggest problem is the scorchbeast attacks there     
---
I have not played in a while, but removing my favorite item won't make me come back that's for sure.. 
---
I'd only be okay with that only if literally every other player in the industry wasn't exponentially fucking worse or selling out to the same, but sadly that is not the case
---
Even now they're still the least evil player in the shittiest industry on earth 
---
The shills keep plugging that game. I played it at release and never played again after the first day. I never went back and I don't intend to. Same with No Mans Sky. I actually enjoyed it for the first few months I played. I never went back to see what improvements. I don't care. When I'm done, I'm done.
---
Now on the PS4 game box it says 1 player on the back. And 1 player isn't an option. That is clearly false and misleading. So there is at least 1 recourse if you lose any items and see that on the back of the box. A refund should still be possible.
---
Damn i guess im just not lucky ive killed 3 or 4 SBQs and still havent found it 
---
For you to know? no..only bethesda can figure that out..but any rare weapon or armor has a chance of being removed..because they were heavily-duped
---
People have been asking for this since duping first came around, of course there will be a downside but this is a good thing. 
---
Well, I know I found my 3\* items for myself.  Most of the things I buy at vendors, I could understand why they would be at the vendor.  Maybe I also figure that if someone is smart enough to do the duping game, they're also smart enough to try to sell it at a bazaar and pocket all the caps for themselves...
---
How exactly? What way does a buyer in Fallout 76 have to check if an item is duped, short of waiting until it's deleted by Bethesda?
---
Yeah I’m with you. You can’t farm good shit hardly and now removing items blah they really just want to burn this game down
---
I love my handmade rifle but there don't seem to be too many mods for it. The action is great, range is great. I want it silenced tho.
---
11 easy tips on how to kill your playerbase and you won't believe number 7!
---
 Just assume every good item you have that you didnt get from an enemy drop will be removed. Did you buy it from someone,found something in a bag or container, buy it from a robot, its Gone.
---
Hopefully they only remove stacked items and not items bought with caps.  I understand it's "for the greater good" but I'd hate to lose some of my items. 
---
That's the real twist is I've traded and dropped alot of gear I farmed myself for something better. Now Ive lost both? That's fucked.
---
Yes, entirely.
---
they have all but came out and said they eliminated duping so this is their one shot to remove items
---
They gotta refund the caps people spent. We can only have suspicions on what was duped and it isn’t fair to everyone who plays legit. I’m already out from heinously bad balancing decisions but I can guarantee I won’t come back if I’m also losing items I acquired legitimately.
---
Could lose guns I bought, but it's okay.  Greater good and all.
---
That isn't really that bad though. Guild Wars 2 sells weapon skins for single weapon types for about $10 each.
---
If it isn't for you, then it isn't for you, but as it is, $5 isn't that outrageous overall.
---
bad news for people that love using dupers as their excuse on why the game is bad. 
---
Same I have a lot of items I know aren't that I would be upset losing but all the bloodied Ive collected for trades fuck it take it bethesda clean me out coukd use the stash space :)
---
If you want to have users, UI/UX design matters.
---
I farmed the vendors caps everyday and bought items from facebook groups.. 
---
I suspect bethesda has a script that flags characters with fat pockets. Tomorrow when they flick at switch, I think it may come down to deciding which is more important
---
Complaints about missing duped items or
---
Being banned
---
Closest would be r/market76.  I've had great luck buying/selling/trading there.
---
It's not out of place at all.
---
Either piece would thematically fit into a ton of times/places in fallout. Both weird and mundane. 
---
Andale springs to mind immediately, and also any settlement with kids/parents (trying to give their kids some semblance of a normal happy childhood)
---
I love how a child's bed, owned by an adult is somehow out of place in a setting filled with roving psychotics, robotic Butler's armed with flame throwers, Androids with the personality of a Private eye pulled from a pulp detective serial/magazine, super mutants, a town built around a bomb, cannibalism, a gun that shoots teddy bears and whatever other junk....
---
But a child's bed? Owned by an adult? There is absolutely no context in which that would fit the Fallout universe, not even a serious context! What? Is this person creating a bedroom for a child they lost in the wasteland as a way to cope with the loss and grief? Fuck no.
---
The Morgantown Airport one I think might be scripted, the same happened to me and the way it happened in story context makes me think it was just a safe in-game introduction to Scorchbeasts. You got pretty lucky with your first real encounter with a Scorchbeast when you were able to hide from it and it went away. My first real encounter was at level 15 and the fucker just swooped down on me out of nowhere when I was out in the open and destroyed me.
---
This man internets.
---
I like it for black titanium and steel, that's about it
---
I think the now is the best time to sell some duped item cheaply lolz
---
Yeah but still would rather like to not see a mass exodus of legitimate players because they lose there favorite gun that they had to barter for with items they earned with ass hats who took the easy route. Like I said interested in how this plays out.
---
I think if that happens and enough people post about it, they'd hopefully do some sort of a rollback... but considering this isn't as "persistent" of a game as others where server rollbacks happen, I dunno.
---
It's a legit fear, tho. Isn't like Bethesda has nailed a single patch with this game yet.
---
This is the most autistic post I’ve seen to date 
---
While this would be a good feature it would have had zero effect on your situation.  You're in a nuke zone... none of those people would have had pacifist turned off so your options would have been limited to yelling at them over mic chat until they muted you or trying to attack them anyway and ending up wanted at which point everyone else turns on you.
---
That's exactly the problem - the todays attitude of engulfing oneself into a complete comfort zone. No matter how little consequence there is for dying - people want even more safety. Makes me think if the complainers play their offline games with god-mode cheats on.
---
Agreed.
---
I just don't believe there evaluation of this will effect a small number of players cause you can bet that a vast majority of players own atleast 1 duped item.
---
Oh this gone be goooood. Now I’m paranoid as hell to what I have bought from ppl lol, hope I dont log in to a naked guy lol, I dont have any backup armor lol.
---
Well now I’m finally gonna find out if that two shot shotgun I got for free from that lvl 200 was a dupe or not.
---
...on to another game..
---
Why do you censor "motherfuckers", but not "ass" or "shit"?
---
Yup. 
---
I actively avoided trading (literally never) and picking up items that weren't legitimate loot drops so you can bet I'll be checking my inventory 
---
Hopefully not. That’s a good story
---
I agree...I'm fairly new to the game, I went into my inventory and I was like...Jesus, this is a clusterfuck.  Sorting by alphabet is crazy because they use so many wacky names.  I just logged off.
---
People apparently forgot how to scroll and read....
---
I’d eat power armor
---
Why would it be a joke? Is pink not "cool" enough? Are only "badass" badass colours allowed?
---
I forgot we are playing a super dark, post apocalyptic survival simulator, not a fallout game sorry. 
---
Maybe next you can complain we are allowed to make female characters, and how they shouldn't be able to wear dresses or anything "feminine" cuz itz not Badass bruh!
---
Why do I feel like everyone's inventory is about to get wiped, not just the people who duped? Given the track record of these "hotfixes" its totally feasible.
---
I wonder if legitimate legendary items that were loot drops will get pitched during this purge?
---
Science! I'm proud to see you developed a hypothesis and then systematically tested it.
---
And like any good scientist, you published your conclusion regardless of your desired findings, having disproven your hypothesis.
---
Really? How the hell do people forget that lol
---
Mole-Rats *suck*.  There is literally nothing fun about that enemy.  Half of them are infected and they almost always get a free bite on you because of their broken burrowing.  If they were vanquished from the game during tomorrow's maintenance, we'd be all the better for it.
---
I'm 100% convinced the handmade plans I bought off someone weeks back we're duped. Just hoping my legendary handmade isn't removed since the mods were learned through scrapping guns made off the plan. 
---
Speak for yourself. 
---
Eh. They'd just be putting it out of its misery at this point....
---
SE did it for FF14, and i suppose to a lesser extent the same happened with NMS.
---
That's 2 example of failed game reborn as much better ones. Especially FF14. If a company like hello games can pull it off, surely BGS can as well. Will they do it though ? That's the question. 
---
It all depends on how much they value their playerbase, and reputation over money. If they Don't i know it is the last game i ever buy from them, and im not saying this now and end up buying anyway. I will not and will actively try to discourage anyone i know from doing it.
---
However if they do end up giving it the a full on polished FF14 treatment and by extension redeem themselves as a company, i will be the first one praising them for having done the right thing. And more importantly they get to keep me as a customer which is what also matters.
---
Thanks for the kind words, but don't be fooled :) I didn't post all the meh pics (bad lighting, took the pic too late, etc), and those are.. a lot.
---
If they actually implement player vending everyone will be trading with anyone. Honestly me and my group trade for free because that’s my group. And it’s not like they specifically said “only trade with trusted friends.” 
---
The game was literally designed with it in mind.
---
No, they don't have to refund anyone anything. Thats a ridiculous expectation. 
---
That's the super cream episode, that makes him an actual hero. I think the worms one just made him smart and strong. 
---
We all did. Almost Every good item i have i bought from a robot from someone selling it.
---
Appreciate it
---
Not yet. Wait till it’s mostly fixed. 
---
Why are they just doing this now?
---
You're acting like it hasn't been dead from the start. 
---
Pa is now edible hahahahahahha omg
---
&gt; Yeah OK, but they phrase it like they have a batphone to them.
---
&gt; 
---
Batman could make a full-fledged Fallout game with single player and co-op gameplay with hundreds of hours worth of side-quest and main story. And get it all to run on Unity or Unreal Engine. 
---
Enjoy playing alone. You are right they don’t have to do anything. They don’t have to make a good game. The sheer amount of comments and posts around the issue definitely showcase you aren’t being aware of the player base. But hey if you enjoy the world stagnant and solo, more power to you. 
---
this post wins the ass/sent award
---
Good thing those TSE are "worthless" now so people won't mind when they disappear ;)
---
Don't you know ? 
---
There's only 3 types of people in the wasteland. 
---
Hardcore prepper wannabe military types.
---
BOS
---
And Raiders. 
---
Everything else is dumb and too silly. 
---
To be fair i haven't grind or gone to "spots" i've just been exploring and reading lore and putting the side stories together. Im doing just fine without having "the best items" in each category. Im not overpowered, but nor underpowered, im doing what i've basically done with all the fallout games.
---
Curious, how do they know which items are duped items? Is there something in the code that targets duped items and not earned items?
---
My bed is a dirty ass mattress stacked on top of cabinets, illuminated by a sweet irradiated glow 
---
he just had a dev build at the time. they had to limit the stash for sever stability 
---
Well when you look at the small number of people still playing, it will hold true......Ill see myself out.
---
uh huh.
---
huh, remove things from player inventories... what could possibly go wrong?  
---
Bethesda should have put a lot of work into stopping duping back in December, when it became well-known and was widespread enough that servers were constantly crashing. Instead, they let it go on for weeks. 
---
Well, tomorrow should be at least interesting on the boards. 
---
I have my standards.
---
You're assuming this sub represents the player base accurately. 
---
A sub that thinks immersive and lacks a sense of humour are the same thing.
---
Yes! Finally!! 
---
Every legendary gets deleted...though "every item" as suggested by others is probably also an option
---
I love it
---
I would NOT want to be the dev on this ticket...
---
Yeah, but it's not like any of them are worse then the others.
---
I've been cheerleading this game ever since the beta, with few exceptions.   But if a single item is gone from my inventory tomorrow I'm shelving the game
---
I’m more worried that outfits and armor will be wiped :s I only have one TSE and I never use it anyway
---
Vertical half walls.
---
I knew there needed to be a better way.  I'm glad to know now that there IS a better way already there and it makes perfect sense.  I always used ponds and rivers because the pump was too slow, but now I'll have a backup when I just need like 20ish waters to craft a smaller amount of  aid.
---
I suppose, but don't you think that he would have known that would change in the dev build?
---
I actually got a decent drop that I've seen copies of being sold my favorite gun will probably be gone with the rest. I doubt every weapon has it's own id. They're probably deleting all the God weapons. 
---
Everyone is talking about weapons, like every one of you people haven’t bought calibrated shocks/jet packs/stealthboys etc.  but yeah sure, the guy u bought it off was legit...
---
Everyone gonna be naked/unarmed tomorrow.  Why didn’t I respec ghoul?!
---
We seem to be doing just fine, I mean it's a challenge but isn't that what the SBQ is supposed to be?
---
... how?
---
I never bought any weapons from anyone because of this alone.
---
That's weird
---
Thank goodness second Rust Storm is coming. Can't wait to see the "I BoUgHt tHe gAmE I Do wHaT I WaNt wItH It" comments.
---
Either way this should be entertaining! If it works then people would freak out over their lost items. If they screw it up people will freak out over their lost items. Win-win for the peanut gallery!
---
Even as early as the game first launched, it was a buggy piece of shit. 
---
Nice. Just in time for New Dawn.
---
Looks like it's over. Bethesda has the high ground.
---
On a personal note, this is great to hear. If any of my acquisitions turned out to be duped, I won't miss them if they're gone. Let's get them cleared out of the system for the greater good.
---
This exactly.  There were specific god tier items going around, and I didn't buy anything from anyone to be safe.  I'm saddling up my high horse tonight baby, clean as a whistle
---
Different armor reskin options.. for example, 
---
Metal trash armor - a reskin of metal maybe made with scrapped road signs and or pieces similar to super mutants.
---
Leatherish plated armor - something similar to the railroad armor from 4
---
Some Chinese combat armor - not stealth armor - idk surprise me but still just a reskin
---
Something like the desert ranger armor since it would sell like hot cakes.
---
According to the logic of a few people I've seen we are supposed to be gods who walk the wastes of West Virginia killing everything without effort with zero chance of death.
---
Guess I'll be trading it in for that sweet gamestop $7 bucks of credit maybe Anthem won't be such a shit show or better yet I'll just wait for borderlands 3 never supporting Bethesda again after this shit show of a game. 
---
Same here and that's what everyone originally thought. I remember farming for hours one day with a friend, we decided to hop off and when I was about to go to bed I was like Feck it, I'm going to run whitesprings one more time. 3. Back to back. 
---
Number 1 reason I won't ever buy a TSE, AAE or any weapon variant that's over 10k on the unofficial market. 
---
X box, pc or Ps4?
---
this is his outlook on women as well 
---
I'm pretty sure all the vendors have a standard base inventory and they get reset every day at a certain time or at some other condition. Mod selection maybe being the exception. 
---
What makes me think this: Last night I farmed a nuke zone at Whitespring and was selling/buying at the train station. The nuke zone ended and I ran out of radiated fluids before I stabilized all my flux. The train station vendor happened to have a handful of fluids that someone had sold him (in addition to dozens of 1-star legendaries). I left the buy screen to equip hard bargain and when I opened him back up, his inventory was back to 'default'. No legendaries and, sadly, no radiated fluid. I was ticked. It happened around 11 pm US eastern. I don't know if that's a set time or what but I didn't do anything that would have triggered it. I checked the map and there was no one nearby so it wasn't a case of a new player in the area causing a reset. I tried getting in and out of the buy screen thinking it was a server glitch. Nada. 
---
So I'm guessing you are seeing his base inventory and there's no way to 'reset' it. That's just not a heavily trafficked vendor (at least on any PC servers I've been on) so he's not getting stuff sold to him to increase his variety.
---
Well depends on who you ask, I grew up with a fairly well established ranking system for curse words. Before south park, the word shit just wasn't said on networks, while others were fairly safe.  Also, some like dick and ass are always low rank because of multiple usages that aren't swearing.
---
Hell
---
Damn
---
Ass
---
Dick
---
Bastard
---
Bitch
---
Shit
---
Fuck
---
Cunt (as established in curb your enthusiasm as being the worst)
---
Special cases go to racial slurs, not going to attempt to rank them here lol.
---
Crap gets special mention, as when I was young, adults still punished us for using the word, and sometimes even the word 'sucks'. 
---
You have a point...
---
Bethesda is about to make a whole lot of people hate Valentine's day 
---
Ive seen her die within 5 minutes countless times lately. If dupes are as rampant as most think than itll be 30 minutes of wasting ammo and she'll fly away just like the good ole days.
---
At least now when I sell my honestly gotten goods people won't accuse me of duplication
---
To be clear I've never duped myself.  I trade more than play, and I'm sure 90% the items I currently have in my inventory someone duped either the guy I got it from or the guy he got it from.  So are all the items I've spent 100's of hours trading for going to disappear? What about the guy I sold a gun which I got on trade?  Is it going to leave his inventory too?  NEWS FLASH folks if u have any 3\* top tier weapon or armor in your inventory that you didn't pick up yourself its a dupe.
---
$10, LOL. Nice job, Bethesda.
---
I picked up a 2* blooded explosive .50 cal at train station vendor ages and ages ago, but it did seem to be a one-off. Sometimes I'll see three or four identical legendaries at a vendor, which are obviously duped. Hopefully the .50 isn't but whatever.
---
The one I'd be more annoyed about is my 2* double crippling gatling gun, which I sold my looted 1* double gatling gun for at vendor bot phoenix. 
---
Guess I can always just use my looted 3* AAE gatling laser...to tickle enemies.
---
Upvote and thanks for the laffs
---
I love how folks who didn’t properly think things through get their butts beat
---
I have done the daily hunt numerous times in the hope that I would get a mounted plan. Talked my team into doing it, too. No luck. Lame hunting rifle, no legendary item either. Must be bugged.  
---
No i believe its just items people duped not crafting probably but everyone who has assasin sentinal armor should be worried
---
Bethesda didn't forces the anyone to give back the money they made on those Websites. Soo.. I'd says they already got most out of it already. 
---
Awesome!! Love it yo
---
I bought traded for most of my good stuff. And gave away all of my honestly gotten good stuff to low levels. More fool me I guess for being nice.
---
I think loot can be enhanced up to the highest tier of levels when another player with a high level is hanging around in your general map area. Again, not confirming this is true either.
---
This could be said of every Bethesda title ever, let's be real
---
