Bethesda doesn't have to pay Bethesda for their own assets. They're still the same publisher, and in this case the same studio too.
---
---
---
It sell them at base cost and let another sucker worried about storing it and waiting for somebody to pay 30,000 cap
---
That sounds awesome
---
Always happy to help... Wish it happened back more often.
---
Why do you need to be fully bloodied up to kill level 40 ghouls?  They die easily even when I de rad for the ore collection.
---
Interesting, I wasn't a huge fan. But I guess I'm looking for something that fallout no longer offers, I still enjoy the game but it's the apocalypse. I want them to recapture the feeling of the apocalypse, but we can make beautiful prewar looking houses, you know? It just doesn't feel like fallout anymore
---
Can you say nailed it! I feel the same at this point, 3600hrs in and I can't honestly stand it,  mind you I did make an honest effort. As I said before, I am at level 40 on the board, but after hearing the outcome it is even more disappointing. 
---

---
Well maybe it time to move on to something new and exciting, unfortunately all good things come to  an end. 
---
I wish you all the best!

This could never be fix , there always going to be a META in online gaming.

If you need some water, just plop next to a river and put some industrial water purifiers in that river, or I can show you a good spot that is actually right next to me! Even tho I‚Äôm level 35 I can still build stuff lol
---
It does if it hire a thrird party to create a 3d model it splits the rights. I have a good example for this wasteland ware fare is owned by bethesda I help kick start eveytime anew expansion comes out they write me a xxheck
---
Awesome right?ü§†
---
I wish I could change my HUD, the yellow is difficult for me to read and I miss changing it all blue.
---
Safest place I've ever camped has been right beside the Scouts camp. No one ever nukes up there, the only things that ever attacks my camp are bloatflys or radstags that my turrets finish in seconds, sometimes a merchant randomly spawns right behind my camp, there are dailies and events one cap of fast travel away, two workshops at walking distance.... and it's eerily beautiful up there. It was meant to be a temporary camp while doing scout stuff but I'm considering just staying up in those peaceful mountains for good.
---
Yes, it's bizarre that it wasn't in the game to begin with.
---
I agree but I think some stuff can look clean within reason
---
Yeah but in real life we can‚Äôt keep opening presents to get unlimited money. 
---
Though Tbh I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people trading rare items don‚Äôt even want caps anyway.
---
Civil War Era Dress. Goes with pretty much anything and looks hilarious if you jet pack around in it

No

Totally,. Within reason. But it's everything now and it makes me sad, but it's just one game right? Maybe they'll make a more true to form fallout

Man I want this so bad

I‚Äôm hoping for a system like the division 1 underground dlc
---
I got a 25/25 shotgun the other day.  Right attributes, wrong gun....
---
Mostly I just farm it for XP now. I pick a side of the main room, and None Shall Pass. I even watch out for damage to the important NPCs. 
---
At first I maxed this out with my group. Went from holding all ore for the end to dumping some to spawn the tougher baddies. All 4 alive, max ore. I have completed it this way somewhere between 50 to 60x, no rad barrel, no Emmet mountain hazmat. I am sick of of grinding it out for way too low a chance at meh rewards. Mostly I just farm it for XP nowüëç
---
No time for apologies in the wastelande
---
The reason fallout 1st outfit was pretty dirty lol but yea it‚Äôs a mmo style game so I give them passes on a few things. I‚Äôm sure fallout 5 will be great tho
---
"If you were collecting them then the event would be successful"
---
If you read like anything I posted then you could piece together that I was doing the objective but everyone let the survivors die. You'd know that if you actually protected the survivors which by your comment I assume you don't.
---
Fed76 and it's pricing is the laughing stock of all serious fallout 76 traders... Pricing is not based on some silly outdated website that tells you what something goes for. Price is agreed between buyer and seller, and based on supply and demand.
---
Be nice if a button let you spin the barrow without firing.
---
Not bugged or visual. It doesn't get affected.
---
One of mine completed later - getting the magazine via trade or drop didn't work initially, but later the challenge completed. Unfortunately Ib don't know if I did something special...
---
Hmmm weird I was getting max 4k for events done.
---
Unless you mean daily?
---
I usually can't go down in my bloodied build. I have a hazmat suit but the problem is I'm going to get severely over encumbered unless it's the start of the day and I sold my heavy legendaries to the scrip vendor. I have some power armor but it's in my stash and if I wear it I'm over 600 in weight because I don't have my backpack.
---
I can though one shot ghouls and keep all four people alive though.
---
Yeah I wish I had a team to communicate with properly. But I would hate to bark orders at strangers so I can't do it in public teams.
---
Ah yes, Sysiphus and his ever rolling boulder. Perhaps not quite as bad as Prometheus, who had an eagle sent to eat his liver each day as the liver continually regenerated, to perpetuate the torture.
---
Make note never to cross Zeus.
---
&gt;  I didn't even bothered to get past rank 5.
---
How the hell can you actually play this game and not get past rank 5? Sounds like you just want to complain and don't even log in at all.
---
For resources [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/) is a good map that'll help you pick out where you want. 
---
Setting up a vendor is pretty simple. Place a vending machine from the Vendors tab (I believe that's what it's called, I'm not at my PS4). Get out of workshop mode and click on it. You can select items from your stash or inventory and assign them a price. From there, you'd need to hook the machine up to a power source so other players can see what kind of items it has from the fast travel map, otherwise they won't see that you have a vendor
---
Lead champagne looks pretty cool.
---
That's a good point, another limit that i didn't know about, thanks man
---
Let's hope lol good luck out there
---
Only PC has mods. And not from official bethesda site.
---
Really? That‚Äôs weird. Does it say that anywhere (I‚Äôve missed obvious things before). I mean it‚Äôs a mutation and class freak reduces negative mutation effects. Even both FO76 build calculators have it reduced.
---
Maybe? Try using whatever button it is you use to enter the build menu.
---
Your welcome man. I've had a bad day today and hearing this makes me feel a bit better
---
lol in that case there would probably no cool item left
---
Try dressing sexy with some nice lingerie every once and a while.
---
Thanks you too üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
---
Why? Is there a big?
---
Huge sneak bonuses, and ammo conservation due to the silly high damage. Also much easier to manage the large events, project paradise, radiation rumble....
---
It does. Hold down the button like you're going into build mode at your camp.
---
That‚Äôs crazy how do mods work on an online game?
---
Tbh I fucking love the glow star wallpaper. It looked awesome and it is. Cant wait for the one with the rocketships....wish there was more stuff like this
---
We have a group message on Xbox with the four of us in. Never use mikes before the event just message the group I'm doing this, etc who's doing that. To be honest, we could use quest oriented, emotes like I'm defending I'm running etc and more like that. Get off the tent roof etc.
---
huh?
---
Yeah, mine is up pretty high, too, for gunslinger, but I roll PA/heavy guns at SBQ and other boss fights.
---
Little tip for you, invest in Wasteland Whisperer (charisma.) You can pacify a lot of the mobs at SBQ and other events so you don't get swarmed. Works on ghouls and super mutants, too.
---
I know that the two replies are meant as one sentence.  I‚Äôm still trying to get an answer about *where* he saw this; I presume in a vending machine. 
---
I think he‚Äôs one of those that doesn‚Äôt realize why some of use price Tick Blood Sacs at 30k in our vending machines, usually ones that are tucked away and unpowered. 
---
I had someone message me once to complain about the prices of my items in one of my machines, **that was locked behind a door and unpowered.**
---
*No, XxXMegaPoonSlayer69XxX, I‚Äôm not expecting anyone to buy that Cooking Oil for 30k caps...  but thanks for the Raw Fertilizer on my bed.*
---
Oh me and my team have no problem we are there farming exp and kill everything on sight. We only fail it because nobody collect the ores

Yea I recommend getting the friendly fire perk and keeping them alive too since you care so much üòÅ

What about if you do them at workshops ? Do they stay in your camp budget then?

There are literally dozens of places in the Forest where you can gather plants. So I think they were astounded by the question.

---
When someone gets down, it's like he becomes my target and I sprint thru hordes of ghouls and deathclaws while exploding on the way from the amount of hits I get just to revive you with some nice HP regen and vodka.
---
Radiation rumble is my fav event to do that.
---
They are mainly only visual things or bethesda would ban people for using them. Nothing that affect game mechanics or give serious advantage over other players. Like highlighting corpse meatpiles, showing enemy health by % not just bar, changing the look of some weapons, more user friendly / more detailed inventory etc etc.. And ofc they are only client side. If you mod a weapon to look different you are the only one that sees it.
---
Not once did I get probed by an alien either
---
It‚Äôs a rough starting point for those just getting into trading. After about a month a player probably would have a better grasp of the market.
---
And if you are on a team, other team members get a small reward for each map you use.
---
The bug about nothing.
---
Yeah because legendary run has so many cool thing ^(/s)
---
I had a good chuckle imagining just an emote of the vault boy angrily pointing at a goofy vault boy standing on a tent and then down to the ground.
---
Caps are worthless as long as the duped presents exist in high numbers and I saw a dude with 600+ yesterday.
---
I wish they gave fewer items and would just put in atoms instead, I‚Äôd rather get atoms and save them for what I want rather than have some ‚Äúseason pass‚Äù feature which removes all daily/weekly atom challenges which also rewards crap structures/paints/skins with barely any 150 atom rewards. It felt like they just mishmashed a bunch of failed atom shop item concepts into the board and called it space themed even though the majority of the items weren‚Äôt even related to space. 
---
Ghillie paints are lame (atleast in my opinion, hunting rifle one could be appealing to people who use it), blood eagle skins are also lame af, and the power armour skins just look nowhere close to how good the atom shop skins are (I mean have you seen the liberty prime armour). 
---
At the end of the day it‚Äôs just my opinion, it just would‚Äôve been nice if It could get more atom rewards, maybe like 100 atoms every 5 levels or something or 50 atoms every 3 levels. It sucks that you are pretty much forced to buy 1st or buy atom packs to get stuff from the atom shop, since pretty much everything is 500+ and skins go for 1000+. 
---
Fo76 has taken yet another unfortunate turn, Bethesda is trying to employ a strategy that failing games would have, take away the ability to earn things for free, and force players to use $$$ if they want to buy skins and such with atoms. 
---
It makes sense for free games or cheaper games to have skins/accessories which can be bought for $$$ (aka stuff that are pretty much variants of default skins), but for FO76 which was priced as a triple A game, it‚Äôs blasphemous to create accessories which will now be unobtainable. One pack now = all the atoms you earn from the legendary run.
---
I agree. I hated it at first (never tried hardcore/survival mode in any of the other games, so having to eat and drink regularly was new for me) but food and drink is easy enough to come across so it isn‚Äôt that bad. It‚Äôs really only a minor inconvenience when you have to stop in the middle of what you‚Äôre doing to fill up, and losing that survival aspect would remove some of the realism from the game
---
well there‚Äôs no reason to comment it, if he isn‚Äôt going to help me like all of the other lovely people on here, then why bother. I‚Äôm not as knowledgeable as some of the other folks, so I thought I would ask, come on man.
---
Glad to be of service lol.
---
Working on my second character now. She is all charisma, healer, support, team fluffed now since LFG stuff was added to the game. Normally I always try to on my main, but new character is strictly a team build healer/revival.
---
Hopefully shared storage becomes a thing soon. My main gets more healing  stuff than I need. I wanna transfer it.
---
Standing on fences does actually help that player from being unexpectedly taken out by a dozen scorched creatures.
---
oh yeah, that‚Äôs smart, thanks!
---
I've seen weapons trade for what would amount to over 1 million cap value
---
Tell *him* that. I just attempted to help you understand his likely point of view. Doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with him.
---
Nothing *I* said was rude or belittling to you.
---
I mean...we -did- come out of the same vault.   Yeah, you might be a low-down security-calling bastard, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm gonna give these irradiated savages the satisfaction of killing you.
---
No.
---
You can participate in a queen fight regardless of whether or not you have the quest.
---
Getting a drop from the the queen depends on how much damage you do.
---
IIRC, the threshold is 1k damage.  Under that, you get nada loot from her, but should still get something for surviving the fight/completing the event.
---
so why downvote my comment, and upvote his?
---
Just admire the booty.
---
Search for patch 20 atx, we have a spelunkers outfit upcoming and something else I‚Äôve forgotten
---
Yes sir, welcome to the reprehensible, I-hate-paying-for-it-but-it's-actually-kinda-worth-it club. I despise that I continually pay for FO1st but I would never go back at this point. I play almost entirely on private server and only go public when necessary.
---
Nah, it's too late now.
---
I normally use fed76 as above and knock 2k off the max and put them in vendor for that
---
Isn‚Äôt it great! I once found a bag of really nice gear outside Mumbles‚Äô old place. It was a game changer for me at level 60.
---
I‚Äôm gonna go dust off my ska records right now.
---
Speed Demon has never been affected by class freak sadly. Same hunger and thirst loss no matter the rank in class freak. Angry Turtle goes over all mutations pretty well in a more recent video on YouTube. Hes pretty knowledgeable on the secret effects of some mutations and what not.
---
Cool

---
And I am against grind and for choice.  The S.C.O.R.E. board will burn out a bunch of players.  Especially, if what they want is Rank 100 or if the next S.C.O.R.E. board is shortly after the current one.  Having a vendor will give players the incentive to get the items they want without burnout and can get as many Lunchboxes, Fireworks, and other unique consumables that they want.

She‚Äôs in her house this finishes 2 Quests if you have all her recordings

The problem is, that effect is "positive" and thus wont get affected :)
---
It is clearly a bug, but has been years, so dont get hopes up for "fixes"....
---
‚ÄúFinally someone with the guts to actually do something about it‚Äù
---
Weird because those dozen of scorched creatures don‚Äôt show up till she lands to spawn them
---
I didn‚Äôt.
---
maybe it's because you call her Ms. Mumble, which she does not appreciate. respect her has Purveyor Murmrgh and you'll be up to your ears in god rolls. works for me...
---
Ah yeah makes sense, as a lower level player it's pretty cool to come across lol
---
All of this plus brain fungus soup for +5 Int which equates to 10% XP boost.
---
Yee
---
If you want to built it near a resource spot I advise you the lead ones, in the future it may helps you craft ammos but that places are often already taken and this will bring you to an infinite server hop cycle I don't think everyone want, for me that I love fallout for his landscapes I build mine near to an overhanging with the whole view to the cranberry bog and that view never bore me. 
---
For what to build just try again and again until you're happy with the result, when you start to unlock new stuff for the camp you'll probably want to change something and so on... I was happy with my camp after 1 year on pc and when I switched to playstation  I redone the same camp cause I loved so much what it became over time.
---
Remember that you don't have to do something because someone in internet says it's better than something else, just do it because you like it cause this game let you free to do (almost) everything with your camp.
---
That is my advice for my personal gameplay experience, I hope it works as it worked for me and give you the same good feelings after you complete your camp.
---
I am able to loot her but however I do not receive exp from killing her, So I assume that I have done 1k damage or more. However, I get no Exp from killing her or any rewards from completing the scorched Earth event except the guaranteed armor piece.
---
Yah this was a time waster..
---
No. I played til rank 5 on the first day to get the ammo converter. After that looked up the other rewards and came to the conclusion, that it isn't worth it. Had to study anyway and not much time to play.
---
So I didn't bothered with the season anymore and just played like I would do if there was no season. I'm now something like level 10. Don't know exactly tbh
---
well someone is, apologies if it‚Äôs not you. I guess someone doesn‚Äôt like people that are less knowledgeable than them lol.
---
Okay, well what I‚Äôm saying is that the asset itself was made for a reward in nuclear winter and then was used for this instead. And seeing as how if you buy an atomic shop item or skin you can use it in nuclear winter. The intention being it was designed with nuclear winter in mind and then put into this instead. Either way it isn‚Äôt space themed or has anything to do with a legendary space adventure and doesn‚Äôt seem at all like it was originally meant for this season of rewards is all I think either of us are trying to say. Or more it was initially a pickup item for nw that you‚Äôd just use in the match instead of a cosmetic for the game as a whole.
---
I am able to loot her after the kill so I assume I did 1k damage or more, I receive no Exp from the kill or any awards from the Scorched Earth Quest except the Guaranteed Armor piece.
---
Also can't you now technically buy perkcardpacks?
---
You hit the nail on the head buddy.
---
I found mine in the mouth of the alligator at Wavy Willards park however ive been told there is another spawn in the park somewhere
---
You can definitely use the ghillie outfit (and I saw someone using a ghillie hat of some kind) in NW, though. I have it set as my NW outfit currently.
---
They do. Just absolutely nowhere remotely close to the amount in this game. No other game I‚Äôve played puts out a season where the points system breaks for players so they can‚Äôt progress. Everything is a band aid to a gash. Been that way since day 1. I had over 18 months of hope they would turn this around. My hope has finally run out.
---
DO A KICKFLIP
---
That last one is wizard
---
I'd love some more... The Prosnap led me to fall into a rabbit hole of collecting and restoring real Argus C2 cameras - kinda want to put a collection of Prosnaps into display cases now...
---
I think I have it in my vendor, are you on xbox?
---
Good job i'm not a serious fallout 76 trader then
---
At least you get weapon skin you can use. There are no pistol skins in the season.
---
That‚Äôs part of what this sub is for; to help other players. He seemed to be annoyed by that. 
---
I‚Äôm not. 
---
But I do recommend avoiding jumping to conclusions in the future.
---
Looks like we aren't getting that R91 skin for the Handmade any time soon judging by the lack of preview pictures for it. That's currently my most anticipated ATX item, along with the wood furniture Screaming Eagle (although I'm not sure I'd be willing to buy it if they release it before applying their promised fixes to the already released variant).
---
Besides that, though, this all looks really good. That fireplace is leaps and bounds better than the Christmas one they made available again this week, and those prefabs are fantastic. I'm also hopeful that the jukebox will play Appalachia Radio, as many have been requesting pretty much since release. I'm having second thoughts on that Mothman hunter outfit, though; when I saw the screenshots of it from Nifskope it looked perfect, exactly like the kind of outfits I always modded for myself in Fallout 4, but seeing it ingame it just feels a little off to me. I can't explain how. Still, I'm really happy with the direction they've been taking with outfits recently; the Bog Wanderer outfit is so good that I occasionally swap out my TFJ for it, and I spent a year farming to get that thing.
---
JUNK WALLS, Im so excited to get to use those again, Im sick and tired of having to make my own makeshift ones layering fences and slabs of wood to make them look dynamic!
---
Thanks for the help but I‚Äôm on ps4
---
Thank you so much!
---
over 2k hours in game get pissed off everytime I play at something just about.
---
because I love Fallout, I played 1,2,3, even new vegas (wich is NOT a fallout game), and 4. I have Fallout 2 installed and have a play through in progress on ever machine I own.  I like the idea of being able to interact with other people in the world but most people seem to play it as all the other games in the series, a solo game.  I actually preferred only the robots being NPCs, as the current quest givers are just sooooo buggy.  Just about every MMO is full of glitches the first 2-3 years, I am used to glitchy MMO's I played WOW for years, literally my playtime was in years on more than one toon when I quit.  I am hoping at some point the devs realize they need to quit trying to add shinny stuff to the game, fix the bugs (Hello whoever is responsible for VATS) and treat the game like something that can progress with time. We potentially have 57 playable years before the events of Fallout 1, I would like to explore the universe for some of that time but the devs gotta pull it together fix the game killing bugs that are in the game and then worry about adding new stuff.

I emote for people to come over, and once the legendary enemy has about 2cm of health left, I just finish it off. What's worse than someone one shotting it is when one person kills it then everyone acts like they don't know where it is. Someone does and *I'm looking at you*

Oh dang, its a pretty good one too based on the weapon pricing site, too valuable for me to just throw away but most people want a junkie or bloodied gun so it just collects dust
---
Yes. ‚ÄúFix-It-Good‚Äù
---
Sadly not bizarre when they can charge you later for it. Junk walls is one of the most requested items, so it‚Äôs no coincidence we‚Äôre seeing it shortly after the atom spigot has been turned off.
---
Ah yes, the shadow world. My favorite part of Fallout.
---
Came across a dude who was clueless during RR. Me and another guy were emoting like crazy next to the legendary and this dude didn't come over even after like 30 seconds of emoting. me and the other guy were bloodied and kept getting downed while trying not to kill the thing. Eventually just gave up and killed it.

4.
---
I'm all for helping people. I do it often, on here and in-game.  What I don't get is the inability of some to figure out their problem themselves.  Google exists, and you already alluded to the fact that just by simply exploring they can find what they're after.  
---
Just by reading this sub and utilising Google has meant I haven't had the need to ask anything in this sub.  Iirc I've posted a question once, and that was only after making sure I couldn't find the answer by other means on my own.
---
True!! I don‚Äôt know if having a gun with lvc is the deciding factor? Because I only tested this on my b2525 handmade. The reload is insane!!!
---
Yeah, that was the original intention lol
---
They were to protect games during Satanic Panic
---
Of course not.
---
Lol. Played a lot of that but don't remember the dialog anymore.
---
Ubermensch in German is more or less superman.  Ubermilch (or melch I suppose) would be the same but with milk.  Thought it was funny but if that is the actual line it's even better.
---
Same problem here. Picked up two with no completion. Even picked one up in NW and still no completion.
---
Grelok is mocking me with his smug aura.
---
You def don‚Äôt need refactor could use a point for lvl 1 tenderizer for more damage output
---
Also stop adding stuff over bug fixes, theres too many day 1 bugs like this still in game.
---
im glad  its not worth it   just use 4 bullets to kill something instead of one
---
Oh No! the [Dread Gazebo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_and_the_Dread_Gazebo)
---
My opinion so far from only 1/3 of the way through is remove most of those cosmetics. Instead, give us more currency rewards but less of each to balance it out. Give us caps, atoms, bullion, scrips, lunchboxes, scrap kits, repair kits, scrap boxes, and card packs. Add a few different or more useful items like chems, grenades, and ammo boxes (similar to how the scrap boxes work). Hell, add treasure maps and miner keys to make those mechanics more relevant. I would rather be showered in currencies that I can spend at free will than get random cosmetics that don‚Äôt fit my character build. I don‚Äôt mind a few cosmetics (like every 20 levels or so). If they are season themed, than thats fine with me. The random stuff just isn‚Äôt worth it. As long as they give enough atoms to allow even a casual player to buy a cosmetic once in a while, I think that would be more valuable.
---
Yeah I regret doing so.
---
100% Yes.
---
When choosing what build to use, I say that you should choose whatever is most fun to you and would allow some diversity to spice up play styles. I prefer some automatic and some long range sniping action. 
---
My biggest recommendation, however, would be to take some of the levels out of ranks like rifleman 2 and 3, expert rifleman 2 and 3, and others where the bonus diminishes after the first rank. If you get rank 1, that‚Äôs 10% boost; if you get rank 3, that‚Äôs only 20% boost. IMO it‚Äôs much better to spend these two extra points per skill somewhere else, like tank killer, damage reductions, or other cards that fit your specific play style. Happy hunting!
---
Sounds like you're taking this too personal. As said above, you and your friends are toxic players. They're toxic players for cheating and making effort that others put into the game mean less. You're toxic for celebrating that cheating is allowed in the game.  
---
What's hard about this to understand? You and your friends are trash gamers ruining the game. Congratulations?
---
I didnt say that stagger and cripple do stack. I meant that while someone is staggering her (she raises her chin over and over) u have more time to kill some mobs. Of course she still gets damage but less damage bcz of distance.
---
Don't worry, he probably has plenty more where that came from.
---
Okay, so if he‚Äôs actively trying to sell them for that price, that‚Äôs odd.
---
I don't think they drop at all anymore.
---
I have one  osmosis kit I wouldn't trade for anything.
---
FWIW, the junk items still work you just have to make sure not to scrap them. Keep them in a display case.
---
Have you used the plan it gives you?
---
It doesn‚Äôt auto teach it to you, will be in your inventory.
---
Looks mostly like mine, I also run a PA junkie's heavy weapons build. Looks good, I think you will enjoy it.
---
I run through the vault tek farm at flatwoods everytime i spawn due to farming screws and lead. I often find a bobblehead (or even two) during a search.
---
Love it!
---
Well I feel stupid. I read over armor and only saw power armor haha
---
Autumn Acre Cabin on the table inside, Seneca Gang Camp- don't remember where it usually is, Toxic Larry's can be on the roof or on the lowest level, Sludge Hole near the fridge, North Cutthroat Camp - I found mine at North Cutthroat Camp on the watchtower above where the Tinker's Bench is at. 
---
I know that these are reliable spawns, because one of my characters camp in that area, and I used to run to all of those places to collect supplies.
---
And that is what I do as well. But not everyone is the same. 
---
95% of the posts in this sub could be solved by a Google search. 
---
Don‚Äôt let it stress you out.
---
I think they‚Äôre referring to the Ghillie armor skins not the NW ‚ÄúOutfit‚Äù that was given away in the last NW Event.
---
Yea, they should make it where:  
---
1\* enemies could drop 1\* or 2\* gear,  
---
2\* enemies could drop 1\*, 2\* or 3\* gear,  
---
and 3\* enemies drop 2\* or 3\* gear.  
---
With a higher chance of the drop being the same number of star's as the enemy(example: 3\* enemy have 60-75% to drop a 3\*)
---
??? Any build can have a long lasting progression if you want one specifically enough, the reason bloodied is more difficult to obtain is due to high demand because of high effectiveness to difficulty unbalance so there are less of them floating around than scrip-bin legendary effects. If bloodied was normalized and other builds brought up you'd start to see a lot more legendaries of all kinds on a more similar price on a more regular basis.
---
Other builds don't need to yield the same level as reward as bloodied, if they do then the game will become even more of a joke in terms of difficulty and the only things left would be the frustration of everyone one shotting everything even more in a game that's rooted in multiplayer and cooperation.
---
Nearly all build types already have something they can aim for in terms of armor and / or support, bloodied is just so far beyond anything else in terms of effectiveness they haven't been explored, junkie is more reasonable because the benefits of increased damage comes at the cost of specials reduction instead of having every specials in the 20ies (and more interesting due to the player choosing which negatives they want) and its damage increase is still less but still powerful enough to make a significant and rewarding impact. Though it's still unnecessarily strong when paired with sneaking.
---
And yes bugged weapons are yet another issue that plagues this game, just like legacy weapons, they should fix them and change legacy weapons (like changing explosive to firerate since that's an effect that's roll-able and doesn't bring the weapon's damage sky high).
---
Just waking up......annnnnnnd not yet
---
When she is at 5 percent all i do is look for that sneeky bugger.
---
Yes I have it‚Äôs not in my inventory anymore
---
Actually It's a poor pricing tool. Doesn't reflect reality most of the time. It's not even that good for a ballpark figure.
---
You're best off seeing what others sell it for at various trading sites &amp; in game &amp; use your judgement.
---
Very Very odd.
---
Gotta get some mileage out of my Quack Surgeon perk. Nothing like pouring some alcohol on your wounds to get you up and moving.
---
Lmao
---
Is it a reference to ‚ÄòMayor Lou‚Äô?
---
Do you have all the materials required to make it?
---
Imagine unlocking the Captain Cosmos PA, only to *then* have to grind ~7000 Gold Bullion to buy all the pieces to actually build it. lol
---
I don‚Äôt know it says I don‚Äôt have the plans for it after I already learned it?
---
do you jump around a lot? I found that my bag spawns in midair if I die in midair. I have marsupial so it tends to be quite high up.
---
Have a turret set up IN my Brahmin pen, and was there while dogs started attacking. Turret's like, yep go for it" 
---
what are you even here for turret?!
---
Classic "can I copy your homework? Yeah but change it a bit so it doesn't look obvious you copied" meme
---
Someone did that to me yesterday at the Sons of Dane Grendel event. All that time spent and they didn't let anyone else get over there.
---
Hmmm, so like a paralysis blade from Elderscrolls game? I could get behind that. Maybe add fusion cells to keep it fair and would cover the charge cost? Think it be funny to be reloading your cattleprod to stun Mutants so that they just go "Hrrrnnnngg" as they fly back hahaha
---
Additionally:  
---
I realized it only happens indoors, and in power armor. And when I switch a weapon i can immediately move but if i stop, WASD acts like not pressed.
---
Very odd... Sorry.  Never seen that happen.
---
You have no bear arms so if you want to carry a lot of different heavy guns your gonna have issues. 
---
Glow sight is much better then refractor. 
---
Your endurance perks Isn‚Äôt bad but I would use life giver with chem resistant. Fireproof is great if you have explosive weapons.
---
Power user is not needed if your using batteries included. Better alternatives would be reduce dura or nerd rage.
---
Adrenaline doesn‚Äôt need to be at 5 stars just 1 star is good enough. Those other 4 points could have better uses on other stats. 
---
Luck is all fine. One man army is pretty questionable atm since SBQ can‚Äôt be crippled and mobs die too fast for it to matter.
---
Edit: didn‚Äôt see you were going junkies. Nvm some of this. Chem fiend is a great one to have then.
---
Leave no dwarf behind!
---
The foundation piece should be able to sink fully into the ground, especially on uneven ground
---
Lol right
---
Wow, I just got the raider tree.
---
That's so F'd. I hate people like that who want to ruin the game and be 'better' than everyone.
---
Do they all make the same thing? Or is helmet each giilied out?
---
It's quality of life perks that are great. 
---
Things like green thumb and travel agent are great low investment perks.
---
When tanking the queen sometimes I see a downed player and no one helping so I just go do it myself while being battered, fun times :P
---
Some of the text came out weird, my first time posting here and it is all cut and pasted from word.  So special looking text is not special only bold is special.
---
What perk is harmful to junkies?
---
Some people doing the actual duping aren't getting banned. I think you'll be fine
---
Cut your teammates some slack. A lot of people don't have enough charisma to share more than a rank one perk, and then they've got to have a rank one perk in their build worth sharing. I suspect that's why Travel Agent and Strange in Numbers are so popular as shared perks. Then there's people like me, who either have build-specific perks most people won't need or already have (Incisor, Blocker, Bloody Mess, etc). 
---
Personally, I share White Knight since I don't think everyone equips that perk for general use, and it's beneficial to anyone wearing armor and taking damage.
---
They all turn into sentry bot helmets with the skin I think. I used an eyebot head myself and it just turned into a sentry bot helm underneath.
---
There is a Character in the Wastelanders quest line named Lou, and without referencing it (at least so far for me), he has a solid, old school Baltimore accent. First I've encountered in any of their games so far.
---
You won‚Äôt be seeing anything Near that for awhile with all the duping.
---
As for strenght i would use Bear Arms and/or Blocker
---
Be grateful peasent or the mighty Todd will take away more of your challenge score !
---
It sucks but you can instantly rebuild by interacting with your CAMP unit, unless you want to relocate, then yea I'd understand.
---
Yea it's normal for high end gear but every now and then I see theese prices on random nocturnal gear and I just laugh
---
Did my buddies trading guns between themselves really bother your gameplay? I guarantee you that most good things you have have been duped. Stop acting like you‚Äôre so high and mighty. You have no right to judge people you don‚Äôt know. You disagree with their gameplay choices, fine. The guys that ruin your gameplay are the guys mass duping with intent to sell. If you think the game is ruined due to their actions, you really aren‚Äôt playing the game for what it is. 
---
You can call them toxic players, but *you* are a toxic person.
---
Isn't it a season reward?
---
Thanks!  I got some great junkies heavies recently and I decided to make a build with them.  Now I just have to make it to lvl 50 so I can use my powerful stuff.
---
Go to Big Bend Tunnel, the side tunnels are full of brain fungus and glowing fungus. While you're there, start Ridin' Shotgun. Have fun, don't press the button to open the gate though, let the brahmin heal up, and don't be the guy who shows up and pushes the button while other players are off looking for the crates. Don't ever be that guy.
---
I find I often race other players to revive downed players. Makes me smile.
---
I cannot un-see the cat, it's all I see when looking at that pic.
---
That means a nuke was recently dropped there but it's over. No idea why this makes level 1 diseased eyebots appear but I've seen it multiple times when farming the nuke zone up until the very end.
---
ETA: sometimes happens at SBQ nuke sites too. But not as often.
---
That's Bethesda's attention to detail for you there
---
Just found one at Sweetwater's place. Thanks!
---
Doesn't party girl keep you from getting addicted? Maybe I'm thinking of something else.
---
If you actually have that much to sell, which must mean you play the game too much.
---
I share scrapper because who doesn't like more junk.
---
Its sad that 50 is low.  Lol
---
Personally it spawned for me near Sunrise Field, in an unmarked place southeast of it. 
---
This video helped me
---

We aren't talking about the ghillie suit, which isn't part of the Legendary Run. We're talking about the ghillie armors.
---
They will have the small red chain link in the upper left corner if they are shared, for clarification.
---
Bloodied is some poo poo butt butt
---
I saw some one do it my first weekend playing in Uranium fevor, since then I thought it was just standard. Well I did get like 2 instance of Uranium Fevor where no one did it, I did a angry face, and next thing I know every one but the guy killing the legandary on site was doing it, and next one who spawned he didn't kos lol
---
Like now with my op shotgun I go up and bash it with my butt stock instead of shoot it for almost no damage as I do the follow me emote.
---
The Pastor's Vestements go with it pretty well, but there's a costume that goes with it.
---
I‚Äôve seen many dupers who duped loads and also used XP glitches be unbanned. Shitty on Bethesda‚Äôs end that they‚Äôre such pushovers. You can act cocky now but chances are when you were banned you were sobbing. Assh*le
---
Maybe let‚Äôs not have another season and just go back to atom dailies
---
Yeah i had a dude camping the tunnel the entire time so i just left. I wish there was an ignore function so i could not be put in the same world as those people.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm both rifle builds it‚Äôs be 3 ranks of each damage boost and tank killer. Yeah. I like the Gauss weapons but I‚Äôm so far from the Minigun.
---
I'm going to start spreading this and hope that it becomes a D&amp;D urban legend. lol
---
There is no need for legendary power armor pieces. U have an excavator pa with 2 hidden legendary effects. 
---
I say u more: it could be a secret for u but weapons without any legendary effect are quite usefull as well. I reached lvl 120 with my hunter rifle and stealth build. Every shot was x2.5 and with all perks equiped I was able to oneshot every common mob in vats.
---
p.s.: i saw some legendary pa pieces but i guess they are hacked. dont know actually how it was possible.
---
It's all the lube. Those post war Appalachia folk do weird shit with dead animals.
---
You‚Äôre moma
---
Thanks for the input, I‚Äôve got three primary guns for a total weight of about 55 lbs, j/e/250 .50 cal, j/ffr/fr flamer, and j/e gat plasma so I think those three will be good enough.  I‚Äôm a commando on my main and used to carrying 5 rifles with no weight perks so I‚Äôm gonna try this way but also thought I may need bear arms.  I also planned on using glow sights situationally, I just wanted 3 stars in perception to pick locks.  I wish power armor had a slot similar to biocommesh so I could get rid of chem fiend.  
---
I appreciate you taking the time to look at my build.  Thanks!
---
I deserve down votes for that atrocious sentence btw.
---
Very true - and I'm not trying to bust balls just trying to help everyone understand what is most helpful. I couldn't find any threads dedicated to it so thought I would start one.
---
If that worked, I'd just start dropping a $20 and picking it up and become a millionaire!
---
Didn't you already have better items?
---
I got better stuff than you:)))
---
I went to whitesprings and just picked the flowers, it counts, and there are many times more than you'll actually need.
---
'AMA' as in 'Against Medical Advice'? Or does this stand for something else? Sorry, I'm old.
---
Lol
---
It's not perfect, but I think it's appropriate for someone who is new to the game (or is not into trading) to get an idea whether something is scrip, worth a few thousand caps, or trade only. The game is in constant fluctuation with glitches, duping and "magic" weapons that do much more damage than the numbers actually show. The majority of players are not interested in hardcore trading and watching the market/discords closely 24/7. What is a God roll today can be rendered useless tomorrow. For a typical player who just wants to know if they should shell out 5k caps at a vendor, it's perfectly fine.
---
Encrypted also drops repair kits, and you need to be quick putting the flux in a survival tent otherwise it deletes itself when someone kills you!
---
Yeah. I was trying to get at least 5 so I could have max picklocking.
---
I hit my tent before she even hits the ground dead. Flux far more important to me than the shit legendary drop I‚Äôm probably gonna get lol far too many times I had to see the pack vultures run away with my flux when I get killed on that last wave of adds
---
Always:))), the community is terrible so is funny
---
Exactly. We really dodged a bullet on that one!
---
Those are pretty cheap depending on the effects.
---
Ask me anything :)))))
---
Just have it hard shock and burn out a fusion cell as a special "power attack" function. 
---
With standard attacks this would be more like the security baton, it's only a full force and fully charged attack that would actually do significant damage, just like an actual cattle prod.
---
We gotta put pressure on them to bring them back. Even if they wanna do it in a different way
---
That'll only cause enemies to be more of a bulletsponge, won't do anything about the star drops.
---
I run bloodied, and the worst perk people share is rad sponge, and the one that causes me to auto use a a stim at 20%
---
I have everything I duped:)))) I have better stuff than most of the Bethesda fan boys cause the rng is terrible
---
Thanks, I always want to find a way to use blocker, when I‚Äôm out of PA I can use chemists backpack mod and slot that in!
---
üòéüòéüòéüòéüòò
---
Remember you‚Äôre not ganna be picking locks the whole time so just switch the perks in when you have to
---
Wtf?
---
Literally did that an hour ago during a rad rumble event. some level 40 got down at the crossroads of the irradiated tunnels and i ran past the firing line that was defending the scavengers and revived the guy, felt like i was in Vietnam or something with ghoul body parts flying and explosions left and right.
---
Please dont.
---
It takes a crazy amount of time to make any worthwhile amount of ammo. Better off just farming lead in that time fr lol
---
I always figured it‚Äôd be a machine where you put in bullets and it converts it to your specified ammo. Even if you put a cap on it, you really shouldn‚Äôt have to sit there and punch in every 20 stack of ammo you want to give and receive, it should be passive.
---
This game is already enough of a chore hahah
---
Actually put the train on the tracks!
---
I just recently discovered that I can put my blueprints down in NW, so of course I put down [Settler Wanderer's Pavillion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YTjEIwu9LUjNYLp8EE89PUwOwAoBkkku/view?usp=sharing) in the  middle of the road - without her and her guitar of course.
---
I wound up making it to the last 3, me and a team of 2.
---
You can buy them for 250 caps from a vendor.
---
Cause the player base in the game is cancer and glitches will always win
---
My favorite weapon in FO4 was the modded 2076 World Series Bat that would occasionally fling enemies out of the park.
---
That was incredibly satisfying.
---
Buy ranks for atoms, or by exploit
---
Are you joking me.. They still haven't fixed that bug. Bethesda are a joke
---
What's your favorite duped item?
---
True. True. Though like I said if I do explosive they only thing I‚Äôd be using is the Auto grenade launcher.
---
I share Lucky Break on my one gal. I don't have enough in charisma to share anything else. And that's my lowest ranked perk.
---
It's a Bethesda game, so it's just kinda baked in at this point for me, since it's been...18 years at this point. Some of us have probably raised kids and sent them off to college by now.

&gt;  Noone should just be gifted everything in the season pass.
---
They paid for the game. They should get in-game rewards. Bethesda shills are so canerous.
---
&gt;If you can't get on enough to get the rewards, you shouldn't expect to be able to get them.  
---
Imagine being this much of a shill.
---
If you want to make friends pretty much all you have to do is talk to people, almost everyone I‚Äôve encountered has been very pleasant and more than willing to help answer questions of mine. I recently got to lvl 108 after the double xp weekend. Also what platform are you playing on

Glitches always win cause I‚Äôm god mode shooting youüòéüòéüòéüòéüòé
---
When wastelanders came out, they adjusted the glossy effect from rain and for some reason went way overboard with it. Prior to that update, it looked more like what it did in FO4- still not the best "wet effect" in a game, but much better and less extreme than what we have now.
---
Honestly it sounds like hes just saying this stuff. Like it's all a lie for attention
---
But whatever. He can act like a fool, not my business
---
Can you nuke Foundation? Because I really want to nuke Foundation.
---
I spent an hour and a half waiting, this is false!
---
Nah you will get drop base off your lvl
---
No more lvl35 legendary drop off uranium fever etc etc
---
And that's probably why all the new stuff is instanced and untradable, like SS armor and gauss weapons. Can't wait to see what the BOS introduce.
---
Maybe you should spend some time outside and socially interact with anyone
---
we need only 1 bobblehead:) but good to know that these maps are not complete.

For real lol finally got a nice roll on on a bloodied ffr explosive handmade but im a fullhealth pa shotty/heavy. I get so many flintlocks from her its sickening i just found the cool tunnel under her place that was cool oh snd a holotape about a shadey deal.
---
Season score. They are easier and keep me engaged with the game longer.
---
If they make atom easy to attain, it will devalue the quality of work put into the shop. The game needs to hit a perfect balance of "worth investing money toward" and fun. Which leads me to a point no one seems to grasp.
---
The more we cry about score, the worse the rewards will be in future seasons. Mark my words. The game needs to do things to entice micro transactions. It's how they fund the paychecks and insurance policies of the people hard at work in the company. We don't need more free stuff.
---
Atoms
---
It's a shit event anyway, a cap of max lv 40 drops, and it rarely spawns all 3 legendaries. People just rush to it because its easy.

Has anyone ever told you that you're really cool?

Holy shit my TSE [50.cal](https://50.cal) Re-loads like real fast, but I did a little test if you equip it then re-load it speeds up, but it then works when you un-equip it too, and also if you put the mines back in your stash the re-load speed still works :P, if you re-log then you will need to re-equip for the effect to work again, thanks for the heads up see how long it lasts.
---
Same. Didn't work for me either.
---
or how about the black powder weapons/dragon. Might make them actually viable lol

Ok. Let‚Äôs say you and I both put a camp in pretty much the same spot. What happens if both of us log into the same server? I have found a few really great spots so I assume everyone has put a camp there on every server. 
---
I guess I am just used to other online games where servers have thousands of users online, not 24. And maybe the map just seems small since you can teleport so easily.
---
Things I wanted:
---
A Jangles plush we could actually display (Although that Sheepsquach was adorable.)
---
Zorbo outfit
---
Posters of Captain Cosmos comics similar to the Grognak ones that were previously released.
---
Weapon skins that are more "space" themed  (For plasma or guass weapons)
---
Captain Cosmos flag.
---
I did like all the Raider themed items, it just seemed weird for this theme.
---
Hubris Comics neon signs.
---
works for my [50.cal](https://50.cal), I will try my mini gun tomorrow.
---
Right now I'm with my boyfriend. We only have one PlayStation to play on. We only now saw that was the daily. So now he has to spend a couple hours trying to find it AND finish his dailies. Then I have to spend God knows how long trying to find it and finish my dailies. This is a crap daily.
---
I think it‚Äôs going to be free with the meat week stuff but don‚Äôt take my word for it
---
I know of the in-game character. I thought perhaps he was a reference to the real world person from the Baltimore area known as ‚ÄòMayor Lou‚Äô.

---
Everyone and their dog has legacies
---
Even before the dupe they weren't rare. I've got like 20 different legacy variations of a gatling plasma I collected. They aren't as rare as most people make them out to be. All the dupe did was make the more powerful ones more widely available
---
Its only the leather one I saw issues with. I use the combat ghile with zero bugs on it. And I didn't mind it at all. But I was a new player as of the summer steam sale, so to me gold bullion is this magical currency I don't even farm yet lol. I mean I already got a full set of ultracite on 3 toons now since its every where dirt cheap on camp shops as well as it drops like candy from the nuke events.
---
lol sure kid
---
And? Again, you're not saying anything I give a shit about. I didn't know this was a race.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if it shit or not lol

Ah shit my vendors screen glows shit how long till I get banned

I GOT LEGACIES YORE MAMMA

They should be free considering it‚Äôs just a port
---
r/neckbeards COME GET HIM
---
And actually help out players suffering with this, figure out a way of crediting missing score, or pay us atoms to purchase the missing levels! Bethesda customer support has been abysmal about this, auto locking every ticket I post, this time I didn't even get an automated response, it just got auto locked as soon as I sent it!
---
Thats ok.  Once RUST comes out, I may never be coming back!
---
probably getting an entirely new currency
---
YORE MOMMAüòéüòéüòé
---
Is that actually the right English? It sounds right, but looks wrong. Isn't "an" only used if the next letter is a vowel? Or is it based on sound?
---
How did you spell it wrong twice?
---
Playing on PC. Is a mic the only way to talk? I haven‚Äôt found a chat window.
---
The biggest problem is the lack of 3 star drops, 3 star enemies should never drop 1 star legendaries.
---
I wonder if there will be a shanty town bundle with the prefabs and walls
---
Throwing Knives are a great option as well.

I GOT 700 CROC PLANS, HOES MADüòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòé

That makes sense - thanks
---
Look into the Ludlow Massacre in 1914. Another important and tragic event not taught about, but which changed the course of workers rights in the USA. It wasn't just the mining companies keeping the miners down.
---
Do you have any more to sell?
---
You are right. Thanks Bethesda for every disappointment, almost every step is a disappointment.
---
Finish the vault raid? You cannot buy anything that is not another waste, now grind burilion you dont get nothing, a crappy weapon for script. Here tou realize you need weeks or months for rep and gold.
---
Getting rep? Suddenly you realize there is another level of reputation, more weeks of daylies.
---
Seasons? A bad excuse for taking away atoms from us. I like the season but I realized in 0.5 secs we lost thousands of atoms.
---
Pvp? Sorry, griefing is your only chance.
---
Finally Gauss machine gun? Sorry for you, lets buy all the 2mm ammo in the vendors of all the map because you craft 18 bullets at a time (what a joke!) I dont wanna be crafting all the afternoon for 2000 bullets I wanna Blast like Blastoise. I like spending the afternoon gathering materials but oh my, not spamming Enter for crafting.
---
Gauss pistol? A joke, especially because for Vats, shotgun bugged too.
---
Ammo converter? Tap titans click simulator
---
What I like is the Jetpack, that was genuinely a good satisfactory moment. When you fly for the first time you feel that achievement, that grind is finally worth it.
---
All this new things should be like that.
---
Overall a good game we all enjoy :)
---
Me neither...
---
My alt is a medic build. Shell run through hell to do this. My main will just meet you in hell.
---
you can rename the complete set if you inspect, and then hit V? I think.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I play on Xbox but I would look for discord chats with friendly people, I‚Äôm sure you could even find pc players who will help you with everything on here or recently I started using Twitter and people on there always help me when I‚Äôm looking for anything in the world from lead runs to what perks I should be putting points in
---
Yes
---
Just cancelled to piss off the shills. Can't wait for Fallout 5 to release as a true single-player game so this piece of shit can die
---
You ever put d12 dice in your shoes to do a deep tissue massage? Works wonders
---
Kinda takes away the points of ‚Äúseasons‚Äù if it last for ever. That‚Äôs just adding content, there trying to keep their playerbase numbers up and exclusive content tends to help with that, which is why so many games do it.
---
Seeing as the guy said he doesn't want it. I'll buy some from you if that's okay.
---
Definitely Atoms, Scrapkits are useless.
---
i didnt think about that  thanks

I like the season ones more because now i am doing more dailies than before
---
Hidden stash weight usually comes from gunpowder, circuits, repair kits and massive amounts of plans.
---
Imo if your looking for one particular prefix (instagating) I would roll 1 or 2 star till you get one and then move up this games not a race take your time hop some vendors eventually you'll find one.
---
Look for places that are off the beaten path, not regularly visited, on the spawn lists. You'll have better luck there, rather than going to a high frequency area (common farm zone, popular events in the immediate area, etc)
---
What do you need
---
Kind of looks like an inverted temple.  Instead of pointing up it's pointing down.   With a sheepsquatch idol centered and floating on water.   
---
The interior would definitely go well as a cultist church or something demonic.
---
It‚Äôs been like that for a very long time. It‚Äôs nothing you did
---
They'd rather have a lower RNG on legendary in general so you spend time scriping and spending said scrip. All efforts are you keep you on as long as possible. Time is money.
---
Ok
---
"Will the aliens return?"
---
Nope. But you can stick tree branches in your f.o.v.
---
Violet and crimson. Have you got it?
---
Maybe you should go back to twitter where you troll people under a fake account. Maybe your 'humor' would work there?
---
Damn bro, I‚Äôm pretty sure majority of the people who were banned are getting unbanned soon as I also did get unbanned recently. What‚Äôs so special about you getting unbanned? It‚Äôs not like it was only a small portion of the community that duped a ton.
---
These people are great. Also the people who gather ore in Radiation Rumble. And the guy who motioned me over to see my very first wild mothman and let me have the first shot. Not to mention the guy who gave me 4 nuke codes and a briefcase, then talked me through nuking our enemies in Nuclear Winter. There are lots of good folks here.
---
Love this
---
So I've picked up 2 bobbleheads AND bought like 5 today and it won't complete the daily.. even tried dropping some i had on me and picking them up and still didn't work
---
Edit: found a third and it finally completed
---
They're definitely worse than dupers! At least duping helps the economy.
---
Renaming is the only way

Thanks for the laugh

I used a combat rifle, 10mm smg, AAE assault rifle, and AA handmade and they all seems to hit 115s on ghouls earlier today and I haven‚Äôt noticed any decrease in damage. Even the smg usually hits 57s on bots for me.
---
Thats interesting, im running a bloodied command stealth build and am still 1 shotting A lot of things with a standard 1 star 2 shot auto handmade. Using full commando perks, sandman etc but even my queen damage is soft 60's and crits are about 80-90
---
This led to the uprise of unions which are typically seen as not very capitalistic. Hence an avoided topic in schooling.

Since they aren‚Äôt removing items off the duper‚Äôs just let someone else do it and get the items off them... sad but true.
---
I think they added this awhile back so if you want to take it from someone else you don‚Äôt have to walk up to the workbench. Good info to share though!
---
Ah 8 violet, 10 crimson. I'll take what u have
---
Must've been traveling a little too fast
---
Wow I've only done campfire tales 1 time I didn't realize its potential that's crazy helpful thanks bro!
---
This makes sense, level 100 is exploiting XP or buying the ranks; excepcionaly someone could have make it legally going supercrazy supersayan Xp force, but 95% of levels 100: exploiters
---
Im 60 I think. Lost the first week and then made almost all daylies and weeklies and a lot of Xp of course
---
When you load in it gives you the option to either stay in the server (without your camp placed) or find a new server.
---
And yes, take a break from fast traveling. You miss a lot when you fast travel.

I sell all ammo for 1 cap and I sell at least 20-30k a week easy, but I only sell .45 (most popular sale for me at least) 5.56, 5mm,cryo,.50,plas cart,gamma rounds, and plas cores.
---
I can give you 5 of each
---
Was going to ask you the same question, I‚Äôve only been back like 2months so I‚Äôll have to wait for it to rotated back around
---
no thats a sheepsquatch
---
Yeah sweet! What's your price?
---
This is an AMA, so I have to ask... what empty part of your soul is this supposed to fill? Did your daddy not hug you enough? Did Mommy send you to bed without a kiss goodnight one time?
---
I‚Äôve obtained many from level 3 safes. The cemetery just north of lewisburg has three safes great for farming every few hours if you loot a lot in between.
---
happened to me once, damn convertible
---
Xd
---
Similar to saving challenges someone the other day suggested that in another game you coukd do the previous days and continue till you caught up.  Now i usually hate when people say game X does this so fo76 should but this seemed so perfect.  It would allow a new player start midseason and mad grind to catch up, weekend warriors could get caught up, or hey i didnt have time to do that NW today ill grab it tuesday when i have more time.  Good list my friend.
---
Next season needs rewards that make sense with the theme.  If 15 guille suits is space adventuew they have watch to much "Space Force" on netflix.
---
My new toon is a Charismatic Responder Medic. She shares 3 levels of weight reduction perks, because she likes to take some weight off your shoulders.
---
But my cannibal alcoholic raider will share Last Laugh, because fuck this shit.
---
Just enjoy the game.
---
Atleast GTA V is interesting  üòÇ And has NPCs at release.
---
Maybe they wanted to display the magazine in their camp?
---
Yup.  T-60, Excavator, etc
---
Smh, not even answering my question even though you said this was an AMA üò§
---
I would love that!
---
I'm pretty sure the glitch got patched and that's pretty much what I did in the 1st place. I didn't dupe much. I just got them from people.
---
100 a piece for the violet and 50 a piece for crimson

Try the bunk bed.

Not even if we castrate Todd Howard as an example?

Sweet! You online now?

You might try bluepronting a brick doorway with a halfway on top, and then putting the doorways together.

Haven't tried that, but the porcelain throne grants many bad ideas. Otherwise, none that I've found. Good luck.

You should be able to craft it at an armor bench, If you bought it from the atomic shop
---
556, and 45 will probably be your biggest sellers 
---
2mm has an audience too, as well as plasma cartridges. Just due to the gold bullion weapons
---
EDIT: 50 cal and every ultracite variant mentioned above
---
Look... One of my characters had been trying to sell a 1star Instigating lever for months. People ignored it. Ended up giving it to a new charismatic toon who doesn't specialize in anything (all qol perks). 
---
What I mean is: check vending machines. I asked 1000 caps for it, and it was hardened and silenced.
---
Yeah, this has been a ‚Äòfeature‚Äô for as long as I can remember. The best work around I have found is to stay on the world without placing your camp, then quit to the main menu and wait 5 mins . this will hopefully put you into a different server. Or join a friend on a different server. Not great options, but the best I‚Äôve found.
---
Bethesda banned over 20k people from the player base.
---
Honestly maybe I like the cards but I dont like the system too much, the idea. I have to try it yet tho. So we will see.
---
these and a few ultracite ammos as well, mainly 45 and 50
---
A quick Google search shows that /u/VisceralVirus is actually right. I was thinking the same thing you did.
---
Good advice, thanks! I tell you what though if it were me that stumbled upon it I would have scooped it in a heartbeat.
---
No, I'm really not. Why...why would I be mad? Seriously? Why would I be mad over something so pointless?
---
If you think I'm engaged in this conversation because I'm angry, you've severely underestimated your comedy value. I'm talking to you for the same reason watching Failvideos is fun.

---
That‚Äôs the design motto for this entire game man. Everything looks worse. There‚Äôs just more color.
---
Well, for one, I'm a woman, not a 'pissy boy', and for another, my replies haven't actually been paragraphs yet, and for a third, I didn't realize being illiterate was something to be proud of.
---
But I suppose embracing your stupidity is better than being ashamed of it.
---
this is an issue as well. Someone JUST asked this on discord and our reply was the same there, but you've raised another ppint. If the game isn't auto-joining you tro the event that may cause you to not get anything either.
---
James, Richard, and Jeremy
---
If OP has it in storage. Cause the way OP phrased it sounded like what would be the best type to sell so he can convert what's in storage through the ammo converter and make the most valuable type
---
So I left ultracite (until now) off the list
---
My deathclaws die non stop, what level you got; I only find low levels since wastelanders
---
good point, that makes sense
---
Looks like a lot of good stuff! The Green Thumb will still be around when I get my monthly atoms next week but I really want a lot of this stuff!
---
Might even buy that loot bag as I'd really like a skin, the paper bag is so hard to see!
---
Oh that would be nice too I have had those issues too, no problem.
---
Lol yea I‚Äôm disappointed in the captain cosmos power armor big time
---
My main issue is that it replaced the old dailies that I actually cared about
---
yeah but wouldn't that just reduce player population not make the left over population afk 90% of the time?  Also I don't understand because when I go afk I will die from hunger/thirst, but some of these people are just afk for like 2 hours.
---
The vault suits in the NW lobby have that look now too, it's odd
---
Cool. I guess I picked a crappy spot. Never had it ask me that.
---
Yeah the only sense of progress I needed was being able to customize my camp with the atom shop stuff I used to be able to afford every week.
---
This happened to me too and just went about my business cause I was moving junk around on my characters, when I logged into my 2nd of 4 and got the score points for the ones that got completed. Have you tried logging into all your characters? Idk might help.
---
Aah top gear fan I see
---
.38 and .44 are the least popular ballistic ammos. Nobody is likely to buy them from you. If you have the patience to use the ammo converter, you could turn them into whatever you use.
---
Noice
---
After an hour of searching(And also session hopping at the one spot I know they appear, Sweetwater's house) I finally came across one at Alpine River Cabin. My search took me all the way there!
---
"Just equip the perk card" they say, I did and even when I was staring the bobblehead directly in the eyes and turned the volume up super high, I heard nothing! Everything sounded like normal
---
I hate this daily, hopefully it never shows it's ugly head again. Bet there is probably a magazine variant too... oh boy.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Just wait for the new event to come and meat week and stuff like that we will get our old people back to playing I just do my daily‚Äôs and get off now sadly don‚Äôt have much else to do
---
You didn‚Äôt dupe much, not you didn‚Äôt dupe at all. Plus I‚Äôm sure they punished the people who brought the times out of the vendors. There‚Äôs plenty of people who had them drop traded after the fact and never actually did any of the glitch and most of them seemed to be ok.
---
Most people still want to play solo. They just join teams for the benefits.
---
It needs to be said, though, I would not consider it "end game". Bloodied, antiarmor and even Junkie's perform better against big bad guys. People offer any kind of money for Bloodied levers.
---
I've noticed more people just sitting at their CAMPs just sitting there on an instrument. Guessing it's just to stay online so people buy from their vendors
---
And maybe there in a team so randoms can join and teleport to their CAMP free, thus increasing traffic through their vendors
---
Don‚Äôt know why I was downvoted I said I wasn‚Äôt sure jeez
---
Hunger/Thirst being drained to 0 doesn't kill you, just drops your HP down to a minimum of 10.  
---
Also, higher levels may end up AFKing since there is a bit of a content drought for them right now. Many higher levels are just doing SBQ/dailies. As far as AFKing goes, I imagine they're just waiting for their vendors to make a few caps.
---
Also to fix the auto complete bug, that hit me hard yesterday, I lost 6 dailies and 5 weeklies....
---
Yeah, we know these things and it is what it is unfortunately.
---
Idk could be. I heard some people got banned from just recieving items also. I don't know how true that is but I'm just going to do neither if I ever get my account back. I'm done with the trading community for good.
---
Tell me more about the warehouse i think your burying the real story.
---
Yeah should have explained better. I know the rates are horrible on converter.  I want to sell whatever people will buy.  Comvert whatever is left and worth converting.  And then dropping whatever is left.  Thanks for the repliea so far!!
---
All of it is worth while, as there's always someone who needs some kind of ammo (especially with the various buy stuff daily challenges). That said, .45, 2mm and plasma. Missiles and Mini Nukes seem like they should be worth selling, but in practice, not really.
---
But if you aren't selling (most) of your ammo items at one cap a pop, you're not going to sell them much at all (2mm and sometimes Plasma notwithstanding)
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Yeah, afew have been reinstated
---
idk either. this sub is a real mystery sometimes, it's not uncommon to see a comment get downvoted and then a reply to that comment saying the same thing get upvoted. just goes to show that imaginary internet points do indeed have no meaning
---
The only way Bethesda gets any more money from me is if the castration is on Pay per view
---
Glowing meat steaks give you extra melee damage
---
Brain bombs give you xp +5%
---
I'm currently using a fixer and lever action, so .45 are keepers for me.
---
Alright I'll try it, thank you! And if it works ill let you know
---
Some limitations are to really make it more 'survival' like. Such as limited stash space, inventory capacity, thrist/hunger
---
Some are there to force you to login everyday so they up their daily player value
---
Most are straight BS
---
I'm surprised that hasn't been patched out, usually they are very quick to fix any exploits that benefit people. I had it happen accidentally and it's impossible to undo it, so I'm "stuck" auto completing his quest every time. I already reached ally with both groups a while ago, but it's just free scrip/exp every day now. My head canon is it's a daily offering for all my services to foundation
---
YouTube has videos showing full routes of magazine and bobblehead spawns. If you cant find one, chances are there is a guide to help.
---
This... if I‚Äôm healing or regenerating health, FT is a no go... maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence but I‚Äôve also found that holstering or putting away your weapon helps as well. Maybe it‚Äôs just me
---
Not sure if this helps, but I sell:
---
.308
---
.50
---
5mm
---
10mm
---
5.56
---
I would sell .45 as well but I use that ammo type
---
Kill one of the quest raiders when you do not have the quest active, then you can loot the item. It should let you turn in the quest and then not go away once you do, so it autocompletes it every time
---
That's how one got stole out from under me while I was standing at the bench
---
Also great for contesting workshops when someone tries to block the workbench.
---
Yeah I kind of miss the old school guys. Went to sbq and no one was doing damage and keeping her in the air. When she did land, I could do one of 2 things-
---
Freeze her- I'd do this normally with vets around. So instead I did the cheese with magic mini- while was getting the health drop this 55 jumps in front of my gun like going to blow myself up xD
---
I left after the event and blew up his camp.
---
Paladin points?
---
Glow in the Dark Skeleton Mask isn‚Äôt, you have to earn it in Nuclear Winter
---
Aaaand....you don‚Äôt even need a shovel like you do completing Buried with Honor
---
Im always looking for .50cal considering the ammo maker is woefully slow at producing it. I go through a lot at SBQs
---
I think theres a market for gamma rounds too since bloodied often use a gamma gun to adjust rads and its a pretty hard to find ammo in the wild. I put up a few hundred rounds in my vendor as a test and they went pretty quickly at 1c ea
---
Ooh are there still enemies spawning down there? Yeah I'm a full health rifle build atm and my last trade with her got me a bloodied powder gun üôÑ I'm selling it cheap since I figured someone might like it, if anyone ever has enough ammo for those things
---
[Here](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_bobblehead_locations)
---
Happy hunting!!!! Hope it works the 2nd time around
---
Aka free, free is this downvote
---
And instigating
---
Wait until you get into the scrip/treasury note/bullion limits. Then the real fun begins.
---
You're right at one certain point but let's see the other face of the medal, you're facing what the world became after the bombs and stepping by a dead place just because when the world ended you were in a damn safe underground vault, when you see the skeleton of Alisha Parker at Morgantown and discovered what happens in that city and to her and for my point of view it's amazing to just read and hear what happened to her and immagine how the life was painful for her at the time she was alive, then she died out of radiation poisoning like the majority of the VTU students, but something I don't know how to explain but the empathy I had with Alisha I don't think it would be possible if she survived the rads and becoming idk a ghoul with a dialogue box, the fact she died with all of the other ppl in Morgantown trying to tell the story of the city after the bombs make me feel a lot more in the "fallout mood" than anyone npc in the new expansion, that is one example of what the pre Wastelanders can offer you if you just played it a little bit more than the common "loot n scrap" remember that Bethesda know how to tell a story after all, just don't mind the fact you have to grind the world, pick the best legendaries, skins and other stuff that now everyone want only to do in this game, there is still an enormous map full of lore here for you just to be discovered and enjoyed like the other fallout series, and this isn't changed event in this game.
---
If I can spawn my camp in a nuke zone and travel to it, join Scorched Earth and travel inside it, I should be able to fast travel anywhere else in there. If I die, I die.
---
My character only breaks a whopping total of 39 damage while sneaking, that‚Äôs it. It gets a couple hundred with sneak attacks but outside of sneaking all damage is 39 no matter which weapon is used for auto rifles. I really hope it‚Äôs not nerfed and ruining it that much more
---
&gt;Great content
---
Downvoted
---
K thanks
---
Flair isn't a bug report, if you don't submit to bethesda through official channels they aren't likely to address shit.
---
Because many ppl just join groups to activate either mutation or/and Exp card perk.
---
IMO - there are not enough events, oftentimes I open the map and there is like NOTHING to do... Wish events were more frequent. :(
---
The bug makes it so no button press works, can't respawn there or anywhere.
---
The first one I collected worked. 
---
Use [this resource](https://fo76map.com); it may help.
---
Honestly I feel like most of them duped or brought the items out of the vendor during the duping. Other probably lied because they thought it would help them get their accounts back.
---
&gt;FREE
---
I see your two digits iq kicking in
---
Maybe my character is bugged because it doesn‚Äôt matter what I use for auto rifles they all can only do a total of 39 damage per shot on any target, roaches, ghouls, super mutant,
---
Definitely not a nerf. I‚Äôm still hitting everything or 500-1000 damage without crits.
---
I‚Äôve been sharing Good With Salt. Figured it‚Äôs ok for all builds and people may not normally have it on.
---
Swing speed?
---
Well that‚Äôs good for you and your character anything I use bloodied I mean ANYTHING only does 39 damage total per shot (outside of sneaking with auto rifles)
---
Never thought I would say this but I wish we could go back to people complaining about their bans that they definitely didn't deserve. 
---
Shooting ghouls is fun, picking ore is lame.  There's no great mystery here.
---
As a dumbass American English speaker by birth, I know that this was right but I just had no idea why it was right
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Ah that‚Äôs right
---
Still not worse than leather armor with ghillie. I can't believe that not only does this shit get into the game with NO testing, but that it STAYS broken for so long. How much work could it possibly be to move the attachment points and send out a 5kb patch? Pure laziness.
---
Working theory. Everyone who replied to their email and got back a email saying that their request for suspension reversal was denied some how put them at the back of the unbanning line.
---
Starting on Double XP weekend Thursday to earlier today I've already brought a fresh character from level 1 to 200 with score rank 52 lol.. the sooner I get back my original account the better.
---
What I'm complaining about is people exactly like you not protecting the NPCs while people actually get things done.
---
You da real MVP! Got one at the pumpkin warehouse.
---
Glowing fungus grows all up and down the banks of the Ohio River, the main river on the left side of the map
---
Season most definitely
---
Where did you find it? If it was in a container that someone stored it in a vendor that doesn‚Äôt count. 
---
Anyway the first one I found worked. Vault tec ag
---
Yeah it's the something or other that's important.
---
I want that Jangles Backpack so fucking bad.

I want "Respawn in 10..9...8"

Ive been frozen in place in the 3rd person camera, unable to complete the event or loot or anything because of doing the emote once before. Ive never done it since due to the debilitating fear of emoting the incident has left me with.
---
Dont play when it resets get off like 10 mins before it resets  then wait a bit after aswell
---
I just leave the sight off on mine and use the built in reticle that non sighted guns have. It doesn't disappear when you aim like it does when you have the sight equipped.
---
Nope still missing the point
---
Both so you have multiple ammo types so if you get low on 1 switch but the real question is which one to get first
---
i have never seen a vault boy icon for it come up...
---
how close do you have to be?
---
I got on 5 hours after reset, and it was 10pm the night before when I quit
---
Just fuck all those comments who say "easy". Yeah, it's so fucking easy if you use google to find out, but it shouldn't be a daily fucking challenge. I'm almost done with this game's daily limitations, stupid challenges and its blind fanboys.
---
Carson bunker
---
Inspirational; more XP
---
Based on sound, yeah. Phonetically you'd say it like "em" so you you use an. So like youd say "An NPC" rather than "A NPC"
---
I didn‚Äôt rush? I have 250 hours so far and been taking real slow
---
I would say people really don‚Äôt use them, they weigh a lot and most weapons have a better damage output. 
---
Also if it isn‚Äôt, your vender has to be powered on to appear
---
I standing on a roof today and one busted through the ceiling like a reverse Santa Claus.....
---
Yeah most likely.
---
The eternal struggle of mmo games.
---
Casuals: farming is too hard
---
Hardcore players after playing 16 hours a day since launch: I have a perfect set of 3 star gear, there isn't enough content in the game
---
I used to use minnukes while crouched and in passive mode. Sit atop the New River Gorge Bridge and launch mini nukes at new players. No damage, but watching them run around having no idea where they were coming from was a good distraction from the grind. 
---
Now...not so much. Not enough new players to worry about.  
---
Everytime I get them I drop them
---
Note this is for when you die at the end of an event. It's worked for me twice at encryptid and once at scorched earth. Anecdotal, like much of the info on the interwebz, but you do you. An hour and a half, lol, smh!
---
When I was set up a couple days ago, I wouldn‚Äôt have failed to notice the power ü§∑üèº. So I should just drop the nukes and missiles?
---
Fatman and missle launchers are gimmick weapons and I feel confident say &lt;1% of the playerbase uses them
---
Honestly drop them or put them through the converter for points
---
Well there is an idea, I've considered just playing in 3rd person, but frankly I just hate 3rd person during fights. There is just something about the real sights that "it just works" for me. I can get kinda picky about my sights. Lol
---
Only find it wierd that there not a US military version.
---
It‚Äôs part of the end game for me. I went through what these downed soldiers are going through. As a combat veteran it‚Äôs only right. You see a soldier crying for help, you supposed to let him get ionized or swallowed whole by a gulper? Forget about it. I‚Äôll be there comrade! The fight never ends!
---
I hope you're not talking about legendary blood bug or radroach üòÇ
---
I'm going to say no because I've never head of this person.
---
I only waited because people in reddit said I only had to wait, all I Could do was watch as people catapulted my corpse across the map! Or hard reset the game!
---
Shouldnt of told him you were a female, he might hit on you now
---
Or did he already slide into your DMs?
---
Alright pistols at noon you can pick the location
---
Huh? I've never gotten *just* a one star from SBQ. In the 5 times I've been involved with killing her this week, I've never had a single time where I didn't get a 3 star *and* 1-3 1 star legendaries. Usually they're crap, but I did get a 3 star troubleshooters +33% VATS accuracy 2 shot crossbow that is godlike on screw runs in \[name of place redacted to keep people from stealing mah screwz\] where there's a lot of high level robots. Oh and a 2 shot harpooner but I don't remember the other stats. And a 2 star berserker explosive Gatling gun I rarely use since power armor nerfs the damage.  
---
  
---
Is it just the 18 luck I usually have? (15+3 from food buffs) I thought luck really only impacted RNG for looting medkits and ammo boxes, not getting more legendaries.
---
The guys who join my public team for when they encounter a wendigo collosus and spam 'follow me' emote are the real heroes. I switch the team focus from building over to hunting and we go slay that bad boy, then everyone on the party rakes in like 2k+ exp. It's a good time for all.
---
I kinda felt the same way when I snagged a Furious Swing Speed Endurance Super Sledge from someone the other day for 500.  Just one stat shy of the trio of effects that I was looking for in a back-up melee weapon (would have preferred 90% less weight rather than Endurance but hell, for a Legendary that's worth 9-12k according to Fed76, I'm certainly not going to mourn the compromise.)
---
Ive never seen it not spawn all 3 foreman what are you talking about
---
It rarely spawns all three when I do the event even solo on my private server so it's not other players poaching them!
---
Make another character for storage man. Makes life a lot easier, just have a friend help you transfer items or do it yourself, on a private server. 
---
Which brings me to Fallout 1st. People want to say it's a rip off, "squeezing" money out of players. No. Stop it. If you pay for a year, that's roughly .27 cents a day. Wanna pay by the month? .49 cents a day. You get an unlimited junk stash, 1650 Atoms, private servers, free skins, discounts in the Atom shop. So they are in effect giving you 16.50$ in Atoms for a service that is like 13.99$ a month. 
---
That unlimited stash, you can put as much junk as you can haul. Now if you cancel your 1st subscription, you can still access that stash, but you can only remove items at that point. First isn't as bad as people want to think. It's just not popular given the rough go of 76.
---
Found out by accident about this in someone else‚Äôs workshop and it prompted me and made mention of initiating PvP, I quickly opted out
---
I also enjoy hunting players down to get a proper challenge sometimes rolling with a bounty on my head like a bad boy.
---
It depends on your idea of fun. My newest toon wears a full set of troubleshooters and is a responder medic who heals and revives during Encryptid. 
---
Because Fuck those gutsies and fuck the imposter. And fuck AWOL events too.
---
No I am Jk
---
Huh. Well, it was news to me. lol
---
Personally, I think the next Season should be a S.C.O.R.E. vendor so we can ignore the lousy items or the ones we have no interest for.  Also, vendors would allow us to obtain more Bullion, Scrip, Lunchboxes, and Fireworks.  I don't need 8 different versions of Ghillie skins or 7 different versions of Atomic Onslaught Power Armor.
---
I say we duel on the sun, at night!
---
I was server hopping for an hour before one spawned!
---
The rewards are extremely disappointing
---
Yes please, or anything to lock it out of the scrip machine list.
---
For sure! I love the look of the big metal real sight, and I tried to love using it, but the built in generic one just works so much better for me in first person. If you run a PA built you can also see the reticle tighten up more in PA with the stabilized perk
---
Just get the chemist‚Äôs backpack from the raiders.
---
Who?
---
And is he only good on Saturdays or can I watch his channel any day of the week?
---
Something that would make me finally decide on a build :) I currently (and from start) used shotguns...
---
Got this hiding in my stash, almost making me want to switch to rifles.
---
[Gauss II](https://imgur.com/fRhoBF6)
---
No sorry :(
---
As far as I know, farming for a new one is prolly the best route
---
Bastards, I wanted it, they don't deserve it!
---
No. Unfortunately not. üòå
---
D4 have been used since ancient times lol.
---
There's a grain of truth, but it's not the origin of the d4 lol
---
Holy shit your name ü§£
---
Let me keep it real wit u. I do not believe youüíØ
---
Community managers have replied to at least a couple fixer skin posts saying that they‚Äôll bring it to the attention of the team.  That doesn‚Äôt mean anything for sure, but I‚Äôll bet if it‚Äôll make money in the ATX, we‚Äôll see it soon.
---
Look around at any event and see how many players actually use mini nukes and missies. 
---
Yeah...drop them.
---
I honestly don't care if you do or not, that has been my experience with that event. Alas support doesn't care they always lock my tickets.
---
The "average" player will be very strong, at least in PvE with even just perks and a proper build. Ignorance of game mechanics is no excuse to balance everything to the inefficient player.
---
I don't mean to sound condescending, but even my full health tank build can down anything with ease, weapon only being accounted. Because enemies can't get close enough for anything but the damage to matter. I can easily kill most anything without any "legendary" assistance. 
---
However honestly, I am not sure how other people play or feel, but I enjoy becoming powerful in RPG games, and I take pride in my build, as well as research to be as efficient as possible. I am a thorough min/maxer and I understand that alot of players aren't that way, but at the same time alot of players are. Shouldn't Bethesda encourage people to get better at the game, and to become stronger players?
---
Why is every other post here about playing the game whilst hammered? Is this a game for alcoholics or something?
---
I didn't hear her complain, or at least I didn't understand her if she did.
---
I've never seen that *not* be the case in 76. I farm 2 star legendaries because I'm trying to get a 2 shot explosive handmade or lever rifle, and I always get at least one legendary corresponding to the stars the enemy has. Sometimes I'll get a second legendary that's 1 star, but I've never seen an instance where I didn't get *at least* one legendary of the same stars as the enemy.  
---
The more comments like yours I see, the more I'm starting to think the luck stat is having some kind of impact here. I'm pretty sure that's not supposed to happen but since I've usually got 18 luck (I didn't know wtf I was doing when I started playing and dumped into luck for MOAR CRITZ not realizing that's not how in works in 76) and still have 3 levels to go before I can start rearranging my stats to swap luck for perception.
---
&gt;It's underpowered.
---
It's actually probably the best one-handed melee weapon other than the skisword as far as the stats go in comparison, if I recall. It's like 10 or so damage difference, negligible difference at most.
---
Im lookin at a bloodied ultracite laser gat. No something or other, 9000 caps
---
I want to see world bosses, that roam and spawn randomly, like a traveling event, and people would gather to kill a tanky, super damaging boss, and be rewarded with three to five random legendaries.
---
Haha could be true dont reply? Lol..
---
I have a level 70 character with 20 plus score but i havent played a lot. Have basically same chracter as before but havent completed any quests etc yet. Will be much better to be back fully
---
yeahhh but why use cattle prod when the deathclaw gauntlet exists, though I'll say it's fun to watch people wreck shit with it regardless
---
FO4 only had single effect legendary drops.  That's why the naming on legendary effects in 76 can get buggy with some combinations and you end up with Powered, Poisoners etc pieces with the now "minor" effects naming bleeding through and overwriting the prefix naming.
---
That's not true. It's more likely you jumped strait to a bloodied build and never tried.
---
lol
---
Hey, coming back to confirm now atom rewards are working perfectly for me, and even got the ones I had lost. Thanks to all who contributed for this to be addressed, OP more than anyone :)
---
Hey bro u get unbanned? Im still in temp susp and i was 9800
---
megasloths drop large amounts of caps so beth would never
---
I see what you did here... :D
---
It's an exploit
---
Not entirely sure how to do it, but it involves blueprinting the factory at the munitions factory workshop
---
Thanks! I made it, myself!
---
Its an exploit.
---
Nope. I guess even he's not that delusional.
---
Or he could just be gay, and arguing is his foreplay, so I do nothing for him as a woman.
---
The legendary run i believe is what you're looking for
---
It's already in the patch notes for 21 that they are going to fix it.
---
Just don‚Äôt be on the game when the day rolls over and you‚Äôll never get the bug, simple.
---
(For me the day rolls over at noon, I set a timer for 11AM and I close the game and go do something else till like 5 minutes after noon.)
---
Yes it‚Äôs a very annoying bug and it should be fixed immediately, but Bethesda is slow on stuff like that. Till it‚Äôs fixed you gotta have a little self awareness when it comes to the time.
---
It's a glitch people are exploiting, wouldn't recommend doing it.
---
&gt; scrip/treasury note/bullion limits
---
That's what I thought this rant was gonna be about, because it's missing the *real* limitations of the game.
---
I guess but .45 is still one of my top sellers despite me not selling ultracite munitions
---
Reported it there as well, but normally the community is more involved with it
---
Agreed, would be much better with our originals we both probably put a lot of grind in. My main was legitimately level 450+.
---
Ah I see. I‚Äôve been looking everywhere which makes sense as to why I can‚Äôt find much on it. Or the fact it even exists. Thank you, friend, I really appreciate it
---
I did not know that. Thank you, definitely not worth losing all my characters progress :). I thought it was just a new plan -.-
---
I don't like building and usually don't use these unlocked cosmetics and items, but I'm still trying to get as far as I can.
---
I guess it's mostly FOMO.
---
Sometimes event rewards do not appear on screen,they just show up in your inventory.  
---
have not figured out the rhyme or reason, just happens.
---
Perhaps that‚Äôs what‚Äôs occuring?
---
I can move shells, plasma cores, .45s, with the latter as my best sellers. Plasma Carts do alright. Can't sell 10mm, arrows, or .44 that much. .38s are basically worthless outside the converter. I could probably move some Ecm but I use heavy weapon ammo regularly so I don't put them up. 5.56 also don't sell as well as I'd imagine. Lastly, I don't sell fusion cells often, but when I do, people buy then in huge quantities for some reason.
---
Once you strip those little nibs off the end of a Bobby pin you can pick some lower quality locks with just a little bit of practice.
---
Better yet, a rare chance to have Grahm sitting there reading a paper, looks at you and says, "occupied"
---
Very pretty. Almost church like?
---
Me too. I was almost 400 no exploits.. all quests done
---
You have commando or rifleman perk cards equipped ?
---
I have never suffered from the bug, yet I still made this post. Just because a bug can be avoided by some of us, other people shouldnt be punished for something that isnt their fault to begin with. The simple fact is, the bug shouldnt even exist, and beth needs to do something about it. Theres nothing more to it.
---
Try a location at like the wayward or whitespring golf course/ Whitespring station, those are where my camps usually at and I get alot of customers usually hit max caps in a day or two from it if i keep it stocked
---
bruh where tf did my comment go
---
Nope, been checking my inventory and I get nothing.
---
We probably got pushed back. Fine as long as we dont get wiped when others that did waaay more didnt
---
Wow, that's an insane amount of luck! but that's really interesting because mine is rubbish, it's on 4, and I wouldn't even try farming for two stars, I might get one for every other three star creature and I've never seen a three star drop in the wild, I've had to purchase every single one - in fact I'm not even sure I want to know if three star gear can drop, the answer might be too upsetting lol
---
Many folks choose to visit vendors that are well-stocked, hundreds of chems or thousands of ammo rounds. C.A.M.P. placement may also be a factor.
---
You need to support the stairs back and front. I can't remove my stair today. Then I try adding a foundation in front of the stair. It worked. I wish my description is clear. I'll doodle it if you want
---
Here are the guidelines I‚Äôve been using and been pretty successful. 
---
General rule of thumb: since I can make my 1400 vendor caps quickly with crafting and selling certain items and selling at Charisma 20 (gets you 25% of item‚Äôs base value), anything I sell in my machines I can afford to do so for less than I could get from a vendor. I start at around **20-25% of the item‚Äôs base value**, but will adjust up or down depending on the situation. I also try to end my prices in ‚Äò9‚Äô to save both me and my customer a cap worth of tax. 
---
All chems like Mentats, Psychos, Buffouts, Med-X &amp; Fury (including derivatives like Berry Mentats and Bufftats): 9-15 caps
---
Stimpacks: Diluted 4-5c, Standard 9-15c, Super 19-29c
---
RadAway &amp; Rad-X: Diluted 4-5c, Standard 9-15c; RadShield 19-29c
---
Antibiotics: 9-15 caps/Disease Cures: 5 caps
---
Bobbleheads: 29-49  caps, depending on the buff/rarity. For a few like Leader, about 79-99c. 
---
Magazines: 9-19 caps, depending on the buff/rarity. There‚Äôs a few I price up to about 49, though. 
---
Treasure Maps: 29c for Forest, 39c for Ash Heap &amp; Toxic Valley, 49c for the others. 
---
Ammo: 1c per. 5mm, 5.56, .50 &amp; .308 seem to sell well. *(I also put up a sign offering bulk deals via direct sales. Example: I‚Äôve sold 2000 rounds of .45 for 1500 caps. Buyer saved 500c, I only ‚Äòlost‚Äô 300c.)*. I almost never bother with Missiles, Mini-Nukes or 40mm grenade rounds. If I have space, I list them for 1c per for about a day or until I need stash space, then dump them somewhere public or on my front porch. 
---
Plans &amp; Recipes: About 20% of Base Value; less if it‚Äôs a common plan (I only charge 0c for workbenches if it‚Äôs at my camp north of Flatwoods), more if it‚Äôs a high demand (I charge 499c for Marine Tactical Helmet plans since they end up being so useful to craft &amp; sell to vendors). Now, there are some plans that are a lot more valuable due to rarity. The Treasure Hunter rare plans, for example. I‚Äôm still trying to pin down a fair price for those. 
---
Mutation Serums: 299c, but when overstocked I‚Äôll lower the price. Sometimes I‚Äôll have a themed sale. For example, during Meat Week, all my Carnivore Serums are 149c. 
---
Legendaries: Unless it‚Äôs a really good one that‚Äôs in demand, price it at 15c/scrip value.  Otherwise, start on the high side but be willing to drop price or accept reasonable offers.  Or you can get a price check from other Redditors on one of the trading subs. Learn which effects are worthwhile (Bloodied, Anti-Armor, Junkie‚Äôs, Furious, etc) and which are trash (Nocturnal, Mutant‚Äôs, etc). Some are ‚Äòniche‚Äô like Zealot‚Äôs &amp; Troubleshooters). 
---
People tend to want max level armor/weapons, and at least 2 stars as well, so bear that in mind. Even a Bloodied VATS Crit Damage/Fill Lever Action Rifle that‚Äôs only level 15 wont go for as much as it would if it was level 45.  (But still should go for a pretty decent amount; people do buy weapons for their alts or friends)
---
At 15c per scrip value:
---
Legendary Armor
---
‚≠êÔ∏è - 45c (3s)
---
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è - 135c (9s)
---
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è - 360c (24s)
---
Legendary Weapons
---
‚≠êÔ∏è - 75c (5s)
---
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è - 225c (15s)
---
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è - 600c (40s)
---
At least the old raid had kind of a death penalty attached. Maybe they have something in the works (hopefully).
---
No it was sitting outside at Marigold Station :( it actually didn‚Äôt even go into my inventory
---
I never knew exactly where they spawned from (other than outside of that fenced perimeter).
---
Like I said this is the first time I‚Äôve seen it happen. My tent wasn‚Äôt there and I‚Äôm pretty sure I only saw one other player show up through the event. No clue if they had a tent somewhere.
---
Thank you üòç
---
Lucky! I‚Äôll keep looking.
---
Atoms I guess. I haven't really liked the session rewards much at all. Too much ghille and weird colored PA, about all of it for equipment I don't use in the first place.
---
We may hve to wait the full 2 weeks so the 28th
---
I've got a golf club to trade you than.
---
I don't see what's so sad about "rural farmer", though looking it up do you mean the later use for unionized appalachian worker?
---
Chems you're probably only going to be selling to low level players so probably not a huge market (especially so if your camp is not in the Forest)
---
For Ammo, generally only 5.56, .45, .50 sell well, maybe add .308, shotgun shells and 2mm ec for desperate players.
---
With ammo i've found the more you have the more likely you are to sell it as high levels are not going to to a camp with only 100 ammo, have say 10,000 ammo and you get alot for visitors looking for large purchases (i often have people buy 5k of 5.56 ammo at once)
---
Also, might sound obvious, but make sure your vendors have power, or your camp doesn't show on the map.

There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. The addictions I have should be down towards the bottom
---
Ooor, the game could be re-worked so that everyone can get loot from the corpse, regardless of damage dealt.
---
The system we have atm is horrible, and I don't know why people put up with it.
---
Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
---
That's the ammo converter
---
OP is talking about the ammo factory
---
That's sick! How long did it take you to make it
---
Yeah that pretty bad. But no need to pay it any thought. It's gonna waste space in his stash
---
Firecracker mentats are Berry Mentats
---
And some workshops are so hard to find, lmao.
---
That is awesome. How does that res work with both tubes in the top like that?
---
I‚Äôm still in temp suspension too. I think replying does send you to the bottom of the pecking order. Or who know cause I‚Äôm talking with a buddy I was doing the dupe with and his account got unbanned yesterday with everything untouched. His # was 14k something
---
Oh, I know. I'd never seen this meme before, so I was hoping to spread false information that was new to others.
---
I just saw this too when I finally found a plan for Plasma Grenades. Read it. Saw it unlock. Use the bench. Nothing there. Xbox.
---
Here's the correct workaround:
---
* Stay on the world where your camp can't be placed.  
---
* Identify which player is in your spot.  
---
* Via the Social Menu, permablock the player.  
---
* Quit to main menu, look for a new server.
---
The game always tries to place you in worlds that do not already host players you've blocked. This should help.
---
The ghillie suit is the hands down worst looking override in the game
---
Ive replied a few times lol i could be pushed to the end:(
---
I replied to the initial ban email and then again to the appeal denial
---
I hate when they die right when I get there. I always defend their dropped junk until they get back or just pick it up and drop it back to them where there aren‚Äôt other players running around
---
So this is your fault?
---
I adore people like you at SBQ fights and always try to keep you alive for that reason. My char is all heavy guns build, mobs annoy the shit out of me, but when a sneaky little killer clears them from me, you are now my best friend and my metal clad ass will keep an eye out for you in return.
---
No I funded the board game not this trash fire
---
I do
---
I always happy to collect ores in this event. But lately I mostly skip this event because I want to level up tomorrow. üòÇ

Camp Venture has three possible bobblehead spawn points. On the roof of the locked weapon storage cabin next to two chimneys. On the ground immediately to the left of the weapons bench inside the locked weapon storage. On the ground/dirt between barrels while facing the command centre door.

I have a friend I removed from my friends list via a misclick.
---
Have been unable to re-add, and they can't re-add me.
---
Its not the fact your friend was banned, its the friend request system that is fucked up and doesn't work if you aren't on the same server already.
---
Oh it's that simple? Funny my partner just had this bullshit happen after logging in for the first time tonight (7pm PST) LONG after the reset.
---
I did that not too long ago and was freaking out but found it automatically made a blueprint and then I scrapped it down to get all the materials back hopefully it does the same for you
---
Is there a blueprint under your stored tab? Select it and click store, it will break down and give you all your items back
---
They definitely decided that prefabs would replace the "construction blocks" approach for CAMPs, which is a bit limitative for creativity.
---
Yeah. There's no real purpose for one-handers when two-handers or unarmed weapons are basically superior. Though there is a super small niche with the combat knife, given it's a fast swing speed weapon and has a stealth mod on it. Otherwise, what is supposed to be a one-handed weapon's advantage is their swing speed over sheer damage, but players already swing two-handers super fast anyway and burst damage is greater than DPS as far as melee weapons go.
---
What?
---
No enemies i just find it super interesting. Best of luck on your next roll!
---
I only sell plans and I hold legendary weapons for sale as purgatory until I scrip them. I only sell chems that people like getting addicted to like daddy-O, day tripper, formula p. The last big thing is ammo, I set it at 1 cap a piece. Ammos kinda weird, nothing sells each time besides 556 and 5mm. Every other type sells probably once every few days and then I restock
---
So looking at the excavator suit right now it says under the arms that if worn in tandem mining is is increased, so the fallout wiki is either wrong, or they mad a change in the last few patches. Thanx to all for the help. Ps, there is nothing that says you get a carry weight increase tho.
---
QuickBoy? Dont you mean PipBoy?
---
Everyday
---
The pump is strong enough that it isn‚Äôt an issue thankfully. I was worried about that when I was building it haha
---
Still don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre talking about.
---
Thank you everyone I found one thanks guys!
---
Once I had all the parts? A day. I recorded the process, I need to edit and upload it
---
Well I‚Äôve had it happen to me once and that one time it happened I was in game when the day rolled over. Never been on the game at that time again and it‚Äôs never happened to me since. Don‚Äôt know what to tell ya.
---
No, it's QuickBoy. PipBoy is the device on your arm. QuickBoy is the non-PipBoy UI you get if you hit 'V'.

Ok then, how many times do you see bloodied builds in public team vs a support build? An explosive based build?
---
How often do you see non meta weapons sold for prices comparative to bloodied?
---
How do you justify for anyone even remotely interested in making an effective build not using a bloodied unyielding set that yields the best damage output in the game while effectively negating its thematic weakness completely by crouching, and if somehow failing at that, you suffer no penalty whatsoever for dying, removing the "risk" completely in the first place?
---
Besides the suggestions wouldn't kill sneak builds, it would give them a niche instead of being a blanket buff for every single build out there, mostly mostly bloodied.
---
Haha me too plus sent follow ups. All polite
---
Ragechronicles
---
So if 3 players fire weapons the game crashes.  Maybe they will limit servers to have only two players to prevent that from happening.
---
Enclave enticements?
---
This is an aside, but can you pass it over to the team to later on add in an NPC that wears a ghillie suit and for him to have a line complaining about how hard it is to see in it? I think the 4th wall meta-joke would give the community a hearty chuckle.
---
:( I did this by accident today and felt really bad. Sometimes my shotgun does a stupid amount of damage sometimes it barely makes a dent. Today was a damage day.

High chance, they're a new set of Mothman glasses for some kind of Mothman hunter set
---
Thanks for all the feedback! Il get onto it soon as i can!
---
None of this is for season two.
---
Fallout 4 was only 1* legendaries, but the effects were different. For example I remember the rapid effect being a thing and it boosted firerate and reload but now you can get firerate and reload as 2nd and 3rd effeects
---
I‚Äôm level 291. Im a bloodied build like most people these days, changed like 3 weeks ago and unfortunately there‚Äôs way to many bonuses in using this build. 
---
What‚Äôs the alternative I make myself weaker in order to do less damage so it takes longer to kill stuff... seems a little counterproductive. Plus it makes it easier to smash through this season pass nearly level 72.
---
Damn
---
I went to the cabins in the forest as it has a spot or two (or more?). Second server I got one.
---
Chuck the bobble locator perk on as you'll know almost immediately if you need to hop or not.
---
My best Legendary Items have all come from Random Kills at Nukes dropped on White Springs or Harper's Ferry. Cranberry Bog and the SQB are just a waste of Ammo
---
Absolutely. I tweaked onto this as soon as I saw the rewards. 
---
It's obvious they already had the Captain Cosmos stuff packaged up so decided to make it a "space" theme and then jam in the odd items they couldn't package up for the Atom Shop to pad out the board. Just look at the "Dark Matter" skin. It's just a matte black Combat Rifle for crying out loud. Nothing spacey about it. It's just an misc skin they couldn't figure how to sell.
---
I just watched a video on yt memorized two locations and fast travelled between them, if no bobblehead, server hop
---
my expectation is that they will put their mother in a cheap ( negligently run ) nursing home because of their greed.
---
this will be the recompense for raising a selfish child
---
I play bloodied vats crit rifleman and the stealth suit is perfect for a bloodied build. I do Rad Rumble and gather my 40 but the last few times it's just been me and another player so XP and junk farming it is. 
---
I really want to get that rad barrel plan- standing in a lake getting irradiated is  pretty boring.
---
I finally got around to unloading my crap to a mule.

Been going around with 350 out of 366 lb capacity for a long while.

Now I'm at 145 out of 366 and it's amazing.

Oh good, there's more than one then.

To make you feel like u wasted ur time and ammo

nope its around, saw one the other day, but my osmosis kits been snug in misc for months now

Much appreciated.

Aww they kicked out the molerats then. Anyway good luck to you too!

Chem fiend makes all chems last longer, radaway is a chem so you'll recover more rads with it on since it'll last longer before it's effect wears off.
---
Or you could get good at the game. Its not hard to use gun fu + an auto weapon to get tags while the people with the plasmas are still revving up, or use an explosive weapon, or even a tesla rifle. And what's wrong with people having legacies? A lot of people had nothing pre dupe, and now they have 1 or two of their dream guns they want to play with. So what? No need to get butthurt because you missed out on some XP and glowing blood.

on a walk with my wife and dog i pointed at a pile of wood and said "scrap wood"

Try on top of the entrance to blackwater mine, spawn in and run to the building with the robot, you'll see it on top as you're running towards it. If its not there then hop servers, I got it done in like 5 minutes

I very rarely lose an NPC

Cult of the megasloth hq
---
See? They all sound awesome as hell and they fit into the theme perfect. And how long did it take you to think them up? Like 5 minutes? How do employees at Bethesda that work full-time not have ideas like this? It's embarassing.
---
I think lots of MMO's and games involving grinding/repitition are popular with drunks because they scratch the addict itch and are a good time sink while drinking/using. That's just my take on it though. Fo76 is also casual enough to play while drinking.
---
No clue who this guy is. I prefer the Aussie GTA V speedrunner DarkViperAU.

The thorn has one spawn in the tent, it's pretty reliable for me

I'm approaching level 40 with my second character and have yet to get one option for lockpick !!!

i laugh every time i go to open something ...
---
I wish I could tell you what not to do, I‚Äôve been avoiding being in during rollover and I don‚Äôt play NW until all my other challenges are done since doing this I‚Äôve lost none. I lost two in the first week.
---
Out of interest what are you playing on?
---
Yeah, lol. It's my parties' accepted headcanon. A friend of mine who played 1e (90% of his Navy stories were D&amp;D related) told me originally. We actually hang a few on the door when we play.
---
Mine is Sid Hatfield
---
Personally, I just followed the main quest with the responders until I was leveled up enough to move onto other things. The story is a little dry, considering there are NPCs around now, but it‚Äôs essential to the main quests later on and good for gaining levels. Otherwise, try heading up into the toxic valley and doing some of the Grafton quests. 
---
As for ammo, I recommend Charleston fire department or eastern regional penitentiary for lead, look for the workout stations. plenty of scrap and almost all low-tier weapons drop steel. With the gunpowder, cloth, and acid I gather farming steel and lead, I almost always end up with plenty of components to fuel my weapons for a couple days. Happy hunting!
---
Edit: If you‚Äôre still in your 20s, you should be able to still create the build you want, but I would use a build guide or planner so that you know what specials to invest in and what perks to take when. If you‚Äôre careful, you should be able to mold your build into what you want without having to spend too many extra levels rearranging stats.
---
There‚Äôs a 2 week gap between season and I would be fine with them extending it till the next one starts(which might be why they left the two week gap) 
---
However I really don‚Äôt want the next season to be delayed I‚Äôm going to be finished in another 2-3 weeks easy.
---
Harper's ferry will net a dedicated farmer over 200 violet flux easy...but that's about it maybe a few high rad fluids and mass, but no legendaries or much of any other flux.

I've never gotten more than 120 from glassed cavern area.

So is his name Sandman or RageChronicles?

I think I finally found him. He‚Äôs got 15k subscribers and a handful of videos. Might check him out.

My favorites are KevDuit, JuiceHead and Angry Turtle.

Lmao, commando is for auto rifles and yes I made sure they were the proper cards I noticed my weapons ‚Äúon paper‚Äù damage increase after I equipped but the 39 damage will not budge no matter how much or less the number claims to have.

I could not find anything so I got frustrated and logged out but when I logged back in it was all there. I‚Äôm happy that I got my stuff back but annoyed that I had to log off just to get it back. 
---
Thanks for your help!
---
I avoid using one shot legendary weapons at events and wait for others to get shots. The legendary drop is so bad in this game it just feels good to let everyone take advantage.
---
Completely agree, also I want to be able to make certain long life foods and I want a freezer not a fridge.
---
OP - i‚Äôve been living in the Mojave for a couple years now, and while it does sometimes make you wish for a nuclear winter (107¬∞F this week!), it is the true love is my life ‚Äî and i wouldn‚Äôt have ever visited if not for NV. wishing you all the best ‚Äî may your new home bring you the happiness mine has brought me.

Logging off and logging back on seemed to fix the issue and the blueprint‚Äôs showing up now!

Thanks, this was very frustrating cause i went from place to place for more than an hour and when i finally found it ...

Thank you! I put the locator perk on which helped. Found it at the carnival after a few hops.
---
Yep. That worked. Did a few hops with locator on. That did it. Thank you!
---
I used the carnival up north. It took a few hops but finally got one. Thank you!
---
It used to be that way in fo76
---
I think that random 3\* enemies should drop a legendary item ranging from 1-3 stars. Special legendary enemies like the wendigo colossus should always drop 2-3 star items and legendary bosses (Queen, Sheepsaultron, Alpha, Earle) should always drop 3\* items.
---
Thank you! Got one. What a relief! Cheers!
---
Congrats!
---
Would you get banned for it? Because someone built it in my camp today and I just realized it‚Äôs a glitch, thought it was a plan I didn‚Äôt have
---
I was gonna say how crazy that shit was but qhen you know you know lol.
---
Yes, the shop refreshes weekly.
---
Oh yes my characters damage is definitely bugged two shot fixer reads 120 damage per shot and my mutants fixer with auto .38 receiver reads 70 damage per shot and they both only get 39 damage on the same enemies so either bugged or they nerfed the out of them to make all legendary effects and cards non existent
---
Only luck you got against the ghouls is they do trip at times
---
got mine at the pumpkin shed. thanks.
---
If it didn‚Äôt make me overweight I would do it, I tried yesterday and the crawl I was moving at made it pointless.
---
Honestly you should get XP for every piece of ore you deposit, like 200xp base each. You can easily get 40 ore so that‚Äôs like 8k XP plus for most people with bonuses it‚Äôs probably more like 12k.
---
It‚Äôs partially the players bases fault and 100% Bethesda for designing a system which rewards the people doing the easier of the two jobs required to complete the event.
---
Let me guess, you are a narcissistic asshole who has no friends because you think you are better than everyone. You take cheap shots at random people on the internet because it's the only thing that makes you feel good about yourself and it calms the constant rage you get from the inability to actually function in today's society.
---
It's randomly broken. I've found relogging and removing and re-equipping it to be the best 2 solutions, in that order
---
The next time it refreshes should be the 28th. [News](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/news)
---
every time i try to drop my seedy shack it is a hassle
---
hes not the only one, i had powerarmor parts dissapear and 2 of my weps and i dont drop anything trust me i know.
---
I just want the camp items and the assault rifle skin. That‚Äôs it. The rest of it is useless to me
---
They also interfere with VATS, so during Rad Rumble...yeah. They‚Äôre dead.
---
There is one in the Watoga emergency center that has always been a frequent spawn for me. It spawned today.  Was easy enough but I probably just got lucky.
---
Just the SS armor is 4,250 bullion. That is 1250 for the chest piece, and 750 for each limb. If you want the SS underarmor, the SS helmet, or any of the mods, that's more.
---
Imo most people are less likely to visit if they see no weapons or armor. I honestly pad my machine with stuff to draw them in for the sales you are offering. Bottom line just get them there. They might not buy your weapons but if they buy the ammo win win.
---
This is easy. Yes, you and your buddies ruined the online interaction that was supposed to happen in FO76. You all made the time and effort i spent in the game mean less because you douche bags used exploits to imitate the actual effort i spent in the game. You and your buddies duplicated items for what reason? Obviously to obtain an advantage of non cheaters in the game. You all obtained benefits in an online game for no effort while I spent actual time and effort to obtain those benefits.  
---
You and your friends are pieces of trash that should be banned and eliminated from the game.  
---
I am indefinitely higher and mightier than you and your douche bag friends in the relm of FO76. I did not cheat like you douche bags to obtain what I have, while you all did.   
---
You all are trash and shouldn't be apart of the community. It is extremely unfortunate that you duppers are the last of what's left of the community, which forces Bethesda to allow you to be apart of the community.
---
Be happy for a great weapon at the beginning. And scrip it! Lol
---
Sorry Resident, theres not enough scrip in the wasteland to convince me to give up this Legendary
---
You‚Äôre right, it sure was a good‚Äôn.
---
Is that DDR3 or DDR4? Off the top of my head, that's still more processing power than an XBox one S, but you're going to have to have the settings pretty low.

Seems like she‚Äôs a 3* bloodied fixer!
---
What do you mean?
---
Try the diluted stuff it's not as effective.
---
I share level 3 suppressor. Saved my life a few times during encryptid. Or luck of the draw just for fun.
---
Turned mine on for the first time in forever and got a bobble at graft on dam during manhunt
---
Does it require you to target enemies with VATS or pressing the vats button negate the stun even if it doesn‚Äôt lock on into any target?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm 73 atm I level my character 66 times over the DXP weekend which helped immensely I‚Äôve also completed every challenge bar a handful of NW challenges and two weeklies which glitches.
---
I got mine at the Brotherhood vendor in Watoga Shopping Center. Be prepared because its 11k caps
---
If I can add some more that I use:
---
Critical Savvy is a great perk -if your luck is high, more than one point is a waste.
---
At nighttime Mister Sandman will get your bloodied fixer up to 3.65x damage without nerd rage or adrenalin.
---
Eat lots of honey, your AP will thank you.
---
Does it negate being teleported back to where you jumped from?
---
Best to add some mods too which will cost more.  Get the shielded mod for the underarmor, its 200 or 250.  The jet pack mod is nice to be able to fly to high places.  There's mods for each of the other parts too.
---
Wow I just tried it and it worked... This game is broken as fuck.
---
That‚Äôs probably the thing I‚Äôm most excited for too, it looks really cool.
---
ThAnk you sir looks like I got a lot to save up lol
---
There are even more random encounters now, so what might have been a deathclaw, could now be cultists, blood eagles, settlers, or raiders. If you go to the Ripper's alley, and walk straight towards West Tek, there's a deathclaw Matriarch there. I don't know if she's tamable.
---
None at all.
---
I had a similar idea.  My problem is continually grinding and getting new weapons and armor, only to be outdone by dupers, cheaters, and exploiters.  I like the idea of "investing" in the weapons we have available now and making them unique and not able to be traded.  I think it's a great way to balance all the weapons for end game as well.
---
Unless someone who has enforcer and helps you out when you don't have time for mob fight. Also they seem to be using vats as well because their hits are 100% even if they don't touch you. Makes sense mostly to Ghouls because of their weird yellow glowing eyes. Maybe they are riddled with VATS. Oh and about trip I too trip when trying to jump from a small stone. Haha!
---
Professional drinker will prevent you from alcohol addition. Party boy will triple the alcohol effects.
---
Don't have to lock onto anything, just as long as you have the AP for it.
---
i dream of macros for switching cards around.  need to pick a lock ?  click.  ready to go to your normal build again ?  click.  your second build ?  click.
---
i find it confusing that i need to swap cards around to do things at all ... do i know things or not ?  maybe i need to swap my "IRL cards" to understand it

use the hard bargain perk card and take some grape mentats and that should bring it down to around 9k

It was once a thing 3 star legendaries from 3 star mobs, before the great rng nerf of 96.
---
...and can we get rid of the ones that make you search for the source of the horde after paying to fast travel to the event? Those are the worst
---
Just like with many other things in the English language we don't really follow our own rules all the time sorta like the i before e except after c. I used to believe in that religiously.
---
Pretty much yes, visual bugged. Kinda annoying, but I hope they fix it soon.
---
Yeah, look at all the rewards we get for free, rather than useless atoms for garbage on the atomshop.  The lunchboxes alone are worth more than all the atoms.
---
That‚Äôs interesting, I thought this was a random bug but now I can abuse it lol. Thanks for the clarification!
---
Very true. I had to take every single farm I could in FO4 just so they'd send tribute to my half dozen raider settlements because they'd rather starve and riot than grow a tato.
---
What I don't get is the amount of times I've opened a stall only to find eating utensils and food, glass bowls, ladles, etc. Like wtf is sitting in a toilet stall and eating? üòÇ
---
Sounds like a horrible curse. GHOULS I think are riddled with VATS because when they attack they move in weird angles to successfully hit when you jump high and actually miss like a tool assist. As for Svorched I think they have Speed Demon.
---
The extra large magazine has been blocking the gatling gun sights well before this.

They support themselves, they're not even lazy.
---
You act like they are a bunch of primitive animals lmao
---
Fair. But the raiders we meet are led by the ones who fled Appalachia.
---
It seems they at first didn't really believe in the plague, and we KNOW they are ex-Cutthroat, so the logical conclusion is they are outcasts or deserters, and not people who recognized the scorched threat for what it is and retreated. In other words, many may be cowards. 
---
No, Meg probably wouldn't last a night with her bloodthirsty cousins. She tried that and didn't like it. Despite that, she still respected David so much she came running when he called... to NEGOTIATE. 
---
Her attitude is one of an opportunist who was weak, who finally rose when all the strong were no longer a threat. Least that's my theory!
---
Probably an unintended bug, pressing VATS even with no enemies around pulls your weapon out. I think somehow the animation to pull out your weapon is canceling that "stun" when you land.
---
The people who make the cosmetics don't play the game.  
---
The people who write the code don't play the game.  
---
I'm not even sure if the play-testers play the game, if they even exist.
---
Pretty sure if it‚Äôs not in a brown paper bag it is yours.
---
If you dont grab it, someone else will.
---
As others have said, you can have all of them (excert carnivore and herbivore)
---
-and you should, with class freak, starched genes, strength in numbers and herd mentality, there is no mutation you shouldn't have.
---
If it is in a body it is only for you. If it out on open like a shelf it is for everyone but still don't feel.bad grabbing everything. Anything where a menu opens. So creatures, safes and stuff usually with few exceptions is created just for you
---
Ah yes a guy that whines about people tagging him and his wife in a discord, whines about anyone who disagrees with him, and a person that loves to camp at workshops and kill low levels. He‚Äôs so entertaining! He was better before he took his break lol

Now I don't know if it would have been better to have looted and lost than never to have looted at all
---
Makes sense, I always spam vats while jumping and on some occasions I jump high enough to get that ‚Äústun‚Äù land and the animation doesn‚Äôt appear. I thought it was a random bug, but now I know its because I spam vats
---
BOW BEFORE ME!!!
---
I've seen that spreadsheet posted before and I'm pretty sure people have pointed out how it's flawed. At the very least, it's outdated now that we've got extra dailies all the way through instead of for one week to make up for glitches. Just running some quick calculations myself:
---
I'm at 42 with 1650/2025 SCORE, 5 regular dailies and a level up, and 4 weeklies left. The dailies alone will get me up to 44. Now I need 2075 to level up. If I do every daily from now on except the level up, I'll get 2000 SCORE a day, plus an extra 3000 every week. That's just under 1 SCORE level a day with diminishing returns to about 60% a SCORE level at max level. With 6 more weeks, that's another guaranteed \~1.5 levels every week. 45 days left in the season, 2000 a day, 3000 a week, means 108,000 SCORE is still available at base. I would hit level 93 by the end of the season just by doing regular dailies and weeklies, without factoring the daily level I could be getting that counts as two dailies or the 3 level up weekly that counts as 1.5 weeklies or the double daily SCORE events or the final week bonuses.  
---
So, my initial assumption was wrong, but the grind is absolutely feasible and not at all as impossible as a lot of people tend to make it out to be.
---
Oh your that other PvP youtuber
---
More like a 3* Lifesaving chest piece. But admittedly, sometimes a furious explosive grognaks axe
---
Why is there so much Grognak related stuff? The rest of the Unstoppables have basically gotten nothing in comparison. A silver submachine gun skin would be the easiest purchase in the world for me.
---
It just works.
---
Double. Why triple?
---
I got an instigating explosive 15% reload lever action today as a stealth sniper. Was happy. I really wish the 15% reload was VATS hit chance but I'm not gonna be picky when the last 10 three star murgh or whatever their name is was assaultron heads and pipe pistol type rolls.
---
I was in a slump of cards at level 50, then way on up until I was frustrated.  Started another character, got to level 103, now only play my previous character who is 267.  At some point, it all works out, so stick with you character.  You'll have all the cards and be able to move points around.  Since public teams started, I moved points around as leveling up has been easier with bonuses and inspiration perk.

Yeah, I don't have any gripes with their depiction. They're interesting &amp; pretty likable, they're just not as bad as raiders ought to be, they're more like a gang.

Thanks for the heads up
---
Will be trying this on The Dragon tomorrow
---
awesome, but it could do without the bobblehead imo.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Oh well then I really hope it doesn‚Äôt reach the bloodied part, because stimpaks won‚Äôt be enough to save you
---
my location is frequented by local raiders, ghouls, mole rats, radscorpions, Graham and Chally and sometimes wandering raider hunters ... it's a madhouse, but it's flat-ish ground
---
despite needing fo replace walls on a regular basis i really like it
---
obviously i want to make my store easy to locate, but i also need to provide some protection so no one gets caught off guard.
---
putting the "open" sign by the door seems to work, but i do worry it could annoy someone (like you)
---
All. Of. This. Just. Works.
---
Do the scrap kits still not send scrap to the Scrapbox?  
---
Just to the regular stash?
---
Its just 2 single beds, which would be double. Yeah I used the flamethrower trick
---
I'm in 3rd person 95% of the time , only use 1st for select situations. Pretty much all I play are 3rd person games, I enjoy seeing my character lol.
---
so if I upgrade the cpu, i'll be golden?
---
I just got the bunker buster. I should even scrap that one right?
---
For occasions like that, I use Super, and so does she.
---
This did the trick. Thank you!
---
I have seen wendigo colossus spawn at Cranberry Bog few times and i have tried to emote for help but no one has come to help :( Though it was before this latest patch.
---
The light house. Go up the stairs. There's one on one of the window ledge. 
---
Server hop once or twice. It'll be there. 
---
It's not a place many players are around.
---
Oh, they are.  And they are fantastic.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about being greedy, there‚Äôs plenty of loot for everyone and loot refreshes with time and different servers
---
As a beginner, grab everything you come accross. Any food, aid, junk, guns, and plans will be great help to you. Until you figure out what you specifically need and prioritize the things you use. 
---
Also if it‚Äôs your fallout game or if you don‚Äôt know much about the game, I recommend reading terminals and papers and listen to holotapes, they often contain interesting stories
---
It was easier than I thought. Though when I first did it it looked like 1%off so the footboard looked broken. But when I logged on the next day it looked perfect.
---
Should I get rid of the high level stuff like the level 45-50‚Äôs?
---
Got it, thanks. I was playing with a high level dude who killed some big flying thing and it was full of goodies and I felt bad instinctively cleaning it out
---
Fought a Wendigo Colossus last night with a bunch of random people and expended 5 plasma cores and 7 fusion cores for a one star suppressing double barreled shotgun. More like DE-pressing. I‚Äôm completely with you on the RNG being bad. If the boss is 3 stars, at least give us 3 star weapons.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not normal lol
---
Bro fr
---
Grafton Dam has super mutants, and a few extra inside of you do the event that happens there to recapture Mad Dog. It's usually my go-to for 'kill # super mutants', as they seem to be lower level, and I can one shot most of them with sneak attacks.
---
If you follow the road around to the back of the behind the penitentiary, the "yard" has plenty (and three floaters, too). Also some weights for lead and a metal building with workbenches so you can scrap everything you loot easily. Possible magazine spawn in the pulpit in the church? Watch out for the grenade trap in one of the camper/trailers! Some super's are up in the guard towers, and the ones on the ground are all fairly close together, so it's easy to draw too much attention and get overwhelmed when they gang up on you.
---
Also Grafton Steel, around the workshop area. There's some on the roofs and walkways, but a bunch on the ground, too. I don't know if it scales to your level, but that seemed like a very tough workshop to defend. Lots of high level anglers that seemed to zero in on me, despite my sneak perks and stealth armor!
---
you shouldn't. quit now.
---
Is their something I'm missing here? Wasnt there a huge ban wave not long ago?
---
Idk
---
Why would anyone use the perk that makes radaway more effective if this does the same thing and more?
---
Meanwhile I'm constantly running low on stims because every time I start getting more I get forced to fight assaultrons of legendary mirelurk kings and pounded into a fine paste.
---
he charged us $5 !
---
Yes. They were all unbanned.
---
I am. With chem fiend level 3 a diluted takes away more rads than a normal radaway without the perk. Makes me wonder why they even have the perk that buffs radaway.
---
No. That generation of intel chip runs on motherboards that employ DDR3, but also on motherboards that employ DDR4. If it is on the former, you're pretty much capped with what you can do, without replacing your whole computer. If it is on the latter, you can buy more RAM. In either case, more RAM is going to do you a lot more good than the CPU.
---
Well yeah but first of all a lot of gamers are adult age now. I first started games in 2006 with runescape. I know a grind when I see one, as it took many years to get a Max Cape In That game. I no longer want grindy games. Once you spend years of your young life on a grind you don‚Äôt really need any more. 
---
So yeah I put myself on auto-mode when grinding out things I‚Äôd rather not. 
---
Grinding is weird. You can figure out how much XP you‚Äôre getting and divide that by how much you need to get and that equals depression in most cases. So yeah, some mental medicinal aid is required.
---
Workshops arent even efficient. Only do them for pvp.
---
Kinda late to the game bud. This has been dealt with and handled.
---
I'm 78 and a full health build, it doesn't seem crazy a bloody that plays alot is done.
---
I just spam the jump button when I land and i can jump out of the stun
---
Currently, I am on a kick of hunting scorched beast to load up on all the additional benefits that come from cooking them.  Works good for the dailies that require 3 legendary kills.  Love when surface to air even pops up.
---
It's for the daily challenge. Buy 3 things from a player
---
it's for a challenge for score: Buy or sell an item from another player (0/3)
---
Try and get some cool stuff from them. Somebody gave me a scout armor mask for free just for asking.
---
One of the dailies for score points can be to buy or sell 3 things from/to another player. They are just doing a quest basically.
---
Oooooh that makes sense. I haven‚Äôt been doing too many challenges so I didn‚Äôt see. Thanks.
---
What system?
---
So many activities.
---
Well, I haven‚Äôt had this same experience.  Only started taming actually since Wastelanders dropped and I‚Äôve been successful in every tame showing up..eventually.    I never escort them - read that makes it more likely to die.  
---
It also depends where your base is - if you‚Äôre getting hit by random mobs constantly; yeah it happens they will die.  I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù and my Mirelurk Hunter has been there for weeks now.  
---
Ive only stuck to Cranberry Glade, but it can take awhile to actually get a tameable to show.
---
Ps4. Says in in the flair.
---
You basically need to decide what type of weapon you want to specialize in: heavey, melee, shotguns, rifles, pistols, autorifles, and there might be one more. If it is a normal weapons and is not something you plan on using one day, you might as well scrap it. Because of the way perk cards are set up, you really need to invest heavily in perk cards for a specific weapon type for end game. For example, with rifles you need 9 perk cards to increase damage and 3 perk cards to give you armor penetration and increased accuracy. It is difficult to specialize in more than one weapon type late game.
---
You stole nothing from him
---
Well said. It sounds like you and I have a similar gaming experience (I miss those Runescape days).
---
I put em in my vendor for 0 or I drop for noobs. I like this too.
---
I‚Äôm in the 30s now and regret some of the stats, and realize some of the perks like lead belly and other I focused early aren‚Äôt worth the investment once you start getting more supplies. 
---
I‚Äôm just confused on the whole system and assuming I‚Äôd need a lot of levels to make up for those perk choices?
---
Also spent to much into int and charisma but heard that is fixable with levels too.
---
I appreciate the reply and will check out those areas for lead, and will see if I can plug what I currently have into the builder. Thank you again!
---
I feel your pain. Hours spent looking for materials.  What are you crafting?
---
When you farm legendary weapons on a public server it‚Äôs better to have less.
---
I have 3 high radiation fluids - it is not much, but feel free to add me on PC - Eldyrus3
---
I got a  3\* Quad Tactical Double Barrel Shotgun about a month ago and I'm wondering if there us anything better out there.
---
And lots of stimpaks.
---
lol !  i'm usually wishing i could hear an explanation of events, like a tutorial, for some of the more complicated (or spread-out) events.
---
took me at least forty visits to start to come to grips with the layout of Pharma's underground level because i would get killed and spawn in a different area
---
There is a guaranteed spawn on the roof of the lost home in a box. Unless someone has gotten it that's pretty easy (assuming you are high enough level). That's where I did mine and it took 30 seconds.
---
Alright so I was thinking rifles. What perks should I use?
---
Bloodied or commando stealth. Or bloodied commando stealth
---
They're working up to it.
---
After level 50 you can choose a perk card or a respec point. You‚Äôll still get perk packs every few levels.
---
Oh so I can still go for fun perks right?
---
yes
---
Welcome to the Wasteland!
---
After 50 you will have a choice every time you level up between getting a new perk card or moving 1 special point. Every 5 levels after 50 will get you a perk pack as a bonus.
---
However, by your mid-thirties you should have a pretty good idea what you want to do with your build. Even though you can move your special around, it can take quite a while if you focused on the wrong attribute, so try to keep that in mind.
---
Take advantage of a card the is always used by you.  If someone shares starched genes or any perk I use, the I take advantage of being able to pick snother card that I'd like to play.  I always run 3 inspiration and sometimes see a player share that, so swap out for suppressor or tenderizer.  If someone shared stranger in numbers, I add and share travel agent.  I can only share a 1 point card with 4 points in Charisma.
---
Thanks for the Info!
---
Ok gotchu that's great
---
Checking in!  Off to college in less than a month!
---
My auto rifle hits for 1800 to 2k lol (or 3k with prime receiver and mister sandman). Not sure what the problem is!
---
Could be molerats. They love eating my vending machines.
---
That's why they changed it.  
---
No one was buying atoms.    
---
Not that it means they're buying them now.. But there is more likelihood that they will.
---
Tried for days before reinstalling the game on the drive my OS is on. Not sure why that's so important but it worked for me.
---
I know u lie because I bit the bullet and spent $20 to finish today due to wanting to see how badly Papa Todd screws the people who finish early with the challenges. 
---
You get the chickens but they don't leave the coop and roam around a little like the Brahmin. :( still cool as heck though.
---
The .38 receiver is the worst it lowers your damage huge. I have a rifle with a .38 receiver on so I don't one shot legendarie in lower level events. It reduces damage by like 1k for me per hit. On paper it's over a 100 reduction or more.
---
I will follow that up with saying that the fireplace door is actually really cool and has an actual hidden door feel, unlike the vending machine which kinda shows the door frame behind it. 
---
A+ will be using it for trap doors and pathless doors with brick walls behind them.
---
Under each toe and foot.
---
Only good for the last moments when fighting the Queen.
---
Me too..but cut them to about 40%....if they are in my vending machine, I really do want to get rid of them.
---
Considering I'm mostly a Melee/Shotgun build, what's a good price I can get it for?
---
My main character only got like 3 HR, but my 2nd got 21 of them so I have them all to the my other.
---
Follow up to this post: 3 star legendary enemy: 1 Star hunters flamer lol
---
Invest into Rifleman x3 (perception), Expert Rifleman x 3 (perception), master Rifleman x 3 (perception), and tank killer x 3 (perception). In addition, you can get some perks to add damage in general such as bloody mess x 3 (luck) and tenderizer x 3 (charisma). The rest is up to you. You may decide to invest in stealth abilities so that you can get the sneak attack boost. You could also invest in defensive abilities (especially if you plan to avoid power armor). Otherwise, if you are going power armor, you might want to invest in perks that improve powerarmor.
---
I'm reading this trying to understand how it works.  rather than go to Google University for everything i want to learn in-game, but come here after the days burnout.  seems like the natural way to learn as a player, for me at least.
---
thanks to all who explain even a little piece of these in simple language !
---
add me Rogue.Aus i‚Äôd love to team and help you i‚Äôm on a lot, i can craft you weapons and armour
---
Are you a bloodied commando?  I was a non-bloodied stealth commando and the amount of ammo was frustrating.  Swapped to a bloodied rifleman and use way, way less ammo.
---
LOL, I don't know what if funnier.  The people coming here gloating when people get banned or the cry babies coming here when people get unbanned.
---
Either way who cares, Bethesda does not about this game.  In my opinion they realized it was WAY too much work investigating all the accounts that got banned.  It was thousands I believe.  So they started following whatever process they have in house last week to confirm account really should be perm banned, then realized it would take several months to go through the rest and just gave the rest of them a stern last warning.  It is BS because there are people who got perm banned that did not deserve to compared to those that duped their hearts out and were unbanned.  And there are still groups that have never received ANY communication other than they are temporarily suspended with their tickets then closed.  But what do you expect? This is Bethesda, their support is like 10x worse than they are.
---
Yes, this is currently bugged. When you first log into the game you will be able to see the typical workshop symbol. However, as soon as you server hop, quit to the menu then re join etc, you will no longer be able to see the symbol. The best way I have found to fix this is by fully quitting out of the game then starting again. There is an upside to this though, if were in a team you should then be able to rejoin the same server that you just left.
---
Worse thing is when 1 player starts it immediately and cant kill the ghouls so you have to try and solo the event... impossible
---
I have 18 luck with armor and usually pop a charred scorchbeast liver when scorched earth starts for 25 luck. Still get 1 stars
---
What‚Äôs your platform? (I‚Äôm PS4)
---
  I might have some in my stash.
---
I'm returning. What exactly is this Legendary Run I keep hearing about?
---
Actually, I'm not quite sure what to expect. I finished the original storyline (launching the nuke). Where do I pick up from?
---
Jukebox + whiskey + death tambo
---
A few pieces of trouble shooter's armor works wonders, depending on your build of course.
---
Had someone do that to me today. Too bad my challenge for selling to a player auto completed so I couldn't get the score for it. üò¨
---
those accounts probably have comments attached that they were banned and likely will get a permanent ban next time
---
Get your facts straight.  There are plenty of people still have not been un-banned.  You can find messages from these people on Twitter and facebook groups where Bethesda support is just closing their tickets.  So yes many were unbanned, there are still many that have not yet at least.
---
You guys just basically listed the only prefixes worth hanging on to or selling..(maybe some executioner weapons) .if it is anything other than that, i usually scrip it.
---
It is but showing the massive difference in damage numbers on paper and what they‚Äôre both actually doing to enemies shows that something is definitely off if a -.38 auto fixer with 70 dmg does the same exact thing as a -2shot fixer with 120 damage they both only do 39 no matter the cards mods ANYTHING
---
If only my OS had 70 free gigs, shame
---
it‚Äòs not all rugs/lights. it‚Äòs specifically the ones i like most. the confetti and mirror ball. try those, they‚Äòll sink.
---
It doesn‚Äôt allow me to play the game, unless it‚Äôs on my primary disk, C:, but I have no space on it
---
Ten thumbtacks inside of legos under each foot
---
The economy of this game was broken a loooong time ago unfortunately. If you don't like games that are broken in every sense... Then yeah fallout is not for you.
---
That doesn't sound so bad, a good open sign can do wonders. Some camps are just like a jumble with no direction. :P
---
Yeh I got one...still trying to figure out,  why?
---
Asking someone else, they also did some testing and it shows the exact same problem their ‚Äú2shot handmade does the same damage as a non legendary handmade no matter cards on or off‚Äù
---
Majority of the time I am Third Person because of the greater situational awareness it gives you.  I've done this since FO3.  However there are times where I will use First Person, usually in tight confined spaces, like indoor areas.
---
Also curiously enough I seem to be far more accurate with my shots in Third Person than I am in First.
---
If you use the right wall, you can't see the door frame of the nuka-door.  
---
Wood wall if I remember correctly. I just put the ugly side on the inside of the secret room, and put a wallpaper on the side with the nuka-door.
---
Guessing your not on ps4?
---
I am actually
---
I‚Äôm fucking dumb just saw the tag
---
They will never stop, they will never rest and neither will you.
---
AHHHH! Makes sense. I tend to only use the contemporary set and brick personally.
---
I lied? You asked if you got a chicken and you do.  
---
How is that lying?
---
Thank you this gives me more confidence to stick with it. I have been leveling in a public party with a friend mainly and have found it pretty neat.
---
Oh, it just said items so I assumed it meant all of them. My bad.
---
Nice. My psn is coldi3Lood if you want to add me.
---
The Ghille Armour skins especially annoy me as the one you get in Nuclear Winter I personally think is very well made but the armour skins look ridiculous and Im not sure if its a texture bug but it looks like theres confetti in it?
---
I say that jokingly and lighthearted so don't take it too personally but to clarify I also said "like the Brahmin," which isn't actually in any kind of enclosure.
---
&gt;And it can never be said enough, don't start the event if you didn't buy the recall card ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
OMFG !  that never occurred to me ... holy crap, that would suck donkey balls
---
I'd rather have the opposite, had 6 deaths in row during SBQ fight because I'd be forcibly respawned in the middle of the rad zone, in my bloodied gear.
---
Oh, I totally thought it was a part of the run because I got it during the season. Big dumb.
---
Got it I‚Äôll add you right now I‚Äôm the same as my reddit name
---
Love doing that. My second character was an unarmed build, so I decided that he was the vault's chaplain. He had a bad habit of sorting out issues in a physical manner.
---
His name was Father Fist.
---
Ooh, sorry I'm high, I said "like the fertilizer does with the Brahmin." Hope that clarifies! Again, totally joking friendo.
---
So you picked up a bloodied faster fire rate explosive handmade huh?
---
I actually wanted to play like I did before scire was introduced.  So like $6 a week for the season gets me that.  I couldn‚Äôt care less about the challenges.  $60 for freedom for 10-11 weeks of gaming is fine with me.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76
---
Gotcha. Just join :). I'll be off the headset, I'm not much of a talker. I may throw it on. Just PM me on ps or here if ya have a question. I'll do sane
---
Because its the letter m pronounced "em" . If it was meighty it would be a meighty
---
I love grafton, but it always seems to be busy. I‚Äôve noticed the level spikes at times as well but not just there. I plan on getting a month of fallout 1st, so will try to dive deeper into it soon.
---
Are the workshops usually worth it? My first couple ones were on the race track, and it seemed the monsters spawned outside of the workshop area and it was low level dogs.
---
I‚Äôll make sure to keep an eye out on that event, thank you
---
No, best thing to do is just block the troublesome people from the session, they won't be able to see you or your camp and can't interact with you or your camp! Had to do this for some people that were camping my base, killing me and my friend over and over
---
Raider bot..train station near silo Charlie..I believe has it.
---
Hey at least legacy's are no longer 350$ on ebay
---
I always share sun kissed because so many people have tons of rads lol
---
Well, two now. I am drunk and accidently drank one of the high radiation fluids when I misclicked
---
Radioactive pumpkin seeds look like bags of chips.
---
If the chickens leave the coop they get eaten by three headed possums.
---
Just a fyi, adrenaline is an amazing perk and definitely use it, but it is broken right now and doesn't work. It will be fixed in the next patch, but for now fill in some other perks to replace it.
---
I don't know man, I installed it on the D: drive
---
they just put on hazmat suits if you do that
---
Yeah, it's pretty much the only reason I would use the wood walls.
---
I got a 2 star bloodied explosive lever action for sale atm on xbox
---
I legit still don't know the layout! I can never find the right area after I get killed and just run around like crazy until I stumble upon it.
---
Probably not.
---
PC, but thanks :p
---
This is how I got it. Osmosis kit in my case.
---
Go to Davenport for "photo opportunity" take pictures of crater then down to foundation for 2 rep boosts
---
when are the instructions given ?  I'm low level and just trying to survive / figure the thing out, so reading what comes on the screen isn't a real option for me
---
Builds kinda scuffed right now. Going for a melee build
---
We aren't judging, they're pretty tasty
---
A metal d4
---
someday someone will invent a machine with audio and visual capabilities and provide tutorials (like a holographic simulation) to reach players what needs to be done.  wait ... what about using computers ?
---
ru listening' devs ?
---
I love it
---
Fuck man, my melee build one shots everything. And with ghouls I‚Äôm blind. I‚Äôm so sorry
---
I dont know why, but I do know It started after the Wastelanders update. It had the same effect on me..when I started noticing it after playing a few hours the day of the patch . Don't pay much attention to it, anymore.
---
I agree with your 2nd paragraph.  But the first one is silly. You seem dissatisfied.  So when others are they are wrong?
---
 Calm down psycho, releasing someone personal protected information can ruin someone's life.
---
Nobody deserves to be doxxed. He can play the game he wants too. That's why I didn't give out his username.
---
amen to that - where does one but cards ?  my lvl 1xx is Prema-stuck at max caps
---
In all truth besides the vendors being shut down we (fair players) don‚Äôt get affected that much. So I wouldn‚Äôt quit over it.  I would just stop giving them money.
---
Guess thats why.
---
TBH, Fallout 76 is just a Fallout 4 with less content and more expensive.
---
I imagine it more to be like:  
---
**Devs:** We've got this ghillie suit we're building for future stuff.  
---
.  
---
**Project management:** Do you think you could add that to armours as a skin.
---
**devs:** yeah, shouldn't take too long to do, we have all the assets, just need to match them up and make sure they...
---
**project management:** Excellent, we'll add them to tomorrow's legendary questline.
---
**project management:** Hey PR team, checked with the devs, they said it's ready
---
**PR team:** hi community, we've got some new stuff for you
---
**devs:** but, we didn't say th...
---
**PR &amp; PM team:** NOW, JUST GET IT DONE. NOW. A CHILD COULD DO IT. LOOK - CLICK, DRAG.   
---
**devs:** let go of my mouse. Let me out of this cellar goddamnit!  
---
.
---
**&lt;&lt;&lt;ffwd &gt;&gt;&gt;**  
---
**PR to community:** The devs are aware of the issue...
---
Same here. Sweetwater did it for me. Thanks!
---
Perk cards are good for building new characters.  Got an alt I'm building up with them.
---
You'll get it
---
What the hell does muling items and currency have to do with it?  I'm 78 and just got it by grinding xp. Make sure you hit the high xp events (Radiation Rumble, Guided Meditation, Line in the Sand), have high XP food (Cranberry Relish, Herbivore, Strange in Numbers), run high INT (Brainfungus Soup, Full Unyielding Armor, Building Group bonus). I know that sounds like a lot of things to keep in mind but once you are used to it it's pretty easy to maintain a decent rate just via normal play.
---
Idk, since Meg was a member of the Diehards it makes sense she takes a less violent approach than most raider groups like the Blood Eagles. Also after being ran out of Appalachia by the scorched the first time  seeing as they are still around she might be apprehensive of directly attacking Foundation and it's members since they might need to seek their help if the scorched start to take over again, since I think lore-wise the SBQ hasn't been killed and she continues to make SBs
---
If that was the Tyler county fair in the top left the Halloween themed building also has multiple bubblegum spawns FYI. Look inside some buckets or baskets or whatevers on the table.
---
You gotta prime it or you‚Äôll never be able to use it, that thing guzzles 2mm
---
Being able to fly/noclip during CAMP building would be pretty damn easy to do, as IIRC there were mods for FO4 that let you do it.  I think the deal is that from a programming standpoint, they‚Äôve connected the build mode with the character‚Äôs position in the world, rather than the cameras position, and they can‚Äôt easily decouple that.  Since your character has to physically be where you‚Äôre building, they can‚Äôt enable you to noclip because people will use it as an exploit.
---
I thought that said I like a way to lock my internment camp.......
---
If you are looking for a group where you can just kinda chill and do you own thing and team up for events and stuff feel free to add me. I'm on this sub solely to look for groups to pal around with.
---
Alright sent you the request won‚Äôt be on right now cuz of work but I‚Äôll be glad to help
---
my blood runs cold every time i accidently turn a corner and hear that sultry robot voice announce "meatbag detected"
---
Brrrrrr !  no AP refresh rate is enough at that moment.
---
i can only find "B" from the central room without problem.  I'll need to do it a few (dozen) more times before that changes.  so much to learn
---
Ok bro. Just join sometime üëç
---
Server hop sbq zones and find enemies within it
---
I mean I like running quests with other people too, but I'm pretty casual and I guess some people don't like that lol. I'm at work right now but I will try to remember to add you later on XBL.
---
probably still using it to make steel.
---
I feel ya - my least favorite part of the game.  Did it once, never again.  Good luck!
---
I know what you mean. Did the silo twice in a row, and twice in a row the fucking game crashed right before typing the code.
---
It's funny to me, we don't have to agree on that. :)  Yes I am dissatisfied, I had high hopes for Fo76,  and played for over a full year or more before throwing in the towel.. but between Bethesda and their terrible support I stopped supporting it.  I used to be a Fo1st member.  I still keep up on where things stand, there are no signs of either side getting better from my perspective. (Development or support)   Looks like it will only keep going downhill.  Wonder how soon free to play will be coming.  It's inevitable.
---
I don't care what lights are off but goddamit shut the door!! If Sofia sees daylight she's GONE.
---
Then Athena comes in ranting about dirt and the sky... Roaming traders insult my ability to hold CAPS in my living room... It all goes to shit so PLEASE SHUT MY DOOR.
---
I've been very happy with the full set (minus helmet), with the jetpack, buttress for everything, and cushioned legs.... waiting for them to add deep pockets for arms.  Worth the grind whatever that bullion total is.
---
Next update: 3 star sheep squatch has 1 Star assassins baseball bat
---
The walls, the fences, the prefabs.....
---
Since building camps is much of my 76 playing .... I need those things.
---
Get a flamer and kill them so fast they cant do it
---
How often do they spawn
---
Shooting gallery at Sons of Dane compound, or Golf Clubhouse. One if the villas up the side if the golf course (but you'll need percepti-bobble perk on to find it.
---
I'm on the fence about this for one reason. Moving overweight mules. You cannot fast travel them. But if they kill themselves and spawn on a friend (your main) they will fast travel while overweight. Instant respawn would prevent this.
---
I just don't think any of that fits the definition of "raider". Raiders are meant to be amoral survivalists. A raider would never concern themselves with the Scorched threat, their lives &amp; their kicks are all that matter to them.
---
The Crater raiders are simply Beth putting the kids gloves on so you don't have to be a real bad guy, which I think is pretty lame.
---
This is what happens when you drink too much Nuka Shine.
---
There are posters on the wall at train stations.  Just click on it and you are good to go.
---
I‚Äôvs never gotten it to proc. It‚Äôs always been Tipsy Taste Test.  Or at least I don‚Äôt think I did. But I have the recipes and that supposed to be the only way to get them.
---
Do you have the Personal Computer (not sure of the exact right name of it in game) at your camp? That‚Äôs how I triggered my Wasted on Tick Blood Tequila Quest.
---
"well you can buy atoms with real money instead...." - fallout 76 community
---
You can‚Äôt even equip them in NW to go over your armor so what‚Äôs the point 
---
(Although tbh that would be op)
---
I know what you mean. It's weird.
---
Any robot vendor. It's a recall card. Still needs to be further "crafted" at a tinkerer's work bench before you start the event though
---
It suspiciously tasted like Mountain Dew....
---
I regularly blow out all the items in my shops. Mainly because not many people make the trek to my camp, and I don't really care about all the caps anyway.
---
Sad but true, I miss it almost as much as using tormentor to cripple the SQBs wings.
---
Should have been the Scavengers in my opinion. The dead bodies and stuff in the Crater are just dumb for that faction. Blood Eagles are the real raiders here. 
---
Basically they should have made the Crater just a poorer and less skilled version of Foundation.
---
Very common mistake as it's not that clear to newcomers. Not the end of the world, but you will most likely get some angry emotes üòÇ
---
Why doesn‚Äôt this have more upvotes ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Bruh they could have made it a survival themed season with nukes as the end game
---
It is completely possible to re-spec your character if you‚Äôre not happy with some of your choices early on. After level 50 you stop getting new special points and get to choose whether you want to move an existing special point or pick a new perk. It takes longer, because you must spend a point to move a special stat where you want it and then another to pick the perk you need if you don‚Äôt already have it, but if you‚Äôre already level 30 it should still be more efficient than starting over unless you want to completely rework your character. I hope this helps out!
---
Agreed.  Thats why the whole idea of Crater "raiders" is dumb. They are just a gang of survivors the same as Foundation.
---
That's the wrong math pal.
---
Well you're right about that because I have four of those AP regents armor which help catch my breath fast. At least the ghouls are funny. They just swing their arms in the air like they just don't care just to keep with you.
---
It‚Äôs doable, but admittedly takes work until you‚Äôre used to it, but I believe in you, OP! Heck, two weeks from now, you‚Äôre going to be doing silos in half an hour!
---
Its worth it!!

[finally..](https://pa1.narvii.com/7039/64c7f626a34222cd3b4efd677b67dc7d063d0da0r1-245-250_00.gif)
---
Tbh, I just went and talked to Biv every day. He eventually gave me each of them but since I was mainly grinding for Rad Ant Lager, it felt like it was weeks at least before I got it. Overall, I'm thinking it's just random whether you get "the tipsy taste test" vs "waste on \[\]".
---
You know what? As a non FO1st member I‚Äôd be ok with them implementing the ‚Äúpremium battle pass‚Äù type thing as just FO1st rewards where non FO1st member a wouldn‚Äôt be able to use them until they got FO1st.
---
I would also hope that if they did that they would also add in a secondary reward of like caps or atoms or something for everyone or just make only a few FO1st exclusive board slots
---
I hope more people follows this etiquette once one wasteland drops, especially during uranium fever.
---
IIRC, I thought your flux is lost permanently if you die right after the event(as in deleted and not even dropped). As for the ultracite, it's not too bad because killing SB's are a breeze and you typically don't use as much in comparison to other materials.
---
No Ghillie Trapper either.
---
Raiders can get fucked I guess lol
---
Check raider outposts/ camps
---
They have got to be more consistent. Today was place a camp, but that is still nowhere near Kill 9 creatures like what
---
Definitely definitely definitely guilty of this, it was probably me, sorry not sorry.
---
What are you looking for?
---
So I asked a handful of high level players about this and they told me the nuts-and-bolts of it.  
---
They have a fully built and kitted camp blueprinted, with a custom waypoint where they place the C.A.M.P.
---
They have another blueprint (using the same saved materials) for a "forward base" that they put down AFTER the nuke radius is known.
---
The game craps legendaries into your inventory.  I have dozens of 3 stars waiting to be scrapped.
---
.45 and .556 are the most popular by far. A tier
---
2mm, 5mm, .308, and .50 are probably B tier.
---
Plasma carts, fusion cells, shotgun shells. C tier.
---
10mm, .44, and gamma cells. D tier.
---
I don't mess with missles, mini nukes, .38 , fusion cores, etc. They either never sell or weigh too damn much! F tier
---
I have 2 ranks of bandolier and a few ammo reduction armor pieces so I carry most of it on me. Usually I just put a few thousand of each in my vendor when I need caps. Works well.
---
I'll stop playing when they do this, because the only thing I find enjoyment in doing is farming low level legendaries and passing them out to lowbees.
---
Never mind found one after hours lol
---
Events are nice but you probably have more luck roaming the wasteland.some areas have a higher chance to spawn legendaries..today I probably had about 8 in a 2 hr session 3 of them were floaters.a bit strange westeck outside but go inside as well whitesprings and also roaming the area around watoga seems very good for me latley.
---
I actually used the computer last night and I got the Tipsy daily again. Thanks for the tip, I'll make sure to check it regularly
---
There are three that spawn at aaronholt, 3 at sons of Dane, 2 at the location directly east of west tek
---
Just take out fast traveling and add me some brahmin mountsüòÇ could sell sheepsquatch megasloth and more mounts. üòÇ (Maybe keep vault 76 as a fast travel point.)
---
Thanks, but I've already gone through the questline. This is for one of the two dailies Biv is supposed to give you. Admittedly the names are a little too similar
---
Dude try encryptid
---
I see, well I've only been at it for a couple of days so maybe I just need to keep at it more. Thanks!
---
I've seen it but as always it was locked. People that do stuff like that baffle me
---
Easiest to get to are probably the two close to West tek... couple high-level goals and a wendigo or bloated glowing one. The 2 tents on the left
---
Gauss shotgun for the daily grind
---
Gauss minigun for DPS 
---
Gauss pistol for fucking around
---
And areas reset after 10 minutes.  Your excuse is stupid.
---
Have you got it? I saw one today but it was locked so I couldn't interact with it
---
So enjoy the game til September
---
I just like to punch things...
---
Blair Mountain (in the middle south of the map with the huge excavator) is the site of the largest battle ever waged on American Soil outside of the Civil War. More than a million rounds fired between the Company and the striking miners. The excellent movie Matewan tells the story leading up to the beginning of the uprising.
---
I like the season just fine but the rewards the first 2/3rds of the season are just garbage imo. 
---
I would like half of the stuff to be bundles like the ghillie paint and Atomic PA paint. Just seems like a way to throw more crappy rewards.
---
Also the fireworks are cool but why couldn't it be the plan to make them instead of 10??
---
Just decisions like that annoy me.
---
Fixers are odd..that person that's heard about it but cant get the plan will take any fixer .my 1st one was berserkers and oddly it did me good till I found a quad then a bloodied
---
I gave a shit in the beginning, but when it became clear that Bethesda wasn't gonna do anything I stopped. They know their game has more holes than the plot of *Rise of Skywalker*, they know the engine is being suffocated by tech debt, they know the endless grinds they keep adding are anti-fun, and still Bethesda just does not care. 
---
If the people making the game don't care, there's not much point in me caring either.
---
Bwst spot to place a foundation here?
---
Yeah but you're playing the game wrong.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Oh sorry,  I didn't understand what you meant. Disregard my dumb advice. Lol
---
Nice.  Now scale it up so it will work in Wasteland Warfare.  :)
---
Oh hi Veronica
---
Why are you surprised by Beth's incompetence?
---
Besides SCORE and cosmetic rewards Nuclear Winter really isnt a *rewarding* gamenode for those that aren't enticed by PvP. Or at least, battle royale PvP
---
Sarcasm? Playing the game to relax and have fun is wrong?
---
Yea the only ghillie suit you can use you earn after about 16k xp and I get the feeling you can't wear armour when you're wearing it but don't quote me on that
---
2 star scorchbeast: 1 Star beserker snub nose
---
Sbq: 1 Star 2 shot 10 mm
---
Does it change bullets to fusion core?
---
Actually for the longest time I did run around in a sequin dress.
---
Great weapon!!
---
I use power armour and a TSE 50cal and I can run it just under 20 mins
---
U will get there practice makes perfect
---
That's Amazing. I love Veronica tbh.
---
I find them in the upstairs bath at the Giant Teapot, under the counter at Red Rocket there, the counter inside the main building at Dolly Sods where the Scout Leader is, or in the boat at Ohio River Adventures.
---
Money-printing machine still prints money.  
---
Won't be fixed until printing slows beyond acceptable limits. Even then, they'll weigh the pros and cons of dedicating time/money to fixing it, or just abandoning it and moving on to the next machine. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
But I still play it, because it fulfils a need for a certain type of game, and the millisecond something better comes up that can fill the same slot I'll be moving on and never looking back. I just hope the blatant missed opportunities of what this game *could have been* motivates someone to make something better.
---
Yup. It just generates some fertilizer. The chickens hang out in their coop.
---
Also just purchased it and can't find it in the build menu....
---
Look up the challenges most are easy and you can unlock some decent stuff like scrip,ammo exchanger some weapon skins for just doing things that most normally do
---
I server hopped and got two legendary super Mutants on the roof of Watoga Civic Center.
---
One of the gauntlets or a power fist. It'll happen eventually, I'm still accruing enough levels to move my SPECIAL over when I get bored of sniping.
---
No, at least no in my experience. Only affected by the shotgunner perks
---
My main disappointment with the legendary run is that the armor skins can't be used in NW...
---
You craft 180 50 cal at a time and the gun is a low rate of fire, I don't think it sells at all.
---
Depends where your camp is located i believe. If its in say, CBB itll be high level. Mine is on the edge of the forest, so hes only level 22. Had him about a week and a half with no trouble. 
---
I think they die less if your camp module is clear of all the structures.
---
Well... to be fair I don't believe she ever ate the folk she killed...
---
For legendaries, there's only a few I can suggest. Uranium fever is a tough one because there's always those players who seem to have the need to unload an entire magazine of explosive rounds the moment a legendary spawns(typically 3 per event though). If you can deal enough damage to the SBQ, scorched earth isn't too bad since 1-2 legendary SB's generally spawn along with other possible legendaries(no one waits though).
---
If you grind whitesprings golf club, there's a decent chance for a legendary ghoul to spawn there as well. 
---
Aside from events and the golf club, I can only think of guaranteed legendary spawns from quest missions and that's about it.
---
Yeah, im starting to notice this be a thing, especially in Uranium Fever.
---
Horde events, Leader of the pack, and when you just don't have the time do the fissure sites for legendary scorchbeasts. FYI there is a map of the fissure sites in the enclave military wing to the right of the four posters that explain how to launch a nuke. Just select each pin to add the location to your map.
---
That looks great!
---
I mean she seemed fine with it when I did it in NV, so at the very least she was complicit
---
search how to farm legendaries in utube. it is a veery easy challenge. dont lose ur mind and dont be lazy. i know some spots where they spawn with some high probability but u need change servers a lot untill u get them = 15-30 min to get all 3. There is a way to  find  100% a legendary 3\* and u need change server only 2 times.
---
As for me the challenge I probablly wont complete is about this stupid bobblehead. I literally spent 2 hours of running 12 bobblehead¬¥s spots, changing servers, restarting private server. It is not like i want to complain but I ve never been so "lucky".
---
Good luck! There's quite a few but don't get discouraged! I would suggest to not keep focused on it but just kinda have it on a daily to-do list kinda thing(as it is anyway haha).
---
I can find up to 3 sometimes at white springs in the golf club and along all the houses
---
I did too, apparently more stars just mean a better chance of getting that level of stars. So basically more rng  in a game where rng beat you when you are down while trying to get better legendaries
---
Well I don't know if they shoot it down with 6 bullets, but if your rifle is instigating you do double damage if an enemy is at full hp which would explain why you one shot robots from full hp but have a harder time with something which has a lot of hp and cannot be one shot.
---
If you have 15 agility allocated from SPECIAL points, then where do the other 17 points come from?
---
Ah that makes more sense. Thanks
---
I've sold tons of shotgun shells, although I think the ammo generator from bullion destroyed the market.
---
I find .45 doesn't sell all that often but when it does you tend to sell a lot.
---
I think the rewards are pretty boring to be honest. 5 or 6 ghillie armor sets and 5 or 6 atomic PA paints?? C'mon, most people are wearing cosmetics anyway, and you can earn a cosmetic ghillie suit. 150 scrip, 1000 caps, lunch boxes,  etc aren't very fun prizes.
---
Also I think the whole thing would feel more natural if it coincided with a content drop.  The Legendary Run is not content as some like to say, but it would be fun alongside real DLC.
---
Most likely bloodied or junkies builds that kill it with a handful of rounds
---
But, the sheepsquatch is a tough opponent. With high health, DR, and ER. If you're not hitting its weak point (head) you seem to do alot less than with most other enemy types. I'd suggest a better gauss rifle. As Insigating is only good for the first shot, maybe an Anti Armor gauss rifle? 
---
Do you have all the riflemen perks, and tank killer?
---
No it modifies the gauss so it uses ultracite 2mm, with ammosmith you can craft 108 rounds at a time. It‚Äôs a must have if you want to use it regularly.
---
Ya, thats why I classed them C tier. Either they sit or someone buys them all.
---
I find .45 goes well as Fixers and lever actions are pretty popular.
---
Two tips to make life easier if you don't know them: don't bother with fixing the reactor, just pick the lock and hack the terminal. Then also get an explosive gun of some sort to just blow the mainframe cores off the walls at a distance in bulk instead of actually plucking each one off.
---
there's a bug with legendary enemies where if you drop their health fast enough the won't heal. also they have no damage resistance for the first few seconds after spawning. this is why they can kill the queen in 5 seconds.
---
Pretty much anything will sell eventually if it's for 1 cap.  I've had the best luck with .45 and shotgun.
---
When I'm trying to burn caps I'll buy as much 2mm as I can get if it's for 1 cap, but I don't see it for sale that often, so I guess I have competition.
---
Ye shame it took them this long.
---
Oh, yeah I don't use those much so I hadn't checked them but you're right.
---
Keep at it mate. Eventually it becomes a formality like cooking food or collecting steel.
---
That kind of attitude is really unchill, and I think that dude just fundamentally doesn't understand the nature of fallout 76.
---
Fallout is a durdle video game.  There is no win condition.  The story content is lean, and the game itself is not particularly difficult. It's basically second life with healthy second amendment rights.
---
I've long since stopped trying to lecture people on how bad strong back is.  They just want a big number in the corner of the screen.  That's the beauty of it, you can do what you want how you want it.
---
Yea i have full tank killer and rifle man
---
I appreciate the effort you put into your post. In contrast I list all Bobbleheads for 100 caps and all Magazines for 75 caps. I sell out of them all the time. For a newbie the difference in caps will really add up. As for legendaries I read about the standard of 100c per star on this sub with the exception of highly sought after prefixes, ie bloodied, junkies and the like.
---
Ouch, never been that unlucky with it.  I've been fortunate I generally get enough from SBQs that I don't have to craft.
---
Looks like the easy shortcut got nerfed on PTS so there are going to be less nukes in the future.  At least Wendigo drops some flux.
---
3 star enemies should drop 3 star items guaranteed.  Totally agree.
---
Well they are not completely gone in a way. Since you can earn I think 2000 atoms if you complete the season. I'm sure it adds up to less atoms though, and that was kind of the point.
---
It just works
---
Technically you should be in power armour with emergency protocols for the stabilized perk. Otherwise you will want Blocker, Lone Wanderer, max Heavy Gunner, Nerd Rage and Bloody Mess.
---
This is so true, and no one ever bothers! I shut doors of my camp and every camp I visit. Checking my doors is how I know if someone came by haha. 
---
Similarly, I wish people would turn off the decontamination shower after using it. I keep it turned off via a switch pylon so that bloodied builds don‚Äôt get screwed if they‚Äôre not paying attention. It‚Äôs set pretty out of the way and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre generally pretty conscious of decontamination arches, but still. If you found it off, leave it off. 
---
This is why Mount Everest has trash all over the summit, no one leaves things the way they found them!
---
I‚Äôve never gotten Tipsy Taste Test.
---
The only stuff I struggle with is the "endgame" stuff like nuke silos, SBQ, Colossus, etc. Because I don't have stupid overpowered stuff, mostly.
---
Oh, and also Assaultrons and legendary max level glowing mirelurk kings. Fuck those. I'd rather fight a maxed out deathclaw any day.
---
Atoms.  Nothing in the run is worthwhile besides the atoms, lunch boxes and (once it's fixed) the ammo converter.
---
With atoms I might occasionally get a bundle with a few things I want rather than the bunch of stuff I don't from the run.
---
People that like lots of stuff in the run will probably think otherwise, but most people that talk about the run say they only want a couple items.
---
Was this on xbox? I went to a failed event. She just didn't land that much and like you, not a lot of damage was getting done. There were a bunch of people there, but 4 or 5 were on tents, a couple low levels were hiding inside the tens the whole time, and it drove me bonkers. I started sending out messages to try and get people off of tents, but I was rude about it so I think it made it worse.
---
Demo expert also adds damage to the gauss rifle
---
Beyond that, the only thing holding you back is the gauss rifle. It's never been, and still isnt that good of a weapon. Even though it should be. I'd recommend investing into a handmade or fixer. Or if you can respec a little, and want the gauss feeling: get the gauss shotgun
---
I've also noticed, when you scrap weapons/armour and learn the crafting that way the plans are still unknown when you go to the vendor also.
---
Yooo!!! I had this happen with my new account. I thought I was going crazy. 
---
PS4 as well
---
They planned to implement the changes in patch 21.
---
The same thing happened to me and I followed your lead and went to Alpine River Cabin and found one!  Thanks so much!
---
If only there was an event, that nobody ever seems to do, that spawns 3 guaranteed legendaries every hour or so. If only...
---
You don't even need to exchange any tokens if you're saving up. Just use the terminal at all.
---
This game is basically American Pickers to me in that I get the most fun out of going server to server looking for steals like this in ppls camps
---
What exactly constitutes a "Raider" in the Fallout series has never been entirely consistent. The Crater Raiders, the Capital Wasteland Raiders, the Commonwealth Raiders, and like, the three incarnations of the Khans are mostly only similar in that they're all gangs of assholes who prey on on settlers/citizens just trying to live their lives.
---
Magic weapons, probably. I have a magic minigun that drops a SS in about 2-3 seconds.
---
Leader of the pack event. 3 low leveled legendary wolfs. It is a very common event.
---
I got the plan for it months ago but I've never gotten a Fixer from the Purveyor, sucks big time. üòî
---
plan: dumpster
---
There are strong builds, and then there are stupid-OP just for large number builds.
---
People will defend Bloody builds to their death, but what they dont know is next patch (even now on the PTR) the free health regen (Glitch, not superpower) from Adrenal Reaction and Speed Demon gets patched -- and bloody isnt nearly as good as it was ince they die so fast.  A good stealth build with instigating is better than Bloody now on the ptr.  After patch, I am sure a surge of Junkies or Full health/Vampire builds will become champion.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you want some good builds, I would suggest looking up ANGRY TURTLE on youtube.
---
Me? I hate bloody builds and I love full health builds.  This is what I use:

---
They are only rarer because everyone is trying to find one today for the daily challenge.
---
Which fireplace is this? Is it the one in the most recent bundle?
---
I think it does actually, but for some reason explosive bait will still destroy your stuff.
---
And, in mid september, when we will have the legendary perk cards, there is an ammo crafting one too, and it stacks with ammosmith and superduper. Even in rank1, it gives a lot more ammo.
---
Ive been selling armor for 25 caps a star and weapons for 50 caps a star I just want them gone.
---
Thanks! I searched for eldyrus3, but came up with nothing. (Seems to be a  pattern for me today...)
---
 My ign is pue.o
---
 Yeah even with rad gear if I get sloppy around an assaultron dominator then I usually get rinsed too.  That's ok as long as you enjoy yourself
---
No thanks, we don't want more perk card packs. What we need is:
---
1. A totally different legendary perk system that is based on account-wide xp pool
---
2. Decouple the ability to scrap perk cards from upgrading legendary perks. No need in this absolutely unnecessary and tedious minigame with several even more glaring design flaws. We already invested quite enough time in getting 100s of levels. Legendary perk upgrades should never require any more work besides that.
---
I'm going to take a guess and say it's a bug with the atom shop and lists or something got hardcoded back when there were less items, and this isn't a bug with the cosmetic itself.
---
Everything I have before the Jack o' Lantern paint works, but it and everything after won't allow me to favor it for nuclear winter.
---
Wow someone downvoted me and said no reason why.
---
I bet you (whomever you are) are fun at parties.
---
I can't get them to spawn in a private server
---
Thank you sir.
---
What platform you on.
---
Glad you found it! Sucks they had to do such a heavy RNG reliant objective on double score weekend, especially as if there *was* a bobblehead somebody probably already took it
---
Aint magic, it is called bugged.
---
And to add to this list, One Gun Army in Luck. I‚Äôve found it good for staggers and crippling
---
Find a new game to play then lol
---
All my PW paint works and everything up to the armor paints.  The Jack o' Lantern paint and ghillie cosmetics don't though.
---
Violet flux. Ive been collecting for some time today. Jut returned from my last run, with 30 raw violet flux, but hadn't checked on the fluids. Oops...
---
No. But I‚Äôve been stockpiling a ton of most auto ammo (5.56 and .45) I have 35k 5.56 and 27k .45 (it helps explosives are worth a lot on the ammo converter)
---
How-
---
go to mire into the treehouses they have a few spawn locations
---
I do! Except when I fight those enemies xD I usually just put my stealth armor on and go around. Not worth the pain and ten wasted stims lmao
---
How good/useful is unstable isotope while in PA? Does it do much damage to you and do enemies take noticeable damage from the explosion?
---
This is the route i take when i need to restock my vending machines with a few bobbleheads.
---
[https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-bobblehead-locations/](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-bobblehead-locations/)
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right
---
Don't forget to wear light footed in perk
---
Ah. Ok
---
Happy cake day btw
---
I've gotten to where I just glitch though the silo, takes about 10 mins to launch one
---
It is indeed! I had to pull the trigger on it for a proper fireplace. The circular one with the tall (but not quite tall enough) chimney is great, and throws off nice warm light, but the electric fireplace fits so much better in so many more places.
---
or the treehouses in the mire
---
Or remove punji boards like what they did to welcome mats üòÇ
---
Love how everyone started defending their weapon completely missing the point.
---
Yes, Nocturnal, Assassins etc. are complete trash and shouldn't be in the game.  There is nothing "legendary" about a system where 99% of the time you regret getting the item and just queue it up to be turned into scrip.  This isn't a looter shooter.
---
Took down two SBQ today, three legendaries and a large handful of glowing (misc).  Busy times, but no fluids dropped.
---
U can just server hop
---
Have you tried rebuilding your ps4 database?
---
That looks awesome! 
---
I helped my sister to build a camp with similar design elements (all these wallpapred exterior walls and circular beam constructs). Turned out quite nice and modern. Would be great to take a closer look at yours! I'll add you, my ign's VvT.
---
I agree, the only one who should be considered a 'raider' is Ward. He is one sick blood-thirty psychopath.
---
Moot point, now. Just checked and the raw flux deteriorated. Thanks, though, for the kind offer!
---
Private servers have much lower spawn rates on Bobbleheads and magazines.
---
pure damage output? bloodied commando/heavies, and there's a stupid thing you may or may not know about, "magic" weapons, make the guns damage output glitchy and the game doesn't know what to register so your guns to ridiculous damage, you can look up what perks make a gun magic, pretty sure its only heavy guns. but personally I use a bloodied heavy build with a magic vampire's gauss minigun and I melt just about anything that comes in my path
---
It was a joke dense turd
---
I'm sorry that happened. I tried searched your name as well and it said 'We're unable to find a Bethesda Net user with the name pue.o"
---
I'm not sure what is going on. Maybe it is an issue on their end.
---
It was a fucking joke
---
Yeah that was my thought on the matter
---
Honestly it may not be bloodied level overpowered but an unarmed melee build is pretty overpowered. Instigating deathclaw gauntlet can one hit most things. Put enough points in endurance. Get some strong vanguard armor and its possible to tank some serious damage all day long.
---
This guy did it and I got my first legendary fixer
---
Exactly. That‚Äôs really the what matters.  
---
I played some at launch, and a few times here and there since. Eventually put it down and didn‚Äôt play until Wastelanders dropped. Now I‚Äôm loving it tbh.
---
HOW IS IT?
---
Congrats, what are you studying?  
---
Are you going to VTU?
---
It could be for the daily challenge to buy/sell items from players.
---
All of the rewards blow except for the camp items and unique PA skins.
---
That thing just defaults to off.
---
this is just so exaggerated, if this is really how the game  is running for you maybe it's your console? played on both consoles since launch and have never had anything remotely close to an experience like this. I can say it used to be awful and has improved but still was never this bad in my experience
---
I understand that M is pronounced "ehm" but being a consonant, wouldn't it be A. Or does that rule apply to the way you pronounce the word rather than spell the word?
---
I am guessing that people are beating you to it. One of the dailies for today is to kill 3 legendaries. Leader of the pack is an easy way of accomplishing that.
---
They're pretty bad to do honestly. You'd make more money by conning ignorant players into buying them for 100 caps each at your vendor.
---
Yes, it does. But the game economy is already totally f-up.
---
It applies to the pronunciation
---
What if its a person on the pylon at encryptid
---
People min maxed EXP builds to get to Rank 100, not all used exploits.
---
Radio towers seems to have the highest spawn rate for me.
---
Lol yeah
---
If you min maxed EXP builds and made this season your full time job, you‚Äôll definitely be max rank now.
---
* 15 base
---
* \+15 unyielding x5 at low health
---
* \+1 left arm
---
* \+3 road leather shielded
---
* \+4 bird bones
---
So at low health I should have Agility of 38, above I was not below health 20%, but I'm losing 1 point somewhere and can't find where. Health varies depending on diluted radaway use and rad state.
---
Yeah, I often end up with a bunch of missiles from mole miners weighing me down too.
---
Horde events in general spawn below level 30, and have a guarentee legendary as well.
---
Any place with alot of enemy will increase chances of finding a legendary.
---
Drink a nukashine will also increase your chances of finding legendaries.
---
I have no clue about magic weapons . That's very confusing now
---
Shoot the legs
---
effects like junkies, 33 vats hit chance, bashing damage, on weapons like the LMG or minigun, the damage is greatly exaggerated, look up angry turtle magic weapons on youtube if you still need more info
---
Same. I spent almost an hour searching known spawn points.
---
On a plus side I have a bunch of junk replenished and two new magazines but the bobble heads weren't spawning for me eith!!!
---
Add me: bludybowlingpin, careful at my camp if you visit, though.
---
Looks very modernesque
---
Does drinking a nukashine actually increase the chances of finding a legendary? Or do you just simply FEEL legendary when you drink it?
---
No more free stuff. Boooo

I got 2 piece of 1 star furious shovel from sb in row one day. And onother day again one more shovel. And this legendary wood armor is great, i love when game gave it to me, i just love it ‚òπÔ∏è
---
JUNK WALLS
---
Then indicate as such with a /s at the end of your comment so people can tell. Humor and sarcasm do not translate well via text all the time.
---
Aye aye . I think I get it now .
---
"Server connection lost"
---
They are a source for PA plans even if the drop chance isn't that good. I tend to buy them for 50 caps, not more personally.
---
Wait. WHAT?  Free health regen? Nerfing Bloodied? WTF is going on in PTS land?
---
The biggest lie in the school playground.
---
Thank you, it did!
---
Lol.   I know it's crazy.
---
I just leave it off
---
Yes because consuming alcohol makes you an alcoholic of course.
---
on xbox people don‚Äôt come in public teams
---
"magic" is a glitched mechanism. Some combination in weapons (mostly fast firing heavies or shotguns) or sometimes armour can give you this. In any other game this would have seen as an exploit due to abnormal damage because of a bug.
---
I would not create a full build depending on it. Because it might be fixed (even unannounced).
---
You two make a beautiful couple. So what are you going to name the babies?
---
What does that have to do with drops?
---
Can I get a tutorial? My GF and I would like to copy that.
---
i have, searched all over google before i came here..
---
Not even sure why you're being downvoted lmao
---
Yeah I hate it too, but it's the only thing I've found
---
Shenanigans!
---
i know where to ‚Äùget‚Äù them, problem is they arent there.. there is nothing from the raider set available for crafting or in the atomic shop what so ever.
---
Sadly you're right, probably.
---
Like to do my part! :) Although had someone just watch me die during an event..... sucks for them i always ditch my loot before hand üòåüòÇ
---
I tried it on my base PS4 and then the PS4 slim. Both with an Ethernet connected.
---
Some mutation can glitch (magic??) and gives you health back (like a diluted stimpack).
---
I do not know anything about these nerfs. I have to check PTR then.
---
Really? Interesting. You get recipes that are more cocktail-oriented. Last night I got the recipe for Tick Blood Tequila Margarita. What's funny is that your tequila is one of the ingredients, so I can't even make it
---
Edit: Well I'll be darned, I just got Wasted on Tick Blood Tequila. Cheers!
---
Broken since its release, I gave up reporting this bug.
---
That and the dropped plans are all just junk now, I used to be able to sell the Prime plans for like 6,000 caps sometimes, but now I just drop them in my 'free bin' at my camp, same with every other plan that drops.
---
I have 195 inproved repair kits too lol and loads of flux to make my mutant serums. I'm pretty much just playing SBQ for the XP and just because it's fun.
---
But yes, 3 star please. Sometimes she's easy as shit since there's people on there who can ice her in 3 minutes, but sometimes she's  a healthy struggle.
---
You're definitely not crazy.  Purchased the plans for a  Safe yesterday.  Built one in my camp.  Today, the safe is still there, but my character had to repurchase and relearn the plan, as he's suddenly an amnesiac.
---
Yup, we‚Äôve sure not had any raider content. Not ever.
---
We had a good group. Took only one guy to ruin everything too.
---
drops - no money for bethesda
---
atoms - money for bethesda
---
what don't you get?
---
Get mutations, some are great regardless of build or play style. Organize your stash, going to be storing plenty of max level legendaries. Grind ammo; specifically materials for ammo- lead, steel, gunpowder. (Not too much)
---
Same
---
I got it on once.  But have since moved camp. I‚Äôll try again haha
---
Hey. It just works.
---
Likely being saved for Steel Dawn and Fractured Steel.
---
Just wait until you're spending 50-100+ scrip for legendary modules to craft 1* nocturnal secret service pieces/gauss weapons...those should be 3* guaranteed
---
Or: drop another item somewhere else and all of it will move to the last dropped item's location.
---
team loves it when I rev them, mainly because I share Revenant to everyone. 50% damage bonus? RISE, BROTHERS AND SISTERS!
---
Yeah I'm sure the bug is all one big /r/conspiracy wonder what their take is on it?
---
Don‚Äôt work for me :/
---
Yup..props to whoever revied me at the SBQ this morning, Bloodied build balancing on the wire, got shot up the ass by scorched..'noob move I know'..had spawned in after lead farming with around 400 lead on me and no scrap pack...I know that would of been snatched up
---
grenades work
---
Nuclear Winter, no. PvP, yes. Full set of sentinel assassin armor is the preferred set.
---
Fat chance when they can make money off it.
---
im like level 140 if you still want help. dont have many good weapons though
---
delete your bugged ones
---
I'm pretty set on scrap, I really need to know the best way to get ahold of maybe flux for tier 5 weapons mods and a more viable source for screws, gears and acid?
---
Go into the atom shop, deselect the skin so that it reverts to the default, your camp will work again. I was salty too
---
We have to keep in mind that most of these 'Raiders' have been alive since before the bombs dropped. They wont just go full out tourture and mayhem at the drop of a nuke. Sure some MIGHT, but they would be outliers. 
---
Nuka raiders have had 200 years to evolve into what they are.
---
Definitely. Coldi3Lood if you want to add me? But I'm about to hop off...its almost 230am here. Cool?
---
There's an exploit going around right now that lets people blueprint and build items like the ammo machine or fusion core generators at their camps or workshops
---
is that a legacy item?
---
it‚Äôs a bitch to achieve i‚Äôm stuck on that on pc
---
That emote can backfire though if you try to use it for anything else.
---
I was ta the queen last night and every single fucking person was standing on top of something and she would not land for a solid ten minutes.  I didn't have my mic set up so I was off to the side emoting for everyone to come over and they all assumed I was calling out a legendary and would run over, scan around and then angrily shoot me in the face before retreating to their perches.
---
Sometimes "follow me" literally means "follow me".
---
Wow thats just nuts I jacked all their 45 and dipped, blows my mind how people figure this stuff out meanwhile I‚Äôm over here just bonking shit in the head
---
Check the latest ATX datamine from the PTS, several junk fences coming up eventually.
---
I mean they do talk about raiding Foundation, so I mean that's kind of raiding...I guess?
---
I was walking around Foundation and I was thinking how cool it would be to have an even where the Raiders storm it and then a vise versa one for Raiders where Foundation attacks and it rewards reputation.
---
Get a mule, Can help free up a lot of space
---
You can just buy atoms to finish it if you want to. It's 150 USD or so (maybe less with bonuses) to buy enough atoms to go from 0 - 100. Of course no one goes 0 - 100 and some people would have enough atoms just saved up as well. If you played until the double exp weekend, maybe put in an extra 10 bucks and used some saved atoms you could be at 100 easy by now. Obviously the best way to do it though is to wait until near the end and then only use atoms at that point but some people are impatient. I actually used some atoms I had saved up and used some to skip 6 ranks. It wasn't optimal but I wanted to look at the chickens haha.
---
Just doesn't seem like it has anything to do with the topic. Since the store is cosmetic stuff and drops are the actual gear.
---
A-10
---
Congrats mate.  
---
Just be warn, do not apply any skins to your axe. I managed to destroy 2 grognak axes by reskinning them to Stanley. I do not know if they have fixed it yet. So be careful.  
---
\*\* Cries in Bloodied + power attack + 90% weight grognak axe \*\*
---
Nice! That‚Äôs the gun I‚Äôm searching for in the sea of rolling pins and bone clubs. Enjoy it!!
---
It would be hilarious to make something like Storage wars, but from post-war Appalachia :D
---
Bruh, why you gotta make me hate my camp after I just re-did it?! Seems like building on water is the key to getting good flat land though.
---
You talking about underground base as in you play a instrument that's kinda hidden and you glitch under the map?instrument or workstation
---
Check the groves as well, leave for 10-15 minutes and go back I find plenty
---
Took me fucking hours! Have them drop a 'nade on themselves or come in with low health. Site alpha is a great spot for it
---
that brahmin outfit though, MOOOO!!!
---
I had a group of level 100+ do this during the Uranium Fever event...I was on my level 40 (made a new character JUST for the battle pass). idk if they did this for me or for everyone but they were awesome.
---
NW has no legendaries so no not even
---
Glad I'm not the only one who wants to see a Shield in the game.  Also some Perk Cards for using Shields with 1-Handed weapons.
---
I got it to work by deleting the platform under the missing turrets.
---
Yes, and he had the greenhouse dome from the green thumb pack with the instrument stick out of the dome floor
---
Just how much Nukashine did your character drink???
---
If you could bulk ammo or make ammo packs it would be easier to sell some of it IMO. It seems like most ammo types are not valued at 1 cap per bullet.
---
Just more melee stuff in general would be appreciated.
---
New camp item?
---
Looks like a 360 shove or double tre to me.
---
For a lot of people that‚Äôs it.
---
I‚Äôm 162 and still finding fun stuff though.
---
Nuka World was the first time raiders actively raided settlements in the Fallout series.
---
Indeed.  I'd make use of my Vampire's Deathclaw Gauntlet even more, considering it's got that 40% faster swing speed.
---
Yeah thats fair enough i guess i wish the like raid ish thing we had was more popular
---
i could be crazy but i thought no legendaries had more than 1 star in fo4
---
I'll pay for it lol
---
Sheepsquatch is a bullet sponge.i carry around a mutants faster fire reduced weight mini gun just for spongy enemies.there is a bug in the game if you can fire 200 plus rounds a min or certain legendary effects it will drain the health on just about anything. Nothing special about that minigun I have it's just ffr that makes the difference
---
Yeah tends to be what happens. Then I just stopped caring as I have enough shit in my stash anyways so if I miss a few it's meh.
---
Not magic.... called bugged.
---
Not even on topic here but I nuked Whitespring as my first nuke and I like saw no enemies and felt like I ran around for an hour or more, what gives?
---
Ok now that I never seen.was it the cement base or just the dome with dirt underground. I could probably do it without the cement base.
---
I see everytime someone says something bad about bloodied the downvotes come in...  
---
Kinda sad.
---
The way I was able to help someone with it is to use an explosive weapon. I stood in shallow water and shot my feet which eventually killed me (after removing my armor). It HAS to be shallow water though. If you do this in deep water, you character will only have the option to repawn and no one can revive you.
---
It was a joke, this is a video game.
---
I wonder how the new level scaling is going to work with events?
---
If this is something you really want to get done. I am online on PC right now. My ID is Eldyrus3
---
Oh i will definitely try that! Thank you! The were in the roof. Is that the same? Sorry the dumb questions, i started playing recently
---
Site Alpha...get the glowing Yao guai close to death, have you‚Äôre guinea pig hop in and cuddle with him. Just make sure you can finish off the Yao guai.
---
I oneshot it with my bloodied gauss shotgun.
---
Im not sure, all I know is that the bass was sticking out of the domes floor
---
usually in a public team when I see that I can't tell if they are doing it for me or some random person, so i never end up going...maybe I should go more now?
---
Why not?
---
That door is all kinds of messed up
---
It's unfortunately not too difficult, the game engine is just a slightly modified version of the one fallout 4 had. Anybody with some modding experience of past fallout games would have a decent idea of where to look for vulnerabilities. And between new issues constantly coming up and the game being updated once every 5 or so weeks, there's plenty of time to abuse whatever comes up. Doesn't help that anti-cheat and flagging seem to be nonexistent, there's no instant flag or ban for somebody who just happens to have 60 of the same bloodied explosive laser on them. Until mid-late last year, you were able to openly modify some of the game info by just opening cheat engine. That's it, no hiding it, no cracking variables, just easy access with a basic tool
---
Nope, just shotgunner
---
We can turn literal scrap into reactors with machined edges that produce enough power for an entire town, but we can't fix a light on a helmet...
---
May as well jack the weight back up on bobby pins because that don't make any sense.
---
Personally find fighting the queen inside the blast zone, near fissure prime, an overall better experience. I am that guy when people are sitting on fences or roof that charges in to aggro her, forcing them to come join the party.
---
I just walk everywhere and never fast travel.  You really experience so much more of the game and random encounters.
---
Hate to break it to you man, but I think the Plushie is inappropriately touching your girlfriend...
---
i keep a non-legendary low level combat rifle on my hotwheel for this exact reason, quick weapon swap feels safer than bashing sometimes
---
Aah okay. :)
---
All the same man and congrats!
---
Congrats!! Always a great feeling soloing something!  The silo‚Äôs are all identical so you don‚Äôt have to learn 3 layouts.
---
I want a Victorian style painting of Todd and his eyes follow you as you move.
---
Wat
---
Quack Doc
---
Congrats!!! The first solo Nuke Launch is always a great feeling.
---
Free fallout first sub for a year. The plans to dupe every item in game and Todd‚Äôs used buttplug
---
no but getting fucked off your face just sitting in your appartment or whatever is a good start
---
Stopped really hanging out with the group i've been playing with since launch for this reason.
---
We used to all run different builds, share ammo and resources each other used, and play the game more for fun than the all-mighty grind. 
---
Then the "legendary run" started Now all of 5-6 them run high INT Bloodied Unyeilding Fixer VATS stealth builds, complain about how they are always out of ammo and only play on FO1st private servers because randoms "get in the way" during events and they can't get as much XP as possible.
---
Games stop being fun when you stop playing the game and start playing the meta.
---
This is where I'm at now, using most of my scrap/ammo on my first nuke/SBQ run. 
---
What I love the most about Fallout is exploring and scavenging for everything I can find. I am excited to go back and restock everything, try new areas, but I do need a little break haha
---
Skater XL and Session are WAY better
---
Heavy weapon
---
I think
---
That nuke photo is an awesome shot!! And how is Rosie these days?
---
If modding happens, I hope it includes the Legendary Modification mod from Fallout 4.  Might have to make any equipment modified with Legendary bonuses untradeable like the Bullion equipment.
---
Thanks! Good to know. Now to explore new areas to restock all the scrap/ammo I used üòÖ
---
I didn‚Äôt cheat. My friends did, sure, but that‚Äôs on them and they‚Äôre still good people no matter what garbage human beings like yourself say. As for items, I traded for what I have. I‚Äôve been around Fallout 76 for quite some time. Your assumptions not only make your argument look foolish, but they make you look like an incompetent douche. You‚Äôre just an arrogant little child who wants to be insolent to get the final word. You are not only toxic, but you are obviously so very spoiled. You are ‚Äúmightier‚Äù than us? What? You sound like the nerd that uses video games as his vindication. You think your actions in a game make you a person? They make you something? Maybe you need real life friends.
---
As well, just because you personally view your self worth through video games doesn‚Äôt mean someone else playing it how they want to bothers you. You need to grow up and get a life, kid.
---
Edit: Enjoy your downvotes, by the way. You can cry and say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all the dupers,‚Äù but it‚Äôs people who have a shred of self decency to know that you‚Äôre a sorry excuse for a person.
---
You‚Äôre a toxic gamer and people like you are what‚Äôs wrong with the community. Not your views on duping, but your egotistical arrogant ‚Äòlittle-man‚Äô attitude. If you think this game is an MMO, you must not play MMOs. This is Fallout and plays like Fallout. Bethesda just made an online FO4 to cash in on multiplayer gaming. Fallout was never meant to be an MMO. If this or FO4 were you first Fallouts, then you‚Äôre a casual gamer who has no comprehension of what game he‚Äôs playing.
---
**ALSO, I JUST SAW THAT YOU HAVE SOLD GUNS THAT HAVE BEEN DUPED.** How the hell do you feel that you‚Äôre mighty and that you have any achievement when all the shit you trade with is mass duped? It was duped way before this dupe wave. You just thought you had the only copies of the legacies you were trading? The plans? Did you earn them all yourself? Only you should benefit from dupes, yea? You want dupers banned, but you also want to get your hands on all their stuff to trade.
---
Hypocritical joke. ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Are alt character's not countable towards RANK score? I'm pretty sure they are. And I imagine if people planned right they probably literally grinded with friends on low level alts with decent guns, and grinded like 20-100+ levels easily during the double exp weekend, excluding Lunchbox boosts, Event/Building Group boosts, Lover's Embrace, Inspirational, can stack up to some pretty high boosts if done intensively.
---
I'm Rank 57 halfway through to Rank 58 by the way, and I generally play alone, but that double EXP weekend stacked with all the other boosts I could get was some pretty insane gain on the repeatable.
---
whats this dude talking about
---
Believe it or not it counts as rifleman. If you have it as a pistol its gunslinger.
---
The plasma flamer is a Riflemen? Weird.
---
Your view of raiders is WAY too simple.
---
That raider lifestyle is not really sustainable for long term survival or development, what's truly unrealistic is that many of the other raider factions in other games last as long as they do before being wiped out or dying out all on  their own.
---
Most of those raider factions would have suffered from frequent loss of human resources due to casualties during their super violent take no prisoners raids or would have been left all but helpless over periods where they were unable to pillage and obtain resources.
---
The kind of raiders that survive long term are the ones you see at Crater.  They know that they can use deadly force to take whatever they want but they also know that actually using that force needs to be a last resort.  If you go into a settlement, murder all the residents and loot everything there is to take then sure you're set for the short term but for the long term you're now out a source of resources you could have slowly squeezed into handing over whatever you need whenever you needed it.
---
To sustain the kind of raider lifestyle you see in other games you would more likely need to have a nomadic society constantly on the move to find the next settlement to wipe out and loot, and while we've had plenty of nomadic cultures they didn't survive on war and looting alone and still utilized agriculture and animal husbandry.
---
i‚Äôm not home currently, and i‚Äôm sure eventually i‚Äôll get it done
---
The Flamer is Heavy, buy not the flamer attachment on the plasma, its rifleman/gunslinger.
---
Yes and yes.
---
Maybe because its one constant shot and not a series of rapid shots?
---
At every single event I always get like my bare minimum damage in just so it counts for me and then I wait for everyone else. This is my favorite community in the world just because I don't have any other experience where I'm in the rusty pick and me and some other dude are showing our legendary guns to each other. Everyone else who loves this community please for the love of God stop one shotting legendaries!
---
I'm glad I'm not the only person who looks at all the neon letters at a camp and thinks "How can I Captain Underpants this?"
---
I love finding people who use all of their letter budget.
---
Neither of this two mutations gave health regen. Healing factor did, out of combat.
---
Walk around cranberry bog and find those BOS outpost with that huge red rocket launchers with it, lure some scorchbeasts to it and have fun :)
---
I have Electrically Charged, which is basically the same thing. It's slap damage on most things, but it does fry nuisance enemies. Radroaches, molerats, and Mirelurk spawn just kinda sizzle and pop when they smack me. Anything bigger than that doesn't take any damage worth mentioning, but it will stagger/stun them for a moment so it helps when you're overrun with ghouls
---
The stats on the secret service armor rival true power armor. Especially with buttressed mod. And you have a jet pack that uses ap not cores? Why anyone would want power armor is beyond me. Might be a little tankier meaning you can probably take on more DMG but not worth it at all in my book.
---
&gt;The damage the player takes is reduced by a flat 7% per piece on the frame, while the radiation damage reduced by 15% per piece, so a full set reduces damage by 42% and incoming radiation by 90%. 
---
The Dr/Er is then applied to the reduced damage.
---
From the Wiki.
---
Post doesn‚Äôt really make sense...Speed demon affects movement speed and reloading speed not health regen...I‚Äôm not bloodied so I guess it doesn‚Äôt really affect me, just interested in the post
---
there‚Äôs that achievement of taking photos all around it sucks but easy
---
One thing I want to add to this post is that the XB1 mule was completed without having to trade for or buy a single plan from other players.  I think the post text covers most of the people who donated plans, but to those that helped on Free Range or whatever else THANK YOU!, couldn't have done it without you.  A true community effort.
---
im still collecting the codes and im looking forward to being able to get into a silo and going trough it, just one question, is the bomb drop location completely random?
---
Rare?  It took me a minute of googling and then fast traveling to two locations to find mine.
---
Ad Victoriam, brother.
---
Oo. I got the same roll just for a power fist.
---
I know I am so pissed I didn't know either there so much to this game. I hate my life I missed out hard. And I am not willing to lose my 170 levels to start a new character.
---
You've replied to a dead thread from 10 days ago but I'll reply anyway. Imagine paying for destiny then paying for their season pass. Imagine paying for Siege then paying for their season pass. Imagine paying for Rocket League then paying for their season pass. I could go on.
---
Every reward in 76 has been free. Some people feel so fucking entitled about this game. How boring would it be if you were just gifted everything? Would you expect to get any rewards from any other game with any other battle pass system without putting the work in to get them? It's so easy to do 76's challenges compared to other games aswell. Get off your high horse.
---
Yeah as long as it's something you built it should work. You should see the "shadow" of the turret on it and when you scrap that part it also deletes the turret so you can build new one.
---
That‚Äôs weird that the game counts it as riflemen. Thought for sure It‚Äôd be commando.
---
No, you control where the nuke goes
---
Awesome! Thank you!!
---
No you choose where it drops, there are some no nuke zones though.
---
I mean, they're literally free items.
---
You're complaining about getting a ton of stuff for free.
---
‚ÄúI knew it was a scam to begin with‚Äù - Not to be a dick but ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt so smart‚Äù also seems to apply to you to homie.
---
People just gonna exploit this, like having 30 items for 30k caps each, instead of normal trading. It hard enough to find a good vendors, gonna be even worse
---
That's awesome. It just says "decreases fall damage" but not by how much. I took a big spill the other day and had no problem.
---
Oh yes because everyone has the time in the day to play a *video game*, you may not want to spend time with your family, girlfriend, wife, etc but those with an actual life might want to :D. Stop being such a shill for Bethesda.
---
Who hurt you? u/OP
---
Your weekly‚Äôs SCORE is the standard 1k SCORE. Only the daily SCORE is doubled. And i think the icons for workshops is unknown.
---
I'd buy .50 by the truckload if I could although I might be in the minority here as I get a really uncomfortable feeling the moment my reserves drop below 10k. :)
---
They talk about running protection rackets. So they‚Äôre more like mobsters than raiders.
---
Oh well.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true, and if Bethesda actually listened to the community we‚Äôd have like unlimited stash storage.
---
To everyone doing the "i'm dying" emoji during queen boss fight: i hope you get diarreah
---
The daily score was 1000 earlier and now it is 500.
---
5k easy. If your on PS4 let‚Äôs maybe strike a deal
---
It works the same for literally any game with a battle pass system that has ever existed in the history of gaming, but it's ok, you carry on thinking it's just a problem with Bethesda and that everyone that plays it is a shill. Go away.
---
Build floating base with one block on the ground. 
---
Believe me, wish to change place of your camp will come to you many many times in the futureüòÄ‚úåüèª
---
Unfortunately that's how it is. Legendary perks are just the final nail in the coffin for PA with it not being included in the poison and fire resist perks.
---
How did he scam you?
---
Kill his ass
---
They changed that last PTR patch. Now they are working in PA too.
---
You won‚Äôt lose any rep, you can max both. And if you want the mini go raider. Its a little more and just neighborly to ally takes a few weeks
---
No you can go either way depending on your goals. Google and search this subreddit more to make a decision.
---
Really? Sweet! PA is getting a slight (emphasis on slight) buff then.
---
Took the weapon then dipped. I was in a chat with him and he kicked and blocked me. I was trying to figure out why he needed something so badly.
---
And I hope there will be other nice things wgen the BoS arrives ;) Winter season that is.
---
Holy damn that's pretty wild tho! Have you tried to see if any of y'all gave the same stuff on you computers? Maybe some hardware, or software?
---
Could be that there's a problem there. I mean, i had a problem with a game lagging like crazy, but that was because the game was optimized for geforce. My pc was even stronger than needed.
---
Not saying bethesda ain't at fault, because not having optimized was literally the other companys fault, so this would be bethesdas fault as well. Just trying to narrow down the possibilities.
---
PS. Don't get why people downvoted my comment tho. I literally said i could be wrong, so i was not saying that he was his fault.  It ey, downvoting stuff for no reason is what people do on reddit.
---
alrighty thank for the info
---
Same. I feel like that will be the last hope for a proper PA buff if Bethesda is planning one.
---
Ah right, sorry man. I wish they sorted out the trade, so you could both trade items instead of caps.  Maybe when you select the item you wanna trade you both just press accept or decline. Even my daughter has this option on her games on Roblox üòÇ
---
Just don‚Äôt give it to him when he doesn‚Äôt have the weapon then leave
---
I like to use Mysterious Savior. I just find it amusing that someone on the team might not realize it is being shared then end up dying and having the mysterious stranger save them.
---
Hes probably hoping someone will mistake it for a rare apparel.
---
The CSS is the same one you can buy for bullion, they made it available for bullion in case you joined the raiders mid settler quest. The raiders do not have an equivalent quest reward. It honestly doesn't matter which one you join because you can max rep with both, I found it easier to max raider rep over settler .
---
Your rep will only decrease if you take the bullion for yourself after the raid and it decreases for the faction you picked. It's not much of a loss though.
---
The only daily that should be 1000 is the level up, the rest should be 500 since normally the dailies are 250 and the level is 500
---
its not that big of a change. i know, i tested it. most people wont even notice.
---
its just a bugfix
---
Yes, there's lots of things that effect loot tables, servers and character both included.. though they've changed a bit over time. FED76 have done a decent write up on it IIRC
---
Bottom floor of white springs gold club, hallway at the back. One spawns in the shelf. Took me a few go‚Äôs but got one.
---
I'm trying man. I'm trying. He's only showing as level 35 to me and I'm at 70 and have a pretty good opening sneak shot.
---
&gt; Go away.
---
Nah, I rather them fix their game first. Or wait until FO5 and then this game will be dead LOL
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Right? The trade function is in so many games. I didn't ever care for weapon honestly and wanted it gone.
---
No problem
---
Oh, I can keep the bullion? Perhaps I should go with the Settlers, keep the bullion (I alreay have higher rep with them) and then work on my Raider quests.
---
From what I understand, it's easier to build up faction rep than get bullion.
---

---
conduits can stop the " intersects with another object" problem. YouTube some videos on it
---
Anytime!  And if you want to skip the code searching and deciphering, check out nukacrypt, they post all the codes every week.  (They reset each Tuesday)
---
Could you link one?
---
Wow that's a decent amount of damage reduction, why on earth isn't that mentioned on the armor?! 
---
It always boggles my mind when developers leave such critical bits of information out of their games!
---
So it's basically a must have for Nuke Zones and tanking?
---
I got into PvP. I still do queen runs and other events with friends but if you can find some good people to PvP with it can be a nice challenge. Fighting without legacies and teslas is pretty fun.
---
I bought the nuka girl costume and they're gonna release one that is better üò≠
---
I want that cow outfit xD
---
semantics
---
Codes are always here https://nukacrypt.com
---
Don‚Äôt waste your time
---
thanks mate i‚Äôll check it out
---
Been near a year since I looked it up so not really. just google conduit building glitch or something like that and the YouTube rabbit hole should lead you to what you need
---
I'm aware of this. I was gonna be willing to help him out since he seemed newish to the game. I don't like seeing people trying to cheat people and was hoping I can change someone's view but here I am ü§£
---
I recently walked in on him with a random corpse in his trailer. Poor woman never stood a chance.
---
You get the stealth suit plan for free once you have completed the ‚Äòinvisible ties‚Äô quest for the settlers, once you have completed this the settlers are ready to raid the vault, personally I would stop and do all crater quests,  The crater endgame items I think are personally better Ammo machine and a Gauss minigun, However raider reputation is easy to earn as there is a raider reputation Glitch if you want the rewards quicker.
---
most accounts were suspended pending investigation, not banned. people who acted like there was a huge "banwave" didnt have their facts straight (as usual)
---
anyone surprised by this is clearly new, the exact same thing happened in 2019, only difference was the "unban" took longer.
---
&gt; I'm surprised that hasn't been patched out, usually they are very quick to fix any exploits that benefit people.
---
I dunno about that. The Rocksy "Appalachia has a new corpse" infinite-rep exploit is still not patched either.
---
Thanks !!! üòéüëç
---
Swap you a bloodied walking cane?
---
Can you store that wall or foundation? Storing it should also store anything else that is on it.
---
You always need to check there inventory first to see if what they have offered is real?
---
It's funny how it took them 9 or so month to finally fix this.
---
Speed Demon in combination with Adrenal Reaction AND Life Giver indeed regens your health.
---
AngryTurtle made a video about this in november last year.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W1DPhUCRpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W1DPhUCRpQ)
---
I play stealth so never use PA other than for farming lead, and the Chinese stealth suit is much better for my build in nuke zones. 
---
But a full health, non-stealth tank build would need PA in the nuke zone.
---
I‚Äôm trying connect it with another foundation so I can. I was using floating foundations; Tip: it‚Äôs too much of a hassle to build this way.
---
Edit: was able to transfer support to new foundation. Still wonder if there is any other way though
---
like set player Vendor items to either script or caps, per item/machine?
---
The wall paper is nice cause seeing the crappy interior walls suck.
---
Rejoice at his presence! 
---
For the mothman loves you and wants you to be happy! He  bestows upon you a great gift and is looking out after you!
---
Feel free to add me too. I'm the most casual player there is and I do whatever I feel like doing at the time lol. I like doing events, and will usually join almost all of them unless I'm in the middle of something, but sometimes I also just like riding my Mr. Fuzzy ride or seeing how high I can get my jetpack to go. My handle is Fallocaust.
---
Yesüëçüèª
---
I'm the opposite, in FO and ES I usually play in 3rd person but that's mostly due to mods making my character look.....interesting :P.  
---
FO76 I only really play in 1st person and when I'm wandering around I occasionally switch to 3rd for a bit until combat starts.
---
(bethesda accepts idea, makes script vendorbot, but limits scrip amount to 100)
---
(anger)
---
[edit: not per item, max player amount to have]
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter how much space or solutions they will give you if it‚Äôs limited space. You will still complain it‚Äôs not enough space.
---
Hey, dumb question. Can you apply the skin without resetting your camp? I like my camp and I don't want to re-do it.
---
Yeah I've 5 mules now not that they have anything exciting on just not going to drop good scrip.
---
That's the one I usually use. Recently it hasn't been popping up for me at all, probably just bad luck
---
could search the vendors inside whitespring resort, to buy
---
That's usually part of my rotation. Its usually already cleared out or just a basic wendigo though. I went in yesterday and it was all diseased level 1 eye bots hahahahaha ????
---
Before the season launched I was looking forward to ammo converter but when I got it day one I was massively disappointed. There are a couple things that look ok a bit farther down but that was biggest thing for me to look forward to. Ah a shame
---
the "vengeful" mothman is the one you can kill, but sometimes it jumps to you, and hugs you in a horrifying way as you try to shoot him from point blank range
---
[edit: word]
---
Honest question where you banned? 
---
I've heard that those instigating this exploit have had their accounts banned for it.
---
I think it's only fair, we're all contributing to the event. Unfortunately you'll always get that one person steamrolling in and killing the legendary before others can reach it.
---
I said this other day lol
---
Yeah we need event emotes. Defend run collect or switch etc.
---
Haha. Glad it‚Äôs working for you now. Must be random.
---
To the people who open my nuke machine when walking by and not close it. I remember who you are.
---
Also lockable power switches would be nice!
---
Wow nice!
---
I think you should be able to replay the main quests again with your levelled character make the experience harder
---
you can get the high capacity backpack for about 100 more weight units. But not sure if it adds weight.
---
[edit but you know this already, Quick, switch to completely unarmed)
---
I found faction more annoying then 500 bullion but not sure how much faction rep it costs you
---
Just barely above you. I play a bunch and haven‚Äôt really missed  to many of the tasks and I hit like 52 today. So they must have gotten a hell of a lot of xp to finish it or atoms.
---
They want to keep you grinding BS like this because there is no actual content.  If you're not going past the atom store and buying fluff garbage, you aren't any use to them.  Stop buying stupid-assed skins, and maybe they'll get the message.
---
So Bethesda has turned us into wageslaves for their game?
---
So how do you survive a nuke zone without the 90% radiation damage reduction from PA?
---
Me too! The man!!
---
Content isn‚Äôt horrible and at least it is t like other battle passes where you have a free one and a paid one.
---
I was getting 4-5k XP with 6 int during each wave of line in the sand during the double XP weekend.
---
If I had stacked 46 int?  mind blown.
---
The queen should be guaranteed 3
---
Id rather, like its been said before, 3 star enemies be rarer but guarantee 3 star drops
---
The odds of it being what you want are low anyway
---
At your tinkers station.
---
It only takes 5 days of moderate farming to get 1k gold (the amount you get if you keep all the quest loot for yourself), while it literally takes weeks to maximize rep with a faction, so I am not so sure that would be the best choice... ü§î
---
BUT, there's an easy glitch (if it still works) to maximize raiders rep in like 30 minutes...so...
---
Where did u find that quantum logo/light?  I have had crap luck finding something similar for my build.
---
If you are on Xbox and have game pass you get game for free now but I agree with what you say. Got game on disk when first came out. It isn‚Äôt free by anymore means.
---
That's the one I usually use ! I still have to get 2 more for the challenges in a day tho lol
---
So you saw they didn't have what you asked for and still put your weapon up for trade?
---
Got a link, please?
---
Yeah would be very nice. Also the wall paper doesnt work around windows üò¢
---
Gauss minigun for SBQ!
---
Me and my friends stripped armor went to lake grafton and let miralurk knock us down and when we shot em and revived. Knocked this out in five min for four people.
---
Same here, I've kept my mouth shut. Don't want them to fix this.
---
Pretty much all the dailies and weeklies and I just got past half way mark. You get a crap ton of xp all the time and it can push you over I guess. Or they used atoms to finish it off
---
Now i want a shield pistol/auto pistol combo out of this. I know you said for melee but maybe make pistol builds more fun to use with a riot shield infront of you.
---
Seems really dumb I know.
---
I'd agree with this guy you've burned yourself out my dude. Have a good little break and play something else until the next season starts? When you come back maybe try and pace yourself a bit. :)
---
Just doesn't seem like a scam. Plus surely alarm bells were ringing when he offered a trade of legacy for a sub par weapon. If it sounds too good to be true haha
---
Why not price it so it moves?   I mean, sure, Fed76 may say it's worth 62K, but if you can't sell it for that or get the equivalent in trade,what's the point?  To collect as much great stuff as possible or what?   BTW, I flatout hoard junk scrap, so no judgement here, just curious.  
---
If we had unlimited storage, I'd start seriously working on putting together Secret Service armor sets:   here's my hunter one for meat week, troubleshooter for bots, etc.  It would be alot of fun.
---
So You missed the great opportunity with Buy My Stuff. 
---
Buy My Stuff -y,y...
---
Much better.
---
I personally buy up all fuel at 1 cap each.
---
I'm getting the distinct impression from this post and another one that you can't.
---
It's not really worth anything to be honest it just scrip and I'm at max cap most of the time anyway. Just I've started just dropping loads to people at events.
---
How did a group just destroy your Purifiers?
---
You gotta be real quick. I do it with melee. He jumps around almost after every hit.
---
I'm not using any of their skins.   This must be like the tenth post I've seen where using a skin results in a problem, on all different kinds of things.
---
I have been playing this game for about 2 weeks and this has been by far the best online experience I have ever had. The community is so friendly and always so helpful. Is this a dream?
---
The way nuke zones work now and looking at rewards from SBQ there‚Äôs zero point in wasting time by running silos legitimately. It takes 1 minute to start launch prep with PoA glitch and 2-3 with photo mode glitch
---
They want your $$. So buy atoms or get first. That all they care about.  Which does suck
---
I was hoping when I saw the wastelanders factions initially that we‚Äôd get an event where the raiders would attack the settler base and raid them for supplies. You would have to choose a faction and would only win if your faction won. 
---
Maybe one at Foundation where the raiders try to raid the base and then maybe one at crater where the settlers try to get their stuff back.
---
I thought that would be the end game. Or at least until the secret service (another faction I was disappointed with what they did)
---
Yeah, HA was a little tricky.  :)
---
Welp, here goes 1500 atoms
---
Thanks would of not looked there for it
---
Because that's not a review of the game, it's just you moaning that - unlike a significant number of players across the world - there's something wrong with your system.
---
But yeah, sure. Whatever.
---
I once saw someone's house as a big cube floating in the air, no windows nor doors (and ofc vendor is inside). Not sure if it was intentional or not, but it looked cool. Reminded me of the movie Cube
---
Just cant see it go to waste lol
---
Yep. I make my caps selling legendaries. I don't want to sell them all at once due to the cap limit, I'm already struggling on what to buy with the caps and now I'm just buying any plans I don't know yet. 3500 and up is my price, with the god roll ones going over 10k. They don't sell all at once, but I don't want them to.
---
Bethesda really screwed up with the potential of both these factions. They should have had a more varied set of quests that could have been done for both sides.
---
You remember the name of the guy that dropped the bomb? There were a couple people on a tent in mine too and I was on Xbox
---
"Part of the structure might not be accessible."
---
Well boo-urns to that. I was looking forward to that skin but there aint no way I'm rebuilding my camp lol. Even blueprinting won't help since I have it half-way off a cliff because the view rocks and ol Bethy won't let me place any blueprinted buildings anywhere near it.
---
You failed to notice that most accounts were not banned but temporarily suspended. Big difference. 
---
The emails read that Bethesda were checking to account to see if any duped items existed. 
---
I'm guessing people then recovered the accounts after Bethesda found that nothing was wrong with them. As in Innocent! 
---
Sure maybe a few got through but most SUSPENSIONS were pending investigation. 
---
As you seem to be a fan of crap analogies. What if you were in a store and witnessed a robbery but the robbers were gone by the time the police came. They start to question you but then just arrest and charge you for the crime. No trial. Same difference. 
---
Basically a lot of those that got suspended got back in due to being innocent. Haha
---
Pretty disappointed with free content ?  Not gunna lie, it's FREE!
---
Chinese Stealth Suit has 99% reduction, has decent armor (140DR/ER), comes with 3 legendary effects (fall damage, sneak and stealth) and you can also wear a backpack on top. It's a great non-PA option for nuke zones. The other one is hazmat suit, but that comes with no armor, no effects and your can't wear a backpack.
---
On what planet (obvious pun intended) has anyone finished the legendary run? If I‚Äôm not at work I‚Äôm playing and have just now finished the first chapter.
---
Currently I run a mix of the Chinese PA (helmet and legs) with the rest being the shadowed liberty prime. Needless to say I'm pretty bummed the first reskin of the Chinese PA we're going to get is red instead of a black version to match the Liberty Prime...
---
If it's wood armor then it is real. The 4th effect comes from shrouded mod.
---
I got 6-11K on Fed76.   Of course, real value is only what will actually result in a sale or trade.
---
That one bullet was a special one.
---
They should add a lego punji board variation into the game tbh.
---
So what that guy did was fucked up... I mostly play the meta... But that's what I enjoy, I however have never, nor will never try to force someone down the path I take unless they ask. I really would hate if that guy made you think of us as assholes. So I'd like to apologize on his behalf. Your good to play the game the way you want, just please don't think that al of us are like him... Most of us hate people like him just as much as you.
---
We have an arrangement, no worries
---
What's wrong with you? I'm a full health build, and you are embarrassing yourself.
---
You on xb1?
---
It's just a shame that there's always that one person who comes and kills it before anyone else has a chance to get a hit in.
---
Still don't have tesla Armor.
---
i mean i only played for 1/2 of x2 exp even and got like 30 levels just from the repeatable and know a few other who finished it, its called being effective and pouring a fuck ton of hours into it. i got the 100 thing like 4 times a run from westek and only takes 5min to clear it out and 3-4 to load a new world
---
Thanks.
---
Sure am GT: WaZSuB
---
I changed my build to stealth commander. I use a BE Pipe Rifle I'm doing it right? joke at the side, I wouldn't buy a duped fixer, because it would ruin the game to me. I would rather use the 3* suppressor one I got from purveyor. Or just my loved BE Pipe Rifle. By the way has someone 0.38?
---
Sorry for peoples down votes... Here take my upvote
---
Yeah, it's frustrating.  I'm sorry it happened to you.    Hopefully this "not landing" and not being able to cripple her will be fixed with Update 21.
---
I mean I have nothing against meta players. I love you guys when I'm trying my best and getting pounded into a bloody pulp during public events and you just come in and absolutely fucking destroy whatever was beating on me. You guys are great.
---
And for the rare occasion I find one of you who thinks they can bully other players who aren't meta, I have my gamma gun. Then suddenly everyone is "It was just a joke bro!"
---
Youre over the weight limit. Until you bring it down below the 1800lbs everything you drop will be destroyed. So get rid of anything that you are willing to lose until your below that weight.
---
So the "weight limit" is 1800? That sounds manageable for me
---
Perfect. In the morning I can hop on and do it for you if you'd like, aside from the plushie that is, dont think I can build that at your camp.
---
I got the Chinese stealth armor and then sided with the raiders, you can buy it if you missed it but it‚Äôs 4000 gold which is absolutely ridiculous. The settlers big draw is the gauss shotgun and the raiders is the gauss mini gun. I thought the characters in the raiders had more substance, plus I‚Äôm a heavy gunner so I wanted the gauss mini, the settlers characters just felt kind of flat. There‚Äôs other really cool stuff that you don‚Äôt have to be allied to get like the grocers and chemist backpacks which are amazing. It doesn‚Äôt really matter who you side with but whoever you choose you get a nice little rep bump
---
100 percent yes. Todd Howard and his team from Bethesda will come to your doorstep and trap you in the game forever. All those NPC's didn't start out as NPC's...
---
Oh yeah us bloodied builds have nightmares just filled to the brim of gama guns. Lol
---
Wow, really?   I won't even report in if I have to do it in the blast zone.  Once was enough.   That event failed, btw.   What do you like better about it?
---
I‚Äôm actually now a level 13 and I got it last year
---
I actually think they dropped it to 1500 but it was a while back to counter the dupers that were carrying 100s of weapons.
---
like the 3-star whatever weapon w/ scorched mod, adds 4th effect
---
Oh that might be a little harder but I'll find a way I guess. In my case I wanted to collect one of everything
---

---
how is this possible?
---
(Pint-Sized slasher kills them)
---
It‚Äòs because of the 10k score challenge. Bethesda really didn‚Äôt think this through but, well, what‚Äôs new?
---
The other day some guy kept trying to lock pick my collection, I would hear the squeaky lockpick noises and come out of my shack with my shotgun out, and he'd stop and act innocent, walking over to my vendor etc. Then he did it for like the third time and I walked out with my gamma gun and he looked at me, stared for a second, emoted bye now and started sprinting away lol.
---
VADKAA !!!!
---
This is Bethesda. The poor attention to detail, unacceptable and obvious bugs, lack lustre items available, the feeling that most of the content is lazy or phoned in, is ALL Bethesda.
---
All they care about is short term revenue. They're more than happy to burn their reputation and player base for it, it seems.
---
Without significant changes to senior management and increased resourcing, this is just the Bethesda norm.
---
When I built my bloodied character I specifically went Rifleman/gunslinger so I could double dip on perks with a BE250 Pipe Revolver.
---
Oh yeah, I had that yesterday.  I think I opened up my map fixed it. But you can drop things from your favorite wheel in NW
---
I can't remember if it was on the main sites articles, or a datamine forum discussing with some of the members, but the main site is www.fed76.info - loads of useful tips and explanations under the articles section
---
There's a way to play fo76 on gamepass for pc without having to install the game on the os drive. 
---
[This Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hp9a5x/psa_fix_for_noregionping_on_gamepass/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) has worked for me and should work for most users. 
---
I recommend placing a shortcut to your my games folder and saving the ini on the desktop b/c the ini file likes to be deleted after playing the game and it's a hassle to dive into your game folder and finding the my games folder each time you wanna play.
---
Reduce item hording WHAT
---
I got a plan for the assault rifle yesterday that was marked as unknown, but I could have sworn I had all the weapon plans.   Now I wonder.
---
Lmfao this might be my new favorite post on here.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC let‚Äôs do a deal :)
---
Im one of those one shot bloodied people and i purposefully heal myself for uranium fever and the like so others can still get the legendary
---
Wrong subreddit my friend :) try the trading sub
---
All good I have a plushie I can move.
---
it really was beatiful, it was the first time being in a scorched earth event and fighting for 45 mins straight to kill a scorched queen, it felt like an actual chalenge for everyone...
---
There isnt. Storing or scrapping the foundation i sthe only way. They arent selectable otherwise.
---
Every time I see a player emoting follow me, I'm thinking,  
---
"Why should I follow you? Am I going to regret this? (Probably!)
---
I'm all in with you on this, but it's not the worst.. The worst is when you put shit ton of damage into SBQ and when you run towards it it's empty. It's also so frustrating when you spend so much ammo, resources and time killing legendary enemies who just fall through textures or bots exploding and fly away god knows where or legendary enemies roll away somewhere where you can't get them like fissures or so far there is no way to tell where they are. They need to rework the loot system completely.
---
There were some brilliant characters in 76 pre wastelanders. It was like exploring a graveyard, all we had were the stories of those that came before us and it was up to us to carry on their legacy. Unfortunately, we got roped up in whining about bugs and no npc‚Äôs and derailed the whole project, so they had to scramble it into Wastelanders. Now it‚Äôll be just like every other Bethesda Fallout game, which I don‚Äôt mind, as I still enjoy Bethesda‚Äôs contribution a lot. Unpopular opinion: Bethesda‚Äôs Mr handy‚Äôs are way cooler than BI‚Äôs. I think Wastelanders is a far more commercially viable game for sure, but it‚Äôs a shame a bold experiment like Year 1 had to be shit on so heavily.
---
No, with PLM the new packs are not automatically shown again, once you've decided not to open it.
---
Then no clue.
---
Sell the extra weight
---
Ps4
---
si daje grazie Bro
---
The ones I make have 500 in them
---
Unless OP is near a vendor, he'll need rl years to reach one. With a carry weight of nearly 1800 the toon moves slower than a snail.
---
thats just pathetic, looking for others approval...
---
i guess not every one us has the will power to not be that petty
---
The gauss rifle just isn't that great, and it's not an easy enemy.   I just break out my two shot ultracite gatling laser now and get it over with.
---
The favorites being "un-favourited" thing is because they are quest items so when you log they are re issued to you
---
Weird sometimes they hold 500 sometimes they hold 350 once I got one the held 257 and it said it was full
---
Yes its wood! Thanks for clearing it up. Was worried because i liked the affixes
---
All are the same, you can get that time down to about 20 minutes with hacker and lock pick 3. Congratulations tho, seeing you‚Äôre name on the screen is such a great feeling
---
Please make sure you are not on any public teams while completing ‚ÄûI am become death‚Äú - when a team member launches a nuke this will autocomplete your quest and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. Source, happened to me and I‚Äôm still ever so slightly salty about it ;)
---
Yeah, I'd wait for more info from other players before I would ever try it personally.   When I rebuilt my camp, it took me two hours.   Maybe I'm just slow, or maybe it just really takes that long to rebuild a fully developed camp.   I don't know, but I do know I'm not willing to do that for a skin on my c.a.m.p.
---
Outdated list.
---
sResourceArchive2List = ImprovedHealthBars.ba2
---
Rename the Fallout76Custom.ini to Project76Custom.ini and it should work.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs gonna take 14146 hours to reach to a vendor. :(
---
Yeah, I can understand that.
---
Good luck even on Bnet that mod was CTD everytime I tried it
---
ooops this was supposed to be on market. Lol thanks!
---
Thanks, I'll make sure not too.
---
I just started the Encryptid event. I ran over to a pylon to be a conduit, but people had already taken them. It was vulnerable. I ran a bit, to find the Sheepsquatch. I vats'ed and jumped and looked around, killed a few robots while looking, and then the event was over. I never saw it.
---
Couldn't loot it. Some guy waved, to show people where the body was. We ran over. And then he told us the body dissapeared. Best 2000 caps I ever spent.
---
Why the capital letters man??!
---
And yes, this is the nicest sub because we are all angels trying to play the hellish game ever.
---
oh dang okay, will try that. Thanks!
---
Shit happens
---
Wait, there's a body to loot from?
---
Two options  if you want to keep stuff- 1/ pay for fallout 1st and get the scrap weighs nothing. 2/ get a friend involved to help you. This may take a bit of time and be a slight pain in the butt. Create a spare character. Take main characters favourite items / junk / ammo / chems etc anything you cant say bye bye too and give them to your friend. With your new secondary character log in and meet up with your friend taking the items back and putting them in your stash. This may take several character swap overs and a bit of time. I cant take credit for this idea. It was a friend of mine. She named her character something related to Banking so she knows that one is purely a holding character.
---
That's why I said usually
---
Yeah I have, I didn't get my score back
---
Yeah, I also play they game pretty casually, I don't follow any builds, I have a build of my own (with some advice of more experienced friend). I don't do tons of damage or can survive everything but it doesn't stop me from doing most of the things solo including clearing silos to launch nukes (I know it's nothing special, but first time I did it alone I was happy). I always share cards with people in public teams and try to stay around when they do something. Some people are just je.. bad. Got removed a few times from the team for no reason, oh well, it's public random team, can't except much from it. The majority of players are very nice tho.
---
Pure carnage and mayhem. Better chance at High Rad Fluid from enemy spawns, no fence sitters, and its more of a 'fight' than waiting her out in the clear.
---
I would love if they tweaked the event so that SBQ stays in bast zone and keeps spawning ads , so that we have to go and murder her on home turf to beat the event. with a guaranteed  3\* reward.
---
You will find after a few more levels it isn't a challenge currently.
---
You're not wrong
---
I used to have an issue with plasma cores for an example I would make like 15 or so full cores are with 500 charge then after depleting a core and loading a new one in I expected the next core to load in at 500 but it wasn't the case it loaded in at around 450 or so I believe and it kept getting lower from there. However I actually found a nice work around to keep my cores at 500 every time I reload basically what you do is soon as your character starts to pop out the empty core to reload automatically quicky press left on the D-Pad to swap weapons then just swap back to your Gatling Plasma and you should have max charge again
---
Thanks will try definitely try this
---
Check Bloodied\_Mess videos. I've been told the Word and now I'm spreading it.
---
Did not know fallout 1st had that as a benefit

I've noticed with gatling lasers that they sometimes try to reload before the core is empty. Does that happen with plasma gatlings as well?
---
From what I know it only works if you just made fresh cores from the tinkers workbench, it won't work with cores that have been already used they have to be freshly made
---
Ok thanks I tried it and it worked perfectly I think it just has to load a fresh core so even ones you‚Äôve picked up will work with the workaround as long as they‚Äôre full
---
From my experience I don't think so i never had an instance where my character would attempt to load a new core even if the current one still had charge
---
My go to is the cart just to the left of the lucky mucker.
---
always get the perforating magazine
---
Interesting, i've stopped using gatling lasers for that reason alone since it's really annoying but good to hear it doesn't affect all energy gatlings.
---
Glad to be of help man its definitely frustrating when you make a fresh batch of cores only to have them lose charge each time you reload but with this workaround I found accidentally it definitely helps
---
The deep?
---
Capitalizing a title my friend.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me before if you either switch weapons or hold x or square or whatever it is on pc it will let you shoot the remaining bullets
---
What you're largely describing is what I call Anonymous Social Syndrome.
---
A lack of empathy toward other people online, caused by the anonymity of the internet, and compounded by the lack of behavioral consequences.
---
The acronym of it is also pretty apt.
---
\[Edit\]That is not to say these people are victims. Everyone has An understanding of right and wrong. A will and a conscience. Over my experience of the past two decades, I've come to view how people behave online, is likely who they truly are deep down when their public mask is removed.
---
Ouch. Seems I've hit some nerves. Take this as a reminder that others online aren't just emotionless pixels on your screen. If you need to verbally attack, threaten, SWAT or tell someone to end their life over a videogame, you need to completely unplug and seek mental help.
---
I usually never use Gatling lasers since it was a pain getting fusion cores for those and my PA
---
Yeah, i usually bash the gun but it's annoying when you're in a crowd of enemies andvyou're out of ap due to dodgy.
---
Yeah true, but i have a gauss minigun now so fusion cores are the past.
---
No problem here, but then I am not using any other mod that mods the HUD .)

Great Job! I'm happy, when I'm under 300 üôà

If you were on PS4 I'd help you out. I have a stimpak account. It has thousand of stims hahaha I donate them to people and sometimes people donate them to me it's great.

Whats wasteland warfare?

By the whitesprings golf club near the pool.
---
It be cool to see the more brutal side of the raider faction. Those dog races people bet on would be interesting to bet caps on but the difference is the raiders would use captured settlers with explosive Collars the need to run around a track or else they go boom! To make it even more interesting let‚Äôs put Ferals ghouls too. The winner would be decided by either A: they tire out and get eaten by the ghouls or B: the try to escape then they go Boom!
---
I have nightmares about assaultrons and mirelurk kings. It's got better now I have the vats perk to target limbs, shoot the assaultrons limbs off and shotgun it from behind as it's crawling along. I take possibly too much joy in dismantling them after all the deaths I've suffered at their hands.
---
build a nice big floating foundation and the sbq will land on it every time as long as you dont use atomic shop skins.
---
It does have that option. I dont have 1st as I can't afford it (it is too much in Aus). What I do with Junk is put the super rare junk in display cabinets. Scrap the junk. Make sure all weapons and armor in use is repaired. Make ammo / drugs etc (since i have the ammo weighs less nothing?) perk. Put junk in bulk. Sort out what is staying. Sell or ditch. I havent done events yet so when I do I will have a second character that I will use as a holding for rarities / plans etc.  with weapons / armour I want to keep I spec them to their lightest weight possible as I can always remake the mod for it if I need too). I looked up on the internet / reddit various ways to manage inventory. Like how much do I need and pair it down. If I am then going on a rebuilding spree I make sure I have bulk amounts before I start then ditch when done. It can take time because -you can run out of your daily caps limit and script - it takes a bit of time to swap items to new character.  What I call sneaky inventory bloat seems to be fusion / plasma cores and stimpaks / radx / radaway and misc drugs. Good luck. I swear half the time is managing inventory.
---
Thank you. This helped a lot!
---
Half of the Atomic Shop items should‚Äôve been in the base game. üòí
---
No one runs away with your flux.  If you die it gets destroyed and doesn't appear in bags.
---
i see them amount outside the church in Berkeley Springs, &amp; they are frequently in my base outside Charleston station
---
I'd drop most if not all of the common junk. It is the easiest to replace.  Then if you want to keep the rest, I'd invest in some weight reduction armor.
---
Thanks!
---
Awesome thank you!

pylon V13 i had like 4 just yesterday.
---
THE JET WILL MAKE YOU JITTERY
---
A status on 76. Here goes
---
It's better than launch, it's not the best game but you can play without falling through the map or crashing for hours. It's a lot less laggy but the [spoil] in the pip boy is broken. So when you go to apparel or misc your game freezes and it takes forever.
---
Vats 9/10 times doesn't work, adrenaline is broken, the queen is easier than ever to take down outside nuke zones. Uhm cap limit is raised to 30k, scrip is at 1k still and 5k gold bullion. And the legendary run is a true grind. 
---
If other people can now finish what i started
---
people that take this ***BUSTED*** ass game this seriously need to get, the fuck, on.
---
salty downvotes from trogs that make death threats on the internet because cant separate video games from real life.
---
Cool I'll check V13 also! Appreciate the help
---
Ffr vs scorchbeasts else handmade.
---
Sometimes people are just keeping their vendor active when they're not actually playing.
---
I feel appreciated!
---
Haha I've been buying it any time I see it at some ones vender I have right now at this moment 11945 2mm electromagnetic cartridges
---
I don't run stabilized but that's really good to know. I run unyielding so I level fast, I might pick up that perk sometime in my next few levels. Thanks for the info.
---
No, no nerf. My HM still does 800-1000 non crits, while it's ~200 on paper.
---
If you have money you are actually right
---
If someone is on PS4 and need frogs for scout badge or something i have something like 10 in stock, so add me. I can give away them for free. My psn is Assass1n1191
---
Much improved from launch but still flawed. 
---
Imo the good outweighs the bad
---
I'm guessing event team would probably be best.
---
just to come back and confirm, that did work! Thanks a million!!!
---
it worked fine for me after doing the fixes /u/DismalDelay101 suggested :)
---
Yeah, I didn't know at first either and I was really confused where they came from and why they were along side the muties as well. Lol
---
What‚Äôs your lvl?
---
And to all the people who kill it instantly or do mass damage real quick. Go sit on a sharp stick
---
it does if you running lifegiver.  we welcome any extra challenge to our builds :)
---
Exactly. I tried to build the RR garage into my CAMP and whilst the foundations line up there is a horrible looking gap between the side door of the garage and of my house.
---
I‚Äôm having the same problem. I recently went through my stash again to try and get it down and I noticed that I had a missile launcher weighing 37 and 71 missiles stored that‚Äôs a lot of space for a gun I don‚Äôt use very often so I bit the bullet and scrapped it and converted the ammo. I didn‚Äôt really get on with the gun anyway tried to mod it but still found the accuracy was useless so no great loss.
---
Saddest title ever
---
Snake?... Snake?!... SNAKE!!!
---
you are now a certified nuke launcher
---
fixer vs queen, handmade for everything else is usually how I do it.
---
Yeah I currently have both my missile launchers up for sale because they are basically pointless and aren‚Äôt really that good, I might just go ahead a sell them to AI vendors which is what I‚Äôm gonna do alongside of scrapping.
---
I run at mostly full HP build, I have healing factor, adreal reaction, speed demon mutations and the lifegiver perk card.
---
Never noticed abnormal health regen. Maybe healing factor overwrites the bug?
---
Add far as I was aware it was has been patched out ü§î
---
"Impressive, most impressive."  
---
I suspect, but don't support, that someone is thinking, "Hmm, it needs something, maybe explosive bait?"  
---
To be completely clear, I will do not and will never support CAMP griefing, but some do, as in the scum from under the barrel of nuclear waste.
---
They can still have the blue prints from before it was patched
---
Nah if you had the stack of boards saved you can still place them as long as you don‚Äôt delete them
---
For some people it matters more than doing it legitimately or even just not caring about other people's perception of them, you could argue the world is rife with it when you consider social media.
---
Also your formatting off for the market
---
Fo4 there were no 2 or 3 stars
---
Can you tell me what BE250 means? I also read about a B2525 pistol? They're probably legendary affixes or something, but other than that I'm clueless :)
---
Saw a whole bunch when I went thru Wendigo Cave.
---
Oh, I see said the blind man
---
You need a hug
---
Yea but the 2nd one i have only 2* be handmade
---
I always try and buy from current team mates
---
My vampires swing speed puncturing power fist is so awesome, the health regen is so great for just tanking everything. I played a bloodied heavy gunner for 200+ levels until I started an unarmed alt recently, it feels like I‚Äôm playing a new game and I‚Äôm having way more fun than with my heavy gunner build
---
You haveing a stroke mate
---
I've got loads of stuff to do but get distracted by ............ oooo shiny
---
I also have 2 spare sets of Chinese armour weighing 10 from upgrading that I can‚Äôt do anything with. Can‚Äôt scrap or sell them which is annoying
---
That's why I have the door on the far right. It'doesn't get used anyway. 
---
If anything I would prefer them fixing the garage door on that, it's not only backwards but also has that opening problem where its open but its not and closed for other players etc.. That needs fixing..
---
It's the eggs I need... I think I gotta shoot them for those don't I?
---
Yeah i tried the heavy leather ghillie on my second char. If i use a 50cal half the screen gets covered by it in 1st person
---
Cheers I'll check there too :)
---
I think we also need an option for it to only open when powered.
---
Well done
---
Get a low level pistol and shoot it
---
Huh, yeah some things just don‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs the same with how I have found like 3 different power Armor chassis frames and I was like hey why don‚Äôt I sell this maybe it‚Äôll help someone out and I can make some decent caps, but nope can only sell the actual Armor that goes on it. Idk this game isn‚Äôt perfect I just wish they‚Äôd listen to the community a little more.
---
Trying to turn people in?
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I'm not a fan of those super-silly costumes. Nothing breaks immersion like seeing a guy run around in a cow outfit.
---
Thank you. Yeah that sucks but am lucky I haven't encountered the explosive bait grieving yet :)
---
Yes its the prefixes, be250 is bloodied, explosive, +250 dr while reloading.
---
I always try to help others who are down. If I can be a positive influence on someone else‚Äôs experience with the game, I enjoy that. It sucks when people see you down and don‚Äôt even help.
---
Good one
---
Buying a bobble head from a player vendor does not work. Source: Tried it, didn‚Äôt work.
---
After striking out in all the places I remembeedr sometimes finding them, I tried a few places recommended in Reddit posts. I found one at the fourth suggestion I tried. Thanks, Redditors!
---
There should also be variants without foundations so you can place them on your own foundations. Would make for a more neat and interesting build.
---
That looks really good. I had to do a double take when scrolling to see if that was Sims or Fallout. It looks great. Has a modern complex architectural design. Good work!
---
Yes its a scummy thing to shop bait then steal peoples stuff
---
What platform are you on? If its XB1 il join your team and help out.
---
I think it still fires faster, it's just that sometimes the game thinks you're trying to charge up the gun instead of firing so quickly so it messes up the fire rate
---
In camera mode the camera moves sooooooo slowly.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt doubt it i fuck it up every time
---
The trade sub always calls her a bitch and I'm just "she doesn't deserve that, she's actually a sweet old lady??"
---
Stop carrying junk on you when you shop and equip the lightfooted perk. It's not that hard, the game is too safe already.
---
shhh..............don't spoil the trade
---
Lmfao that gave me a good laugh.
---
You got lucky. I checked 9 or 10 spots before I finally found one.
---
Recent dupe has made god roll and legacy weapons more or less ubiquitous, as well as some of the rarer outfits and armor to a lesser extent.
---
If your on PA4 let's do a deal üòÉ
---
Trap camps are fun, creative, and ingenious at times. Easy to avoid for the wise.
---
Why do you think they would, when they unban known cheaters?
---
Just do as we all do and leave your junk at home when you go shopping.
---
Had it quite often on ps4 but I haven't noticed it recently
---
I do the scorch beast queen fight a lot for flux. Another way is to nuke white springs so you can got all the materials first, then nuke the specific area that has the nuked flora you need. For acid you can find an acid node and place your camp there for a constant stream of acid, I put my camp on a spot so I can have constant steel coming in.
---
\-Looks at all the people getting downvoted for just trying to help-
---
\-Looks at all the people getting downvoted for making jokes-
---
\-Looks at all the hug-a-duper posts proclaiming dupers to be moral messiahs getting upvoted-
---
Eh...
---
Fair point if they don‚Äôt ban the dupers but they ban the people who unknowingly received duped items then whats the point
---
If you have lockpick x3 and hacker x 3 you can avoid that entirely.
---
PS4 sadly but thanks
---
Bauhaus Style i¬¥d say... nice =)
---
Ahhh yeah that sounds so obvious. Thanks. And what does B2525 for a pistol mean?
---
Yes I‚Äôve seen that I only have 2 perhaps I‚Äôll just wait until I can get another lockpick card
---
I guess we know who is gonna start skipping leg day
---
If you craft them the number of rounds scales with intelligence
---
I have a friend like that in the game unfortunatly, non stop nagging that people aren't running bloodied and are being inefficient and complaining that its the only way to play the game. But the counter to that is that he isn't running bloodied himself "because its broken".
---
Yet he wants others to run it so they do the work for the events..
---
The punji board glitch isn't really a trap camp thing. If someone's in your vendor, you can open up your camp menu and place a stacked blueprint of punji boards where the person is standing. That's not a trap, that's just being a dick lol
---
A challenge, XP, fluxes, something to do - those are some other points to 3 star legendary enemies to answer your question.
---
Actually wise ass gun fu just triggers on death and is slow, its much faster to just stay in vats and hit the directional button to swap targets. You obviously missed the fucking point. Its not that i couldnt get hits/kills its the fact the dudes were deliberately trying to mow them down and not being considerate of others.  So take you " get good" attitude and shove it.
---
As for the legacies,  they are not in the lot pool for a reason. Im refering  specifically to explosive energy weapons. Shit like the survival mode weapons, dragons,double effect etc are fine because they perfrom like the other weapons that currently drop in the game. But weapons that were so OP the actually stoped them from droping and removed them from the loot pool....thats a different story. If someone didnt have one pre dupe, thats on them for putting the time in to trade up into one any one can do it just takes effort. Cant always get what ya want....so what you want duped explosive energy weapons going to be the new 76 participantion trophy. Get the fuck outta here
---
To top it off the dupe broke the  tr@demarket even worse. Now that people know there a bunch of legacies on the market thats all they ask for for trades, even for mediocre weapons. Hopefully it straightens out in the next few months,but right now its a disaster.
---
Oh that sucks I‚Äôm only have 8
---
Odd view but you're entitled to it. I see caffeine addicts everywhere these days.
---
Do you per chance play on PS4? Would love to purchase some extra .45!
---
The thing that gets me is when you get downed in NW and if you know you wont survive you have to wait until you die and it puts the text on the screen before you can even access the escape menu. Like holy fuck, I don't care that Im downed or in the process of seeing my stats. Let me exit the fucking match. It's already a multi step process just to get into a match. Stop wasting my time.
---
Get a Quad automatic railway rifle. The 40 round clip is perfect for gun fu in VATS
---
Try to see if you can get back in the cave where you find Lucky Lou. They had a fat stack of frogs in there, like 20 or so. Easily the most reliable spawn, as the only for sure spot was Whitesprings before Wastelanders
---
I do it just because I craft a lot of alcohol and really enjoy the animation of pouring out booze on downed players :D Quack Surgeon is the best perk. I just use that plus Max rank Spiritual Healer + Max rank E.M.T and bam, full hp and it looked hilarious.
---
Running a full medic build is one of the most fun things to do, all my friends donate all their fuel to me so I can keep spamming flames at them :D Friendly Fire is also one of the best perks.
---
Possibly.. I don't do healing factor, but scaly skin, adrenal reaction, speed demon and carnivore. Lifegiver maxxed.  My health regenerates from the last sliver back to nerd rage threshold often.
---
With explosive it breaks your sneak so u lost those lovely 3x damage bonus. I‚Äôd stick with ffr on both. I use whichever I have the most ammo for and fixer on the queen for the extra damage.
---
I actually killed the scorch queen and got a standard minigun + 100 ammo earlier today (no legendaries). It was weird but I don't mind as I'm low level and find everything useful.
---
I agree that it's not a trap to do that, all the way. It's definitely "trapping" but it's all around lazy. However some trappers use the punjis to make walls and arrange them into death mazes,or other traps, that don't require going into build mode. Those are cool, I salute them.
---
go round and kill all the robots b4 you shut down the reactor, then you just have to walk round and repair the pipes. or you could just photomode glitch through the door like most ppl do these days.
---
Put some unyielding armor on and go below 20% health before you craft.
---
There a pond just down from 76 near the lumber yard always seems to have 5 or more flapping about

Explosive doesn't break sneak as long as a suppressor is on... thats what i thought anyways

Atleast he would get the 20 atons from 7600h played

Haƒ±ahauaha perfect
---
I find myself having no issues finding ammo or legendary guns I want since I ignore the meta, Mostly medic build so I just run around with junkies stuff I like, my healy flamer, and whatever silly guns I like to mess with, this week its a Two Shot Missile Launcher. Next week? Who knows! 
---
Personally I find the whole idea of bloodied/unyielding/sneak/fixer/vats/mt dew/doritos a really boring way to play but I'm not going to trash talk anyone who does do it. People really need to stop thinking that games can only/should be played one way.
---
One time this level 12 guy was at whitespring and he was being mowed down by robots so I ran up to him stim packed him and killed every last one of those robots and once I knew he was at a distance he was safe i left the server to go to a new one I never knew what happened to him
---
Ha ha my raider punk is wearing mine
---
These junk walls best snap because without snapping junk walls mods on fallout 4 they were useless, you couldn‚Äôt put them within a foot of each other. 
---
Someone link this point to the community managers because this would make them a waste of atoms for most people
---
So.....about 5 minutes supply then?
---
Ah, didn't know NW had that option. Thanks for the tip!
---
Yeah that would be cool too. 
---
Instead of the red star we would have one big white start and little stars circling it. I really want a Enclave one with jet-black colors and Enclave logo! I am a team bad guys member after all. üòè
---
why wouldn't I rez a downed player? it's the right thing to do, gets them back in the fight sooner, it saves them ammo, caps and crafting materials (none of it's junk), if we're going to protect the future of humanity, we need to protect humanity so they can have that future, and I have over 100lb of super stimpaks, and I suppose there is sometimes a daily to rez a player
---
My location is between wayward and slocum joe, forest region.
---
Plans are 10-20% of suggested price. Don't offer camp plans, those don't sell. For armor mods: everything other than ultra light or deep pocketed plans are hard to sell imo. But: some special plans can sell quite high, like BoS chest plan for combat armor.
---
Almost all chems are 10caps. Exceptions: calmex (20caps maybe), antibiotics (full price), disease cure (again full price), vendor price lowering mentats (again you can try selling for full price, 35caps i guess). You can always charge less, but those are some chems that sell even without a discount.
---
Food doesn't sell, only canned meat stew (most i got was 25caps) and other xp boosters.
---
Treasure maps: forest doesn't sell, others sell for up to 100, cranberry bog can go even higher. You can charge more if you have identical copies. I gift forest maps to new players and hold to any other map (zero weight, i can dig them up myself, but those will probably always sell for a minimum of 100, so it is a good cap sink / investment).
---
Check if you can craft sought outfits or modded underarmor, try to offer some and see if they sell. This depends on your location. You can probably sell underarmor easier in the starting region.
---
Junk is depending on your playstyle. If you explore and loot a lot you can go low here, but most profitable are: screws, crystal, circuits, cork, gold and one of the fibre glass ones (3-4 each). Honorable mentions: acid, plastic, adhesive @ 2 caps.
---
For ammo i offer .308, .45, 5.56, .50cal, 5mm, shotgun shells and fuel, all for 1 cap.
---
Cores are selling really slow. I offered full fusion cores for 39caps and still didn't sell. I guess it depends on your location, more high level visitors means more sells here.
---
Im still getting only chinese swords and frags. Haven't got one handmade yet, maybe they really rare?
---
Damn you lined those beds up perfectly, I‚Äôm gonna try that now. I‚Äôve had two of them Othman beds lined up and they are so short they look like they‚Äôre for toddlers lol

Hey! It's you!

This conversation is amazing

Ditch the extractor for a start - they don‚Äôt produce material anywhere near fast enough and you have to come back very regularly to collect what it does make....better to use that budget to make your base nicer.
---
Update: this reminded me of the ‚Äúflamingo‚Äù cost spreadsheet from ages ago....not my work but great for working out where your budget went:

Somebody really isn‚Äôt being given adequate testing time.

Why not consider putting these in the PTS? I get the exclusivity and surprise factor but we will see them from dataminers anyway and the best rewards you advertise pre event

Please place foot on tilted Lego so the corner is the first point of contact

Go inside the garage, rotate the door. It spawns backwards or something. But that usually works for me. Also, if you plan on moving your camp, make sure you remove both doors otherwise its a pain to place the blueprint at your new location.
---
You're welcome.  I am so happy you found one.  :)
---
This is an awesome idea, like liberty prime on steroids just destroying everything in its path. I would seriously love a more challenging boss fight, also the roaming idea is super cool because I would like to fight in different places besides fissure site prime

Wow I nearly shit my fucking pants seeing all those junk walls/barricades!

Too bad my main characters raider CAMP is right next to monongah mine üôÇ

Google works so well try it first then make a educated comment.......

I sell them for 25 caps a piece.
---
How? No armor?
---
*salutes* Ad Victorium
---
Like, painfully slow. It makes no sense lol
---
No other skins for marine other than ghillie - atomic skins are for scout and wood or leather aren‚Äôt they? So annoyed if I‚Äôve missed a marine skin.....
---
From pictures marine ghillie skin is rubbish though - not even a base armor colour change behind the weeds they‚Äôve glued on
---
it worked for me too
---
Hmm, thinking of doing a BoS combat medic build when they arrive. My current char I built to be a combination of Scribe and heavy weapon Knight
---
We can‚Äôt datamine server side things but it kinda makes sense to me
---
Copper also collects ore, capped at 10 ore. I think I will remove it from my cap as I have a tons of copper scrap from other sources. It will free up some camp budget.
---
YouTube channel idea? Lol "hello YouTube and welcome back to Appalachia Pickers: Reclamation Edition!"
---
Explosive vs ffr &amp; fixer vs handmade is never clear cut...
---
For SBQ non explosive is best + fixer has lower vats ap cost and better sneak than handmade so fixer probably wins (unless ap regen glitch happens...)
---
In other scenarios explosive might be better if you invest more than 3 special points into demolition expert and don‚Äôt have other beneficial cards that you could invest in instead (but otherwise couldn‚Äôt - thinking adrenaline when fixed, gun fu, etc). Handmade whilst having a higher vats ap cost does have less recoil and spread than the fixer so is better for free aim given same legendary effects.
---
I would go ffr personally as only run with 3 intelligence.....which may reflect in the quality of this post
---
If you reach 1800, everything you drop will be instantly destroyed. So, soon you have to start a second mule.
---
Just to check, you dix buy the raider or the bundle with both in right? Okay, good, just checking.
---
So with me, on xbox one, it said I had it but there was nothing there like you are finding. I had to go into game management and download a 10mb file and that only showed up under ready to install after a reboot of my xbox.
---
I'm hoping even if you don't have an xbox it sparks some ideas for the steam, ps5 and other versions of the game you might need to check. If that is the case then you still not done, restart game, go into skins and then tick each item. Except for the clothes, backpack and PA stuff, they need to be built.
---
FYI the gun sight on the Gatling is broken with the extra-large mag even on the normal non-skinned version. I just use it without the sight since it not only gets out of the way but I can also aim better and hip-fire accuracy is better without the sight.
---
I sell them for 50 caps each, but only when I have two or more for one location...buy them and dig multiple times.
---
I don‚Äôt know anything about builds. I go with the perks that feel fine to me. I have fun. All this META sounds like way too much effort.
---
u/ladydevann any update on what is happening with this system? obviously this was not thought through. Grinding to level 5000+ to max out all perk cards is just insane, i hope this gets reworked asap

Well I guess I can stop building little rooms around the workbench now..

That happened to me the other day.  I would run for the edge of the blast zone, die, then get respawned back in the middle.  It's an endless loop.
---
I don't understand this sub we the most welcoming and helpful gaming community around yet we down vote people with genuine questions
---
It's a game mechanic that is, actually, not an issue. This is sort of the same as demanding free scrapboxes for everyone. Fallout 1st should sort you out.
---
Sure many  know the unique pain that is dropping or selling to bot good scrip items.
---
[Everyone liked that]
---
are you talking about the rad/atom camo F1st got, the yellow camo? if so you havent missed it for marine, its for scout, leather and perhaps one more thus far. marine and combat hansnt gotten it yet. as for various ghille skins, those are score-only rewards.
---
What it look like on the inside?
---
While that is true, the fix is changing the meta. Having the same meta for nearly 2 years now is mind numbingly dull. And the gap between the meta weapons and the other 95% is terrible.
---
Actually you're right I remember that one too.
---
Im gonna be rolling in donuts soon! Wierd ingredient now I I think about it....
---
Very well put.
---
Hey Fluffy!!! üòä
---
That‚Äôs only about 5 minutes of pew pew pew :(
---
I have a simple solution for you;
---
Step 1. Do not collect mini nukes or missiles
---
Step 2. Scrap or sell of missile launchers or fat mans
---
Step 3. Realise you are better off without them
---
Step 4. Thank me later
---
They're former 'Diehards', and if I recall correctly, 'Diehards' were the least violent among the five raider groups that roamed pre-Scorched Appalachia.
---
Ah. Well I cant help there. Try posting in Facebook groups, some folks like myself and my PS4 friends love building complex stuff for other people. Happy hunting wastelander!
---
The servers can barely handle everyone going through their stashes now, adding more would only make it worse!
---
I guess we'll see some updates today, they still didn't put new patch notes on the forum despite maintenance being finished 16 hours ago.
---
It's actually about 1600 levels, not 5000. But this is still insane.
---
I would love it if we got more basic emotes/communication emotes and maybe change the emote ui to one that can display more than the wheel can.
---
You're welcome bud
---
Probably - I only come across it in NW really. Thanks for clarifying!
---
the list of things that doesnt work as intended OR used to work and got "patched" and thus no longer work - is getting pretty fucking long :-( 
---
makes you wonder if even one single employee at Bethesda actually plays this game of theirs?
---
&gt; Things like mini nukes and missiles take up so much of the space, and I don't want to just drop them, and finding people to sell to is difficult. 
---
That's because few players want them. So your choice to hold onto these is a choice that is working against you. You will have to learn to let go of things so that your stash isn't a problem. 
---
Stash limits are for a reason past just game flavor. It's also tied to server stability. Unlimited stash would cause a lot of server crashes. 
---
For me, a general rule is this. Keep resources between 50-100 in count. Right now, I've also taken to bulking everything I can, save lead, steal, and wood. This way, I can keep track of all that easier, and when I have more than I need, I put it up for sale in my vending, or sell to a vendor bot. It's amazing the amount of junk I sell.
---
Games have made us hoarders for no reason other than fear something might suddenly become valuable later.
---
Also we are starting to need more budget due to them. Or make them cost a bit less and the ability to put 4 instead of 3.
---
I feel like there is a discrepancy between the amount of immersive apocalypse setting C.A.M.P items and the amount of silly player items. Not just in this pack but in the shop in general.. 
---
Is that just me being a stick in the mud?
---
NW had a ghillie thingy though, I think it was an outfit and not a skin for actual armor.
---
Reduce the player count from 24 to 20 or 18 increase the limit according to reduce players server more stable bigger stash.
---
No, I mean that when I pick up scout or wood armor when other players die it sometimes comes with a fo1st bright skin on it. I game advertising maybe?
---
Or collect ore to complete the mission. One doesn‚Äôt work without the other
---
Oh shit yea wow that a great tip lol thank you so much
---
Edit: damn they take  pure crimson flux  they still difficult to get , high radiation fluids aren‚Äôt common drops
---
Pc sorry
---
You could check out r/fallout76settlements
---
Bro this could actually be really cool and make 1h melee a great thing. It might have to be limited to 1h and not work with Unarmed for balance reasons.
---
I would so run a riot shield with security baton, Tire shield with a pipe wrench, cakepan shield with a rolling pin. It would make 1h a different way to play. Plus this would synergize well with the new legendary perk coming out that rewards you for blocking enemies in melee. Great post!
---
I wont be on for a few days but i wld trade it.
---
Took me 2 hours...... a lot of magazines but only 1 bobblehead...
---
so they have a default skin on it for NW and when you loot it it stays on? havent played NW so I dont know but sounds plausible.
---
Yes - this also happens for weapons - gold 50cals, etc. It‚Äôs impossible to blend in with bright orange stripy camouflage
---
Ask in the Wayward.
---
Eh they may have just removed you to make room for a friend so their team could still get the public benefit. But I get where you're coming from.
---
Here is a real pro tip! You can also do this with power armor drops or normal drops if you have your weapon out and hold down reload to holster it as you hit the ground. Been using it forever its great. I think the reason your "bug" works is because you unholster your weapon upon hitting the vats key.
---
So you need the eggs and not frogs themselves? If yes then you need to search for radtoads - this is the kind of frogs that you are looking for. Small frogs drops only legs i believe. You can find radtoads near school in Grafton
---
I give them out 40-50 at a time to newer players when I get to that many every couple days.
---
Every time I start getting more stims something comes along and beats my ass for like 15 of them lol
---
Doesn't matter if you are using a b2525 fixer or not, running around with less than 10 guns and a million rounds of 10 different ammo types is just bonkers :)

3\* = you have **chance** to get 3\* 2\* 1\* weapon  
---
2\* = you have **chance** to get 2\* 1\* weapon   
---
1\* = you have **chance** to get 1\* weapon   
---
Is it that hard to understand how this thing works
---
I feel like the developers dont play this game lol. Fallout 4 has some great mechanics with building (always could be improved) but they took out all the good features. I can make better structures in Ark:SE...
---
The game now is night and day from the "beta". It's definitely worth giving it another try.
---
Unfortunately, the explanation is very similar to current situations in real life.
---
"They're gone. Reduced to atoms"
---
When the meta is shit. I never stopped enjoying meta in old good MMOs.
---

---
Considering that most unbanned were not wiped clean and some of the admitted heavy dupers got reinstated even with their full inventory ...
---
I kinda get you, but I also get the ones screaming for heads to fall.
---
As it stands now, cheating does pay within FO76, and that's literally! Dupers get to keep their gains and are able to sell their shit for real money.
---
The bonkers, my sir, is my middle name: -D
---
First generation of "raiders", they have much to learn.
---
No one wants a realistic camp
---
You could check out r/fallout76settlements for building tips.
---
Unsuspended. Everyone who received a permanent ban is still banned.
---
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE BRAHMIN OUTFIT?!
---
Correct, each and every unit of fuel in my vendor is selling quickly. I guess it is expensive to craft for yourself, but never checked it.
---
You must have lived a sheltered life :)
---
Used that one for SBQ fights for quite some time. With max Rifleman it would also work fine against most other enemies.
---
It Doesn't matter if you nerf the damage. It will one shot any non event boss in the game even if it did 50 percent  instead of 100 percent. A low hp junkies build one shots anything. If it's a level 91 deathclaw make it two shots. They probably won't nerf it since it feels bad to people to see 1200 instead of 2k damage on a mob yet the mob only had 800 hp anyway lol. The only point in nerfing it is if they bring out more content. My fixer hits for 4k since it does two shots at the press of a button. Literally couldn't care if nerfed.
---
I have an AR which I put a .38 receiver on for the sole purpose of not one shotting legendaries in events. It still one shots any normal mob. The .38 receiver cuts the damage of the rifle by over 50 percent!
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
There are also PA spawns at Gorge junkyard, Morgantown trainyard and under Mama Dolce's.
---
With your spots could be that someone looted those before and I believe PA only respawns at server restart
---
My prices for Bobbleheads and Magazines may be a little out of date, due to the influx of new customers and the associated increase in demand. 
---
For the ‚Äòscrip value‚Äô legendaries, the ‚Äò100c per star‚Äô is the quick and easy ricing method, but is inaccurate. If you‚Äôre buying legendaries to scrip them, then the pricing should be judged on the scrip value, not the star count. 
---
Under that pricing model, three one-star armor pieces (300c and 9 scrip) are not equivalent to one three-star weapon (300c and 40 scrip).
---
Same difference, "bans" on FO76 are never permanent, just check the "ban waves" before this one.
---
you missed the point of this post
---
The emote system is not really set up for tactics.  Unless you're looking at the person or the person is on your public team, you may not see the emote.  You'd have to see it pop up on your screen (maybe above public team list) for everyone to get a tactical picture.
---
Mini nukes and missiles are for trash weapons. It's gone hurt to hear this, but you need to learn to stop giving garbage space in your stash. 
---
You shouldn't keep any ammo in your stash, that's what the Bandolier perk is for.
---
If it's not a legendary weapon and you aren't using it, scrap it. There is literally no reason to hold on to regular weapons. 
---
No food or water goes into the the stash. That's what Thru-Hiker is for. 
---
No excessive amounts of chems go into the stash. That's what Traveling Pharmacy is for. 
---
Really, the only things that should go into the stash are scrapped junk items (and only if you don't have a scrap box), legendary items you aren't using but have a good roll, cosmetic clothing items, trophies (comics, bobble heads etc), rare plans you want to sell, and regular junk items that are used in crafting recipes. 
---
Notes and holotapes are fine anywhere since they don't weigh anything.
---
Why does everyone want to make every weapon OP? Is the game not easy enough as it is?
---
Can we get Beth to do BugFixing first, before they get a chance to fail at rebalancing?
---
I wish i could find someone selling one, I'd trade a Raven Mask or Fixer Plan for that Knife, fits in real well with my Big Game Hunter Rifleman.
---
I know people who received a full and permanent ban. Not a suspension. They have been informed that services have been cut indefinitely. These people duped religiously every time a new was found and Karma caught up and it is deserved. My post is about how the innocent got caught up in the suspension Wave and received truly hateful comments even though they were innocent until proven guilty by the means of a permanent ban.
---
I'd always wished that the number of stars represented the  number of health bars you had to chew through to down them, and that they'd gain new attacks on with each refill of health ronutilize against you, each more aggresive and fascinating than the last.
---
Well yeah, I know, but it's kinda lame to make public team and then remove people who join because they want their friend. I mean it's public. If you want a public team benefit with friends at least fill it fully with friends.. I know I know I'm complaining, but if they just said something in the voice chat I'd leave with no problem, I didn't even need that team much, it's just a bit frustrating.
---
When I see posts like this it makes me feel like you are following an outdated online guide vs playing the game. 
---
When you leave the vault the game tells you what to do. The reworked the beginning of the game.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHmskwqCCQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHmskwqCCQ)
---
Really. I had to bust my ass for those! Man :/
---
I mean someone dropped me both Gorillas so can't complain that much.
---
No. 
---
A 3 star enemy has a chance to drop 1,2,3 stars. That‚Äôs be design. 
---
A 1 Star enemy is not as difficult, and therefore can only drop 1 Star weapons.
---
I mean there's people like me who generally only have one or two people they want to play with in party chat, I'll make room for them but generally message the person I remove saying I'm sorry and why I removed them so they don't feel like they did something wrong
---
Sadly a guy higher than my level took it all. I‚Äôm very sorry guys. But I give free things so when I post here again come right awayüòÅ
---
It eats up acid and oil, but flamers were buffed with the Wastelanders update so it's totally worth it to buy or craft. They just melt through clustered ghouls like they were never even there.
---
Notes and holotapes lag the shit out of your inventory ui. They're best dumped.
---
I just want display items to not have anything to do with the build budget.
---
If you have FO 1st you can transfer between characters by stashing stuff in suitcases at train stations on your private server. Never just drop it, but stash in the suitcase/locker/trash can etc., log out, switch characters, log in, and head for the suitcase. Sometimes it will take a second to show up if you‚Äôre too fast, though, and that‚Äôs always a bit nerve-wracking  üòÇ
---
Agreed. I hate the whole build budget, I understand it‚Äôs so you don‚Äôt overload the server but still it‚Äôs stupid.
---
Nope
---
Yeah, that's exactly my point. If only they said something xD but just removing someone feels a bit rude. Also why not just tell your friends you're about to make a team so they'd join immediately and then a random would just fill the gap, not the reverse. But yeah, no big deal really.
---
Why are you trying to keep missiles and mini nukes?
---
Anyway the limit is there due to server strain. Having unlimited storage as you are suggesting would cause incredible lag.
---
My man! I found mine at the Red Rocket by Sweetwater's.
---
I‚Äôm totally going to ignore the meta, and have fun. I get that some people like it but minmaxing just feels so robotic and generic.
---
When do servers restart?
---
If I had loaded in a couple seconds later they probably wouldnt have visited my camp. Must be my 15 luck being useful for once.
---
Nah I thought the same they give radtoad eggs. Shot a blue frog at WS and it dropped the right kind :)
---
if i can buy purified water at the vendor for 10caps i should be able to sell it for 30caps at the same vendor
---
If we are talking about stash there are 2 missing features that is tickling me since start.
---
1, separate stash. Like I put all my outfit in one so I do not have to scroll it through always.
---
2, account wide stash for easier trading (with others as well).
---
EDIT: Missile, Mini nuke, 40mm ammo has more weight than usually ammo and they barely used (maybe 40mm). In this game you have to manage the hoarding problems. It took me 2 weeks just to realise what ammo/aid should I keep.
---
They‚Äôd be an ad for some shit I don‚Äôt care about? Honestly wtf is going on with YouTube at the moment? Every video has at least 1 ad.
---
I mean generally I'm the first one on my friend group online. And playing for two or three hours before they get on, so they can't just all join at once
---
Went to buy some gold from my guy and I think I may have the same problem now -_-
---
There is a guaranteed spawn in the place where you do the power armor quest. Always spawns a couple of chassis, assuming you are on the quest.
---
Like I said, I kinda get you.
---
But I also get the other side, as there is no one to trust to actually ban the guilty, let alone keeping them banned.
---
&gt;  they were innocent until proven guilty by the means of a permanent ban
---
And therein lies the crux, a perm ban is not a guilty verdict at all. Too many false positives for both banning and unbanning.
---
When do you start that quest?
---
Yea and have even less people be able to show up to events like project paradise as a trade off? No thanks. People need to just manage their stashes.
---
They restart individually, each server has their own time but I heard something about every 8 hours.
---
I've got a copy of almost every piece of lore in the game. I never experience lag going through my inventory. 
---
But if it's a problem for you then yeah, feel free to dump. I wish Bethesda would have made that stuff go into like, a notebook that just unlocks the entries when you pick them up.
---
but now got the no region ping. What a pain
---
Not a rule, and not a title. That's a sentence. Sort of.
---
I have one for sale for 50 caps
---
I would prefer more people to a bigger stash, just be picky with what you keep. Fatmans and missile launchers suck anyway, but if you want to use them heavy ordinance I believe will make the ammo weigh less!
---
That a big assumption you‚Äôve made there buddy. I‚Äôm not following a guide at all. It‚Äôs the only one I haven‚Äôt collected naturally over 200 hours of playtime and after searching the logical location I didn‚Äôt see it. 
---
Apologies for a simple question.
---
Thanks bud, appreciated.
---
You can start it at any time. I think minimum level is 25?
---
It awards you the Excavator Armor. Forgot the name of the quest now, but it is on the south east of the map. You can find the quest name online easily.
---
You get the chassis, and then you are given the quest to build all the parts for the armor.
---
This is one of the quests you have to 'find'. It is not a main quest.
---
If you go down the Raider questline and are nice to Ra Ra during her mission, she will also retrieve a free PA for you.
---
The pool next to the white springs golf club, usually around 4-5 there, and Carleton Mine, you'll find them after you drop in the big hole past the fog crawler, theres quite a few down there but theres also radscorpions so I'd bring a set of PA. I went through the same thing trying to get rid of all the oil I picked up during Fasnacht
---
Not rare, but useless for higher levels, as it's a primary prefix.
---
I don‚Äôt really understand the question. Private servers are not persistent. You can‚Äôt keep your mule anywhere.
---
Thanks:)
---
So you started the game, went to the wayward and did that intro quest? Because that‚Äôs what it tells you to get out of the vault.
---
Again it's not about whether someone gets banned. It's about the things said even to the ones that deserved a ban. Calling for someone to cancel themselves. Calling them scum and a waste of life regardless is unnecessary within any community for the actions taken in a game. 
---
The kicker is the amount of people that received such harsh comments have been unsuspended and in the eyes of Bethesda innocent.
---
What's the point then
---
Look In the hornwright building. You should start the quest in which you have to explore the building and repair the motherlode
---
I have a furious swing speed 90% less weight fire axe, it really is a great weapon for a melee build (I won't ever run bloodied so furious is my next choice). If I could get those effects on Grognak's Axe I would be so fucking happy lol.
---
It's not that there more rare just under rate I used same set up for my bloodied cammando back Q2525 10mm auto pistol and loved it but then I found a bloodied one and Imo the damage output is way better than not having to reload as much
---
Mule = my other character, meaning I keep a lot of my legendaries on my mule over-encumbered, my question was if it is safe for this character to be super over-encumbered, atm I am 1200 over-encumbered, but someone answered my question above
---
Great tip about Gun Fu, made a big difference, thanks 
---
It also helps that I rolled a few more and got a 3* with FFR  I was using a 1 star
---
ugh I‚Äôm still on that dumb quest cuz I had to find the dead man or woman with the camera in order to get plans for said camera so I could take pictures it was a whole fiasco and stressful
---
Around 150 is my sweet spot, but I carry a whole collection of stuff. I should store all my "just in case" gear and see how low I can go.
---
 You need STYLE. You need EDGE. You need *SHEEK*.
---
Edit: ownowaitstopithurts

k
---
3 legendaries is easy, just jump to multiple fisure sites and kill the scorchbeasts, they have a high rate of being legendary. as for bobbleheads, idk but there seems to be one in every building, I seem to find half a dozen every play time just looting back rooms and such while doing quests.
---
My problem with this event is that I always go for ore, and I use shishkebab to heal npcs. I do so much that I get very little exp from ghouls and only sometimes manage to see the legendaries that spawn before they get one shot by the bloodied/sneak/stealthsuit player in the corner that has either been 1 tapping all the enemies or afk. 
---
I only do this event when I have friends online now. Rewards given should be based on participation.
---
PC? Get uBlock Origin.
---
Found a nice little spot to build a floating camp outside Palace of the winding path. There's a water tower just south of it that overlooks the palace and a good chunk of Appalachia.
---
I know what a mule is. I was curious why you meant by keeping them on your private server. There were two ways to interpret your sentence. When you are on a private or public server you can be over encumbered. But as I said before, they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúkept‚Äù anywhere. When you log out, you aren‚Äôt on the server anymore.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt take things too seriously
---
There are a few good places in the bog, nice and flat, I‚Äôve found a load of decent places on the map if you ignore looking for camps with resources.
---
Yep, maybe my bad, safe I meant what if I may lose them or wherever, but apparently after 1800 they will be destroyed if dropped
---
got weight reduction armour on as well?
---
my weapon mule is not overencumbered yet as they have 5 pieces of 20% weapon weight reduction.
---
Theirs this really nice gold course that has flat fields and it looks really nice I might build they're I haven't decided yet
---
A whinge.
---
If it has a tradable form like legendary scrip bullion. I would use it certainly.
---
Golf*
---
Nop but good ideea, I have it level 2, the most basic character you can have, and a 2x2 base in Wayward, the best place for mule characters, I don't have to fast travel anywhere
---
nope, lol. That laser is a mofo.
---
You mean if my mule will be over 1800, I will not be able to drop any items from.it anymore and transfer them to my main 250?
---
I feel this, especially since action screenshots are my thing. Sometimes it feels like swimming in molasses. :(
---
If you only need combat rifles to scrap for mods. I would just hunt high level scroched ones they can have it. The event: Line in sands, Air to air, Distant Thunder and some can spawn a lot.
---
It depends on ur needs: nice view, extract scrap materials, lake/river nearby etc etc
---
search in utube "fallout 76 camp locations" maybe u will find the best spot. 
---
and responding ur question directly: No one does but u.
---
Yeah, if your mule reach 1800 lbs capacity, all things that it drops will be destroyed (and not dropped), until it goes below 1800 lbs.
---
Depends on what you want. 
---
Do you want to incorporate an existing landmark like a train or a tower? For that, find one you like and do it. 
---
Are you looking to make sales? High end only or all types? If you‚Äôre primarily high end, the places near whitespring are popular. You can go down toward the cranberry bog, but some sever hoppers only look around whitespring. 
---
Are you looking to gather resources? Find a node. Lots of maps for that. 
---
As a universal though, unless you are doing the underground glitch, find someplace flat.
---
Nice, so I know, all legendaries 1* bham drop, makes.no sense to have them, I think I have hundreds of legendaries
---
If anyone wants my 1* legendaries, add me grahamcxx on ps4, for free or some acid, how much your heart wants
---
If you keep the mule under 1800 lbs, items wont be destroyed. So, start a second mule if you are near 1800 and you can keep hoarding ;)
---
Got a camp terminal? 
---
Check it it will tell you where to go for the camera , I think it says suspicious person
---
Thank you, I am still pretty new to the game so I don't know everything about topics like this yet, I have never used a fat man and I've only shot a missile launcher 1 time so I didn't know they were bad
---
Aye. I levelled all mine to 50 so i could get them fixer and handmade plans. Then i parked them outside the rusty pick. All have the relevant weight reduction armour on. My ammo mule is still at 850 though
---
You can get reduction armour for low levels but it's rare. Especially level 1.
---
I do not want to be forced to use PA.
---
No problem were just doing our jobs
---
Thank you, I stated I may have overlooked things, which I clearly did, my perception level irl is pretty low
---
The only thing I build is nuclear fission generator  for power cores. Some people don't like pvp I don't like building camps
---
XD I keep my collectron and Beckett in a sealed room with some instruments
---
If they were able (or more correctly, wanted, because we all know they could) give us more stash space they would, but the less space we have, the more likely people are to buy FO1st. So sadly I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely in the near future.
---
Thank you I've never used a fat man and only once used a missile launcher so I was unaware they are bad
---
This!
---
I checked the challenges today, within 5 minutes had 2 bobble heads and within 30 minutes I‚Äôd leveled up and killed 3 legendaries all between fissure prime and Big bend.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs unfortunate, because I am very unlikely to buy FO1st so it‚Äôs seems I‚Äôll have to suffer haha.
---
Thank you, I kept them because I didn't know they are bad
---
Awesome picture.
---
The fusion generator doesn‚Äôt provide power cores though.
---
Not sure if they're keeping it in but it does reward "Cursed" weapons, they deal more damage but they break easier. There's only three of them and before people complained/Bethesda delayed the event, they were pretty mediocre. Still better than what non-trader players would find normally playing the game but for example the Cursed Harpoon Gun was Bloodied, faster fire rate, reduced weight. Seems pretty good, but FFR does not work on guns with only one round per clip lol. 
---
There's also new camp items which you can find in your camp build menu already, a mounted Colossus head, a giant ass-meat pile, a little stuffed doll... Pretty neat additions imo.
---
Along with this stuff, I'm sure they'll give us some cosmetics too! Actually this is probably the most they've added for a repeatable event that isn't going away, it's like when they released the Imposter Sheepsquatch event, they're giving us stuff to grind for
---
Oh that's pretty cool. Are you on PC?
---
It isn‚Äôt forced you just use it to travel
---
Those are interesting concepts, thank you, I only kept the heavy ammo as I didn't know the weapons were bad
---
8 treasury notes.
---
Also, it drops a new prefix for weapons, "cursed" (higher damage, lower durability).
---
Thank you!
---
Could have at least killed the ghouls...
---
Bloodied, 25% faster fire rate, 25% reduced vats ap cost
---
Thanks! Yes we are.
---
I was thinking about this also, but meh, I am too attached to my main and starting a new character bleh, although you have double chance of having handmade or fixer
---
I like to think of it as they‚Äôre trying to stay true to before they left Appalachia because yes at that time they were raiders, we hear of all this bad stuff they‚Äôve done through notes and holotapes, but now I think they‚Äôre showing that they changed. But ingame it doesn‚Äôt make any sense for them to keep the name of raiders whenever it also associates them with people like the blood eagles, even though they say stuff like ‚Äúthose blood eagles are crazy, and people think we‚Äôre the enemy.‚Äù Also I hate how it‚Äôs called the crater and not just crater
---
I'm at step 4, thank you, I was unaware the weapons were bad
---
Yeah I sided with the raiders and kind of play my character as a raider and I would be fully on board if it wasn‚Äôt for the dead bodies laying around and the hanging carcasses of radstags that probably smell horrible
---
Holy cow i would love to strut around with a shield and my powerfist! Thatd be Ballin, make it happen bethy
---
I was just thinking the same thing. I have 400hrs and I am still only level 85 with loads of quests still to do.
---
Just a place to build something nice, I'm past the need for resources
---
'Raider' is a pretty broad, encompassing term, and we know that the Crater Raiders do raid, because they talk about it, about killing people for their stuff, etc.
---
Bethesda, for some reason, has been unwilling to let the Crater raiders be as evil onscreen (hence why the Raider questline doesn't involve mass pillage), but they are still perfectly willing to kill, steal and burn to get what they want.
---
Nope just a regular modded chainsaw perhaps the most under rated weapon in the game, in PvP it takes down a player in under a second
---
Sure.  Think everyone goes through a process of learning to let go of things.
---
Hey man, had the same issue. They fixed the Stanley skin issue. You can use them again!
---
So the cursed weapons come with pre-set attributes?
---
Good stuff!
---
Coupled with the Mr sandman perk üòÅ
---
I kinda wanna form vote it for the go fuck your self.
---
you just keep gaining rep (not much) from the mirelurk meat turn in
---
Talk to roxy, kill the raider, then when you hand in the quest, choose second option Appalachia has a new corpse, immediately exit the conversation, repeat.
---
Unless they changed it, yes
---
Not me but a friend is afflicted with this as well as a Beckett bug so he can not complete either Ally quest. He is abit miffed to say the least.
---
Thanks I'll keep my eye out.
---
Bruh
---
I like quack surgeon, too. Keep it on all the time. I only carry 10 stim packs so using booze helps me conserve them.
---
Stims for me, booze for my fellow wastelanders.
---
I just don‚Äôt see the need to have that part. If there‚Äôs a glitch it‚Äôs worth talking about. Up/Down votes don‚Äôt really matter.
---
That seems easy, And you can do this over and over without a delay ?
---
You always need a set of stairs that has a foundation base, if you delete this foundation you wind up not being able to edit anything. If this happens, add a set of stairs on the same platform you want to delete and have those stairs attach to a foundation on the ground. Sometimes you need to add a couple of foundations if the one you placed first wouldn‚Äôt be able to stand on its own - for example, if it‚Äôs on too high ground.
---
There‚Äôs also an issue with the stone steps. If you have stone steps against a foundation, it sometimes will not allow you to edit other pieces of flooring. When I get stuck with floors I always try removing any stone steps and if that doesn‚Äôt work, build the second set of foundation based stairs.
---
Lastly, keep in mind that you cannot mix and match flooring, so you can‚Äôt have steps attached at the base to foundation and to a floor piece. Foundation at the bottom, floor at the top is fine but foundation at the bottom and floor at the bottom is going to really jack things up...
---
Because Bethesda want you keep doing that sweet grindüòç
---
Fed76 isn‚Äôt a good tool to use for prices, why do people even use it? Half the time the prices are wrong, like this thing, that fixer? It‚Äôs worthless. It has a bad 1st 2nd and 3rd effect, nobody‚Äôs gonna use it. You might be able to sell it to a low lvl or new lvl 50 for a few thousand caps but caps are also kind of worthless ever since that dupe a few months ago
---
I see that now , I‚Äôve changed the desc just get pissed of when a post gets downvoted for no reason
---
I approve
---
Spend some time traveling around checking out areas.
---
While I disagree that its been that hard to do the challenges, I think this approach is a healthy one. Just play the game and take the awards you get from natural play. 
---
Good response.
---
Sometimes the server lags and you can accidentally press the first option, also you do get less Rep doing it this way but the rep bar does go up slowly
---
Been on furlough for 4 months. Had nothing else better to do. Although i had a headstart. One of my mules used to be my main and it's 120. Another was 31 and another was 13. Didn't take that long. kept passing the weapons and armour around after each one hit 50. Ran Westek mostly. 
---
Double xp weekend helped a lot for the last one. Went up 5 levels at line in the sand alone.
---
I found the camera already but it was just a dick trying to find the people to take it off of
---
So how long would you estimate this would take to get a full rank up ?
---
Yeah but you can‚Äôt control that. So like keeping your stash manageable, gotta let it go.
---
Or at least change the combat armor drop for completing the event to a random drop from your loot pool like in fasnacht.
---
I know its just frustrating tho that i lose karma because someone doesn‚Äôt like my post
---
The Terminal tells you where they are!  (This is more for anyone reading this later)
---
I have fallout 1st just for the scrap box. I never play on my private server. That being said im still always out of space in my stash
---
Well karma doesn‚Äôt really mean anything.
---
The gamma gun deletes a player character from the servers?
---
Dropped you a chat :) sure thing, let‚Äôs chat when you‚Äôre back
---
Hold on wait a damn minute, this is the best photo I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Got a few with faster swing speed,
---
Oh dammit i was about to join you
---
I bet you're the kind of chump who insists he should get a discount on his burger when he doesn't want all of the toppings.
---
Your not wrong
---
There's some nice spots in the mire. lots of premade campsites you can incorporate.
---
The edge of the savage divide has some of the best views. Lots of camp sized cliffs.
---
The cranberry bog is nice. 'Cept for the scorchbeasts. If you can find a quiet spot it's got lots of nice level ground.
---
You do realize that the commonwealth is hundreds of miles away, and at the time this game takes place, it will be decades before the institute is even formed? And not to mention, gen 3 synths weren‚Äôt created until recently in fallout 4 which is in the late 2200s, this game is in the early 2100s
---
you must be joking lol
---
I love to make assumptions on other people‚Äôs lives because they said a sub is nice. I love doing that /s
---
These are ammo for explosive weapons. Very few current build use them as main.
---
For ammo you should keep what you need and want to sell.
---
I have a rifle and heavy build character.  
---
I keep 0.308, 0.45, 5.56 for my rifles (they are popularly used, easy to sell)  
---
For heavy the 5mm, 0.308 and .50 are popular.
---
These were ballistic. I do not use energy ammo so I sell all fusion cell, plasma cartridges and plasma cores.
---
Most ammo goes for 1 cap for 1 bullet so it is not the best income.
---
Alt mule characters can help holding your items if you cannot decide :D
---
Yes, it does.
---
Why only PA? Why not any armour?
---
You hook it up to the thingy at poseidon. I forget the name. It grinds out 9 or 10 an hour if the workshop doesn't get attacked
---
I take it back now honestly
---
Wrong sub
---
How about they get off their asses and implement a chat system like literally 99% of online games. Emotes are nice and all, but every single communication issue would be solved with a side chat.
---
8 Treasury note man I can't get rid of the 850 I've already got lol.
---
Mentats, brain fungus soup and see if you can find an INT bobble head.  Get the supplies to craft a bunch before you pop that bobble head.
---
No idea, but they do have a camo paint for T-65 which is nice. But it overrides the mod on each piece and takes 60 flux to craft
---
Thanks this would definitely be helpful being a junkies build means I‚Äôve got way to many excess mentats
---
Your girlfriend playing Fo76 - Mission Accomplished :D
---
Armor benefits already outranks PA
---
They are more of a oooohhhh ahhhhhhhh factor really
---
I bet you‚Äôre the kind of chump who takes too much extra toppings
---
I have only heard one other person use that analogy, before. The first time, was when I was with my older sister, when she got high, for the first time.
---
You use it at power plants. It's a lot easier than powering up the whole plant to turn on the core producing chingus
---
That's why I also included the "make the game harder" part...
---
And meatweek is around the corner too... as Fasnacht, that will give notes too :)
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox swing by my camp. I‚Äôll sell you a spare if you like. Does that count as a find for score?
---
Sorry mate! Next time I‚Äôll let you know when I‚Äôm giving free things away
---
I know right! I love Red Dead 2's implementation of photomode. It's kind of ruined in Fallout 76, when you're in the moment of a good capture but just can't get there in time.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem like it, thanks though!
---
Ok thx
---
Omfg, I can't believe I missed this. This is going to be the new card in my single point of charisma
---
I‚Äôm sorry, maybe I just don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre asking but... what did you expect to happen when you ate an item?
---
where do you find this weapon and the mods? don't think I've ever seen one!
---
That's where I got most of them I grinded that event on the hour every hour for two weeks was setting me alarm during the night lol. Had legendary's and masks dropping out me pockets I kept my whole friends list in scrip for weeks lol.
---
yeah my first wendigo colossus dropped me a one star nocturnal rolling pin, at least it was level 50 and did like 25 damage, so at night it would almost double! Only cost me about 10 plasma cores and repairing my gatling gun in the middle of the fight -- oh and about 6 other guys doing the same. 
---
I put it on display.
---
I dunno just didnt expect to lose my stuff when I want to use it
---
Guy says his friends all duped but he "earned" his equips....
---
Guy goes on a triggered rant...
---
Guy compares obtaining weapons in the early months of the game to getting dupped equips from friends....
---
Guy is still trash.
---
Sorry that sounds really confusing when you write it out. If you‚Äôre on Xbox message me your gamer tag and I‚Äôll team to help remove it if you‚Äôre still stuck üôÇ
---
They should've been called Scavengers or something akin to that.
---
You may be surprised to know that I do in fact know that it can be used to power a multitude of things....
---
Something you may not know though is that you can place a fusion generator on a spring trap. Wire it up and trigger the trap and the generator disappears until you fix the trap - it still provides power, cannot be damaged and doesn‚Äôt attract monsters
---
Check Yabs guide, Google F76 junkies build. Very informative
---
I revive whenever I see a downed player, I've got over 700 stims might as well use em lol as well as that, during queens it *always* spawns you in the Nuke zone miles away so it saves time and potentially death by rads
---
Nope. Used it to track one down.
---
Yeah, same for me. I am sitting on 300 legendary modules too... I had to spend those scrips on something, lol :) Maybe the fall or winter season when the BoS come back, I can spend them on something nice.
---
Only downside is it sometimes snaps to a legendary enemy and you just pull the trigger without thinking and then the people in your party are like 'look at this wanker one shotting legendary enemies and not giving the little people a chance to get a hit. BOOOOO!'
---
Tried that. It does not.
---
Great shots
---
This still doesn‚Äôt make it even near as good as normal armor
---
No problem. I think I‚Äôm just going to have to accept I won‚Äôt get the 500pts for this challenge today.
---
yes i have the double bundle, i have checked so its installed, i have restarted the game 3 times and i have restarted my console twise, bit i still couldnt find any of the skins in either the crafting stations or in the atom shop....
---
Right?!?!
---
Four fizzures, 0 leges. Golf course, 0 leges. Burrows, 0 leges. Steakhouse, 0 leges. West Tek, 0 leges.
---
And all had high level mobs spawned. I was just about giving up when Uranium fever popped and saved me.
---
If your on Xbox I have quite I bit of 38
---
Thank you, random citizen!
---
Found 3 at whitesprings area after equipping perk for challenge üòÇ. The twonging sound wouldn't let up.
---
Just converted myself and still learning but going well so far
---
Are you wanting to place a blueprinted camp or build a new one?
---
same here, i just like helping other players, GT: Packtray
---
i don't play any specific build, other than using heavy
---
Well, blame the people that keep duping so they can sell their duped items on Ebay for like 100 bucks a pop and the people who justify it as legit because bethesda bad.
---
That's awesome!
---
Wow. Best picture I've seen so far. The Monet of Appalachia is what that is. Well done and do you have a gallery?
---
I took the Red Rocket workshop and the first defend the workshop was 3 Scorchbeast, two legendary. Good times.
---
Same found one for me and my friend. Had to turn up the sound on my headphones.
---
The audio it plays is a subtle bobblehead type boing noise similar to a spring.
---
Places I would suggest are the lighthouse related to the mothman event (in one of the windows.) The giant teapot house next to the base of the toilet. Or in the upstairs bedroom on the table next to the wall at Silva Homestead. Hope this helps üëç
---
Just a quick question about the R91 skin.
---
I've only seen that Screamin' Eagle R91 skin, are you talking about another one? Because that skin was already out, I think it was part of the Flyboy bundle.
---
wait, strong back's bad? in what way? i have considered using it but just hadn't gotten around to it
---
Meanwhile I just play the game to blow some ghoul heads off
---
I am blaming them. I‚Äôm also blaming the people who keep saying duping doesn‚Äôt hurt the game. 
---
Everyone that dupes, buys dupes or has no issue with dupes are to blame.
---
I recently got below 400 with 5 pieces of WWR. Lowest I have been in months.
---
make sure to have a display case with one bone saw in it that Ward will have you hunt down rather than use the other 142 that they have in the back
---
Build a new one the blueprinted ones never work that's why I dont bother with them
---
Yeah I realized that, I also realized that this is some kind of bug but I found it very funny so I posted it... this is not falloutlore anyway üòÇ
---
That the correct explanation! Bravo!
---
Nope. The weight thing was to help with mule duppers. I think it is the right thing personally. 
---
Not to mention there are enough train stations around that you can get to them within a few minutes. Or go to the closest player vendor and scrap some stuff. At a certain point you really don‚Äôt need that 30 caps for your assault rifle, or if you have space, store that 1* Gatling gun in your stash and get it back out when you get to a train station.
---
there should be a legendary 'fix it good' perk to fix the game
---
Ha ha! Spot on!
---
Absolutely there is alot of new and improved and wonderful bugs to experience! And majority of the old familiar to you bugs are still around.
---
Lool you are asking for too much now
---
You‚Äôre delightful!
---
Same didn't have room to buy anything of mumbles so I just kept buying modules scrip back to max more modules waiting for the g shotgun to be fixed before I make any
---
youre 100% right but without dupers you will never get your b2525 fixer or explosive gatling plasma.
---
duping is cheating and cheating is not fair thats right.
---
but with this horrible rng in this game maybe a hand full of people would get a god tier weapon legit by grinding the game.
---
Yeah, she regens pretty quickly if she's left alone for a little while. That makes it a real pain when she aggros something in the nuke zone and you have to draw her back out again. Good luck for your next run!
---
For the bobblehead check Alpine River Cabins in the largest building underneath a bed. I saw another post about how there is a guaranteed spawn. I went and lo and behold a bobble head.
---
But if it were a case of needing to bind it to user account, they already do that with various items you can earn in game.
---
It's a new thing, they probably want to get a few styles of prefabs out there. Same with the wallpapers and how a bunch were popping up when that feature was added. I'm sure we'll get some new building sets eventually.
---
I disagree. I complete my daily and weekly challenges sometimes without even paying attention. Legendary enemies are random but they spawn at various locations without even needing to be in an event. Most of the challenges we do daily without even noticing.
---
i will admit that i didn't revive the level 19 that showed up to the SBQ event last night and went down like a French prizefighter every ten seconds though
---
So your turn off other players stuff but complain when they do it to you??? LMAO
---
Yeah. The game has to have some survival management.
---
Yes, the game has gotten MUCH better, and will receive a level scaling update soon!
---
That sounds like something a Synth would say
---
Pick addictions that either you don't mind the downside of, and especially pick chems you'll use most often.
---
I think it's that the people who buy Atoms eat this stuff up, while the people who like their realistic apocalypse camps tend to save up Atoms playing the game.
---
So if i keep the raider alive can i still do the glitch
---
One of my favorite places for camping when I want a clear area is right on the shore by Silva homestead. Love that water view üôÇ There‚Äôs also a traveling merchant there and you can loot the farm when you need supplies.
---
While I dont support duping I cant help to wonder what's stopping Bethesda from fixing the game... That's a great way to solve Dupe related issues.
---
They also lock those items so you dont loot the vault on a few characters and just transfer all your end game blueprints to one character enabling you to skip months of ~~endgame~~ grind.
---
Yeah. Is really good because it's super quick.
---
That's my point. More and more are being put into the game this way.
---
When the game started, the reward from Mayor for the Day was All Rise. And it was tradable. In fact just about everything was tradable. That was the idea. You fight the SBQ, and after try and trade with other players for the plans you wanted. 
---
That seems to be going away.
---
I think it's gonna be a stash box, probably why they chose that car. Small, and the top opens up, works perfect.
---
Would be nice if we got some vehicles to decorate with though
---
Thanks, I thought I executed them or something. üòÇ
---
No start the quest, kill the former raider, then go and hand it in, click second option, (Appalachia has a new corpse) immediately exit the conversation after pressing the second option then re start the conversation with her and repeat
---
You don't need a god tier weapon. I can kill anything with a 1* lever. Blaming the rng is such a bullshit excuse too. Go grind BIS gear in WoW classic then tell me this game's loot is harsh.
---
it's a numbers game.
---
You'll hit more legendary enemies than you will SBQ's, and since it appears the difficulty of the enemy has only a passing relation to the quality of the drops; then by the odds, you will get more valuable items from random legendaries than SBQs.
---
so youre telling me the rng is ‚Äûbalanced‚Äú in this game..?
---
Ah well shit i let him go to foundation,
---
You can sell 30 stacks of items per machine. CAMPs with 200+ plans have multiples of the same plan‚Äîmore often than not it‚Äôs stacks of mounted heads from duped Holiday Gifts.
---
Got so pissed at the Uranium Fever event the other day bc this guy would one shot kill the legendary and then salute the angry emotes.  Some people had really shitty parents.
---
you can build up to 4 vending machines, and can sell as many items as you want but can only sell 30 KINDS of items in each one.
---
for example, one can have 400 units of 30 kinds of ammo, another can have 5 each of 30 different weapons, etc.
---
Another plus side. Liquor is easier to craft than stimpak. üòÇ
---
The fixer is the better gun for sure.  One thing to consider though is ammo.  If you have the armco ammo machine and set it to 5.56, it will make ammo at the same rate if not faster than you will use it in most cases.  I ended up stashing my bloodied fixer and switching to my bloodied handmade when I figured this out.  
---
Used to need to craft .45 every few hours for the fixer.  I haven't had to do that once in 3 weeks now after switching guns and I have 4500 something 5.56 right now.  When I made the switch I started with 1200 so the machine is definitely outpacing me.
---
I ended up building at the white spring gold course,I found a nice flat area and then theirs alot of buildings near by that always have a bunch of loot in it, the only issue I really have now is I'm trying to light the place up, I own the fusion core generator but im trying to find a way to light the whole place up without it lookin like shit from all the wires everywhere, I'm up for suggestions
---
Are you searching on a private server? You‚Äôll almost never find one there. 
---
When you enter an area where a bobble head can spawn, there‚Äôs only a small chance that it actually will. In public servers where player traffic is high, you‚Äôre much more likely to find one that another player spawned while moving through the area
---
If your going bloody a tse wont help you.
---
The hardest part wasnt lining then up together, but centering then with the room, it's hard to judge when you can only move one at a time. Still, was easier than expected. In very happy with the turnout.
---
Thank you, this makes a lot of sense
---
I had trouble too. First time ever trying the perk card. Seems the audible bobblehead rattling sound only picks up if you're like 10 feet from one. It got to the point where my spouse had to log on and drag by sorry butt to a spawn location.
---
I don't need that. My second make of a plasma caster was just that B2525. And it's a great weapon even though I'm not a bloodied. 
---
People's perspective of random is always going to be skewed. You remember the times you didn't get what you wanted more than the times you do. You see it all the time in table RPGs.
---
Computer based random number generators aren't the best. At the same time, if you study data patterns, more often you see streaks. True random only happen over a large sample. 
---
But the thing is this. You don't need that B2525 fixer to play the game. I find players that feel they need that to be able to the game, are trying to remove all risk and challenge from the game. Which makes me wonder why they play if little is a challenge or risk.
---
Until I see my one star rolling pin, then I use the puke emote
---
I read up on duping from a few game programers. I suggest doing some research to find out why it's hard to fix.
---
I suggest that because I can‚Äôt do a decent explanation of why.
---
It‚Äôs also a very wide spread problem for many video games, even ones like Animal Crossing.
---
oh LAWD i was thinking that last night as i hunted around random places until i found one at the bed and breakfast behind INACCESSIBLE that i could not get to
---
good times, good times
---
This picture is dope!
---
Why not inject them with F.e.v
---
Will do!
---
If you're on XBOX, I might have a few items for you.
---
The Screaming Eagle skin that was in the Flyboy bundle is one of three variants of it, the other two variants have different textures for the stock and foregrip (one is wood, the other is matching bakelite) and so far those two variants haven't been released. There's also a separate R91 skin in the files, which is also for the Handmade, and is far more polished than the Screaming Eagle (no animation issues and it actually has iron sights available). I'm excited for that one because I've always loved the R91 due to owning a CETME model C irl. Shame I won't be able to chamber it for .308 rounds though.
---
[You can see the R91 skin in action here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpZhMjCVQcw), and [you can also see the wood furniture variant of the Screaming Eagle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKFfxNjp9wA) on the same channel.
---
I found it randomly in the bog before even knowing about the glitch
---
At one point you get so many stimpak might ass well use it for the good fight
---
Is it true the colossus event is for 8 people only?
---
Keep your power conduits on the roof and you should be fine.
---
Tanagra town for acid and lucky hole mine for lead
---
Use this to find the components you need

---
Ah ok do you know a place for steel ?
---
Thanks
---
FO4 only had 1 star legendaries.
---
Have you tried treetops?
---
Kill a load of mutants and mole miners and scrap everything.  Works best with the scrapper perk
---
Oh wow, I didn't know about those, thanks! I'm gonna have to get them
---
Although I gotta be honest, I want that Vertibird rotor jetpack more than the guns lol
---
Wish there was a feature where we could download other players pictures to use as our own loading screens.
---
Damn those running turds. Charred ghouls irk me.
---
Ps how do you post a picture in your post?
---
Damage prefixes are prioritized by players because we want to overkill things even more. Quad is useful on a very small number of weapons, such as the Broadsider, harpoon gun, and Tesla.
---
Run westek with the scrapper perk and pick up everything, weapons off dead enemies, junk off the floor, everything I usually walk out with 500 -700 steel
---
Plans of the same kind will stack in the vending machine so long as they are listed at the same price
---
With the Holiday Gift-a-palooza that went on not so long ago folks are potentially sitting on hundreds of mounted, armor and weapon plans. So if you see someone selling 200x mounted ticks, this is why
---
Looool. Might as well. Nah, they usually just quit messing around when they see one because one or two shots in their high rads build will kill them.
---
thanks for all the info, any forums or videos where you share info?
---
Welcome to the junkie life! (Snorts a line of buffout).
---
The coolest thing with a Junkies build is that...there really is no "Junkies build."  Unlike with bloodied where you have to run Nerd Rage, Dodgy, Serendipity, Adrenal Reaction mutation, and walking around with 10% health, etc... with Junkies, you don't need a single SPECIAL perk to get the most out of your build.  
---
Once you're addicted to five drugs of your choosing (there are some really good breakdowns of what drugs have what negative effects), and that's it.  You're officially a Junkie and getting your 50% damage boost.
---
You're now full-health so you don't have to worry about being one-shotted by a ghoul you missed while taking WhiteSpring or a cricket you didn't see during a queen fight.  And if you run Vanguard, you're really tanky.
---
I run a commando stealth junkies character with a J2525 fixer and it's a lot more fun than my bloodied commando character, simply because I don't have to worry about dying all the time.  I also run a heavy Junkies character with a JE90 50 &amp; LMG and I just destroy everything. Barrels of fun.  
---
I would recommend running a metric butt-ton (that's a lot) of mutations to make up for all the negative effects of withdrawal symptoms from being addicted.  Your perception, intelligence, and agility might be pretty low. Bird Bones, Eagle Eyes, &amp; Egghead for sure.  Also speed demon, marsupial, and herbivore/carnivore as quality of life mutations that every one should be using on every character.
---
No. I did not. I have not once been to the wayward. Never said that I had.
---
Ah ok thanks I‚Äôll head over there noe
---
I'll usually do 5 or 6 dailies and doesn't take that much effort or going out of the way. I don't need to do them all. I'm not gonna spend my play session going out of my way hunting 3 legendaries or a bobblehead. I wanna do my own thing too.
---
I got a 1* quad pump shotgun out of SBQ and I can't tell you the horrendous amount of fun I'm having in places like Charleston Capitol, Fort Defiance, Lucky Hole Mine. Boomboomboomboomboomboom non-stop. I wish it was a secondary stat, imagine it combined with Furious!
---
I see what you did there
---
UK plugs
---
I think I'll let go of this Daily challenge after I got the chicken coop. I hope they include the chicken sound.
---
Cry baby
---
Awesome shots. Love how you can see the bullets flying off in some of them. Do you use photomode or the prosnap camera?
---
Yea don't share or reuse needles.
---
You'd be better off with a bloody explosive rifle then a tse bloody gives you better damage then two shot with way better accuracy!
---
I really only ever claim the workshops for the Score challenges. Might be handy if you need to farm something, but with the challenges happening now, I'm not sure how long it would be before someone else tried to claim it, and I'm not about to go PvP over one. Once you claim one, you'll get one or two extra events pop up for you later to defend the workshop, but it's more of the same, mobs that spawn on the outer edges and (are supposed to) head in and attack the structures. But sometimes you have to go hunt them down because they got stuck somewhere. If you check your map during the waves, it shows diamonds for their locations, which helps you see how many are left and to track down the stragglers.
---
The mob types are random, too. At the dirt track, I've seen dogs, wolves (? Maybe), mixed robots (liberators, eyebots, and protectrons), and scorched, that I can think of. 
---
Oh, and keep an eye out for the Leader of the Pack event at the fairgrounds by the racetrack! It will get you the "Kill 3 Legendary Enemies" score challenge in one go. There's 3 wolf packs with a one-star alpha in each pack. Check the map for locations and make sure you kill the third one last, or the event will end early. The ones in the forest are easy to lose the bodies in the grass, so try to be close to the leader before you pop him so you don't lose him if you want the one-star loot. Also sometimes the event appears to start again, just as you've killed the last one, and there will be a fourth task to kill the wolf horde leader. I want to say sometimes he's not a legendary, though? The horde bunch is in motion, too, so you may want to watch the map a sec and see which way they're going, so you can fast travel to somewhere ahead of them and close the distance faster.
---
I'm on XB1, I can help with some camp stuff. I know a good majority if the plans. Just need you to give me a general idea of what you want it to look like. I wont charge anything aside from the resources I'd need to build everything and maybe some lead or ammo if you can spare it.
---
The coop is all I want anyway. Everything after that holds zero value for me.
---
No, I'm saying it's a shit excuse for duping. What would you call balanced? I use WoW as an example because they have set loot pools but people still have to do hundreds, if not thousands, of arena runs for a belt. If you just hand endgame shit out to people then what endgame is left?
---
A build I don‚Äôt have to commit to... *scratches arm obsessively*. Junkies definitely sounds like the way for me! Thank you for the in-depth response, it is very much appreciated. Do you have any suggestions on what chems to OD on for a sneaky sniper?
---
Working a game bug, but wanting a game bug fixed?
---
I usually read thru the terminals but sometimes I get lazy so many I read one on where to find them  but probably sped thru it lol
---
It‚Äôs the camp terminal you can build in your ...camp
---
I won‚Äôt use a rifle without the Quad prefix, preferably with FFR.....feels like I‚Äôm playing with a chainsaw, it rips through mobs like no one‚Äôs business.
---
I see the same pattern. But it's not the duping... well it is... but it isn't.
---
It's that they can't stop the duping.
---
Glitches and exploits are so prevalent. Maybe it's just a problem with priorities or maybe it's spaghetti code that makes it impossible. Doesn't matter, as the end result is the same. 
---
Wipe the duped stuff, it comes back. Disable bot vendors or display cases or artillery boxes, another exploit comes around. Or an old one resurfaces. Ban dupers, they buy new accounts. 
---
I think it comes down to the game code being a hot mess. Limits their options.
---
It does include the chicken sound. It's really cute.
---
Oh oh I‚Äôm stupid my bad I haven‚Äôt built a terminal yet haven‚Äôt even been on the games in months lol
---
It's a lot bigger of an undertaking to change buff other builds to match bloodied power level AND buff pve to match it than nerf the elements that make bloodied's defense way too great and risk-free, plus you risk screwing with the NPE big time by just upping the ceiling at the endgame.
---
There is no "wrong" way to play the game if you're having fun doing it
---
That said there are resources to help you refine your toon to be optimized towards one thing or another. YT is fine for ideas, but I've also found build planners such as [Nukes &amp; Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to be essential for a streamlined build plan as I level up. The build is sharable as a link once you've selected your stats, cards, etc. for others to give advice if you so choose.
---
As an example, this is the [Bloodied Command / Team build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f345db&amp;d=sg2s01eu0eh1pi2pp2ph2pg2p01pq0la2lu2lt2l71ir2ib1a30a00a12an2ar0ao0a51a70ce0c62&amp;m=051c249fb3&amp;n=Bloodied%20Commando%20%2F%20Team) that I'm currently using. With SCORE being a thing I've opted to always be on a team and try to maximize my INT to get as much XP as I can, as fast as I can. (Unyielding armor, BE Handmade build)
---
Again, there is no wrong way to play if you're having fun!
---
I found a better way to be done with the dailies 
---
Ghost of Tsushima
---
I do it with the change view (v) button
---
I wish you can just scrap them for modules
---
Its not even that hard.
---
I do them while doing normal exploring
---
Hahaha!! You're more than welcome, friend :)
---
Explosive bait the shit outta them. They get what they deserve
---
... too late
---
That looks amazing 
---
Good job OP
---
Nuke the base and come back a day or 2 later and do it again
---
If you‚Äôre on pc, hit me up.
---
If your on ps4 i got a nice bloodied 10mm sub i could part ways with.
---
He had me locked in a room below his camp. I couldn‚Äôt throw anything out and couldn‚Äôt fast travel. I‚Äôll  keep that in mind for future pricks tho
---
I run with this on a lot along with the magazine and cap stash ones. These things are every where. I must of found about 10 of them yesterday.
---
Sure thing. I'll have to look at what my addictions are later today when I hope online.
---
Here's a list of all the chems in 76 and their withdrawal effects.  
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction
---
Amazing, thank you
---
Some thing like this should be a legendary perk. Not most of the garbage they came up with.
---
I'm on xbox, and I appreciate the offer to help out but I like the feeling of accomplishment after a hard grind, thanks again tho
---
Yes.
---
Like I said the first time I'm actually trying a real build so I'm still kind of learning, thanks for the info
---
I mean, they did stretch when making some of the in game factions already... The pre existing WV BOS were all normal people till they heard the Actual BOS on the radio right? Poof now these civvies have BOS uniforms... If I remember correctly the excuse for supermutants was quite a stretch. Meh at this point why not throw in synths.
---
I wouldnt be suprised if they used the same logic as the other factors "yea well they where seperately developed here too" or tied them to the Institutes establishment.
---
OK not much to do but delete the 10mb file called "raiders and settlers content bundle" and download it again from the store. Although I'm already guessing you have tried that too, it's all I can suggest. Well you could also submit a ticket... but you got more chance of flying to the moon and back on a twinkie than get a response.
---
Hope you get one though and it's sorted out soon. Best of luck
---
Thank you so much! Yes my gallery is here: [https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery)
---
Did you start before wastelanders? Because again, it would tell you exactly where to go when you exited the vault. 
---
If you started after wastelanders the first thing it tells you to do is talk to those two people and then go to the wayward. 
---
What were you doing for 200 hours and not paying attention to the initial quest it gives you when you leave the vault? Do you see why I would be confused as the game tells you exactly where to go? How did you end up avoiding that? It seems the only way you could avoid it is by following a guide and ignoring the in game prompts. It‚Äôs the holotape that kicks off the main questline...
---
If it was x2 junk from scrapping nything I would be down for it.
---
I also want a straight exp increase. None of this +4 INT stuff.
---
I guess "wrong way to play" was the incorrect way to put it, more disappointed with how much more I had to grind, granted I do like the hard grind, but thinking about how much further I could be with the correct build is kind of disappointing
---
Wow, anyone reading this thread. I implore you to go to this guy's profile. His photos on that are even better than one above. Bravo. That nowhere to run photo might be stolen for my desktop üëç
---
It seems to be a common misconception on reddit that junkies take drugs. Not true.
---
Once you're addicted, there's no need to take the drugs anymore. It will temporarily get rid of the negative effects of addiction but those effects are so minimal...
---
Decide what drug(s) you're gonna take on a regular basis. And get addicted to five OTHER drugs. Cause you can't have more than five addictions. You'll be free to take as much of your preferred chems as you want with impunity.
---
Because this sub has disabled image posts and pics within normal posts, the only way to do it is: 1. Upload to Imgur 2. Copy the Imgur link (I use the hidden link) 3. Paste the link in the body of your post here.
---
Well, as of now there is no real end game.  These are things they have needed to work on literally since launch.  It might be easier to nerf bloodied, but what's best for the game is to add actual content worth being well geared over, other than SBQ.
---
Or you know, text chat.
---
Many thanks!
---
It‚Äôs included in both
---
RNG sucks that's why duping  is so bad in this game.  If Bethesda would simply implement 3 star drops a 3 star etc... it would make things do much better.  Doesn't matter now since we've lost over half our player base.
---
Wow. Thank you very much. If you would like to see more you can check out my gallery here: [https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery)
---
As someone who loves to use photo mode and take cool shots - it‚Äôs annoying AF and it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me.
---
This is what I mean! Thank you!
---
I play 3rd person most of the time, just so my PA arm and heavy weapon don't take up 60% of my screen. If i remember correctly, 3rd person in fo4 felt like ass, like there was some input delay and a wide turning radius or something. It definitely feels a lot better in this game
---
LOL! Yes I agree. xD
---
Well said. Happy grind!
---
Yeah man I totally get your point, I just wanted to know if I‚Äôd missed something or if it was a bug and thought it was going to be pretty straightforward. My man above answered with 3 words.
---
But in all honesty starting out is a blur. I likely wandered off and got distracted by something in the horizon and missed it.
---
Edit - spelling
---
Not yet
---
Which can't happen if there's only one obvious build to go for
---
That would be nice. You can on PC if you drop the image into the folder that contains the screenshots.
---
Are you on a PC?
---
Yes it's been broken for a long time. I just imagine that my character had some kind of accident, and got burned but isn't afraid to hide the burn scar.
---
They can't win wih challenges and the community.
---
Harvest 10 fungi.......boo....so easy Betheada.  I'm done playing in like 5 minutes
---
Kill 3 Legendary........boo. so hard Bethesda. I don't have more than 5 minutes.
---
Just unwinnable.
---
Why couldn't you fast travel?
---
This could be a Heavy metal album cover. Awesome pic!
---
Thank you! I hardly ever use the ProSnap except for challenges etc.
---
This is the right answer. Almost like you have a responsibility to other vault dwellers. When life gives you lemons, drop a nuke.
---
Ya, wishful thinking at best.
---
I don‚Äôt think people‚Äôs stash boxes could handle it
---
That's so cool. I feel so excited to do my dailies nowüòÑ
---
How did you do the all of the main quests without first doing that?
---
Finally found one at the big bottle, thanks!
---
They aren‚Äôt hard, but by beefing them up it does make it tougher to have a 1-2 hour play session and do anything other than the challenges. 
---
Thankfully, my buddy and I both have private servers so we don‚Äôt have to compete for resources. I can do monster mash and get 3 legendaries by myself in one event.
---
So we can get them done without much difficulty, but then limits ability to just wander around, do random dailies for scrip, etc
---
Literally everywhere for steel. Grab weapons, put on scrapper perk and scrap weapons and armor.
---
I am never in the situation to revive ppl. I wish I was. I want to help and get the achievement
---
Thank you soooo much! That put a big smile on my face. Glad that people enjoy them.
---
Found one at sweetwaters house in thr bathroom. The one in the mothmans lighthouse window seems to spawn often too.
---
amen!
---
I‚Äôm not sure. As soon as I fell into the room I was taking damage constantly. It was draining the health bar super slow, I couldn‚Äôt see anything that was hurting me. I never looked down so maybe he had spiked boards all over the floor? Not sure.
---
Yes I am.
---
Aren‚Äôt the consoles backwards compatible?
---
Bashing counts, grenades count. throwing knives count. basically as long as the weapon is in your hands it counts.
---
Rock on! Thank you!
---
I like it! Do you have Fallout 1st? What building set has these white walls?
---
I love the idea but wouldn‚Äôt he just server hop when he saw where the blast zone is?
---
im not sure. I don't really know anything about the new consoles
---
Shhh
---
And vatsing creatures is not a bug
---

---
Im a big ass nerd and love the idea of metas I'm any game. I like to feel like a god.
---
That being said I can solo literally everything in this game. If he is really a super meta player he should be able to do that as well anyways or he isn't ready for meta stuff 
---
Took me hundreds of hours of grinding to get the build I have now and that was all on me. It's nice for my buddies who don't do that tho, in the really hard stuff I can pull out my junkies fully modded out gauss minigun and turn pretty much everything into mulch. Never let others dictate how you play because some people find all their enjoyment selling and building houses. It's a game younhabe your fun and I'll have my fun blowing up the countryside
---
Don‚Äôt bother going anywhere for acid. Get yourself and friends together with blowfly barrels for your syringers and build yourself a ‚Äúblowfly death arena‚Äù (fertiliser resource e.g cow and area enclosed on all sides by walls)
---
My understanding is they should be able to play 76. Haven‚Äôt heard anything an upgraded version or anything like that.
---
Oh, probably Pungi boards then
---
Yes I'm on xbox, are you online?
---
Doesn't photo mode already do this to a degree though?  Even without the noclip, the fly would be useful and it's in the game.
---
Do you have another site you use for value estimates?   It seemed high to me for this weapon too, which is why I mentioned results determine real value.
---
Was there a cap dupe?   I noticed that prices collapsed on legendaries, but thought it was more due to Wastelander products being out (plasma weapons, SS armor, etc.).
---
Xbox, but thanks!
---
Awesome!  I am so happy you found one!  :)
---
Probably yes, shortly after they re-release Skyrim.
---
Vatsing grenades is an exploit though, we can probably agree
---
The biggest down side with quack surgeon is it provides almost no health. So they are revived but barely alive. It‚Äôs a fun card, you can run it with EMT for an extra boost, and share Revenant if you expect to be reviving players a lot (Encryptid, SBQ).
---
Yeah it seems the best pictures with best lighting and textures are from
---
PC. PS4 here.
---
I love taking photos.
---
Yes! More to keep in mind ;)
---
I'm not on right now. I'll be on this afternoon. GT jss125. Add me and I'll let you know when I get on
---
Don't have Fallout 1st ... they where in the atom shop a while back and should return one day
---
I‚Äôm doing it to get the quest outta the way. And I try to stay away from glitches like that. I‚Äôll just join the events when someone else does them
---
Thats genius !
---
There is always the next build to look forward to! As you scavenge the wastelands you'll inevitably find weapons/armor/items that don't suit your current build, but could be fun on another build. Save them so that when you're ready to make a new toon you have gear at the ready.
---
I've built 7x toons across 2 accounts because for me trying out new combos of things is fun. I did pay attention to story line on the first one, but since then have found ways to level up fairly quickly so that I can get into the more fun aspects of each build and minimize the level grind. Wound up launching two new toons over the double XP weekend and got them to level 103 and 72 over the 4 day period (16-18 total hours of gameplay).
---
Have fun out there!
---
Took both factions up to the raid 79 point, this is when you have to choose a side. Chose foundation and gave them half bullion as promised, nothing to the raiders. Both factions rep were running pretty close to side by side after this. Did all dailies for them both and maxed out each faction about 3 days apart. The arguments to choose one side vs the other before both being ready to raid 79 makes little sense to me, it changes nothing about how you are perceived by the factions, but it does cut you off from valuable rep quests from one side. It also costs you scrip rewards and exp for doing the quest missions. The dailies tick off tiny amounts of rep, the faction quests award much more. Each next level up for rep is double the previous one, last two being 6000 and 12K rep pts, just in case you thought maxing rep would move as quickly as the first couple levels. Dailies reward 250 pts, you aren‚Äôt going to easily max the faction you quit on early in quest mode. A free Chinese armor plan is better than paying 4000 bullion for it. You aren‚Äôt getting access to the two gauss plans or ammo maker from either faction until you max rep with them.
---
What are ya tellin me, you want more than 4 FPS?
---
I am Level 75
---
There‚Äôs no wrong way to eat a Reese‚Äôs. You don‚Äôt need to min max to have fun
---
Can‚Äôt take credit for the idea - two blow flies appearing every time you kill something shot with that special gun is a very useful mechanic though (even the blow flies....get that chain reaction going)
---
Gotta be crafty. Do it during a major event hea attending so hes distracted
---
Encryptid is a good one. Clear the silo so its ready to nuke. Ft out, trigger encryptid than lay in wait.
---
That does seem good
---
I‚Äôve left the idea to craft smth good after spending 100 modules. 
---
1* unyielding was all what I got from this annoying process. 
---
Better Bethesda add ‚Äúgold‚Äù modification with Jetpack to my Marine *** chest
---
Big up the 1st members üòÇ
---
Maybe. I‚Äôm not sure tbh.
---
I just don‚Äôt want more people hiding in Morgantown high school with me.
---
I'm no lore master but I'll go along with this..
---
*One crude prototype synth emerges from the depths of VTU, it just wants a place to belong.. So he starts to build more synths, slowly improving thier design, testing different variations. This didnt go well, eventualy tensions brake out between poorly designed aggressive synth and the people of Appalachia leading the initial synth to flee...*
---
*The synth traveled to CIT to find the scientist who was working in collaboration with VTU in hope he could develop another synth that was like himself.... Resume cannon lore, CIT further refined synths and used them as slaves.*
---
EDIT: DiMA and his poor struggling memory.. cant quite recall his ventures from WVU. Valentine and DiMA where like brothers, because Valentine was designed to be, he is the synth constructed by the CIT scientist based on the original synths (DiMA) request for companionship.
---
I would totally love a group like that. We can only dream though.
---
Public team?
---
It completes if a teammate does it.
---
You're more than welcome to bow out - But come on, too difficult? That's honestly pretty pathetic. The challenges right now are terribly easy. Killing three legendaries is the equivalent of running 'Leader of the Pack' or 'Uranium Fever' once. I'll admit it's definitely easier to do without competition from other players, but it's still far from difficult. xD
---
Hey know i am a bit late but are you at any chance still giving away some of those outfits ? Ive seen it and really like it but cant find another way to get it. I would very appreaciate it =)
---
Ign JohnFoley
---
You're going crazy. Fallout 4 only had one star legendaries.
---
I'm on a party tonight, how about tomorrow?
---
Oh damn I wasn't even talking about that spot
---
I don‚Äôt repair armour or weapons in workshop using repair kits only.  But I still have them enough)
---
You don't remember right. Fallout 4 didn't have 2 or 3 star legendaries.
---
I think the issue is that people agreeing and disagreeing are not putting it into a time box, as well as benefits of 1st, i‚Äôm sure there could be some differences based on platform too.
---
The challenges aren‚Äôt hard, but someone who only has a couple of hours to play is in a different position to someone with 4 hours, or 6 hours.
---
Getting 3 levels in 2 hours can be difficult, sure some people say just make a new character, but this assumes you have empty character slots.
---
If you log on at prime time for playing, it‚Äôs going to be a different experience hunting things down than if you log on off peak. There is a very different style of player when you log on at 6 pm vs 1 pm.
---
And even if you can get them done in a couple of hours, that doesn‚Äôt really leave much time to  do anything else you want to do. Building a camp can take hours, unless there‚Äôs a camp challenge, you won‚Äôt be able to work on your camp in a 2 hour play session.
---
Now personally, i‚Äôm fine with it as is. I have no problem playing for longer sessions if i want to. I also realize i don‚Äôt need to have everything in the run (though i will, given my progress anyways, and i know i‚Äôll be playing more with meat week and upcoming events), but i can at least sympathize with more casual players
---
Some challenges have been beefed up and to be honest they are kinda boring. I actually miss the camera challenges at this point
---
I never have issues with ammo, i habe f1st and in around 1h i can make ~10k ammo 5.56 or 45, this is one major advantage that i will never give up my subscription, I am using the "collect 200 junk then server hop" for lead and steel
---
This, and three spawn points at Poseidon.
---
Ur welcome!
---
Fallout 4 only had one star legendaries.
---
The reason the camera mode moves slow is long ago, people figured out how to use it to scout ahead in Nuclear Winter/Survival Mode to give themselves an advantage in PVP, so Bethesda throttled the speed to prevent it from being an effective "map hack" tool.
---
I know the Xbox consoles coming out will be backwards compatible including several Xbox 360 games. if you purchase any new console you should just be able to sign in with your present account and everything should load in.
---
You're not crazy. So many people in this thread are, though.
---
Ghosts took 2 days from my Fallout time. I‚Äôm trying to balance them out. I don‚Äôt even really care about the skins and items from the legendary run but I do enjoy 76 too
---
Yes I was in a public team but I wasn't doing the silo? I was just chilling at my camp.
---
Tbh that's kinda lame because it doesn't really make it an achievement and I was kinda looking forward to getting it myself when I drop a nuke. But I guess what's done is done.
---
Alright.
---
I have 14 luck and often get one star legendaries from 3 star enemies.
---
Thank you. It's great to see dedicated unique user content. Can tell a lot of time and effort is put into achieving these great images. As a gamer and regular video/photo editor it's nice to see this care and effort put into a game. üëç
---
After some hours of playing I scrip daily 150 &amp; sale the rest to station‚Äôs vendor. I put to stash only TRADES with high value. I haven‚Äôt vendor in my camp
---
Desired things being in the Atomic Shop is less about duping and more about you using Atoms to get it (and hopefully purchasing Atoms to get it)
---
With the daily Atom challenges gone, and the only "grind" available Atoms are in the Legendary Run, the hope is you wind up purchasing Atoms to get the limited time items that wind up in the Atomic Shop
---
I'm sure I remember Bethesda saying these challenges would be "things you do during your normal play".  That was never really true since it included NW challenges, but for the rest it was pretty close to being accurate before.  But now you have to dedicate time to doing these things, so yet again we're getting something that's different than was advertised.
---
Not exactly. When you served hop, often the damage from the nuke follows. In the event it doesn‚Äôt, the message is still well received. :)
---
you know what. No random is ever going to balanced. For many many reasons. Random isn't really what people think it is. They think if something is straight up 3%, that means if you pick randomly 100 times, 3 of those picks would be the results you want. But that's not true. 
---
Balanced is also based on perception. I did Camp Fire tales about 7 times before I got the s'mores recipe. My friend has done it about 10 times, and has gotten the recipe 4 times.
---
The first fasnacht festival, I got the beret the second time I ran it. In fact, I got it a total of 3 times. The majority of people the first year never got one. 
---
The fact is, to get people to redo content, the rewards need to be random. There's just no way to provide enough content to keep people playing. It just takes to long vs how fast it can be consumed.
---
PS5 will play all PS console games ever made.
---
This as well.
---
You didn't read my post, did you?
---
I didn't say they are difficult. I said they are time consuming and luck based.
---
What‚Äôs buncha fuckin Marys. You guys should all get together and have a cuddle party.
---
Yes, no maybe üòÅ?
---
Ya it does. I think it's a 60 pct boost at full rank. So combined with a slugger perk maxed out you'd be at 120 pct I think.
---
Go to wiki there is a write-up explaining where the bobble heads are and it's divided up by the locations on the map such as the ash heap or the forest etc.
---
I felt so blessed when I got my bloodied meathook with 40 swing speed and 1 strength
---
I got the killing blow on a queen recently by kangarooing into the air and shooting her square in the face with a black powder rifle. I kinda feel I've completed the game now, I don't think I can top that. I could get a god tier fixer off mumbles then go to camp and roll a full unyielding SS set on my first try and it would still just feel like going through the motions.
---
Welcome...to Deathclaw Park *Jurassic Park music plays*
---
Yeah, I know
---
Couldn't agree more. Its nice to give advice but to try and force someone into a specific way of playing is just a dick move
---
Found one at alpha. Just in the workshop/shed before you go down the elevator. It's not hard to find a bobblehead imo...
---
I was planning to do that, I just wanted to get rid of the excess 2mm I had hahaha
---
I know there is a guaranteed three-star drop.
---
Gosh, I want that shotgun but... Ward :(
---
I find tons in my private. Either way it's not hard.
---
Including PS3?
---
Mine completed too bc a public teammate dropped one solo. I was around doing god knows what but definitely not that.
---
I think OP means that you should always get 3* legendaries from 3* enemies and this post is bashing the mechanic that is doesn't
---
I do have emergency protocols on my pa, but I'll have to throw on heavy gunner
---
Holy moley.  Bethesda should be paying you for advertising their game - your photos are amazing!
---
But those are 5 glorious minutes of pew pew pew üòÖ
---
Really all you need to do is max out one type of weapon damage card and bloody mess. Just doing that boosts your damage by 75 pct. The rest you can tinker with. 
---
AngryTurtle and Captainoob have some excellent build advice videos on YouTube.  You should check them out!
---
This is awesome well done!
---
My son had the same thing happen to him yesterday! Strange!
---
Me and my tons of god roll and legecys üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ crybabies loose again -
---
You finished a quest line. I forget the name cuz it‚Äôs been so long but that‚Äôs the reward.
---
It was AMAZING! Like fireworks and a sense of power, I shot everything in the room, the ghouls, the NPC's, the players... And then it was over...
---
Does that not make them difficult to complete?   
---
Or am I making too grand of an assumption and in reality you think they're easy to complete?   
---
I think you may be jumping to conclusions about my comment.
---
Not every response post is out to get you, calm down.
---
I‚Äôm sure that you can appreciate that you‚Äôre arguing an alternative extreme:
---
(1) Duping means that people have everything they could want and so don‚Äôt need / want to play anymore . 
---
(2) Terrible RNG means that you will never get the things you want so why bother trying anymore....
---
Both extremes ultimately result in the same outcome and terrible RNG is a driver for duping - that is indisputable.
---
What this game needs is balance - better odds of getting what you want is part of that. Account locking things actually reduces the likelihood* of getting what you want as well making (2) worse....
---
(*) somebody somewhere in the whole population is more likely to have a specific item than one player is....but if you can‚Äôt trade it....
---
In F04 max Strong Back let you fast travel while overencumbered. If you had companions you could shift gear to them. In FO76 you need to pay for FO1st and use the tent. At this point if they added this perk they would devalue FO1st so doubt they will add that in.
---
Aslong as I notice someone down I'll always rush over to revive, but I'm normally beaten by others which is nice to see.
---
Finding bobbleheads....
---
F@CC this challenge with a Mace!
---
The legendary challenge is easy, find the Leader of the Pack event, it will have 3 legendary enemies.
---
Explosive shotty is a god send at events like rad rumble.
---
This is incredible! Your use of the metal posts is very imaginative
---
Time consuming and luck does not equal difficulty.
---
It's a reward from the BOS questline.
---
Christ that's cool! Mad props for all the planning that went into this; nuke, aquiring three pylons, make ISS target your gf and then line up the shots perfectly.
---
I just wanna know when we‚Äôre getting 4 and 5 Star Legendaries.
---
It's mentioned that the raiders at the crater tolerate caravans in their territory and trade with them. They're definitely open to diplomacy but ultimately it has to suit them and they have to decide they want it. They're a group of selfish humans that believe they're entitled to what the settlers have because "they were there first". They're less sadistic blood thirsty maniacs and more selfish and greedy psychopaths/sociopaths that have no issue with using whatever gets them stuff.
---
I actually like the crater raiders more than the Nuka-world raiders as they feel way more human and grounded but tell you if you fuck up or don't pull your weight you're dead.
---
What are the differences between the 1 pm and 6 pm players?
---
True. One of my loading screens is a picture of Dany Devito photoshopped in a Vault 76 resident card
---
I think every train station should have a free fast travel to other train stations but removing weight limits would defeat the purpose of a very large portion of the game so I agree
---
Did my first launch on a half_ass stealth melee build (cause I had no real concept of builds and corresponding perks) with a decent troubleshooter's handmade. Chinese Stealth armor carried me through most of it, not to mention the lock picking and hacking perks. Watch out during the final phase, lots of recent silo snipers.
---
Doesn't matter to me. Just got me up some time I usually have a ton of 38. Sometimes a break out a 2 shot explosive pipe rifle for fun but haven't in a while so I can toss alot your way
---
The wayward?
---
There are a few good ones
---
Oh you‚Äôre approaching me
---
So you hate dupers but happily buy their duped stuff üòÇüòÇ- it‚Äôs like you trashing police for not stoping drug dealers but you got a kilo of coke in your bag
---
So that's why they died immediately. I guess I'll craft more vodka for the extra hp.
---
BOS questline rewards it
---
I found so much that i used 76 in a row for the challenge AND filled 3 displays. ( and after that scrapped 2 displays because it uses insane camp budget)
---
Every kill is a garunteed 3 star?
---
Don't really farm it considering it turns all of them in at once
---
It‚Äôs a quest reward, time to level up!  If you can‚Äôt find someone to put calibrated shocks on it, you can use T-60 legs with calibrated shocks instead.  It doesn‚Äôt change the armor rating too much.
---
This, but for ammo or chems.  I get more than enough junk already thanks.
---
Another meta build how unique
---
This.   You can't rely on just 1 - 3 places for getting a bobblehead.
---
Those a some awesome shots!
---
Why does everyone need god tier? You can clear the majority of content with non legendary(plenty of videos on youtube of it)
---
And you most certainly can get god tier gear, you just have to do work to get to it.  Odds will be in your favor at somepoint. I just picked up a heavy combat armor unyielding/powered/ammo weight from the purveyor.  I have enough decent unyielding gear to equip all 5 of my characters 
---
But to take it a step farther, most people only consider many items bad because of the flood of dupes. When good weapon A becomes more available, good but not god weapons lol like shit
---
This is crazy awesome! Alot of pictures that could be used as advertising for the game... i could easily see these images being a preview for the game. Well done!
---
It's a combination of duping and tactics by the company to get you to keep logging in.
---
The more times you log in for scrip or legendary modules or any reason really, is more times they can pop the atom shop in your face.
---
Bethesda likely only cares about duping since it allows players to get god rolls which in turn gives those players less of a reason to log in, seeing as they found their unicorn.
---
How does it work?
---
Great idea for a group, but the benefit you came ip with is too extreme. It should rather give weight reduction on junk or overall carry capacity imo. But we will probably never see something like that group,since scavenging isn't exactly a groupactivity. I hate going to a nice spot only to find it looted and avoid being in the general vincinty of any other player while scavanging.
---
I have 3 Bloodied Power Fists. You can have one if you're on pc.
---
But when is Meat Week
---
I dunno but I think it's still a couple of weeks away
---
I know its not a simple issue and has been a problem since Gameboy Color was released, probably sooner.
---
But the overarching thought is, it is possible to fix.  If someone cant explain it, they dont understand it good enough.  It's fair if we dont understand the details, but I'm curious how many of their programmers actually have a solid understanding.
---
In thier defense I assume they are all busy dealing with their own segments of code, once you combine them all thats when stuff gets weird... They would need to take the time to understand the entirety of its logic, a massive task.
---
From my understanding, yes. Any time that I‚Äôve been server hopping to try to get it to appear, if there‚Äôs a camp in a nearby radius there will be no random event spawn at all.
---
There's a trick to getting more if you don't know. 
---
Go to the bunker and start searching those desks. **DO NOT** take anything out of the desks. As soon as you find the data take it and go hand it in. Now log out and back in. Go back to the bunker. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Anything that was in the desks before now has a chance to be technical data.
---
Containers can be looted bu multiple people, also, 100% more of 2 adhesive is 4 adhesive.
---
Go do it solo and earn it!  It‚Äôs pretty cool the first time you do it anyway.
---
Yes, the YouTuber angry turtle just published a video yesterday I believe and stated that it is a guaranteed three-star drop and I have heard other YouTubers say that as well it's showing up on the PTS.
---
Where do they spawn. I only ever get raider punk and he‚Äôll be in all 3 spawn points
---
It‚Äôs not something i want to encourage here
---
Thank you
---
&gt;tactics by the company to get you to keep logging in.
---
100% the real culprit.  ALL the blame should go there, no exceptions.
---
Twas a joke. Realistic camps are beautiful my mates done a nice one that's not too extravagant but looks cool
---
I wouldn't mind a link to a build guide for this.  I've been running with full Unyielding and Max STR with my instigating DCG I found.
---
Account locking is easy, fixing the game must be very difficult if not impossible judging by their past record. The engine/code? I have no idea, but the Bethesda devs must do and it must be extremely frustrating.
---
I just hide in a bush, creep along, hide in bush, repeat to a top 10 finish.
---
Literally a trash can lid for a shield.
---
RIP YOU WILL BE MISSED SORELY!!!
---
They allowed all those ‚Äúbanned‚Äù dudes back. So, so much for that hammer, lol.
---
&gt;My second make of a plasma caster was just that B2525.
---
Nice, but meanwhile there are people who will make hundreds of them and not see such a desirable weapon.  That's the problem with the system, way too much reliance on RNG.  People may say they hate grind, but grind is preferable to the current RNG-fest.
---
Then I fail to see what you're whining about. xD  
---
I think you're a little hung up on a shakey technicality.  
---
Nevermind that you make several references in your post to how challenges used to be 'easy' and how they now cause you stress. Forgive me for making the logical assumption that you think they've become more difficult to complete.
---
Nevermind that I specifically gave you time-saving methods of fulfilling those challenges that don't rely on luck nearly as much. Clearly that's not what you wanted with the post?
---
Seriously, try not to be so defensive. xD  
---
This isn't r/unpopularopinion

August 18th, [This show's the calendar for the upcoming content](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg)
---
On east coast, my 1 pm players i see tend to be more relaxed. They have more time to play, they are on fresher servers right after the reset. I see more nukes dropped. 
---
By 6 pm, the more casual players are starting to come on. They just got home from their 9 to 5. They have a couple of hours to play before they need to have dinner or take care of kids, then go to bed and start the process over.  Weekends can obviously be different for them.  The servers have been up for a couple of hours, picked clean of some things. Existing players are dicking around. I see less bomb drops (though they start to pick up as the night progresses)
---
Wow they are a bit delayed on every seasonal event this year. It‚Äôs whatever though
---
Don't know what that means but thanks
---
We‚Äôre not. If they do, they will be account locked, which is lame anyway.
---
Level 69, only just got around to garrahan HQ last night to unlock PA (you level a lot apparently just wandering and trying to mark ever location before moving to the next)
---
Nothing is more terrifying than having to fight a cloaked dominator with nothing but a few floater grenades, a moderately upgraded handmade; and a full set of pocketed studded heavy leather, half of which was broke.
---
Died 5 times before I finally won the game of peek-a-boo because it refused to melee me and only shot laser once every 10-15sec
---
Right. I don't mind the character locked plans so much as it is an achievement to unlock things.
---
The problem is the scrip limit. It's again an artificial way to get you to keep logging in to buy modules each day. Worst mechanic in the game by far imo.
---
Nope. I'll always take any spare plans you have to sell in my bookshop, thought. I sell everything at most at a 80% discount. Lots of common things I sell for 1 cap. I'm right outside vault 76, so I'm mainly targeting new dwellers. I'll  heck to see which games I have when I get home from work. I think I have 4 or 5 of them right now.
---
Which as someone who has built a few programs, I would be so embarrassed by a mistake like that and would have fixed it ages ago.  I can't imagine it would even be HARD to fix since it likely just involves removing the Powered and Poisoners strings from their respective objects.  Likely something even an intern could sort out in 15 minutes.
---
That's what is bothering me most about FO76 lately. There is seemingly no sense of pride in their work.  Outwardly (to me at least) it seems like they've farmed this out to a group of interns who could care the fuck less and are just doing it to get something on their resume.  They probably don't even know what the game is about and just do whatever task they're given and move on, and the result is slapped together and pushed out without any care.
---
Basically we crave a fine dining experience, we're getting McDonalds staffed by teenagers who'd all rather not be there and with no manager in sight to make sure they at least half ass things.  (sorry I'm not picking on teens and I know a lot of you kick ass.  I just needed an analogy!)
---
Than why does the game have 5 stars?
---
I mean if you were having fun and progressing at your own pace, why change your entire playstyle because some min maxer told you?
---
Yes and no. 
---
I had my mules parked there for the longest time. As long as the camp isn't too close to the dilapidated ~~boat~~ building you can still trigger the random encounter there. I triggered the vendor bot and basically kept him there for 3 hours and all i did was sit in my camp and he was like 20 foot away. 
---
So if you're server hopping and someone is there still try.
---
i know that i find one hand it in go back till i find all other tech data in the desk not touching others hop then rinse and repeat problem is i run out of desks
---
I think that's just the natural progression of the game unless you have an experienced friend guiding you from the start. I did the same with my first character, played the story at first, explored, picked up a bunch of useless cards and gear, and at mid-60 level realized my toon was completely broken! Lol. Started looking at guides, saved up about 25 lvls, respec, and is decent atm (still need a few lvl to fine tune it).
---
i am looking for an area with lots that i can fast travel in and out of like white springs bunker
---
I'm kind of a junk / ammo vendor. Most of the valuable junk i find is from set objects (typewriters, toys, desk fans, etc.). Those are one time pick ups, first come first serve. You can exit blackwater mine with plenty of oil for example, but visiting becomes useless if someone else picked up all the gas canisters beforehand. The approximately dozen containers there still not make a visit profitable imo. Or take the army camps: you can get 16 ballistic fibre if you are lucky, but may go home with zero if someone picked those up 10 minutes ago. +100% on zero fibre is zero fibre still. My best advice is to totally avoid other people while scavenging. But again, a group i could join as a dedicated scavenger / collector still appeals to me. My character is a scavenger, i don't grind events but roam around, collect / buy / sell for a living.
---
I think part of the reason people dupe is the weapon disparity.  About 10 pct of the weapons are actually good the rest are just trash.
---
I think buffing existing stuff to bring it up to a decent level would go a long way.
---
I suppose it's because its several perk points taken up for only 40 weight; whereas between legendary effects lightening weapons or ammo/chem perks lowering weight of items directly, there are more efficient ways of holding more stuff.
---
That being said, I've still used it before, especially combined WITH weight efficiency perks, if in doing a scavenging run or hauling stuff to sell
---
till you do the follow me and some monkey comes along and one shots it, breaks my heart whenever i try to get everyone a tag only for the "miniture dickus" to come along with one of the \*cough\* totally legit Bloody Explosive Energy weapons \*cough\* and queefs on it instantly deleting the enemy
---
I agree, It's no small task. I know fixing just a few hundred lines of code can be very time consuming and mentally strenuous.
---
I expect the difficulty to be multiplied considering thier track record of producing generally buggy or broken games.  This comes off as a lack of genuine developmental experience, idk if they are using 20 cheaper fresh CS graduates instead of paying 1 highly qualified individual but that's what it looks like. Though, I could be the bureaucracy of just pushing new code, you could have someone who knows a fix but cant implement because of red tape.
---
Nothing against those seeking a degree in CS, as I am myself.
---
If I find any more I'll let you know, you could always try other military installations
---
It doesn't actually take the caps btw
---
I'll be on later - if you have a weapon in mind, I'll apply the skin and trade the weapon back to you.
---
The typo in the title had me picturing some kind of mechanized bedroom furnishings.
---
Power armor headlamps, I think
---
RIP
---
Dear god it's beautiful.
---
I mean you can put stuff in the corvega trunk too :)
---
Look at your caps before traveling and after. Just a visual glitch.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Superb shot! I'm also in awe of  the fact that you had the presence of mind to take the picture during that fight-- I'm usually too "ohshitohshitohshit" to even think about taking a picture, but I assume it's easier to do on PC than console.
---
Great to hear, will need so many of them.. playing only for a month now, cries in L.35
---
It always warms my heart when we're in the middle of fighting the queen or what have you, no matter how much is going on, as soon as somebody goes down everybody drops what they're doing and sprints over to revive somebody in trouble. You'll have 3-4 people all crowding around trying to be the first to stim them. It's awesome.
---
I won‚Äôt even get the chicken coup....
---
So if they can make that a guaranteed 3,why in the world isn't the queen? The ammo spent is ridiculous against the queen for the pay off(or lack there of). 3 queens in a row last night in a group of 6, only four 3* off queen body in total, mostly 1 stars.
---
Not only this but the camera more often than not never takes a picture no matter how many times I click.
---
Same for me, but I think I found my first one by that BOS camp near where the SBQ fight is.
---
I think it's because Wastelanders development took up so much time but at the same time I would doubt that would mess up reused events. Maybe it's because they want people to play with the new Wendigo Colossus event and felt like it would clash with that? Who knows why Bethesda makes the decisions but I'm sure it's closer to the second reason
---
Exactly. Also, if you follow the standard xp-farm route (huntersville - west-tek - NIRA - steakhouse - abandoned bog town - harper's ferry) you'll most likely find 3 legendaries, and will also level up, and find a glowing creature (there are always mutant hounds at dense super mutant spawn areas), if you're not level 600+ already.
---
As for bobbleheads - I guess it's better to serverhop.
---
Also, there's always an option to get 500 additional score via repeatable by just getting 50k xp, which is a rather small amount. That route I described usually gives much more.
---
What did they say?
---
Agree! And I find odd that the max level is 3 stars when you can clearly see there should be 5! Hope all our hard worked builds will not be overtaken by future dlcs!
---
Truly bad ass
---
I‚Äôm just glad you‚Äôre on PlayStation and not Xbox.
---
Aids lego
---
I mean yeah, but the Flea is only a little bigger than a stash box anyway, versus a Corvega is a whole car. Hell, the Flea looks about the same length as the Nuka-Cola/Red Rocket coolers, just a bit taller. It's a natural choice. The Corvega just takes up too much space to just be a stash box.
---
That really sucks, I wish I had one to give you. Did you specifically use it for healing?
---
No, it just had 50% extra limb damage. It was fucking BEAST
---
The medic perk was a nice touch tho
---
That's real and a bummer to hear.
---
I had first for a while too and have 60k lead and steel stashed plus a ton of acid.  Can't even guess how much ammo it would make.  Personal preference I suppose.  For me time not spent switching around perks and messing with the crafting menus is worth the small decrease in damage but again, thats me.
---
From the sound of it, you didnt get enough cuddles as a kid. In sad for you.
---
*World's smallest violin*
---
Teatties.
---
Makes total sense, so of course they biffed the fix and fucked it in adventure too. Yay....
---
That's a Big yes
---
Yes. You get a PA Chassis equipped with a level 50 set of Ultracite PA when you finish the BoS quests.
---
I think on the contrary, they kind of had to diversify the rewards to attract the most people. I know I definitely wouldn't have bothered with the legendary run if it was all goofy Jangles / space themed items, it's just not what I'm interested in. The apocalyptic stuff like the chicken coop and raider cage is what actually got me into the season and really were the only things I was going for.
---
That definitely sucks. I am sorry you lost your favorite gun. I hope you find another one like it soon.
---
&gt; I shouldn't have to memorize what resources are at each one since it isn't fucking showing that info.  
---
Wait, [what](https://imgur.com/a/TfqF8MP)?
---
That‚Äôs all perception on the players part. I‚Äôve been running the same weapon for over 120+ levels. It‚Äôs a melee weapon. It‚Äôs not bloodied, junkie or any of the weapons prefixes that people feel they need.
---
It‚Äôs really about something else.
---
Also: hitting her on the head make her stagger and cancels landing. Just hit her on the torso.
---
Hm, after 350 Levels with two chars i see no big problem in finding three legendary somewhere in apalachia, or googling the possible location of a bobblehead and finding it with  ease with the right perk equipped, or doing three random events...
---
That's a really huge present
---
Anywhere with safes and cylindrical filing cabinets. Watoga has buildings with some of those cabinets.
---
Thank you.
---
Diversifying the rewards means there's more for tastes to appeal to different people.   
---
I know I wouldn't have bothered even participating without the Raider cage and chicken coop, not interested at all in all the goofy sci fi stuff.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have to fucking take a workshop.  It should just be given to me
---
considering the unban wave that just went out for actual item dupers id say your pretty much green lit to use this way less serious glitch consequence free. id be genuinely surprised to see anybody get into serious trouble for this after legendary weapon dupers got let off with a warning
---
Cool. You clearly have a lot of time on your hands, though.
---
I was think that the other day. Like if you‚Äôre in a team or friends with someone it could share the loading screens.
---
Thank you. I will try to move on, but it‚Äôll never be the same.
---
You sound like a bitch to me
---
I have started using my low AP modded radium rifle on mobs, with 85 rounds and gun fu is is anything but useless.
---
so why should a CHALLENGE not consume a bit of time? and need a bit of luck? where would be the CHALLENGE if it where not so?
---
The only thing about Bloodied that needs a nerf is the unyielding armor. +15 to every special is just way to OP. I honestly think +1 to each piece would be a fair compromise. 
---
This is coming from someone who played as bloodied for a long time. I love all the other synergy about the build and I wouldn't change anything else about it!! Like Sarge said it gives you tons of ap, strength,  intelligence,  etc which makes the build so much better than anything else by far for general gameplay. 
---
I like the idea of buffing other stuff to create new and interesting ways to play the game.
---
I can‚Äôt explain it because it was over a year ago and it was just a couple videos. I‚Äôm not a computer programmer so I don‚Äôt spend much time thinking about it day to day.
---
It has nothing to do with my not really understanding it. That‚Äôs just you being rude and dismissive. 
---
I‚Äôd rather not try and explain as I understand it, and make a mess of it.
---
nope
---
What do you play on? I have a decent pump I might be able to part with if your interested
---
Did you have a skin on it? That is the reason I won't use skins, if you drop it or put it in a container other than stash by mistake its destroyed.
---
True, but I'm not really hurting for Ammo and Bethesda isn't exactly consistent with when they do or don't ban for something.
---
I understand that. My sister lost one of her favorite weapons and it devastated her. It will never be that weapon, even if it‚Äôs the same stats. That weapon carried you through many levels early on.
---
Not so much because I was told to, just something different to try, if it makes the grind to easy then it's back to scaving
---
PS4
---
Agreed, have never and will never buy any of the mascot outfits. &lt;=/
---
Thank you! I didn't take any pylons last night since we were there only for the photo shoot. My girlfriend took two and the third was taken by our friend who was also the one firing the flamer for added effect. 
---
I was in the Chinese Stealth Suit which is pretty good for taking pics but I break stealth quite a bit when sprinting to wherever the action goes. We also die quite a bit and use a lot of Stimpaks on our shoots.
---
The worst enemies however are the bushes. I have many great shots which are ruined by foliage. xD
---
If you're interested I have more shots here: [https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery)
---
Are you saying for instance the pricing for the secret service armor should be higher with not cap limit on how much a person can earn in a day?
---
Don't worry, BOS has the whole rest of the year to get their fill of content. =P
---
Then where is my Power Armor? Finished this quest 3 days ago.
---
You on PC?  
---
I have a Bloodied power fist with Limb damage. Free.
---
any paticular building and decently easy to farm?
---
at the moment, yes, indeed. but its all been done within 60 to 90 minutes, with no running around and stressing myself. a bit of planning, knowing the map and, of course, a certain portion of luck i guess...
---
That wont be difficult.
---
So that means adventure mode has to suffer too?
---
Ya, the whole fomo thing.
---
I thought you could choose if it gathered weapons or other items. I'm I bit disappointed. I just wanted the weapons to scrap for the mods
---
&gt;The weight thing was to help with mule duppers.
---
Not being able to fast travel while over your carry weight was not intended to help with dupers.  It is a holdover that dates way back to Fallout 3 and before that even Elder Scrolls single player games.  IIRC some of the early versions didnt even let you move at all when over your weight allowance.  I'm sure it's a happy coincidence for Bethesda that it helps control dupers somewhat, but it's not why it's there.
---
To be honest if you're reaching the limit just with plans it's probably time to lower your prices and/or drop stuff that you can find so easily it just won't sell ever. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thank you! Most of our photo shoots are planned but that doesn't mean we don't die a lot and use many Stimpaks! xD You can see more here: [https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery)
---
i had a similar feeling once when i dumped all of my fusion cores and power armor, it was like, whoa, i can move!
---
I DID! That‚Äôs so stupid! How is that something that is in the goddamn game after two years!
---
ALL video games rely on you repeating content to keep playing. 
---
Yes, Bethesda absolutely cares about duping as it shortens the play life of a game. All games require you to repeat content, either by trial and error, like in Single player games when you fight certain mobs. Or by random drops like in Online games.
---
And that's not wrong. It's not invalid. They can't not create enough new and engaging content faster than people can play through it. Simple aspects like voice recording can take months to get down.
---
A new outfit for my allies who give me awful weapons from the weapon cases! üòÇ
---
Purple is friendly and can not be killed.
---
Red is Vengeful and will attack.
---
Yellow is a Coward but can be killed.
---
Green is Glowing and will attack.
---
Already confirmed there'll be BOS rewards for the ATLAS events, Brotherhood fatigues, a Brotherhood Banner and a Brotherhood Collectron are among those we know about so far. More later.
---
Punishing them with a good time, I like your style
---
It's terrible in gamers.
---
Mines all ghoul slayer
---
My heavy gunner is still pushing out good dps bwhahhahaha
---
The game should really include an auction feature
---
Thank you so much.
---
So you can't give skins to another player they don't own. There is a warning I believe but with lag and such easy to do when dropping a bunch.
---
Sorry to hear that. Here, have some cake üç∞
---
You are right.. maybe just give some the to a newbie, a sweet soul gave me 15 when I started with my gipsy wooden camp.. really do love this community
---
I don't think people were downvoting the question, they might have been downvoting the "*waves*" and whatever :L is...
---
Can't agree more.
---
That's not the only spot the Responder Vendor Bot spawns.
---
Yeah it killed me not to be able to use those railings everywhere else.
---
You don't have 60 to 90 minutes to play? Lmao
---
I looked all last night and a this morning, spending over 1k caps and eventually just said to myself Bethesda can take their bobblehead and shove it
---
It's only painful when your squad doesn't realize you're down while you're dying
---
Lego needs support and could not be placed.
---
Weapons and ammo is one of the options. It will only gather stuff from the list in this post though. For just gathering mods I wouldn't really suggest it, the weapons it finds are either useless or easy to get large quantities of off scorched.
---
I thought your last scorch beats queen picture was one in a million, now I see you have a gallery of just wow. Great work
---
The system works exactly how they advertised, actually. Up until now there were no dailies/weeklies that won't represent something that people do in the game. For example if you don't look for bobbleheads, there always are people who do. If you don't play nw, some people still do. They never mentioned that it's gonna be something that a specific person (like you or me) does as they normally play the game. It's what players in general do.
---
Here're couple examples of what theys said in the ITV article prior to season start:
---
"While Challenges are here to stay, we want you to be able to complete them and earn S.C.O.R.E. in many cases by playing as you normally would"
---
So here it is: "In many cases", not "always".
---
Also:
---
"Instead of having to take a picture of another player in a Rad Storm, you may be asked to 'Earn 1 Level-Up', 'Complete a Public Event', or 'Kill a Legendary Creature', among others. These are all things you might already do regularly during your normal play sessions, but now those same activities will add to your S.C.O.R.E. and push you that much closer to your next reward."
---
And here it is again: These are all things you ***might*** already do regularly during your normal play sessions
---
These are typical statement constructs used in politics and advertisement to make a promise without actually making a full on promise, so yeah, we might get what we might get.
---
Wow,how the hell do you implement that in a public server? 8 fast people join and the other get screwed? What if the screwed ones are your friends that you need for your strategy? Absolutely stupid.
---
I only use "META" build for leveling up my one character for the incoming legendary perk.
---
I didnt know that. What other spot does it spawn?
---
I play Fallout, not Fortnite....
---
I've been sharing Perceptibobble on teams due to this challenge. I like to pretend I'm helping!
---
I'm on Eastern too and usually log on around 6 am and play until 2 pm.   (breaks in there for meals, etc.)  The nukes are always in the morning and often come in triplets.   After 9 am, I don't see hardly any nukes.   Interesting that we're seeing the same pattern but in a slightly different time frame.
---
I wear a bloodied faster swing Bowie because I can't find a combat knife, to support my commando build
---
Mine appeared in my inventory as a generic power armor chassis but with 0 weight and when I deployed it it had all ultracite pieces and now weighs 10 with returned to my inventory.
---
Alot of those people had account wipes so I doubt they'll be back.
---
Not every day, no.
---
I do have to work.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea!
---
Schools...I usually find one in the Watoga High School principal‚Äôs office.
---
Ohhhhh. That‚Äôs probably what happened. I remembered seeing a text box. I just assumed it was because I had it favorited
---
I'm sorry I can't help you out.... I got an exterminators explosive pump and I'm a commando build. I keep it as a back up because I run an explosive handmade so with maxed demolition expert it's a beast even without any shotgunner perks. I know someone would get better use out of it than I do
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that is the Atomic Shop version. We get a dirty one from the drop pool
---
On runescape there‚Äôs an event going and theres a big ass crab that pops out of the ocean and everyone has to unite and kill the crab  TOGETHER And it was fine until someone brought a death-touch dart where it literally kills the enemy  upon contact and when they put two and two together, oh my god... there would be a massive hoard and all you will see is a dart being thrown and the monster will sort of freeze from the lag before exploding. It‚Äôs not fun for anyone and they get all of the xp/rewards. The mods fixed this eventually but it went on for way too long
---
Yea that what I‚Äôm saying let people have unlimited trade for treasury note into gold bullion 
---
And rise the SS gold bullion price to x2 or x3 so it balance out for releasing the the ‚Äúgated locked‚Äù
---
Did no one use Percepti-bobble?  
---
I was sharing it all day yesterday.
---
I had one within 5 minutes..
---
not endorsing or discouraging here but if you did wanna do this youve basically got a free pass, if bethesda is willing to unban weapon dupers theres no way anybody is gonna get in trouble for this
---
There's some more raider/dirty stuff coming out soon, and one gnarly looking grill in this event. Or do you just hate the idea of seeing other people in this outfit that much? Which would be understandable but you can just block those players lol
---
This again?! This game, or any game, do not cause stress. You are stressing yourself because you have conditioned your brain to think you HAVE to do some things. You do not HAVE to finish the dailies. You do not HAVE to finish the run. You decide the effort you want to put in based on the value the reward has for you. Personally I find it ridiculous that you think these challenges are that challenging. I get all my dailies done within 1 to 2 hours max, mostly within the first hour. Most challenges are things you would do playing the game naturally, and I for one, prefer having to hunt down a bobble that have to remember to switch to a clown costume before leveling up. Also, it seems that someone that says they would "easily" finish the run, can easily skip a couple of dailies anyway.
---
Agreeeeeed! Boosting this post so people can see
---
I do this, so I appreciate it friend
---
I am a faction player. I appreciate faction-based cosmetics....because it helps with immersion in the game.
---
I just hate seeing the utter ridiculous outfits that are more akin to Fortnite, Overwatch and PuBG.
---
&gt; yet I have a display full of them
---
so you admit youre adept at finding bobbleheads? Im not seeing the problem here...
---
Well TIL how to actually use these maps.  I thought you had to collect them all and piece together like a puzzle.  Now I know what to look for and gonna start hunting.
---
Found this website that helps with location also:
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide/
---
Oh sweet, I was just thinking it's too clean. Where the hell would Grahm find this? Looks like we're gonna get to see some dirty udders though
---
I hate players that insist on not sharing the legendary spawns. Omg the sloth at fasnacht was ridiculous. How hard is it to just run up and bash it once and use the follow emote to help everyone so we all win something. The public teams help in case some bloody asshole comes to one shot it, as long as a teammate gets a hit, you can get the drop still. Share the wealth everyone
---
It‚Äôs fine. Thanks for offering. This sub is the best ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Wack. Guess it‚Äôs just another bug in the game that I didn‚Äôt get mine. Oh well, easy enough to make.
---
This sub is littered with ‚Äúthese challenges are so easy and can be done in 15 minutes‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNW winter challenges are hard and should reward more‚Äù
---
‚Äúchallenge X is too difficult Bethesda please give us easy guaranteed score‚Äù
---
Basically there‚Äôs no place in this world where everyone is happy. But we are all free to have our opinions
---
This has happened to one of my characters. I too used the score camp skin. I'm not moving my camp. I put too much effort and time into it.
---
Apologies as that's not intended to be rude.
---
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Is merely a qoute from Albert Einstein.
---
I'll be the first to say Im definately no professional programmer and dont know the details myself, I wouldnt expect anybody here to provide a simple explanation off the top of thier head. Its not a stab at intellect, we simply dont need to use the info daily hence lack of familiarity despite having comprehension.
---
Yes. You have the atoms for it you can.
---
Why would you pay now and not wait to see how far you can get?
---
If it's wasting that much time for you to find a bobblehead, I'd recommend server hopping at 1 location. Tyler County Fairgrounds has 2 possible bobble head locations. It took me 5 minutes to load into a server that had one, at which point I could continue with the other daily tasks.
---
This looks like Warhammer 40K.
---
Agreed. This is anti inmersive AF
---
What happens if you drop a nuke while the encryptid event is ongoing? Would it kill the imposter? Would you get the rewards?
---
F
---
So I do not have to commit myself to daily play on two accounts AND to give money to a company for a game I love.
---
I can earn enough money in 2 hours to fund the entire run on both accounts. Why wouldn't I?
---
Yea that bubblehead shit was annoying 
---
I‚Äôm tried of the 3 legendary bullshit too 
---
My group does leader of the pack when it pop up and we kill them unharmed so that everyone in the group get a tag
---
Ah, thank you, I clearly didn't remember that all-important weasel-word in their sentence.  Well, the main point is, if you want to keep earning SCORE, you are more and more having to spend more time focusing on it.
---
I too am annoyed by these but i just run that caravan mission u complete 1 event every time and guaranteed legendary
---
Me and a buddy used that and found 2 of them after about 10 minutes work. On a near full server as well. 
---
As for the legendaries, riding shotgun and leader of the pack.. Worst case scenario you need 1 or 2 server hops. People just want to complain they can't finish these things all in 5 minutes half the time it feels like.
---
We don't talk about it much but this game is a graphical masterpiece.
---
Impressive
---
Damn wish I had your job xD
---
So our toons don‚Äôt know how to sew and be creative?
---
Lower your voice before Bugthesda gets too hungry :/
---
You could have just said nobody took it bro. I didn‚Äôt know there was a change I came back from not playing to playing for the legendary board sheeeesh
---
It's been a while, but they do come out with those. I actually HATE when they come out with faction stuff, because that's all you see in the atom shop for a month lol. I've heard for the BoS returning we'll be getting some free BoS stuff before it hits from the community event
---
I barely have time mostly but riding shotgun and leader of the pack takes you at best 1, maybe 2 server hops and maybe 10-15 minutes work.
---
What build are you running?
---
I don't know why they even made a craftable one when they could have just made the stein display have snapping points for the camp stein. 
---
And before anyone says that it would be too hard, they literally already have that capability with the greek column and the statues. It doesn't seem like it'd be impossible to translate that
---
I do not think it offers good value for the cost /opinion
---
Herding cats.  That is what Bethesda has to deal with.  Herding cats.
---
(Granted, they still need to fix their buggy game though)
---
Say that in-game and see what happens, I'll make ya suck udders for saying that lol
---
Yeah but does Grahm?
---
It probably does, but since it is a weapon best used charged the benefit is reduced.
---
This can happen if you get disconnected with the "server not responding. controls disabled" message.  My understanding is that the server isn't able to save your character, so you get rolled back to the last save point.  Any items you may have picked up during that time are essentially lost.
---
Junkies/power armor heavy/stealth commando
---
bethesda ban fallout 1st members over ammo? ill take things that are never gonna happen for 200, vulpy XD
---
Just look at a map you lobotomite
---
Wow you weren't lying. Those are great!
---
did you hit your head and forget which company develops fallout 76?
---
Is this perk working? I tried it last night and nothing. I just found 2 bobbleheads stand next to it and 0 sound.
---
Not really into udders mate, but thanks anyway
---
Never heard or seen anyone complaining about the challenges being too easy, but that might just be me.
---
To take a more ... idek, cynical? Sarcastic? tone - yes, it must be incredibly hard to find a middle ground. Like, you know, somewhere between harvesting ten of the most common plants, and sending us all out to find several of the same specific rare/unique things. Must be even harder to balance it in a way that we have maybe one or two of the latter a week with the rest being easier ones, instead of having to hunt legendaries *and* bobbleheads several days in a row. 
---
Common sense is hard indeed.
---
^((I mean, I'm not blind, obviously they want us to play as much as possible every day, those are the good numbers to report to their shareholders. But it shouldn't be so difficult to see where the scales tip over on the wrong side.))
---
Touch√©.  
---
Maybe he traded with other people and then give it to us as rewards. I‚Äôm sure we can come up with a reason that‚Äôs not like random fortnite skins haha. But graham is very creative but his fingers might be too big to create a 1000 of these for us.
---
Btw I‚Äôm excited for this meat week
---
Yeah you're right about that. I'd try and test it in vats still, but I don't have an FFR Gauss lol. It would still be useful in vats because you can only charge the first shot but yes, it's severely niche in that kind of role
---
They banned 1st members for duping weapons, as it should be.
---
So you just want this to be easy for you, and to hell with anybody who like something that requires more time and challenge. 
---
Guess what that's not how anything works in life. You want all the cool prizes for free and easy. If you really want them make time, or spend atoms. Sure found time to voice your complaints online. If don't have time, welcome to the real world where you don't get to have your cake and eat it too.
---
Must be nice =0
---
I wasn't offering, but see ya around
---
Oh big true, I like that reasoning
---
Yeah it was working for me about 2 hours ago.
---
I'm lvl 140, no specific build i'm basically the embodyment of the:
---
"Noo you gotta have a build in the endgame'
---
"Haha strong weapon kill enemy"
---
It works but the sound is faint.  You have to turn up the "Effects" slider to max.
---
It sounds a bit like glugging water.
---
This would work really well with solo queue only matches.
---
A stealthy night time sneaky BR works best when teams of 4 people aren't leaping around the map with grenade launchers.
---
Thank you for making this comment so I didn't have to.
---
I never bothered to look at that. üòÖ I guess it's okay if the game is just visually glitched.
---
I‚Äôm Enclave to the bone...we‚Äôve gotten dick compared to the other factions.
---
It must be Planzheimer's
---
Love the effing "ma'am" as she steps over my lifeless body after one hitting me with her face laser.
---
Fair enough
---
Not if I see you first cow-boy
---
Gotta say, when I started playing 76 kinda late into the game, I fully expected half the population to be running around in memey outfits like swimsuits with chef hats and fashionable glasses, or nurse dresses with those giant fasnach heads. But I rarely ever see anyone actually clowning like that -it's either full PA so you can't even tell what they look like, or people rocking their rugged wastelander aesthetics, or level 2s still wearing their party hat until they reach the Wayward then walking out without it. 
---
It's... unexpected, but kinda refreshing that people kinda keep to the theme even when the game already offers a lot of memey outfits as it is.
---
No games are designed to cause FOMO and microtransaction addiction these days.
---
South of Morgan town. I‚Äôve also found him near the junkyard
---
This challenge can go suck a fat one. Took me 5 fucking hours of searching before I finally found one of these stupid things, and yes before you ask, I had the perk for it equipped the entire time.
---
Extremely rare and hard to find items should NOT be part of the daily challenges.  
---
I have the same problem with the bubblegum challenge too, but at least with that one I can just save up my bubblegums from perk packs, which I've now started doing.
---
I‚Äôm gonna ghillie your mom tonight.
---
Pretty much start there and then all of the locations just north of there on the map have at least one spawn point each, Aaronholt has 2.  Percepti-bobble definitely helps out on this one though.
---
I forget the name, but the ice cream place north of Vault 76 is a reliable spot.  At least it was pre-wastelanders, I haven't tested it in a while.  Fast travel there and run down the road towards the white bus.  If it doesn't spawn, server hop and try again.
---
Yes!!
---
Wow I had no idea I‚Äôm about to do that now.
---
Because meat hooks are apparently awesome in that they are affected by both unarmed and 1h perks. At last that‚Äôs what I read
---
yeah its all for show
---
I feel your pain. My story of loss is different yet just as painful. I was lower lever, 50ish, and had gotten a really good gun from fasnacht. I don't know all the specs but it was a 3* quad handmade and I traded it for the circus trailer plan üòñüòñ I still think about that gun.
---
I actually am horrible at coming up with complete ideas on my own, I am pretty much only good at improving on other's ideas. Now there would be a dream job if it existed...
---
Literally I put the perk I and played the game as normal and let the challenge happen in corse if time rather than flip out over it like this.
---
The cake us a lie.
---
Fix all in this shitty Game.
---
people are gonna lie to you and warn you might get banned but considering the unban wave that just went out for people abusing a way more serious glitch, id say your pretty much greenlit to do this as much as you want consequence free. its so easy to pull off that big portion of the community is already doing it all you do is blueprint a wire and your done. anywhere you place them is permanent unless you delete your whole camp though which is kindof ass unless youve got a nice chunk of flat land you havent already built on.
---
Camp related you're right. However you guys get a few cosmetics. I do suspect that if they up with the "two factions" mentality when they introduce the new Brotherhood, then the opposing faction will probably be the Enclave
---
Right?!?!? Best response to thus bullshit post.
---
I have an instigating lever action on my rifleman and I absolutely love it. 
---
Also, just pick a main weapon and roll with it.  The longer you wait the more "out of sync" you can get.  If you get some awesome stuff for another type of character, just roll a new toon and spec. it toward that weapon - I'm about to make a new shotgunner.
---
Yeah it's always done this. Its the same bug as the dragon bodies in skyrim following you. On the bright side if SBQ dies outside of the world border you xan try and trigger this to get her in a lootable position
---
This glitch literally has been around since the game is out for some reason.
---
It's kinda stupid, but funny xD
---
Nothing new, happens once in a while, rejoining the server fixes it for me.
---
I hope so...there is an X-02 skin that‚Äôs been in the files for ages.
---
Thanks, I give it another shot. Once I have searched and learned all the map now it should not take much time :D
---
EDIT: I put the effects max, turned all music to down and I could hear a faint air whirling noise.
---
&gt;From now on, challenges are going to be limited to what I normally do in a play session.
---
Funny how they claimed that's exactly how they changed the challenges - so that would be the case. Easily doable during a normal play session. Then again, iirc they never really specified how long they think the normal play session is.....
---
I support this idea. This would make hiding in the bushes so much easier.
---
Even worse, most bugs could have been prevented if just 1 person at Bethesda would actually play F76. No extensive testing or shit, literally 1 person using the buggy stuff they intend to release.
---
I was pretty frustrated with the bobble head thing but read a post from this subreddit and took their advice and picked up the perceptibobble perk and headed to Camden park. It helped me find the bobble head in some office. If you do decide to try this, the sound is a little subtle.
---
based
---
I finished FO4 without a clue how to use perks.  Don't feel bad.  Fiddling with perks is one of the more fun things in FO76.  Good luck.
---
Fix the shit Gauss Shotgun, to many damage in a far Range.
---
I started selling the Halloween Candy from Monster Mash for one cap apiece. Good for the vendor daily, or the "Eat 20 Pre-War Food" daily, weighs virtually nothing, and I have hundreds saved up from doing one Monster Mash event.
---
What level are you? If you can wait, I'd wait until patch 21. One of the new legendary perks I think doubles/triples ammo production?
---
I play ps4 and have a few shotguns if u need a new one. I've made this mistake a few times so i totally understand the struggle.
---
Robco is usually good for tech data.
---
Yeah, that or make it a one point perk for agility or strength, or something
---
Probably, I get one per several hours of play, got a combat rifle too.
---
Damn where are you camped out?
---
No, PS4, but thanks!
---
I've gone solo and killed 17 people in a single game with the Gauss shotgun and I'm pretty ass so yeah it's bullshit lol
---
BuT My ImMeRsIoN!!!!
---
The big question is. Are you a bloodied build?
---
PS4 lol. Thanks anyway &lt;3
---
The bobblehead took the fucking piss it was like as soon as the daily changed all bobbleheads was removed across all servers was looking for like 4 hours last night nothing. I was able to do it this morning but 4 hours none stop hunting them down in most of the kown spots and nothing.
---
The problem i have with the dailys is most of them are just annoying more than any thing.
---
Yeah not a possible roll
---
Why does this read more like the 'bug' is actually a 'fix'? XD
---
4+ Int is literally an exp increase.
---
556/45/5/50 in that order
---
I completely agree with what you are saying. But Bethesda honestly doesn't care what anyone wants, or has to say, they have been stringing us along with broken promises, and lies since  before the game was officially released. It has been half fasted and nerfed for their benefit since the beginning. It kind of reminds me of how casinos work. 
---
At the end of the day the only players that benefit from this game are the new ones, any players that have been playing this game since launch have been taken advantage of, walked over, spit on, and ignored. We give them a inch and they take a mile. 
---
I have been playing this game since launch, 3700+ hrs, I have spent close to 500 CAD, I have tried on many occasions to make simple requests, and report bugs. At the end of the day, I am just a number, a easy target for them to take advantage of, there is no player loyalty with this company. If they cared about the out come of this game, they would respond to players feedback, more frequently, and ask us as the player base what we want from this game. Instead they come up with schemes that are only going to benefit their bottom line. 
---
I guess business is business, but if they think they are winning, they are only setting them self's up for failure for future generations of gaming. 
---
It time for the community to stand up and demand better from this company. We paid our dues, it's time to reap the rewards of our time supporting their broken down golf cart. 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best!
---
A game tester?
---
guess i gotta get a pc now
---
Then why don't they add them to the atom shop for say.. 20 atoms?  It's still about money.
---
Nice, super close to the raider and photo dailies too üëç
---
&gt; Also, why the mess in the Misc tab? I hate having to look thru tons of keys, passwords or keycards ive picked up to check things like ores, fuzzy tokens, technical data, etc, that i pick up from quests or mine/make,
---
sorting by weight helps
---
it's an old, rather common and under-reported bug that Behtesda seemingly can't fix because it's hard to replicate and their netcode is awful.
---
what happens is that sometimes the game desyncs from the server and thinks you're doing something that you're not.
---
say you have the pipboy open. then you close it. except the game desyncs and the server misses the packet telling it that you closed the pipboy. now you press reload, which is the same key as drop.
---
the server, thinking you still have the pipboy open, drops whatever is highlighted. and you'll only notice it once you fast travel or relog, because that's when your character gets saved/refreshed.
---
this happens all the time in scorched earth. or when the game is being particularly laggy. it can happen when selling, scrapping, scripping. even storing items in your stash.
---
Wait, what is this ‚Äúbuild‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about. You mean I‚Äôm the only one running around with every piece of my armor being different?
---
ok ill go have a look in a little bit
---
Tell me about it I don‚Äôt play much until lately but the one day I had all nuke codes but no briefcase. Have not even found one since then. Where are they located at
---
Logic doesn't seem to prevail with some Bethesda staff it seemsü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇüòÜ
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
I can turn myself into one if I want. I have 43 extra levels that I can change my special stats around with
---
I tried doing it for the challenges. I only played one game and got off. Not cause it was bad but bc I got destroyed. I haven't played enough to make an opinion tbh
---
Awesome Pics
---
This is one of the few bugs I don't mind, because legendary scorchbeasts tend to home in on the fissure from a mile away after being killed, becoming unlootable.
---
It would literally take less time to type ‚Äúbobble head daily‚Äù and find 20 locations with multiple spawns than it did to write this
---
Uhhh yeah that‚Äôd be pretty dope. Dm me maybe we can do something today?
---
Happy camper makes it so you barely ever get hungry and a private world means no players to attack you.
---
Looks epic! I'd probably die if I try this :D
---
I understand how you feel. I too am very much attached to my favorite weapons and probably cry my ass off if I lose one of them. Good luck finding yourself a new buddy
---
I love it!
---
Im level 73
---
I bought 3 plasma grenades for 1 cap each last night, and I didn't even realize it was to probably help someone get the daily. Thanks vendor!
---
It‚Äôs a free system that gives you free rewards for playing the game.  I swear we gamers get more and more entitled every day.   ‚ÄúAll the free stuff you gave me doesn‚Äôt live up to my expectations‚Äù.  Get some perspective...there is a game right now charging 300 bucks for a skin pack and Beth just gave us a TON of free stuff just for playing.  Just shut up, say thank you and keep the opinions of what free stuff you didn‚Äôt like to your entitled self.
---
Finding terminals to hack (that somebody else hasn't already hacked before you) is bad enough. At least with those, each terminal *always fucking appears exactly where it's supposed to be.*
---
But with this bullshit bobblehead challenge? Comments like "jUsT LoOk aT A MaP", or "jUsT FiNd a gUiDe onLiNe", or "jUsT wAtCh a viD oN yOuTuBe" **are completely unhelpful**. Because all the guides and maps in the world won't help if the fucking thing refuses to spawn where it's supposed to.
---
Let's try to avoid RNG-based challenges in future, please Bethesda?
---
totally agree took me like 1h to finish.
---
had to search online and still had trouble to find. Not Fun.
---
What have you done to deserve a nocturnal lead pipe though?
---
Thank you! Got it at the Silva Homestead.
---
key word weapons
---
Shotguns should have some range. No idea why games make them useless after 5 feet
---
How's it not being considerate of others? If you don't kill the ghouls, you fail the event. There's no time for everyone to get hits on each one. Its easy enough to shoot into the crowd with an explosive weapon or Tesla rifle and get tags. If you really care about XP, go farm west tek on a private. As for legacies, people like you would always be like "add them back into the loot pool or remove them because I'm too lazy to get one myself". Well with the amount of them now, theyre basically back in the loot pool. All you people do is complain. Also, hasn't the tr@demarket always been like that? Pre dupe all anyone wanted was bloodied or legacies. It really hasn't changed all that much. Also, havent you realized who I really am yet?
---
Well, that'd get you one rank. But if you plan on getting other legendary perk cards then the stuff to make ammo isn't hard to get
---
and because you are reloading 75% less, your sustained dps against tough enemies is actually quite high even compared to bloodied.
---
But DO you want to be one? If so the bloody Gatling laser would be leagues better then the furious one. If you enjoy high health though, just go furious.

Did you have a chance to check? What rank are you at and how much SCORE is needed to get to the next rank?
---
Seems cool
---
I run bloodied unyielding for the strength boost. I have to keep my treasure horde of unused chems and misc stuff, just in case I need it. Never know when ill need 3 lvl 50 sheepsqautch skull hammers.

---
No players ever attack me while building, it‚Äôs the NPCs who do. Also, not all of us have our perks set where we can use happy camper at a 3, it‚Äôs pretty useless at a 1
---
Being a scrub in a shrub is only better if you are bad at the game. Regularly getting to the top ten while killing is more profitable.
---
Why not just strip the skin automatically when it drops
---
At this point I'm convinced it's all of the AGI perks, sneak is broken too

---
Strange mine do not show up just like the OP.

You has play Nuclear Winter with the shitty Shotgun?

You can shot same with the Sniper, and the Range with the shotty is the Same... Too much for a Shotty and with Explo too....

That would be nice, kinda like naming a weapon it reverts to original.
---
The Furries are already overcome I see.
---
Im aware of that. But its not obvious to a faur few players.
---
...Bethesda having quality control? 
---
I'm not sure they've ever even *heard* of it.
---
I didn‚Äôt realise I need this in my life until now
---
Could you tell me what plan provides those neon letters please ?
---
Here is a good guide.  (Not mine.  I meant to post a link to the original, not the whole post)
---
Edit:  here is the link to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ba3oyb/technical_data_hunting_some_tips_and_data/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Technical Data Hunting - Some Tips and data.
---
I decided to start actively hunting tech data, today I got the last of the current rare drops with the T60 BOS Elder paint, and thought I'd share some tips and data on what turned out to be quite the grind.
---
Technical Data is found in Round filing cabinets, cigar shaped bins and some desks (some have found in other containers, but I am unable confirm) , Once you have completed the Brotherhood of Steel mission "Forbidden Knowledge" you can turn in this data at the basement room of Camp Defiance, there is slot in the wall that you can use. There is XP, Caps and loot to be had, the more you submit the more XP and Caps you can get (This max's out at 4 pieces)
---
This was done on the PC, but no reason to think other platform rules are any different.
---
There is 3 types of Loot than can drop - BOS Shielded Underarmor plan, Apparel and Paint Plans. (Also some ammo, caps, XP and aid always drops).
---
**BOS Shielded Underarmor Plan has a chance to drop -** You need to learn the other BOS Underarmor plans bought from vendors before this starts to drop. This is a separate loot, and can drop in addition to the following.
---
User  u/eckserah has done some data mining, the way the loot is calculated is it'll roll for apparel, if any of the apparel succeed it'll drop and stop and not for paint, if its unsuccessful, it will roll for paint. The data mining suggests that the type of paint drop is random, however the experience of everyone who has received paint strongly indicates it drops in the order set out below, and only after you have learned the previous rank.
---
Note - All % are based off 232 technical data submissions and rounded to nearest %point.
---
**Aid and Ammo always drop**
---
(equal chance of each)
---
Stimpack
---
Super-Stimpack
---
Rad-away
---
Water
---
\+Random Ammo (sorry did not capture this)
---
**Apparel**
---
31% Chance of Dropping one of the following items
---
Field Scribe  Uniform -16%
---
Engineers Uniform - 25%
---
Bomber Jacket - 30%
---
Army Fatigues - 10%
---
Brotherhood  Scribe Outfit - 6%
---
Science Scribe - 13%
---
**Paint**
---
6% Chance of Drop. Note, Starting with Knight, they drop in order, but only after you have learned previous rank. -
---
T-60 BOS Knight
---
T-60 BOS Knight Captain
---
T-60 BOS Knight Sergeant
---
T-60 BOS Knight Officer
---
T-60 BOS Paladin
---
T-60 BOS Elder
---
Note - Pieces of power armor when painted will have the labels of BOS II, BOS III, BOS IV, BOS V, BOS, BOS VII.
---
**BOS Shielded Underarmor Plan**
---
Currently unknown chance of this dropping.
---
**Armor**
---
There is also additionally a 13% chance of a Random 1\* Piece of Max level Armour. (Strangely I never dropped a Right Arm).
---
**Tech Data Locations**
---
White Springs Bunker, military wing desks (26 in the room, plus one in the detention room)
---
AMS Watago (28 Desks and Filing Cabinets) The place is packed with turrets.
---
Robco Research Center (12 Filing Cabinets)
---
Sugar Grove (15 Filing Cabinets)
---
VTU (12 Filing Cabinets)
---
Watoga high school, (12 file cabinets and one safe.)
---
Chareston Herald (12 File Cabinets)
---
Monongah Power Plant (Approx 12 in power control room)
---
Thunder Mountain Power Plant (Approx 6)
---
Alpha/Brave/Charlie Silos Sites - (A lot, but a right pain to farm due to turrets, enemies, and distance you need to travel between submitting)
---
**Tech Data Farming**
---
When you load into the server the loot in each of these containers has a chance to be either tech data, ordinary loot or empty. Once you have looted the desk of anything it will not respawn loot again for about 72 hours (I've been unable to find exactly how long, there seems to be some rng on the time).
---
So to maximize your chances, look at each of the desks, if there is technical data then grab it, and submit it, if there is anything else, leave it, the next time you load into the server the loot changes with a chance of Tech Data.
---
**Safes**
---
They all have a chance for technical data, no info if increased difficulty increases the chances of tech data, but the loot rules are the same, if they don't have tech data loot, leave whats in and the loot re-rolls when you next load into the world
---
Notable Chest Locations
---
Flooded Trainyard - 5 safes
---
Harpers Ferry - 7 (2 needs some parkour)
---
Watoga Civic Center suites - 3
---
Lewisberg  Cemetery - 4-5 Safes with some in town.
---
Pleasant Hills cemetery   - 3 Safes
---
National Radio Astronomy Research Center - 3 Safes
---
**Other Tactics**
---
If you have a very patient friend who has not completed the Forbidden Knowledge quest they can stack, drop and sell tech data, they can farm much faster as they do need to submit the data everytime.
---
However, it appears that they can only loot techdata from a container once, not completely confirmed but when I tried with an Alt character and the Whitesprngs bunker had not refilled after 108 hours.  (I'll continue to check now and then, and update this post if this changes)
---
To transfer the data, the best method is to trade. Dropping or putting into containers sometimes does not trigger the item as Quest when the main picks it up.  
---
With player vendor and trading you can buy these plans, but note, for example if you buy and learn T-60 BOS Knight Captain before you drop T-60 BOS Knight you will never drop T-60 BOS Knight and the next paint drop will be T-60 BOS Knight Sergeant.
---
**Things I don't know..**.
---
I don't know the actual refresh rate of containers, it appears to be between 48 to 72 hours, or it could be an entirely different mechanic, worthy of a separate post.
---
I don't know what rare loot drops after Elder, another poster has submitted 40 techdata after learning Elder and has not received anything other than basic loot, not conclusive, but not looking good.
---
I don't know if SPECIAL has anything to do with it, I have 12 luck and have not tested with anything else.
---
I don't know the % Chance of Technical data spawning in a container, I did not track this, if I had to guess I would say low, 10%-15%, an unlooted Whitesprings bunker has 22 containers and typically has 2-4 pieces of tech-data.
---
I don't know if submitting multiple pieces changes the chances, I tested 10 times with 2 bits, the % seemed the same.
---
**Conclusion**
---
If you are looking for a full set of paints and you have average luck you'll be aiming to submit around 120 pieces of techdata.

---
**Disclaimer -** This is only one persons experience, yours will be different. If several people want to provide their data I'd be happy to compile to be more accurate,  but even if we got and compiled 100 peoples data, yours will be different, there is so many rolls going on here the chances that anyone's experience will be identical are astronomically small.

---
I dunno if it was 'over' but it was definitely a healthy amount
---
I‚Äôve had a few times with four codes and no case. Only one time did I find a case in a random shack next to some power armor. Of course I didn‚Äôt get to use it because I was soloing to grind creature kills.
---
Try it. It definitely does.
---
Wolf Horde at Tyler County Fairgrounds, ez 3 legendaries, no one does that event and it always pops up.
---
If a player 200 levels higher can one shot me I should be able to one shot them too!.... also It's not hard to believe a 3 star enemy can have a shit gun when I see level 200 + players running around with subpar gear frequently. Now I'm not digging on you cause I don't think it would be an awful idea to get higher star weapons for lower star enemys, but only if it was extremely extremely rare. What we need is a gun buy back event where after we do some redundant shit for a police protectron, at the end he will let us sell any starred items to him for a much much lower return than purveyor even if purveyor is out of scrip. The story would be ok too with the protections talking about how a gun buyback program will make Appalachia safer and how robots are the only ones responsible enough to have them.
---
100% agree with this.
---
High intelligence builds are a waste of time. People wanna speed thru the season? Fine but don't complain when other people wanna take it easy. I'm rank 53 and just login do my dailies an weeklies which takes 3hrs total on Tuesday an log off for the day. Every day after it takes 1hr to complete dailies. Nothing more an nothing less. People who want to speed thru the season ranks are pure idiots in my book. Thinking they don't have enough time to get to rank 100.
---
You wasted bullets? Come on down to crimsons bullet emporium where we sell every bullet for only 1 cap each
---
I can buy it too but I play everyday so I might as well just see how far I can get. I‚Äôm about to unlock the scout ghillie one so like 63 or something. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll make it to end with out spending anything.
---
That‚Äôs true. Plus actually fighting allows you to get better.
---
Don't reply to me
---
So, okay, it's Bethesda we're talking about here, but I've never even heard of this being an issue much less seen it.  What platform are you on?  Are you hovering over the map icon and perhaps getting something else occupying the space nearby, like a player or event?
---
If I remember right, there was a way to in FO4 without being in combat. I think it was holding run when getting in/out?
---
Not sure why it's not in 76. Then again, they killed off a lot of PA things from FO4 to 76... which really sucks.
---
Why the downvotes? That doesn't explain anything.
---
Brahmin pond, near Central Mountain Lookout
---
Alright bloodied it is lol
---
You'd have to be at the event so you'd most likely die when it hits but I have read that it does kill her and you do get the rewards.
---
Come on my guy, don't be like that
---
But i want to see what other players have built in the same spot as me.
---
This is a good bug that you can make use of, maybe it‚Äôs even intentional and not a bug. When I farm in cranberrybog and kill those SBs mid air, I simply keep moving and do other stuff, at the end I fast travel to watoga station and voila, the SBs I killed would fall on me for me to loot them all at once, this includes the queen too. This is great because their bones and wing fragments are heavy af, if you loot them at the time you kill them you get easily overencumbered before you find a work bench.
---
Your leg is a T-51b there
---
I think it's just not showing the stars. A 3 star the fixer with prime reciever has 5 legendary effects... so I can see how in coding it views max as 5 but we can only get 3
---
The true hero‚Äôs of the wasteland. I turn my mic on and tell them ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù every time people like that show up during uranium fever.
---
Your right leg is T-51b thats why.
---
yup

I meant AP (action points, i wrote it wrong in spanish, wich is Puntos de Acci√≥n lol, sorry about that)

... oh my god guys. Thanks. Didn‚Äôt see that AT ALL.

Who is your least favorite if not him??
---
PS4, its just something I just noticed last night after I took over 5 workshops. None were showing any info just the name.
---
no, that's not possible since all three of these are prefix modifiers. You can only have a prefix, major and minor modifier.

Will do. Thanks!
---
BGS is so bad at game design they nerfed the ban hammer!
---
I agree that this challenge is a bit of a bummer.. But bobbleheads aren't really that rare. the problem is that when it's a challenge everybody starts looking for them and they're gone from the instance pretty quickly. outside of challenge I stumble upon them pretty often, as soon as it's daily they become scarce. This is a really stupid challenge indeed. Should rather make it use instead of find at least.
---
The world design and creature design is awesome. The new lighting that was added with Wastelanders makes most things look better but in some cases depending on weather, time of day etc it can make some textures look super dark and overly shiny. Some of the textures themselves are pretty bad up close but overall I love it and love taking photos!
---
Gotcha! I didn't know that! I guess we did just finish that quest.

Its old but should still be relevant.

Thank you! xD

i saw this post but its a bit old and things have changed i was wondering if anything better was found
---
Sitting right infront of the boxes where the ghouls spawn = inconsiderate. The ghouls prioritize the turrets.  If you keep them repaired, which is very easy,  they flock to them and it allows others to get tags.
---
I know exactly who you are. Being selfish inconsiderate with an "all about me" attitude, flaunting legacies, and bullying other players with OP legacies is exactly how you loose friends. Maybe you should re evaluate the way you see shit.
---
1 star or 3 stars is the only difference actually. With three you get 20% more vats each shot. With one and two you get like 3-5.
---
Every day there‚Äôs a post asking for more specific or obscure emotes when the original issue would be solved with implemented text chat. If this sub got every emote it asked for our wheels would be way overcomplicated.
---
depends on your weapons. for auto rifles, yeah. huge difference.
---
I found it in whitesprings golf course. If it‚Äôs not downstairs near the one safe near the showers go around to the back near the kitchen little area where there is a clown in the fridge and there is one between picture frames on the wall near golf clubs. That‚Äôs where I find a bunch of the ones I have and found it next to the pictures on first run through
---
I hate this gimmicky shit.

LOL no, people would dupe anyway. It's not about how rare it is, it's about the mentality

Flip side it keeps me from scriping them or dropping them by mistake.

You can have 1 camp and there's a budget of what you can build. You can have a decent sized camp but it's not close to the camp size of fallout 4.
---
kill 10k ghouls? are you mental? fucking boring, wanna farm mindless like this go to BDO where you can do thr kill 10k monster quest whenever you like it.
---
You don't have to commit to anything. Just play the game and last week of the Season buy what ever you have left.
---
Buying them now makes absolutely no sense, as then you have no gains from dailies or weekly challenges. The points do not crosso er to next Season and there is nothing past level 100.

Vats being usable for creatures and nades  is not a glitch
---
took me three hours yesterday, using Percepti-Bobble and a wiki for locations, to complete the daily challenge to find a bobblehead.   I tried both public and private servers
---
I never noticed a difference between the two, so I consistently run with a Rank 1 Concentrated Fire perk card. VATS is finicky anyway so I don‚Äôt think it matters. Any problem you have with accuracy is likely going to be due to something else with the game (ie bug), not the card or the lack thereof. Just throw on Rank 1 so you can target the limbs and enjoy yourself.
---
Edit: as others have said, there is jump with 20% VATS, so if that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs important to you, then I‚Äôd think about Rank 3.

Its hard to find un hacked terminals?  They are like in every building.

It means the location of caps stashes.
---
I usually fast travel to the Charleston Trainyard. Then take the red bridges north towards the Charleston Station. By the time you cross the second red bridge, right as you‚Äôre coming up on the station, the random event should trigger. If there‚Äôs a camp nearby, or if an event other than the vendor spawns, server hop and repeat.
---
Pretty sure nades are at least, but I would have to confirm the information my friend gave me about it
---
Ally with the Raiders
---
Same thing is happening to me right now. Loading is taking forever right now.
---
How did anyone finish it already without glitching, cheating, or buying their way through it?  I‚Äôve been hitting the dailies and weeklies and maybe didn‚Äôt get 2 or 3 of the NW dailies done. I‚Äôm only half way to the end. 
---
If you didn‚Äôt pay for atoms to finish it, it was a free event. Why be disappointed in something that didn‚Äôt cost anything to do?
---
That was my clumsy fault. My IGN is pueo, not pue.o. I was on my tablet and tired -- a combination that can turn my fingers into unruly sausages.
---
I think you can start that one from your personal terminal too but I'm not positive
---
What platform are you on?
---
I play with rank1 too, but as i see from comments for auto-rifles Rank3 is better choice
---
If ur on pc there‚Äôs a mod for that
---
You don't need to play everyday, but you'll progress just by playing. So if you wait to buy near the end, you'll end up paying less so you'll have more atoms to spent on something else.
---
Is there something special about this encounter or not?
---
what is the point on having 3\* ledendary enemies if they drop most times just 1\* items? Bethesda should had fixed this crap already.
---
I assumed eventually the 2 other stars could be filled on a weapon via crafting. Kinda like prime receiver. But if that ever happens it'll prolly be atomic shop or legendary run animated skins for gear. Guns that are animated with fire, cold, acid, digital decay etc. You know enemies explode into confetti type stuff that doesn't actually make your gear stronger.
---
As I said earlier. If you want XP, go farm west tek, or if you're that pissed, sit on the boxes as well. Also, so what if I'm proud of my guns? Its a damn video game. Grow up.
---
Make an option then
---
Do you not think that I did that first? Why else would I be venting?
---
I had someone do it during the Encryptid event. The thing which takes me lots of shots from my pretty solid built at level 80 got killed so fast the second its shield went down I didn't stand a chance. 
---
Same person just went around the map to every event, one shotting every legendary that spawned. 
---
Had to change servers, they single handedly ruined the game for everyone else.
---
Amen brother.
---
Annoying they put it under resources
---
Yeah, obviously that's not right.  Is it always like that?  PC here, never had that as an issue.
---
They better improve the whole game mode before they add more shit to this broken piece of shit, aka lag, crashing and freezing fest. Also, I don't know how some lifeless people keep playing to the +400 level wich is really sad since this game mode doesn't deserve our time. Is a pain in the ass needing even more experience to reach the next level. I just want my rewards, so 400 lvl guys, go find another game and let us play!
---
I mean that's my whole post.  You buff everything, and add in mobs that can handle bloodied stuff as it is, as well as the new buffed stuff.  It's not like you have to pick one or the other, you can do both.
---
And google seems to indicate it's origins are as a descriptor/slur of poor rural farmers, which was co-opted or "reclaimed"  for a time by labor movements in the Appalachian region to help promote unity among workers who might otherwise be set against eachother by employers and society.
---
So I still don't know what's so sad about it's origin, unless you mean it's later involvement, or perhaps I totally missed something you'd care to educate me about.
---
When I am not purposely out looking for them. When I am just out exploring.
---
I had it custom made, yeah I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere either.
---
The other day it took so long to log in. When it finally did all my dailies auto-completed. Yesterday it was fast(normal) and no dailies got messed up.
---
I forgot to say there's not even a proper single player/solo mode, so fuck it.
---
mine does too, because i gave her a copy of fo76 and i somehow regret it,   
---
because she does play pretty evil. She is sad, that she can't join the blood eagles.
---
Are you quitting the game?
---
Did multiple server hops for two other locations. Even went on private server. No dice.
---
Buy it on one and maybe work for the other one. If you love the game half the fun is grinding the daily/weekly challenges.
---
Yeah how very dare they! Thirty shook dog had a whole section for thus one thing called free money!!

They are really dumb to let dupers keep their duped stuff. Many players always say ‚Äòno reason to play‚Äô after they acquired their ‚Äògod roll‚Äô,  yet Beth has no idea. For each duper they tried to keep as their business, if each gives away or sell ten ‚Äògod rolls‚Äô to others, that‚Äôs ten potential businesses Beth will lose soon. Idiots sitting in the office looking at spreadsheets are shortsighted and clueless.

Not all Settlements in FO4 were the same size.
---
When was the last time you got something good from a legendary? I have a lvl 156 character who has BE plasma, BE flamer, QE cryolator and a BE minigun, and all weapons that I have were bought from dupers
---
Quick answer: Depends!
---
I'll assume your about lvl 40-50 and have no problem taking about the average enemy you come across.
---
If your stealthing about your likely taking out enemies really quick and wouldnt benefit from the perk.
---
If you get swarmed by 20 supermutants all using automatic guns it will do you little good since it only effects the guy your presently shooting, ricochet is what you want. But a stealthy character such as yourself probably shouldnt expect to draw too much gunfire since a fully built stealth character could lick a mutants nose undetected, idk how much PA will impact your sneak ability though..
---
Now, supressor WILL benefit you when fighting a singular tanky enemy such as the SBQ, deathclaw, etc.  Keep in mind most tanky enemies use melee, meaning blocker might be a better alternative. Both would be most ideal.
---
Overall, how often do you find yourself fighting sturdy enemies you cant quickly dispatch? If the answer is more often then you would like, then supressor would be a good investment, though bloody mess could help you bump up that DPS helping avoid the problem entirely.
---
I find more in my private than public.
---
I had a three star card for ages. Dropped it to one star and honestly never noticed a difference in damage or anything. I honestly don‚Äôt know what the extra stars even do.
---
I took the two Perception points from Ranks 2 and 3 CF and saved them for other damage-related perks. I like boosting my damage per shot so it takes less hits to kill enemies, and I never struggle with running out of VATS prematurely. Admittedly, I use one of the most powerful auto-rifles you can get, so I understand not everyone has that advantage and that they need to focus on damage per second. 20% more VATS would definitely be helpful with that, especially if you‚Äôre not maxing out your rifle damage with perks, anyway.
---
Thank you üôèüèª
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bug. It‚Äôs been around for too long

Oh, Paige for sure, it was every interaction with him that got me to keep all the gold for myself. His attitude was just so sh!t.

For me it‚Äôs the person wondering if Sunny now has Ice cream since he got a fridge. 
---
Fricken go ask Sunny!!
---
Oh ok so how do I get to the options "menu" I'm on ps4
---
Your friend is wrong.
---
Because it‚Äôs easily exploited, especially for real money
---
Yes I have. The shotguns on this game are trash(better off with a melee) so actually kind of glad they added something that actually works. If you shoot something irl from 20 feet away with a shotgun it will probably not survive.
---
I've never noticed any change. Does it at 5pm for me. Has done since day one.
---
Being proud and constant gloating/showboating are two different things. Youll learn that someday. You might also learn to consider others aswell.  Have a good day.
---
That's true, still feel like the build budget was much bigger to each settlement in fo4 compare to fo76.
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying.
---
I see posts like this more and more often lately. I see how frustrating it can be, but then again, it's a challenge. It shouldn't be easy, but this bobblehead thing is a bit annoying because even though they're not that rare they're gone from servers very fast. what was more frustrating is finding out that even a private server doesn't make it any easier. what a joke, I haven't used my private server for a few days and yet a lot of containers and stuff that usually spawns in certain locations is gone, including bobbleheads. when i play normally I find those little devils everywhere, I don't need them already, but as soon as the challenge starts.. none xD apart from that legendary kills are pretty easy to get if you know where to look. Some people already mentioned a few events and places.
---
Probably depends on what you're carrying. Pack rat + traveling pharmacy will give you "more" space to carry other items. Strong back is good for overall weight. 
---
Personally don't use either pack rat or strong back unless I know im going farming for legendarys/junk. 
---
That and theres other mods that help lessen weight if that's your thing. Overall those points are probably better on some other perk unless you're doing something like a heavy gun build and aren't farming.
---
Yes, crafting it to stable flux makes it not decay.
---
Also, inert flux solves dehydration.
---
Well, you could drink it. It works the same as water now.
---
Before wastelanders it was always at 4pm for me. (UK)
---
Lol fair enough he was definitely a moron
---
I used it as water. I use my purified water to dilute rad x, radaway, and stims
---
I thought they were too small. I could never make the kind of settlements I wanted. Like the Starlight Drive In. Highs space but I couldn‚Äôt make the small town with roads I wanted too
---
SBQ should be 100% 3 star, and/or more than one.  It's THE end game content.  It should at least feel like you might get some end game loot, instead of the 100th ultracite pipe pistol receiver plans.    
---
While youre at it, make legendaries drop the star the have 100% of the time.
---
You drink it. It's better than purified water, - it weighs less and has more benefits.
---
And yes, converting it to stable flux stops it from decaying. Although that requires some more additional crafting components.
---
LOL true!
---
Drink it down and convert it too pee!
---
*laughs in FO1st*
---
ü§£
---
Ah if it isnt grahms brother who is obsessed with all things cosmetic. If you wait till his tan is done you will see him head over for his pedicure next.
---
Yeah. But I‚Äôm not interested in FO1st.
---
my main weapons HM, Fixer &amp; Laser rifle. 
---
Yes I do understand - CF Rank 3 means: VATS is better, more your shots must hit target. But tbh I havent noticed it))
---
Since when have I not been considerate? All of my legacies sit on my wall now, I only use them for queen or imposter. I quit PvP a while ago, and I've given away practically everything I don't use to others. Maybe you'll learn to see the other some of the story before you judge others. Clearly you have no idea what Ive actaully done for others. Cheers.
---
Omg!!!!!!! Hahaha
---
Yes but the rewards aren‚Äôt worth it.
---
maybe there is something to that method..
---
These are unreal. Inspired is right. These are better shots than the official ones Bethesda uses. They should be paying you. Keep it up!
---
I don't think anyone complains about the easy to do ones.  Those are the ones people prefer, so they can do it quick, then get back to doing what they actually logged on to do.
---
It was until the season thing started. Personally I don't mind, seemed daft having seperate resets for challenges and ATX.
---
Last time we had that challenge, it took me 5 fast travels to known level 0 terminal locations before I finally found one that someone else hadn't already beaten me to hacking.
---
Do all you people play on 1st private servers or something?
---
I'm calling a fat BS on people complaining its too easy. Never seen any person complain its too easy.
---
Iv'e seen people complain about a lot from the run but easy? Nah.
---
This needs to be so much higher! I‚Äôm not a junkies build right now but I‚Äôve collected a one star 50 cal and a sledgehammer. I only use psychobuff fighting and grape mentats when shopping so I would avoid psycho as an addiction for sure.
---
How was the loot from all the robots? Did you get flux materials from them at all? This has my interest
---
It's when buffs finish usually.
---
Yeah just make sure you play only when you're alone. Feels like you're watching porn or something when someone walks in and you have this loading screen
---
My hacker was a bit high in the sky  [https://imgur.com/a/Bem0aee](https://imgur.com/a/Bem0aee) ... such a shame
---
The excuse for supermutants weren‚Äôt a stretch, their backstory was actually pretty interesting and completely made sense in the lore. Now the BOS thing that‚Äôs a stretch, but they weren‚Äôt civilians they were a group of the military who were in Appalachia when the bombs dropped. Both of these do technically make sense in the lore but bringing the institute into Appalachia? There‚Äôs literally no possible way to do that without adding some stupid time travel crap, and even then nobody likes the institute. The only reason the BOS is there is because everyone likes them for some reason
---
Ah good, then I will not chuck it lol.  Thanks everyone!
---
Then you screw over the NPE by having a huge gap between complete inefficiency against enemies scaled to the endgame gear.
---
And again scaling the game to bloodied means basically adding 0's to everything, and that kind of non adjustments end up in binary fights where you either meet the gearcheck and always win by a significant margin or you don't meet it and basically fully depend on your build &amp; gear with no inbetween.
---
The stats should meet on a medium, not crank everything up to 11, the "only buffs no nerfs" mantra is an non functional application that only creates large grind issues in the long term where the only way a player experiences the game is through swinging back and forth from underpowered to overpowered once the grind is done
---
No. But it doesn‚Äôt matter, actually. Whether your daily play time is five hours before the reset or five hours after the reset, it‚Äôs still one reset per day.
---
Yes, Glow Sight is +60 damage to glowing enemies but, do you get the 30% addition for using a Ghoul Slayer's weapon as well, for a total 90% damage increase?
---
No first time I saw it, going to have to file a bug.
---
Fuck....lol
---
I'm starting a petition to make nukashine work with quack surgeon
---
There‚Äôs another bug where a supply drop will drop near/on you, it‚Äôs hilarious but annoying when it drops into your base
---
I remember playing a monk in Everquest and having to stay under 15 lbs.
---
That is very kind of you. Thanks for the idea :D

Yes! There was quite a bit and the longer you leave the ISS alive, the more robots/loot there is to be had.
---
Signs and Letter from the robot vendors. They cost around 10k caps.
---
Love your work Just Inspired!  You are awesome on your photo's.  Truly amazing.
---
Thanks for the info! Gonna have to try this now
---
A company which produces buggy games and feeds of delusional people like you lmao. Bethesda are rubbing their hands üòÇ
---
Around that level as well and not as frequently as before but once in a great while. But im not a fair comparison to you in this debate because I've never participated in duping or bought a duped item. At least I understand why you want 1* enemies to drop game breaking gear now lol. I can't sit here and say that 76 isn't ridiculous with it's rng, because it is. But I CAN say that I have no problems enjoying the game and being effective in pve and pvp with the gear I've EARNED thus far.
---
90 is a lot of time to commit to a video game every day.  The idea that if you can't play an hour or two every day that you don't "deserve" the rewards is asinine.  A lot of people cannot do that because they have families and responsibilities, and there's no good reason to tie it to daily log in other than to manipulate player engagement numbers.  Passes don't need to be like this, many passes aren't.
---
There's a terminal built into the collectrons pod where you can select what you want it to search for.
---
I enjoy the games...
---
If you've been playing this game for more than a month you should remember where at least one spawn is. It took me literally 5 minutes to find 3 bobbleheads at top of the world.
---
Yes, fuck Foundation Gauss shotgun.
---
Yeah, at the very least in terms of loot drops SBQ should at least drop 1 guaranteed 3-star for being the raid boss of the game. She's literally the main antagonist of the story and her setup is unique (requiring you to launch a nuke to make her spawn, which is already a separate mission by itself).
---
Speak for yourself. I love some of the rewards! Admittedly, some of them are not my cup of tea, but they may be someone else‚Äôs. If none of them are your flavor, then don‚Äôt play.
---
Oof. Someone fell asleep while UV mapping.
---
Regardless of liking the games, i play F76 a lot and it‚Äôs still a buggy mess almost 2 years later with minimal change. No way I‚Äôd throw that amount of money at them. But each to their own
---
Aww nice. We met and fell in love through this game so it's very special to us. That's a story for another day and another post though! xD
---
xD
---
From now on I'll be dropping inventory items even more carefully...
---
Grahm is one of my favorite NPCs. This made me happy. It is now my headcannon.
---
I imagine they've just finished the settler rep grind.
---
Don't get me wrong it is not a bad weapon by any means, but when you get B2525 you are kind of hoping it is Fixer or handmade and not a single shot weapon.  Still better than a F2525 Blackpowder rifle
---
They need to increase the budget size and build area for a camp. Understand why it's limited, but sick of not being able to place something due to one tiny rock being in the way.
---
Oh. I'm just talking about the legendary run. Ignore me.
---
One thing I'm wondering, I know psychobuff can produce a psycho addiction but not a buffout addiction, but does taking it satisfy a buffout addiction? I'd test it out but I don't want to have to reset my addictions if it turns out psychobuff won't satisfy both.
---
For my junkies melee/commando build I'm currently addicted to psycho, alcohol, med-x, and mentats. For the fifth one I'll either add a buffout addiction if taking psychobuff will negate it, or day tripper (if I can ever find enough of it to become addicted...)
---
Farming whiskey is great for a melee build btw - with the party boy perk it yields +6 strength, and you can be effected by both alcohol and a chem simultaneously.
---
if youre backing it up with other sneak effects it shouldnt be a problem.. even at 1 point...
---
harder to detect on armor yo.. get some if you dont have it already...
---
Well it's a good job i, er, left him there sleeping.
---
how about "point" as well.  very hard to indicate anything right now.
---
Probably xp with a one shot build or a bloodied build and being a high level they are probably doing rad rumble, scorched earth, one violent night, and encryptid to get lots of xp which is easier than leveling up
---
Yeah but my play time is normally 1 hour before the reset. And now with the fear of auto completes I'm having to log out from 15 before and 15 after (I know I don't have to but I'm scared haha). So I've got like 45 minutes to do all the dailys. And some, not many, can take a bit of doing. I also can't do much playing after the reset due to life
---
That's all besides the point though. Was mainly just wondering if we were given any info. Which it doesn't seem like we were. So thanks for the info!
---
For me, that's always the first attribute I max out. I have been in numerous sticky situations that have only been escaped through sneaking (especially having butt loads of junk on me). But if you don't find yourself taking it slow then put it elsewhere.
---
Yep, it's a known bug with the new skin....
---
I agree. I bought fallout 1st to get rid of all the junk and yet I'm still at my max capacity for normal storage because of plans and stuff I want to sell and that doesn't even include legendaries, I scrap them as soon as the cooldown is over because I need space in my stash box.
---
Agreed. First it took me forever to find the railings (under defenses) and then I found I couldn‚Äôt use them to make a dock, walkway or balcony.
---
It is the skin, unfortunately.
---
same!
---
1 placed Camp per character. You can have 10 Blueprints, but they are way smaller than camp Budgets. Placing Blueprints down is not easy and the game refuses to place them sometimes.
---
get one\*
---
it doesn't stack.
---
Do you not have any hacker perks?
---
Thank you so much. Glad you like them. :)
---
Big bend tunnel east outside, locked area has combat rifle, combat shotgun, and missle launcher.
---
Especially getting rid of the whole "cannot delete/move or else parts of the structure will be inaccessible" crap
---
depends on how much you'll be relying on sneak. for reference, agility up to 50 affects your ability to stay hidden. 24 is not even half the cap.
---
people boast about how reliably they can sneak without any sneak perks but I can't seem to replicate it. if I want to stay hidden 99% of the time, personally I need all the sneak-relevant effects maxed.
---
I used tons of mods and built a huge Vault Tec city in Sanctuary with close to 150 dwellers each with its own little house and everything, plus a GECK-assisted rebuild of Vault 111.
---
It was glorious, until one day the Xbox couldn't load the game anymore because the area was too resource heavy and kept crashing the game. I tried to replicate the settlement as a mod and by fusing together assets to make the whole thing less resource intensive but then 76 dropped and the project died there because I don't have enough space to keep both games and an overmodded Skyrim.
---
scorched in camden park often carry them
---
Shotgun can hit harder and saves ammo. I prefer it over the Gauss mini.
---
As a group we are just as strong as our weakest link.
---
Ad Victoriam !
---
Do you use photomode or do you just take "raw" images with the in-game camera and edit in PS or something?
---
It's probably because the double xp makes it more fun, so it feels so much quicker. Time flys when you're having fun!
---
Because that would require competent developers.
---
Is that a new thing BC in the past you dropped flux if you died after the queen event was over
---
It‚Äôs a double score weekend.
---
i didnt find a single one :(
---
Ooooooooooh, completely missed that ahaha
---
NW is trash. I'm always placed 2nd because I'm playing solo but the fucking game joins me against full 4 players teams, and my random team mates immediately die right after the match starts... so fuck it. I just want my rewards but it really pisses me off needing even more experience each level.
---
I find them often at Blood Eagle camps. My camp is next to one of theirs. I have dozens of each one of them now. I never use them as I figure I will save them for a special occasion that never comes.
---
I've taken to nuking peoples camp locations if they do anything wrong. It's way more fun than just griefing any resource generation they have.
---
I absolutely love it i think they are doing a great job with making the game better I got mine through the score there are a few things I would like to see happen in the game but overall I think they are doing great I think if someone pays for the fallout 1st I think the storage amount should be at least doubled or even unlimited like the scrap box. I hate how some people cheat on the game. That damn god mode pvp should just be shut down, hell if you wanna pvp do NW. It would weed out and get rid of a lot of the cheaters.
---
yeah i've seen those
---
sounds fun
---
i just didn't think it would work for those low level robot. i just wanted to see NPC vs NPC, NPC vs mob, or mob vs. mob action. then i was like, "holy crap they're doing it!"... "[no way!](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HcrHDG9ML8A/XxxPWYQ9pcI/AAAAAAAABDE/rZzFMBU2XRkE2C1zoym1nimgoa5kfj6VgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ScreenShot102.png)"

UK Plugs.
---
I think it is still pretty much accurate for farming.
---
&gt; This again?! This game, or any game, do not cause stress. You are stressing yourself because you have conditioned your brain to think you HAVE to do some things.
---
You are mostly right.
---
But no, he(or she) did not conditioned himself. FOMO and the structure of the Legendary Run did.
---
If your play time *was* one hour before the reset, it‚Äôs now *two* hours before the reset. Which means you have more time. 
---
And the instances of auto completing are far reduced and Bethesda is actively continuing investigation and repair.
---
Flavor? If you enjoy paying atoms for the rewards, I‚Äôm not speaking for your play style
---
Experiment.  Approach a turret while crouched.  Observe the brackets around Hidden and Caution.  Notice how they move as you get closer?   Now backup and take off the Sneak cards.  Approach again and note the difference.  This will give you a good idea if you need to sneak card at all.  Or perhaps you need all the help you can get.  Turrets are a great constant to measure against.
---
It's sad that the medic trophy is very rare on the ps4
---
Pro tip. Just do leader of the pack. Take it slow and let everyone there get a tag in.
---
No my play time is now 1 hour before the reset. It use to be right at the reset.
---
And I'm aware, but the day they had said it was semi fixed I logged in 2 minutes past and had them auto complete on me
---
Go to the Thorn in cranberry bog. Check inside tent - jump server until one spawns - never takes me more than 2 hops here..
---
Thanks I'll check it out
---
I sell all plans for 1 cap
---
If it was 2x junk people would join when they need to scrap and leave
---
Getting some strong Warhammer 40k vibes from this :)
---
At this point Its safe to assume It will never be fixed
---
I work a full time job as well, make dinner for my family every night and can still get the time, your just making excuses because you don't want to play you want it handed to you.
---
Sounds like you did. Your body is your own and no one has the right to touch it without your permission. Blink twice if you need help.
---
Met my wife in WoW. We‚Äôve moved on with the dumpster fire of BFA, but we‚Äôll be back!

Get PERCEPTIBOBBLE perk
---
I'm like you in that I prefer a "handy-man" generalist type character, as long as it is full health.
---
And ya, I've probably saved 25 or so levels and a few perk packs to boot, but just because I don't know what's going on with Legendary Perks right now and would like to keep options open..
---
They will be complaining for the whole month of August that they don‚Äôt have anything to do and that they‚Äôre bored.
---
Legos under their eyelids
---
I unfortunately cannot support this until bethesda fix the random frame drop around player camps. Losing like 10 fps because some dumbshits' camp is near a high traffic area is unacceptable. Whitesprings camps are grief on sight for that exact reason. If they fix that then by all means, that would be perfect.
---
The only daily I dont like is the level up a perk one.  Now i dont want to level up any perks because it might show up the next day.  Nothing I need for my build, just ones like pack rat or butchers bounty for example.  If its not worth it for you then absolutely stop.  Ill never make it to the end of the season because life shit so i dont stress it.  I get as far as i get.  Though I really wish they let you finish old dailies to catch up.
---
Three on the outside of the building. Don‚Äôt know of any inside. 
---
1: go up the walkways on the right side of the main building until you reach the pipe bridge that runs to the cooling towers. Follow the pipe bridge to the left most cooling tower. You‚Äôll find a skeleton, aid box, pipe rifle. A bobble head spawns between the skeleton and aid box. 
---
2: continue up the building to the roof and follow it west. You‚Äôll find a conveyer belt that runs from the main building over to an unused cooling tower on top of a concrete building. You‚Äôll need marsupial or a jet pack to hop over the large pipes on the right side of the building that run to the base of the cooling tower. Behind those pipes you‚Äôll find another skeleton, a cooler (sometimes has ammo, aid, food, beverages, chems, and occasionally plans), a bunch of chems on the floor around the cooler, a capstash and also a bobble head. 
---
3: from there head back to the main building roof and go all the way to top, follow all the walkways up as far as they go, and you‚Äôll find a red steamer trunk (which usually has plans, gunpowder and various scraps), a low level minigun, ammo box, and another bobble head. 
---
Keep in mind these are not guaranteed spawns. They are the definite spawn locations, but they‚Äôre not definitely going to be there every time. But for three in one location, if the challenge is to find one, you‚Äôre chances are tripled.
---
Yea it's a glitch
---
Also with the secret service helmet costing so much gold it should have extra protection benefits as well as being able to attach mods to it.
---
I could use some jet
---
So any drug, drink, or food buff stops. I loose health no matter what? All of them?
---
Bruh, how are they not all dead from a plague. Like literally no sense of sanitation for someobe with a settlement. At least the Blood Eagles and Cultists put their dead bodies AWAY from their canteen area.
---
If I remember correctly it‚Äôs only the top tier ones that have the red underarm. I have the elder on my t60. Paladin and officer real close to elder. Elder has the cleaner look.
---
It's frustrating as hell, but since Beth has been quite on this one, you can get rid of healing factor mutation and the issue goes away (at least it did for me and many others)
---
I had a friend who got a 3 star from either a 2 star legendary or a one star while we were hunting gouls in white springs and we were all like ‚Äòwhat? So not fair‚Äô. The rest of us got one stars.
---
Found one at Sons of Dane under the stairs.
---
Cool thanks!
---
There's a happy medium between the 5 minute 'fungi' challenge and the potentially +1 hr '3 legendary' challenge. I only have a couple hours a day to play, half of that is spent server hopping looking for events to get legendaries.
---
I just realized you are the NukaCrypt guy! That's just awesome. Thank you for all that you do.
---
I think you are mistaking ‚Äúeasy‚Äù with ‚Äúguaranteed.‚Äù I only play NW enough to fulfill the SCORE challenge. If the challenge is ‚Äúsurvive NW for 30‚Äù then this challenge is guaranteed. It might take a few attempts, but you will eventually reach it. The ones that people complain about are situational. Ex: Kill 6 creatures. I have played plenty in NW now and it is not even guaranteed that you will come across 1 creature per match. Or, revive a downed player. I have revived others before but it is not something that happens every match. Especially since many use a downed player as a bait tactic. People who do not situational challenges but ones that are obtainable.
---
I've only noticed it with food buffs or anything relating to endurance.
---
So something fun, the rr garage will mesh into concrete foundations.
---
Haha people without gun rights wanting guns nerfed
---
Lol so dramatic. Wasn‚Äôt anything approaching half and they‚Äôre all basically back.
---
I rolled an alt to get the other Wastelanders achievement and decided to go with the pipe revolver rifle build. I haven‚Äôt found a legendary one yet, but it has been fun. I am still one shorting most things.
---
Rip bangles the moon monkey

Not sure but it sounds like a fallout setting. I‚Äôm on Xbox so I‚Äôm not 100%...Bring up your map and then whichever button it is to bring up the menu, go down to settings, audio and then voice chat mode
---
There‚Äôs a post somewhere on reddit where one player commented all the places he knew the briefcase to show up. They‚Äôre specific places.
---
Edit: just found this: https://dan-parker.github.io/YASSM-NW/
---
That's closer to answer than I have gotten before. Like I said I read about the well fed bonus doing it so I stay hungry. But I don't always follow that, I'll pay more attention to buffs relating to endurance as I like those because as we all know you don't get that from Unyelding armor. Thank you.
---
Do some workshops in the ash heap common reward there. Otherwise the sturdy and heavy plans are very rare
---
Tbh there should be new character stuff/perks/stats/gameplay/bosses that incentivise a medic build. Like continous raids without supplies from multiple interior cells.
---
From what I've heard nw reports are about worthless
---
I found one with 30 mins left to refresh. I did the Ol‚Äô Western Shuffle quest and it was right there when I exited a room. Glad I got it but shouldn‚Äôt have been so fine consuming. Ironically if I wasn‚Äôt searching for bobblehead would‚Äôve done that quest yesterday.
---
Food and drink buffs
---
For a while though it didn‚Äôt do that and I was excited thinking they did fix it. But nope it started doing it again...
---
I rolled a bloodied Gauss shotgun on one of my characters so though why not?
---
It was another junkies build so it was nice to see what bloodied was like.. 
---
One problem I had was I had a lot of heavy weapons probably 3 or 4 of each type that meant I was carrying a lot of energy ammo, a lot go ballistic and a lot of ultracite.
---
Now that each build has its own weapon type I can fix that 
---
I was saving levels for legendary perks but though this was a better use, still have 10 or so on each character
---
I hope you remember where you parked.
---
How about this...be able to turn snap as well as snap point on and off for any object. And turn off the thing that makes it so you can‚Äôt place an object that intersects...and allow second floors without stairs. And allow second floors to snap to foundations because basements and bi-levels

---
They won't do anything of the sort for you. They will tell you they can't replace the items. The only roll backs that have happened that I am aware of were with the inventory stealing glitch and the massive dupe early on
---
99.9% photomode but I very rarely use any of the filters, textures or frames. I do a bit of editing on some pics; mostly just selective lighting and/or color adjustments or removing a piece of foliage that distracts from the subject etc. Occasionally I'll do more like the radial blur on this one: https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/art/Sheepsquatch-vs-Mirelurk-Queen-840539079

This is what I was trying to do with my modern camp.

Don't worry, our Collectrons are taking care of him for now.
---
The one that isn't a stash box as big as two foundations.
---
They don't do item restorations/rollbacks. The items are gone.
---
You sound disappointed in that lol
---
Well shit all this is going to do is just turn NW into a HvH mode
---
It's an exploit in the game in how you can blueprint the ammo factory generator and then put it down in other camps/workshops.  As far as glitches/exploits go, I find it fairly benign in that ammo isn't exactly hard to come by anyways, especially now with the Raider Ammo generator, collectron bots, and the ammo converter.  I still personally wouldn't do it, as it is an exploit.
---
Blackwater mine and the prison yard?
---
I have about 5k in my vending machine for 1cap each for the same reason. However at 5k the weight is noticeable at 50 lbs of candy.
---
Yeah. Glad I'm over on counsel where we don't have to deal with that shit haha. Would have never made it to 100 over there (Bush wookie life)

You must be ps4 then
---
Did you hear about the Wastelanders content?
---
My cuddles were all consensual and appropriate. Odd you'd immediately think all physical displays of affection/love to a child were somehow sexual or inappropriate.
---
XP boosts stacking helped a lot, At one point I was getting 1k xp per super mutant kill from West Tek between the 2x XP ,4 Lunchboxes, Inspirational, +4 INT boost from buildling team, +25% bonus XP from Cranberry Relish... it all just added up.
---
Specifically which bit?
---
Edit: I'm aware of the new content was just unaware of the double score

The crater could of been the hq for the scavengers in the radiation rumble event. I think that's the event, with scavs in blue hazmat suits and you have to protect them and gather ore. They could have their own quest line, about being an older corporation that the employees took over, and are expanding.
---
Thanks anyways. my gf literally found one 90 seconds after I posted. If you are on XB1 I'll still gladly pay you since you tried to help.
---
And how much they weigh!!
---
Just checking you have the plan to make the non legendary fixer right?
---
Had this same problem last night except I didn‚Äôt use the perk. I went to 15-20 different known locations, none spawned. Went to public, same thing. Said fuck it and went to bed, woke up this morning, hopped onto private and the first spot had a bobblehead for me. It‚Äôs strange.
---
SBQ has NEVER dropped me anything worth a shit. My best drops have been random blood eagles or ghouls....i only do sbq for the reapir kits and a chance at wc. Btw does wc have a chance to drop thw plans for that disgusting wc rug? Cuz i wants.....
---
Dang dude, what are you rolling for your melee build??
---
No. It‚Äôs why am so confused about this. My weight is reading 411/475 which should be fine. I have 16 cores on me &amp; I can only walk like I am over encumbered... it‚Äôs been like that since yesterday. I restarted and still the same today lol
---
I think am try dropping everything and picking it back up and see what happens
---
Yeah the only actual railings that exist in the game are the ugly wood slats. I was disappointed to find I couldn‚Äôt use them other places.
---
Then what would you do if you want to join and help a friend that is in the middle of something (ie silo run, event) and your camp spot is taken? The game doesn't know if the spot is free until your data is loaded on to the server.
---
I'm at 89 a lot of grinding but the prizes don't seem worth it i just want that fireplace hidden door.
---
Well, the game already punishes the camp glitchers.
---
The ammo workshop permanently feed on camp budget and the "somebody bought my items from my stash" bug mostly happened whos camp budget was over the maximum limit... so... I cant wait when glitchers will come to cry a river when the next bug will punish them.
---
Exactly!
---
This is a cry that will go unheard. Bethesda has never cared about building as much as they do updating the atomic shop frequently. From playing since beta to today, they‚Äôve barely touched building except add more shit. It‚Äôs depressing because building is what keeps me playing.
---
Level up is usually 500, the rest are 250. This weekend they‚Äôre all doubled.
---
I'm with you man.  The amount of time they expect people to put into this thing not only in hours but days logged in, is crazy for what you get in return.  It's a system clearly meant to inflate player engagement numbers in return for a bunch of slight alterations on skins we already have, and (some of it broken) deco.  That's what 3 logging in daily and potentially 200+ hours gets you.    
---
I really don't get why people are so against any criticism of this system.  This is the games great potential just slowly  (or not so slowly) fading away.
---
I have a large collection armor plans - IIRC, I earned that badge, so I might have the ones you seek in my stash.  If I do, they will be a lot less caps than you cite.
---
PS4,  I‚Äôll be on some time this afternoon, after 12.30p
---
aj ninetyeight
---
If your on Xbox go to the dash board and close app. Otherwise you get a few errors trying to get back on. Due to it only going into rest mode and never fully turning off. 
---
PS4 has been fine at least on my end. I completely turn off the system. Do not put into rest mode. 
---
Source: I own and play on both.
---
*Laughs in Todd Howard*
---
I must have missed the announcement.  Thanks for the heads up
---
It should.  It really should.
---
Really weird...
---
Yeah.. get out and try like,  strip all the armor and core out of the frame, recall the frame, place it back and put all the parts and core back on. Maybe that will jarr whatever's bugged out
---
For real dude.....there are legendary enemies literally everywhere....i usually finish that one by default just doing the other challenges.....some of yall are some of the biggest whiners ive ever seen in a sub, holy shit.
---
YES.
---
That voice. UUUUUGH. Quests are quests, but that voice is just grating. Cannot stand "ROSE".
---
Any way to kill Rose? I just avoid her once done with her. \*\*\*shudder\*\*\*
---
You mean the one that's in the ammo factory or the Armco one from the raiders quest?
---
Haha. I like the way you speak.
---
Everyone was opening lunchboxes that weekend, that's why.
---
Haven't seen very many lunchboxes being opened since.
---
Anywhere with higher level Scorched, they often drop them.
---
Honestly gotta say the fo76 ingame community might be the friendliest community of any game I've played. Personally I **love** when friendly players are the majority and unfriendlies are few and far between.
---
I wish I could find more servers like that in Rust. That game plays soooo much better when raiders / bandits are a heavy minority.
---
Xbox ? lvl 38 new to game been searching for plans.
---
I've been meaning to look into it closer. I've just waited 5 minutes for something to run out and it made no change so there's obviously more to it than just food buffs. Not sure though, needs some science.
---
This.
---
No it looks like a resource collecter and it's in my base
---
But that would have taken the devs extra time and the dev-side PM obviously decided it wasn‚Äôt worth the effort to reduce the amount of unnecessary tickets support would get inevitably.
---
I never said scale the game to that power level, I said ADD IN challenges at that power level.  Like, uh, end game content.  Imagine that.
---
The bug only happened with me once, at the 3rd day. I was online at reset time and I was at the map.
---
After that I always log out, fully, I even close fully the Bethesda app.
---
Now I hope I wont jinx my luck...
---
The objectives are easy when they don't auto complete. Work 60 hours a week to log on last night with every single daily done on double score weekend. Canceled fallout first and uninstalled. To many bugs in this game to keep paying them to waste mybtime. Rdr2 has an update anyway.
---
Camp budget needs a 50% increase anyway.. I'd prefer double, but eh..
---
That makes sense
---
Here's the thing - one of the major incentive to play the season pass is the ultra rare beer stein you get at the end. There's only one reason to get it - to display it and show it off. If we can't do that, then the incentive to complete the season pass isn't there - and BGS is leaving money on the table.
---
FOMO is conditioning. The structure of the Legendary Run is designed for people that are succeptible to FOMO.
---
Enjoy a ban. :)
---
That's a glitch that's not supposed to be possible.
---
That‚Äôs an exploit. Nobody can say if it will absolutely get you banned or not but I wouldn‚Äôt risk it.
---
Thanks !
---
You won't be banned.  You just lost 2% of your camps budget permanently. You can't delete the machine and if you move your camp it becomes an invisible blueprint. I hope you like your location and base as is lol.
---
Well i don't think it's a bannable offence bu it's definitely not meant to be there
---
Dev incompetence or cheap-as-possible product management?
---
They could add like other games (I mean this isn't a true MMO) it's 50 slotted servers, just add a browser with filters.
---
Friends.
---
C.A.M.P.
---
Ping.
---
Etc
---
All you can do is block the players ign so you don‚Äôt end up in a game with them again. I do this probably every 3rd game on pc.
---
I'm a good guy too -  except i do shoot a lot of things to death. But, I don't trust the settlers - I think ward is dishonest and as long as Meg is leading the raiders, I think they are all bark no bite (no worse than my bite anyway) and she is inclusive and welcoming of misfits. Having maxed out both, I think Meg's raiders are the better guys philosophically.
---
1 to 2, not much. 1 to 3, huge difference. Every time you kiss a shot your chances to hit increase, that increase is much quicker with 3 points.
---
Some of us enjoy building in this game, that doesn't make us "dumbshits". Your FPS isn't somehow more important than their enjoyment of the game. This makes you sound entitled AF.
---
Yeah you will get banned for that if they catch you, it‚Äôs not there legitimately
---
Anyone else have Ward constantly mumbling how ‚Äúwe couldn‚Äôve used those detonators to build a well in another community, but I understand you had your reasons.‚Äù  He constantly glitches back into this.
---
This is what I did, just at a different location.  
---
Took about 10 hops.
---
FO76 has the same problem FO4 had with one handed weapons, they're just inferior versions of two handed weapons and their perks are near identical. Why would I use a revolver when a rifle does everything better? Why would I use a sword when a sledgehammer does everything better?
---
The solution to this would be dual wielding. There's no reason for the engine to not have it. One melee and one pistol or two one handed melee or two pistols would be awesome. [It would also allow me to role play Danny DeVito.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHzw4QvE2Do)
---
Sucks, man. I almost always find at least one when I go through the place.
---
Yeah, I hit lvl 75 in Score and used my spare atoms to complete it
---
You most likely have a bugged core in the PA, it's rare but can happen. Dump it and try another one.
---
Then you‚Äôll have to adapt. I‚Äôm sure there are literally thousands of players that are or were in similar situations. 
---
Personally I‚Äôd have no problem of the reset time moved forward 2 hours each month, to be as balanced as possible for everyone.
---
This game is has so much potential that is absolutely strangled by a seemingly lack of imagination and cheap af corporate resourcing.
---
I had a long diatribe but this is easier now you can get some learnin. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.yesmagazine.org/economy/2015/05/20/is-west-virginia-s-coal-history-a-goldmine-mine-wars&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiA9O3K1-jqAhXjdN8KHWyBDLAQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw21n1he4lqNwDstCym65SQc
---
It's not bannable afaik but you permanently loss 2% of your camp budget for each one placed. You can't remove them and they become invisible blueprints if you move camp.
---
They‚Äôre reaching EA levels of greediness. It started when Creation Club came out. They lost focus on quality and started focusing on profit. 
---
Which is ironic. If they would‚Äôve focused on quality and a pipeline of content, they really wouldn‚Äôt have a problem making money or keeping their player base. But instead, they got it backwards. 
---
‚ÄúHmm... how do we make money on a dwindling player base game? Oh I know! Let‚Äôs feed them useless skins and walls for their imaginary houses! Great idea!‚Äù 
---
If they pull this off again for the next Fallout, I think it‚Äôs safe to say I will drop the entire franchise because it has veered off track for too long. 
---
That beer stein is pretty dope tho, kinda shitty you can‚Äôt really implement it anywhere in your camp the right away. Ah, good ol‚Äô Bugthesda.
---
In addition to what others said, leveling becomes harder with each level up. So if you leveled lets say 50-100 levels last weekend you will need quite abit more xp to level up now.
---
Leader of the pack is the key to the three legos. I do it every time I see it, which is frequent, and maybe 1 out of 5 times another player will also be participating. Takes maybe 10 mins.
---
Oh I know all about special bullets. Sold my friend a limited edition .38 for 950 caps. Best deal I‚Äôve ever made.
---
The weight limit of max weight + 1500 lbs was implemented after one of the duping incidents a long time ago. 
---
I‚Äôm sure the not being able to fast travel while over weight comes from another fallout game, the specific weight caps I was speaking about came from this game
---
[link to January 2019 article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/gamerant.com/fallout-76-patch-weight-limit/amp/)
---
I have 1,600+ hours and have been looking for this answer all along. No one knows for sure ( Maybe the Turtle knows ) and everyone I have asked has none provable theories. 
---
In the end nothing is very consistent on this game so it is what is I guess.
---
Wow, I didn‚Äôt know that was the issue.
---
For letting me know! I‚Äôll try that!!
---
&gt;	BGS is leaving money on the table.
---
This both does and doesn‚Äôt get said nearly enough. 
---
Wasted potential all over the place
---
Nice to see im not the only one who buys three 1 cap ammo items for the Daily. I was actually kinda worried I was pissing the vendor/player off by just giving up 3 measly caps and then leaving.
---
Knowing how to employ stealth is a tactic!
---
I 100% crowch walk, wear my brown wastelander outfit (instead of obnoxious orange armour), and play in 3rd person with my weapon not drawn (I become the bush or tree!)
---
When it comes down to me and the final other player I'm like a rattle snake waiting to pounce. As soon as they run past my bush I equip my sledge hammer and strike before they realize what hit them.
---
(I'm horrible at PvP, so this is my only tactic to win matches)
---
The way it should always have been is a 1 star legendary enemy drops a 1 star item, a 2 star enemy drops a 2 star item and a 3 star enemy drops a 3 star item. 
---
Or everything above but a 3 star enemy had a 50/50 chance to drop a 2 star or 3 star item.
---
I throw all the ammo I don't use in there for free. Even missiles and mini nukes.
---
Ooh this sounds smart. Here I thought friending them so you can follow them to adventure mode to grief them was a better solution.
---
Yes. That‚Äôs exactly what it was I had drop all the cores that were on me. Thank you, appreciate it!
---
Regardless of whether or not you get a ban (honestly I doubt it), i hear it screws up your camp budget, so enjoy that.
---
I also heard you can't scrap them? Since you have one maybe you could guinea pig that for me as i'm curious.
---
You may have noticed very few in the last day or so as everyone was hunting them down for score challenges.
---
And as far as I heard, it permanently burns the camp budget. After you put it down, you can not scrap it or store it and if you move your camp, it will wanish, but it still eats on camp budget.
---
Yeah guess I'm staying at white springs. I'm happy with it tho
---
From what I‚Äôve noticed, if your health is regenerating or if you healed recently, you can‚Äôt fast travel while your health is moving. Hence healing factor being an issue. If you wait to fast travel until after your health is through regenerating, shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Personally I‚Äôve noticed putting away my weapon seems to help to, maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence
---
Also, if you plan to put any turrets on the ground, lay a rug down first and put the turret on the rug for this exact reason (so if it bugs and disappears you can store the rug and your turret will be stored too)
---
I try to put on the revive perks to give the downed a boost. 
---
Accidentally had Healing Hands on once very early on tho and it haunts me to this day how many bloodied players I may have F‚Äôd during that Queen Fight lol
---
I have the plan for heavy robot legs.  I‚Äôd is GODISALIVE7_7_7
---
You can buy as many as you want, but I‚Äôd say wait until closer to the end. Even without regular effort you‚Äôll certainly progress quite a few ranks.
---
I consider it payment for all the times Bethesda DC me when I took over workbenches
---
I'm aware. And I do what I can do. And like I said that wasn't the main point of my post at all. 100% not excepting any change or sympathy. That was just a little rant on my end. 
---
I just wanted to know of we had gotten any word from Bethesda.
---
Well it‚Äôs the same spot I use ever since I started playing the game, I never changed it. So I‚Äôm not too worried about that. But I‚Äôm glad I won‚Äôt get banned because I seriously didn‚Äôt know it was an exploit
---
It rarely takes me more than 15 minutes to finish nearly all the daily challenges aside from level up....
---
Don't know what you people are going on about.
---
The issue is, with how much budget displays chew up - a 50% increase to camp size will be negligible if BGS can't get a hold on the display case issue.
---
I can understand why Weapon Displays chew up so much camp budget because of the sheer amount of stats that need to be kept in memory about the item (legendary effects, mods, ammo, condition etc).  But why do aid items like magazines and bobbleheads take up the same amount of budget? Why do apparel items like Fasnacht masks? Or Junk items like the aforementioned Beer Steins, but also Teddies and Mr Fuzzies?
---
My dailies auto completing yesterday and losing me 5k score had the opposite effect 
---
, I canceled my fallout first and uninstalled this game after 900 hours of putting up with LOTS of broken features. I'm done wasting my time with this mess.
---
Perma?
---
I do this all the time but hate how long it takes to start the animation. 
---
The other player is already zipping away while I‚Äôm pouring one out for them
---
Though I agree that it's sorta an exploit and shouldn't be possible, however if it's possible and there's no rule saying you cannot do that.. then there's no reason to receive a ban. It's just the flaw that they need to fix and thus prevent this from happening.
---
I don't know, I have a whole two lane road in the middle of my camp, I can use a corvega or two
---
Completing the mission isn't a priority.  I usually shoot all the scavengers before the mission starts for extra value.
---
Title. Post for tagging /u/Ladydevann
---
Agreed. 
---
I mean take a workshop.... Build 5 things....mod armour 5 times.....join a group ...use photo mode in a group...
---
Literally most days it's 10-15 minutes to finish most of any given days dailies.
---
I need steel and lead for my gauss shotgun. For lead the best sites are the three nuclear sites. Once every day you get 78 each. Green country lodge in flatwoods, Charleston fire department, vault tec university and top monorail elevator. For steel the easiest way is to do the super mutant tour: Hunsterville, West tech research, national isolated radio array, lots of weapons that give 19 steel each. Always use perk scrap. Another alternative is to buy. Steel is quite cheap at vendors.
---
Not the best challenge but get over it, it wasn‚Äôt a rant it was a winge.
---
Comment 1. You don‚Äôt need to do ‚Äúresearch‚Äù but you can load a map to make it easier.
---
Comment 2. It‚Äôs one perk, one level if you actually have to buy it and didn‚Äôt get one in one of the perk packs.
---
Comment 3. You could instead invest the time farming XP, to make up for the loss of the 500 points, that‚Äôs what I do with the NW challenges I don‚Äôt want to complete or don‚Äôt seem worth the time.
---
Comment 4. So someone makes a comment and you say bully for you no one cares, maybe everyone else feels the same about your little ‚Äúrant‚Äù.
---
That is a good point, because when I put on the Chinese Stealth Suit, I sacrifice something like 60 Carry Weight, which is a substantial blow at the end of the day.  But being high level and with a fair bit of native Strength, I've also collected (mostly from the random Perk Card packs) weight reduction perks like Sturdy Frame, Bandolier, Bear Arms, and Strong Back that I can toss on since dealing a ton of damage doesn't really matter in Radiation Rumble.
---
Now, if you didn't have the Strength, that would be a problem because there is really isn't another way to absorb that loss of Carry Weight.
---
It's been a bug since the middle of last year. They fixed it for melee weapons but ignored it for unarmed. The only possible secondary/tertiary rolls are any combination of swing speed, limb damage, weight reduction, and +agility. All primary effects are still obtainable
---
This is great, are you using an ENB or anything? It looks sharper than vanilla!
---
People dupe because the RNG suck.
---
I've had both happened I got a 2 stars legendary from a 1 star legendary
---
Same idea applies, if you bring the rest of the gear to bloodied's level and then create content around that level of power the same outcome applies.
---
Jumbo Mr Fuzzy ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Fair enough, when you just said "the weight thing" I assumed of course you meant the same weight thing as in the title.  You're right about that other one though.
---
None that I‚Äôm aware of.
---
I always log out to desktop 10-15 minutes before the challenges switch for the day without doing any of the other steps and then wait another 10-15 minutes after the switch before logging in just to be extra safe and have never had the bug. Hopefully doing that can help some other people avoid it.
---
No problem, glad it worked. :)
---
The worst part is spending 1.7k caps on those keycards, tanking the pylons and dealing metric damage to the Imposter and getting a rolling pin or a one star revolver. 
---
Multiple times.
---
I think he‚Äôs being a smart ass. LOL
---
Huh???
---
It works out of vats... watch: [https://streamable.com/dwmz0j](https://streamable.com/dwmz0j)
---
(wonderful find in a player vendor for around 1000 caps btw Stalkers 25 90 LMG :) )
---

---
Yeah you won't find a lot of agreement in this sub. Most of the people playing this game are the typical MMO players with loads of free time on their hands. I find it really hard to commit an hour to this game every day with all the yknow.. adult stuff I need to do. Just today I spent about half an hour just looking for the stupid bobblehead and every location I checked none were there. I only have that hour or so to play so I never even got the 5 dailies reward because of that poorly thought out bobblehead challenge
---
Well, I just let a couple of food buffs run out to no change. The well fed bonus does have an effect but as it alters you hp that stands to reason. I suspect it is down to anything that alters hp or endurance. I have it happen when in groups a lot. I think it's because herd mentality recalculates every time someone leaves or enters the group even though the buff is the same.
---
But yeah, it is what it is lol.
---
We should be able to select what we auto-scrap or not, l will never want Mole Rat teeth.
---
61 myself
---
The animation takes forever, same with putting a fusion core as well
---
Hit 59 today
---
You gotta offer Grandma favors or she'll never give you anything but missile launchers and pipe pistols.
---
It's bonus, free additions to the game to keep people playing.  Also, you don't "deserve" any of the rewards. You can earn them through play or move on. No one promised you you'd get them all. Take what you get and be happy with it. 
---
Talk about a selfish, entitled attitude; "I don't have time to earn the stuff so they're wrong because they didn't cater their special, free addition directly to me." Grow up. The top tier prizes are there to reward the dedicated players. If you only make it to level 40 then that's still 40 prizes you got, free. Just because it has 100 levels doesn't mean you're entitled to all 100.
---
Por que no lo dos?
---
Except it's wrong, redneck was already recognized as a slur by the turn of the century. The use of red bandannas by labor movements was utilizing this already existing term to draw together workers of disparate identities, since for example darker-skinned black people can't literally be rednecks (Edit: I suppose pretty much *no* miner is a literal redneck bring down in the dark all day, but by that point it was already entrenched as a slur for poor workers from the region).
---
That may have been an important moment in the definition of the reneck identity, so I'm probably being a bit pedantic here, but it's 100% *not* the origin.
---
Edit: [This article](https://slate.com/culture/2019/12/redneck-origin-definition-union-uprising-south.html) cites an 1890 dictionary, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1itI6DB5GQ) claims it's all the way from the 1600s?
---
Duel wielding would also be cool. But I feel like it could become super overpowered if both weapons can do the same damage. Maybe if they add like an offhand type weapon for duel wield, like where it would have some other effect.  Such as if used it doesn't do too much damage but stumbles the target so while stumbled they can't shoot or attack.
---
Ya you would
---
I just logged in. No auto complete
---
Oh and I‚Äôm 55
---
It's kind of a chicken-and-egg problem to me.
---
When people can go off and order whatever Legendaries they want, they have no interest visiting player shops that sell second-rate Legendaries.  And if no one buys, the shops stop putting the good stuff out there.
---
That, and as TrippyPanda points out, the RNG sucks.  It sucks for everyone.  And frankly, it's difficult to compete with dupers flooding the market with gear you could never acquire yourself through legitimate means.
---
Appreciate the testing. We need to get Angry Turtle to test answer this.
---
on PC I just hit escape.. not sure what a console would use as the escape key...
---
While I dont necessarily support duping, the rng in this game IS atrocious so I see why people do it.
---
Always log before
---
What I'm wondering is if any legendary enemy can drop any items. Can a legendary ghoul drop a legendary gauss rifle? The only legendary gauss rifle I ever found was on a lvl 70+ floater found in that forest south west of the SBQ spawn ... I have yet to find any lever rifle, though.
---
So many handmade skins and only half of them are fully functional. Scabber and matte black. The communist one sort of works, I assume the communist one staying largely the same despite attachments is intended, but you never know in this game. Gold is borked, blood eagle is borked, the patriot one is REALLY borked. You'd think somebody would take 30 seconds to test it before putting it up for sale
---
What does Guinea pig it for you mean
---
And I've got part of a two-lane road in mine. You just asked "what would be an insta-buy", and I answered.
---
Did you mean "what would most people insta-buy"? In that case, I still figure the smaller car is gonna be more popular than the bigger one. You'd have to find some other functionality for a Corvega, because a two-foundation-wide stash box ain't it. So from what I've seen in the Atom Shop, it would likely be either a planter or a grill, which means it's not being repaired as a vehicle. Do you want a grill in the middle of your road?
---
I think an option to play solos where everyone is on their own would be largely welcomed. Like every other major BR game...
---
People dupe because they suck.
---
True, I need ammo but I won't risk this. If you do, it's best to put it in a workshop and not your camp. You can't remove it.
---
I'd like to make my camps in convenient places for fast travelling or easy farming from spots I know. I also don't want to be a selfish inbred so I build my shit practically in the middle of nowhere. Build elsewhere if you didn't want your shit to get destroyed.
---
Gotta agree. Today I took one out all by myself-- well, if "luring it out of the forest where it could be hammered by scorchbeasts, robots, anti-aircraft artillery, and my own weapons" counts as "by myself," well, I did it. It daid, I got rewards.   
---
I was hoping it'd give me some kind of special reward, a level up, maybe a special accomplishment thing. Nope. Only thing I got was a vocal sac, which \_might\_ be worth selling or for some future weapon that's not in the game yet.
---
I think with the legendary run there's alot of people neglecting camp maintenance and vendoring to I stead focus on grinding XP.
---
I use to always make sure my vendors were full, and I went out of my way to have cool stuff, rarer outfits, and a wide selection of items because it was a fun downtime activity.
---
These days I might restock my vendor every other day if I'm low on stash space and have a bunch of legendaries I want to sell.
---
The game has a lot of core problems - these duper‚Äôs are the vast majority of the players.
---
Tbh, did you think this broken a game had a large player base because people liked the faulty play, the endless garbage grinds, or dealing with horrible mechanics like these weight limitations, or being screwed over by the pay to plAy ?
---
These people were playing to earn cold hard cash by selling these dupes - now with them driven off, the games finally going to go into free fall mode.
---
Don't dupe and you won't get banned.
---
Yeah I agree. If they fix it and make good weapons more obtainable, I‚Äôm sure there will be less duping. There will still be duping of course, but just less
---
Good resource. I still enjoy exploring and foot slogging but this is just what I need for specifics. It‚Äôll be interesting to see where it goes. Put in the thing you want and it‚Äôll bring up the ingredients locations and a travelling salesman route.
---
He wants you to try removing it from your camp, which you cannot do. You're stuck with it forever now and if you move your camp it will be a ghost item in your storage that you can't place again or delete but still takes up a chunk of your budget. RIP.
---
That could be cool as I don't see people use pistols much. For balance I figured you couldn't shoot while blocking maybe.
---
Hope I‚Äôm never in your server for that event then!!
---
It wouldn't help much considering their lower damage output. I'd imagine dual pistols have higher burst DPS than rifles, but slower reload and inferior initial damage.
---
As for melee, it would involve different attack animations which could be sped up and slowed down to make it balanced with two handed melee.
---
I know that feeling. Killed the in game music and heard nothing where ever I went. I had to jump servers twice before finally hearing some strange sound then finding a bobble head at the house near the giant teapot
---
34 :(
---
Probably didn't know any better
---
I wish I could shoot in 3rd person but I play 1st person so much in adventure I‚Äôm stuck using it
---
World Challenge says: revived downed players 39... No way, lvl 554 and every queen of encryptid event i easylie revive a player or 2 (average)
---
Except that nerfs always have a far more negative impact on the community than buffs.
---
Yesterday I logged back in 30 mins after the reset and I was at 7/9. At this point, I'm sure I won't be able to catch up to the bad guy on the board without spending atoms which I won't do.
---
might be why people use it more often at other workshops
---
Well I never even seen anything like this, nor did it myself.
---
you know you dont get double what is shown.. they doubled the reward itself?
---
or are you saying youre getting 250?
---
‚òëÔ∏è Option C - All of the Above
---
  I have glowsight maxed and a FSS ghoul slayers switchblade. It base stat is 93 damage.
---
Perhaps this will help:
---
I am a melee build, 15 str, incisor, martial artist. Twisted muscles.
---
 I dont remember if i have slugger, if I do, its only 1 
---
Unaltered by chems/food/bobbles/magazines, using standard swings, not power attacks, that switchblade will 1hit L42 charred ghouls, L62s take 2 hits to bring them down to just a sliver of life.
---
Bloated glowing ones are 3-4 hits to kill.
---
Comparatively, My vampire switchblade has similar base damage, but is a bit slower, and takes an additional hit per critter to kill it.
---
How many BoS PA paints are there?
---
I dont think level on hazmat suits would matter. I could be wrong though
---
500 score is already double the 250 you normally get, the bonus is already added on not extra on top.
---
83, grinded almost to the point of where I couldn't even look at another super mutant or ghoul
---
Taking advantage of an exploit is against the toa, don't know if he'll get banned or not but there is definitely a rule saying to not take advantage of exploits
---
This nailed me a few hours before reset this morning. I‚Äôm hearing not to log out from Nuclear Winter, and not to log in to anything (including the shop) except adventure before you see the daily challenges.
---
Incredibly frustrating to lose 4500 score at the start of a weekend.
---
Yeah it seems for me bethesda is just going on fortnite direction with cosmetics cause that is what sells the best. If you want to attract such playerbase somehow you have to give them those kind of items. Fortnite is making tons of.money on those cosmetics.
---
Pretty sure it's been like that since it came out. And the nuka girl outfit was one of the first ever atom shop items. I almost want to say it's even been there since launch but can't remember for sure
---
If you just stay at the terminal with it active couldn't you prevent this from happening? No one else could use it to start the event.
---
After receiving like 50 trash 3 star items I finally got the 3 star fixer but it was with meh perks so I sold it. If I got one I would gladly trade it with you.
---
I'll kind of push back on some of those things - base building and camp building was my favorite part of Fallout 4 and is now one of my favorite things to do in 76. Giving us new stuff for camps is great! And if these "content packs" are paid so that the DLC and story-based stuff is free, then I'm happy. I much prefer this to the WoW model where you have to shell out more money periodically if you want to continue the story. 
---
At the end of the day, Bethesda isn't Amazon. They're not sitting on a massive server farm that they can host this game on. Fallout 76 is on servers that Bethesda is leasing from someone else- which means the game has to make x amount of dollars per month to just pay for itself. That doesn't include staff costs and overhead that Bethesda has on its own end. The reality is that there are monthly expenditures surrounding this game that we have to accept. 
---
The alternative is making everyone buy Fallout First to continue playing - which I don't think anybody wants. But the money has to come from somewhere - and if the story packs are free, and there is no subscription fee, then the Atomic Shop is here to stay.
---
I would give you an upvote but ur already at the magic number "76" so take an award instead üòã
---
My Man!!
---
You clearly have it backwards. He wants 1 stars to drop only 1 stars. 2 stars only drop 2 stars, and 3 stars only drop 3 stars. Nowhere did OP say they wanted 1 star creatures to drop 3 star items.
---
They are upset that farming 3 star creatures frequently results in only 1 star or 2 star items, and not enough times with 3 star items.
---
Do line in the sand. You'll get 7 or 8 easily
---
Free items don‚Äôt seem to count towards the challenge.
---
I've been on the phone with Microsoft for my refund.  That's another cluster bomb of incompetence there.
---
Yes it‚Äôs good mod. If anyone needs help with mods just ask. I‚Äôve met a few people who don‚Äôt use them for that reasons alone. There are some amazing mods out there.
---
Doors should also be universal
---
Thank you! I'm currently using a very subtle Reshade (ENBs are not available for 76 yet) which you can find here: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/662?
---
Just look for ammo at the shop, mostly 1 cap prices.
---
it basically boils down to bigger durability meter
---
9 for me
---
Way too many people to ever make any generalizations. I've met plenty of morons, toxic individuals, or asshats both here and in-game. Also met some decent people. People making posts about a "welcoming community" are not referencing the entire community, but a handful of nice people they encountered
---
I think Bethesda should go after these people, or at least send a notice to eBay to remove the listings.  
---
Most of those sellers make a ton of money and it's actually taking revenue from Bethesda.
---
I agree, all I'm saying is that the developers should make it impossible to use exploits in the first place instead of just make a poor job and then forbidding it by rules instead of fixing it and making sure that nobody would use it.
---
Yes sir I do
---
 I never thought about that, appreciate the tip
---
Only time it happened to me was the only time I was logged at reset.
---
Been doing the same as you ever since, no proof that it is related but oh well a person needs to try...
---
If we can clip display power armour and the lunchboxes there‚Äôs no good reason why we can‚Äôt display the giddy up butter cups other then they were gonna try to atom shop it
---
Are you going into danger more than you want?
---
This comment has made me oddly excited about jumping online to play NW haha. This is my strategy to a T, down to the top ten finish. I don't even aim for first üòÇ
---
The carry weight differential between armor and PA can be significant.
---
With 5 pieces of deep pocketed WR armor, a high capacity backpack, and a couple of stacked WR perks, I gain over 300# when I have to get into PA.
---
I‚Äôm convinced the issues we have on servers, drop rates and weird glitches are all because the servers run different software versions. I‚Äôll wager they even deploy experimental versions to fix glitches on public servers just to see how they function in the wild.
---
IMO best solution would be to make ALL junk autoscrap. but allow us the player 20 slots to mark junk items as non-autoscrap
---
Depends on what you're sneaking against.
---
Like, personally, if I'm going to be doing melee against the SBQ or hiding from the Imposter Sheepsquatch, I need Sneak.  But if I'm just stalking around Harper's Ferry, I don't.
---
The time-to-kill also matters.  If you get into \[Danger\] because of an enemy, it doesn't really matter if you can immediately put that enemy down in a hit or two.
---
Really, the only answer is to experiment and see what works for you.  This is true of a lot of things.  You may just find out that their effects are more of a placebo than anything.
---
Sell it to a vendor or drink it.
---
thats what i need
---
Goddamnit. I was excited for that the most.
---
Was really hoping it would be like the cow.
---
Yeah this is a pretty good point.
---
Hahahahaha
---
If you have trouble finding them I recomend you use https://fo76map.com to find places where many bobbleheads spawn.
---
Can definitely back that theory up, I always have placed myself at my camp before logging out, and I have never experienced the auto complete bug.
---
&gt; clip display power armour
---
What's this about? I've never heard of a way to display power armor. It would be nice to show off the useless Old Man Winter PA helmet I got.
---
nope, multiple people can be on the same terminal. they just connect via their pip-boy
---
Well my entire point is, if they would stop, and focus on quality of their game, they wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about keeping a steady stream of income. 
---
It takes months before they even update anything. I‚Äôm all for the cool items and stuff in the atomic shop, but there is literally no incentive to buy these things to show them off to an already dwindling player base. What good is it if you can‚Äôt really show it off? 
---
I would much rather them focus on adding a huge pipeline of content, dedicated developers to clear out bugs and add more features and ideas in fo76. 
---
This game has a HUGE potential to be something so much bigger and Bugthesda skewed it. Big time. 
---
Why do you think CD Projekt Red has postponed Cyberpunk 2077 like 4 times now? Because they don‚Äôt want what happened to Fo76, to happen to them. Why? Because they‚Äôre a studio who focuses on quality and content, rather than trying to stick their hands into your wallet. 
---
This EA level of greediness will build over time to the point where nobody will trust Bethesda again.
---
I remember back in the good ol days... where corporations actually cared about what their player base wanted and pushed quality content rather than cash grabs... makes me sad.
---
P.S : To see the same studio who made Skyrim, failing at Fallout is humiliating for Bethesda. Just shows to prove Obsidian had the right ideas for Fallout.
---
I feel you.
---
I accidentally scripped the Furious gauss minigun I got on my first, second, or third roll, when I was scripping the lousy rolls.
---
Went and got the skin right after so it wouldn't happen again.
---
Wait...You can drink it? I‚Äôve never noticed that. I always just sell it or toss it. Thanks for the info
---
Where is splendid emporium thou speaks of? Dost thou carry the coveted 5.56 ammo? What about .45? If so I shall come hither.
---
Can it be sold?  That would be great
---
I haven't played in a while. I just do free ammo to help other people out.
---
yes, it only protects you from water radiation.
---
It sucks but log a ticket.  Hopefully it helps them and gets you some atoms or something.
---
Pretty convinced that if the grind and RNG wasn‚Äôt so heartless at points - the duping wouldn‚Äôt be such a big issue. 
---
Human beings en masse are like electricity and will always try to find the path of least resistance. 
---
If playing legit wasn‚Äôt as hard as it is to get ‚Äúthe good gear‚Äù - we‚Äôd see a lot less of people burning their mains with glitches and low-hanging dupes.
---
Remember how they released an alien blaster skin despite the weapon being both useless and horrendously bugged?
---
Yeah we could go on all day with such examples
---
No. even if you're on the terminal, they can still access it and start it. It's really annoying.
---
Todd demands you buy it from a third party website using irl currency. /s
---
That or you hope Todd blesses your RNG
---
Killing early Scorchbeasts is always a big deal.  
---
I took a picture of the first one I downed at the Pumpkin House in my Excavator.  
---
Congrats on getting a fun experience out of it.
---
 These features are unlocked after 7600 hours
---
Sadly it only displays the frame/chassis
---
No paints or helmets my friend
---
Considering how the Legendary Run stretches its rewards so thinly in the first place, it's really amazing how flawed many of them are.  Things like this, or the Ghillie pieces floating, the Ammo Convertor being a hot mess, the Future-Tec CAMP module hiding your CAMP, and even then I'm sure I'm missing a few other examples.
---
Imagine if you actually paid your way through this.  It would be such a disappointment.  Aside from it being a total rip-off, half the stuff doesn't even work right.
---
I had this happen to me twice in a row the other day so I went to private world or NW (I don‚Äôt remember which) and that worked then after that adventure worked fine
---
I really don't get why people have such a hard time understanding that they are rewards for players dedicated enough to get them. They were in no way promised to anyone and Bethesda said, long before the legendary run released, that the later ones would take an hour or two to complete. 
---
It's not that "people are so against any criticism of this system" not in any way. What it is is people that are tired of hearing (reading) people complain that they have to, god forbid, play the fucking game to get the rewards. It's this entitled attitude that just because it's in the game that everyone should get it. That is the problem. 
---
The same thing is happening right now in Monster Hunter World/Iceborne. They released Alatreon a few weeks back. Alatreon is one of the fabled Black Dragons. It is a top tier, end game super boss. The game, that is damn near perfect, is getting review bombed because Alatreon is too difficult and requires players to change up their build and tactics to defeat it. It's like people complaining because at level 10 they can't beat the scorched beast queen solo with a pipe pistol.
---
I am in Facebook groups and alot of people that got unbanned kept everything including dupe stuff
---
Tomorrow is another day
---
Once you hit lvl 40, check the Power Plant. I got my 50 there
---
I kinda want this to happen to me I‚Äôve never seen it lol
---
It should. If it's possible to get in that fast, then that's how fast I would always hop into it.
---
Im a space ahead of Dr. Whatshisnutz!  I think 56 or 57.
---
My question is Will It Sink?
---
I believe 7. And one can‚Äôt be learned at the moment. I believe that‚Äôs called initiate paint. It was avail when game came out. I got game after it went away. That‚Äôs the only one I need so hopefully this winter with the brotherhood events coming up they‚Äôll bring it back.
---
My bad, selling got nerfed
---
I‚Äôm unsure my buddy was banned recently for having them, Just second hand knowledge on my part
---
I would recommend wandering around the wasteland. 
---
Every time I feel like moving/remaking my camp I wander around trying to scout locations. Think about what you're looking for while wandering too. Water? Raw mats from an extractor? Do you have a build in mind already or are you going from scratch?
---
I dunno, you could look at it like a different way, and say: "We shouldn't want to just automatically alienate a big slice of the population straight out of the gate.  We should be asking the devs to alter seasons to be more flexible for people with adult schedules.  Otherwise people will likely feel annoyed and possibly just decide to not log on at all.  If it becomes more flexible there's still a time investment but not one you have to clock into every day like a second job. Instead it's something people can to an extent play on their own time, rather than feeling chained to the game's clock.  Everyone wins!  Including me!"    
---
    
---
Instead all we get around here is down voting and name calling anyone who suggests the system could be improved, and a extremely short sighted "I got mine, who cares what other's issues are" attitude.    
---
         
---
To clarify, I'm not saying any of this for myself.  I'm single with few non work responsibilities.  I can sink 2 hours into a video game every night if I want to.  If I want to.  I'm not gonna chain myself to a game that asks me to play every single day for hours.  The only thing I want is the tree, and it won't be hard to get.    
---
I just WANT to like the game overall, and I WANT everyone who plays to feel included in doing anything they WANT to do, and I don't like this mobile game design direction at all.  I think this system is manipulative and fucks over a lot of people, not because they are lazy or entitled but because they only have weekends (or whatever constitutes weekends) open for gaming.    
---
None of this is revolutionary.  Other passes have concessions for this exact reason, because well, it makes sense.
---
it doesnt spawn there anymore, would you be willing to sell yours?
---
If you look at the stars as a skill level then a 3 star would be able to use 1,2 &amp; 3 star equipment. A one star not so much ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
They won‚Äôt be giving out atoms. If they were they would have done it weeks ago. If they can fix the bug they will and that will be it.
---
Daylight savings time I think.
---
If you contact them can you get your account back
---
If you keep missing, you get to a "guaranteed" 95% shot a lot faster with 3 stars.
---
That sucks. How do you display a frame anyway?
---
Yes. You are on a sub dedicated to FO76, of course we'll enjoy and recommend it.
---
Me and my friend both only have 4
---
And don‚Äôt you have to learn them in order or something? I‚Äôve got one of the paint plans but I never learned it just for that reason. Not sure which one it is in the order
---
Yep, lesson learned. I won't leave the terminal screen next time. As I stood in front of it, waiting on my team, he just slipped right past me and started it. I just made the wrong assumption that a player over 100+ would know better or perhaps that was his intention... to ruin it and hope it failed.
---
I have only had it happen once, which was on the second week reset, and lost 4500 score..  Since then I do the following
---
1.  Nuclear winter daily is last
---
2. the character I use for nuclear winter after I finish the challenge, I swap to another character and log in.
---
3. I try not to log in before the second daily reset (first reset is 12:00 eastern, second is 8:00pm eastern (main reset, faction rest)).  This may be overkill, but Im normally not on until after 8 from work anyways.
---
Following these I haven't had it happen again.  I am also never on around the first daily reset, the earliest I am ever on is 6pm, so the challenges auto completing for me had nothing to do with being on near reset.
---
He was, yes
---
Weird, I never saw a single terminal 2 people could use at once while questing with my friend. That's such a bad move if the Encryptid one can.
---
Imo I have a lot of fun with it but also buy it and try for yourself, dont let other people tell you what they think.  Everyone has different experiences than you would.
---
48 or 49. Forgot to check because I spent the last few minutes looking for a bobblehead
---
I‚Äôve never understood this. 
---
Better get yourself steeled for if a real apocalypse happens because - spoiler - your gonna see people running around in a lot worse
---
What ban hammer? They unbanned almost everybody lol
---
Going to hit 57 in a few mins
---
Same as anything else. Just assign a power armor in your stash
---
I know one when I see one, I‚Äôm a pro!!!
---
I hear Barbie Horse Adventures is fucking insane.
---
I was so glad when I completed the Settlers reputation.
---
I'm pretty sure that if we ever have future dealings with these two factions down the road, I'll make sure to turn against Foundation, just to get back at Ward.
---
Just finished yesterday's dailies about an hour ago, damned bobbleheads. With that I'm at rank 56 and change. Should be able to 58 or 59 once I finish today's dailies and my last weekly.
---
I still wouldn't encourage it, on the off chance. We're getting some better perks for stuff sooner or later, so I will keep encouraging trading ammo with friends until they make the ammo agony more bearable.
---
Honest opinion is that while it does have problems and flaws it's an amazing game filled (mostly) with nice people. While the main questline is a bit weak some of the side quests really make up for it. Into the Mystery is simply amazing and my fave quest in the game. Some of the voice acting in this game is A+ and up there with the best i've heard in a game ever. It's also filled with some actual emotional moments if you read/listen to the stuff. Also. Some disturbing moments. 
---
I'm 1220 hours in to it and still love it.
---
Yes I was leveling 115-120 last week and 121 now didn't know it makes that much of a difference
---
You can get them either by buying them thru someone.  Probably at high price. Someone can paint for you or just grind thru the forbidden knowledge quest. Takes awhile to get them plus you get outfits and shielded brotherhood underarmor plan. You‚Äôll want to learn the other brotherhood underarmor plans before. Those you can get at vendor in watoga springs.
---
Haha yeah the game being on steam is a huge reason of why I bought the game in the first place. Never had any customer or billing service problem with them in more than 15 years. Cancelling my F1st subscription was done in 2 clicks.
---
Well... that sux! So much for me trying to block him by staying at the terminal. Terrible flaw Bethesda... but then again, what's new
---
But playing legit isn‚Äôt hard or impossible without those weapons and armor that get most duped. 
---
It‚Äôs more like some players just want the rewards so that the game isn‚Äôt a challenge. They aren‚Äôt buying duped items because they can‚Äôt complete events or kill certain creators. They are buying them before so that doing is easier.
---
That‚Äôs the lie about people buying duped weapons. That without them they can‚Äôt do the events and earn themselves legit.
---
One of the big shortcomings of Wastelanders was the inability to properly react to Paige's condescension.
---
"Okay, well.  I guess I won't help you with the plague then."
---
Four spawn in the cemetery. You can find one at the moonshiners shack and a few of the farms around 76, we've got all these Nuka-Cola flavors, including cranberry! Yet you choose salty..
---
As the little kids say when drawing cemeteries....‚Äùrip‚Äù
---
I just lost my shish ka bob to some bullshit fallout glitch. Like it just disappeared. There is a whole lot happening now that is super glitchy.  Can‚Äôt get out of power armor.  Guns won‚Äôt fire.  Ammo screwed up.  I keep having a thing where it will just stop giving me any xp and I have to log out and back in.  Or the glitch where everything I shoot heals itself and I can‚Äôt kill anything. (No not those dumb headless scorched) That happened during line in the sand and it was just me and one other person.  I felt bad cause I could do nothing to help.  This game needs help.
---
Server hop until you find a nuke zone, go to it, and go from one side to the other, slowly.
---
You can usually get a few respawns, especially around Fissure Prime.
---
Repeat as needed.
---
Run green thumb for double raw flux, and refrigerated backpack or Good With Salt (luck) to keep it good longer.
---
I do all my sneaking and bush wookieing in 3rd person but switch to first when it's time to shoot.
---
Ummm capturing camps is one of the game mechanics.
---
That platinum trophy is bonkers
---
You can look at it any way you want to.  You want it to be exclusionary the way they gave it to you, I want it to STILL TAKE TIME/EFFORT (or fuck even MORE effort), just not lock you into a second job that you have to clock into every day.    
---
That's not fun to me.  Even if it were a game I liked much more that wouldn't be fun.  Neither is seeing people who want to complete the three month long pass unable to do so because of real life responsibility.
---
The problem isn‚Äôt the flux , it the high ration fluid
---
i've never priced any round of ammo over one cap
---
that's the packtray difference \[tm\]
---
My preference is the Power Fist, but for something that lower level players can easily get that is fast and does a lot of damage early on regardless of your perks, I feel like its the Mole Miner Gauntlet. Death Claw Gauntlet is pretty stout, but they're a bit more difficult to find in the world. 
---
But a level 10 player can go get a MMG and collect all the mole rat teeth to upgrade(*more like to find someone with the perks to help them upgrade it*) it and have a formidible weapon at the end of their arm in no time.
---
Woefully generalized statement, that highly depends on the nerf in question, its impact how big a nerf it is, when aiming for a medium that promotes variety and redesigns then nerfs are not a negative force, especially for long term play as it will encourage its playerbase to seek out new builds and use previously untouched mechanics.
---
We're not talking about nullifying an archetype here, we're talking about normalizing bloodied downward and pushing the bottom ranks up so they matter without robbing bloodied of its primary strength both from a gameplay perspective and a thematic one.
---
Respawning got so much worse after they ‚Äúpatched out‚Äù god mode. 
---
At least once every two hours nowadays I end up getting trapped dead and have to jump servers or Re-log to fix. 
---
Stopped using lunchboxes because of this.
---
This 100% üëÜüèª
---
It‚Äôs still hard. Costs me a ton of ammo. I walked away thinking it wasn‚Äôt worth the cost.
---
Probably their way of trying to "balance" weapons. Since the assault rifle and hunting rifle just suck in comparison to the handmade/lever action, they give them a little bit more versatility in terms of mods
---
.308 receiver doesn't exist, that would be too useful
---
I could be mistaken but I think you cant only get it from a side quest in the mire now and its lev 1
---
Yeah only we‚Äôve been told that it‚Äôs on the high priority list of things they are working a fix for. An official reply.
---
Me and my buddy also have 4 daily, PS4 btw
---
I've fought three now recently and they didn't take that long to die, I thought they would be much harder also.
---
So are the account wipes just bullshit rumors or did those people have excessive amounts of duped items?  Makes me wonder where Bethesda drew the line?
---
I really want to see a little consistency with these too.
---
We got the Fasnacht Stein just for showing up.  The Meat Week one will probably be similar.  But the Captain Cosmos one is clear at the end of the board?  That's a *slight* escalation.
---
I could definitely see him being an ammo sponge. I wonder what his damage threshold is.
---
Respawn someplace else and go do something else in the game.
---
Why don't you just use the stealth armor
---
but vanilla Cyberpunk's monthly cost after release will be minimal - bug fixes and patches. The cost of development is covered by the upfront cost of the game and they make their money. I also love CD Projekt Red, but it's a completely different business model. Cyberpunk doesn't have servers to pay for and run! 
---
Ironically the only game that CD Projekt Red has with this business model \*has micro transactions\* - and that's Gwent. But unlike with 76, Gwent's upfront development costs were minimal, so it can be F2P. 
---
I completely understand that it feels like Bethesda is nickel-and-diming us, but there's a reason for that. I don't think any game developer, Bethesda included, goes into something with the mentality of "how can I make something that is such a blatant cash grab that it permanently affects my brand and my ability to sell AAA titles in the future?" (I guess EA is the exception to this, but honestly - fuck EA, even though they make the occasional gem).
---
I‚Äôll second this.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt realize they reversed any bans.
---
OP is referring to being unable to respawn to defend the factory, that is a bug not a mechanic.
---
Awwww that‚Äôs ok.  I‚Äôll just use it to quench my thirst!
---
that is really nice
---
Because that would require that the left hand understands what the right hand is doing, which I'm pretty sure doesn't happen at Bethesda Austin.
---
I don‚Äôt use any of the 3-4 nearby shovels. That‚Äôs what my 3-star Junkie‚Äôs FSS/90RW shovel is for. 
---
I ain‚Äôt dropping that one for you, pal.
---
i like the aesthetic, plus it is more expensive to repair.
---
If you're new to the game, you should check in your character's option to activate the pacifist mode (or whatever it's called). I'm not quiet sure if it affects workshops as well but, even if it doesn't, you should activate it anyway to avoid getting one shoted by random players ... intentionally or not. With it, you won't be able to damage any player or player owned structure and those who did not activate it will do reduced damages to you and get a bounty if they hit you. The game doesn't put you in pacifist mode automatically and you're eligible for pvp as soon as you hit lvl 5.
---
There not to difficult. They have actually made them easier but I feel you still. I don't like coming on to a game especially a fallout style game and being told what to do. It defeats the point of why I play. 
---
I have to deal with checklists and chores in real life. The last thing I want to do is come on to my game and have to work threw a checklist just to get some type of reward. I liked it better when they were atoms as I could safely ignore them and not lose out. It would just be a bonus if I got a few extra atoms threw natural play.
---
Now I just get random score points so if i get there I get there if I don't Its not a big deal. I will not change my play style just for there silly event.
---
I always put it in the cash register inside the building.
---
I love messing around in lower ranks in CS:GO with a shotgun, whenever I get a long range kill I almost always get a comment about wtf how did you kill me with a shotgun from all the way there. It's especially stupid here though that not only do the shotguns have almost no range, but their drop off is much higher than other weapons. I think 90% compared to 50% or something
---
i started bringing my own shovel tbh. i got sick of hoping there would be one there only to see it's gone.
---
That makes sense. I kinda neglect my CAMP as well but I have been trying to keep it updated with stuff as I find it.
---
Sounds like me in any MMO I've ever played with my friends.
---
I understand what you are asking for.  My big issue here is that there is no end game.  I think it's essential to have really powerful items that people want to chase, obviously nerfing the best strats to be on balance with the mediocre ones but would change what was "best", but it would also just make people feel weaker with no payoff.    
---
If you buff people and add in a payoff for that buff people would be much more excited.
---
Yep. Just because they talk slang and are kind of mean they arent raiders.
---
Eh, I don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs like saying when choosing between a $1, $3, and $5 lottery ticket, each with an increasingly higher grand prize, that because there is a chance you could only win a dollar from each ticket, that the $5 grand prize should also be available for the $1 and $3 level tickets, too.
---
Is that a question!
---
There's one in that underground instanced area under Dyer Chemical
---
He probably hit the ignore button by accident first after being killed.
---
You don't do my job for me,  you're ass.../s
---
Workshops are different. By claiming one you open yourself to pvp.
---
Yeah nah they're back polluting the game already. Ban wave barely lasted a week, now the cheaters know more than ever that they can do whatever they want and won't be punished. The only punishment is that they lost out on a week's worth of score, but most of them probably used the exploit to get to 100 already so it doesn't even matter
---
Corvega is probably the most "fallout" car, which is why people would buy it
---
That‚Äôs a good point. I wonder if they would ever plan on increasing drop rates.
---
The times I've played for the daily challenges, I seem to find a lot of nuke codes but no briefcases. Are they just real rare/hard to find or what? I picked up like 6-7 codes in one match.
---
No one dare challenge the grave digger.
---
Most people are making it sound like rumors some got got perm banned may got there accounts back but wiped but majority of the people got unbanned and kept everything
---
IMO mods are pretty easy to get going. I DL‚Äôd a mod manager off nexus that deals with the ini file stuff. No mod beats perk loadouts though, what a time save!
---
Good point üëç
---
Yeah you keep the ranger outfit.
---
What about ultracite ammo?
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was impossible but you can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs grindy beyond hell and RNG is stacked against us. 
---
Certain weapons don‚Äôt even drop in the regular enemy rewards pool so it‚Äôs not like you can just kill a 3 star queen and get a 5% at your dream 3* fixer. 
---
Again my point stands:
---
**if it was even slightly easier you‚Äôd see less of this shit.**
---
But downvote away and keep complaining when history repeats itself because BGS won‚Äôt listen to the many many great ideas to improve the legendary system.
---
I'm at 78. My target for this week was 80 so I'll reach that tonight with 2 days to spare, so I'll shoot for 83 before the weekly reset.
---
Next week's target is 88. I need to get back to grinding some treasury notes as I'll finally run out of those tonight.
---
Not all are back. Many got the perm ban and some are still on investigation.
---
Mainly First time offenders and people that didn‚Äôt over excessively use the exploit are unbanned
---
Wonder if it scales with number of players like queen seems to do...
---
Almost two years later and we still don't have a proper mechanism for *locking* items from being dropped, scrapped, or sold.
---
It's terribly easy to do what you did.  For me, I use VATS a lot, and because Tab is the same key that exits VATS and opens the Pip-Boy, if the game terminates VATS before I do, I'll often end up staring at my Pip-Boy whilst continuing to WASD and RELOAD with R... which is inexplicably the DROP button when you're in the Pip-Boy (what a stupid binding).  The amount of times when I need to stop and check myself, just to make sure I didn't drop something important, happens way too often for my liking because of this.
---
Gonna branch into that when I get more stuff
---
Better endgame would be good but given how limited the game is mechanically their only way to make a "challenging" endgame would be lots of health, damage resistance and a timer, and so in that sense they'd have to fix the power levels before making endgame that's aimed toward the endgame gear, even if they go with "buff everything" it would need to have some sort of consistency that isn't present atm.
---
Thanks. I guess next time I should just say no when launching a nuke when shutdown is imminent.
---
I mean, I see the appeal, but it feels like such little payout. Like, crouching already doesn't really affect my gunplay, as it makes sense to crouch and snipe from a distance for sneak attack damage, or stand and be more mobile with a shotgun or automatic.
---
Though I guess I'm also just used to not having prone in gun games. (lots of Battlefield/Battlefront, CSGO and Damage mods FO4)
---
Huh, so that video of the guy who was camped at Whitespring with like 10 of them in his camp is hating life and rolling in ammo, I guess?
---
I'm not saying people wouldn't buy it? I'm saying that it would have to be more than just a big ass stash box, but you would have to change it to do anything with it. Like I said, a planter, a grill, maybe they cut it in half and tear off the roof for a small guard post like the Free States trailers, but the Flea is small enough that it can just be a stash box.
---
You seem like you're just trying to argue for the sake of arguing, so this will be my last comment here.
---
Love it! I will need to make sure I take a road trip down to your emporium before my next Queen fight.
---
It shows 500 but am only getting 250. But of course no one ever reads the post before commenting.
---
Appreciate it
---
Does it also scale with the ammosmith perk? I was wondering how that worked, since 80% more ammo probably isn't enough to craft an entire second core.
---
If you're looking for an MMO experience to grind out a ton of hours? You will hit a wall after a still very respectable amount of hours played. 
---
If you're more of a casual/likes to do a little bit of everything/build camps etc type of player? 
---
You'll get a ton of enjoyment out of the game. Sure there's bugs, but it's not bad. It's a great setting, one of the best of any Fallout game. Great environmental story telling. The additions of NPCs has been a nice touch. 
---
As a camp builder? I still have yet to finish the main quest, and I've been playing since beta.
---
Its better than just saying fuck it.
---
you didnt say that until now.. thats why I asked...
---
Should just be able to scrap it like any other thing
---
I personally don‚Äôt mind weaker and bloodied players doing it.  But I am usually bloodied and I just run around.
---
That's not quite true. 
---
Plenty of BGS haters troll these waters.
---
66
---
To be fair - the whole point is that it's a rare and desirable item. If everybody's got it, what's the point of displaying it? 
---
So long as there aren't any ATX exclusive steins (but who am I kidding w that) I'll be happy. They should add some retroactive ones - kind of like how they did w the Mountain Scout outfit for people who bought Fo76 before Wastelanders. A Scorchbeast Queen Stein as a reward for having completed the story of vanilla 76 would be really cool and a reward for those of us that stuck with the game.
---
Oh, my sweet summer child.  Have you no memory of that time last year when *every* melee waepon was 50% limb damage and +1 AGI?  Which took them months to fix? üòã
---
Which is why I wrote "not quiet sure". The rest of what I said is still valable for him since I don't know a lot of people who raid low level workshops for profit, you know.
---
EDIT : "Additionally, player characters can initiate an Attack on Workshop event and attempt to usurp ownership of a workshop from the current owner. However, this can lead to some player characters triggering PvP combat to defend the workshop, or have some player characters end up becoming wanted if they kill another player character before they could fight back due to being in the workshop's build area at the time of the capture."
---
Straight from the wiki. Capturing a workshop doesn't remove the pacifist mode. You only get tagged for PvP if someone tries to take the workshop and start the event. Which is also why your turrets won't randomly target players until they innitiate an attack on the workshop.
---
BEAR HEAD, unarmed sneak is king!!
---
It should solve the problem. After moving you may have the ammo converter as a blueprint in the stored tab. Scrap the bluepring and you should be able to scrap the ammo factory, which is now in the stored tab.
---
I knew I saw this phenomenon before but couldn't remember the game
---
But what is the point of 20% extra vats if I keep missing my 95% shots?
---
Nope. Moving your camp will NOT solve this. The Ammo things from workshops will take up PERMANENT space in your camp budget regardless if it is scrapped or your camp is moved. Once placed it exists as part of your budget, permanently. And hey, if you want it fixed, file a ticket and risk a banning, start a new character or now live with it. Sorry.
---
First one is initiate which you can‚Äôt learn but that won‚Äôt effect you on the others.  Knight, knight sergeant, knight captain, officer, Paladin, elder
---
Fair enough. Have my upvote.
---
The queen doesn't scale.
---
Congrats - You don't need to give me anything don't worry üòÜ
---
I mentioned this in another comment down below.
---
You may have very well hit the ignore button accidentally after being killed. 
---
IIRC you cannot spawn or fast travel to a workshop after you hit that option.
---
The permabans are for accounts. So they‚Äôre not wiping players, your account is deactivated. Most the player base was allowed back with full inventory, but the major offenders will have to restart a new account from lvl 1 if they want to play again.
---
Try looking up a guide where they show all bobble heads on map and just start hopping around. It helps if you try looking in places on the map you haven't looted through recently. However, even using a guide me and a buddy still spent awhile finding one. Bobble head perk or not you still have to be pretty close to the spot. Having the mutation Marsupial is also clutch considering a lot of these damn things are on top of buildings.
---
.308 for the combat rifle would be awkward IMO. You‚Äôd need a whole lot of .308.
---
And, mind if I ask, what use do you get out of recon rifles anyway?
---
**Ok here‚Äôs the list of every thing I‚Äôve learned the hard way on how to beat / avoid it in the absence of BGS fixing it promptly:**
---
-	ALWAYS login to adventure first
---
-	ALWAYS login as the same character you used last 
---
-	NEVER be online during turn over - even at main menu
---
-	DO NOT open the atom shop before logging in *at all.*
---
-	NEVER play NW without logging into Adventure first 
---
-	ALWAYS login to Adventure before your done playing for the day / night
---
-	ALWAYS screencap and report to BGS if the above fails you
---
Absolutely lol. I don't know how it is for other people but ammo isn't even selling for me anymore. Kinda sucks but I never sold much of it anyway.
---
It's funny - a few days ago, I was fighting a Wendigo Colossus with a group, and after landing my hits, I decided to start taking pictures.  The sundew pollen created some really spectacular effects.  I was really surprised at how clear they turned out, with all of the motion that was happening.  And then I was like... well, *of course* they turned out nice, it's not a real camera, you idiot. ü§£
---
Ohhh my 3* Furious Shovel is used EXCLUSIVELY for Buried with Honor.
---
Why can you get banned for your ammo collecter?
---
To please that booty
---
I've gotten the initiate paint to drop still, it's in the loot pool still
---
This^
---
You can move your camp, but the ammo factory will be invisible in your stored tab. You can't scrap it or place it. It'll be in that menu either until they patch it out, or more likely forever. And it'll take up that budget until that point. 
---
Move your camp, delete the blueprint. It's the most you can do.
---
Initiate still drops
---
You can get the Plan for a Hazmat Suit from any Responder Bot. If not there are some at WestTek, inside in locker room near toxic goop, and Emmett Mountain Disposal, where the Event Radiation Rumble happens.

I‚Äôve been hit 4 times.
---
Each bullet point addresses one of the causal factors.
---
From the beginning I was disappointed tbh. Only took 3 of us melee build to sneak up and attack. Less then 30 sec, longer if we let em do their spook scream.
---
They didn't ban people for duping items that's why i say i don't think it's a bannable offence.
---
Basically anyone that it just deactivate hot unbanned and kept everything
---
I agree that sending in a ticket will give them another account to look at for a potential solution. The extra daily‚Äôs are the way they are helping people being hit with this bug. I‚Äôve been hit with it 5 times now and Bethesda doesn‚Äôt respond to tickets about this bug anymore.
---
People don‚Äôt have an hour a day to play a game they supposedly enjoy! How dare bethesda make me kill 15 scorched, eat a bubblegum and complete 2 events! /s
---
That could be the case, there was a paper bag at my point of death, but it only had my cheap scrap in it.
---
not everyone runs bloodied though
---
&gt;But of course no one ever reads the post before commenting.
---
There is no text base to your post, all anyone can "read" is the title, which has no information on what specifically is happening
---
Bruh is just trying to help you with the information he was given
---
Another suggestion I ran Across here on Reddit that I liked was to allow over encumbered fast travel but at high energy consumption, you can still walk but not run.  It would be a mod for power amour in place of a jet pack and have its own fusion core as it would cost 10 to 25 % depending on the distance.  The argument for this is to make queen fights and WC fights more worth it.  It costs a ton to go with little reward so being able to keep all the loot would help.
---
I'm partial to a Death Claw gauntlet. 
---
Extra claw mod. Good swing speed.....
---
I ran that for my first build. I had a LVL 45 Bloodied one star.... Not even the max level or best legendary and I was a terror. Just sprinting through mobs murdering everything in sight.
---
Once during the Scorchbeast Queen fight I saw her die in midair and bounce toward a fissure in the rad zone and disappear. Annoyed that I'd have to change armor to go after her, I dropped my junk into a stash box on another player's tent so I wouldn't die with any flux on me. But the second I stepped out of the tent the queen fell right out of the sky and landed at my feet. I looted her dead body without hesitation. It was beautiful.
---
I don't know if anyone knows for sure, but I've had the suspicion for a while that some prefixes are inherently rarer than others.
---
My guy who has the Armco Ammo Mill from the raiders is doing great, but my gal who doesn't she still has to go buy ammo sometimes. That's what she deserves for palling around with Foundation. I never sold much ammo, but I've been doing pretty okay lately with junk legendaries and the occasional literal junkies legendaries that I seem to get all of the time.
---
'Building team' has been my go to. Experience increase ontop of getting more back from scrapping.
---
I‚Äôll usually buy ammo for 1 cap to get the daily challenge out of the way, but I‚Äôll still buy additional ammo from the vendor after that (or stimpaks if the price is right)
---
Yeah, couple thousand rounds unless you are one of the meta builds or have a magic weapon. 
---
The upcoming event at least drops some flux but that has its own problem with the weird decision that it's an 8 people max event.
---
82 here, i can relate to this. Not going to grind anymore, just do the dailies for the next weeks and that would be all
---
69, gonna push 70 since I'm only 100 off
---
Nope but that‚Äôs also without the armour buff cuz of nuke zone as well mind you. That cuts down dmg a fair bit.
---
I would imagine a stealth junkie build with a proper handmade would do the job just as fast.
---
I‚Äôve never used medic weapons.  Are they good?
---
Everything else completed or just not showing at all?
---
One time when I went to find the raider thief legitimately they were fighting mutants in a cabin, while searching the remains for loot I saw a bunch of random items on the ground, thinking it was unique junk I took all of them for display later, the next day I went to do Ward‚Äôs daily and it autocompleted. It was weird but I looked at my inventory and one of the unique junks was gone.
---
I thought this would happen for the next 5 days as that was how many items I had but it still happens and the only item in my inventory is the power pack. But Ward annoys me so I am glad I only visit him for 10 seconds.
---
Yep, at this point I'm pretty sure I could wing it as the skin creator, I'd certainly make sure every weapon and armour type had at least 1 skin rather than just catering the Chad Handmade every single time!
---
&gt; To be fair - the whole point is that it's a rare and desirable item. 
---
Is it, though?  Or is the point more of a "I was there when this event happened"?  A memento of Summer 2020 in Fallout 76?
---
What were the other legendary effects?
---
Not showing at all
---
Behind the Bastards has a great two-parter about Blair Mountain I think you may like. 
---
https://podbay.fm/podcast/1373812661/e/1587463200
---
I wondered this to but for the Tent and Scrapbox ? is this the same ?
---
Take a screenshot. I'd like to see this.
---
2 friends made the same claim. I just think they can't math.
---
 I'm not walking 10 ft to another grave for a shovel. I demand players drop that spawns next to the grave
---
I logged in at 7pm last night with all dailies auto completed. 5k score gone. That's the last bug im putting  up with, cya fallout.
---
I use it all the time (literally) and I have a constant total of about 30 of each of the weapon buff bobbles and INT/leader (I sell all the rest)... and I always have a bobblehead active (also use Curator).
---
So it works, if anything a bit too well.
---
It's a lot better with a headset on though, otherwise it's difficult to use it to pinpoint a location and you will miss the sound when it's faint sometimes.
---
Oof. Maybe comment in here and tag a community person ? Lady whatever her name is?
---
Because it's a bug
---
49.5.
---
You cant
---
I don't understand. 
---
Why is it a bug?
---
Rank 80.
---
Slowing down, though.  Mostly because, by my math, I only need to get something like 1,400 SCORE a day to finish this in the remaining days, which the Dailies and Weeklies easily cover, even without the Double SCORE (or later events they haven't announced yet).
---
Not everyone is going to make it to the end though - and that's the point. It will be a rare item because only the most hardcore players (namely those that would discuss the game on Reddit) will have it. 
---
Also, keep in mind that people can play every day now because it's summer and because of COVID - what happens when the next season drops and you have to balance out all the necessary grinding in addition to work/school/kids etc?
---
Ok makes sense thanks
---
The raider ammo collector is safe to use.
---
The cheated one is not. It will permanently feed on your camp budget, and even if you move your camp, you can not get free up that space. Sadly, Bethesda does not care about cheaters in their game, not even hackers in NW,
---
You can make a blueprint from a workshop. Its complicated but it is
---
level up and find plans
---
I do too
---
I went supercrazy supersayan Xp force to hit 100 yesterday and am super burnt out. It was fun though. Exploiters probably hit 100 after a few days.
---
Been saying this for awhile. They should all have the same odds or drop legendary weapons according to the enemy's star rating.
---
I've had guys in my lobby that did 3 in a row and within an hour I had my first 3 scorchbeast queen kills. Their speed was insane.
---
Seriously? They dont care?
---
I agree they should do a better job developing end game content.
---
Yeah that's what I'm thinking about
---
Lol I do like Death gaunts
---
The raider reward? 
---
I've had it since shortly after Wastelanders. 
---
Never any issues with budget or scrapping it.....
---
It just sits and makes hundreds of 45 ammo.
---
Someone put one in my camp if and I can‚Äôt get rid of it, do I need to move my camp to prevent a ban?
---
Yeah not happy either
---
It's the ammo machine from the workshop, apparently you can somehow blueprint it and place it at your camo, but then you can't delete it so probably don't do this?
---
Wouldn't even spend the ones you get as a legendary run reward?
---
I dont know
---
So I find these plans in buildings ? Or something else ?
---
Realistically, you don't need to, as long as you do the Dailies/Weeklies.
---
This event has really shown me how we really need more high-level dungeons in this game.  Or a lot more placement randomization in the ones we do have.  West Tek, Charleston, and Burrows would be more interesting if the enemies were allowed to mill around.  But the fact is, once you get used to where they spawn, you're just going through the motions every single time.
---
And even if One Wasteland rejiggers the difficulty, the fact is, these locations are still the only ones with a sustained *quantity* of enemies.  Outside of Helvetia or Grafton Steel, you just don't find locations with lots of enemies in this game other than these.
---
The game sucks. Game devs deliberatetly fucking with game mechanics only to stretch playtime is disgusting. And you can see it everywhere in this game.
---
‚¨ÜÔ∏è **This**
---
It‚Äôs a super good two parter.

For those who don‚Äôt use google pods here you go - well worth it:

Will you get banned if it's in your inventory?
---
Well I've got nothing then. Moving would probably pop it into your stored items, but it looks like from what others are saying that it just kind of sticks around and you can't delete it
---
Meanwhile I loaded into a full lobby in which there were no active teams...
---
Yeah
---
&lt;Superman By Goldfinger Intensifies&gt;
---
These are great tho. 
---
I am inspired.
---
Only for the inventory or just in general
---
It is a very frustrating part of this game with bethesda.  Like i understand radio silence during the dupe thing but  things like this it would benefit them to keep open communication.
---
Well, if it's only one that you put out, it will curtail what you can build, but at least you didn't put out enough to fill your camp budget like I've seen. GL!
---
The 90 three star is a tank
---
Ohhh. I see. You heard about or found a glitch you thought you could take advantage of.....
---
Then found out you could get banned.....
---
Here's hoping your camp is fucked up forever.
---
You can Find em that way....
---
Or breaking down any weapons ya get that ya don‚Äôt want too keep/sell unlocks a great deal of crafting/modding possibilities.
---
Edit:What lvl are you,&amp; what gun are you lookin too use?
---
I may be able too craft ya one.
---
I‚Äôm not the end/all beat/all endgame player,but I got a lot of stuff unlocked &amp; wouldn‚Äôt mind helpin ya out if ya wanted.
---
Yes you can, im only lvl 38 started last week, but follow the questlines and you get some decent rewards lvling up and plans to make better weapons, thats what i found anyway
---
You should throw BGS that kind of feedback. 
---
We might actually get it with enough noise from non-F1st players
---
Can you still get Emmett Mountain Hazmat suit from this event??
---
Make some cranberry cobbler or relish. Also Berry Mentats
---
I wish bethesda would unlimit favorites, and then not allow us to drop or scrap favorites--not even a prompt of "are you sure?"  Just a "bzzzt, no."  
---
If you want to drop a favorited/destroyed item, you should have to go un-fav it first.
---
Do you left /closed the game right before they changed?
---
But it will still take up budget regardless if you scrap or move...
---
The reports are worthless. Although I will say, kind of surprised if the account keeps running around, because using the old erectus program to do that in NW should automatically flag him.
---
Its funny how they claim they fixed this BS and it is still such a large spread issue ...
---
Usually means they just left the server and the camp I‚Äôll disappear soon
---
For sure. I'm collecting all the cranberries right now. LOL
---
No, bloodied and furious are both major attributes
---
Edited: also antiarmor
---
at least its in keeping with the other high quality items bethesda offers
---
quests. capturing/defending workshops. vendors.
---
My fiance will only help build my c.a.m.p. She cares not about my legendary run... :(
---
I just want to know when RUST comes out.  Facepunch studios is going to make BGS look like fools.   Then again, my 6 year old niece can do the same.  Hell, I think a 1 legged dog can outperform BGS
---
Nope. A guy told me it was in the game. I suspected that it was really rare. He placed them and now I cant get rid of them
---
No he put 5
---
Just use his bank account info and pay to finish the legendary run with it on his account. Then tell him you grinded extra hard for him and make him take you on a nice dinner date.
---
It's like that since 3 hours.
---
Not very smart carrying a majority of your junk on you, just saying.
---
i believe this bug has been around since 2011 Skyrim, its called the Dragon Stalking bug, same thing happens in Skyrim but with dragons so i guess its old broken code left over.
---
Not just a bug, an exploit.
---
You have to go out of your way to perform the actions to cause it to happen, so it goes beyond being a bug. At that point, you are exploiting a bug in the game for personal gain.  
---
That's what makes it bannable.
---
I am with you.  What I don't understand is when the first time I log in and the CAMP can't be placed, I don't understand why when it says "world found" on the second try, even that isn't a guarantee.  If I say that I want to find a new world because my CAMP couldn't be placed, why o why does it pick another world where it still can't be placed? (I was just thinking about posting something about this).
---
Not all, there are still a bunch that got the permaban
---
Would you be willing to upload the original PNG and thumbnails for that? Because these are freaking fantastic. I'd love to add a couple to my loading pics.
---
one thing people of all levels do for this quest is.. shoot it down to a sliver with their main weapon and then bash it with the syringer
---
Lmaoooo ahaha that‚Äôs you‚Äôre fault you‚Äôre bad and should feel bad! Good bye food build
---
Yea. Exactly. I have two strength. The thing is though I can one shot any normal mob and most legendaries. Even the deathclaws die in one second. So it doesn't matter if you collect ore and the mobs get stronger. There is nothing that can get past me. So I just have resigned myself to a role of defending scavengers and hope others collect ore.

Maybe next time instead of assuming you're already doing it the best way try stepping back and considering you might be doing it the most difficult way possible. You shouldn't be server hopping to do any of these, unless you're on a server where enemy spawns are broken and you see a lot of static unmoving enemies (because that will mess with legendary spawns).
---
Legendaries are easy to find at some events but it's not the best source of them especially on public servers. You can much more easily find legendaries at almost ANY location where there's a lot of enemies and a crowned boss. There are dozens of locations like that. A lot of the mines, larger buildings, tunnels, sewers, fissure sites, and factories have a chance for at least one legendary spawn. This challenge is best done while doing other challenges though, and if you don't complete it by time the rest are done try hopping those locations and you can probably find one within about 15 minutes.
---
Events are so easy it's rediculous. You don't even need to be there for the whole event, just the end. So if you see any of the quicker events in progress just go there and help a bit and boom, done. If not you can spawn your own event by taking a workshop. It will start a defend event within a minute or two and that's a quick and easy event, kill a few enemies and done.
---
The bobblehead one was more luck based but if you use the perk for it and go to somewhere like Map76 and look up all the bobblehead spawns if you don't know any you can find one in a few minutes. I didn't even use map76 because I know a lot of the locations that have multiple bobblehead spawns (a lot of the "cabins" locations on the map have multiple spawn chances) so I just went to a few and actually found two bobbleheads at once. Also, I did this on a public server, not a private. It's just a matter of going to locations other people aren't likely to have searched, so avoid high traffic and mission locations.

You can request a refund from Bethesda. They approve many atom refunds.
---
sounds like youre hoarding way too much shit yo..
---
you shouldnt need more than 100 of anything on hand at any given time outside of a handful of very rare or constantly used materials...
---
xD I love taking pics in the Sundew Groves.
---
He did say that in the title but at first that's what I thought he meant too. Now he's complaining "when's the last time you got a good legendary item from a drop" followed by "all my items are duped". Well that's why cheating is boring because you get the most powerful stuff now everything else you ever encounter is trash. Sooo why would he care what enemies drop if he's bought all the best items from dupers? I've only seen certain enemies once or twice in close to 800 hrs but that doesnt mean I find a way to exploit the game and drop 100 of them from the sky at a time.

Ghost camp
---
I think that pop up should stay for when you‚Äôre invited or joining a friend, but even when you‚Äôre getting a world from the main menu it shouldn‚Äôt put you into one where your camp can‚Äôt be placed
---
you can find plans randomly all over the place. often times sitting on surfaces out in the open and not in containers, so they can be easily missed.
---
you can also buy them from player vendors and robot vendors at train stations or the golf course.
---
for weapon mods, scrap weapons of that type. ie. scrap a hunting rifle and you should unlock a new hunting rifle mod. most non legendary weapons are not worth selling so I grab em all and scrap them as often as possible, you can scrap anything at any workbench.
---
its not his fault the game itself froze and that doesn't make you bad at the game
---
You lose the tent. Scrapbox stays but only to take stuff out, you can‚Äôt put more in.
---
Edit: answer for u/DAbigCheeseyFoot
---
Some random "mutators" would really spice it up. Night or rain or even radstorms... That would be dope.
---
You'll want to probably check the sound settings in windows itself. There is the Application specific area, where you can direct audio to certain output devices, and the sound control panel where you can also set which is default for communications (I reckon this is the issue but hard to say without having a first hand mess around with the settings).
---
I‚Äôm not sure then whenever I see it, the owner just left the server.
---
Black Skins for every weapon
---
You can usually just play adventure mode and get more XP in a faster time.
---
So long and good luck
---
Powerfist. Same damage as deathclaw gauntlet, but with a little bit extra armor pen. Making it the stronger  weapon
---
Lol I just found this post after making a similar one
---
Classic!
---
Carrying too much slows down the game too
---
Bruh I didnt even know it was an exploit until after it was placed
---
You see the 2 as mutually exclusive. The Tod is simultaneously greedy and ignorant. That is the exact behavior BugthesDUH has displayed with every single update, patch, hotfix, lack of communication,  and failed interaction with PvP, PvE and Multiplayer. 
---
They couldn't fix anything if they wanted to and they do not care. The sad thing is that support would like to help, but they simply don't have the tools. That is after you get past the layers of bots and overworked lackeys.
---
Really , I‚Äôm in quite a large BoS guild/group and they all seem to think otherwise, have you acquired it recently?
---
This bug is as familiar and comfortable as a pair of nicely broken-in sneakers.
---
there are two yao guai's at dolly sods wilderness, there is a bench with a roof that you can use to kill it without it attacking you

They have had 5 stars since at least Fallout 3, and still never filled them.
---
Yeah i changed my C.A.M.P skin lastnight ( had to rebuild my C.A.M.P ) and logged in today to fast travel back and it wouldn't show on my map.
---
Drop rate might be a bit low but it drops still as along as you havent learned jt
---
It really would. They have the absolute power to control the narrative and talk to us. But for whatever reason they go silent and leave it to us to fill the gaps.
---
I hadn't been on since last night, and didn't get on till probably 10 mins after the change
---
A university but an m249. Wacky English language!

Yeah, I have the Knight PA paint and the under armour.
---
Ghost camp .. I have two characters and it sometimes happens to me, just a glitch more than anything else.

Thanks for the downvotes clowns

Put an alternate character in and bush camp, easy levels
---
West tek is pretty good
---
I may be a bit slow and don't have too many stimpacks but I always rush to help!
---
I'm fairly low level still so I haven't seen the more intense events but the funniest times I have to stimpack someone is always at the path of enlightenment, people jumping off the lighthouse xD
---
Power fist.Fisting the SBQ up the ass works so well
---
Interesting, I‚Äôll check it out I guess.
---
At low level though?
---
Free armor skins have worked before just fine. The Halloween skins worked fine, they just dropped the ball on the skins this time around, again. They've screwed up plenty of atom shop skins before too. It's not like paying for stuff has guaranteed it'll work. It's just been a bad situation all around with their QC on this game. Love the game, but I'm not going to pretend this hasn't been an ongoing issue.
---
Yes there are some that will, but that doesn't make my comment any more false, so yes is true
---
Yep! I still turn in the data
---
All I got from that is "flat". Water is flat: build on a pond.
---
Don't wanna get nuked? Build in excluded zones like near the vault or wayward.
---
Wanna build tall? Put your CAMP on a train bridge, or if you have a jet pack a tree (can be tricky).
---
Wanna have little conflict with random spawns? build west and away from spawn points. 
---
Wanna have NO trouble from random spawns? Build on top of Seneca Rocks. (need jetpack to get to south peak, NOT flat).
---
Wanna sell stuff? Build near White Springs Train Station, but be prepared for "unable to spawn CAMP" message, A LOT.
---
Want resources? Check the map refered to in Reddit to locate your preffered resource. There are two spots where you can mine TWO - One is a flat area on top of a cliff just a little east of the vault near a crashed biplane, the other NE of Granninger farm (ugly region though).
---
Gooduck
---
Go bloodied 2 handed, get a bloodied swing speed grognak axe or super sledge and destroy everything short of bosses in 1 hit.
---
For me, I found that taking ownership of workshops and then sticking around to defend them was a good way to level-up and get items.
---
Black skins matter
---
Yeah I mean if you are lucky and spawn in there, enemies will be a lower level. Or that was my experience
---
Hilarious .. keep a minimum amount in your stash box, stop carrying junk on you else be prepared to lose it at any given moment. Saying you won't play again because of a strategy you decided didn't work out is silly. No one carries that much junk on them. Keep Important junk in your stash.
---
How could you not know that was an exploit (besides ignorance does not grant innocence)?    You have to go and take the ammo factory workshop, then create a blueprint of the specific items (and in a very specific way), then go place it at your camp.  No where else in the game is there plans for that specific item.  I'm sorry but I don't buy the "I didn't know it was an exploit".
---
Now will Bethesda ban people for this&gt; I doubt it given their track record.  But it still is \*bannable\* in the sense by executing the exploit you violated the TOS.
---
I've got a shit ton of plans as well. On Xbox.
---
Hmmm okay, than one theoretical reason for it out of the way :'D
---
Professor Greebly travels into the future and is promptly captured by the Institute. 
---
Soon after a Professor Greebly returns back to his time. . .
---
You doing the athletics course? nice
---
I levelled one to 35ish by capturing and retaking workshops and inbetween doing the course. Probably helped that i had a private server to do it on. I had 14 or 15 workshops on the go for like 3-4 hours
---
Honestly. No idea. Pretty sure we stumbled upon the overseer early on or something? I‚Äôm not really sure.
---
That'd be a good point as I didn't think about variants of it. So maybe we got lucky and got a weak boy as far as they go.
---
There's a perk card that shows nearby briefcases on the radar. I use it because for bushwookie playstyle I need little perk cards (my core trio of cards is rad resist + better stimpacks + chance to find extra meds in boxes - this really helps me to advance to new locations under the cover of the firestorm when no cover is nearby). 
---
Using this card I actually managed to find the briefcase twice in the recent few weeks. Sadly, the best I could do was to find 2 codes before getting killed. I'm sure my killer didn't complain about the loot he got...
---
Grafton Dam + event us a good source of XP at low levels
---
Top of the world
---
Harpers ferry
---
Pretty low level enemies or weak scorch inhabit those areas
---
It has more armor pen? Really?
---
Been playing since launch, I know where to go for multiple spawns, took all of 5 mins to find a bobblehead
---
Admittedly when I first saw the challenge I thought "you're fecking kidding" personally dont think luck based challenges should be included as newer players wont have a clue where to go for one or probably havent discovered most of the locations yet, bit of a disadvantage.
---
As for the challenges being to difficult, generally takes 15 mins to 30 mins for all the dailies, probably 2 hours for all the weekly's, again it all stems from knowing exactly where to fast travel, doing multiple things at once..
---
I sell diluted stems for 3 caps and rad away for 3. I just don't use it at all
---
I agree, challenges should have given atoms like before and season xp should have been based on normal xp. Season system is bad like this, a net loss overall. I sort of went with it but there‚Äôs no cosmetics that I will use from the season anyway. This was a net loss on atoms.
---
I have one on PC
---
Join an event team and capture workshops. Then just do the first defense event. Rinse and repeat!!üëçüëç
---
Yes, I have one actually
---
Servers only have a specific life span before they need to be refreshed.  The server you were on was likely an older one that needed to be recycled.
---
When someone works 9-10 hours a day minimum, needs to keep up with family time and actual IRL responsibilities, an hour a day is precious time. I might get 2-3 hours over the weekend and an hour once during the week, but that's it. Do I enjoy the game? Absolutely. Do I have time to log in EVERY DAY for a long-term (ten weeks?) slog of uninteresting "challenges"? NOPE. If they made the entirety of SCORE weekly activities that could be done over a seven day period, I'd do more. It would've helped if they had some creative events for the season, too. But this game can barely get one bug patched without creating three more, so I have little hope for additional content being substantive.
---
Yes, with the piercing mod (which gives the best damage)
---
Took me nearly 60 attempts to get a bloodied gauss shotgun
---
I don‚Äôt have enough perception points to equip it though. 9 points is a lot when you‚Äôre a heavy weapons build. I can‚Äôt even get frog legs. I‚Äôm struggling dude üòµ
---
How much more fun would this game be if it actually felt like a dangerous place with some edge to it instead of a fortnite inspired cutesy costume party where no one could hurt each other? 
---
How about in game gambling? Gladiator type events with spectators? They are catering to the wrong crowd. It doesn't feel like fallout. It is lifeless because there is no danger and people lose interest.
---
Seems the Future-Tec C.A.M.P might be bugged changed the skin to Raider and the icon started showing again.
---
If you have the game you have Wild Appalachia, you can't play the game without it.  All the DLC has been free.
---
PS4?
---
Yes I preordered it for full price and didn‚Äôt even open it until 4 months ago.
---
Even better!!
---
i just got the chicken coup....happy as a pig in s@#t........so i too am now done,feel like i won the internet "chuck chuck" my little featherless  friends. :)
---
I like the Charleston Capital Building. Has a ton of ghouls in it and I'm pretty sure they scale with your level.
---
150 caps 4 bubble gum profits
---
The discord group I'm in has been doing runs since early morning you may of been on the server with us
---
I would only vote for that if we could get a scrip raise, currently have more legendaries than I know what to do with.
---
The seedy sheds come with lights on them. 
---
I also use the oil lamp posts as they generate a good chunk of light but need no electricity. 
---
I try to hang lights in the center of buildings for inside lighting to maximize the spread. 
---
Also the flood lights? The yellow ones? Those things. Last out a ton, but I find them too bright.
---
Are you camped in the mire?
---
oh, didn't know that, thanks anyways
---
Nice idea! But how do i do it?
---
Fallout 76's Raiders are Raiders Light.
---
I rarely get a 3 star drop from a 3 star enemy. I thought they said they we're fixing that.
---
Now I'm picturing a suppressed meat hook with a cork plug on the pointy end.
---
They're trying to say they feel like their hand was forced in order to get anything. They experienced frustration at constant grinding getting nowhere, and decided the only way to get the items he's grinding for was to get them duped. His overall point is that it felt unfair that a 3 star creature so frequently drops 1 and 2 star items, and not enough times with a 3 star item. 
---
While it is nice that you and I haven't succumbed to the weight of such frustration, considering the point being made that he feels the only way to actually get halfway decent 3 star items at all is through the only people with a supply of them to buy, the dupers, I find the frustration OP is experiencing to still be a valid point, even though he chose to 'fix' this issue for himself in a way that involves cheating.
---
While I don't condone his actions to fix this issue for himself, I still agree with his overall point that it seems unfair to fight a bunch of 3 star legendaries to grind, but only getting 1 and 2 star items because RNJesus is fickle like that. It does make more sense for a 3 star creature to drop only 3 star items, and so forth for 2 star and 1 star creatures. 
---
You do too, you've stated as such, but were thrown by OP buying from dupers. Keep the two things separated. You can agree with the initial point, but still not condone getting involved with cheaters just to 'fix' this issue for himself.
---
I was in it for the raider tree but just recently found out about the coop, which I somehow missed when I originally looked at the board.
---
It's the other thing I need to have now.
---
I might actually be able to get a kill XD
---
How are they always out of ammo with that build?? I got into that build because I was tired of the ammo grind with all the other builds I tried. This is the first build I've ever had such a surplus of ammo I can actually use whatever gun I want and not have to rotate through them based on what caliber ammo I have built up from not using. I don't just use a fixer though, that would be boring. I have a dozen or so different weapons to suit the build and grab whatever I feel like using. Right now I've been actually having fun using a bloodied 33% vats M79 40mm launcher, which was total crap with every other build I tried to use it with... but somehow works great with this one. Also been using a Suppressors Flamer and a quad tesla a lot at events to help the lower levels who show up to grind XP.
---
Some times I join and it says your camp can't be placed I just say fuck it and load in and there is no even near where my camp is.
---
no it doesn't they removed it from the game because initiates wouldn't wear power armor therefore they wouldn't  have a power armor paint
---
Yeah, I'm in the mire
---
the sun
---
why share his videos to get him more views?
---
Ok, understood. I am asking because my ex girlfriend was also playing f76 and she had around \~ 70 plans in her camp.
---
Friend of mine in an enclave group got it twice
---
I understood, so it's just a bug.
---
Would these be the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù of Horse Armor?
---
I'm tired of running around with my shiny Flamer.
---
Got one on PS4...
---
I use the greenhouse domes. They need only one light bulb hanging from the center to be well lit.
---
Nothing against you and you may be more knowledgeable in things like this than I am, but that is the stupidest f‚Äôing thing I have ever hear. I‚Äôve been playing for two hours and a server is too old and needs to be recycled? And it literally says ‚ÄúGame Services are shutting down for maintenance soon‚Äù so it sounds like everything is being shut down. I‚Äôm just honestly tired of all the Bethesda BS.
---
It's the skyrim dead dragon bug all over again. 
---
Todd please...
---
I started selling Bobby pins at 1 cap each. They have no weight, so I don't waste stash space. People can sell them to a robot vendor and cap their cap back if needed. And nobody is really going to buy more than what they need to complete the challenge.
---
I have 2....
---
I just want to get it done with so I can go back to CAMP building and just messing around and not have to worry about doing ANY challenges at all.
---
True, good job and congratulations!

No thx... stupid idea...

---
I hope this will be alleviated with the instanced interiors they have on the roadmap. Since the shelters are instanced, they should put considerably less strain on the server, meaning they should have a larger budget.
---
Carrying all yours Junk with you is extremely BAD! I‚Äôm glad this happen learn your lesson and stash your junk! Bad at the game because you don‚Äôt know how to manage stash space - huge part of Fo76 unless you pay to win.
---
What really pisses me off is when you decide to just load in anyway and there's no camp anywhere in sight.
---
As a person that loves to display my bear collection, Mr Fuzzy collections and other collectables...it is frustrating that these items take up so much which restricts how much of my collection I can actually display
---
I dont like duping, but how are you going to ban people from using an exploit that Bethesda created and didnt fix, isnt that why there was an alpha, beta, and constant game testing? Oh wait its Bethesda lol.
---
Too much room for error, you might stash it and then suddenly the skin reverts or you lose mods on it, etc, I dont trust the current state of bethesda to make something like that
---
I carry 2 power armor with me my t65 and my Excavator armor both have the carry armor. Those mods are godsend man especially on the excavator set that goes up to 475
---
BE pipe rifle is way underrated. I had a BE pipe revolver and BE pipe bolt rifle , both set up with stocks to double dip perks and that was what got me into the whole bloodied vats build thing. Great weapons, 4K damage per hit, the only thing I've had so far short of a BE harpoon gun that would one shot scorchbeasts.
---
I doubt they will ever implement 4 and 5 star. They cant even get skins right without problems.

You've been playing for 2 hours. The server has been hosting for much longer than that. It might not be fun but it has nothing to do with how long you've personally been playing. Also, I just checked the Status Portal &amp; it says all games &amp; services are operational, so it doesn't look like it's a service-wide shutdown.
---
Don't tempt me. ;) jk
---
You've been on for two hours, but the server has been up for 18, or whatever the timer is.
---
The servers need to cycle.  Not the least of which is just because they do as a computer.  All those broken enemies that are unkillable and have their ai disabled.  Often missing limbs too?  The best way to get rid of those is a reset.  Theres plenty of little details that can be solved with occasional restarts.
---
Also, it was likely just the server that the instance was running on.  I think they only have the one notification for anything that involves shutting down the server. 
---
Sucks to lose the effort, but it happens, and is one of the prime reasons that most people find workshops to be unnecessary.  I myself only take the fusion core generators, acid farm, and used to take the ammo factory.
---
Tag first (melee usually), then emote is what I do.  :-)
---
So by that logic, why would a harder enemy drop crappy loot then. If 3 star enemies are harder the rewards should match the enemy. I killed 7 3 stars yesterday and only 1 reward was a 2 star the rest were 1 star. Shitty 1 stars at that too, I dont mind that 3 star enemies drop 1 and 2 star items, but the drop rate on 3 star loot from 3 star enemies sucks!
---
Thank you, that'll do nicely!
---
They should just make combat skin works for fixer.
---
What system do play on? I might just have what you need if you're on ps4
---
I mean this comment makes it clear you don't understand how it works at all.
---
Lol! I've seen that a few times as well!
---
My most recent CAMP is in the mire. 
---
[Mire Shanty Town](https://youtu.be/N-GMZrnnd9I)
---
Lighting is a challenge in the mire. Lighting a whole camp is too difficult on the budget. 
---
So I tend to only light places where I have stuff, and created just enough light spread to see in empty spots.
---
Girl I was doing my bfs rep for the settlers and the raiders while I was doing my own. I got overwhelmed and stopped doing his. It was too much üôÑ
---
See?! That's what's happening!
---
A lot of people are still in limbo, "temporarily suspended".
---
No, OP is discussing xp for overseer rank as it‚Äôs one of the daily challenges to increase it.
---
This one is a clean responder. Nice girl, no addictions, scrips Junkie's items to prevent addictions.
---
I think Bethesda shut the server down intentionally just to spite him for being such a dingus.
---
I just discovered this issue myself.  Naturally this was after hours of making my new C.A.M.P.    I just wish you could blueprint much more combined items.
---
This should honestly not at all be in a challenge.
---
oh wow,its brill,the chucks "chuck chuck" sooooooo cool.
---
I swear I find them all the time, except when it becomes a daily challenge, then I had to use the perk card, and search over a dozen locations, and still nothing. It was a friend that had already completed the challenge that found one for me. A couple of hours later I finally found one on my own. Let another friend grab it.
---
Bug.
---
It does make you wonder about testing.
---
It'd be nice if we could place limits on how much of something a player could take out of the vendor. I have a sign up for my "free" vendor, but you get the random player who thinks they need 3,000 rounds of 10mm ammo for whatever reason.
---
Yes, I have just deducted it. Tested it with some other items.
---
You‚Äôre right, I didn‚Äôt know that was how it worked. But it doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a pain in the ass. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

n1NICKELBACKFAN (it‚Äôs a joke they‚Äôre terrible) on XB. All my plans and ammo are 1 cap. Sometimes I throw in one star legies just to be nice
---
I'm okay with it being part of the build budget, but not the stash budget.
---
It‚Äôs better to actually play the game. Don‚Äôt be a scrub in a shrub.
---
I‚Äôm fine with that too. Nuclear Winter can be fun but if it‚Äôs grinding challenges it becomes mundane with the slow cooker grind
---
That would explain why healing factor and bloodied seem related to this fast travel bug, maybe the code for HF is trying to heal but the character has very high rads so it gets stuck in a loop, thus fast travel stalls.
---
I'm bloodied, removed healing factor and can now fast travel reliably for the first time in months.
---
I am actually. But, I just had someone reach out and offer me something. If that doesn‚Äôt fall through I‚Äôll get back to you
---
This. The reason people think this game is a dumpster  fire is most of us spend our free time enjoying the game rather than taking to reddit to complain about it. And the player base has been growing, not shrinking. Idk why people think it‚Äôs dying out when their numbers just spiked with game pass. 
---
As you said, Bethesda may be adding a lot of insignificant content for more than its worth. But so what if you don‚Äôt like it? Someone probably still does. 
---
I bought the game for $50 and haven‚Äôt spent a dime since despite hitting 300hrs. Seeing as a 2 hour movie at the theatre is $10-15, Bethesda‚Äôs practically paying me to play at this point
---
Omg, the grind for Settler and Raider rep is a whole other ballgame. I only just got to cooperative on both sides for my main toon. I can't imagine grinding it for my boyfriend too. üíÄ
---
lol yup
---
As long as your girfriend doesn‚Äôt say that you have a minigun eh ? Boom boom !
---
Lol Imagine bragging about duping fucking stimpacks
---
The only daily I have an issue with is leveling, because sometimes all I get is 30 mins to play. All the weeklies and dailies are generally easy and like the others have said can be done with normal play.
---
Yeah you do make a very valid point. Studios have to make money somehow and I acknowledge that. It‚Äôs just... it‚Äôs become very blatant with Bethesda now. They‚Äôve lost all creativity when Obsidian left. Fo4 was a change of scenery and was nice but it just doesn‚Äôt feel the same anymore. 
---
Bethesda has a lot of HUGE franchise titles and Fallout is one of them. It has/had a MASSIVE player base, and to see them lacking content within two years of Fo76 just says a lot to me to be honest with you man. 
---
EA does make the occasional gem but they have micro transactions brimming outta their ass. Fallout never really had micro transactions to begin with, just DLCs and hard driven stories and adventures. Once they brought in Creation Club, all their creativity for the actual game got flipped to actual assets and items that can be sold for real money. I feel like that‚Äôs what went wrong. 
---
They lost all creativity for prime genuine pipeline content that wouldn‚Äôt stop pumping, but instead started thinking more about what they can sell and take advantage of... useless skins and costumes that have no benefit except for bragging rights or fallout swagger. (I‚Äôm guilty of this, but it makes me sad that I am.) 
---
Even myself has fallen victim to this monopolization of micro transactions across all games... but Fallout shouldn‚Äôt have ever done that. Instead of putting all their creativity towards skins, camp items, weapon skins and shit that have no benefit, divert it into ‚ÄúHmm, what can we do within our coding to improve this game and bring in more content?‚Äù
---
Oh, how about we continue the story of finding out where the actual source of the scorched is and how to stop it for good? Eradicate scorched for good and rebuild Appalachia the right way. As far as I can tell, I‚Äôm pretty sure we killed the scorchbeast queen at least a billion times. What happened to all the genuine stories and npc interaction and dialogue? 
---
Wastelanders was a joke as in terms of bringing people into Appalachia. Literally not a single side quest from a random wanderer out in the wild besides Allies that say the same 4 things and give the same two quests. They‚Äôre all at least raiders or settlers. 
---
There‚Äôs just not enough life in this game and it‚Äôs already been out for two years. They‚Äôre extremely slow on updating and bringing content. It takes them a few days to come up with a season pass but 8-10 months for maybe 10 hours of content from Wastelanders? 
---
This is just how I feel about it. I have an extreme love for this game alll the way back to the original Fallouts. But over time, it‚Äôs slowly deteriorated into this mobile game cash grab. If they continue this practice for the next Fallout, it‚Äôs safe to say I won‚Äôt pick up Fallout ever again, unless they sold it to another studio who would actually go back to the original bearings of Fallout. Story telling, adventures, and companionships.
---
Fighting and dying early on (I prefer this because you actually play the game) gets me less xp than hiding in a bush for top 10. I honestly don‚Äôt want to hide in a bush but dying early means playing more games that I could have spent playing with my friends in survival. Now if Bethesda increase do gains with each kill that would definitely get me to stop bush camping
---
I sold mine for 50k
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
Yeah, but it only drops once.   Once is great.   When things get wild, I've often overlooked looting a SB corpse, and this way, I get the loot later.   I probably wouldn't be as happy if it continued multiple times throughout a play session.
---
Rip no wonder. I didn‚Äôt know you had to finish the quest
---
You could always go trade...why not try a hand in it?
---
Dang, I meant mods LOL and forgot to mention it,  rip :D
---
This happened to me yesterday. Some fucker kept doing this. At least 3 or 4 times
---
Encryptid is a public event that anyone can trigger, and the plans for it are not a guaranteed reward.
---
It means that you can get it without doing any quest at all, or simply buy one.
---
Fallout 4 was like this, correct?
---
yeah I like the oil lamp posts too
---
I wish, tablet only I‚Äôm afraid.
---
Not if it's a Gauss Shotgun.
---
Aw shit, here we go again...
---
getting the plan is Not Easy.  keep an eye out for people selling them. if you want a non-legendary, I can make you one.
---
Or find the plan in a player vendor.  I got one for 10k caps.
---
It doesn‚Äôt always drop crappy loot. It exclusively has a chance to drop better loot. It‚Äôs still RNG, but tilted toward better gear. There could be an argument to increase drop rates, maybe. I personally feel like legendaries are way to common in this game.
---
I think you figured it out man, honestly. Bloodied characters it seems have more trouble than others
---
The yellow construction double spotlight (Forgot its name) that you have to actually wire up has pretty good range and is bright.
---
Oh no im just looking for the actual weapon from sheep‚Äôs clothing apparently you can get it there
---
does the dark matter skin not work on it?
---
Bush wookies for life
---
If the weapon is in the legendary pool, it can exist with any effect. 
---
You haven't seen one because it's just rng.
---
COVID isn't an airborne pathogen. Derp.
---
Any skin for the fixer would be nice.
---
If you want to switch to melee then you will want to run the heavy. In any case, pistols are sub optimal in general. 
---
You can easily farm cores and make them last longer via perk in int
---
Also, dont open the map for a couple minutes after loading into a world.
---
Gamer girlfriend problems, I'm literally doing the same for mine! I hope you find someone to help :)
---
I just love the fact we both realised what each other were doing and in that moment a truce was formed  and we didn‚Äôt even consider a fist fight
---
Nope you're not allowed.
---
Yeah can second this my friends did it loads got everything still after unban.
---
I had a good laugh... don't be so serious.
---
My guess is the amount of polygons and that each is an instanced item. You know how when you load in the game and there‚Äôs like 50 random sound effects kick in? Your character is loading all its stats and information after logging in every time. My guess is if they push the camp size any bigger a lot of ppl won‚Äôt be able to start it at all. As long as the game has to load in your account every time you log in there‚Äôs only so much data it can process before the entire game would just crash. 
---
Zenimax needs to just stop being cheap and let them make a new game engine that solves those problems. This current one is just a Frankenstein of over a decade of broken gameplay
---
Oh, but the temptation to push the button when you've made it all the way to launch prep already. Nobody blames you, sir. It was an impossible position to be in.
---
O god this is key. So many errors if you don‚Äôt wait.
---
Don‚Äôt think so. The last time I checked for paint mods, only saw the Blood Eagle option (on Wednesday, I think).
---
You should be fine most people arent even tier 40 yet
---
People bitch over the stupidest things.. back in my day you couldn't play for more than 30 min without DC.
---
Side bar if anyone wants to come and build a few of those fancy Thanksgiving display shelves at my camp I‚Äôd be so thankful and compensate. üëçüèª
---
But that‚Äôs the case your making to justify people‚Äôs reasons for buying duped weapons. It‚Äôs just to grindy or hard.
---
It‚Äôs not. The truth is people are too impatient and frankly, entitled and believe there deserve it without effort.
---
If it was slightly easier people would still complain it wasn‚Äôt easy enough.
---
I love how people have bring up bro g downvoted as if it‚Äôs going to protect their post. Like if you downvoted what I have to say your the problem! You‚Äôre ignoring the truth! Talk about ego,
---
**nobody is forcing you**
---
What is this about skins? Dropped weapons with skins are bugged and disappear?
---
I like nw so null
---
Yes bloodied unyielding is OP.  But players should never tell others how to play the game.
---
Some perks actually change the experience of fallout.  That's what I love about it.  The flexibility and choice.  If someone wants to run in PA then let them do it.
---
That's what I thought.  Cheers!
---
If someone else placed em, then I'd file a ticket stating as much.
---
A nuke
---
My god, I‚Äôve seen better skins made by amateurs for counter-strike 15 years ago.
---
They're ATX I don't think that's possible
---
Yeah, not a fun thing.
---
A guy built it for me
---
Am I wrong but I'm sure back in the day the weapon stars would match the enemies stars.
---
I put almost all of your photos in my loading screen folder!
---
I'm using it for good
---
I agree. The fact that we can't just place items on tables, shelves, and elsewhere like Fallout 4 is Dumb!
---
Had that with uranium fever the other day. People were using follow me when the legendaries came out but this one person kept destroying them before we could tag and get credit. I was still able to get legendary drops though.
---
As an Enclave Character, it made sense. It also looks pretty cool as well.
---
They JUST use the fixer, and won't adapt to any situation were the fixer is not the answer. Start doing a couple SBQ fights and in-between getting insta-gibbed by anything that does poison damage (if your gonna play bloodied you have to accept it makes you easier to kill) they are just spamming .45 into the air like it's free. combine with not doing anything accept farming XP and ammo gets expended fast.
---
Yeah my RNG sucks lol
---
Assets aren't placed or checked until you connect.
---
no.  
---
legendary modules are a crafting component of armors and weapons you buy plans for with gold bullions after finishing the wastelanders quest line.
---
it's easy go to site prime usually you get a legendary scorch beast or two, yesterday I had 3 legendary scorch beast spawn, and a frigging lvl 95 3 star albino death claw spawn 5 feet behind me too......no stress just " Oh, shit just got real fun"
---
Are you talking about legendary modules? Those are only used to craft weapons and armor that are bought through the gold bullion system, they cant be used to make regular items legendary
---
You cant change or create legendary items. Exception are the previously mentioned gold bullion items. But those are only craftable, and unalterable
---
Thank you, hoping it was a plan.  Maybe November lolüò©
---
I think to be on track you have to be 55 by the end of this week
---
No worries, i love the support this community gives, so i try to do my part as well.  Anywho, my psn gt is the same as on here, feel free to .mssg me, as I'll be on this evening
---
By the end of this week do you mean when the weekly reset
---
I believe it is a feature not a bug. Just like the floater grenades. You can't trade them so when you drop them they are destroyed.
---
Happens to me regularly, yesterday I killed 4 SB's and then fast travelled to "census violence event", when I spawn in it dumped all SB's on top of the robot in one of the groves and nobody could see shit , the 3 dudes already there were quite surprised :P
---
It makes you wonder how those skins are programmed.  Shouldn‚Äôt it just be like a texture replacer?  I mean hell they‚Äôve had skins and retextures for ages now.  I get some clipping but not all the other issues.
---
K.  That was my PSN. I‚Äôm set for offline, if that makes a difference.  
---
In game is aj-98.
---
IRL stuff here too.  I‚Äôl catch up with you later tonight.
---
They confirmed that in a future update, combat rifle skins will work on the Fixer, including the Dark Matter skin.
---
Why do you think I made this post?
---
The big tower building in the center of Watoga. Maybe Sugar Grove, too. Your best bet per minute spent is just the Whitespring bunker and repeat the next day. Server hop so the desks without technical data have another chance to spawn one, so long as you don‚Äôt loot them.
---
I personally ADORE the marine armor now that the helmet has been officially released. Scout armor is nice too but the helmet is ugly ngl
---
Maybe the real 3\* legendary was the friends you made along the way
---
What? You can use mods in Fallout 76?
---
So I wasn't responding to the folks who did the whole " It's free why complain" bit because "Hey is their opinion, completely wrong and lacking in any merit, but everyone is should get to speak their opinion" but I'll respond to you.
---
1. Just because its "FrEe CoNtEnT" doesn't mean they don't have to put any effort into it. They have the resources and man power to put out quality content, they just don't. 
---
2. They didn't do this out of the kindness of their hearts. They are a AAA game studio, and they wanted another revenue stream. 
---
3. If it was completely free maybe I could see where your coming from, but the fact is it isn't free. A $1.50 let's you skip the grind level by level, and there gonna  gonna be people who do spend to skip the grind. Now whether thats 1 level, 10 levels, or 100 levels, it doesn't matter. You can pay to get around it, and since you CAN pay it's not really free. Since there is a fee associated with the Legendary Run, it is completely open to be judged from a consumer viewpoint.
---
And by the way, it called feedback you child. Everyone spent the money to play 76, whether they are DAY 1 players or Wastelanders or Game Passers. Everyone gets to have an opinion, and since this is a public forum, they gets to voice their opinion. If you can't handle that, then I suggest you just block me and move  on.
---
keep an eye out for the plans though! apparently learning the plan is required for you to ever get a legendary fixer from the Purveyor.
---
Indeed. I got a 1* vampire‚Äôs black powder pistol. So disappointing. It‚Äôs not even worth it.
---
Gives me doom vibes
---
Its not tick blood sac. Its just blood sac. Its different. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_sac_(Fallout_76) Blood sac is a rare random item for crafting Skeeto Spit https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Skeeto_Spit_(Fallout_76)
---
I've been trying and the only guy I found selling on was a god roll B2525 fixer am he didn't want anything I had
---
There‚Äôs no way to reset it. It absolutely requires teamwork.
---
Yeah tbh, they should have taken the time to remove duped weapons and unbanned also. Or cleared inventory. Or I think really they should just nerf exploding energy weapons or remove the exploding effect.
---
The super, super neat thing that that you don‚Äôt *have* to play NW. Nobody is holding a gun to you and saying they‚Äôre gonna pull the trigger if you don‚Äôt do it. So just...don‚Äôt.
---
Bethie forces you if you want to reach the SCORE  100 level as soon as posible. Also we are now at double score points so yeah, you are kinda forced. Don't fuck me with that shit.
---
you're not wrong...
---
I had to stop selling ammo as it was too easy to max caps quickly. I've started dumping all my ammo on to an alt.
---
I think when they saied 'changing enviroment' they refered to the whole area  getting iradiated, plants mutating for flux and mobs turning into scorched variants.  It doesnt neccesarely mean that the geometry of the area changes.
---
What type of ammo are u selling if I may ask?
---
Everything you claim stays yours
---
Otherwise you are forced again, you know how? Paying real money for atoms, 150 atoms each level if you lose the chance of gettint maximum points each day. Also, EVERY. SINGLE. DAY you must play that shity game mode for more score.
---
My take is that 3* drops are guaranteed on 3* enemies. Same with 2* and 1*. A simple balance change would be to just make them spawn less often. You‚Äôll run into less 2 and 3* enemies but when you do you‚Äôll at least be guaranteed an item with that amount of stars
---
Glitch that allows you to blueprint the ammo factory object itself.
---
Most excellent!
---
I saw a guy on PC yesterday with his camp in the big dry lake bed. He had like 10 of these ammo factories and like 80k ammo for sale. Seemed fishy but he logged off before I could get a better look around. 
---
So these ammo factories aren't legit items?
---
That will be my single most inspired thought all weekend.
---
The most baffling part is 80ish percent of the player base would be super forgiving no matter the issue.  I keep telling myself that they give a shit but alot of days i dont have a bunch of evidence to prove it.
---
If it‚Äôs priced at 1 cap I bet they really don‚Äôt mind.
---
I know but in the gameplay, they showed charleston, in my mind i really thought this was the destruction caused by the nuke.
---
But duping is a serious offense.
---
Been able to do the 3 legendaries in under ten minutes between west tech and the golf course or just by doing encrypted
---
Shame on you for thinking that is entertainment.
---
Ahhhh amazing! Is that a regular thing in your group? I‚Äôve been looking to try and get involved with something like that
---
With the Ultra Light Mods, you can reduce their weight to almost zero, while still having high DR/ER.
---
Very good for Stealth Builds.
---
you don't need to reach 100. nobody is forcing you. If you want to pay to get to 100 that's on you.
---
Shush! We can't have everyone know!
---
I don't mind the luck of the draw aspect for drawing a 1\* or 2\* on a 3\* enemy, but the queen should definitely drop 3\* items only after grinding to drop the ole' gal.  I find the Rusty Pick rolls a lot more disappointing.  I seem to get an endless supply of bug killer 3\* pipe guns.  I'm hoping perseverance will prevail.
---
Maybe you would have had an argument a few weeks ago, but now that there‚Äôs 9 dailies each day, you‚Äôve kinda lost on that argument. Unless you‚Äôre gonna try to say that before the 9 dailies, it would have been impossible to complete this. Which isn‚Äôt the case. Just don‚Äôt play NW. Easy.
---
- No one is forcing you or expecting you to get Lv. 100 in the legendary run
---
- No one is forcing you or expecting you to get all the SCORE in a single day
---
- There is no benefit to completing the legendary run outside the prizes you get along the way.
---
If you feel compelled to play until you get all the SCORE in a day, I'd suggest you step back from gaming for a few weeks.
---
Good all-around type, quite light compared to Combat, and you don't have to worry about mods: just buy them from modus. 
---
I like Combat better, though. Full leather looks fantastic and Marine can be cool if leaded. 
---
Robot is the one I have never tried.
---
If you‚Äôre ps4, feel free to join my lobby and team. I always have an event team running even if I‚Äôm not grinding one event after the other
---
Yep, same. We don't even get a crater lol.
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt force you. You choose to reach it ‚Äúas soon as possible‚Äù. Plus the problems you speak of I never have had ever.
---
150%
---
The way it works is that you *might* get an item with the same amount of stars as the enemy you killed. If you kill a 3*, there‚Äôs a chance you will get a 3* item. If you kill a 2*, there‚Äôs a chance you‚Äôll get a 2* item. However that chance is so low that it hardly happens
---
Too bad buying an item for 0 caps doesn't count as a sale, even though "purchased" shows up in the corner.
---
Yeah they're a glitch I'm gonna use them for good now.
---
Yes we love fighting queens we have dedicated silo runners that launch daily and alot of times throughout the day
---
While your right about some players - your slighting the old guard with thousands of hours sunk in. 
---
there are people who have sunk in 5k+ hrs and got squat as to what they were after. 
---
-	Did you ever get a drill from Vault 94 or the Queen?
---
-	Have you sunk 10k scrip into the Purveyor and got nothing to show for it?
---
-	Have you bought 20+ recall cards, main‚Äôd the event and never gotten a fixer plan?
---
Can‚Äôt help but feel you‚Äôd look at this a little differently if you‚Äôd been burned like that. 
---
This isn‚Äôt like Destiny where it‚Äôs a matter of doing the quests to get x y z - **you are at the mercy of the server seed** - if it‚Äôs a bad roll for you  - you can seriously waste your time. 
---
I‚Äôm not condoning buying weapons. I‚Äôm just saying this game has some problems around rewards and loot and it incentives that behaviour. 
---
If you want it fixed - address the root cause instead of chasing symptoms.
---
Any yogi will do for that quest. Just wander around Toxic Valley and you'll find plenty of low level ones. Just south of Wavy Willards is a good place for them.
---
Agree totally.  I do the SBQ events for the XP gains and the fun of the event.  I never hold my breath for a decent SBQ weapon drop.
---
It sort of respawns but not alot. I've cleared each branch as a runner then start back at the first branch and found two to three nodes spawned back. It get full amount it requires at least three runners.
---
I think that kind of geometry-change would be to much trouble performancewise unfortunately.
---
Before secret service armor, Scout Armor was the best balance of DR/ER (at least in my opinion).  With the polymer mod, its 45/30 DR/ER for limbs.  The chest piece is only 85/55, so a lot of people still prefer heavy combat with 86/86.  Also, you buy the scout mods from MODUS, so you don't have to worry about crafting/scrapping to unlock everything.
---
Wait, does this work with super stimpaks too? Big if true
---
Gotta earn your way out of hell somehow, right?
---
We have an optimist. 1/2 of players lol.
---
Even when i saw the ring of fire effects of nuclear winter turning all textures black and scorched, removing grass, i was like why didn't they use that ?
---
I like combat better myself but for my pvp character I have a full set of assassins but it‚Äôs scout, tho I‚Äôd seen people asking for scout so i was curious why. My preferred is BOS heavy combat chest and studded heavy leather limbs but unlikely to get a full set of that
---
Aye men to that brother, shits so whack üòëüòíüò©
---
Or, oh idk, have it as an instanced load zone lol?
---
MODUS is the computer thing in the bunker?
---
Because Bethesda.
---
I have had several copies. Scrip, sadly, since they are not really good. A bloodied knife does way better.
---
IIRC it's in lights but in the tab with the atom shop lights.
---
With  the nuka cola lamp.
---
I'm a bloodied build, I would instantly leave the team if someone shares rad sponge or sun kissed. I don't share perks that halve other people's damage lol
---
It could be an alternate version of the frog in a jar. Otherwise, I'm guessing it'd be in floor decor or misc.
---
Classic fallout when your asking wether something is a bug or feature üòÇ
---
And this is why after 2k hours I havent played in weeks. Im sick of grinding for shit cheaters just dupe in the thousands negating my hard work and making said item worthless.(Not a good feeling at all.) Like the NW rewards I literally went to work on more than one day with 2-3 hours of sleep to complete and they leave a bug in game during 2xp that rewards every events rewards in one run.(So not even just dupers fault.)
---
It would be nice if we had a site that everyone knew about where you can enter what platform you play on, your username, and what you need. So people can trade and give you what you need for free. Everyone wants money or something in return nowadays. There are some people that have extra items on their mules and would just give you one. You need to try and find one of those people.
---
Correct.  And the mods specifically are sold in the command wing, so you need to complete the quest where you gain the rank of General
---
Each person can only get about 40 ish from mining both sides, barely any of the nodes respawn after you mine them the first time.
---
So its best if you trade off gathering and defending. The mobs get harder as you add ore and increase the reward lvl, so if you want an easier time, wait til 3 people have gathered ore than all deposit at once.
---
Or you can spend the time you‚Äôd spend in NW grinding XP for the repeatable XP challenge. With all the new public team buffs, INT boosting chems &amp; foods, it‚Äôs not particularly hard to do. Normally you only need to hit that repeatable 3 times and you‚Äôll get more SCORE than the NW daily.
---
If you don‚Äôt like NW and the NW daily is something done in a few minutes, then go do it, stick around for a match or just go guns blazing after it‚Äôs done. If it‚Äôs a long one, do the XP. It‚Äôs your choice, nobody is forcing you to do anything.
---
Yeah cause that sends a good msg.
---
They got Perfect Storm and they DO want to set the world on fire?
---
What's wrong with the Screaming Eagles skin?
---
Create a new character, they all start at level one in NW, then ditch and use a new one when leveling gets tough., Same as levels for the level challenge, you get to level 2 without leaving the vault.
---
yea, don't listen to him. This event is horrible.
---
the legendary system was different in 4
---
I have a few.
---
I am not a scrip hunter, but I have received several 3 star fixers. Sold a Junkie's and an antiarmor one for 15k each. 
---
I remember scripping a Nocturnal one, and I keep a furious faster fire one with my commando, modded to shoot .38. 
---
Just be patient.
---
It's in the same category as the standard Lightbulb (and other hanging lights).
---
And they'll be back after an essay.
---
Depents on what perks u play. U should focus on one weapon Type like Heavy guns or rifles
---
No possible to trade or drop, its either the quest or bullion reward only.
---
Another item needs your help! Here I'll download the tracker on your map!
---
Well... I asked for it :3
---
N0
---
That sucks, I lucked out and got my junkies on my 2nd roll.
---
Thx :(
---
3000 caps is nothing if you want to finish the stupid quest and badge thing. 
---
Having said that, I sell all plans for 50 caps. Whatever the plan, except fixer, plasma grenades and Chems.
---
It's curious how that changed. It took around a year for us to get any handmade skins. It was a massive complaint throughout the first half of 2019 that one of the most used weapons in the game didn't have any skins. Then we finally got a handmade skin and everybody rejoiced. And we got another almost identical one. And a third. And a fourth. And two more in the past month. Now people are complaining that we don't have fixer skins, i.e that the combat rifle ones don't work on the fixer. Although combat rifle still needs an atom shop skin, only ones so far are event/season exclusive
---
Thank you :(
---
I once had a government supply drop follow me for a whole 5 hour session. Every time I would fast travel it would appear behind me wherever I loaded into. Even in the overseers house. It was never lootable. I laughed so hard every time I fast traveled that my friends in Discord thought I was losing my mind.
---
I can't even get my girlfriend to play the game any more lmao.
---
Of course, if you wanted two shot they‚Äôd all come up bloodied.  
---
If it helps, I‚Äôm having the same (bad) luck.
---
yes! had this happen to me. Thought I was losing my mind.
---
Once I completed it for myself and fasnacht started, I stopped doing his. Mainly because I would forget and then right when I‚Äôd lay down to go to bed I‚Äôd remember so eventually I just said screw it... some day he will get that gauss shotgun though lol
---
Clipping issues, copied animations not working properly on some attachments, some moving parts don't move, and I believe it also has some issues with the sights. I didn't buy it because I saw all the warnings not to, but somebody must have made a full list
---
You lose access to the tent, you can still make scrapboxes but you can only take stuff out of it not put things in it.

Full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and junkies for big fights

So cool to see I wasn‚Äôt the only one playing the game for me and my SO lol

Nonsense.  The 3\* nocturnal lead pipe is a myth.  Far too powerful to be held in the hands of mere mortals.

So that's why I couldn't sell that legendary armour for scrips. The more you know.

Damn lucky you lol

I don't get post like this, who are you thanking by making a random post on here?

Here‚Äôs my upvote

Yeah man at least we‚Äôre not alone :)

The only thing you are correct about is pedantic and that you are how ever your still wrong.  Now back to grinding for gold I'll wait for the ding go ahead and get your dong sugar
---
tl/dr - The Sons Of Dane Compound is a great place to farm for bobbleheads.
---
If/when this challenge comes back, I highly recommend the Sons Of Dane compound as a farm. I have always had really good luck farming for bobbleheads, magazines, plans and scrap in general here.

There are 2 bobbles, 2 magazines, 1 plan, 1 recipe and lots of cans and junk to scrap here.  I find it already looted quite often, so a bit of server hopping is usually required. Having 1st helps but server hop enough on public servers and I'm pretty sure one of the bobbles will pop up for you at one at the locations here. I farmed almost all of my mags and bobbles here well before I was a 1st sub. 
---
One of the bobbles can be found in the main house at the right from where you spawn in.  There is a bobble on 2nd floor to the left of the terminal on the desk.  There is also a magazine to be found in the basement of this building too.  It is on the little table that has the microscope on it.
---
The other bobble can be found to the right side of the main barn, where the cans, bottles, bowling pins, etc are all lined up sort of like a shooting gallery.  The bobble will be on one of the rows of cans/bottles toward the upper left side.  Also in this area a plan can be found.  Again to the right of the barn, right on the outer wall between the workbenches will be a crate with a plan on it sometimes.(and a food item of some sort, usually)
---
The 2nd magazine can be found under the little guard tower on the left, just after the fence, from where you spawn in.
---
The 3rd mag and the recipe are in the main barn.  The mag is on the table to the right as soon as you walk into the big main barn doorway, toward the corner of the wall.  The recipe is on the bar/counter toward the back left on the first floor, again as you enter from the main barn doorway.
---
I show up, die, respawn, die, and then the event finishes and I get a reward.
---
Once, I saw the Sheepsquatch.
---
I have the card to turn in and activate the event, but I have no idea how the event works after multiple attempts.
---
Thank you!  i'll look into it.  I've also been trying to figure out the heavy guns that everyone is using to do the crazy damage i've been seeing
---
oh lordy lord
---
Actually, no. Many have perma bans and some like myself are still ‚Äúunder investigation‚Äù and still may get permanent bans.
---
I‚Äôve have been playing since launch. I have gotten drills. Gotten useless item after item from the purveyor. In fact, I‚Äôve gotten two pieces from her that was better than I had at the time. 
---
I‚Äôve been running with the same melee weapon for 120+ levels, it‚Äôs that good and it‚Äôs not bloodied or junkie.
---
I have not gotten the fixer plan from encryptids, my friend had twice and gave me one. Same with the s'mores recipe. My friend got it twice before I ever got it. The first fasnacht, I was lucky to get multiple berets. This year I was lucky to get the beret and the deathclaw. 
---
I regularly have to find ways to spend caps because I get close to the limit once or twice a week. I don‚Äôt even bother trying to clean out vendors for their 1400 caps each day because o don‚Äôt need too. I literally sell that much from my vending machines.
---
I‚Äôm fact I think the game needs more cap sinks like buying cards! 
---
My second attempt at making a plasma caster was B2525.
---
I‚Äôve experienced all the same bugs as other players though not with the frequency they claim.
---
The numbers of hours don‚Äôt mean anything accept to try and say, my hours played means I get to be right. So the old hairs line is bullshit because that would include me. So that's why I call bs on so many of the reasons and peoples excuses. The game isn't hard. The stuff people are claiming they need, isn't true. 
---
It's a game. Not work. If you approach it as work, then you are going to end up with problems. This is entertainment. Not life. Acting like you are insulted or someone did you wrong because you didn't get a uber weapon drop and is the problem. It's that entitled attitude that you deserve to be rewarded for consuming entertainment.

Fixer plan, Imposter Sheepsquatch outfits, and up to 10 minutes of infinite robot spawns with full XP and standard chances of being legendary. Those are the big draws.

In the training vault at Vault Tec university and there is a weight room at the motel between Flatwoods and Wayward.

There are three pylons, three different players must each activate one pylon once all three pylons are activated you can then damage the imposter. Please people activate the pylons. You will know when you need to because it will be a quest objective and show you which ones aren't active.
---
Fed76 prices are more accurate if you take the lowest value and cut if in half.
---
All Silos have a gym full of Lead. Also if you want loads of lead, use excavator power armor and go to Lucky Hole Mine and collect the ore. Can easily get over 1000
---
Happened with a regular scorch beat for me yesterday. The last shot landed and it fell and silas I ran to it to get loot I hit the end of the map.
---
Then as I'm wandering back to a train station it fell on me... with the loot.
---
Dont fix this bug :).
---
At the beginning I also picked the perks random, but as you said they‚Äôre very important.
---
1. There are some perks that you should pick in every style you play.
---
e.g. Perks that give you more carry weight so you can carry more stuff (Ammo, junk)
---
2. But the most important ones are those that fit into your style. So at first you have to figure out what kind of player you are. Do you often play in power armour and use heavy weapons?
---
Then make a heavy weapon build.
---
Do you play sneaky and use weapons like the Fixer?
---
Then make a ‚ÄûNinja‚Äú build
---
Every kind has build tutorials on YouTube :3 .
---
When you often use the Handmade rifle. I very recommend getting every ‚Äûcommando‚Äú perk ;)   .
---
One person can activate 1, 2, or all 3.
---
Water wookie üòÅ
---
It really cool when they fall on your tent and it is kinda like camouflage. lol
---
I just got it for my combat rifle. It looks bland and dirty. I prefer the default skin.
---
And while we are at it, power armor display cases
---
I found one in the mezzanine level of the top of the world.
---
Funny of you to think you'll see anything other than a floating stimpack. Just ignore the fact the bush moved to you to administer it
---
Isnt This a Bug? I have been waiting for it to be patched because 3* legendaries should drop 3* legendary items.
---
To cause so many deaths in a single stroke is the mark of a true leader.
---
There‚Äôs some when you go up the elevator at the moonroail elevator! Go out of the elevator and round the cornor, go through the whole where the train is and there‚Äôs loads of lead weight and bags of concrete on the floor, I believe you get at least 70 lead scrap from the ones up there.
---
Well... my mate also nuked everyone so the match ended drawn :3
---
Congrats
---
... damn synth
---
Spot on but I think it's the Leader Of The Pack event you're thinking of.   I look for this event every time this 3 legendary challenge pops up.  This event starts up fairly often too.  Or if you're impatient, server hop till you find it.  Easy-peasy.
---
I hate that you can't put the beer steins on an actual beer stein display case. I settled for thee wooden and three metal steins I found in the Helvetia buildings. It's something!
---
Also in the house at the lighthouse upstairs. 2 chances.
---
One player can get to 50 give or take in the allotted time, about 20 total from one run of the four tunnels. Each player gets their own spawning ore, you don‚Äôt share, it appears for each player simultaneously. So if 2-4 grab ore at the beginning, you could hit 100 before the event is even halfway done.
---
Awesome...yeah, I'm usually playing in Power Armor, but I also do it because it seems to protect me the best for my current messed up build. LOL  
---
I've been watching YouTube videos almost non stop while playing, but i haven't seen any real recent videos on what the current meta builds is or what seems to be working best....then as you guys have pointed out, there are several styles of play and i haven't even figured that out yet.  LOL  Heavy and Power Armor seems to be where I am currently though.
---
Ah, so you need a bloodbug farming location for the blood sac then?
---
prison yard, they reset for the event , just get there early
---
Pretty much the gist of it.  The three pylons just need to be active, doesnt have to be three different people though.  One person can do all three but even a single pylon drains your health super quickly.  If you show up with troubleshooters armor, super stimpacks and the perks that make stimpacks work better and more quickly it's not that hard to take all 3 by yourself.  You need to be prepared though if you are going to do it.
---
Main problem is probably that most of the game was copy/pasted from fo4, so had minimal anticheat systems built in, and all that was just kinda tacked on top.
---
On PC. I think Bethesda said that as long as it's harmless then they wont ban you or anything
---
Sounds like he actually watched over your junk bag until you returned, he was doing you a solid. The flux vanishes if you die
---
Excavator PA + "Lode Bearing" event = more lead than you'll need for a hot minute
---
I imagine it will be in season 2 rewards.
---
No really. You can find some at the county fair grounds in the Halloween decorated building near the road.
---
Its not hard to see how it actually is. Its hard to see why. Some weapons have no buisness being in the legendary loot pool. Almost as bad as the drills of old are the shit weapons they delute the pool with making it a disappointment to see a 3* 99% of the time.
---
There's an invisible enemy that you can only really see the eyes of.  You need to have all 3 pylons activated at which point the enemy is able to be harmed.   Without pylons activated, you can't harm it.
---
Being a conduit of a pylon causes you constant harm, the enemy will attack people randomly.  You need to have pylons activated and kill it to get the rewards while avoiding Mr gusty and co.
---
Most people play it for fixer plans that go for about 8k a peice.  Usually you get a fedora.
---
You werent already?
---
Don't lost hope. I was trying to improve my ss uny armor to 3* and did not get any pieces in 6 weeks while playing every day. Yesterday evening i rolled 2 nice 3* pieces. Go figure.
---
It‚Äôs very expensive and only available in the endgame, but at the moment I‚Äôm creating this build for myself.
---
https://youtu.be/0AwsB-CuQrs
---
Honestly just make the mob "legendary" with different chances at dropping 1, 2 and 3 star items....
---
Would Bethesda consider my sexy elven big booty harem mods harmless? /s
---
That's cool, probably going to download this then.
---
Lol. I have plenty of that in my punch bowl. It would be nice if they keep the colors and ap effect only. The first time I drink that, I fast traveled to a bunch of super mutant üòÇ
---
The beauty of being a Bush Wookie is that I can do something else while letting my character Rank Up.
---
Started NW when the Season started, only hiding in bushes (and occasionally large bodies of water with Aquaboy) and I'm just about to hit Rank 93.
---
Lately I've found most of the veins in lode bering don't work. I figured it was a patch so people will focus on keeping the robots repaired.
---
Its best done with a decent amount of people (it recommends 8), or atleast a few well geared players. Once you start the recall process, you will have a countdown until the Sheepsquatch appears. Once he spawns (He spawns invisible and is invulnerable while he is invisible) another timer will start, once that timer reaches zero, the Pylons will become active and players can activate them to become a conduit. 3 players can activate 1 one each or one player can activate all 3, it doesn't matter, but as long as the pylons are active, the sheepsquatch becomes vulnerable. At this point everyone should go ham on the sheepsquatch. In amongst all that you have to deal with exploding eyebots and anti armour gutsys etc.  Thats the general gist of it anyway.
---
The gause shotgun is pretty op if you want free kills. Just spec into shotguns and explosives
---
This.  Server hop till you find the event. 3 real easy legendaries to satisfy this challenge.
---
Bethesda could use this image to advertise the game. It's a really great shot!
---
The other day I found a camp on the Whitespring lawn that had about eight of them. 
---
I picked the lock on one and the camp owner and his friend attacked me, so I killed them both, but died in the process. 
---
I respawned and came back, and they were standing guard at the ammo machines, so I lockpicked another one and they attacked me again. This time I managed to kill them both without dying, after which I picked the locks on all the machines. 
---
When they respawned again, they disconnected the power from the machines to prevent me from taking the ammo, but didn‚Äôt bother attacking me again. 
---
One of them sent me a message asking me why I was stealing their ammo and killing them, so I just told him that exploiters deserve to get raided. 
---
They clearly didn‚Äôt want to fight me again, so I just stood there by the ammo machines and wasted 15 minutes of their time while eating my lunch, until they just decided to leave and go do events instead. 
---
All in all I had a good laugh, and a solid excuse to initiate PVP, which I never do on a regular basis.
---
Lol, but also make sure that I'm right. I dont know for sure since I play on Xbox, I dont want you getting banned lol
---
Hahaha damn, I did!
---
So far my highest level is 8. I noticed I still have some bonus items to unlock, maybe from the last even since it has ghillie suit, so it's nice to see them pop up once in a while after 2,000 XP.
---
Edit: also just noticed psychobuff isn't increasing my damage numbers in the pip boy, the numbers jumped up appropriately then went back to normal after about 2 seconds.
---
Edit 2: nevermind it is working, the jump in numbers I saw was it actually stacking twice then quickly correcting itself.
---
That's the obvious answer, but Bethesda deliberately avoids it. They did the same thing with the "mole miner pales". The rarest container only gave a slightly less terrible chance at the rare items. The solution should've been to make the rarest ones rarer and give them a 100% chance at one of the rare items.
---
Fallout 4 only had 1* items so the whole mechanic works differently. Items weren't leveled either, so in total the chances of getting a good item were much higher. Especially if you knew how to reload a save until you got the item you wanted.
---
Its not harmful in any way other than being mildly annoying and is helpful in a lot of situations so i agree.
---
My understanding is that most of them are on a timer, set to trigger every so often. These times, however, seem to be different on most servers, so they do indeed seem quite random. Others may be actually random, I‚Äôm not quite sure, but then there‚Äôs other ones that only trigger when a player enters an area or completes an action. Sometimes it seems like a server will have lots of good events, other times they seem dead with nothing going on. If you‚Äôre trying to find a specific event, consider hopping till you find a very active server that seems to have lots of players, events groups, or exclamation mark events on the map
---
Seriously though, strip lighting seems to be the best. Or uplighters on the floor shining upwards.
---
You need to hit around 1000 damage to receive the full reward and loot her corpse, how much do you hit her for?
---
Yep. The RNG is just a handy excuse. Many people are fed up with RNG, but are decent enough to avoid hacks and dupes. Cheaters/hackers/exploiters always do it for the powertrip and because of their lazyness to do even most basic tasks in a game. This is not specific to 76 either. Many games out there have exploiters who always have a game system as a handy excuse.
---
How is a 3* enemy more difficult than a 1*?
---
I think I remember from BETA days they got to regenerate once per star, but that's definitely not true anymore (if my memory serves me at all).
---
Do they flat get more health or something?
---
Fucking cry babies man.
---
Eating bubblegum has been a part of challenges for months now.
---
None, if they're not at the event they don't get a reward, grouped or not. Some people will join groups and go vendor hopping, its free fast travel.
---
Please explain how it's wrong, since it appears the term existed before the labor movement. And what the hell does that second sentence even mean.
---
I've hopped back to my camp and found it in one of my enclosed buildings.  lol
---
Sadly that method didnt work at all, never merged. So had to use this method.
---
Its ~10 caps to buy, support your local shop keepers.
---
It gets easier as you rank up. Change out your perks and try some new things! I‚Äôm overseer ranked 56 and I only started winning after rank 30, imo mostly thanks to perk cards like frog legs, bloody mess, and speed enhancements
---
Yeah in I'm starting to dislike this challenge. My party was full of bush camper. I killed some enemies to protect their bush. Then someone shoot me in the back. üòÇ
---
Yeah what you said
---
Most of my levels came from the Double XP weekend. Fortunately I was was off the whole thing, I work 16 hour days with 3 days off a week at the county hospital  and it lined up that was. So I  just played 76 for most of the weekend. I think i went from 46 to 90 something with sometime in Ghost of Tsushima.
---
And since to address that past bit, it's not really free content. You right you can pay to skip levels, which some people will. Just because its in a " Free" gamepass doesn't mean Bethesda shouldn't have to put in effort to put out quality items. This lack of care is evident in alot of the stuff they release. And since people ARE going to pay to skip levels, Bethesda should be putting more effort in their content.
---
I can be disappointed with it because it just shows once again the Bethesda isn't taking their time to iron out the issues with the stuff they release, and everyone knows that they can release some top notch stuff. Most of the stuff in this pass is just filler to pad out the couple of nice things. They can do better.
---
I agree. I feel like as a community we all realized that the buy three things is going to be a common score challenge and we want to help each other out.
---
I put ammo, some plans, water, clothes, junk (good junk) and non perishable food items in for 1 cap. Not for profit. If someone buys my stuff then they are saving me a trip. Which is pretty cool.
---
Once again, this is the best community I've ever seen for a game. This is just more proof of that.
---
Drag the bar with the mouse to roughly where you want and then use the arrow keys to fine tune it. Looks like there is a  [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148)  you can use for typing it in though, I haven't used it so don't know how well it works.
---
There is a mod for it, i don't remember the name unfortunately
---
Idk about that. I bought like 60 of them from a player vendor for I wanna say 3 caps each. I've got like 250 bobby pins now so Ive stopped buying.
---
Synths haven't been perfected yet I see.
---
An excuse is all it really is. If they want to run around with hacked weapons, they can play fallout 4. They are actively choosing to do it in this game instead. They can use excuses like "well bethesda should have fixed it" or "it's their fault I didn't get this in enough play time". They can cope with it saying things like "the game needs us or else you wouldn't have your god tiers". But at the end of the day, the game is designed for grinding. It has no end-game content other than rolling for the rare things you want. Most people knew what they were going into when they got the game. It's the small minority that doesn't like it, and instead of playing a game that better suits their tastes, cheats in this one to try to force it to be what they want
---
Silver linings :)
---
There are some lesser "banwave", but nothing big or fancy. The duped weapons are still in the game, cheaters/hackers infesting PC version of NW, etc.
---
I would be happy if they delete all and every duped weapons/items, permaban all and every dupers, cheaters, hackers, bug abusers, glitchers, but this day never be here, sadly.
---
The easiest place to go for that is the prison yard of eastern regional penitentiary. There‚Äôs some in the silos as well.

Create a new character.   By the time she's done talking to the gal in Wayward and you've created one weapon and one piece of armour, it's done.     Very fast.
---
Has it really been always? I feel like some update last year caused it and it's been around since then, but I don't remember this happening in the early launch days
---
not being sarcastic, genuinely curious... but what concessions do other passes give that this one doesn't. The only concession I can think of is paying to rank up. Also, are those passes free or paid? My argument is why should MY spent time be of less value than someone who plays occasionally. Why should someone who put in 50 hours of game time be able to reap the same rewards that I spent 300 hours for? If you want something offered, you put in the requisite grind to get it, or you pay to make up for the time you didnt play.
---
It is a fun thing (and well deserved punishment), if you use the exploit by you own. If someone placed in your camp, thats the "not fun" part...
---
It was a challenge back when we were getting atoms still. Nothing new.
---
They should make them like radrats, they‚Äôre in the ground until you get close and then they unburrow, but they don‚Äôt every go back underground
---
Hell I fought a two star bear and after dropping his health it vanished like a mirage was super pissed
---
Wait, so this isn‚Äôt a bug? I honestly thought that every time I got a one star legendary weapon from a three star enemy it was like a server issue or something.
---
It would be too much, it's already hard enough to see people with all the foliage everywhere. At that point, most matches would end up running the timer until the ring swallows up the entire map, even WITHOUT a lobby full of afkers
---
Yeah if someone else does it, I'd file a ticket.
---
I am sure Bethesda doesn't really care. What you miss on the Seasons Board they can just sell you later for Atoms. I believe it is all cleverly planned!
---
If assets aren't placed they can't check your camp against assets in game.
---
Don't worry, they have a few dozen more in their stash
---
Why is duping bad if it introduces more high tier items into the game?
---
What?? How much XP did you get? üòÇ
---
Yes! It really pissed me off when I got a 1*bloodied lead pipe from scorchbeast queen.
---
I thought wastelanders had been fairly successful and brought a lot of people back along with new players. That isn't the case?
---
Depends on what you mean by screwed.  You will most likely have to grind exp and play for a couple extra hours if you want to complete it.
---
Well now you've got to share that photo
---
Yeah, at the end of the quest line you'll get a fixer. I think it's always level 30 though. And the plan is a rare drop from encrypted. Are you on PC?
---
Better than going to a camp to buy 3 ammo every day . That crap has niw a stable daily.boring
---
Double check that your strength isn't negative... mine is so negative from mutations that even with 4 uny armor pieces online it's only 11
---
Which is why they should implement something to check whether or not your camp can be placed
---
Cheaters got unbanned earlier in the week, if you're on PC chances are they're all using their beam splitter handmades or 10mm automatic sniper rifles. If you're on console, they're using all the bloodied ffr guns that got duped and handed out willy nilly for the hundredth time

While the bobblehead one took more effort, I just went to three locations on a single server, and eventually found one. Bobbleheads aren't hard to find if you know where to look- the Agricultural Center has 2 spawns in it, Sons of Dane compound has one, the obstacle course south of Overseer's camp has one on the highest tower. There are, like, five other guaranteed respawn points, too, but I never have to go and check them since I usually find one within the first three.
---
Killing legendries isn't hard, either. Go to Whitespings, hop to all the fissure sites for Scortchbeasts, launch a nuke- each silo has at least one legendary in it, not to mention the Queen is a guaranteed 3-star. Encrypted is a player-activated even with a guaranteed legendary. Getting 3 is a cakewalk.
---
I have yet to have a daily challenge set I couldn't complete in, like, an hour, with the exception of the constant daily of 'Level Up.' Most dailies are easy to complete, all they take is a little brain power to think of the path of least resistance.
---
Any word on this yet? Like let's change up the Atom system completely but not fix the missions bug üôÑ

Upper track lighting is good if you aim it well.   I‚Äôm out in the mire, too.

Well all I can say is it's shocking that vault tec chose you for 76 because your chromosome count is higher than your IQ

No ps4
---
I am having the same problem and it doesn‚Äôt let me remove the skin from the atom shop
---
You're a willy nilly
---
It's been really bad the last week... Has only disconnected me completely once, but several times I've had issues with server not responding.
---
Pretty sure I‚Äôm saying thank you to the people in my lobby, like it says in the title ya know. 
---
There‚Äôs always a chance that those players are Redditors, and it looks like this time, they were.
---
In gyms/ or fitness areas. Vault tec university,fire stations,silos have the most and they are kinda easy to get to.
---
If you're doing leader of the pack, head over to darling sisters right after.  You may get lucky and find a bobble head on top of the camper.
---
I believe you have to start with lying Lowe which will lead to the next quest, etc
---
Me: Dies
---
The Game: You will respawn in 10 seconds
---
Me: Dies again
---
The Game: 40 seconds it is!
---
Can i still find the sheepsquatch poster in the station
---
Unfortunately. I really wish they would fix the system so that you don't get rewarded for that kind of playstyle. It's already bad enough you have to put up with blatant cheaters that can get up to rank 100 without getting banned, then when you actually find a good match, half the lobby is afk. The only thing more frustrating than playing NW when you don't like it is playing it when you DO like it. If that doesn't scream poor design choices, I don't know what does
---
That's because he has a chance of spawning every #minutes since he's a random encounter.
---
Potentially a lucky nuke could yield even five or more Colossi, if there's someone there triggering the encounter every time the timer resets
---
Holy shit that sounds amazing! Is there any way to get involved? I‚Äôve never actually done a silo run or anything but I get involved with every scorched earth that pops up
---
It‚Äôs not a guaranteed spawn it‚Äôs a low chance to find it there. They spawn in any location with a specific type of random encounter and one of those happens to be in the overgrown grove
---
Gotcha - I can't really make you one then :(
---
It is but I had to restart the game, seems my character needed a refresh.
---
I sent you message
---
If it makes you feel any better, its a little difficult to use if you have certain perks like weight reductions. It will take up a lot of weight from that and perk slots. Also its expensive to wear and I can break easily.
---
I don't go out of my way for the challenges like that, but I always end up getting them anyway. The majority of these are things that will happen fairly quickly just through regular gameplay. Bobbleheads are everywhere, so are legendary enemies.
---
What they seemingly don‚Äôt realize, is if we don‚Äôt have room for anything else, we‚Äôre not going to buy anything else.
---
1260 is the discounted price, it used to be 1800
---
How would you check where something is before you connect to the server? Information has to be shared from both new server and player account before you can tell if there is an issue. currently instead of simply moving to the next server it gives you the option to play or not.
---
No! I tried to do that application first
---
With regrets I had to have that skin though
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hk3993/my_leadgrabbing_route_to_help_others/

Maybe a bit :(
---
ah shit no kidding?  Thanks for the heads up!
---
If you know it then what's the difference?
---
How did you draw that conclusion? I don't see anyone saying that.
---
If you want to say thanks to people that launch nukes, then just send them a message in game?

I think it's weird when people do this.

Had a Sheepsquatch fight a ScorchBeast. Took photos while hiding behind a truck. Best in my album!
---
ty man. tanky bastard :)
---
I made an alt named ‚ÄúPride &amp; Accomplishment‚Äù for this purpose. Unfortunately I think only my main character‚Äôs IGN shows in NW
---
But we usually get a prompt when an item will be destroyed if dropped? Is this not the case with weapons with skins?
---
yes please
---
Yeah I'm gonna try
---
Same places the other posters said. But yes, you can still do the mine thing, even without Excavator Power Armor. You‚Äôll just get half the amount as what you‚Äôd get with the Excavator PA. Having said that, go to Lucky Hole Mine and get the lead ore from there. You will end up with waaayyyyy more lead (once it‚Äôs smelted) than just picking up the barbells. Plus lead ore weighs significantly less than barbells so you shouldn‚Äôt have near as many troubles with being overencumbered and trying to fast travel. Hope this helps and that you stay safe out there in the Wasteland.
---
Yeah I'm deciding to use it for good so if you have xbox I'll give you ammo from it
---
What is an FSP? HE? Fucking acronyms
---
Stunning shots my man! You have the patience and an eye for some spectacular shots. Bethesda should be paying you to capture these and use it for their marketing
---
Did you raise a ticket?
---
Less time required to complete pass, progress banking usually up to a week so you can knock it out in longer sessions over a few days, or smaller sessions across the week, gaining progress via just playing the game rather than fulfilling arbitrary tasks.    
---
Rocket League is a good example of a good pass IMO.  You get big xp bonuses for the first 2 wins a day, and they bank up to 12 wins.  Unique items stop at level 70, then you get variations randomly on those items up to like 320ish.  I play once or twice a week for 3-4 hours and I'm currently at level 299 with over a month left in the pass.  It also does have little challenges, 6 a week, and you can complete them at any time during the pass, could even do all 13 weeks worth on the last week if you wanted.  Entry fee of 10 bucks, but you earn 10 bucks in credit by like level 100, which is super easy to reach, so it pays for itself after entry fee.    
---
Being free doesn't excuse 76's pass to be so unfun and demanding, imo.  I'd rather pay a reasonable fee up front for something that just rewards you for playing naturally.    
---
Another informative example is MTG Arena.  The pass as originally designed required daily log ins like 76 does, but players gave a ton of negative feedback and they changed it so you could get your weekly xp in a few days a week with longer play sessions instead.
---
God that weapon sounds like a dream to me (shotgun/medic build). I'm so sorry you lost him.
---
static. Swing Speed/Martial Artist. Just like Vampire's is static.
---
Good luck! ‚ô•
---
Thanks üòÅ
---
Yeah it will come some day. Just gotta be patient. I‚Äôm glad you managed to find some nice pieces :)
---
I posted it a while ago on r/fo76FilthyCasuals : https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/ejhvgh/i_made_art/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

HE?
---
Fissure Sight Prime.
---
HE is the collosus. Literally he. Not a ancronym
---
There is also one on the kitchen counter of the Overseer‚Äôs House. Next to the pumpkin pie.
---
Don‚Äôt sacrifice your job or your health for this game.
---
I gave up after searching about 12 different places. Screwed up part was the day before that challenge I found 2 at the Generals Steakhouse.
---
I've had this problem as well. I don't know your situation, but I found connecting with an ethernet cable solved my problems. Hope this helps :)
---
I am on PC, and I have collected a hell load of ammo since BETA, aswell scraps to craft them. So, no, thank you.
---
So you make good points.  However I stick by my first comment.  This is a FREE legendary run.   Doesn‚Äôt matter if you can skip levels,  you can do the entire run for free, as I am. 
---
You are entitled to your opinion.  But get a little perspective as seeing how other games treat their customers, 300 bucks for a skin pack and here you get 100 levels of free stuff that you can get by simply playing the game.  
---
Relax buddy, don‚Äôt post on a thread if you don‚Äôt wanna be disagreed with.  And based on your response, the entitlement is obvious.  Proving my previous point.
---
Yes and the one for the party (nukashine) and Pioneer scouts
---
It was a *worse* challenge back then since you had to chew 5.
---
wat
---
It charges a few days before renewal. Wait 3 days
---
Hi there! I had the same problem. I fixed it by doing the ‚ÄúEarly Warnings‚Äù and ‚ÄúReassembly Required‚Äù main quests. If you finished Rose‚Äôs quests you should have ‚ÄúEarly Warnings‚Äù.
---
You‚Äôll be brought back to Rose when you finish the two quests and it should fix that annoying bug.
---
Because high tier items are meant to be rare. It negates a lot of grinding honest players do.
---
Me and a buddy took 30 mins to kill a 3 star sheepsquatch. I got a 1 star fucking left raider arm. I was hoping to atleast get a 2 star item.
---
If you ever need help with a challenge like that let me know, did it in 5 minutes on a private world. I can load up a fresh world for you.
---
It's worth the grind frankly. Totally overpowered. My 4/5 unyielding ss armor is collecting dust (at least until I find a decent bloodied shotgun...). ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
What a twat.
---
That 1* nocturnal broadsider I got from the imposter sheepsquash was worth 5 scrip.
---
Mire or bust.
---
All ammo for 1 cap and home plans for 10 then weapon plans for 20 some times lower all depends on rarity
---
Do you have Vault tec camp skin?
---
Grinding is kinda dumb, ngl
---
If this challenge comes back - I find a route starting at the lighthouse, go across to alpine river cabins and then follow the road hitting the majority of the locations up to aaronholt homestead is a really good scavenging/bobblehead/magazine route.
---
Bruh. I like Nickleback.
---
my grumbling aboout the lack of radium skins is legendary in the discord i frequent :)
---
Yeah I'm glad the sub itself doesn't reflect the game.
---
I'll have to check out West Tek. Been striking out at the golf club, although everyone swears theres legendaries there
---
Thanks, I'll wait before submitting a ticket. Just was sure last two times its went straight in. Could be linked to lifetime achievements glitch?
---
When I am at max caps everything goes to zero caps, I don't needs 456 stimpacks.
---
It‚Äôs scary how we don‚Äôt know whether something is a bug or not
---
What Wade said.  Lots of dark, creepy spots in the Mire
---
But I do need 3000x 10mm! I hacked the Deliverer into the game and *it gives me orgasms each time I fire*
---
All they did was just reduce their spawn rate anyway without fixing the star ratings!
---
His friend and I had to reorganize one of the mule accounts last night. And by organize I mean we had to give stuff to 3 different characters (2 characters on his other mule + 1 character on my main) since his friend needed a character which wasn't super overencumbered. Which also means I can no longer put off creating the spreadsheet needed to organize both of his mule accounts + my own mule account.
---
RIP my sanity. üòÇ
---
Or if you open perk packs if you have them stored still then you get bubblegum from them also
---
Alas its an intended feature.
---
I have trouble even getting to someone to revive them, someone always beats me too. Good group of people out there!
---
I've found that it fails more often than it succeeds, so a group who knows the event is very helpful.  Otherwise make sure your server has a lot of high levels on it.
---
Typically find one sometimes two pry just server hoop
---
I wouldn‚Äôt suggest doing it solo.
---
Combination of Gamepass newbies and ban wave. But most got unbanned this week. However, I noticed a lot of regulars not logging on anymore. Game is certainly different now.
---
Oh no..
---
I am. Now the government has come clean we have UFOs and aliens visiting, I am still able to keep my hopes up.
---
I was told that the legendary drop chance was based on luck. I‚Äôve gotten a 1* from a 3* enemy while my friend got a 3* from the same one. I have my luck at 11 now and I‚Äôve been having the issue less. Could be a fluke but I think it could be true.
---
To me it looks like it's working as intended.
---
The ranks are:
---
 - Hostile (-2000)
---
 - Cautious (-1000)
---
 - Neutral (0)
---
 - Cooperative (1000)
---
 - Friendly (3000)
---
 - Neighborly (6000)
---
 - Ally (12000)
---
There's a YouTuber called Angry Turtle that has a video in solo'ing the Encrypted event.  He made it look easy but I have only managed to complete it with a 2nd player. One to act as a conduit, the other to kill the ISS. 
---
My biggest pet peeves if doing this on a public server is some random a-hole starting the event before you're ready then killing the ISS before you (who paid for the card) gets a shot in.
---
If attempting solo or with a buddy, I'd recommend a private server if it's an option.
---
May I give a blanket apology to those in Radiation rumble and I am blasting away with my gamma shotgun and don't even notice one-shotting a legendary ghoul.
---
Most of the time I am very careful to run up and kick them in the shins to make sure everyone gets a chance.
---
People can do it solo but not at that level and not without significant buffs etc. I am level 270 bloodied build. I can tank all pylons with buffs and stims but I can‚Äôt also fight at the same time reliably. Not solo anyway.  
---
I could if I changed my build, but it‚Äôs not worth it for one event. It‚Äôs the only big event that regularly fails for me because of XP farmers or people thinking they can‚Äôt tank even one pylon with their build.
---
Time to find a new girlfriend.
---
At that level, you will die if you do it alone. 
---
1. Check if you are on an active server before activating the countdown: aka many high-level players are participating in public events. 
---
2. Wait until the last minute before actually beginning the mission (you have to use the terminal to confirm the beginning) to let time to people to change weapons and armors and rejoin you. 
---
3. Brings stimpacks. A ton. Like really. If you have anti-robots weapons and armors it will help.
---
Edit: 4. You will stil die often and ridiculously lol. Just respawn and get back into fire, soldier!
---
level 58? no. 99% impossible, literally whole servers of level 200+ players have more of a chance of failing than succeeding since no one knows what to do, for some reason people have a hard time realizing they have to actually do objectives rather than just kill things in this game
---
The only difference is the health regen! And no during beta they only regened once!
---
I am level 92 on the board and I've done *one* NW challenge.  Decided farming XP was faster.
---
Same character? That's the XP curve that's in almost every game of this type.
---
I love people like this, I always try to help others but sometimes I run out of stims so I call another player over to help
---
sorry but I am a little bit lost. 
---
if one didnt miss any of the previous steins, how many are we supposed to have?
---
No not even during beta, they just spawned more often so we had more legendaries to get drops from!
---
That's how it's supposed to work. Cautious, neutral, cooperative, friendly, neighborly, ally. If it skipped friendly and neighborly and went straight to ally, we'd have all hit max rep with both in the first week.

Morgantown High school, fast travel there, go right and into main entrance, down the short steps to the skeletons. There are sometimes two there on the table. Be sure to check the floor there too
---
Being irradiated should at least count for triggering the animation
---
You looking for an away game?
---
Very nice.
---
Relax buddy? Your the one coming in hot, telling me to "keep my fucking opinion to myself." 
---
You can disagree all you want, discourse keeps the community alive. 
---
But this isnt entitlement, this is expecting better from a AAA company, who has shown that they CAN release quality stuff, but either is to lazy to take the time to make sure their items are working as intended, or just doesn't care enough to. You gonna tell me the someone went though the time and effort to model the Screaming Eagle or the Ghille armor skins, see all the glaring issues, and say " Well looks good enough for me," and your not gonna be even slightly disappointed in them?
---
Up the hill from hopewell cave is a cemetary
---
What platform are you on? I can help if you are on PC.
---
You‚Äôd probably get more traffic if you told people your platform and your GT.
---
Not true from other another post where someone was unbanned with 5 characters full of multiple dupes of various items. Sounds like an excessive exploit to me.
---
I am on pc
---
Encryptid is soloable if you have very specific armor pieces, finetuned build and god tier weaponry. And good amount of experience in the game. Reading your post i would not try soloing it if i were you.
---
Good point haha didnt realize I forgot that, thanks for letting me know.
---
Having the same issue. Prewastelanders you could find them. Now you can't. I mean I guess you could server hop for science and see if you get a spawn
---
Just make a new character every time this challenge pops up. Leave the vault and you are good to go.
---
I can hold all the pylons. ign is newt341.
---
this! 
---
a faster swing speed/90% weight reduction is the way to go.
---
i've gotten bloodied and junkie's on the minigun, still waiting for that furious faster fire rate :/
---
I gave up on hoping to get a decent legendary from an enemy I just trade in the random garbage the game gives me and buy form the purveyor.
---
Sweet. Thanks for the tip!
---
If you can grind it out to level 88, the atoms the run gives you can take your to 100.
---
Same on PC. Didn't check if it's the same on a different server, though.
---
I'd say no.  I've solo'ed the event a few times but unless you can kill the ISS in a few seconds with your gear, you probably will just die.   You need Troubleshooter's armor, a badass weapon/build, at least 20 super stims, the first aid perk, lots of scorchbeast meat, radshield and balls of steel.  If you can tick all those boxes, go for it.
---
I'd back this up.
---
Ok that's what I was thinking/hoping. I'm all for people joining me or a group but at least be there for the event and don't clog up other spots. This is good to know thanks
---
Doesn‚Äôt Rose actually tell you that ‚Äúany will do‚Äù?
---
I do it out of spite.  Like yeah brosicus people are gonna blow 250 caps on your daisy rug uh huh sure
---
Replied after testing and yes the item can get to level 50 if you wait till max level to retrieve it and the price for the item on the pricing tool is way high...
---
IMO the healing always seems delayed and not per hit. So my SS doesn't really heal faster than my non SS.
---
Level 3 does make a difference though.
---
sounds like suicide.  
---
perhaps a veteran in this game with a perfect build specific for that event and godly equip could solo it with lvl 58. but if you have to ask, no, no chance. 
---
just give it a try. make sure to have no junk with you, start it and perhaps there are some people showing up and it might succeed. if not, doesnt matter, its one of the hardest events at all.
---
That Rocs. Nice shot.
---
I‚Äôm working on taking fallout from todd
---
Lol at *half*. Maybe 5% banned at most, steam showing same high online as before, and Xbox chart
---
They‚Äôre not talking about that one, a similar one like at the ammo workshop; exploit.
---
You could just accept failure like you usually do
---
Works fine.
---
Nah I love her too much aha.
---
investigate the area. find a wire outside and follow it.
---
Where are the dupers when you *need* them?
---
Yeah there is a story behind it.  Or you can google it and find the answer.  Its been there for a bit.
---
Wipes are just bullshit rumors, I got unbanned and kept 20+ duped weapons. Given its my first time getting banned an I didnt even do a quarter of what most people did lmao.
---
I hope he gave you something in exchange for your efforts! I would've been siphoning off ammo and aid items. ;)
---
As long as I don‚Äôt apply I should be good? Claiming it off the board won‚Äôt cause this problem right?
---
Never been down there before so it was a bit freaky
---
Will check, nice one
---
It‚Äôs an interesting little area, look around and give a listen to all the holotapes.
---
A friend of mine got "unbanned" but everything was wiped except his caps
---
So far one (the Fasnacht one) with two more on the way (one for Meat Week, and one at the end of Legendary Run)
---
Rather just find a oxhorn video, thanks
---
NP.   You can even press Y to skip the long intro to the game too, to make it faster.
---
Please let me know if it drops as well. I‚Äôm really interested as well. I would the full collection
---
I just want all of the skins for power armor ones to be added to the secret service one too.
---
oh, so I‚Äôm up to date. tks, m8
---
Apparently they will be making the dark matter skin work for the fixer at some point
---
That works too.
---
Decent event for experience and a good fight, especially if you're not specifically geared for it
---
- Get a recall card from any vendor (2k-ish caps)
---
- Go to the event site and start the countdown timer (has a cool down period if it's been previously fired on the server)
---
- Initiate recall when enough people have arrived (or whenever some helpy helperton decides to start it for you...)
---
- Kill a bunch of robots while waiting for the Imposter to arrive and for the pylons to become active
---
- Hold the pylons (can be done solo, but generally better to divide the health drain between more than one player)
---
- When all 3 pylons are held the Imposter becomes vulnerable and you can attack / kill / get loot
---
Generally speaking Troubleshooter's armor goes a long way to help in this event due to it being all robots
---
if i do they're usually single copies for 1-10 caps (no heads though)
---
Didn't think about that. Thanks for replying!
---
Yes. Only applying it causes your camp to disappear from the map.
---
I better come up with a name for myself then... literally those plans are like candy wrappers to me.
---
Oh yeah that will be a beast. I got a bloodied 10dwa gauss mini that is my main now
---
I love how I kill 3 stars and get 1 stars. Nonstop
---
I‚Äôm really interested in that plan. If you by chance get it can you let me know how much you‚Äôre wanting for it if I somehow don‚Äôt receive it by then.
---
No warning when the game glitches out and drops an item without your intervention.
---
Yeah, that's kind of the entire end-game of FO76 though lol
---
This. Not that hard to get. But yeah i dont sell it anymore though lol
---
H3110?111
---
This. Not that hard to get. But yeah i dont sell them anymore though lol
---
I drop ultracite and jet pack plans where I know no one else will ever find them, just so I know they wont end up in a vendor.
---
Red rocket flatwoods, under the counter...
---
No. No gold bullion items work with SD.
---
LOL sucks man.  I rolled a B3315 and an I40 in the first 10, but it took 185 rolls to get an unyielding SS left leg.  I spent nearly 400 modules to get the complete set.  Feel your pain.
---
Yep.
---
It shouldn't be.  Bethesda should put more effort into their game instead of just making it a complete grind fest, lol.
---
It's great when you meet a fellow bush wookie and have that unspoken agreement. I usually give them a little "dip dip potato chip" and go back to my hidey hole. 
---
Congrats on the win, Snake would be proud.
---
Damn. Cheers mate
---
I just make it a point to keep like 5 around at all times in my stash.  It's not heavy, and you often run across it in vendors, both stations and players'.
---
I put every plan I already own up for 1 cap, hoping a newer player might come and get themselves some good deals. I know most of the plans in the game so I‚Äôm honestly surprised when I find one I don‚Äôt know
---
Don't think you need thumbnails. Just save them in the same folder and it should work.
---
Congrats! 
---
I saw it once, solo. Emptied a full auto magazine on it. Life bar did not move. I just noped away
---
Depends what you liked about 4. 
---
76 has:
---
A bigger map to explore
---
More enemy types
---
Better crafting/more weapons and armor
---
Less of a narrative (not that 4 had the greatest story)
---
More variety of quests
---
No companions that follow you on quests
---
No cut scenes.
---
It sucks yeah lmao. I‚Äôd die if I roll a b3325 gauss shotty. Really. I‚Äôll die. üòÇ
---
It will come eventually right. I mean here you are with 185 rolls already so yeah. Eventually lol
---
Yeah its a fun little feature. I have a bunch of brotherhood of steel pictures/concept art in there.
---
#BoSforLife
---
Thanks for the warning.  If this is how it goes with A Colossal Problem, I probably won't get too involved.
---
Is that after missing link
---
Exactly. That's been a challenge forever. Anyone not stocking  up is just plain silly.
---
Can you still get the mods plans somehow?
---
That‚Äôs great news! It‚Äôs telling you to keep it uninstalled and to play other better games!
---
You actually got Bethesda's 5\* lead pipe to the rear end.  Condolences bro, better keep that salve handy.
---
Lol, most of the mods are just quality of life stuff that‚Äôs client side. So no bans since it doesn‚Äôt effect other players or cheat. Just go to nexusmods and look up 76. There‚Äôs a lot there
---
***wendigo colossus got a *** rolling pin what kinda crap is that lol
---
If you're on PS4 I have a medics combat shotgun. It's 10% damage while aiming and 50 DR while aiming. So not great but I'll give it to you for free to hold you over till you find a better one.
---
Yeah I was frantically waving for folks to come into the trees. Lol I launched the nuke but everyone disappeared so I had no choice. Ha ha. I did same buffs I use on the Queen and helped a lot.
---
I did the same once, but that son-of-a-bitch SBQ spawned halfway into the roof and I didn't have marsupial at the time!
---
In Fallout76, even the bugs have bugs and thats a 
---
üëâBethesda Promise üëà
---
I always keep some in my store just in case someone stumbles upon it in need.
---
It is pretty messed up.
---
This guy coleinabox is on a scam list. Everyone watch out.
---
Woah!!! Thats some cool sh*t right there! Nice one!
---
why not just open a ticket and submit the video to them. why make it public.
---
Wrong. They got rid of the old system that gave Atoms for completing daily rewards and such. At level 200, I had a better time messing with those to earn towards items I WANT OR ARE AT LEAST COOL.
---
This new system is watered down with after thought rewards. Just to try and force you to buy Atoms now for cash.
---
The game died to me. I may check it out once they release the next fallacy patch.
---
Now to burst your bubble - I've sold dozens of Ultracite PA plans.
---
My idea of a God amongst Men is anyone who doesn't lecture other players on how to play the game.
---
May be crazy but it gets some damn good pictures
---
Its not a bug!!! They made it so you can loot scorchbeasts including SBQ, if didn't manage to do that, sbq dead body could fly out of the map sometimes, and people dont get loot, or drop inside toxic shit, where you instantly die and cant get loot. Should not happen if you loot it, but its bethesda üòã, still props to them to helping with looting
---
I always knew it sounded right, but seemed wrong. Finally now i know what the actual rule is thanks :)
---
I feel your pain. My sadness came not from devs, but I couldn't say no to my nephew when he asked to play. Deathclaw gauntlet,  +40% swing, DD full health,   ignore 50% armor. Miss you Sir SlashAlot.
---
I can use as much help as possible anyone who has been done wrong to by them is welcome to join. What would you say if I said they knew about all of it and are useing it to unconcentually test all of us to end up banning us after
---
I drop all my ultracite plans except the jetpack and I only have the gorilla and mega sloth head plans in my vendor. Am I a bad person
---
You don‚Äôt understand, I want to play this game, I also want actual help.
---
only those whitespring migrants and seekers for resources spot have this problem, Did you think atleast once about moving somewhere quiet?
---
No I do not, but that is completely besides the point. What I said was that nobody has to do anything in a game, hence the whole demonization of the game mechanic is misplaced. If OP realizes that, they can continue playing without having to take drastic measures and actually do miss out on stuff they would get just by enjoying the game.
---
My roommate and I have been playing for about a month now with the same problem. Would love a solution
---
All the time every now and then
---
Afaik, you need 3 individuals to reaches level 4.
---
I've also heard three can spawn at the Sons of Dane Compound!
---
What about the place where you can hear the woman scream every once in a while? I don‚Äôt remember exactly where it is but it‚Äôs somewhere in the forest region
---
Do you mean the university jumpsuit?
---
Also I would like a mini fridge style display for all the Nuka Cola I collect to show off TY
---
I would say so
---
What exactly does the jumpsuit say name wise
---
If you are a patient person that likes the fallout world the answer is yes.
---
The game is playable as a pre-alpha build. Disconnects, rubber banding, low fps, enemy health regenerating, losing progress just to name a few of the bugs you will encounter various times during a single day of play. All that with an all-star non existent tech support that never solves anything if even read your tickets at all.
---
But it is fallout, the world design is great and you get your nuke apocalipse fix if you miss fo4.
---
Edit: The usual fanboys of this sub will downvote every critique that scratch their emotional attachment to this game but it doesn¬¥t change the facts. The game is faulty, be prepared to a lot of problems if you decide to buy it. But the world design is great, one of the best around.
---
You could do it the annoying expensive hard way and crate the armor then destroy it
---
Actuallys
---
Greeeaaat.  I am nearly there, nice to know that the one thing I was actually looking forward to getting.. doesn't work. 
---
Bethesda has a habit of "Hyping Up" the images for items in the atomic shop.  I/E they show very colorful, vibrant photos in the first image but when you actually scroll through the other images they look nothing like the first one.  Especially power armor and weapon skins.   They've shown some weapons in GOLD but actually the skin is black when you apply it.  Not a hint of gold at all.  It's shady at the very least.  I hope this thing with the Dark Matter skin isn't that.
---
Except when it's the first time you ever encountered it and the falling scorch beast makes you need to change underwear.
---
I am currently unsure as I'm going to get it through a trade.
---
I've never been able to get it to work, no matter what server I'm on.
---
Again,  relax.  If you get this worked up about someone commenting on your thread your gonna have a heart attack early in life.  But all of your posts clearly prove my point of entitlement.  Take care!
---
Forever waiting for legendary vending machine to reset so I can scrip a few weapons to make some room. It would be really awesome if they had like a Purge where we had no cap for one day on scrip and could just sell everything in our inventory. I feel like I could manage it if I had a clean slate. I play way too much to ever be able to scrip as many as I have and get every day. They'll never do this and I don't expect them to, but a girl can dream.
---
Perhaps a new 4* legendary with a guaranteed 3* legendary drop would be ideal.
---
Yeah, you can certainly tell the first raiders evolved from corporate raiders based solely on their modus operandi. They're absolutely smarter than their idiot cousins from nuka world or even the blood eagles for that matter.
---
Oh..oh no
---
Do you have multiple characters, with one being bearded?
---
The beard from my main often appears on my unbearded vats sniper if I play on both in the same session.
---
Weird feature, like how the loading screen when you first change to a character, stills shows the level of the last played character til the game loads.
---
Wow, you sure showed me! I gotta go find a few ice cubes now.
---
Salty Tears: turns your Pure Waters to Salty Tears, gives 99% water AND food.
---
Can you give me some more, plesse?
---
Would rather an unlimited scrip weekend than an xp weekend
---
Nah I wouldn't be bothered by that. Now the people who have an entire vendor dedicated to nothing but mounted heads and label it plans. Yeesh.
---
The only jumpsuits that I know are worth anything are white powder, forest camp, a specific BOS one, and a few others but I haven‚Äôt heard anything about a rare vault tec jumpsuit
---
I know I shouldn't but my wife and I used to play nightly(work 2-11pm) anywhere from 3-12 hours. With the majority of days during events closer to 10-14hrs. We have just grown tired of the menu lag while crafting on our old characters and the BS grinds/ money pits built into the game. On a new character we notice it is nowhere near as noticeable.(And yes we dumped every note/holo and it makes no difference despite my preferred games being multiplayer FPS' and RPG' with no lag issue on any of them.)
---
Because its cheating and only pieces of shit do it
---
I took me less than a half hour to finish all the daily challenges last night. 45 minutes if you add in the NW challenge. It's really not that difficult.
---
You could also roleplay Big Boss, get your CQC on.
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
This is the way
---
Same happened to me yesterday, on the last one I stayed in the world and my camp was there. So the prompt must be bugged.
---
i found one of the rarest plans in the game for 50 caps the other day. I felt bad for buying it D:
---
Thank you for clarifying. I value your opinion but I don‚Äôt share it. I am of the mindset that enjoys the grind. I also don‚Äôt find the challenges to be unfun. I‚Äôve been playing Destiny since the D1 alpha and I was really excited to see how their season pass system was going to be. But tying pass ranks to XP was incredibly dull and it weakened the appeal of ‚Äúpass exclusive‚Äù gear knowing that the vast majority of the player base would have them as well. 
---
Now, a PAID season pass I am a little more understanding towards the casualness of it. If you paid for it, you should most definitely be reasonably able to earn everything. 
---
But a free season pass I think should be a heavy grind. Make the rewards more meaningful to those who earn it. 
---
I want to be able to show off the accomplishment with something that only a few have. A casual player should not be able to reap the same rewards that a dedicated player has. 
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of participation trophies.
---
I guess seeing where enemies are at, then again you could just spam vats
---
The jumpsuit itself is not. There is a plan for it that used to be rare, but I am not sure if that is still the case.
---
I can name my quad fire rate pump shotgun for n memory of your gun if that makes you feel any better.
---
AFAIK, no plans exist for scout armor.  Not even for crafting the armor itself...you have to buy those from MODUS too if you want a non-legendary version (or they're sometimes rewards from Enclave events).  And scrapping doesn't unlock mods either.
---
/r/cringe
---
I would be honored to know his memory lives on...
---
I can be see you have  nothing to add of further value. Good luck
---
I didn‚Äôt have the courage to admit it on here. Thank you for being brave for both of us
---
Sadly it kinda is. In the pics it looks like a dark blackish silver colour, but in reality its pure black. But I still really like it.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble. It sucks. But I'm sure they will fix it.
---
It took me about a half hour to finish everything last night. 45 minutes if you add in the NW daily. This legendary run is one of the few grinds I actually enjoy doing. Maybe it's because you get set rewards and not fight the RNG for them.
---
Server hop as soon as you finish it on one server. Even if it's not up on the new one, the chance is a lot higher that it will pop sooner than if you stay on the same server. 
---
I ran LotP 3 times yesterday just for some extra scrip.
---
By the way, I couldnt agree more
---
I switched to a stealth pistol build after picking up the gauss pistol, because it's relatively cheap and doesn't require a rep grind. Lovin' it.
---
Maybe the drawback to shield + pistol could be inability to use grenades, VATS, or ADS, only being able to aim like in third person, and shove with the shield.
---
Pretty sure they have to be team leader to be able to see their quests
---
no problem.
---
I server hopped after it but it didn't appear
---
Also: ‚ÄúSleeping In‚Äù Gives You a 4 Hour 10% XP Bonus over the 2 Hour 5% from Well Rested &amp; on Top of the First Order 25% XP Boost...
---
Yeah, unfortunately seasons does not do much to encourage player retention if you don't like whats available. The old atom system kept me more interested
---
His Brothers keeper the 2nd is now dominating the wastes in your honor.
---
Meanwhile the biggest budget eaters like turrets need buffed to be worth the budget. If a lvl 190+ camp is attacked by lvl 60+ raiders and a rare 80 scorchbeast the turrets especially rocket turrets shouldn't cap at lvl 25ish. I don't even want the explosive ammo mgs, just keep the turrets lvl tied to the players lvl. Have their damage or armor penetration much higher for mgs and lasers. Increase their range or give sniper and mortar turrets for enemies who snipe your camp.
---
Yup. He is
---
Downvote all your want, but there to much fuking crybabies. They made challenges so easy, that even monkey could do them. But wait, you need a little effort for that, like Google for 1min. Better get rank 100 after pressing some magic button.
---
That‚Äôs legit a good pic and terrifying
---
After i take what i need for scrip. Most the time I set my camp up in a mid level area and sell them for dirty cheap. Sell lower level ones for 50 to 100 caps fully modded when possible.  I get some caps and the lower levels get to experience weapons they may not otherwise find. Other times i spend a few minutes traveling around to low level camps and drop them for gift bags. 
---
Figured its better then letting them gather dust in my stash box or get lost to the void. New players get some good deals and i get some extra caps.
---
I have a lot of ultracite plans from my many SBQ fights. I sell every plan for only 1% of the games suggested price which I think is quite a bargin. I try to keep my inventory diverse and cheap but I can only sell the garbage that the game gives me so I'm sorry if my inventory is not up to snuff.
---
üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº
---
I‚Äôm that case, idk what to tell you, it‚Äôs Bethesda, so I‚Äôm not surprised
---
People should have the decency to play a game and not try to find ways to cheat. Its called having morals and dignity
---
It's just a game.  It's not esports or anything.
---
At a certain settlers reputation, you can buy it with gold bullions. A hell lot of gold bullions.
---
my vendor my rules my camp, geez entitled little brat.
---
Nope. And it's scandalous. 
---
Maybe get a bit of armour with 20% WWR
---
Not trying to add anything further, as I stated I stand by my first reply.  The entitlement of us gamers is getting out of hand when we complain about what a game gives us for free.  Take care buddy and have fun in the wasteland!
---
That‚Äôs weird. Rifles can easily weigh into the 20+ they are almost as heavy as some heavy weapons.
---
Oh god, is that the only way?
---
No perks.  Just weapon weight reduced by 20% armor pieces if you can find them.  Been a sore spot since lauch...
---
I hop in just to complete the score challenge. But I try to place good. I bush wookied it last night because I was doing other stuff while the match was happening and placed 6th. My best without bush Wookie was 12th. But my level is like 4 because I barely play.
---
No perks, just legendary effects. 90% reduced weight minor effect (3rd star) for weapons, and weapon weight reduced by 20% minor effect (3rd star) for armor pieces.
---
Built a CAMP around it and recorded for XBL and YT(Saint1701)...
---
PS4.
---
What plan was that?
---
Yeah, if you misses the settlers questline, this is the only way. Atleast, you can buy it... :)
---
Dang. Thanks for the quick responses. I take it that‚Äôs why 90% reduction is valuable on them.
---
I think its called Alpine river cabin. Their is a terminal around the area somewhere to let you change the sound effect.  Not sure if you can build their though. Its also got a bunch of low level ghouls in it.
---
Thank you for this information. Maybe soon i will have a use for those legendary scout armors after buying mods. 
---
I sweat the purveyor must have shares from the Scout Armors company lol.
---
None of the daily challenges are difficult to complete.
---
You wouldn't need a lot, because it's semi automatic only.   
---
The light machine gun is a .308 waste. 
---
I just like the look of the recon scope and the feature of tagging enemies.
---
Amen
---
Barbed walking cane
---
A 3rd bobble head spawns in the back of the barn on one of the concrete blocks with bottles on top for target practice.
---
I agree I have never or never will I dupe. But it's still in the game. If you arent going to thoroughly test your game dont get mad when people find a way to use an exploit, that's all I'm saying. I hate cheaters.
---
Oh man could you imagine...it would be amazing. Maybe an imgur or deviant art channel...thingy?
---
I love these ideas, especially the canteen, thatvwas the best preorder bonus that new Vegas had and it was so helpful.
---
I'm with you it's hard drug
---
Floater grenades are not worth enough to warrant paying gold to learn them.
---
I was able to build very close to Alpine river cabin in the area of the junk resource. I could still hear the screaming from that location. So as long as you are close to it,  you still get the screaming.
---
The only downside is that the area is just a forest with a road - there is not much that is 'spooky' about the visuals.
---
One area that is kind of spooky is that one large cemetery to the south west of the map (I forgot what it is called). It is the one that is next to Silvia homestead and next to a workshop. You can build in certain areas of that cemetery. Main downside is that it is next to a enemy spawn: Cultists.
---
Intelligence does not affect experience gain in 76
---
For 2 of the last 3 days, all but 2 of my dailies were already completed when I logged in for the first time and it‚Äôs not that someone hacked my account because I didn‚Äôt get the score points.  I‚Äôm on PS4.  I have lost about 10k score points!
---
Yep - It was a Blessing.
---
No it wouldn't. Fallout 76 isn't a JoJo game
---
AFKers and most Bush Wookies are free XP if you stumble across them.  Also, AFKers let the match start sooner.  The only problem with AFKers and some Bush Wookies is if they forget to turn off the Fill Team option.  PvP will always suffer when it has PvE rewards.
---
No.  I have bought them out of vendors for 10 cap.  Not talking about the vault suit, but the vault tec jumpsuit.  There is a quest that rewards the plans to make them.
---
There have been loads of threads that pointed out guaranteed locations.. why not just go to one of them?
---
I just have a bunch from perk packs
---
Good point. I was going to slap that Blood Eagle paint on my favorite 3\* handmade the second I got it. Now, maybe not...
---
None of the combat rifle skins work, despite having identical models.
---
Just hit this up today. Thank you
---
It...
---
It really isn‚Äôt
---
If it does, I‚Äôve been lied to by hundreds, and my testing was incorrect
---
Only other method is to buy it from Samuel for 4K gold bullion (if you want the helmet, add 1650 to that price tag) once you hit Friendly reputation with Foundation.
---
EDITED: Fixed a pricing mistake.
---
I've come across that in other places too - glassed cavern and sometimes lucky hole mine. Think it's a bug with the nodes.
---
IMO they can just leave the dupe in. Just set it up that if someone does it the account gets flagged. For first time offenses scrub the duped items. Each offense after that could be scrubbed items and temporarily suspended for longer depending on how often they have duped. Finally account ban after like 7 times or so.
---
Maybe [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hxrfrk/to_my_fonw_ps4_team/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
It doesn't say it does, but it does!
---
Definitely does. I have multiple experience boosting gear and perks and I can get well over 50% extra xp after using them. That‚Äôs why Bethesda is making xp more important. Int needed some love.
---
This is why I've always said vendors should have had their own stashes. That would have eliminated people buying stuff not up for sale from your stash.  I dont mind the budget size but some things like display cases suck up WAAAAAAAY to much budget, and still use stash space. Vendors, display cases, coolers should be their own stashes.
---
Could I not get my friend to sell it to me? Or would the game not let you sell it?
---
That was deep bro
---
It‚Äôs like Diablo 3, where at a certain point you‚Äôd just leave stuff on the ground if it wasn‚Äôt Anient or something you‚Äôd want.
---
I‚Äôve solo‚Äôed a few hundred times...

[Solo Encryptid - Gauss Minigun](https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs)
---
Troubleshooter Armor, Endurance Buffs, and a Vampire High ROF weapon
---
I‚Äôve gotten dozens of Fixer Plans, and sold or given most of them away.
---
Because it looks cool.
---
Can‚Äôt be traded or sold, not the plans for it either.
---
I agree but they cant get simple shit like skins right, I have no faith they could actually implement a system like that.
---
My other one is a female so i think thats why she isn't bearding
---
Can't be swapped, traded, or dropped.
---
Scorchbeast seem to have at least a 25% chance of being legendary. If I don't find any events I just FT between fissure sites and can usually kcock out that challenge in a few minutes.
---
That's the problem . You shouldn't have that gear at lvl 156
---
I have an instigating meat hook I use on trash mobs. After clearing out Wavy Willard's Water Park picking up the fuses for Wren, I got over-encumbered and dropped a bunch of weapons in a trash can. I figured I'd go pick them up later for the steel if I wanted to bother.
---
I did go back later, and was surprised to see I dropped my favorite ammo conserving meat hook in the can, too. Whoops! It is now favorited.
---
I believe that the easiest way to "solve" the economic issues of the most recent dupe is to debuff everything currently in the game by the functional equivalent of 2.5 levels (Your level 45 armor is now mathematically equivalent to Level 42.5), then re release that same armor but as a Level 50 which could be the functional equivalent of what would mathematically be Level 47.5 equipment.
---
Essentially, it releases items that are SLIGHTLY stronger than the current generation of weapons while making the current gen weps slightly less desirable. It's easy, from a business perspective it's cost effective and it re-incentives people to try for the next generation of gear without having to release new weapons.
---
Oh, no, it's definitely a bug, and like many here have pointed out already, I've seen it in Skyrim too, so it's very likely it's a long standing bug.  What strikes me as buggy *now* though is that it will continue to follow you throughout an entire play session.  Having the corpse drop somewhere lootable when first killed, even if it simply warps over to a new spot and looks completely ludicrous, is quite reasonable.  Having it continually drop around you for hours later is just odd...
---
I have been unable to get any buffs from Buffout for about 1 to 2 weeks now, with nothing having changed with regard to my build (mutations, etc.). Really annoying, seeing as how it usually helped my over encumbered arse quite a lot!
---
I get better drops off random ghouls and super mutants than I do from any of the boss battles. Did one violent night a month ago. Got a bloodied limb damage FR crossbow max level from a ghoul. Got a 1* nocturnal level 30 combat rifle from the nightstalker.
---
Wow that's so annoying, thanks for telling me
---
A real pos in my opinion. I hate cheaters.
---
Still all seem like 'pay to have an easier time' than 'pay to win'.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a girl on any online game before, it‚Äôs i dont know if it‚Äôs my tendency to play on low population servers in the games I play or me being anti social
---
Or by unequipping it / putting your weapon away (on PC by pressing/holding R key)
---
Welcome!
---
No problem, just wish I had better news. It‚Äôs ridiculously overpriced.
---
Shhhh its not a bug its a feature
---
A majority of my items are plans, common camp plans 3-5 camps uncommon 10 rare 25. Weapons and armor mod plans 5-10caps common, 15-25 uncommon and rare. For actual weapon or armor plan a fraction of the price depending on rarity and desire. Try to be cheaper then 25% of its suggested price. Fixer is only one I ask common yet fair price for. 
---
Magazines and bobble heads all 30 caps. 25 for chem recipes.
---
Legendaries I dont scrip are based of fed 76 but I don't ask for max. Usually closer to the minimum. I figured why suffer for my hording and ocd? Price it to be fair and sell fast. Usually only have trouble selling armor mods and really common weapon mods.
---
Yes. This.
---
Don't want to run around with level 20 gear at 50 do you? It's just an example of taking advantage of the platform. I figured people still craft weapons. Unless that's changed in the last week or so. Spam crafting for xp with the right perks/serums/chems/cranberrry whatever etc is faaaaast xp.
---
Everything ultracite except the shocks i sell for 1 cap.
---
So you have 2 stacking extremely lucky points of interest
---
1. You always find a Colossus at Fissure Site Prime (to this day I have only found, and had to solo, 3 of them)
---
2. The Firebase at the Server you log into Actually re spawns GHOULS, and not EYEBOTS
---
talk about some luck....
---
Yes, I figured I was being haunted.  Now I know I am not special.
---
Keep all level up bubblegums and you never have to look for the bloody things. They love to do challenges with those.
---
Because since everyone goes there to get them theyre never there
---
Behemot Vs Sentry Bot yesterday
---
You‚Äôre a little late to the party....
---
Haven't been keeping up with the latest news, have you?
---
I only sell the mounted heads that have 0 weight.  
---
I'm still not clear on how the game determines that some should weigh .25 pounds and some apparently don't take up space.
---
*Laughs in adventure mode*
---
That's a great CAMP but I gotta say:
---
The spooky immersion is ruined by the Doughnut vendor's song and dance...
---
Did you go there to see or just look at the map? I had heard from someone it also gives you that pop up if a player is standing where your base should be. Not sure if that‚Äôs supported by fact.
---
That's where the BoS will be based when they arrive in the coming update.
---
(‚òûÔæü„ÉÆÔæü)‚òû
---
Reselect the skin, it‚Äôll remove the checkbox, or should (PC)
---
It always has, I assume because scorchbeaste use the same mechanics as skyrim dragons.  I wouldn't be surprised if they did something that made it more frequent though
---
I am somewhere quiet. I'm nowhere near anything... But they have that issue where you must be at least 200+ feet away. Even though camps are only 50 feet wide.
---
‚ÄúTesting‚Äù
---
Same.  Have an upvote of solidarity
---
If this is accurate its horrible...
---
I think so, I was able to remove the skin without rebuilding, so I would assume you can apply the skin without rebuilding
---
I normally where my base is when I spawn in always grab ammo from the ammo machine before logging off. There was one far down the road one time but still no where near had others closer and spawned my camp no problems.
---
It's because they have a 200+ no build radius around camps, even though the camps are only 50 feet wide.
---
The no man's land area is too large. Especially for a game, where the main story is to REBUILD APPALACHIA.
---
It's 4k just for the suit. If you want the helmet, it's an extra 1650 ü§™
---
If you made good sells is because you had fine goods and fine prices. Congrats
---
No why would I
---
These are the same people who were whining about the ghillie suit requiring NW a few months ago
---
I don‚Äôt understand why my scrips and caps limit reset in the morning, the daily challenges at noon, and my daily factions around 5pm est
---
I've seen it in another player's CAMP working as I would expect it to, though - showing stars on nearby walls and the ceiling.
---
Oh, no way? I thought it was like 2400 suit and 1600 helmet. Man, that‚Äôs insane. Let me update that real quick, thanks.
---
Yea I felt the same way. My fix is(and I don‚Äôt know how often you play) to take a couple days, do the challenges and then just do what I want to do for the night. Not worrying about hitting west Tec and whitesprings yada yada. I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôve grinded enough of the run early on that I‚Äôm a good ways ahead so I know I can afford to take these days and it‚Äôs a nice refresher because grinding everyday definitely takes a toll.
---
I see months later this still hasnt been fixed.
---
Well you would know why atlas observatory is boarded up. New content coming.
---
Starting the event activates the three "pylons" (towers attached to a mobile generator). The Impostor Sheepsquatch boss will show up eventually, but invisible. As long as it is cloaked, it cannot be damaged at all. The boss attacks in typical Assaultron style, with the added bonus of its eye laser sets fire to the ground.
---
Once players have activated all three pylons the Boss will de-cloak, making it vulnerable. Each pylon a player is tethered to though will deal pretty heavy energy damage over time to that player. It IS entirely possible for a single person to tether all 3 pylons with the right gear/perks.
---
The whole time this is going on, swarms of bots will be attacking everyone in sight, gutsys, protectrons and eyebots. Try to keep distance from the eyebots as they are actually bombs that explode on death or when they catch up to someone.
---
Lmaoooo
---
That guy is lucky
---
Buying them or picking them up from other players doesn't count so for people that just buy bobbleheads it doesn't really bare relevance
---
Well it‚Äôs not my fault I have better things to do then look at fallout 76 news
---
anyone know what the equivalent on console is?
---
I've very recently started with NW and I'm finding it a lot more enjoyable than I expected. And yes I can't kill anyone. At all. Not even close. 
---
So it's the Bush life for me. I am astonished at how often enemies walk straight passed. It adds an odd excitement to the survival. Best placed so far in 6th.
---
Sadly, Rifles are the only weapon class that inexplicably have no weight-related Perk Card.  Even Pistols get one, and they aren't even that heavy to begin with.
---
So, your options are basically weight reduction armor or the 90% reduce weight perk on the Rifles themselves.
---
Oh yess, it's you who took the SBQ mid flight picture! Crazy good, makes me wonder if I am even playing the same game. Let me know if you need someone to hold pylons, I usually tank all 3 with my Troubleshooter's set and way too many Stimpak Super's lol. If you are on PC, that is
---
Isn‚Äôt +100 the excavator power armour? I was just reading about it.
---
Or by tapping the aim button again. It always works for me.

If you're still online I have a couple !

I got the Blue Ridge Caravan backpack plan for 350 caps from a vendor that clearly belonged to a pretty new player. They had so little other stuff for sale that even buying it all didn't really make up for it.
---
max lvl standard backpack from the tadpole missions is 60.. high cap mod for it is another 60
---
Let's do it!
---
Like going to reddit and asking something that's been common knowledge for nearly a month?
---
this "balancing" this is not how it should work.   
---
 i'm also very disappointed with the rocket launcher,   
---
even a shotgun can do more damage than a badass rocket launcher, wtf? "balancing"
---
the semi auto .308 receiver could at least be an alternative for the hardened handmade rifle receiver.
---
What plan?
---
at least they could warn us about losing chinese stealth suit after siding with raiders geeez, that item was literally free from 1¬∞quest and as raider u must hit the friendly reputation with settlers and buy it for 4K GOLD BULLIOn. This is just insane
---
Haha amazing, i love random experiences with strangers like this in the game
---
That rarely works for me :(
---
High capacity backpack mod gives an extra 60 carry weight to the original 60 on a max level backpack totalling 120 lbs.
---
i cannot remember ever seeing super mutants in lewisburg 
---
are you sure you're thinking of the right place?
---
Maybe start a new character as a different build
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

It is an option. It‚Äôs called staying on the server.

Oh my god that is so fun to do! Better than wingdings!
---
While I think that guy‚Äôs definitely over dramatic. I definitely have bashed my head against a wall trying to explain this game to my friends. While you‚Äôre 100% allowed to play the way you want to, some people just like to act like the game and community is against them when the reality is they just don‚Äôt understand simple mechanics. 
---
People need to learn others will play differently than them as well that you can‚Äôt expect to keep up with a bloody in the upcoming events if you aren‚Äôt willing to drop your 10 hunger reduction perk cards and start investing in your gear.
---
Yeah.. the wet look on everything even when its not raining looks really really bad
---
Also annoying when you are getting lit up by a bad guy who clearly has (for example) a Gatling Laser and then you kill him and he drops a shotgun and some shells.
---
I'll be playing tomorrow at 11AM GMT-1. Gamertag: delarro. I'd gladly help you
---
Hah I saw that one! But I‚Äôm on PC. Funny coincidence though
---
Yeah, I think for a lot of us, we just didn't care.  I focused on developing two other characters to take the load off the main one, instead of continuing to drive the main's level up.  When the Legendary Run suddenly made Intelligence important, it became necessary to invest in the various perks surrounding it, whether that's Night Person, joining a Building Team, dealing with Lunchboxes, doing XP farming, etc.
---
It took a very long time for my main to get from Lv. 300 to 400.  She's now zoomed past Lv. 440 in just a few weeks.
---
well then, u must be near some kind of resource spot and u arent aware of that, just move it somewhere on the rock for the best view and u wont have this problem ever again
---
Hey I'm on PS4, I'm not sure what pump actions I have but since I'm a shotgun build my self I should have some of them stored, tell me if this might interest you

I have other lvl400, lvl105 and lvl300 characters.

Th√¶≈Ñk√ü f√µr √ø√¥√∫r f√©√®dbƒÅƒçk.;

The gauss shotgun annoys me. My pump shotgun one shots almost everything, but my shotgun that I did a month long grind for take like 4 shots
---
This, you can also use this same character for the 'level up' challenge
---
I pretty sure i read some post about scorchbeasts following you being not a bug, gonna search for that,
---
Lol yea
---
Depends on how you play. For me, it made post lvl 100 really fun. I ran the same way as you until then and just found I wasn‚Äôt really doing a lot of dmg in events and I was constantly struggling to keep my rss balanced. Bloodied unarmed brought the combat back to how it was in FO4 for me and it‚Äôs made endgame a lot more exciting, especially fun when you‚Äôre helping a new player get lvl 60+ kills
---
Yeah. I've been meaning to remove him and replace him with the Halloween one. Just haven't gotten around to it. 
---
I wish it would malfunction and sound creepy  while playing it's tune. It'd fit in better.
---
It isn‚Äôt forced, it‚Äôs just the best way to travel so you‚Äôre forced to use it. No biggie.

Yeah i tried those out and came to the same conclusion that theyre kinda underwhelming. Theres a bunch of vats perks if you like those but my favorite are serendipity, ricochet, bloody mess, class freak, amd theres a couple others im not thinking of but i usually use class freak to get more intelligence.
---
The Legendary Run has confirmed 100 percent no one at Bethesda plays their own game. None of this would of happened if you played 15 minutes with the skins etc.
---
Are you laughing because you don't think it's rare or because i paid such a small amount? 
---
because if it's the former it is very rare. Cheapest i've seen one go for is 10k. Seen them go for 50k worth of trades as well.
---
I haven't been there is ages but i do remember that the place (used to atleast 100%) spawn either ghouls or super mutants. Did they change something? No idea..
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lewisburg](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lewisburg) (still described as possible spawn)
---
Its not possible to have a liberty prime event, its Canon that Liberty Prime isnt at all functional until the events of FO3, and that game is 150+ years after Vault 76 opens. Jet isnt even invented for 200 years after 76 opens.
---
Once again Bethesda making me collect everything whether I use it or not and never throw it away in fear of needing it.
---
SCORE challenge tomorrow - collect 3 orange bandanas, 4 ash trays and 2 skulls....
---
Jokes aside - still really enjoy this game still.
---
Dear god I want to cry at how long this request took me to find, but I did indeed after nearly 30-45 minutes find it.
---
[Here is your crib of abducted cows](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/601477315825762334/641790601016115201/unknown.png)
---
Very true!
---
In fact, I'd rather have say 1~3 lunch boxes than script!
---
I've never seen mutants in Lewisburg. It's always been ghouls for me. 
---
You sure you aren't thinking of Huntersville in the savage divide? That town is exclusively super mutants
---
Too deep....fill that hole a bit.
---
You staying as a high level player can help them breeze through a lot of the early missions that suck to do at low levels.
---
I was wondering about this.  Can you tell if a water purifier in someone else's camp is locked by looking at/ interacting with it?  I have yet to have one give me any water.  Not sure if I'm just unlucky, or barking up the wrong tree.
---
Ah well fuck... there goes that idea down the drain. Wish we had the ability to put our profile picture on painting and stick em up everywhere tho
---
This is true of all the CAMP Module skins.
---
Barbed walking cane. seen it go for 50K. Seen it go for 10k.
---
Ok thx,I'll add you
---
I sell them for really cheap like under 100 caps, unless they're low level and then i find people to give them too. If there's no stash space I drop them at events with lots of players.
---
Soot tea's gone cold I'm wondering why...
---
How do you get the high capacity mod? More tadpole badges?
---
So why did you buy from dupers? Thats the problem.  Cheating is wrong . Doesn't matter if its in a game ,in school ,sports ,on your spouse. Its wrong
---
Top ten most hated character of the full saga. Prove me wrong
---
Brahmin are the only resource
---
That would be awesome!
---
Instead of scrip, drop 1~3 lunch boxes.
---
I get this glitch too over here on ps4. They have plenty of things to fix on this game. The respawn bug, adrenaline, vats in pvp like honestly its chaotic
---
Lol never played as a bush Wookiee but I have won without hurting anyone before, spent the whole match looting n running around and in the end the SB killed the last person... Victory!?
---
Nice
---
Make a new toon and hide in a bush for ten min.  Done.
---
Once the BoS comes back to Appalachia it would be cool to have a mission where you have to raid a pre-war facility and gain the schematics for Liberty Prime.
---
You have to get like 8 possum badges or something I think. My friend gave me the plan. I'm sure u can find a high capacity backpack mod for like 10k at most. They were duped to heck and back
---
Yes, just change the receiver in the mid menu. You will need the plan if you want to mod it back to prime though.
---
It's not so bad once you know where a few different static spawns are for stuff like gum. I found 2 in Flatwoods and got the last one at the Pumpkin House, then stumbled upon another on the desk by the vendor bot at Top of the World. Most Red Rocket stations often have some too, not just the one in Flatwoods.
---
It would encourage more "coummunity"
---
Because I can‚Äôt get any good weapons myself. I have played over a year now and I don‚Äôt use any of the guns I have gotten my self
---
I LOVE that location! I remember still when I first found it, early in the game, and it freaked me right tf out! I was not okay for a minute! Excellent everything about it!
---
Yeah. Just go to a weapons workbenches and go go receivers. You should see any unlocked receivers you have there. Select any other one besides prime or prime automatic and boom!
---
Yeah, same. I get enough xp just doing the challenges, and I hit whitesprings twice a day, but not to kill ghouls, just to kill the sentry bots for the 1.4k xp each (3 to 6 of them each time makes for some easy xp).
---
With sneak attacks though? It doesn‚Äôt matter what I used bloody junkies they all stop at around 30 damage per shot (outside of sneaking) it doesn‚Äôt matter if it says 200 per shot or 70 damage we shot, it always does 30 or so damage when actually hitting the enemy.
---
Completing 3 Scout Tadpole missions get you a better backpack than the standard one  you get at Morgan Airport, and completing the Scout Possum missions afterwards will get you an upgrade to further its carry capacity (although the latter comes at the expense of radiation and energy resistance.).
---
Because it looks awesome
---
No finally fixed last patch
---
You ruined my prank üòí lol
---
Superficial is a hallmark of this game unfortunately.
---
That would be awesome
---
Ah thanks.
---
You absolutely can make your own fusion cores...
---
I don‚Äôt use Reddit for fallout news I just use it to read story‚Äôs from AMITA or entitled parents
---
If your nuke takes out everyone left, you magically survive and win. Not my favourite mechanic, but there it is. You ruined someones day. Well done! :p
---
I server hopped multiple times and ran up to the 4th floor of the asylum, knowing that one could spawn in the small room next to the pool table. After about 6 hops I run into the room and finally see one. "Fucking finally" I think to myself. I walk over and pick up the strength bobblehead. An image of the little flexing bastard spins on my screen while the text tells me crap I already know and I wait. No scrore bar? No score increase? Maybe it'll pop up once the animation finishes. No... nothing yet. What the hell? Maybe I have to USE the bobblehead. It wouldn't be the first time Bethesda left out information like that. I open my pipboy and open the aid tab. Where... where is it? What. The. Fuck. I picked that son of a bitch up and got the damned animation and everything and the not only did the game decide for it to not count for my score, but I don't even have the bobblehead in my inventory. Its like Bethesda was laughing at me. "Ha, you think your done? Guess again fucko. Shouldn't have canceled your 1st sub." To hell with the asylum. I travel to the lighthouse near vault 76 and after about a dozen server hops another bobblehead spawns in the third story window. This time I just look at it for a minute. I want the game to be as sure as I am that it exists this time. Yeah point your little gun at me you asshole, nobody uses small guns anyway. Your worth more to me at the train station vendor and that's where your going to end up. So after a minute I pick up the bobblehead and thankfully my score bar pops up and advances. On boy, more fireworks I'll never use. At least a I'm just a few spaces behind Zongo or Zultan or whoever he is. I can finally log off till noon tomorrow and do it all over again.
---
I was quick on the response lol, my bad :p
---
They removed alot of super mutant spawn locations. Most were replaced with floaters.
---
4k gold :/
---
Them prices are actually inhumane.
---
No worries lol
---
I almost go out of my way to punch or shoot any "live" vehicle I get near. Fireproof makes it do virtually no damage, and it just triggers some part of my brain that really enjoys watching the explosion.
---
If it gets stuck in 3rd person just go to 1st person and aim again should fix it. I cant stand the bug man. Just 1 more on Bethesdas huge list of bugs
---
Most duppers never got their mains banned the were using burner accounts from the start. After they were done dupping it went to another burner and they never even got back on those dupe accounts after the ban wave hit
---
The "problem dupers", you know ebay sellers, facebook black market trades, and online buyers. All played it smart dropped prices dupped crap like rabbits going at it. Made hundreds if not thousands in cash and then just lost a few burner accounts
---
I've rolled over 100 now and only gotten 1 bloodied, which was a 1\*
---
Exterminator's, Hunter's, &amp; Suppressor's make up over 60% of the garbage, and only 21% have been 3\*
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH. What post was this from?
---
Did you sniff the pipe by any chance?
---
It needs to be a top priority for sure. Everything else is annoying but manageable.
---
Hmm I‚Äôm running with a quad gauss atm and it definitely out preforms my BE25 combat shotty
---
That explains why the event keeps failing! We‚Äôre all killing ghools, but nobody is collecting ore.
---
Jeeze people are all being a bit condescending today...
---
Oooooof. Yep that‚Äôs fallout for you
---
It's the community you play with that makes the game a good game.
---
I was an unarmed..Lucky break 2 plus White Knight 3 i never had to worry about repairing.
---
They stealth nerfed all of that
---
Luck of the Draw works ok on my heavy weapons. To me only worth keeping if you have the spare room for the 2/3* card
---
Oh man, i wish the game looked this good on xbox
---
Yeah doesn't sound fun. I just use my fixer at SBQ and that's it. I don't even run silos anymore i just go to sbq when i see it. I rarely die there though, I'm pretty good at not letting anything get near me. Shoot and move and keep my distance from the other players who are attracting mobs. I'm just there for the flux though, IMO there's easier ways to farm xp.
---
Hmmm, idk what‚Äôs wrong but I‚Äôll definitely have to check it out
---
Ah how? I went to the tinker's bench and can only make plasma cores
---
As a side note, you ONLY get the plans for the helmet and stealth armor for free IF you choose the 8+ Intelligence option to have Penny Hornwright retrofit the design to removed the bio-tracker. Any other options result in needing to buy the plans for bullion.
---
This. It's a great gift but more than likely duped. I still learned all the duped plans that have been dropped to me, knowledge is power right?
---
The ability to craft any weapon or armor as legendary if you know the plans...and select the legendary perks. This should finally put an end to the RMT market.
---
If you look around closely you can find speakers that are emitting the screaming. When I first visited it I got scared because I was looking for some scrap and after I heard the scream and felt the ground shake, my internet went out. Bad storm so I said it's one hell of a perfect timing.
---
I have played from day 1 . I didnt have any good drops either. I made the guass minigun and the guass shotgun . The mini a 3* bloodied and the shotgun is a 3* vampire .
---
I found it in a Discord I use because it posts pictures of all Atom store and Season item's upcoming, I found it posted 11th of July 2019, so a full year's worth of items I had to scroll my way through to find.
---
If anyone is curious, I use Psycho Voltage's Discord for all Atom store leaks, Invite for everyone: https://discord.gg/2ng6XNV
---
Real night.  Like deep in the Mire night.
---
As far as I can tell, the weapon damage itself doesn't make any difference.  I think it's like Vampires, really - each hit contributes the same amount of healing.
---
Didnt stay long enough lol
---
Incorrect Cuase 3* are relatively harder plus the added rng to the drop getting a 3* from a 1* enemy removes the point of 3* so insted of Haveing x* enemy we should just call them legendary and depending on the type of enemy depends on the chance of a better * drop
---
Nah. 
---
Junkies hits like a freight train. Vampire heavies with FFR is damn near never die. Anti Armor does a hell of a job also. 
---
I use a Junkies .50 and LMG in power armor. I don't remember the last time I died or couldn't solo something short of the SBQ. I run zero damage reduction perks with maxed heavy gunner, stabilized, one gun army, bloody mess, and batteries included.
---
I always drop it back down, but the shovel is supposed to re-spawn each time the mission gets activated. if it's not next to the grave check behind the big tree that is in front of the graves.
---
I understand, it's a long lasting obsession. I used to sit and snipe cars from the top of Tenpenny Tower. 
---
Fireproof isn't a bad idea, I'll have to look into that. Maybe suggest it to the wife too. I underestimated the extent of the destruction a single bullet can cause in the parking lot of the Valley Galleria last night and sploded the shit out of her.
---
Take fireproof, problem solved
---
Dense chest mod and fireproof perks are your friend.
---
Lewisburg is one of the places I remember getting absolutely wrecked by super mutants as a low level player shortly after launch. I haven‚Äôt seen them there in a long time, however. It could‚Äôve been around the same time they made pleasant valley/top of the world easier?
---
I'm a former bush wookiee who has turned PA heavy build very recently. If I spot a wookiee, I leave them be. They are gentle creatures who need nurturing. Wookiee on, my friend.
---
I think your idea about it being the tools they use is probably right.
---
Ok that's fine. But you just got the news..... on reddit. Any way enjoy the game and new content when it comes out. And by the way, head up to the crashed space station. You'll be in for a surprise.
---
Yeah just sounds like Bethesda‚Äôs usual performance. Probably have to wait for a patch or reinstall it.
---
Right! ;)
---
You can craft one that goes in the display case. It's in the Tinkers bench.
---
Aww that's good
---
Yeah remember to charge it up too
---
Errr I have one GT : r0ckerfella. On now.
---
Oh he pays for my fallout 1st subscription so now that we are talking about it, I feel bad and maybe I should start doing his again ü•∫
---
Social distance please... hugs must   follow with two weeks quarantine.
---
why do people need bubblegum? i usually just biff it away.
---
Atleast in the past there used to spawn either lv\~20 or so ghouls or super mutants. Still described as possible spawns on wiki  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lewisburg](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lewisburg)
---
I think that‚Äôs my problem, I try to go fast instead of charged
---
I love explodey things
---
Well at least people won't pay $200 US for a legacy anymore. It did the most damage to the black market , however most of them played it safe and never even looked to see if their burners got banned while they sold 20 times the amount of guns for $10 a dupe.
---
The "Ultracite" Optimized Bracers are for "Ultracite" Power Armor.
---
You need "X-01" Optimized Bracers for X-01 Power Armor. Check with MODUS for those.
---
You are totally right! I will do that right now lol.i have a couple of turrets on top of mineral extractors and the generator, those are fine?
---
Being a fan of Pipe Revolvers, Pipe weapons never get much love in general be it in atom store skins. I was thinking why Bethesda doesn't just create a set of basic skins or designs (Tactical Black paintwork, worn and scratched metalwork, raiders/settlers faction paint etc) That'd be able to be permanently brought in the atomic store and would be a generalised item allowing any weapon to have it.
---
I know obviously it would take a large period of time to create a skin that'd be able to be applied to every single weapon in game, but once the work had been done it'd be done and hopefully they'd see a return on time spent because people like you and I would buy atoms to buy it.
---
How about just not assigning you to the SAME SERVER 5 times in a row when you decline it due to camp conflict?
---
ive made textures for fallout weapons with fried chicken as the texture. they need to get their shit together.
---
edit: im also an idiot with barely any computer skills. but if i can follow youtube tutorials and pull it off, why cant they?
---
I‚Äôm like level 20 right now
---
Good ideas. Going to look into the fireproof perk. As for the chest mod I just can't bring myself to give up my CSS.
---
Weapon weight reduction armor
---
but you dont get to see it, since you have to say "yes i want all my hard work destroyed" before being able to even turn around or fast travel.
---
They dont care about the PvP community.
---
my buddy got a bffr90 on his 2nd roll fucking ever, and he isnt even a heavy build. I was so damn mad.
---
As in jojo siwa?
---
CSS?
---
For the challenge. You sometimes get one that requires you to eat bubblegum.
---
Quality over quantity.
---
That's the one I'm talking about. When I craft it then try to transfer it to the beer stein case, it won't let me. I tried just placing it on the case and that doesn't work either.
---
I have a second toon but i don‚Äôt have a good way to transfer.  I did have fallout 1st for a month but I don‚Äôt play as much in the summer so I was waiting till fall to see if I would play a lot again and I would sub again
---
What? It doesn't get destroyed.. It used to, like a year ago.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a harder weapon to use. Also, do you play it in 1st or 3rd person?
---
Legendary bots for me. I could wait till after the explosion to loot them but sometimes it's just impossible to find them.
---
There is nothing more annoying than being in the middle of a firefight, frantically going into your Pip-Boy to scroll down and find your power armor, quickly place it, and then sit through this ridiculous slowpoke animation of putting the battery in.
---
Chinese Stealth Suit.
---
That will be me next week, when I take over my husband's account for the next year. SCORE grind x2.
---
Just you, I havent crashed in 3 days
---
I see. LOL
---
:'(
---
1st, why exactly?
---
Ikr it's pretty obvious. Nothing was wrong with survival and all the snowflake food builds cried and complained about it and got it removed. Now they complain about "griefers" in adventure mode. They did it to themselves.
---
I recently poured a bunch of excess ammo i dont use into my vendors for 0, and some level 26 bought all of it and im like "okay but that wasn't the point but fair i guess"
---
For all the time pkay?  So many better options
---
Believe it or not, it shoots much faster and vats is more accurate in 3rd person.
---
It was nice to ask him how he liked his cut. But yeah, had the choices I made in this game mattered, I probably would have gutted the leadership of the Settlers and put MODUS or the Overseer in charge of them.
---
Godspeed.
---
I did buy them from MODUS. It specifically said "Plan: Ultracite X-01 Optimized Bracers"
---
Edit: Just checked again and I had it backwards. It says "Plan: X-01 Ultracite Optimized Bracers"
---
Really??? Bethesda is a difficult company
---
Bethesda, please add this guy's chicken gun skin to the game.
---
Yeah, just done with that particular grind.
---
Don‚Äôt tell me how my normal play is. I horde everything.
---
Not for me there aren't.
---
Hahaha yeah man it‚Äôs weird. But try it out. If you‚Äôre used to playing in 1st person it takes a few days to get the Hang of 3rd, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it. I only play 3rd person now haha
---
Yep, always complaining about the 1 time.
---
These are not difficult things to do.
---
Not exactly. When I wear power armor with stabilized my heavy weapons do more damage and I almost can't be staggered out of shooting.
---
You are 100% incorrect on that.
---
Oh 100%. They did it to themselves. Goddamn fucking foodies.
---
I probably have 50 bubble gum on me I didn‚Äôt even notice till I did the challenge, every 5 levels you get one and you can find it out in the world too, it‚Äôs not exactly hard to find. Same goes for bobble heads there‚Äôs plenty of static spawns
---
I have a ton of bubble gum
---
Ok. More carry weight. Better protection. Added perks. Better ap regen.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3bgy1/psa_intelligence_increases_xp/
---
Stop being a dick
---
Oh yeah, absolutely. 
---
I got a little better about that when I learned to use the snapmatic to find bodies. Mostly when I die to splody robots it's because I forget they're going to explode.
---
Good luck bud. I received a bloodied on my third or fourth roll. I‚Äôm at nearly 100 rolls now for the Gauntlet, and the best I‚Äôve received is a J/SS/+1P. Someone posted their B/SS/+1S roll earlier today. It hurt my soul.
---
I farm foodies for their junk and go to game chat just to listen to their rage. Its fukin hilarious. Like put pacifist on you little trashboat and stop crying. If pacifist is off then you're game for pvp. It take 2 parties to start. They have to shoot back in order to start pvp.
---
I haven't got a 3* in a while. I've killed well over at least 50 3* enemies in the last 2 weeks of playing or so and I dont even get a 3* drop, I think I may have got 1 or 2 the entire time, but they were absolutely horrible, like troubleshooters +1s sweet spot robot limbs and just dog shit rolls like that
---
I drew that conclusion because a guy literally responded to this post saying that I was likely in their server....
---
Haha
---
Have an upvote. This is an incredibly stupid challenge and very niche. Is it so hard to just make challenges 'Complete 'X' Event' or along those lines that reflect regular gameplay?
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Best selling is 5.56 by far. 
---
I make the following  5.56 .45, .308, .50 in that order 
---
I also sell the following that I pick up
---
Fuel
---
Cryo Cells
---
Shotgun ( moves slow so I keep around 200 - 300
---
Plasma cartridges
---
Fusion Cores when I have 100% ones 
---
If I didn‚Äôt use 5mm I would also sell that but I make it for my self when I‚Äôm low. (Best bag for your material I think).
---
Oh damn yeah. For some reason the game never gives us what we want, but rather the opposite lol. I‚Äôve gotten a few junkies shotguns that isn‚Äôt bad at all. Buuuuuut I‚Äôm not junkies haha. But yeah we will eventually get it hopefully :)
---
Do you just want them to give you score points next season?
---
The line of cars at Whitesprings is the best..
---
I did not say to buy them or pick them up from other players..
---
Tbf OP is like "urrr no why would i look up the reason" instead of making a post theyll probably delete
---
Ok. 
---
I have a 1st tent, carry weight means nothing. 
---
I'm an invisible asshole with only silent and melee weapons, taking damage isn't a thing so protection is meaningless. Well, except the aforementioned exploding cars. 
---
I have gun-fu and Grimm Reaper's Sprint, AP isn't an issue. 
---
Again, other armor doesn't offer anything for me.
---
Man, the point is to fall behind and buy score with atoms. They are not good-hearted people willing to reward you for playing their game.
---
Many of them duped on their mains because they got complacent. They didn't get banned the first 8 times, so why bother with all the hassle of alternate accounts and muling stuff around?
---
On the scale at the tea museum is another spawn spot that is close to flatwoods.
---
chemistry bench!
---
Ok. Enjoy
---
Oh yeah, that and the Valley Galleria parking lot I blew my wife up in yesterday.
---
Same with PreWar food challenge
---
do Monster Mash once and youll never have to worry about that one again
---
Exactly. Ran into that problem today
---
Ah ok makes sense, thanks mate
---
They should also remove the enemy indicator, that red little arrow that appears on any enemy that shoots a gun near you. The wall of fire takes care of the pace of the game already, there's no need to hold our hands and have a big arrow pointing to where the shots are coming from. And, while they're at it, remove the crosshair turning red when hovering over an enemy, so people can't just scan through the bushes to find enemies.
---
Do other battle royale games have these kinds of indicators?
---
Oh I absolutely do.
---
&gt; Completing 3 Scout Tadpole missions get you a better backpack than the standard one you get at Morgan Airport
---
the one in the airport is the Small Backpack.. the one from the tadpole missions is the Standard Backpack
---
So not any different from the usual then.
---
Displayed Items shoukd have a seperate stash space.
---
&gt; This would work really well with solo queue only matches.
---
A true solo mode *is* what the game absolutely needs - a mode where *everyone* queues up solo, and where there are no groups whatsoever.
---
What do we need to do to make this happen, though? Clearly it's not being requested enough for Bethesda to notice.
---
It ruins the game for people who actually care about it. It needlessly extends matches and makes the whole experience far more boring. There's no excitement waiting 10 minutes to find a match and get through it just to shoot somebody standing still in the bushes. Nobody plays the mode just so they can shoot AFKs. The kill reward is pathetic, I think 15 exp for a kill, hardly worth the boring gameplay of not having real players
---
I used the bobblehead finder perk last year when I was trying to fill out the display case. You have no idea how many bobbleheads you pass without realising it. Gum you get every 5 levels, or from robot vendors, and there's several static or semi-static spawns of them around the world.
---
the standard pack from tadpole, and then buy a high cap mod on here. most people use the grocers though because it reduces food weight. personally I use armor plated for a little extra resistance until I get my SS armor yo the rolls i want
---
Sounds like spin to me...
---
[excellent!](https://i.imgur.com/WQ7pqTN.gif)
---
Most of them are. I think especially since they had to come up with 2 or 3 extra easy challenges. Not everyone plays the same, so inevitably the challenges don't reflect regular gameplay for someone. Example: I hardly ever claim workshops, but that is almost every day, now.
---
Seriously...theres posts everyday "I didnt get SBQ loot"  Well i did and here you go...ultracite jetpacks/prime receivers for everyone
---
I see EVENTS teams 3 x 4 stacks not running events
---
me and my build team just wonder...what are you all doing? Maximize your playtime and stop complaining because you havent figured it out
---
I'm just fed up with queen fights after i got a nocturnal rolling pin... 1 *
---
For me the weight is very important when I calculate the value of a item. If something is lightweighted I increase the price since I'm not in a hurry to sell it. Sooner or later someone will pay the price. If something weights around 20 I decrease the price because I need to free stash space
---
From your previous posts u play bloodied and die a lot.
---
Do you normally take a long time to log in? I‚Äôve wondered if the just takes so long to kid that some one had my spot and left within the amount of time it takes to spawn. Still not as bad as GTA‚Äôs Los screens I guessüòÇ
---
Do not engage in combat also aid by the way
---
It mostly same stuff that has been sitting for months. It might be cheaper now that I moved my camp and had to re-add everything to the vending machines.  I put the last of my plans in my machine today.
---
I also have been dropping all my plans from workshops to lvl 20 and below if they are in my public team or happen to see them at my camp to help make space.
---
The Morgantown high school has reliable gum spawns. It‚Äôs the Bobbleheads that I can never find. I must have hopped to 10 different bobblehead locations and found nothing
---
I have been lied to and my testing was incorrect. Thank you for correcting me with facts instead of the ‚Äòyou‚Äôre wrong and stupid‚Äô I get a lot
---
Im sorry. I just didn't like the way it was implied that I have nothing better to do than watch out for the latest fallout news. I have a lot of better stuff to be doing. Im a big fallout fan and in my spare time I like to play fo76 and keep up with the latest news.
---
I‚Äôm willing to bet if they made it where 3 star enemy drops a guaranteed a3 star legendary item, it would be really rare to see them.
---
[bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) should have all the contact information you need
---
yes. I've seen this for as long as I remember playing the game.
---
*just Bethesda things*
---
It just works!
---
THANK YOU

Drop a nuke in White spring and kill glowing enemies

The Settler Reputation is not bad when you accidentally loot Ward's quest item while not on the Settler Daily Quest and it is permanently stuck in your inventory.  Just talk to Ward and Settler Daily Quest is instantly done. 
---
The Gauss Minigun is very expensive to use since Ammosmith only gives about 25 EC for 5 Lead and 15 Steel.  Ultracite EC gives over 100 EC with Ammosmith, but that also requires Crimson Flux and Ultracite.
---
In honor of our host Daddy Bezos, I always sell my hoarded gum on days like today at ... market value
---
I get ya, it‚Äôs just the fact that this whole subreddit is full of people just being dicks for no reason. You aren‚Äôt one of them tho
---
Took me exactly 0 seconds to notice it. They either didn't look or didn't care.
---
that‚Äôs dumb. it‚Äôs still a combat rifle.
---
Thanks, I tried but I keep getting put on hold. Today I was on hold for about 3 hours until I hang up.
---
yes. The jumbo Mr. Fuzzy is the most useless do nothing waste of grinding time item in the game.
---
I found it more cost effective to rank up Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan for the increased durability when repairing.
---
yeah, it really has
---
After farming nuked mobs, look around for ultracite veins. Mine them, and each time a few new scorched mobs will spawn. If you‚Äôre really lucky you‚Äôll find a glitched vein that can be mined (without giving more than the 1st ore) continuously, thereby spawning constant scorched. Only been around for two months though, so maybe one of the veterans have better advice. Good luck with the hunt mate!
---
No, but it'd make sense
---
A couple level 100+ can fail if not coordinating. I'd definitely bring a team, and make sure you have 3 people willing to take a pilon apeace
---
Hate when they explode because I‚Äôve lost so many 3* legendaries even using the camera to find them hasn‚Äôt helped! Latest was was with sheepsquatch imposter üòî
---
Yeah that was a thought I had, does it work? I've only ever launched 1 nuke, and that on the fissure site prime.
---
You are the true hero of the wastes.
---
Check medical kits and the first aid kits on the walls. Something that might not be immediately obvious is that bathrooms are a good source for these kits. There's a perk in the Luck tree called Pharma Farma which gives you a pretty good chance (40% at rank one) of finding extra chems/stims in those containers.
---
That being said, it definitely sounds like you're in the wrong place. You shouldn't be running into anything at Level 50 in the Forest where you exit the vault at. The world is broken up into zones where enemies will spawn at different levels. Check out [this map](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vkwc2/fallout76_zone_map_with_level_ranges/) to get an idea of where on the map you should be.
---
Did you really go snooping through my shit so you could come back and try to prove some silly point that doesn't matter in the slightest? Here I thought you were mature enough to accept someone playing different than you when you said "Ok. Enjoy."  Instead you bust out the lamest possible, petty ass Facebook comment section 101 nonsense. 
---
Yes I play bloodied and yes, if I'm using big, loud guns I am more likely to be seen and then killed. Bloodied is a squishy build. You know what dying costs me? Absofriggenlutely nothing. Other than a handful of garbage there is no penalty to dying. So, yet again, it means nothing to me.
---
not everything needs to have a jojo reference
---
The game follows all the rules of a phone mobile game while asking for AAA pricing.
---
So its standard for high tier legendaries to drop better loot you say. So why have i only ever gotten 3 things from the queen that where higher than a 1* from hundreds of queen fights and encrypted runs.
---
dailies auto completing I think is the worst, made me quit the game.
---
The pharma-finda perk under the Luck SPECIAL will drastically increase your stocks of both type of healing shanks, as well as free purified water, disease cures, and antibiotics. I have so many sti.packs that I started sellibg them in my CAMP vendor on the cheap
---
I haven‚Äôt had the respawn glitch happen since it was ‚Äúfixed‚Äù but the fast travel bug has only gotten worse. I fast travel everywhere I can‚Äôt run to in 30 seconds but continually failing to fast travel after 20+ attempts is throw your controller through the tv frustrating.
---
So that's a full health build? If so, that sounds great, not sure if my friend would like having to frequently manage his rad levels. Could I see your full build?
---
Have a bunch of .38 available for free, couldn't understand why a minor invasion of players "bought" several rounds, one at a time. Was it some kind of code-language I wasn't in on? :D
---
Understandable, but a step back on specificity would help. 'Consume a cooked meal', 'Drink a beverage' would all be fairly easy and within regular gameplay.
---
If someone reads  this idea from team please take your time and Read mine to
---
Hand out    **permanent bans** to every  god mod, aimbotting, glitching cheater in Nuclear Winter.It's A batteroyale mod so its must have top notch anticheat otherwise watch a well thouht game mode become useless.
---
Isn‚Äôt that the point of question posts? So they understand what it means to the player base?
---
I‚Äôm kinda new at fallout 76, level 23 and scared of the god damn bears. I can‚Äôt imagine this monstrosity. Great picture!!!
---
yea this is a terrible AAA company. This game might be the end of them they keep up with this broken shit.
---
Word. Glad to know, and I had the same idea about wanting to not pvp people 100 levels higher haha. Thankfully those markers showed up, but it took a min. 
---
Idk why but I probably ran after a diff mob last time but I got a error I was leaving the event.
---
I‚Äôll try a different one later, just didn‚Äôt think that one was worth it with how they spawned, and wasn‚Äôt sure if the next defense would be better monsters. Glad they rotate.
---
And that‚Äôs my favorite event so far. Been scrapping the legendaries I do like for scripts and probably one of my favorite specs of the game haha.
---
the daily auto completion made me rage quit this game last night. Enough with this broken shit,
---
Google ‚Äúfallout 76 level map‚Äù that should help give you an idea of where you will/won‚Äôt die
---
There is so little to this game the frustration is all that is left when you see someone content creating their own fun not tied to the dailies or score.
---
I think it's just purely ghouls there since wastelanders.
---
Not only that...it should only take up either a) the build budget or b) the stash budget but NOT f‚Äôing both! That shit pisses me off.
---
White spring is better to farm high radiation fluid because there are more glowing enemies
---
why should we expect the mechanic is the game to work like they should.. Never seen a AAA title with this much broken stuff to the core game play.
---
Tbh your fine. Level 88 is all you need to grind too. After than with the atoms the run gives you, you can buy the other 12 levels. Its even set up to where you can skip i think 12 days and you'll still make it to 100 of you do all the weekly and daily challenges. I just hit level 61 last night and from what I've gathered on reddit 50 to 60is the norm rn.
---
 You don't need lock and load because speed demon will make reloading fast enough already.
---
 Get rid of good doggy, and get either the herbivore or carnivore mutation.  
---
Stabilized is essential with a power armor heavy build. Get rid of power patcher and gunsmith. I use a Vampire Gatling Laser as a low health build using nerd rage and adrenal reaction, along with Lifegiver. You basically can't die. Instead of power patcher and gunsmith I'd grab power user, cause you can double your energy ammo for that weapon if you go that route. I also use batteries included to reduce fusion core weight, which is a must if you wear power armor and also use them for ammo.   
---
Adrenaline is broken right now, so get action boy instead. 
---
Serendipity doesn't work with power armor, so either switch it for ricochet or put it in another special. And get rid of mystery meat.
---
These are so awesome
---
Also get rid of lootable death loot and replace it with something else punishing.
---
The antique shop in Cranberry Bog has one or two.  One upstairs at the corner of the bed kid of under the bed.  The other is right next to the weather vane.
---
Correct answer
---
Sometimes yea...but theres tons of posts all the time about simple parts of how the game works that you can just do a google search
---
and OP came off as an ass "Nah why would i look my question up"
---
FAQs exist for a reason
---
TBH it seems like the whole battle royale trend is dying out and isn't the money pinata it was 2 years ago, which means Beth isn't going to care about improving NW.
---
I think for them to listen to us, NW needs to become more popular for Beth to have a reason to improve it.
---
Also, to save you from wasting anymore of my time; I spend 90% of my play time crouching around, sneaking up on enemies and taking them out before they know where I am. I did it in Oblivion, I did it in Skyrim, I did it in fallout 3, NV, 4 and I do it in 76. You are not going to convince me that there is a better build FOR ME and the way I chose to play. 
---
You do you the way you do and I'll do ke the way I do and there is no reason for us to speak about it again.
---
It‚Äôs super easy just go to the fairgrounds and there are always a few bubblegums inside the building with all the pumpkins, in a basket on the table
---
This event definitely needs to have everyone who participated receive rewards from the ISS I def-rad hide till start and then grab pylons but by time I see where the sheep is he dead.
---
Could make a public team and ask people to help you with the quest. Also it depends on the region, Forest and Toxic Valley (more or less) are pretty easy locations with lower chance to come across difficult enemies, ash heap is 50/50. the closer you are to savage divide (the mountains chain) and beyond the tougher the enemies are. Whitespring is full of high level ghouls and some legendary enemies, so be careful. You could try your luck and hop from camp to camp. Some people sell stimpacks really cheap.If you have blood packs you can ask someone to craft you stimpacks. But better indeed not engage an enemy that has much higher level than you if you're alone. If you were on pc I would help you.
---
Thats a fucking joke.  All my 3 stars come from the purveyor lol.  Does he drop anything unique?  Plans or outfits?
---
Wow. Ok. Just trying to help u out a little. Jeez. Not changing your build. Never suggested it lol. Get a grip. And blocked so I won‚Äôt waste anymore of your time.
---
Check out Angry Turtle's you tube. He has several full health builds including this Tank healer one: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh2qduKezasfLpzgYQgQ7fk5VyJkLDyIZ 
---
Edited: Several builds include Adrenaline, which is currently broken, you can swap with other perks instead.
---
i think the copper makes more sense being ore but it needs to stack higher.
---
Gold, silver and crystal are not staple building materials they need to be vendored hence why meaning there scrap is better.
---
I like this event, I don't know why a lot of people avoid it. It's challenging alright, but sure that's part of the fun.  Lots of xp to be earned and quite a few legendaries.
---
No common plans ever hit my vendors. I love plans but nothing worse then vendor hoping and finding the usual suspects mounted heads and ultracite fodder.
---
I'm going to get that perk, thanks for the tip!
---
From that map I can already see my issue, I've been running into the savage divide quite a lot...lol ffs
---
Smartest thing you've said all day.
---
OP: Calls people out for being food builds.
---
OP: Also complains they can‚Äôt use VATs in PVP. 
---
LOL
---
I usually don‚Äôt use stims that much bc food and purified water are very good subs for it imo. I always stack on water just incase. In the long run it ended up providing me with over 100 stims that I only use when I‚Äôm literally a millimeter away from death.
---
Wish you were on XBox.

This is my main, he's a Junkies heavy stealth commando. I use .50's, LMG's, Fixers, and Handmades.
---
I hear ya, but judging from the salty responses here we're entitled for voicing an opinion that seeing all that stuff over and over sucks. Nothing is quite as much of a let down as a camp with 800 plans and they're all heads inside a single vendor.
---
I was, moved to PC, I got to abt lvl 90 and I had some spare guns if you wanted
---
Wait whaaaat I did not know it was rare haha I thought you were joking. I feel dumb not keeping mine. I swear I came across a few when I was a lower level and just dropped it.
---
Lewisburg is all Ghouls now....my camp is just south of the town (and has been for over a year)...I loved being able to run in &amp; get all that juicy SM experience....now, not so much.
---
I dump all ultracite plans, they don‚Äôt sell and presume most people have them.
---
FO76 is trash and the devs are really fucking bad at patching shit in a timely matter.
---
Anyway, try this:
---
[Click the three dots next to play](https://imgur.com/w5dMNU8) and hit *open mods folder*.
---
Find the file called Project76.ini
---
Go to Documents\My Games\Fallout 76 and copy and paste Project76.ini into that folder.
---
I have to do this every single time I start the game but unfortunately the game also crashes 5-15 minutes in every single time and forces me to go through the character creator every time because nothing saves.
---
I'm fine with shotguns having range but the Gauss is really overpowered in Nuclear Winter compared to other weapons. It 1-shots if you perk it out. You don't even need direct impact, you just shoot their feet and they're dead. The first time I used it I got a 24 kill game and it took pretty much no effort. It was just squad wipe after squad wipe.
---
Bethesda needs to fix their game and if you got a problem with it then go somewhere else foodie. You're not wanted here.
---
Holy cow! I sell them to the robovendor everyday, to get those last few caps. 20 or so is all I need, have never run out. Then again I rarely lockpick, so you do you.
---
Fine I get that. They're here, now they're over there. I did the goofy chase music thing ONCE. Find one spot where come up and wait until they come back.
---
Bloodied 10mil submachine guns gotta eat something.
---
In your last post you complained about the economy and duped items. Yet I guarantee you have a few duped items. You're the problem here.
---
I'm new so sorry for being dumb. I have the nuka fridge. But I cannot put nuka cola in it. Am I doing something wrong? I'm asking you as you seem to be invested in collecting nuka cola as am I.
---
It's supposed to get you to play more aspects of the game. And how the fuck do you not have gum?! You get a stick every 5 levels + from score.
---
Damn, if only you made this post a few hours ago me and a friend of mine would gladly help.
---
This happens all the time and its hilarious
---
I'm good. Feel free to give them to some nice low levels, I've got about 2000 hours in-game, I'm set.
---
We would game more players if rng wouldnt suck so bad in this game
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what I said at all... I said they have a **chance** to drop better (higher star) loot. 1 Star enemies, cannot drop that great loot at all because they are limited to 1 Star. Again... is RNG and clearly you have bad luck. I got a 3 star junkies explosive combat rifle off the queen. It‚Äôs all RNG.
---
Why, I can do it now if you want, or tmrw maybe?
---
When you're level 300+, leveling up 15 times to get 3 pieces of gum for a DAILY is a headache.
---
I thought what animation played was random Ive had people shooting me in the face while I just casually step into my suit....
---
Epic
---
Same here. Mostly it's just the NW challenges. My wife will get on and run adventure mode for hours but isn't a big NW fan so I'll load her in and bush wookie her while I'm doing stuff in adventure mode that doesn't require immediate and constant attention. CSS helps with that.
---
because we're both offline and I'm already in bed, checking Reddit before sleep haha. If you don't find any mates I could help tomorrow.
---
I usually don't waste space on things I'd price at 1 cap, but I may start doing Halloween candy considering how bad that event is now that it's just charred ghouls and probably want it to go to something better than whatever the smart machine gives.
---
Though I do have plans priced under 20 caps most of the time. Mole miner gauntlets and mr handy saws always go for 1 cap too.
---
Aight, but we‚Äôre in a massively different timezone (EST myself), tell me what time and timezone is good for you
---
During Fasnacht, I had gotten a brand new gun from the event, and I fell in love as soon as I got it.  I‚Äôve wanted a good 10mm pistol, but I never really wanted to go out of my way to get one. This was the one for my playstyle, it was an AAE.  Well anywho, I was pulling an all nighter to grind Fasnacht, and I was dropping useless stuff.  Suddenly server lags and I drop the 10mm on accident. I got in the bag immediately, but it blue screened.  I come back, and all the useless shit is in the bag.  10mm is gone and some level 500 was walking away from the bag.  I pm him and explained the situation, but he just said he didn‚Äôt take it. Any way you cut it, I lost the gun.
---
I have a lot of Stimpacks I need to unload, wouldn‚Äôt mind giving you a couple hundred on Xbox.
---
Or they could get rid of the legendary enemies and just make all kills have a chance to drop 1-3star items. I‚Äôd kill everything in site at all times if they did this
---
its funny how they release seasons like this big thing, while they main way to get score is bugged. I'm honestly done wasting time on this game anymore.
---
Ha, been there. Glad to help!
---
Because it‚Äôs Bethesda.
---
If you are on PS4 I can sell you a high capacity plan for caps or interesting trades.
---
Ahhhh the responders is the rare one
---
I have a free vendor in my camp where I put all known recipes and camp plans I find. Every once in a while someone comes and 'buys' everything in the vendor. It's kinda crappy when I see it's a level 200 who obviously knows all those plans and recipes, but when it's a new player it feels great. I wonder if they count towards that challenge. ??
---
Just perfect. The one item in the Legendary Run that fits my theme has a major bug. Why wouldn't it? Thanks for the warning.
---
Ahhh! I tried Rad Rumble for the first time yesterday but left because some guy was killing all the npcs before it even started. I thought he was griefing.
---
The Downvote Clowns, a semi-radical offshoot of the Insane Clown Posse. Very busy on this sub...
---
I've always thought it would be fun to have an extra option in the settings menu to see your teammates loading screens mixed in with yours. Obviously there would be trolls but that's the whole point of having the option available.
---
There's the added bonus that Beth can't take it's 10% tax when the item is 1 cap. I think I'll go buy 10k ammo one piece at a time. üòÇ
---
Why do the daily challenges have amounts that change? The bubblegum challenge sometimes only requires you to use one. Several other challenges are the same way.
---
If they bought three rounds for zero caps, it didn‚Äôt trigger. 
---
All my 38 ammo gets priced at zero so any new players coming by my CAMP (near vault 76,) have a chance to grab some ammo. 
---
Too bad we can‚Äôt do vendor bundles. Like 100 rounds of 38 for 5 caps or something.
---
Bold of you to assume they have a right hand and not just two left hands with the state of things atm.
---
Big difference is colossal problem is introducing a new legendary effect. Drop rates probably suck but depending on BGS uses it could be the next god tier gear
---
What kinda end game would you like do you know most mmo'dont really have any end game
---
I'm not sure, but it may only be magazines that you pick up in the world, rather than bought ones
---
i jump and open map while in air makes  fast travel works 98 % of time-lol 1st time
---
Smh I feel that was fighting a 3* sheepsquatch and was about to finish him off and he vanished ughhhh
---
Gonna have to try that then, however NW magazines don't count then
---
I literally just got murdered by a fellow Bush wookie.
---
Seneca Rocks next to the ‚Äúmonster‚Äù.
---
Who sells it? Money doesn't mean shit anymore I just can't seem to find any.
---
The easy option there would be to start another character.
---
I learned it when my friend got one, I'll have to finish one of my other characters it grind for it
---
Move camps. Pre existing camp stuff will be put into blueprints. Then breakdown blueprints which will get rid of it
---
I would guess not, since it wasnt in the base game and achievements weren't added with the game mode
---
Yup buying them doesnt count for obvious reasons
---
Gotta find them on your own
---
Also the building beside Tyler County Fairgrounds (with the Halloween party decorations inside) has a spawn point.
---
Such bs
---
So many modders creating great textures yet Bethesda's B team doesn't either care or try.
---
Well then
---
I made multiple characters and got them to level 50 just so I can scrip my endless legendaries. 150 per day is nowhere near enough
---
I can buy them from you, I've got like 3k bottlecaps?
---
Damn tht sucks, 
---
I "killed" the bear and counted towards the 10/10 legendary kills. Gave me the 1000 score
---
I "invest" in 1 cap ammo. Typically 5.56, plasma cartridges and .45.
---
Really I'm just stashing caps since I sell them 1:1.
---
check pay to fast travel system remove it , better fast travel works ,without bug
---
And waste my time playing a character I have no interest in? This game is not at all rewarding toward alts with no ability to transfer between characters.
---
I‚Äôve done the forbidden knowledge and got all the others. Just saw here initiate still drops. Only one I need. What event did you do or your friend
---
If not to help players who need it most what was the point? Surely a low level player is struggling with ammo supplies.
---
Huh, that's one I haven't heard before. Definitely works ok for me.
---
Yes! I really felt this post, yesterday went up against a 3* blood eagle and he had an op gatling and I loot him only to get a 1* pipe and a 10mm pistol...
---
You won't be banned for it.
---
There has never been a ban, to my knowledge, for minor glitches.
---
Only for duping, and they can't even do that right.
---
Enjoy your free ammo.
---
Someone before showed an Email that they had their level reset to 0 which is also a good middle finger when releasing them back.
---
how did they put one in your camp?
---
It's not an bug like a lot of people says, they just had this feature since SB can spawn as legendary enemy to prevent missing loot if the body is out of map or in a breach and can't be reach.
---
Well i was hoping to help a few people with the purchase challenge xD
---
But i was like "thats fair" cuz he was low level and needed it
---
Rich people problems I‚Äôm too poor to care about.My broke ass feels rich with 1500 Caps in the pocket with my normal balance around 700 Caps.
---
Ain‚Äôt got time to be rich.
---
Yeah I think thats the key point.
---
I only can get 1-2 hours most days. With challenges like 3 legendaries. That can take an hour I I'm unlucky with spawns. 
---
But there is also the other daily Bullshit to do too. 
---
Like for me I'm not on top of my treasury notes. So I tend to still do the 3 wastelanders dailies each day. They are super tedious and with all the fast travelling and loading they can easily take 30-45 mins. 
---
Then waiting for events and doing events (if im lucky free range will pop up or project paradise. Uranium fever, one violent night are pointless in piblic servers) to get more notes.
---
I'malso trying to keep up with all xp boosting stuff to make sure I level up once a day and keeping my ammo stocked up, scrap not getting low etc.
---
So yeah, it's not as straightforward as it seems. There is alot else to do in this game without adding more tedium. Not everyone has hours upon hours everyday.
---
Oh well thats good you got the points at least mate.
---
But this isn't a traditional Fallout game and you shouldn't think of it as such. This is an MMO set in the Fallout universe and using the same engine and assets. As such, the core mechanics behind certain things are made following different rules. 
---
Take currency for example. You may think that there are only two real currencies in the game - caps and atoms, but have you noticed that every time new features are added, they are "paywalled" behind a new currency? Scout badges, Scrip, Mr Fuzzy Tokens, Gold Bullion, and when the legendary perk system drops, Perk points too. This is by design - and is a standard practice in the development of MMOs. You may find that logging in daily for faction rep and the score system is tedious, but that's not a bug - that's a feature. That's how the game was meant to be played. Otherwise, people would just power through all of the content in a week and then be done with it - which means fewer atomic shop purchases and the game shutting down prematurely, not to mention how much we would gripe about it too (Think of the backlash to Resident Evil 3 - a AAA gaming experience that was so short that it was almost universally panned, no matter how good the short amount of content that was available actually was).
---
The resemblance between Fo76 and Fo4 is really just skin deep, and comparing it to Fallout 4 does a disservice to both games because under the surface they couldn't be more different.  
---
If you're interested, I \*highly\* recommend Extra Credits on Youtube. They have a whole series on game design and their videos on MMO economies, Microtransactions, and the cost of video game development, really caused me to reevaluate how I understand certain core mechanics of this game.
---
That shouldn't be taken to mean that I don't want new content or that I wouldn't love some new side quests, but rather you have to come to terms with the fact that that isn't how MMOs really work. Any new content that is coming to the game is content that is designed to get people to log on every day. The upcoming Meat Week is a great example of this - people are going to want things like that Chally Stein for example. Boosting daily logins is how the game stays alive - adding another side quest in the mold of the Mistress of Mystery doesn't do that. 
---
Lastly there is an opportunity cost involved - new storylines, side quests etc require the creatives to plan out these stories and flesh them out. If I understand anything about Bethesda's game cycle - chances are these creatives are working on a year-long removed schedule. So for example, the main story beats, major quests and key side quests for Fractured Steel were probably being thought up and scripted out last Fall if not earlier, before being handed off to the assets team, the coding team, and to various voice actors to record dialogue. My guess is that if it seems that there is a "content" drought at the moment, it's probably because work has begun for their 2021 content (probably in May or so). So to your point - as I said, there's an opportunity cost involved. Any work these creatives put into minor quests today, is time and effort they are not putting into major quests tomorrow. And between Starfield and TES VI, I doubt Bethesda can move staff over to work on a game that's been out for 2 years already.
---
I understand that it sucks - but such is the reality of game development in 2020.
---
Well if the plan is in your inventory you can't craft them because you haven't learned it yet. Also can you screen shot that please? That plan isn't right at all.
---
I don't understand why other people cheating affects you at all, let alone negating your hard work. Unless they use their cheats to one-shot enemies, depriving you of XP and loot.
---
Sure, I can do 5 caps each. I‚Äôll send you my GT.
---
They reset 20hours from the time you scrap your first peice or sell your first item.
---
Mate 
---
ohh fancy you English friend ?
---
ammo is how most people do it, .45 or .556 is the most universally used, and is 1 cap a piece usually, but real investments are normally flux, and ultracite 45 and 556, ult 45 is a real hot currency lately and I'd buy as much as I can if I were you
---
The question flair shows I was asking people a question instead I got comments being assholes
---
I see, wish it would all reset at the same time
---
I was just thinking about that the other day. I guess they never said that‚Äôs how it worked, but they definitely showed one of the better map locations like white springs and then showed a DC lvl of destruction with an irradiated Charleston‚Äôs. Nuke zones are still cool, but I would‚Äôve loved an actual glowing sea vs rad storm prime
---
I don t understand why there are no favourite items closed
---
I have a lot of alts and transfer stuff all the time but suit yourself.
---
There's also 2 bubblegum spawns in Morgantown High under a table near the entrance with the overseer's logs.
---
This is how I did it few times. In nuke zone, find ultracite vein, and every time you click on it, it spawns a wave of scorched. Those have chance to drop HRFs. Rinse/repeat.
---
They invited me to a team and I joined
---
Found a tech data from someplace and got it when he turned it into forbidden knowledge
---
Take the Pharma Farma perks in LCK early. You'll eventually reach the point where you constantly have chems to sell.
---
I quadruple second this. Fallouts build limit is far too restrictive considering what Bethesda has done in other games, and as a game that pushes home cosmetics so hard, it is really surprising even Fallout1 players  have to deal with these limitations.
---
Ah
---
Oh. Yeah I get that. It seems like people here said free items don't count towards the challenge. That's weird. Like 1 cap is practically zero caps and the game notifies you when you 'sell' items for free, so it doesn't make much sense.
---
I'm confused. I'm on Xbox and my loading screens ONLY come from the pics I've taken.  This is default, i never selected this as an option.
---
All the time! Try fast traveling to different areas and see if you can get him to drop someplace funny!
---
88
---
I got that achievement a while ago. It's description is wrong. In fact I got it without reading magazines but simply finding them. So yep, it only counts when you find them and pick them up, but you don't have to read them.
---
Oh okay, interesting. I could separate the bulk to 0 for low players and a small amount for 1 cap for the challenge
---
You get free bubblegum every 5 levels in the perk packs.  Not too hard to keep a few in your stash.
---
Confirmed I have multiple versions - light ultralight, heavy, pocketed et al.  The plan is listed as ‚Äúlegs‚Äù So seems like one plan will do both sides
---
values varied berween500 and 700.  I normally list at 1/2 value
---
Jesus Christ. One by one I'm finding out all the rewards I'm looking forward to unlocking in the Legendary Run are bugged or unsatisfactory in some way. Why should I bother? Is there anything wrong with the Fireplace door before I go and get my hopes up about that? My money's on yes.
---
Guess i'll have to hunt for them then
---
Interesting I‚Äôll keep doing that then
---
All the time.
---
Well my wife is from England, im from Brisbane, Australia.
---
I usually price items at 1 cap because I don't want to be that person who over prices stuff. But I also don't know what to set the prices for on somethings. :)
---
Holding onto 5-10 bubblegum isn't difficult. Stop moaning over nothing.
---
Screenshot that. You may have the Uber rare dual PA plan
---
I've heard that doesn't work for the ammo generators. Even deleting them keeps them in the camp budget.
---
One of your armor pieces has chameleon so if you‚Äôre holding a weapon and crouch you‚Äôll turn invisible
---
But why? it's the irony but as soon as you start following certain achievements that rely on luck you'll find yourself out of luck. Magazines are pretty easy to come by. I mean if you absolutely want the achievement right now then sure :p FO76 map can help with that I think
---
Sounds like a friend isn‚Äôt a friend.
---
for the couple of commenters reacting as if this were a "play my way" post, how is the OP doing that? there's no imperative, just a conditional if/then construction which basically boils down to an "I like \_\_\_\_" statement. i have pure disdain for "play my way" posts but this is not one.
---
I would file for a chargeback with my cc and put the screenshot of "Already Canceled" as proof. May loose the account, as companies have to pay for charge backs. Have you tried email?
---
I've played a decent amount and I literally never found a briefcase until I got the briefcase tracker perk lol. First match that I wasn't bush camping after I got the perk I found one thanks to the perk. It's very powerful, I strongly reccomend it
---
I completely agree with camp budget increase. It can clearly handle much more items in the game why limit us so hard.
---
Winner winner! 
---
I'll let myself out.
---
I have sent a private message, but I'm not sure it reached you or you noticed it.
---
I'm not crouching.
---
Just wait til you see the ass on the white power armour skin, it looks like a beak lol. I think the door is OK, apart from the fact everyone will know its a secret door :)
---
It might not have to be crouching. Just check your armor and there should be a perk on them
---
Then some idiot (like me) will see it and be like, "Why TF are these prices not matching!?" üòÇ
---
It's the last achievement that i need to get and i'll have all for 76. Besides i play since launch so i really want that gone
---
I'd already learned the plan, and here's the screencap I took from MODUS still selling it.  [https://imgur.com/a/tbqWb26](https://imgur.com/a/tbqWb26)

(Insert Red vs Blue image)
---
Team killing fucktard
---
(Said with love and giggles)
---
XD whelp
---
I sell everything cheap.(I have an special disgust for the trophy heads so i have the plans on sale for 1cap) and I prefer keep things moving then have some expensive shit forever in there. Even my husband goes to my camp and buy my chems for the daily quests and sometimes buy guns and armor because "im selling it way too cheap" lol. He's a level 300 and I'm 100. Idk why he wants my üí©. ü§£
---
Woah. That's impressive. Alrighty then, good luck hunting!
---
I got to see that happen yesterday. It‚Äôs pretty funny when that happens.
---
Actually about to do another run right now
---
You look at what you did! - Bethesda
---
You could buy plans that people always want. For instance Fixer plans. You get 6-10k for them.
---
Both major offenders already came back with all inventory from their thirty mules.
---
Every drop I‚Äôve ever had from a 3* enemy or scorchbeast has been garbage.  I have a load of stuff I need to scrip but I keep hitting my daily limit super quick.  May take me another week to offload all these junk legendaries...
---
Was it possibly the mod? because those things are common as shit. I usually have 1 or 2 in my inventory at the end of the day
---
NW comics don't count.
---
Also you have to find the magazines in the world yourself.
---
This is the route I use usually get about 10 out of the 33 possible spawns.
---
https://youtu.be/OMvyhaE8V5k
---
Ever since the first challenge, I‚Äôve been hoarding bubblegum for the next occasion.  I also have a bunch of halloween candy..
---
Screencap doesn't do shit. Bethesda just tells you it sucks to suck better luck tomorrow.
---
Fr
---
Eybots once!
---
Yes, just not the XP and I am unsure when it comes to the scortched beast queen.
---
Definitely understand that
---
After hours of trying to get it to work, I finally got it to run.    
---
I (eventually) reset folder permissions, reset the Windows Store, re-added user permissions to the folder, then had to right click the game's exe and run it with Adminstrator Privileges.  
---
However, I went through the character creator, made my dude, went through the vault's GTFO party, and then the game crashed.    
---
Opened it back up, re-made my character, went through the party again, stepped outside, got to those two treasure people, and all game audio stopped, no SFX, no dialogue, no music.  
---
I lol'd and uninstalled immediately.
---
Not really crashing but when I first start out and try to mod or fix my weapons, it slows down to a halt...
---
It does work together and it works correctly for me. Today I was crafting some plasma cores and was disappointed that super duper didn't work until I realised I forgot to equip it after I removed another card -.- maybe you did too? it could be just bad luck after all.
---
I just bought the bungalow and when I went to place something next to the wall I realised that you can just walk through the whole building
---
Thank you, I really appreciate this comment. Lots of people calling me entitled for no reason lol. I don't think they understand what that word means but oh well.
---
Ive found that same instance with the legendary in Watoga Med multuple times.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/tbqWb26](https://imgur.com/a/tbqWb26)
---
Why would you copy a post less than24 hours old.
---
Really looking forward to meat week this year. 
---
I‚Äôm hoping they bring back the Halloween event too..
---
That is impressive.  I didn't find it easy to collect enough ore by myself....only got to 17.  :(
---
Hear you, I miss having them up at top of the world as well. But they removed them all now.  I'm hoping with the promised level appropriate creature spawn that maybe they will bring some of them back into the mix.  I also hope they up the level caps at that time as well.
---
I found one that didn‚Äôt even say it was a legendary, imagine my surprise when I got the legendary enemy has mutated notification
---
It's a good one.   If you do well on it, you can get 4 t notes.   Even if it fails, you get a ton of XP, loot and some legendaries.   As long as you can handle the radiation, it's great either way.
---
The mods removed it because I didn't put a spoiler tag
---
youre gonna have to suck it up Im afraid...
---
How are you roleplaying?
---
Between the healing boost from the First Aid perk and the combination of the Chemist &amp; Super Duper Perks, I no longer have problems in that area;
---
At rank 3 the First Aid perk provides 45% extra healing, which means that a diluted Stimpak that generally heals only 30% health (20% almost instantly &amp; 10% slowly over time) will now heal 43.5%, almost half of you life bar.
---
With the chemist (1 rank only) &amp; super duper (3 ranks) perks you can mass produce diluted stimpaks in large quantities:
---
The Chemist perk outright doubles the amount of anything you craft at a chemistry workbench and the super duper perk can give up to 30 % chance of further doubling those results.
---
Normally you can only produce 2 diluted stimpaks from a regular Stimpak. With this setting you can constantly produce 4 diluted stimpaks out of each Stimpak and 30% of the time you will produce 8 diluted stimpaks.
---
In raw numbers, this means that from 10 regular stimpaks you will get approximately 52 diluted stimpaks.
---
Don‚Äôt have regular stimpaks? Chemist &amp; Super Duper can still help you:
---
With Chemist alone, 2 tick blood produce 2 blood packs, which you can turn into 4 stimpaks and then into 16 diluted stimpaks. If Super Duper kicks in at any point in the process, the resulting amount can only go up.
---
Hope that helps!
---
The way Super Duper interacts with Ammosmith is that, if it triggers, it will duplicate the BASE amount of ammo, not the amount Ammosmith creates.
---
So if you craft Ammo that normally gives 100 units per craft, and 180 with Ammosmith, you will only get an extra 100 if Super Duper activates, not 180. So 280 Total instead of 360.
---
In cases like Fusion/Plasma Cores, if Super Duper activates, it will only give a maximum of 1 extra core, regardless of Ammosmith. But random is random. Sometimes you can craft 10 Cores and Super Duper will not activate.
---
I put up all of my known plans for 0 caps, but I'm prolly gonna have to stop because some guy takes all of them at once. usally a low level but still, I don't think anyone needs 7 ultracite helmet plans lol
---
Yeah, me too, can't wait to see if they add any new recipes this year. The cosmetics are good enough tbh. I'm sure they will, that was a big hit with people who played
---
It doesn't double up on ammosmith, just the base amount.
---
Thats one of the reasons I have been ignoring the thing until "A Colossal Problem" comes out. Just a big resource drain atm.
---
Well then it probably just didn't proc, it's a chance after all :)
---
Same as in adventure. Open your pipboy and look at the options on bottom of screen, you can place it anywhere in the NW map
---
You‚Äôre good
---
I'm rank 30 or so üíÄ went on vacation at the worst possible time
---
I am the bush wookie hunter.  I drink their blood in nuclear winter.
---
If anything it's shown me the perks of using bubblegum, I usally just dropped it
---
That‚Äôs the reality of FO76 ‚Äòpvpers‚Äô, if they can do real PVP they‚Äôd be playing other games. Exploits such as duped weapon, duped ammo, duped chem, duped food and legitimized aimbot is the only way to make themselves look remotely ‚Äògud‚Äô in a video game.
---
Please tell me PC so I can buy metal building set from you
---
Ok, I wasn‚Äôt sure because I don‚Äôt often craft just once when doing it, but thought that I had before and it doubled.  I must of just been mistaken, thanks for clarifying for me.
---
You have to be at a close distance, and in the case of certain enemies you have to reach a damage level
---
It‚Äôs a quest item during settlers, have you defo missed?  It‚Äôs in the Chinese hidden base.
---
I've seen several over the last few weeks.  Just normal loot, but they have the legendary tag.
---
I've had the Settler skin on mine since Wastelanders started with no problems.
---
There's a second on at the lighthouse as well. It's in the farmhouse on a desk in the upper floor.
---
Ima start doing that for junk when I finally settle down at this new camp location.
---
no there's no way, it's just a quest along the main story
---
Same here, also legendaries spawning halfway through the floor that fall out on death.
---
I usually dump those crap plans.
---
Oof. I'm sorry. I missed a little bit but I just grind em out at the end of the day after work. I didnt miss double xp tho...
---
I just carry it in my inventory, to my knowledge there isn‚Äôt a display yet for Nuka Cola.
---
I got a formula p plan for 50 caps.
---
Speaking of alts and switching stuff have you ever encountered this bug? I was switching between a main and an alt, using a suitcase to hold stuff, I dropped some apearal and mods including a white springs jumpsuit and a flaming pitchfork mod. On picking it up the mod had become a pitchfork and the jumpsuit disappeared. First time I've had an issue with swapping stuff.
---
Time for you to turn the game off and go outside for awhile.
---
Nah, you can‚Äôt hurt the ones you need to protect. The other ones...
---
Fellow rank 30 here... I feel your pain.
---
Ugh yes! I have to be more chooses about who I hook up with in the Wastelands.
---
I missed everything, i don't care about finishing I just want the cap cosmos, not like I'm ever gonna use it but I want it just to have it
---
When people stop buying them, I‚Äôll stop stocking them.  Mounted heads are a waste of space, but I made 6k selling ultracite plans already today.   I‚Äôm as tired of picking them up as you are of seeing them, but I‚Äôm a slave to supply and demand.   I sell tons of those nuka colas as well, you‚Äôre not the only person to want to see more of that
---
Makes you wonder.  I specifically look for unyielding, bloody and unknown plans.  10 seconds max.
---
Excellent progress.
---
come on, that's like advancing doing basically nothing? they're supposed to be challenges, they're already pretty easy but not too much so you'd have to move your ass a little.
---
yeah man I was going pretty good and then I went on vacation for 10 days, still here for 3 days and damn am I mad üòÇ
---
Yes, make certain to thank all those cheating dupers for destroying what little economy this game has left.
---
I swear some people open a vendor and then decide to make a 5 course meal
---
With the 150 scrip per day limit making it to where you only get 3 rolls a day...its depressing.
---
I ask my trustworthy friends to transfer my 30k to one of my 4 mules.
---
It‚Äôs a grind, but you‚Äôll get through it.
---
Feels bad man. :(
---
Not happy at all about this, but thank you for confirming it... at least I know for sure to stop wasting my time going back to previous places and looking around for clues that aren't there. 
---
I'll have to spin some bullshit excuse to do this, but I guess it's still an exercise in roleplaying around difficult situations.
---
Are you on Xbox by chance?
---
Fallout, not Fortnite please.
---
When WWIII destroys our world is the outfit every survivor will wear to increase his chances
---
I don't know what I'd thought it would look like. A bit disappointed but I guess I could grow to like it.
---
I am!
---
You have to do it.
---
I can give you a keycard. I‚Äôll even help you run through the silo if you want.
---
reloading works for me playa
---
I‚Äôm 47 and i‚Äôm not even really trying that hard, out of curiosity does anyone know when it ends?
---
It does not make sense at all for Bethesda to keep on putting camp items into the Atomic Shop for players to buy but we literally run out of camp budget, so we have to delete something from the camp to put in the new item you just bought and then the next atomic sale the whole sorry saga starts again.
---
Especially the bigger items which take up a huge chunk of the budget, come on Bethesda come to the party and give us increased camp budget, I know if you do it won't be long before that new budget limit is reached but at least we will be able to make use of some of the items you have sold us previously.
---
You‚Äôre ahead of schedule
---
Same exact way. Open pip boy then LB
---
i mean your not wrong, not because its faster but because it would remove the biggest no clip bug available
---
Modus can give you coordinates for a cargo bot. 
---
But I simply wait until I spot 3x vertibots as they are generally escorting one. Shoot them all down, unlock the cargo and it will provide a new key...i have 9 waiting for use.
---
That's a fucking crappy behaviour. You can locate another cargo bot using the same computer you used for the first card at the Whitesprings Bunker
---
I agree with you but it's nice to have silly stuff over serious stuff too sometimes. Different tastes for different people. Just so long as they don't favor one over the other
---
I had this issue for over 3 months, I almost quit the game its so frustrating. I fixed it though. A few days ago I thought id try a scan and repair of the game files from the launcher. I havent had fast travel fail since. Give this a try.  
---
Ill warn you though it may reset any changes you've made to the .ini files like if you removed motion blur, blood spatter or anything like that.
---
Wow didn‚Äôt miss out on too much
---
Yeah I love cosmetics and camp items. If that‚Äôs all we got I‚Äôd be pretty content with it
---
Well you can still do the quest but choose different dialogue options along the way
---
Who can't appreciate a pair of udders like that :(
---
You could make healing salve.  It isn't as strong as a stim, but it does nicely in a pinch.
---
Can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve seen that. Pretty sure it doesn‚Äôt work on two different types of Pennsylvania. Gotta be a typo or something
---
can confirm, yesterday found none, today after removing it found 3 caps ones, a leader one, 2 endurance ones, a medicine one and 3 explosive ones.
---
Yeah, I finished the story with raiders without doing that mission
---
Don't forget there's also one in perk packs. After a while you're probably like me and have a ton of unopened ones.
---
I‚Äôm Enclave to the core....BGS has given us dick so far.
---
Two pairs actually
---
I hate scrip daily limit, but...i like to give weapons and armor to low lvl players. I do leaders of the pack event in forest just to have some items to give (fresh players tend to ignore it)
---
I actually did get a three star weapon from a one star enemy once. Not sure how it happened, but I‚Äôm not complaining.
---
It‚Äôs on the roof so just find the stairs that take you up there, the markers are always wonky when you need to do stuff like this
---
It can be a good bug as mentioned previously about the wing fragments etc but it is a bitch when you forget and fast travel back to your camp and the damn things are draped all over your vendor machines.
---
So far it seems to work for neither. I have the regular optimized bracers for my X-01 but no "Ultracite Optimized Bracers" unlocked. I also do not have the option to craft the Optimized Bracers on my ultracite armor
---
Yeah, maybe it could cost a fusion core or 2.
---
You can in fact skip right over the Raider and Free States portion of the main quest and immediately start with Brotherhood of Steel and then Enclave quests. Poke around at Camp Venture to start BoS and the Abandoned Waste Dump in the Mire for Enclave. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean your character skips the knowledge for it. There are plenty of references to events pertinent to the BoS and Enclave lines that stumbling into the content can still align with roleplaying imo. It‚Äôs also worth noting you do have to work with Rose until you can at least meet her face to face in order to do the Wastelanders main quest as well
---
Damn, I know how it feels. I was in the process of doing this quest too, got to the moment when you need to clear a silo, but decided to leave that for another day. Later I got a few new "friends". we got into a group. while me and one person were doing something, the other one decided to launch a nuke and ta-daaa my quest autocompletes and I have no idea how to do it! Good thing later some kind people explained me and directed to some guides. I also now always kill the vertibird and that bot with a package whenever I see them, so I have a few cards now.
---
I once bought one from a neighbour for 500caps and when i went back to my camp they were there at my vendors. I have 4 Formula P for 4k in there. D:
---
You do not lose your card, just go back to the same silo and run it again. When launch prep completed you can go right to entering your code.
---
The previous poster was mentioning adding easy challenges as extras. Those are easy. Searching for bubblegum is not enjoyable gameplay. I'd much rather have a 'defeat the queen in under x minutes' style of challenge. Something that is actually an accomplishment and not a mildly inconvenient irritant.
---
I'll give it another go tonight. I've seen them set on there before. We all know how wonky camp items are lol!
---
Just start lobbing pumpkin grenades at their feet, they move along quickly after that.....
---
HA! Yeah. I find even if something is only 10 caps those kinds of people don't take them.
---
Back in my day my gun would heal enemies not kill them
---
That is SO weird, if I go to my PA station and want to craft, X-01 Is under prototype power armor and ultracite is down the list under T-45 and T-51b
---
You should be able to get it I‚Äôm barley rank 15 honestly could care less about the legendary run
---
Kind of just a hopelessly optimistic nice kid who genuinely believes in the whole "rebuilding humanity" thing -it's naive, but as a Vault baby that's all he knows.
---
So far he's been following the trail of the Responders desperately trying to find some sign of life and civilization, and it's been easy since for all he's found they were decent people. This is the first point where I've been really pushed against the wall about how far my character's willing to go in his search.
---
tbh I know the right answer for this character in particular would be to refuse and walk away even if he lost the trail, but... I do wanna finish the story, so I'll have to find a way to roleplay around this even if he loses a bit of himself in the process. Of all the games to choose not to play a morally gray character in, I had to pick the one that would put me in this pinch, lol.
---
This‚òùÔ∏è. If you are on Xbox I can help you clear the silo. I‚Äôm on cool down anyway
---
So Bethesda logic is banned the people for duping due to having terrible rng with the 3* legendary enemy, but not banned any scammers who plague players from their rare drops, especially ones that can‚Äôt be replaced.
---
Tbh I couldn't care less about the economy, more items in circulation means more players can have harder to get items.
---
Tbh, does a secret underground government that's supposed to be a secret really need camp items showing their colors?
---
Right. I feel the same way bout the Red Asylum lol
---
Keep telling yourself it's for the greater good!
---
Of which building, because I'm not finding anything one the roof of the research center nor the observatory.
---
If you like nukes and queens join our discord WLR. We send them all day
---
I would stay with you build but get a low level gun to ‚Äòtag‚Äô enemies that he can kill.  He will get the xp (as do you) but should catch up fairly quick.
---
So are you playing other games like Arma currently or you have just played them in the past with no issues?  This game really shouldn't mess with temperatures any more than other games.
---
Sometime in September is all I know
---
I have it but I actually wear it, I love the way it looks, I've had every rare outfit in my possession at one point or another but I cant really choose a favorite
---
Same I also leveled two other alts. Mainly for scripping purposes but it's been a helluva time for this.
---
One time I was doing the challenge and this one players vendor was selling .38 for three caps per bullet
---
True, but they cannot please everyone. Someone's always gonna be salty, it's just the way people are. Players don't play the game the same. I gotta admit this bubblegum hunt also annoyed me a little bit, because I have speed demon mutation which makes my character hungry and thirsty all the time and very quickly, so whenever I get bubblegum I just use it. well now I know I have to save it..
---
If this is a glitch, fallout 76 is gonna have a big problem
---
Are you on ps4 by any chance? I have a medics lever action rifle on my chatter I don't play anymore.
---
I always keep my caps at 20k or below. When I get over I go looking for ammo to buy from other players since I use the ammo weight perk. If someone buys a bunch of stuff from me and pushes me close to 30k I go buy recall cards.
---
Oh wow that's a really good guide! Cheers bud
---
You‚Äôre talking about the mission where you have to plug something in to the astronomy place for modus right? There‚Äôs a console under a small canopy on the roof that you can interact with, the first time I did it there was no marker and it took me like an hour to find the spot without it
---
I use it sometimes with the toothy mask so I look like a psycho. Pretty funny. Now I'm wearing an imposter sheepsquatch outfit with ghillie hood whilst wearing the forest scout mask. It looks pretty legit.
---
So do I. But there is a display case for items. I have stored some of my more rare nuka's in there like the nuka shine I got from a quest with a drunk robot.
---
The last few times I did it I was the only one collecting ores. Seems people are over-fixating on xp and can't be arsed collecting ores which kind of sucks because I'd like to get my hands on those barrel plans.
---
Given how everyone absolutely *loves* Ward it's very clear what faction everyone should choose.
---
**Raiders.**
---
I can‚Äôt even cancel mine for some reason I go to the website to cancel and says I have no recent purchases or subscriptions I‚Äôve contacted them about a week ago but still no response
---
imposter sheep with sack hood, and tattered field jacket with the white responder fire helmet are my two favorite outfits, I miss my tattered field, probably trading for it when I get home
---
Back texture is flipped. The hinges leave the frame.
---
Other than that, it's an alright item.
---
Yeah, I guess since we're all in it then it's not really a secret lol
---
That thing is so small I never notice it, I‚Äôll have to check
---
Something like warframe would be nice. 
---
They have riven mods, but there's more customization you can get on top of that because of the rarity of those mods. They're not like legendaries where you get one in literally every major location you visit, sometimes even multiple in one area. Better yet, they can actually make potentially ANY weapon useful. In f76, having a strong effect like bloodied or junkie's just increases the gap between the fixers and handmades of the game and literally anything else. In warframe, each weapon has a riven disposition, so the weak underused weapons gain massive buffs. Some as much as +400% damage and +150% multishot. Combine that with warframe having hundreds of weapons, and you actually have some build variety, not just a choice between the obvious superiors or intentionally gimping yourself.
---
There are also difficult end-game sorties, with a bit more variety and challenge than just "big enemy that has 30000hp and 70% damage resistance and hides in the sky for 90% of the battle". I always enjoy the spy missions, you can use a stealth frame for easy mode but I like going in with a loud frame like rhino and seeing how you can make it work.
---
If you're done with that, you can go to the open world of the plains or fortuna and just screw around with fishing, mining,  hoverboarding, trying to craft the ultimate pet, or just crashing spaceships into each other. 
---
There is the never-ending end game of fashion frame, with far more customization options than f76 will ever have. Dozens of paint sets that each have dozens of color shades, multiple customization points on every frame/weapon, and countless different trinkets like capes and armor.
---
If you get bored with all of that, every few weeks they release a new set of weapons and/or a new frame (or a prime version of an existing frame) to grind for. Meanwhile this game has patches once every month and a half or so, and a meaningful content update 1-2 times a year.

You know, any one of these points individually would at least give this game the ability to say that there *is* an end-game. Right now it's just grinding for time-gated resources and spinning the RNG wheel. But they don't lead up to anything bigger, so there really isn't any end-game yet. Hopefully we get there one day though
---
No. The quest one small step, which is for Commander Daguerre, I've already done the quests for Modus.
---
Hmmm, you have me with the idea that I could try to find the Brotherhood instead (found enough holotapes and notes about them already to know they were also fighting the scorched). Thanks for the suggestion, I'll think on my options and may go after the BoS trail instead.
---
While I don't do this and can get why you're so annoyed.. How would those people know you'd only take 10 seconds to look? Some people just like to browse and if you're in a hurry there's a voice chat. Being so worked up over this is not healthy.
---
I definitely enjoy the event as well and join it whenever it's up. But what does annoy me is some of the voice lines that go on throughout it.
---
Marion Copeland is just so damn *smug* and *cocksure* about the success of her methods.
---
"Nooormally you buy high and sell low, but in our case, we're buying for nothing and selling for as high as we can get!"
---
"The key to scavenging is to scavenge where no one else will." 
---
Oh REALLY? OH REALLY MARION? Well maybe that's because no other scavenger crew has an escort of impossibly heavily armed, Scorchbeast Queen murdering death warriors to defend you from an irradiated ghoul onslaught whose numbers rival the Chinese army.
---
Add to that all the various Deathclaws, Snallygasters, and Floaters that enter the fray and you should have quickly realized that choosing to scavenge in this area was the single DUMBEST DECISION YOU'VE EVER MADE IN YOUR LIFE. 
---
Then she has the *nerve* to get pissy at you if you fail the event when her crew dies.
---
"Maybe life is cheap for you, *bUt It IsN't FoR mE*!!"
---
I'm sorry, but did you not see what we went through to defend your friends from a literal *hell on earth?* It's not like we were squatting in a corner taking a smoke break when one ghoul out of several hundred broke through our ranks and tore through your idiot posse like tissue paper. *You're* the one who lead your team down into this suicidal death trap, you're *always* the last one left alive, and you don't even have the goddamn common courtesy to feel an *ounce* of survivor's guilt about it. Nope, you blame everything on us instead. Marion Copeland, you alone grate on my nerves more than a thousand Wards could ever hope to.
---
...And don't think I forgot about that one bug where you stole our weapons, either. Jerk.
---
Yeah.....though some ‚Äúmembers‚Äù are bigger than others.
---
Perhaps this is your characters way of discovering a necessary evil in the world, maybe the promise of finding people that need help outweighs doing some bad things to help.
---
As long as ya got one, right?
---
I hadn't seen it. Time to Google. It sounds pretty cool.
---
Encrypted key cards. Vendor hop for preferred consumables, or collector item/weapon. Buy Every plan. Need stealth boy mod on your excavator pa? Or overdrive servos for the t-60? I'm your man.
---
Create a second, third character (if you have fo 1st) and transfer them via storage bins on private server.
---
Thanks. Still weird it says 1000 at mine
---
You wins the Internetz, fine sir.
---
Any buff that gives max health or endurance will chunk you when it wears off. It just removes whatever it added.
---
I want the original 76 game mechanics when it first launched. I miss the slap damage, and camp destruction. I get that it was abused by griefers and had to be adjusted, but I'd rather deal with griefers then walk around the wasteland with no danger looming around every corner. 
---
Hopefully someday they decide to make a separate mode with all the edginess we use to have, with some balanced pvp. This game has gotten really stale since they started to systematically remove pvp from the game.
---
I get that notification all the time.

Turning the tables but I got my husband interested in Fallout 76 for a while and now he‚Äôs gone to play other games and I‚Äôm still playing Fallout 76 lol. I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôll be interested enough to come back soon üôà

the tattered field is and always has been the 2nd rarest outfit, but always gets effected by every new dupe, along with the red dress (#1), I love it, and the white responder fire helmet is the rarest headwear so I always loved walking around flexing it
---
Not gonna lie, man. You either just get over it one day or it'll just not hurt as much over time.
---
Every now and then I still think about a a girl from 20 years ago that i blew it with. I thought she was my One.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure they didn't have voice volume so you got to enjoy some stupid fucking emoji that didn't fit the situation.
---
I'm just in so much pain, she would watch me even before playing the game with me. I would stream for her everyday
---
I bet. It looks nice. I only have the wrapped cap
---
Its rough now but you will get better, give it a few days.
---
  I had similar happen recently and if you go in my post history there is a thread that many people gave me suggestions for coping with my emotions.  Exercise, even cardio helps a bunch.
---
I am est also, I am sure that my crew will be on in a couple of hours and would help you. Shoot me a friend request and join the server we are on. We useally drop three nukes then encrypted and server jump for the next group. We useally start about 8 eastern. My ign is Coolardvark
---
Thank you, I'm just suffering so much. I dont know what to do
---
Everytime it happens I think of Monty Python. "There's a dead bishop on the landing"

Great post OP. Better commentary and responses. I enjoyed this discussion and you made some very valid points. Watching extra credits now while I cook dinner.

You were just in NW

Why does it matter if you're over 400? Item level caps at 45-50

Oh im fine dude, its just annoying when people dont have general manners, I literally wrote it because I was on reddit waiting for my cousin to stop shopping, as soon as she finished i pressed the button only to find a rando cut me off and he was still in there after i finished writing the post, nobody was ‚Äúraging‚Äù I was mildly infuriated and had the timeüòÇ

Welcome to the paid beta version 0.3 comes out next week,  for 1000 atoms will put a b on the end to make you feel better
---
On steam? You can put the exact amount in your wallet instead of linking cc or paypal. Then no autopays work, use the website over the app. Edit the web page and you can change the 10 dollar add button to whatever. 10 will be a value of 1000, change to 1299. The auto renew thing can be blocked in paypal too if you don't want to do that. Storing CC information is something I only do on sites like amazon.
---
What's weird is back on the bethesda's launcher, you had to change your paypal password too. Beth wrote their own browser early on to put in your login info! What that was all about who knows, always changed my paypal password afterwards.
---
They hit hard. But I 1 hit them
---
Can't say I have. Bit of an odd one, that. Sorry about the jumpsuit. So far the majority has worked out as planned or the odd occasion where the server has crashed but nothing that out of the ordinary.
---
I feel you. Blessed Godd Howard üôèüèª
---
Cause it‚Äôs a Xbox throw it out and buy a Ps
---
Yep oh its a bug?
---
Try thinking of it along this route : A brief detour to the dark side (exploring things and ways you've heard about since you left the Vault) before choosing to return and fully commit to your previous way of thinking (a bit like a post-apocalyptic Rumspringa).
---
It's been a thing for 100% of the game's existence. They used to actually drop legendary items a very long time ago, then that got removed. Then the legendary tag got removed from their name. So for a while they existed, but were essentially equivalent to normal enemies, so it cruised on for a while with the issue swept under the rug. Wastelanders changed the way legendaries heal though (it used to be a slow regen of about 150% of their hp, so you could potentially out-damage the regen; now it's a nearly instant heal, and it gives a different message) which made these fake legendaries also start healing, something they didn't do before. I haven't seen any of them named as no star legendaries recently though, so that could be something new with the seasons update. Or maybe the game is just falling apart and reverting to old code, it wouldn't be the first time
---
It's the one event I find challenging and actually enjoy.
---
Mr.Gutsy would lik- \*pew pew\* -DEAD
---
Either try to get her back, or move on. I‚Äôm not talking about begging her either. I‚Äôm talking about being a man, and either admitting you messed up somewhere, or telling her you will change and do things differently. Obviously I don‚Äôt know the whole story, but she‚Äôs gone right? She left for a reason? Whatever that reason is? Fix it. If you can. If not? Yes, it‚Äôs not easy. But speaking from experience? You will move on eventually. Who knows? You might find someone better?
---
With the blocker perk at max they aren't as bad, but they still can kill me if I'm not paying attention as a bloodied build.
---
Get better gear and better perks. This game does not need to be easier.
---
I mean, they do a buttload of damage, and I could see getting killed by a swarm of them if you aren't careful.
---
But getting Oneshot? That shouldn't be a thing, even without Legendaries or Perks. Some part of your build is making you super weak to those sharp, crispy fingers.
---
I'd reverse nerf them if I could.
---
I know it's annoying but just like in real life some slow person can stand in front of you it is so in the game. but please don't call such people those mean words you used, the community (most of it) is really nice and I'd hate to see it fall and being as toxic as in other games.
---
That's what my family is saying, but I dont know. I cant contact her, she ghosted me after so long. Jusr said she loved me then blocked me on everything. I don't know what to do
---
Just let it hurt for a while - cut yourself some slack right now.  And whatever you do, make it a clean break.  Don't force something that didn't work out.  
---
7 billion people on the planet - after the pain is gone (and it will go away), plenty of other people to meet and make connections.
---
Sorry to hear about your break up but I promise you'll be okay dude even though it may not feel that way. Anyone worth keeping in your life especially as a partner will never leave, so she obviously wasn't the one even if you were so sure she was. You've got to remind yourself that you'll eventually find the person that will stick with you, but for now you've got to focus on yourself. Do the things you love but also take care of yourself. Remind yourself of just how great and unique you are, as it can be easy to lose that in relationships sometimes. I recommend trying new things, and maybe putting aside the things that remind you of her for now until you're past this worst part of the pain. But its good you're crying. You've got to let that shit out. Journal your thoughts and feelings to as bottling it up will just make it take that much longer to move on.
---
Omg! Just looked at your name and realised I‚Äôve been following you and your wife on Insta for ages now! Small world! :D
---
I don‚Äôt think they were a duper. They had two other legendaries for sale, both with pretty lackluster effects and weapons.
---
Distract yourself. Do stuff that she had nothing to do with.
---
Been there man. Had my heart broken so bad I stayed single for seven years in my 20s because of it and am now married and have three kids. Just try to keep the perspective of the fact that in ten years it will have very little if any impact on your life. You got this bro!
---
That's a good way to think about it. :) Thank you, it helps put things in perspective for this character a bit.
---
Sorry you are going through this. 
---
There is nothing that any one person can say to heal a wound like that. Maybe it is a good idea to take a break for a little bit. If you are able, travel a little bit. See new things, hike, workout. Talk to your support network, friends and family. 
---
It will hurt. Nothing can change that, but, it will get better. It‚Äôs only a solace of comfort I know. Just breathe and know that each day you are moving closer to healing your heart. There will be hard times, don‚Äôt give up and keep your head up.
---
Don't worry about the crying mate, you have to do the mourning. Sometimes it takes a while but it must be done.
---
Keep the house and yourself clean and keep your head occupied. One day you'll feel strong again
---
Simply bloodied
---
Plans are the only thing you can really invest in, but that's limited. If you stock your vendors regularly, it's surprisingly easy to buy all the mutation recipes and all the PA plans. Once you have the vendors cleared out, the only things left to buy are from player vendors, and those will rarely have what you want. Buying any kind of items to hold on to is not reliable. For one thing, there's always that tiny chance bethesda will follow through on their promise of a balance pass, and whatever you bought becomes obsolete. The far more likely scenario is that the next dupe wave in a week or two will plummet its value down to pennies since bethesda will never remove the duped copies and they'll just suspend the cheaters for another week, if at all. Not to mention that whatever you bought will be sitting in your stash taking up your already extremely limited space
---
It feels like I cant do anything right now. Gaming with her everyday was such a big part, and now she's gone. I'm trying to break it away though
---
Thanks so much! I‚Äôll add you and prob join some of those nukeS
---
when you have power armor equipped your backpack doesn't count because logically you can't have it on while in power armor. Excavator power armor has this bonus, that is true
---
Ha to bad I already have one. But Xbox to me is better but I have to have a ps4 to be able to play all their exclusive games
---
Exactly im a bloodied build so they kill me way easier than I want them to haha
---
Thank you so much, I'm just bawling even harder reading that. It means so much, I feel so lost though. This game meant so much to both of us.
---
yeah im gonna try that again and see what happens, and yes i have submited a ticket, i guess im just gonna have to see what happens
---
Yeah, in my opinion, they really screwed up the leveling progression for under-50 players by getting rid of not just Lewisburg's higher-level enemies, but also the adjacent Big Bend Tunnel's enemies.  Those two locations were prime spots because the Super Mutants weren't Lv. 68s, but still flush with XP, and the nearby Lv. 68 Scorched in the tunnel were quite easy to kill for being Lv. 68.  High-level players would generally avoid that area too, since they had no reason to be there.
---
It just made that bit from Lv. 30-50 even more of a slog than it already was.
---
How are they to know you are standing there waiting to get into that particular vending machine?  Maybe you are afk after having looked or are browsing your inventory.  What indication is there at all other than being in that general area that you are waiting on that vending machine?  Maybe your just travelling around with a friend.
---
I'm really trying man, thank you for the tip. It just really hurts because she was my partner and my team for fallout basically.
---
They're basically the only enemy that can kill me (hoarder build, nothing special). Them and assaltrons. Frustrating at times but without it, boring.
---
Yeah since I have to be low health in bloodied they can easier one shot me, the only downside of my build.
---
Probably my biggest complaint in the game right now. 
---
I have found that if you slow down on your fast travel....like take 3-5 seconds in between each button push of map opening, location selection, and confirmation, it usually ends up working for me. 
---
GL
---
I‚Äôve posted about this,  psycobuff has negative influence on strength build.  Pyschotats seem to work.
---
That's so amazing, I cant travel really but I'll try the rest of it. The thing is I was so forward thinking to see the winter things with her and now I'm without her after everything she told me to reassure me.
---
Ok the point was if your max level or above max level shouldnt be one shotted by a ghoul
---
Seems you‚Äôve discovered a flaw in running around with low health... it‚Äôs a calculated risk you take, not a flaw in the game
---
Which event? The one with the mirelurks on the island?
---
I think that Bethesda honestly needs to take a large survey of its users and find what content they enjoy the most, and focus on making challenges around that instead for Season 2. As it stands, things are either too easy or mildly inconvenient yet annoying. A survey would also prevent threads such as this (and, inevitably, my karma going down for sharing an unpopular opinion).
---
Yep, I named him Jeremy.
---
Wait so the PS4 works and the Xbox doesn‚Äôt I think PS4 is way better then
---
I'll attempt email, thank you. I'll also see about a charge back. Those 50 bucks were hard earned lol.
---
If youre on playstation and get it, me and some friends can help you along and with weapons if you'd like
---
My only thought is that when you use rad x it suppresses your mutations so maybe you lose the diseases when that happens
---
I honestly don't know why they make this so hard on people. I just want my money back and to not loose anymore of it.
---
Thank you...I was forgetting to open up in pip-boy.  Operator error
---
Depends on your style. For pure damage I‚Äôd say a bloodied stealth melee followed my stealth bloodied commando.
---
Second time that's mentioned. Thank you.
---
Same,raider had no problem. And also had no problem with futurre tech skin on 2 characters, but on new ones i made for lvl up had the problen described here. Strange.
---
Weird, was thinking about this earlier.  Wondering if events trigger less if players don‚Äôt join.
---
Oh trust me I get it. The girl I'm talking about was everything to me and was pregnant. I then immediately lost my place to live less than a week later. Eventually it just stops hurting and the thought only gives you this mild tinge of anger that someone can just walk away so easily.
---
I got a level 50 in the Forest.
---
Sadly, im a console simp. But thank you so much for this!!
---
They can one-shot me when Bloodied, but only because I recently ditched Dodgy just to see what would happen.
---
I actually prefer it this way.  It's more interesting, and it makes it all the more important that I drop the Ghouls quickly, because if I get to \[DANGER\] with them, I'm going to be in real trouble.
---
But with Charreds, you can run Blocker, Serendipity, or Dodgy.  The thing that gets you is the Rad Damage, which is why I think it's important to have RadAway (Dliuted) on your Favorites wheel somewhere, because it normally has no hotkey and you won't be able to fumble through the Pip-Boy UI when a Ghoul is swinging at you.  Having armor with the +25 Radiation Resistance (or armor with innate resistance) can help a bit as well.
---
Yeah I get the assultron frustration as well like when I first did the mission for ra ra but your right game would be boring without them. With my bloodied shotgun inno longer have to worry about assaultrons blasting me luckily
---
Not a scorchbeast, but I've had a radstag drop out of the sky on me.
---
No actually I just had to buy another ps4 being the disc drive stopped working and it would sound like a fucking plane taking off. This is first problem I had with Xbox and it simply just shut off twice so I figured I would come to see if anyone else was having problem. But hey man if you like ps4 better awesome I don‚Äôt care what anyone likes because I like both of them.
---
Yes, waiting for my cousin to be done while pressing x on the vending machine only to find another person cut me off in the split seconds after she finished, and takes literally 5 minutes+, i get what you are trying to say, but this scenario was literally the perfect example of someone doing it to be an asshole
---
I'm so bad.... I'll wait around for someone to buy something from me first. 
---
Actually, I have my camp near the Wayward and purposely have most of my stuff really cheap for new players. I even mod up leather armor and simple weapons to sell to them. 
---
And I buy lots of stuff from other ppl, too. I just don't worry about that quest first usually.
---
Yeah thats a good point does make me want to down them soon as I see them just always miss one somehow haha
---
If you‚Äôre running about at 19% health absolutly they should one shot you. It‚Äôs not known as a glass cannon build for nothing. All the damage. Lil bit squishy
---
I agree. This is why I constantly provide them a feedback. I came to FO76 from another game where the Devs didn't give a shit about their players so I was pleasantly surprised with Bethesda taking time to adapt. But it's not a fast process. I think after this season ends they'd take some time to evaluate the results. But there's no guarantee to that. I just feel like some people (not saying you or OP) complain a bit too much.
---
I'm level 162 and still haven't finished the mission for Ra Ra üòÇüòÇ it was way too hard when I started at whatever level I was, and I'm definitely traumatised from it
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plague\_Walker](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_Walker)  Diseases do not cure themselves over time. Never using rad x or anything :/
---
I just had these stupid false Hopes. She promised me so much, swore even on my own self that I had nothing to worry about and she just abandoned.
---
I dont mind the bloodied build. You trade your health for very high damage, thats how i think of it. To me it seems better than sinking loads of lead into enemies and hardly putting a scratch on them.
---
I know this is an old post but your saved me thanks
---
What?! What items do u display it on
---
I was just saying cuz rad x suppresses it
---
Touch wood,I‚Äôve never come a across griefers in the game, only ever nice players,who are quick to share supplies etc
---
At a time like this you need a different game for a while.  If this game is reminding you too much of painful stuff, take a break.  Or if you don‚Äôt want to do that maybe make a new character and start over.
---
You have to attack to be killed so if you don't want to be killed then don't attack
---
Set pacifist mode, it will take less time than creating this post
---
I just want to be a diseased ghoul, why does bethesda do this
---
Now I have 4 characters with tons of extra stuff on them.
---
When the one comes along you won't even need to have hope man. You will just be sitting there one day and go "holy shit I'm getting married tomorrow how did that happen!?" Lol
---
I used it and made a new camp on both my 2 alts and the skin applied correctly and it's working perfectly.
---
Then yesterday and today i made a new character each day for the lvl up daily, and both times when i placed down a camp, it glitched and my new camp wasn't on the map. I don't know what the criteria to make it work are, but my 2 working camps are basically just 1 decorated greenhouse.
---
Literally never seen this happen. Why you gotta come on here an lie?
---
Theres so many pictures of us together on the photo album too and I'm even hyperventilating right now about it. I just was to forget everything.
---
Oh, well I use a bloodied Gauss Rifle and bloodied Spiked Knuckles that deal 50% more limb damage. The spiked knuckles I have deal 470 something damage (that's including the talons mutation) and they seem to be a pretty good counter to feral ghouls since they always like to get in your face.
---
I my opinion, displayed items via the various display shelves including bobbleheads, and magazines shouldn't affect your budge at all, only the base item(container itself). 
---
The longer I play, the more I feel that budget is becoming a bigger and bigger issue even with all the tips and tricks out there.
---
You are either stuck with a tiny house that is filled with stuff or a big base that feels barren or you have the awkward step child, which is my bases, that strive to be bigger and still feel filled. All options suck. 
---
The shelter idea seems interesting BGS, but it kinda defeats the coolness of having a camp in the open vs behind a loading screen.
---
Fr I‚Äôm hoping they work with me soon cause my subscription renews on the 8th and I really don‚Äôt wanna pay it it‚Äôs a waste
---
Never attacked. I was leaving a workshop and he activated it, commencing and attack in which I did not unsheath my axe.
---
I'm curious how they are killing you without you engaging in PVP? As they do zero damage if you ignore them. Also you can always just turn on pacifist mode.
---
Got to agree with you there. Most of the offerings in the current season are very lack luster and underwhelming. Only a couple of items I really like and all are near the end of the board, hardly worth the effort. BSG really needs to step up the loot if the expect us to keep grinding through the seasons.
---
This is the best comment I've read so far in F076 related posts haha. Couldn't agree more.
---
This isn‚Äôt about about the faulty skin but I LOVE seeing other spouses that play together. My husband and I have xboxes in different rooms of the house and play on headsets. It‚Äôs a great way to pass the time!!
---
I do have a nice meele weapon I could put on my new account
---
Not worth it. They deserve to be temp banned if they think that pvp is the answer to everything.
---
So you want me to play everyday and level up 5 lvl to just get bubblegum ?
---
I just wish I could have as many displays as I want. Kinda dumb I can‚Äôt display every weapon in the game because ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve exceeded the number of this item‚Äù
---
I really wish I had that, I really do. My heart aches, and I dont mean to sound like a baby, but she was my everything.
---
Not lying. Speaking from personal experiences. Just 10 mins ago had a 365 killing me.
---
There‚Äôs always commander daguerre.....hang in there bud it will get easier as time passes
---
Nice players are often, but sparse
---
Pvp at workshops isn't griefing it's part of the workshop
---
I dont want the game to be easier, if anything its too easy already, just most creatures dont down me in 1 sec with one hit usually and I used to take on deathclaws at level 15...
---
Pvp is an easily avoidable option. If you don't want to engage don't shoot back
---
I'm 74 and a bit ahead of where I thought I would be,  but I've been off work with covid19 since July 7th...
---
Workshops. You can take one and if a player is within the circle you can attack without reason(Unless ofc said person is trying to take the workshop)
---
Pack tray ammo has consistently sought to buy low margin ammo in bulk. 
---
Come to Metalocalyspe‚Äôs next to Camden Park. Our ammo may cost more, but Metalocalypse ammo won‚Äôt secretly record your conversations.
---
So you engage on pvp activity (workshops) got killed, and came here to cry about it being griefing. \* slow clap \*
---

In all honesty I didn't know we're supposed to collect something! My quest marker wasn't showing up, could be because someone else was doing it that fast. Thanks for clearing this up! Maybe some other people also didn't know that. I've only did this event 2 or 3 times tho.

---
Never shot back. While activating a workshop pvp is enabled, and i was leaving the workshop as I had already claimed it, when MrKillEverythingInSight attacked.
---
Give it a whirl. Angry turtles videos are very good. Has one where he 4 shots the queen with melee
---
I had a level 150 kill me earlier and I'm only level 25!!!
---
I was also playing nuclear winter.
---
though the thing is the weapon displays don't have to keep track of the stats of the displayed weapon (or atleast shouldn't), the stash already does this anyway and the display only shows the basic weapon itself not its mods or even its name.
---
No you didn't.
---
So nice you said it twice. Its ludicrous that the queen drops anything one star. Makes the whole battle completely disappointing.
---
No, I was leaving the workshop and said person activated it therefore engaging in pvp.
---
Only problem with getting rad help is I use rads to make me more powerful. Which also makes me even weaker as you mentioned.
---
It was on workshop.... Thats just another "i was griefed in workshop!" person.
---
Stop playing.  That‚Äôs all you can do.  Break ups are hard, especially at first.  And this is a big reason why.  Everything you do reminds you of the person.  Things you did together get tainted.  Usually time fixes it.  But sometimes those things will always give you icky feelings.  My best advice is to do something else.  Distract yourself with something else.

---
Jocko always has good advise for emotional hardships for warriors. Maybe it will help.
---
If you have the Fasnact Collectron he collects bubblegum.
---
Nuclear Winter is fine, that's the point of it is to kill rival players, same as that old survival mode.
---
If they can one shot you, invest into serendipity, nerd rage, and blocker.
---
I just want to give up
---
Remember when the queen dropped drills instead of legendaries ... Pepperidge Farm rememberers !
---
Literally no loot is ever lost to pvp or anything else in this game. Scrap is all you lose and if you're stupid enough to be taking workshops with your inventory full of scrap, you deserve to lose it. Stop making shit up cause you think it sounds good.
---
I somehow actually forgot to loot the SBQ once. She landed on my head when I ft'd to the train station and I could loot her there. I was happy about that.
---
Have serendipity and nerd rage on rn and got downed by one...guess I need blocker too
---
And i was leaving, if someone tries to leave and you chase them down, it's stupid
---
That, is terrifying.
---
If you don‚Äôt wanna pvp, don‚Äôt claim a workshop. It‚Äôs really not that hard to comprehend.
---
Yesterday it was big red.  But today was fruit stripe.
---
I want to, I really do, but even my xbox just reminds me of her. I just hate this whole situation
---
You NEED blocker
---
Don't like pvp, don't go to workshops.
---
I once jumped back to my house from Scorched Earth and it was completely draped in 3 scorchbeast corpses.
---
It depends, I think most people are off doing their own thing and like the xp boost. Some events I love doing with a group because its just easier.
---
Thank you, it made me smile some but I cant handle this pain
---
Yeah, I have had 3 people join my events group.  As I am doing events, no one else shows up.  Not always though.  But most times.
---
EDIT:  I have had come success with using the follow me emote.  They will sometimes show after that.
---
Yeah don‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm 47 and been there at least twice. It hurts like a MF but it does get easier I promise. Grieve. Come to terms with it and move forward.
---
Interesting how you can say what I have and have not had happen...
---
You have to go to Abbie‚Äôs bunker to trigger BOS quest. Look on one of the terminals and it will trigger it
---
If you're not crouched in front of them, spamming the buy button, you're a noob.
---
Maybe take a break from the game for a while? Try being around family and friends if possible. Distract yourself with another game? It‚Äôs going to hurt unfortunately for a while. It‚Äôs almost like a death, someone you always had around is gone. Maybe focus on you as cliche as that sounds. Exercise, get in the best shape you can, then send her pics from a burner number to make her realize what she could‚Äôve had! ;)
---
When you claim a workshop you're advised that you're entering a PVP dynamic. If you don't want to engage don't defend it an go mind your business somewhere else
---
Should only get 1 think it has a 25% drop rate
---
Def gonna invest in getting that today. Thanks mate would be nice to be able to do more before I get downed
---
Totally this. If they are lighting me up with a solid weapon and I clearly see them using said weapon, it should fucking drop once I kill them. This is some backwater, claytoed, hillbilly sister fucking bullshit right here.
---
It wasn't an inventory full, but it's annoying to be killed for no reason.
---
There is a plan in the files for a vault tec themed backpack, but they haven't added it in game for players to obtain legitimately.
---
You know challenges exist right? And the man specifically came to the one I was getting.
---
I'll try those tips, right now I just wish I had her to even text to let alone speak.
---
Dang. I'm gonna have to buy something else, because this backpack looks like garbage
---
I really want to but it feels like not even my legs work
---
I think you can still make it up. I'm going to miss out on a week of challenges as well, next week.
---
I'm at 66 though, so I should be able to carch up.
---
Oh well, tough luck. It‚Äôs part of the game. Deal with it
---
I started late thinking I didn‚Äôt want to grind out the season pass... and now here I am, grinding out the season pass.
---
My favorite was all the creatures I had killed at Arkos falling from the ceiling in front of the elevator as I was trying to leave. A steady stream of animal carcasses
---
Not sure how that makes sense...
---
Because we grind events like I would think most people do for prestiege and if everyone has the reward in question than whats the point.(Rarity=value)
---
Not to mention items with resale value can be traded for items we don't have time to grind due to life commitments. But if everyone has them nobody is going to want to trade... I can go on if your still confused why cheating is bad for a community and why we just don't really care about Fo76 anymore...
---
I love my Bloodied Heavy build, I don't use PA due to having an Unyielding set, it can also be switch into a melee build
---
You can display them with skins. Does it not let you put it in your stash?
---
Claim and leave if you get killed respawn elsewhere. Its people like you that got survival removed instead of improved and why pvp was basically removed from the game. Pvp and pve was the 2 big points at launch and food builds like you ruined it
---
Just expressing my annoyance with Overlord Todd, since he hasn't created a good game since 2016.
---
There's another spaceship on the board. That's Zorbo, the bad guy. He's on level 57 today. If you're ahead of him (and you are), you're fine.
---
Highkey the worst version of that comeback I‚Äôve ever heard.
---
Time helps. If there‚Äôs no chance then clean break and just time and it‚Äôs not easy. Maybe take some time away from the online world and chill with some friends. Play some sports. Anything to get you out of the routine where she was there.
---
Struggle is real
---
Happens to me often too. Just had a guy kill me, then proceed to go bush to bush looking for people too. I'm just trying to read and get some xp, man.
---
PC here. It can also be fixed by switching to another weapon or pressing aim again. Changing between 1st and 3d person view can also help
---
Food Builds? I'm a Medic/Doctor within fallout, I'm the opposite of a fighter.
---
Grind Riding Shotgun. You can earn the plan for one of their backpack skins for free. Theres also one in the legendary run for a jangles backpack
---
The nuka projection lamp still doesn‚Äôt work too.
---
But you did lie in your post. First you say you were "just exploring" then in the comment come clean about it being in a workshop, which **you are warned is a PvP-enabled activity**.
---
You sir are a champion ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Well said.
---
Sometimes good people have to bend the rules, maybe they realize this for the first time?
---
It's more unsettling when you think about the fact that its udders are perfect crouch height
---
Ahh yes you‚Äôre right they are mods. Well good to know if I ever do find one!
---
Oh shit, didn't know that.  I just thought I was supposed to outrun the fire. 
---
Thanks a million bro!
---
don't you dare question the inconsistent daily radomizer!! all hail Todd!
---
I put them in my vendor because they sell out every time. People keep buying them so I have to keep restocking. Supply and demand my friend.
---
But a 365 shouldn't chase down a 145 while he's literally already leaving.
---
Then don't take a workshop in adventure mode. If you want to take workshops uncontested, get Fallout 1st and go to private.
---
Therapy mate.
---
Yeah, I looked too.
---
That's what my father is recommending, I'm 23 and I should be out there he says, but I truthfully loved her.
---
Idk if you're being sarcastic but I love the chaotic vibe.
---
I like it.  Just hope there is a little break between seasons.
---
Fallout first is the equivalent of a tier 3 sub, and in a highly broken game it's not worth wasting money
---
I did this to my excavator armor that had Slocum Joe paint on it.
---
And you shouldn't touch PvP activities if you aren't prepared for it. Not the point anyways. Entered PvP-enabled activity? Don't cry when you get killed. Who should and shouldn't do what isn't up to you.
---
Try using diluted rad x from now on and see if that changes anything.   Because diluted doesn‚Äôt temporarily get rid of mutations
---
Can you source that? I don't believe they've ever commented on mods besides to say they are not supported.
---
Hey, here‚Äôs some more proof they don‚Äôt give a fuck about us!
---
Try turning off auto renewal on your system
---
There is almost always bubblegum at the pumpkin house. Not to mention plenty of other locations like the fairgrounds. Stop whining and play the game, learn where to find the stuff you need. God, who called in all the crybaby's today??
---
Try meeting someone irl.
---
Sorry can't look, a S.C.O.R.E. reward is blocking my sight!
---
Honestly the most expensive item in my camp is TP as a joke because of COVID, but other than that and a piece of perfect preserved pie which is being displayed as an achievement (Bethesda please add more shelf and table display items from junk, aid and misc pls) everything else is about 500 caps at most (bolstering legendary and bloodied) where as chems, camp plans, Weapon and armour plans are about 200 caps or less, with the majority being about 50 caps and chems/food being no more than 15
---
Ammo is always a single cap
---
Oooh, the jacko stuff as well?
---
&gt;I personally feel like legendaries are way to common in this game.
---
Yeah, shitty legendaries. It may have the exclusivity to drop better loot but it seems that this rarely happens. It should be geared that:
---
One stars drop one star loot (obviously)
---
Two stars drop one and two star but more often two star.
---
And three stars drop one, two and three star. Three star most often, two star occasionally and one star less so.
---
But when I'm already halfway down the road? There's no point in attacking someone just because
---
Wow....I Didn‚Äôt know That
---
Yea, I saw the joke/piece of gum just like old trading card packs, but never realized it added the gum to my inventory.
---
Not like its overly heavy.....
---
You can display them in cases, but they are not placeable items.
---
I didn‚Äôt say get out there and hunt the women. Just hang with some mates. Have a few beers. Shoot some pool. Play some sports. Anything to take you away from the online stuff for a bit. Honestly your dads like me. We might be old and seriously uncool and embarrassing at times but we tend to know a little bit about life in our middling years
---
I would think that if a turret is on anything you can store, you're fine
---
Yeah I just open perk packs when I need the gum now
---
The free states vendor sells it
---
The xp is the only thing that really bothers my characters. I have a bloodied character and really dislike playing the build. It's too easy and he only uses one gun. I agree with your points a bit. A chameleon set is the best stealth in the game, but you can't get even close to the 30% extra xp for wearing unyielding.
---
If they would put in a death penalty like maybe, chance to drop your main weapon and it can be looted (like in lineage 2). It would cause a lot of rage though, but would make cheaper weapons more the norm. Imagine you pull out a godroll and fall into a trap. That's fallout to me
---
I'm pretty sure you can get both factions rewards until the final quest where you actually enter the vault (you'll get a warning). you can keep doing quests for both and get a lot of reputation until the moment X where you need to choose.
---
Couldn't
---
I camped out there too. I live in a little cabin/farm.
---
On a side note, where did the Greek column come from? Was that an atom shop item at some point? I saw them for the first time at a camp the other day
---
Where is that?
---
I heard you should submit a ticket if this happens. Not sure if they will actually do anything, but worth a shot.
---
Dammit! Ok, thank you üôÇ
---
Who would go to a workshop to engage pvp? Workshops are for supplies not battles.
---
The combat rifle can totally be automatic which is what most people do because they run commando, i think that‚Äôs what he means. I personally go with rifleman so I‚Äôd be totally stoked to have a .308 CR. If you‚Äôre going to blow through .308 might as well do it with an LMG though.
---
Awesome! Thank you! I just wanted to be sure just in case üòÑ
---
I can't say. I just know that his accent was a welcome surprise.
---
It's not just because. You activated PvP. You asked for it.
---
Just open perk packs if you have them left to get gum. 20 seconds to complete it
---
What does it say when you start claiming one?
---
In FO4, I was climbing tall and difficult building all the way up to find... nothing! Nothing. 
---
My wife who watched me play always wondered how come a game would not reward a player from doing extra work. 
---
FO76 is continuing this tradition lol.
---
Just wait until Wednesday when it's 3 cola, 1 strawberry, and a watermelon gum event
---
I'd say look at the events. If there's stuff at your comfort level with team leaders around, check to see if they have any vacancies. You can also simply join whichever group you want since they're public. Worst thing that could happen is that you get booted from the team
---
First Kobe now this!??? This year is bullshit
---
Technically Mr 365 did, I was leaving he activated the workshop before I had left the border, therefore getting the free kill
---
No one is saying it's hard to understand. It's the RNG that sucks. The probability of one star loot from a three star enemy is entirely wack. There should be a much greater chance to get the higher star weapons from higher star enemies.  It's so bad that the one star rolling pin might as well be a BSG/FO76 meme by now.
---
Obviously they're very slowly working back up to the "Take a photo wearing a red asylum outfit in a nuke zone while the Wendigo Colossus barebacks the SBQ - 10 S.C.O.R.E"
---
Been happening since Skyrim, lol
---
Scorchbeasts are just copied over from Skyrim's dragons.
---
Fast travelling and sometimes even just turning around will spawn them near you.
---
Wow so the campfire tales does give out possum points. Thanks I bought the carry weight plans with the points. I had 8.
---
Events are good for XP - with a big boost for being on a team.  Lunchbox bonuses and all that jazz...
---
makes it easier to get the 10k XP score bonus, and that the higher you level, the more XP it takes to make the next level (for the level up challenge)....
---
Some events also give either legendary scrip or Treasury notes....
---
Simply put it.
---
Everything.
---
Honestly, you‚Äôre welcome to join or do you own thing. I start an Event Team if I‚Äôm planning on running those, or a Building Team otherwise. 
---
You‚Äôre welcome to join, even if it‚Äôs just to get the benefit of some shared perk cards and extra XP.
---
This is some wholesome content.
---
Took the picture with photomode in-game (added two filters and played a bit with contrast etc)
---
I'll try but it's so hard
---
Riding Shotgun? Its an event you can start at Big Bend Tunnel East. Just talk to the mobster looking dude called Vinny to start it. He is located behind the Power Armor stations
---
Yes, he keeps trying to push me to feel better right now but I just want to wallow and just stop feeling the pain
---
I was really disappointed that I couldn‚Äôt shoot him in the face when I first encountered him
---
Is this only happening on PC? I'm on PS4 and this hasn't happened to me or anyone I play with.
---
There arent really harder or higher level events. There is no scalling in the game yet, so sometimes monsters are 60 and sometimes 10. Events are all the same and boring. So just join event ppl are at and enjoy the game.
---
Bugthesda strikes the millionth time!
---
I have ammo, more, clothing, and plans all ranging from about 1 to 10 caps. Come by ChattyCrawdad‚Äôs to find all sorts of things you never wanted or needed! (Seriously, though please take my stuff! I‚Äôm begging you!)
---
Honestly this and the level up challenges are why I keep a character slot empty. Rank up in NW? Make a new character and survive up to the first ring of fire. Level up in Adventure? Create a new character and run to the Wayward and complete the dialogue.
---
That would be fine if they were more rare. At least the payoff would be worth it. The way it is now, it's downright demoralizing.
---
Lol, "technically" he didn't. You asked for it the moment you captured it.
---
On PS4?  
---
Very, very often.
---
Tip top of the settlers dome spire on the antenne you will find &gt;!dissapointment!&lt;.
---
I played for 5 hours and the servers were fine on my end.
---
Yeah I think the nuke function is a bit half-assed. At the very least they could swap out all the trees for dead versions and destroy all destructible objects such as cars. It would have been an actual AAA feature if the nuke destroyed buildings and stuff but I'm trying to be realistic
---
I despise frog legs with a passion. If it was a mutation I‚Äôd be more accepting but everybody and their mother uses it and it‚Äôs super annoying try to land a hit, especially with rifles, shotguns, and melee.
---
Agreed. I scrapped my beer stein and case in a futile attempt to get some fucking space back for the raider collectotron. No dice. 
---
No dice for me means no money for you Bethesda. When are you gonna understand this concept?
---
Why does everyone want this game easier? The game is already flooded with top tier gear, even without duping.
---
I would suggest getting outside - maybe going for a walk / run or putting some focus on other hobbies. If you really want to play fo maybe find a new group to run with! You got this :)
---
Wish I could blame my internet, but no issues on anything else in the house.
---
Ops, swim in salt
---
Just join the fight when you see it pop, as long as you do 1k damage on her you should be eligible for loot.
---
When did we lose half our playerbase? Or do you mean when it was free for that month and trading was disabled due to duping?
---
I'll try to find one. It's going to take forever honestly
---
I got them the first time I completed the event. I believe this is the case for everyone.
---
 And u should. But sitting doing the things that remind you of her over and over won‚Äôt help. You need to get your mind on something else. Break the routine. Nobody‚Äôs saying u have to be doing cartwheels and forget about her. Christ I still think often about a girl who broke my heart 16 years ago.....ffs don‚Äôt tell the wife.....but it got easier and my mates helped......along with the vodka
---
I think you‚Äôll be fine but it depends on your teammates. I‚Äôm level 150 and mostly do medium and some easy level events (a few hard including Scorched Earth). But if I‚Äôm aware of a teammate under 50 that is fighting along side me I try to help, make sure they get shots in on Legendary enemies, revive them, drop some loot, etc.
---
The church in the mire that plays organ music.
---
Before getting the raider collectron I had it set to collect food, and I never ran out of bubblegum.  Alternatively, check the halloween house on the outskirts of the funfair in the northwest, there are wicker baskets that can contain enough to do this 'challenge' in one go.
---
Perhaps for you, seems like many others think otherwise
---
please don't make me waste a point on getting in/out of my PA.
---
Maybe try the discord? There are always people willing to group up and chat.
---
I barely finished the first leg of the race so far.  How do you progress so fast!
---
Have you found her yet?
---
This will make you laugh!
---
I am at 22 
---
Don't think I am going to make 100. Lol
---
same.    ps4.   i was talking about blue screens on mic with my buddy and of course the next sentence was cut off by a blue screen.
---
feels like its a fairly common reward, got several plans (PC), keep grinding!
---
Yea many other people who want this game to have zero challenge apparently.
---
People keep saying this but mine works fine everyday.
---
i have, shes in the basement and when i talked to her my option shows im still looking for her holotapes but that i have them all :(
---
Yer and the dailies 'stings and things' and ' operation tidy'
---
No, we are suggesting that you try doing a basic google search for information instead of just complaining to strangers on the internet.
---
I used this list to check off each holotape on several characters and it was all I needed each time. I even had one character that I rushed through Vault 76 and missed the first - and locked out from there after - tape, but simply transferring it to that character from another one was enough to complete the quest and turn all of the holotapes into droppable items at last. If you have all of these, it should work. If it doesn‚Äôt, submit a support ticket. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer%27s_log
---
One way to find out
---
Take a walk.  Exercise.  Read a book.  Find a tv show to disappear into for a while.  Remember, feelings are normal.  Being sad/upset. Crying.  They are normal.  You feel like this for a few days at least.  Take some deep breaths.  Listen to music.  Get yourself through a few days.  Time is your friend.
---
Entitled much? :D You have the exact same option to buy the ranks as everyone else. But you (wisely) chose not to.
---
Who cares if they show up doesnt effect your bonus any, it's either I show up and you complain about me one shotting or I dont show up and you complain about me not being there
---
At this rate yeah.
---
I thought the same thing‚Äî why the fuck is there grass and flowers still at white spring if I‚Äôve scorched the earth with a nuke? You make it work in NW but not this? What are two different studios working on the two different aspects of this game or something. Wouldn‚Äôt fucking surprise me
---
So what do yall think will happen to meet week? Like it gives you scrip but with all the ppl complaining about how low the scrip limit is, won't this event be a huge flop?
---
As you go through life you will slowly realise most people are generally arseholes.
---
I honestly didnt realise the nuka cola vaccines were sought after. I can make Nuka Scorched. I did actually make one and put in my vendor and it sold pretty quickly but i forgot to keep doing it.
---
Week 4 I think.
---
More shovels
---
Go try something else. Try a different game, take some Jiu Jitsu lessons, build some furniture, hang out with friends...
---
Who knows what is in store in the future. Go live life my guy!
---
Now I‚Äôm going to convert to pc, thinking of all the possibilities!
---
If only it worked like that. I have given up on killing those 3\* ones.
---
Image? Video?
---
Try the construction lights. Put em up high.
---
Or they use the website that gives u a valuation on items and they‚Äôre checking it to see if it‚Äôs worth buying or now. Totally oblivious the the fact that A it‚Äôs not very accurate and B right now the market is screwed
---
Makes sense since pipboy would be behind the shield that vats wouldn't work. Perhaps shield mods that do various things?? Like pheromone/honey shield keeps bugs/mires on you. Train whistle keeping mutants ghouls on you, or infrared strobe light for robots. Stuff like that? Or make Ricochet perk do more dmg with a mod using a material like, idk, ultracite or something ü§î
---
Edit: spelling
---
You're not alone - yesterday I saw that same player doing it, with at lest 29 kills in the process before they "won". What's the point? What a crock of BS.
---
I only sell the odd rarer plan or medical plans, the rest and I mean all plans I dump outside me shop door for anyone to pick up.
---
Bruh same. I'm level fifty and just hit 4000
---
My point wasn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs hard my point is that we had to do 3x as much to get the same amount of score just one day later. If they‚Äôre going to give us a challenge to eat just one for 500 then why not scale it up to something like 700 for three. It‚Äôs clearly harder than the first challenge but results in the same reward. Given for me I have 15 packs to open so I don‚Äôt have to worry, but what about the level 60 player who ate all of theirs and now has to figure out where their getting three more? It‚Äôs not fair to them.
---
Funny you should say that. I saw a vengeful mothman for the first time yesterday since before wastelanders.
---
Bruh I‚Äôve been playing since beta and I never figured out what to do! Take your upvote!
---
looks like i dont have the vault 76 one on me, so can i just make a new char and then trade it over?
---
He‚Äôs pointing out you can spend less time in adventure getting the SCORE from repeatable than bothering with that NW daily to gain an Overseer rank...he‚Äôs not wrong especially super mutant grinding with INT and do buffs
---
I dont have one, that's why I said "I think". If you want to try and find one, I vaguely remember seeing in a Juicehead video something like a tweet or a forum saying that they're not going to ban people for harmless mods. It might have been on the video where he was showcasing the inventory management mod for Fallout 76 on PC
---
Cause that would require some actual thought to be put into the game design
---
Hubba Bubba
---
Yes! Glad this is solved, I was so happy to be rid of them.
---
That's just hilariously bad - I need it
---
Triggered rant? So your long message was just you simply stating that you‚Äôre some wannabe e-chad? Or was it you ranting that you have no person self worth other than video games? Whatever you say, chump. No, im discussing you as a person. You can check my post history from back over a year ago when I was trading legacies.
---
You can call me trash all you want but at least people like me and I have self decency. You‚Äôre obviously the type that was belittled at some point so you decided that you‚Äôll belittle others. You argument fell apart so you tried to make it personal. Now you continue to try to relate your personal vendetta with Fallout. That‚Äôs typical of people who are vindictive and try to use that to win arguments. You‚Äôre a scummy person, all around.
---
Also, prove to me that you‚Äôve had those weapons. As personal drops. That‚Äôs such a bullshit straw man. You know just as well as me that you got those off a trade. Do you know how many dupes have been in the game? You think is the first one? Geez... you really think you‚Äôre special. It‚Äôs absolutely hilarious and I can‚Äôt wait for life to show you that you‚Äôre not.
---
This isn‚Äôt even about Fallout, anymore. You made it personal, so let‚Äôs debate this. Only ignorant little children would evade discussion and instead talk about how cool they are because no one else will say that to them.
---
Edit: You‚Äôre a grown ass man with the mindset of a child, I‚Äôve learned. Get a life. Talking about a video game like it‚Äôs that important to you. I‚Äôm done taking anything you say seriously. You‚Äôre a loser, lmao.
---
Yeah, I thought the same thing. I've run into a lot of misdirection with search results for this game.
---
Bruh what has working hard to achieve something have to do with entitlement?
---
I've never seen this creature.
---
I feel like this is mostly accurate, but in game, is mostly wrong. Just a few assholes in the game, and almost everyone i meet is generally helpful and kind.
---
I like the option because you can make up for the lost ranks from the bugs with the atom you earn in the season or with the one's you get from challenges that aren't daily and weekly.
---
It's the post apocalypse, manners don't exist.
---
It‚Äôs additional SCORE nonetheless. I prefer any of the challenges rather than the same grind of consumables and killing routes.
---
That‚Äôs the Point of the workshops. Pvp is part of them don‚Äôt take them over if you don‚Äôt want to be pvped
---
Hoard, always hoard... you are a dragon and the junk is your treasure!  J/k, do whatever makes most sense to you but man I‚Äôd love to have that many screws (only @ level 33).
---
Then stick to adventure and deal with the mechanics of that mode. You have two options man, whining like a pissbaby isn't one of them.
---
Honestly didn't cross my mind to get one and even if I did, I wouldn't know how to post it here. I did buy 5kish aluminum because I was running low though. Still I don't know how someone overloads their stash like that.
---
Id sell about 580 of em
---
Today i used eight pieces of toilet paper. Yesterday I used two, but I folded them into quarters, pre wipe.
---
just let them take them, it's not like you won't have 10 more in a couple of weeks anyway, just be glad to clear the stash a little imo.
---
‚ÄúKnight Moreno to... I guess no one...‚Äù 
---
Good shot
---
3 hours in a silo? I‚Äôm more impressed you had the ammo/stims to sustain such an undertaking.
---
And not being an arse is another one
---
Because they want to show you how it feels to chew five (hundred score) gum...
---
I was talking about one like this
---
*hugs you*
---
Fasnacht collectron hoards it for you
---
There's been a bug that creatures die as they spawn. I had that on my third nuke, everything that spawned died instantly.
---
You can find it very easily in food containers, kitchens, homes etc.
---
This guy really bitchin about bein killed @ Workshops? And calling it griefing? LOL
---
Also banning people for playing the game is really stupid idea to come up with.
---
Go kill a mob (just use same level before and after test) look at the xp given, and then do it again after raising your INT. The xp does increase although it may not be much.
---
So let me get straight, the lamp is broken, the camp module is broken, the ghillie skins are broken. 
---
I have to admit.  This is not a good reflection on the first season pass.
---
Yeah same for me on ps4
---
There is a globe in the lights category in the building menu.
---
ok let's her how much you get for them, as I've NEVER sold any of those plans and are just a waste of space over other items that sell a lot better and way quicker.
---
This is wizard
---
Thought plauge walker only extended the time on diseases? Not make them permanent. I remember Angry turtle (youtuber) saying something to that effect. Personally never used the mutation but sounds interesting
---
What‚Äôs the point since most people are with both and what bonus would that give the group? Not like factions have anything really for a group to do
---
old glitch that involved workshop containers
---
Yeah I was pretty annoyed the only options we had with her dialog was to "be nice" to her. So much of the game has lore scattered around regarding the Hornwrights and the Garrahans it seemed a massive oversight to not be able to discuss any of it with her.
---
It's an investment either way, through time or money. If you see value in grinding to get it, then that's where the value is for playing the battle pass. The fact that "everyone can have these skins" is the appeal of this battle pass, and the alternative of payment can be incredibly helpful for people who don't have much time to play the game. Though I do get what you mean when someone could just pay for, however many atoms they need, I met someone yesterday who had don't just that, but that's still an investment.
---
Just help her. These are the worst raiders in all of Fallout in terms of being aggressive, ruthless, and sadistic.
---
People upvoting this garbage are the ones that fail Project Paradise by not interacting with the event starter.
---
Are you on a private server?
---
Even if selecting it in the Atomicshop it shouldn't actually apply the skin until you completely redeploy your camp anyway which is a savior with this bug but an annoyance with the other camp skins
---
Not bitching, just annoyed. If I was really bothered by it then I'd quite the game which alot of people already have and for good reasons(It's shite)They've only done about 2 good things to the game in the history of 76.
---
Lots of people have a display case full of Nuka Cola flavors, but I almost never see people with the ones from the quest. It really surprises me, but then again I hardly see them for sale, either.
---
maybe i can bug you for another bugged quest if you have a moment, one of my ally quests is bugged as well, the girl from ally:crash landing, she wont get off of the ground because of her back. any idea?
---
also thank you so much i was so mad haha
---
Huh; ok. I'll check it out. Thanks!
---
Theres plenty of new players now especially on xbox who need a wide variety of common plans.
---
I sell all spare plans I already know for 50 caps no matter the rarity, if I have 16+ of them for some reason I sell them at 5 caps, recipes too for 5.
---
And their always rotating out no matter the rarity.
---
Usually I'll wait to add common plans to the machine after all the more interesting stuff has been added, whatever space is left will go to the more common items.
---
If I'm hurting for stash space I set aside a little spot in my vender room where I'll drop stuff like food, drink, chems, ammo and excessively excess plans where peeps can pick through them for what they can use.  Usually their gone when I come back from questing. 
---
I even keep at least 2 marsupial serums for sale at 50 caps at all times just in case a lower level player stops by who still needs them.
---
I dont stock more than 2 because some higher level player will just buy them out to flip them otherwise. 
---
Also sell my spare legendaries for 100 a star no matter the rarity. 
---
Even sold a fixer plan the other day for just 50.
---
Peeps gotta work to get to my machines as part of my silent hill camp experience so I ensure I got a great spread of useful items for cheap for their efforts.
---
Unless you are going to be modding a lot of weapons &amp; armor then there is pretty much no point in holding on to that many, I'd sell most of those &amp; just keep about 100 just in case.
---
You said if they have a full display of them there isn't an issue, but you can still have a full display when you've never picked up a bobblehead which is the only way it counts
---
I have been corrected. Thank you to those who corrected me, instead of just being like ‚Äúlook at this fucking idiot *downvote* lmao.‚Äù
---
Just reload lol.
---
I would love a skin for the Fixer that makes it look like a normal combat rifle.
---
I'd ALSO love a skin for the combat rifle and Fixer that makes it match the Service Award Fire Axe Skin.
---
You just found her? Did you give her a stimpak? Has she sent you on a quest? There are 2 or 3 missions with her in the bunker and the rest occur when you build her console at your camp - where are you on this?
---
Ill try and remember to chuck a Nuka Scorched in for the collectors then
---
put many many turrets in the workshop if you want to keep it, otherwise, claim it from the edge so you can run
---
Don't forget the can traps too.
---
Those I get for free, sure. Just not gonna spend money on something I lost because of a couple of bugs.
---
Could be like the new food/drink changes: tap A to enter quickly, hold A to enter casually
---
You can get a lot done with the basic camp plans. What is really only available from the atom store all all the little Knick knacks that make a room look loved in.
---
I agree. That said, they have to make money some time. 
---
Overall this is one of the many reasons I think seasons are a bad thing for this game.
---
i'm currently sitting on 1636. Fallout 1st FTW!
---
try diff prices for them. I've seen people selling them for 20 and i've seen people selling them for 3
---
If you Nuked White Springs, everything gets killed by the Nuke, you need to wait about 15 minutes for things to start respawning.
---
Once the enemies begin to respawn, you can have someone on your team periodically Dashboard and reload to trigger the respawn again.
---
Do you have the scrap box?
---
If not sell them.
---
You are getting downvoted for wanting a sense of achievement apparently. People are weird...
---
sorry for lack of detail, i gave her the stim pack and im at the part where she should just willingly come back to my camp, i did her missions for her and she just wont like say anything aside from her back hurts but i did give her the stim pack and run her quests. i think this ones a little more common of a bug?
---
Nothing.  
---
Because your refund is in Atoms, not in dollars..  
---
Untested crap is still enough to get you to keep injecting funds. There is an "opportunity cost" because sure, you *might* have bought both this item and then another later. But that's offset by the fact that you're more likely to spend Atoms you already have sitting there waiting to be spent.
---
Refunded Atoms is still money in their pocket.  
---
Buggy untested crap still makes a net profit.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Could I join you if he accepts?
---
Yeesh..Feel better brother, my aunt got it, it was rough, but she eventually got better. Still outta breath but better.
---
Did you talk to her?
---
Idk role playing and enjoying Fallout as the RPG it should be
---
Ooh that is nice to know. I can't finish those badge quests. I did all the ones I can. Wish they would make more. Expand that quest line a little bit more. Thanks again.
---
My opinion: the best looking camps only use the pre-fabs as accents, but if you like the modular style of blueprinting specific function buildings, it certainly makes things simpler. They just don‚Äôt allow for the same palette of creativity.
---
Plus the gold for the helmet
---
Recording it, submitting it and following up is at least something. Beats letting them blatantly cheat.
---
You could always side with the good guys who regularly slaughter people to take their stuff rather than the evil woman who sacrificed herself to save a vault full of people.
---
You posted this exact same thing 3 days ago. 
---
Submit a ticket.
---
This makes absolutely no sense. Well first part, second part is fine.  We aren't some random ass NPCs, we are all roommates/neighbors that partied too hard together and missed the Reclamantion day ceremony.
---
What DOES make sense is that a ton of America's best and brightest, indoctrinated  by Vault-Tec, would try and work together to reshape the wasteland.   You don't go full savage, you never go full savage.
---
If we could pick between say several different origin types, then yeah I would totally agree with you.   But we don't.
---
So did you build her console at your camp? What does the mission text say it‚Äôs expecting you to do next?
---
Don't worry about how others play the game, just make your own fun.
---
Your aspirations sure are high
---
Wha-? I asked what entitlement has to do with working hard, not what kinds of investments there are nor the appeal of the battle pass.
---
Huh..I dig this.
---
I‚Äôve had this bug and reloading works
---
Build one style. Then a few months later burn it to the ground and go with a completely different style. When ever you can't choose just go with one till you get bored looking at it or are inspired to do it differently.
---
So go with the train car idea. Then when the contemporary bundle comes back you can rebuild it all using that.
---
Level 19? What are you doing near the sbq lol. Slow down and enjoy the ride.
---
To be clear it doesn't take it off the top max possible, just off how much you have left (obviously small as a bloodied build)?
---
Hell why not add in a I win button that just give u all items then deletes the game for you since you are done
---
You get 1000 scrip and you turn it in, there's not really complaints about that. People complain about the daily turn in, which is 150. This is seperate from that amount
---
Fair enough man
---
At least you get something. Half the time I damage a legendary mob and can't loot it.
---
I built my camp in a random assault event, always something interesting going on when I spawn in. 
---
Is a great bonus source of rep, cryptids, stimpacks, legendaries, etc.
---
Ny camp takes a  beating from time to time especially if any of them have mini guns but it's worth it.
---
Had alot of daily challenges completed easily thanks to the wide variety of legendary cryptids that spawn through it.
---
Especially fun when they double up, seen sheepsquatch and mothmen at the same time before.  
---
Never know what's gonna be there when I fast travel back after some questing.   ^ o^
---
I just smoked a bowl so I think I‚Äôm good
---
Oh I didn't know about that! That sounds much better then
---
It doesnt.
---
People always want the easier way
---
Look if you dont get to rank 100 then fine...im at 66 thru teams friends and just playing the game
---
 
---
Apparently that makes me "entitled" when i see level 20s with a Captain Cosmos PA and a camp with every duped item they can have.
---
Seeing level 20s with Explosive Gat Plasmas
---
Yea...makes *me* entitled
---
I mean it kind of does for events like project paradise that are near impossible to solo.
---
You‚Äôre not alone, I was experiencing serious lag today that was definitely out of the norm.
---
Screws are always the thing I'm missing when workbench fixing or modding. Keep em, and if you get bored or need money make low level armour and sell sell sell.
---
Teabagging*
---
It‚Äôs funny cause I coulda sworn bethesda said they fixed this crap last year where this wouldn‚Äôt happen. They obviously lied or it didn‚Äôt work or I simply don‚Äôt remember reading the patch notes correctly since they were doing so many bug fixes last year to keep the game somewhat running.
---
I would rather they prolong the season and just give bonus crates to each time someone gets the score points equal to the final one.  I feel stressed to get these done - be it I‚Äôm only level 33 - but still sucks that it feels like you have to play daily and focus on these instead of playing the game as you want.  ESO did the same thing and was a reason I got burnt out on that game.
---
A while ago there was a light up version in the atomic shop. I think it was vaulted though.
---
Exactly. Bethesda already has their money from them buying Atoms. Giving them the Atoms back doesn't cost them a thing.
---
Junkies SS is the ONLY melee I use...got tired of doing the burial quest and no shovel to be found
---
Is your IGN the same as Reddit so I know who to accept?
---
No, I'm on Xbox and I just had a similar experience. 7/10 auto-completed for me, lost 3,5000 SCORE.
---
That's sad.
---
The miners don't really do anything different other than become glowing. you are better off to get all of WS leaving the Station clear
---
Give some to lowbies.  Under 30s usually desperately need screwing.
---
Doesn't seem like you actually wanted any help.
---
Skyrim made your high end rig overheat.  For me, Pac-Man crashes my Alienware so no big deal.
---
Got mine from powering up one of the Nuclear plants (posiden energy plant?) Near the start of my gameplay. Not sure about SBQ reward
---
Definitely a good shot!
---
The option is cool because of the heavier grind towards the end. Right now everyone should be grinding the xp repeatable.
---
but when someone buys all 100 ranks (there was a post earlier today from someone who did it) and then wants to act like they did something...and brag online and ppl are like "whoa awesome skins/camp" etc  but its all paid for...thats weak
---
i had some people doing the same on me in the SBQ sneaking and humping on me from behind but fortunately never lost something.
---
Good point
---
currently it says return to commander daguerre, i did all the signals and what not already
---
Camp budget seriously needs and increase and displayed items shouldn‚Äôt really take up budget. I already built the display AND the item is taking up my stash space, so you wanna kick me where it hurts most by taking up a load of camp budget?? It‚Äôs ridiculous! 
---
I‚Äôd also like to point out to many First users that they STILL haven‚Äôt fulfilled their promise for increased camp build area and increased budget for your private servers.
---
Most effective might just be some really basic player report system that would get suspected cheaters glanced at in real time by a moderator. You can tell the difference between "wow, maybe they're just really good" and "wow, they are very aware it doesn't matter how blatant they hack and exploit".   
---
Most matches it isn't an issue, but one or two clowns can ruin a bunch of matches for a bunch of people over a pretty short period. Which just  amplifies the "hacker haven" reputation NW has.
---
You can tell just by looking. If it‚Äôs locked it will say so and you cannot see the contents in the loot window. If you can see any purified water you should be able to take it freely.
---
Is the screen a little yellow by any chance? Because that sometimes happen when i tab out, and then i need to restart the game for it to go away.
---
You know you can park a power armor frame in the doorways of the room where one of the scavengers is hanging out, right? Blocks the ghouls from breaking through. Coulda saved you a few thousand rounds of ammo.
---
How can you grind it? Like how can you get extra SCORE other than the dailies and weeklies?
---
Decontamination shower is a guaranteed drop the first time you kill the queen and get credit. Learning it will make it so it never drops again, so if you hold off on learning it, you can farm multiple plans. Got about 30 of them sitting on a mule after leveling it and forgetting to learn it.
---
If you don't enjoy it, then no, it's absolutely better to idle in a bush somewhere.
---
More skins would be nice
---
Sometimes it seems that the no-camp zone from Fallout 1st tents remained on the server even if the tent was removed.
---
Ok it sounds like you finished a mission and she‚Äôs complaining about her back and not giving you a new mission. I don‚Äôt have a solution. If this happened to me I‚Äôd dashboard exit the game and try again and if it‚Äôs still doing that it‚Äôs support ticket time. Then I‚Äôd do the Beckett quests instead. Good luck.
---
I get three stars quite often, but it's meaningless. Recently I got a ghoul slayer's lead pipe with 50 percent limb damage and 90 percent reduced weight. Pure garbage. I have gotten two star weapons that are 100 times better.
---
Hold up im going for a 2nd
---
Yup.
---
I sell about 1000 at a time at 3 per and they sell very fast
---
thank you for all your help bud :)
---
\\
---
It seems pretty rare on vendors.  It's easy enough to just pick them up as you play.  I sell 80 off whenever I hit 100.
---
I only get any even half descent weapons from trading, have had 1 good drop in my entire lifetime on this game, a Je15 handmade and I got scammed for it cause it was my first trade ever üòÇ I still kick myself
---
I‚Äôm lvl 58 and decided to give it a shot. Went in not knowing anything. There was one other guy who was lvl 36 and I decided the hell with it, I‚Äôll give it a shot. Well, I thought it was awesome and hilarious and a ton of fun but we failed it miserably. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing because I was too busy trying to keep from dying when I slowly ran out of ammo on each of my rifles....but man, what a rush. I don‚Äôt really have the greatest weapons yet (I do have the lvl 45 excavator) so I was in WAY over my head, but I‚Äôll definitely give a shot again when I‚Äôve leveled up a bit more and have some better guns lol
---
Have you checked the list in challenges? There should be 17 in total and it will tell you which, if any, are missing.
---
Yup, The_horseman88
---
Why do people always try to act as if there can only be absolutes as in either be forced to load onto a server where your camp can't be placed or not be able to join such server at all. They could simply add the choice you get when you yourself load into the world in the mainmenu already. Click "Play", get notification "Your camp couldn't be placed. You still want to load into this world or search for another?"....and IF you want to join your friend and you get that question simply confirm and load into that server anyway! Why is that so hard for people to grasp?
---
This happened to me twice!...did the same thing looked for it forever then gave up...my last one was a suppressors fixer...=[
---
Hey! It's speared to the wall at Seneca. (Side facing the railway)
---
I do not know what it is, it looks like some kind of mutated bird, or how it got up there.
---
I had a lot of crashes on ps4 until I added a external ssd drive now I get maybe 3-4 a week
---
Just since no one's given you the detailed steps yet:
---
* Return to the Whitespring Congressional Bunker. Make your way to the General's area.  
---
* In the room with the info posters and the partial codewords, look for the surveillance terminal.  
---
* Use the terminal to look for a key card escort. This will give you the "Hide and Seek and Destroy" quest.  
---
* Follow the quest marker to a trio of vertibots and a cargo drone. Shoot down the cargo drone, lockpick the container it drops, voila: fresh key card.
---
NOTE: You can repeat the quest to stock up on key cards. They also sell fairly well in player vendors. I usually list them for 100 caps.
---
I sell all my ammo for 1 cap, always. Doesn't matter what kind.
---
At least you can invite people to yours =0
---
When i try it either straight up says 'no' despite us being xbox friends for years. or it lets them in for 10 seconds then kicks them out
---
Oh he‚Äôs just following you but playing dead as soon as you turn around. Completely normal mate
---
I don‚Äôt mess with skins. that shit ‚Äúare u sure U want to drop or ur gun will disappear forever‚Äù message gives me so much anxiety
---
I try to be understanding if someone one shots it because I know mistakes can happen. Just part of the game. But I just did Uranium Fever and these kick ass dudes did the emote THREE times and were careful not to one shot so me and some other low levels could tag it. Walked away with 3 new legendary weapons! Never seen 3 legendaries spawn at one Uranium Fever event so that was awesome!
---
My headcaonon is that the nukes are neutron bombs, which have a low explosion yield but high radiation
---
I'm only level 57 myself but I usually check around the Wayward to see if there's anyone under level 8 and give them a goodie bag of:
---
‚Ä¢ 10 stimpacks
---
‚Ä¢ 10 radaways
---
‚Ä¢ 5 rad-x
---
‚Ä¢ 10 purified waters
---
‚Ä¢ 5 cranberry cobblers (because it makes me feel like this mad, post-apocalyptic baking granny)
---
‚Ä¢ a level 10 hunting rifle with various mods
---
‚Ä¢ around 150 x .50cal ammo
---
I had a level 200 come charging up to me when I was only level 8 and trying to build my first (bad, very bad) camp and I was crapping myself until they dropped a similar goodie bag.
---
It just feels good to pass it along, y'know?
---
Not crashing as much as previously but the fast travel bug is getting worse.
---
Is the fixer by default lvl 30? I finished the quest for it at lvl 70ish
---
I‚Äôve seen that happen as well on my private server! Sometimes a friend joins and he runs around for a few seconds and boots him to main menu!
---
Wait for a SBQ.  If it goes quickly hop over and start Encrypted.  Generally people able to murder SBQ can handle Encrypted.
---
Those are rookie numbers, gotta pump them up.
---
Considering the most ammo you could have in a stash is 800k 5mm you can bet its been glitched. 
---
If they've not been duping, and let's admit they almost certainly have, it does at least show dedication, and perhaps a little OCD.
---
Great lie to tell myself thanks
---
Alot of people I played with were banned.   Some deserved it others mot so much.  Not sure if alot of them will return
---
Agreed there should be more mods that make othere builds use able besides the same old bloody they should have instant based dungeons where you can Q for so can get differnt items and skill cards in different dungeons
---
I don‚Äôt remember what level The Fixer from the taxidermy quest line was. I have purchased higher level Fixers from player vendors, though.
---
They won't. It's actually on the submission page that they can't reimburse SCORE. What they should probably do is just give everyone a bunch of atoms instead.
---
And that is a VERY useful goodie bag for someone lower level.
---
It's future-tec https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hv2vkr/psa_dont_use_the_new_futuretec_camp_unit_you_get/
---
But thanks for the reminder.
---
Yes its not like the game didnt featured destruction, just look at what a scorchbeast can do to tour camp
---
Is there a good strategy to avoid this problem. Perhaps a YouTube video are a Reddit link you know? Or do I just roll with it as I have been.
---
Send a wire, main office, tell them I said **OW**
---
I mean they‚Äôve never really definitively said what type of warheads are on the missiles, it‚Äôs not necessarily a lie. Schrodinger‚Äôs Nuke.
---
Look around for a while and youll find out why ;)
---
I placed my camp close to them before, people would be weirded out where all the screaming was coming from. Had to move eventually cause it became a lil annoying for myself haahha
---
Add another disconnect
---
Everyone grinding for this crap makes me sad.
---
Log into your Microsoft account on a computer and look at subscriptions there.
---
Hunt down another cargobot. I‚Äôm pretty sure the enclave, or modus can mark it for you when you go into the bunker in the military wing, upstairs or downstairs
---
I'm glad you think so! I was wondering if it was overkill but I was just giving things that I would have loved to get when I was their level.
---
Which BOS one?
---
Get FO1st for a month then store lean, screws etc
---
Man I still think I have way too much to do in a session with 4 characters and 2000 hours. Maybe you get bored easily?
---
All the common plans sell in my experience. I sell some most play sessions, including mounted heads for 5 caps each.
---
But you're right, just let everyone play how they want. Want to sell a mounted cat head for 30k caps?  Ok. Want to put on a chef's outfit and run around with a legendary rolling pin?  Cool.
---
I'm just now level 44.  About level 39, after learning the Nukashine, I got drunk and started playing a session.
---
The next morning, I wake up in what I now know is the Cranberry Bog.  Only one map marker known.   My head pounding, I'm confused.   I see overpowered Scorch near me, try to fast travel and wait for the countdown.   At 3 seconds, that damn Scorchedbeast sees me, and i die.   
---
Spawn at camp.  Turns out I'm short a few Nukashine, and several thousand caps.  No clue what I did the night before, but damn it was an experience.  Drunk me had drunk fun on some Nukashine.
---
Agree to disagree. Been playing since beta and I've got legacy legendaries that I no longer used because I got bored with being an over powered juggernaut.  I personally dont need the game to be easier but take serious beef with the RNG percentages. It's been months since I've seen anything but one stars from the SBQ and I hit her typically 3 or more times a week. Perhaps you are just luckier than others. I still think higher star enemies should have a much great chance at dropping higher star loot and not just the ludicrous slim percentage that they seem to have now.
---
I dropped 3 nukes today, killed the imposter once and finished radiation rumble twice and not one weapon or piece of armor I can get excited about. It will all be scrapped tomorrow.
---
God I love when that happens. Had it only happen once to me before because two nukes were dropped and I outlived everyone who was in the nuke zone
---
I guess, im no expert in nuclear weapons but aren't the missiles in the silos a little too big for a neutron bomb ?

This! I‚Äôd honestly prefer instead of junk found, I‚Äôd like to see scrap yield increased. Meaning same amount of junk items but more scrap from those items.
---
What platform do you play on? Also what‚Äôs his tag
---
I have had the the problem once. Last Monday, my network connection dropped as I was logging on, after the reset, and all of the challenges that I had done the previous day where auto completed.
---
In this case it was not actually auto completing the challenges but actually not resetting the challenges.
---
I think what is happening the first time you load into a world after the reset the server sends the new set of challenges and clears the completed state of the challenges. If the message is not received or not properly processed you are out of luck for that days challenges.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you, I have no knowledge really. Maybe their bombs are more efficient and smaller?

ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Truly
---
Love it. I kill a SB miles away or in a nuke zone I don‚Äôt feel like gearing up to go into and it meets me at the next station. Often only travels when it has loot so I empty it‚Äôs corpse and it stops. 
---
I‚Äôve also heard of others being able to fill it with heavy things and travel using it as a temporary storage
---
Yeah, why test things before you release them? Pfff, QA, Shmu A.
---
At this point I don't know if it's arrogance, incompetence, carelessness, or stupidity, but Bethesda just cannot seem to be able to learn their lesson. Just once it'd be nice if they released an update that didn't break something, introduce a new duping bug, or otherwise break the game.
---
Pole hook.
---
I noticed that too and the dark matter skin I believe just doesn‚Äôt work. Or they forgot to load in the right one? Personally I think it‚Äôs just really bad work and they need to up their standards to what they release. Improve your quality of work bethesda! You make legendary games with legendary amounts of bugs in them! Make a new game engine that works and isn‚Äôt aging horribly!
---
Like I told someone else, my only suggestion would be to do diluted radaway and stimpaks though, just because that low level, your health is low enough that, to me, using full strength ones feel like a waste. And at that level diluting your own is kind difficult.
---
But, I'm very much that guy that will saves all his stealth boys because I might need them later, right up until the end of the game where I realize I never used any of them.
---
If they do they they need to make legendary enemies more rare. Doing a normal run through the map and I‚Äôll hit 3-5 legendaries in an hour (more if I do certain events). That‚Äôs absurd. At a point hey are not ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù anymore, they are just common.
---
Ye,I had the same thing goin on my wife‚Äôs card,

We actually ended up just switching out the cards,as they kept attempting too charge even after we ended our sub.

Best of luck yo

Spoilers for the next patch: I don‚Äôt think you can confront Penelope directly, but you can tell Earle Willams daughter that Penelope is in foundation since she‚Äôs responsible for him being trapped in the mine. But yeah I hope they do some more with Penelope in the future.

If you get the sense of achievement from working for it then work for it, no-one else would even care if you had some rank 100 stuff without the option to buy it, sense of achievement is a personal thing, what you seem to be looking for is bragging rights
