Yup. Pervert Murmur will add it to the loot pool.
---
---
---
We live that warhammer lifestyle and dive into the fired of battles.
---
Agreed, would also love a skin for Gatling Plasma and Gatling laser.
---
Those weapons are never transferable
---
Ive reached the point where whenever anyone asks for new weapons my mind immediately says so my odds of the weapon i want will be slightly lower and i think im ok with that
---
Everyone I play with is finished and has been for the passed few weeks. Sorry for sharing? I didnt know there were still people grinding after the double xp weekend. Using the lunchboxes on that weekend made it possible to finish one half of the entire run in two days... it's a thing that happened and it was something plenty of people caught wind of. I helped three new players go from level 20 to over level 120. 
---

---
Just a couple days with no glitching or cheats, just taking over all the workshops and going to the events... having 15 CHR gives you 75% xp when you complete events, lunch boxes give you 100% xp, then the double xp factor of that weekend......... maybe not half of the community finished,  but those that knew about how to use mentats, scorhbeast brains, and all the other things I mentioned...  we finished in a couple weeks. I haven't played for weeks. I've been waiting for meat week!
---
Having used regular and power armor, I feel way to squishy in regular armor, especially to rads.
---
I'm a huge fallout fan but even I only played for the first month and had enough, it was a complete mess almost unplayable and not much to do in the moments it was working , then exactly a year later I came back and saw lot of improvements and today it's only got better, how it should have been day 1, the game has come a long way.
---
One is an ore and one isn’t
---
They've said, repeatedly now, that all seasons will be free.
---
You know what something weird happened the other day. I made a new character and got them a bow and some bow skills, and they were doing 125 damage with every sneak attack headshot. But every once in awhile, the sneak headshot with the bow would only do 25 damage and their healthbar wouldn’t move. Something odd is going on.
---
(Also explosive weapons are shite sadly, that might also be the reason why. Lots of stuff has explosive resistance.)
---
I still have an Ultracite leg with a jetpack
---
(pts spoilers obviously) You can get a plan from the daily ops to build a vita chamber?(I think that's the name or maybe that's from bioshock) In your camp that clear your disease.
---
Other items you can get are bubble turrets and signs from the burrows, valley galleria and other daily ops locations. Pretty awesome actually.
---
Neat :) 
---
Yes, will return to the samaritan style.
---
Dude this game is awesome solo! I exclusively play solo. You can team up just to complete dailies real quick and leave, no need to team up for any event outside of that. Get lone wanderer asap.
---
Pretty sure its Perveyor
---
Nothing in terms of Caps or trades really.
---
Just valuable as Scrip.
---
What?
---
I don't think you know what 2 factor authentication means.
---
I love the idea... But let’s take this one step at a time eh? Let’s make sure the mannequins actually work first before asking for more features for them, make sure they don’t eat our clothes or people can steal off them or something eh?
---
I'm thinking a chariot using the free states trailer pulled by slaves. White slaves of course, I am not racist.
---
Thanks for your help!
---
Thanks was looking for one
---
Nothing. By the time you might want an alternate full suite of troubleshooter things (perhaps to take on robot heavy quests like the silos) you’ll be over level 50.
---
Yes, I got a 1 star zealots from the meat cook.
---
[removed]
---
That is a great idea, I got a another suggestion, They should give more features to the My Personal Terminal like private messages or something
---
You already have the recipes. You need to collect the right glowing plants. You could Google it, but there are also notes in the military wing of the enclave that tell you which plants to collect for the various flux.
---
The much harder grind than plants, especially since hardly anyone nukes Whitespring anymore and SBQ fights are quick and thankfully outside of the nuke zones, is collecting the hardened mass, glowing mass, and high rad fluids.
---
For what Dungeons, exactly?
---
"If I am gunna whore myself out regularly, then I better get some penicillin."
---
-OP-
---
There are motorcycles lying around, a few steel, gears, screws, and nuclear material....we could go out for a rip.
---
I play on PC.
---
I think they should be banned for using external means to bypass the idle disconnect. Cheaters don't get brownie points for sharing their ill-gotten gains.

---
Are we assuming they wouldn't have armed themselves before they left?
---
While you can expect some small amount of resource loss in the trip, I doubt the contingent is big enough that they would abandon their gear in favor of picking up and hauling around 25 - 30 different kinds of weapons with different ammunition requirements. 
---
This is a military unit and military units rely on uniformity. They would not have embarked sans proper equipment, and they certainly wouldn't abandon familiar equipment on their journey. 
---
From a lore perspective it does not make sense for the BOS to introduce 30+ weapons to Appalachia upon their arrival, and that doesnt even factor in the logistics of designing, balancing and animating all of them, AND hoping all of the mods function correctly on top of introducing new ammo types to the game (which would come with its own additional baggage of integration with the existing crafting and refurbishing systems).
---
I have a decent bloodied combat shotgun if you want it I could sell it to you.
---
Silos aren't much of a problem because I have my 2 friends to back me up was looking for one because I like the deathclaw gauntlet as a weapon
---
Glad I camped out on a lead vein though maybe I need to hit a private server and occupy the ammo factory
---
This hasn't been the cure all as it used to be. 
---
Log on to any other game, then log on to 76. It's as if it needs to be taught how to get online again. 
---
It was told to me, it has worked multiple times for me, I've told it to others, it has worked for most of them except the last person.
---
He means the mod plans.
---
Stash limit 400 pounds, no fallout 1st, no player vending, no way to get rid of unwanted legendaries,people could pvp you anywhere using slap damage, game crashed every ten minutes (not even joking) and we liked it that way...
---
I once found a bunch of pleaseant valley claim tickets at WS station, I think there were around 70 of them. At the time I thought it was a duper who left them there but after getting everything of value from them I can see how much they accumulate when doing line in the sand and clearing white springs and now I sell em at my camp.
---
Also for future use what are some good troubleshooters
---
The firebreathers plans i think.
---
Oh hell yes that would be great!!!
---
Might be a good time for me to try for legendary tenders
---
If it’s something I don’t have all of the plans for, I might buy weapons or armor strictly for the purpose of trying to get those.
---
Yes, I got a bloodied tenderizer on the cook event.
---
Edit: https://i.gyazo.com/50129373b937381b79ec4d68385634d5.jpg
---
Great idea, never going to happen.
---
Another interesting thing would be for like junk or ammo if someone has a vending machine they can add caps to it and players who have an excess of that item can sell it to them.
---
I've just reached 95 today, after having lost 6 days worth of dailies and 3 weeklies to auto complete...
---
Some were from the game being active during the reset, 2 dailies and 2 weeklies were hours after the reset!
---
This is actually a great time, grahm at the cookout has a selection of some of the best plans and some rare ones! Just head there a couple of minutes early to talk to him.
---
Well troubleshoot simply is a prefix. It means on a weapon that it’s going to do more damage to robots. On armor it’s going to protect you from robot damage. 
---
A troubleshooter leather armor set fully fixed up probably (don’t hold the math against me) would probably do someone quite well against robots.
---
There is a disease cure water fountain under a gazebo in the Whitesprings Golf area. I go there every time I have a disease.
---
Good amount of BoS items datamined. Most outfits, skins, PA skins, etc. Then there's the bunker in Season 2 at like rank 80
---
But, no doubt more stuff will come as the BoS have two content drops
---
No word on the Enclave yet, only thing we've seen was the eyepatch that rereleased, and the unreleased prototype X02
---
If i visit a camp and I see legendary weapons or armor regardless what level or stars, if it’s cheap I’ll sell it for script. Sometimes I’m at max caps, or I’m low on script.  So why not. 
---
If you’re selling it, and I want it, I’ll buy it. If you don’t want high level players to take it, then carry it on you, walk up to a low level and try to sell it right there and then to him/her. 
---
I don’t know what your prices are, but if you’re selling it to a low level, what’s “cheap” for you, might not be cheap for them. Meanwhile a 3 digit player will obviously have the caps to buy it. 
---
When I put stuff for sale in my camp I don’t give a damn who buys it. I don’t care if it’s for script, for their friend, or for them to put it in their vendor for 3 times the money. What they chose to do with it, is what they want. 
---
I get you’re trying to be a “nice guy” and I’m sure you might’ve helped out a low level or two. But again, there’s no way for you to prevent high level players from taking it, so unfortunately in this case there’s nothing you can do but deal with it.
---
I'm pretty sure it's Delbert's recipes, I've had the same issue before, the Misc items I had disappeared after I sold the recipes
---
For me, it is PA in nuke zones and colossal problem and SS everywhere else.  I stay out of PA as much as possible to retain my unyielding stats buffs.
---
I've been trying for 2 months to get a bloodied Plasma Caster... No luck yet. I've gotten a vampires reduced weight one 6 times.... On different days!
---
Tbh, I initially wanted to build something along the lines of a "suicide bomber" and just run in killing things with grenades, mines, mini-nukes, missiles, and so forth at point blank range.
---
IIRC, dense is supposed to reduce explosive damage by 50%, whereas a level 3 fireproof does 45%. Yeah, you can have cars blow up in your face and take no damage but my own explosives would typically kill me. 
---
As for shotguns, I think the damage might be due to latency and such(kinda how the damage might rubberband) or how weapons can't hit even with 95% chance in VATS.
---
But I get you on how some quite a few people will always call certain things "trash". From what I've noticed, it's typically the "sheep" who only use meta builds/weapons and don't bother to try and figure things out for themselves.
---
I love flying from one side of the map to the other with the jetpack. Best way to see Appalachia
---
Edit: [for context](https://youtu.be/nbYemhMfq3E)
---
I never bulk my junk to sell it. I just sell it "loose" so as not to waste plastic. You can factor what each item should cost by determining the price you want to sell for a bulked item, then dividing it by how many of those items are in a bulked bundle. If you end up with a decimal, I just round up to the nearest whole number, which helps cover the 10% loss from your vendor tax. Certain items sell really well, and I usually mark those up by a few caps just because the demand is high. Adhesive, steel, lead, acid, screws, gears, springs, and oil are the ones I usually mark up.
---
Knowing Bethesda Mannequins, they will just up and wander around for the time when the game is loading in your camp every time someone visits it!
---
Can we sticky this? Literally every single day there’s a dozen people creating threads within an hour of daily reset shocked that they had auto completed challenges, it’s like clockwork.
---
A sequinned Michael Jackson glove skin for the power fist. Run around punching stuff yelling Shamone Hee Hee.. but seriously the more skins  the better, for all weapons.
---
\*facepalm\*
---
Much appreciated, recently hit +50 and started to run into upgrades that needed flux.
---
Sold? I make and upgrade power armor for people lower then lvl 50 and give it to them for free?
---
No humans, but the robots and holotapes basically filled all those roles. I personally don't feel any different running up to ward for my daily task than I did getting a "prerecorded" message about a scorched flash warning or listening to the census violence robot prattle on before finally starting the event. That's probably the biggest NPC-related change for me in wastelanders - the ability to have dialogue boxes, meaning you can skip his talking instead of waiting for I think over a minute of speech. Then you had characters like Rose that were pretty much just stretching a technicality. She clearly has the personality of a human, acts like a human, but needs to have a few "hey look at me I said a quirky robot thing, I'm a robot remember?" in her lines just to give us a reminder.
---
The game as a whole was just more broken and more over the place. It's definitely stabilized compared to then, but much of it is still just glossed over. There were many things that people benefited from that led to some crazy moments. I'm sure you know that TSE used to be hilariously overpowered, much more than bloodied/unyielding is right now. The meta back then was jumping around with marsupial and one-shotting everything with your TSE pump action shotgun. I remember trading for one just to see what the fuss was about. Full health, no drugs, only bloody mess and shotgun/explosive damage perks, I reached around 1600 pip boy damage. Sold it to somebody else after 30 minutes of play time, it got boring one-shotting everything very quickly.
---
Many features you take for granted now were simply not there yet. Player vending didn't exist until the middle of last year. Same with the purveyor. Before either of these, you would collect all your legendaries, sell the junk ones to robo vendors for a few caps, and look through third parties to see if anybody wanted to buy the remaining ones. "World" events like encryptid, heart of the swamp, etc. didn't exist, you got no notifications for anything other than scorched earth. No free fast travel to any events, either. Many more smaller things were just broken or didn't work at all. Vendors used to just sell a batch of random plans, which were not labeled with a (known) tag, so you had to remember which ones you knew and keep server hopping to find the ones you needed. Also, some plans were level locked, so for example you couldn't buy handmade rifle plans unless you were a very low level character in the mire/bog. Until fairly recently, scorchbeasts could never be legendary, so they all felt extremely underwhelming to fight, and the queen's loot pool has received multiple additions from its original state as well. Some items, like I think treated raider lining(?) were missing from their pools, making the rest of the progression impossible.
---
Some other things were also really beneficial that ended up getting nerfed or removed. White knight and similar perks used to be more effective, they eventually both nerfed the effectiveness of those perks and raised the repair costs of higher leveled gear. Bloated glowing ghouls used to be bugged to give boss exp, so you'd get pretty much the same exp from killing one as from killing a scorchbeast. People would farm nuked whitesprings for days on end and I believe no better exp farm has yet been implemented that does not involve cheating. You could stack some bobbleheads infinitely, so people used hundreds of duped explosive bobbleheads on their TSE shotguns to achieve 6-digit damage (this was of course before damage numbers came as a feature). No-star legendaries used to be a bug for about a year, which would get you a lot more crappy 1* legendaries than you find nowadays. Fun fact, this bug is still in the game, they just forcefully remove the "legendary" and the star from its name. Melee weapons used to benefit from a bug that raised their damage when they were repaired above 100% condition, which made rippers/chainsaws/drills actually viable without a min-maxed build. There more generic exploits or oversights that allowed you to farm things easier, like I remember there used to be a way people made thousands of caps in a single run with cap stashes, and then they were changed to counter that.
---
Everything else is as you would expect. More bugs, game crashes and disconnects were far more common, worse performance. A bit less content. Although one thing to note is back then we used to get updates far more frequently. It used to be 2 or 3 per month, with hotfixes for really bad stuff, now it's once every 5 or 6 weeks and half the time we need to wait for the next update if a new bug is anything short of game-breaking.
---
Yes but all of my junk is bulked and I’m technically over flowing with junk. So I’m technically only selling a quarter of everything I own.

Or a quest where you and you team have to deliver something in pvp mode with no fast travel.
---
Stuff in vendors is for sale. You have no control who buys it. If you want to help low levels, find them on the map. Give them stuff. My lowest level character is level 110 and I buy all cheap legendaries for scrip, I have no idea what your intentions for selling them are. And I take all free ammo, not to keep (I only use 5.56 and .45) but to give away to low levels....🤔
---
I'm just thinking, like you get the mannequins dressed up and put in a pose and as you go to leave you c.a.m.p you see out of the corner of your eye it start to move.
---
Not really and not yet. In the near future Daily ops will be implemented (currently in Fo76 PTS for PC for testing). These are the closest feature to dungeons. Also coming with daily ops is a new public team option that will be used for pairing up with other players who want to do daily ops. 
---
Public Team — Teams have a Team Goal, like exploration or building, Daily ops which will help you find other like-minded players more easily. Public Teams can have up to four members. Benefits are tied to the number of players in the team. Example 1 member x1 boost, 2 members x2 boost, up to x4 boost. 
---
Daily Ops — Put your skills to the test by taking on instanced, randomized, and repeatable encounters called “Daily Ops.” Enemies in Daily Ops will feature unique “mutations” that may require you to strategize how best to take them out. The name of the game is speed. The goal is not only clear the objective but do it as fast as possible. Not a traditional dungeon experience. 
---
Also worth noting if you're a newish player, these Daily ops won't be available for awhile. They are meant for lvl 50+.
---
Marsupial + Bird Bones + Speed Demon + Jetpack + Bicycle = Profit
---
If you are on PS4 I will buy all your oil...
---
It's better because there are objectives you can AFK at and still contribute but AFKing in general is still looked down upon.
---
I've seen the same players (maybe 1 player and their alts) playing the barrels for several hours yesterday.
---
It takes a bit I’ve turned in 300+ and I only got the plans for the paints in groups
---
This means I should still sell the ones I find as Breach and Clear is one of my favorite events.
---
Xbox my dude
---
Yeah its pretty fucking stupid.
---
I use the Inventor's skin on my JE laser rifle
---
Which is commendable, but impractical. Unless you're willing to stand in your camp and yank the stimpacks from your vendor when a higher level player approaches, you can't really enforce this. Just handing the stimpacks out to low players would be a better option, and you get to see their response, which is always fun. I'll be honest, if I came across a camp with stims for 1 cap, I'm buying every single one of them.
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
You are not alone.
---
We can't even get double-sided walls, I think you're asking for too much chief
---
Leather Coat and Travelling Leather Coat are rare drops ... So rare that I've just seen someone wearing one and got excited about it ... I've got more than 2800 hours in the game and been wanting that coat. Mire events can drop as stated.
---
Its terrible. Goes on the backside of most walls and its blurry as hell. Total crap for such an accomplishment.
---
I just finished. It was pointless tbh. I wouldn't worry about finishing.
---
There's an Inventor's skin for laser rifles. It was in the Atom shop a few weeks back.
---
👋🏼 on Xbox?
---
Lever action is way rather than it should be. I spent a week checking Grafton when levelling up trying to find the plan, which according to the wiki should be widely available. No luck. Had to bite the bullet and go all the way south to the ash heap train station to find the plan. Since then I’ve only gotten ONE as a drop. Thankfully a higher level player gave me one as a gift too, which I used for ages until I finally replaced it with a Fixer.
---
I finished the run last night.  The reward for me was not having to pay attention to the dailies anymore.  I actually did what I wanted in the game today.  Most fun I’ve had in weeks.
---
Yeap
---
Scaly skin is def worth. Once you get the serums recipes they are relatively cheap to craft/use for some of the mutations with the more annoying side effects (twisted, healing, speed, grounded etc). Youll get a full hour side effect free.
---
Honestly, the best and easiest ways to get flux are to buy them here or grind SBQ events. You'll get about four random stable flux for every SBQ plus all the other goodies like improved repair kits. They seem to sell for about 100-250 caps ea here depending on the variety.
---
Or, just grind them out. That works, but plan it carefully because those unstable flux don't last long and the other ingredients are hella heavy in the stash.
---
Bigger, badder, better.
---
You seem new, so I'll elaborate
---
You cannot apply any skin to 'Ultracite' laser Rifles, they have the same Model as the Normal Laser Rifle, but have different stats and shoot Green Lasers
---
all the skins that ever came out for Laser rifles were strictly for Normal Laser Rifles, not Ultracite ones.
---
Yes. I rolled 1000 scrip after learning the plan and rolled an Anti Armor Swing Speed +1Strength Tenderizer.
---
It's in the pool after you learn it
---
Theyre so easy to make though
---
Most mutations are worth it if you take Class Freak, which reduces negative effects of mutations by up to 75%. There's another perk that increases the benefits of mutations if your teammates are also mutated. Between the two of them, it's life-changing.
---
Yes! Exactly something like that. I really love the idea of having to max out Aquaboy/girl or another niche perk card in order to reach/complete an event.
---
There is also a perk called Radicool, which gives you more strength the higher you rads. Strength directly increases melee damage, and high rads + low health synergises really well with Bloodied weapons, unyielding armor, nerd rage, serendipity, Adrenal Reaction and a bunch of others I'm probably forgetting.
---
I need a skin for the deathclaw gauntlet - as well as a pirate hook skin for the meat hook
---
I've been trying for a month to get any unyielding secret service left arm. If I get another Hunters or Ghoul Slayer, I am going to lose my mind.
---
Alright. It's a weird bug, to be certain, but the only time I've spotted so far was a run where I started to see the weird pixelation and lag that comes during Line in the Sand runs where people are spamming Teslas.
---
It seems like the probable cause, but if you didn't spot one then it must be something else.
---
Like actual money bounties or is it like caps and stuff?
---
You're a madman.
---
/s
---
Not gonna lie, If I’m vendor hopping and see dirt cheap legendaries I’ll buy them up for scrip if I haven’t cashed it out yet. Even then if it’s cheap and has reduced weight I may just buy it for scrip for tomorrow. I suppose it’s pure laziness on my part but it’s an effective cap sink for me.
---
Yes we are!!! How can i connect to your server? That would be very helpful
---
IIIIIII WANNNA ROCKN ROLL ALL NIGGGGGHHT
---
Oh yeah I was trying for unyielding secret service limbs for my unarmed character, for ages, I just gave up and kept them with combat armor limbs and just a secret service chest.
---
I just want a secret door, I’ve got a secret communist base underneath a normal looking shack and the best I’ve got is a keypad door.
---
That and some mods for shovels. Come Beth... Give us more shovel option to bury the dead... I mean ghouls with!
---
You mean legendary?
---
You do you. If you have to bulk it to manage stash space, that's cool too. And bulk junk sells just as well as loose junk. :)
---
Shame I cant give you my one. I got a god role bloodied one that does not really get used much(plz give us the ability to trade it)
---
Don’t be too sad. We’re only months away from the Halloween event at Whitesprings which is way more fun.
---
I should put a message over the vending machine saying please get this junk outta my stash I’m out of space lol
---
Look for the green spaceship on the board. That’s where the bad guy is. That’s where you should be by now. Either a few spaces behind or ahead of him. If you’re nowhere near him right now, only way for you to catch up might he pay to win.
---
There was a great glitch for that, shame they patched it! So far these reduced weight guns I've being put on display, pretending they're mounted gun turrets!
---
Indeed!
---
“This Machine kills settlers!”
---
Please beth?
---
Exactly!
---
Right after the sbq and if they're in the nuke zone I've had really good luck sprinting to forward station delta for a few glowing gouls who usually have good loot and then sprint to overgrown sundew for whatever spawns there, usually get away with a decent amount of glowing mass and hardened mass, just gotta be the first one there or atleast get some tags. But the high rad fluids is hit and miss
---
Also mining the ultracite around the fissures there spawns scorched mobs and they can drop the needed loot too
---
Yeah but the issue is that it shows I killed all the monsters and waves completed. Afterward the timer continues without awarding me prime meat.
---
lol, 407 levels of new...
---
My mistake, I've never used 'Ultracite' lasers.
---
I tried having a freebie vendor and it never works out, I dunno what someone wants 5 mr handy buzzsaw blade plans for or 10 mole miner gauntlet plans for but after the third time it wa cleared out I just find some low lvl and drop everything in their camp, or just dump it at the overseers camp or even on one of the corpses when you first leave 76.

Idk, the Postal Service in IRL America isn’t looking so great right now....

On a serious note, this could be really useful. Especially if you could “send” items off to another character, switch characters, and get those items in a camp mailbox or something.
---
14 more days of challenges so 2500 max a day plus 2 weeks of weeklies works out to what 10K more you are nearing or are at where you need more than 2500 a day. So about 55k you should move about 17 more spaces.
---
Depending on the bonus challenge week that is starting soon and how many extra challenges they give us will play a role, if I had to guess I would say 3-5 more spaces max.
---
So count up how many spaces you have left and go off that estimation.  
---
Edit: I haven't finished but I was 7 spaces behind and now am 8 ahead I started two weeks ago to grind the xp bonus. I run full broken unyielding so +30 int (62% bonus xp) Kindred spirit, 15% inspirational 25% herbivore cranberry relish brain bombs or brain soup I have a ton live and love #8 for another 5% and in a building team. I run bog circles for all the high level xp mobs on a good run I can proc it 3 times in 10-15 minutes.   
---
Also abuse the line in the sand glitch which most people do not show up for netting me 1200-1400 score each time, I pop 4 lunch boxes for that though.
---
This is how I've played all the Elder scroll and Fallout games, I always end up sticking to one character after I've tried a few first to see how things work. I have three retired characters at 50 however I can't see myself levelling any of them further until we have an account wide loot drop, so I can share stuff across characters.
---
Every time I do it it’s a stim and ammo...😐
---
This is why I'm not in a rush.  Doing my dailies each day and weeklies each week.  I didnt do any NW challenges and didnt grind for xp more than I normally would.  I even missed a week of dailies due to power outage.  Never got hit with the autocomplete.
---
I'm slated to finish tomorrow.  And I dont care.  Do I want the things?  Yes.  Am i going to kill myself for them, no.  It just so happens that I'm finishing early.
---
This happened to me too when I tried to place a preset

Id gladly take a temp ban if it means it won’t forever take up budget. After this I’m not messing with exploits ever again.
---
Pico up raw flux. That’s it
---
You guys must be camping in crazy places. I've made over 40 different camps an hardly ever get attacked.
---
Thanks
---
You can't lose your Flux to players anymore.  If you die while carrying it then it just get destroyed. This has been the case for almost a year to prevent the exact griefing you are describing. Don't carry around Flux.
---
Pretty sure it is ‘Purveyor Murmrgh’. 
---
;)
---
YES
---
Graham is at a static location this week, and he has some exclusive camp plans. You may have to server hop until you find them though.
---
Add it to the list of "Things games have had for decades that 76 Doesn't"
---
get some kool-aid as a refreshment
---
Small camps are easy to make. Easier to fill with stuff and put plenty of detail. The bigger your camp the harder to detail and make look nice. Try to have as little "empty space" as possible when decorating, you want to be able to move around and see the camp but with big empty gaps it'll look empty and I try to make smaller cabins or shacks that look like someone actually lives in it instead of a giant empty box. Level 20 there's a limit you can do since your missing alot of plans but try to stay simple and small. If anything just try to find a really nice location that you like the view and slowly build your camp and expand.
---
You do know everyone's dead, right? 
---
Yes! Every single one of them!
---
Best character in game 100%
---
Making more things account wide would solve this problem.
---
But I doubt they’ll do anything like that. Their main concern is wether you are spending money. It doesn’t matter if you’re having fun or not.
---
He makes a comment that humans need to eat plants too- between that and all the food we are rewarded are base plans so there is no need to learn the plans
---
Put a sign on your vending machine that says "for newbies only please". Most people aren't trying to be jerks, they just have no way to know what your intent is unless you have a sign. There's an extremely low chance that someone who goes to check out your vending machine will also have seen your post here before doing so, and if they did, they're not going to remember it was you. At the end of the day, you can't control who buys from your vending machine, but a sign can make a big difference.
---
also 2 at lost home

---
Less stable. No radio host. No human npc’s. You can still do all the pre-wastelanders quests. All of the quests for the responders, firebreathers, mistress of mysteries, free states, rose, etc were all pre-wastelanders. There were NPCs , they just weren’t humans. Everyone was dead who lived in Appalachia. 
---
As I said, you can still do all the pre-wastelanders quests to see what it was like.
---
Across over at Deathclaw Island, the covered bench on the northwest shore has a spawn point on the roof. That one has been there very regularly for me.
---
Like try starting out with a 2x2x1 hut and just tinker with what decorations you have and see what you can do with that.
---
I was planning on spending my atoms to go up a few spaces but I accidentally spent 800 on that stupid pink cow outfit smh.
---
Getting the power plant online can be pretty daunting. That place is a fucking maze! grats
---
Modules feel like they're different. I hoard mine and either go crazy or ply my luck surely steadily each day... it doesn't sound like the immediacy of a purveyor sale. Although the end result is the same, I agree.
---
Anyone check the radar to see where they are?
---
You can also get the recipe for Chally's Feed, which is also very not meat based.
---
What platform are you on? I’m on Xbox and will look to see if I have unstoppable 4 in the morning. Don’t want to promise I have it but I collect the mags myself and will check in the morning ☺️
---
There probs is still a glitch for it, I just wouldnt want to risk getting a ban lol
---
lol at least not with bethesda.  They are slow to react most of the time but they go honeybadger and its a pain to even communicate with them
---
Oh there is, but the newer version has a 90% chance of it being eaten by the script machine so isn't worth the effort.
---
It’s also looking for enough players for each match since meat week is happening more players are doing the events instead of playing nw
---
This is probably gonna make you really mad but I’ve made 2 BFFR plasma casters in my quest to get a good junkies one. I ended up scripping both of them
---
I saw a camp in the mire that built a large jail fence around the start barrel and all creatures spawned inside the fenced area. Turrets, rockets and players just hosed the enemies. It was all over in minutes. No hide and seek, no searching.
---
Killed me 4 times so far
---
Let me help you with the name.. It's Douchehead.
---
Shame, am making them to replace my Gattling gun, in my goal to replace all my ballistic weapons with energy ones for my heavy gunner.
---
why the facepalm?
---
The only thing I want from NV is the Tesla cannon
---
Whens the sale start?
---
So basically the songs would just play randomly then? Ehh yeah sounds like it started really rough
---
I don’t understand why they can’t just do what Borderlands 2 does where you both have to accept and there’s a 3 second countdown before the trade actually goes through
---
My big issue right now, is that the grind is all there is. I have no problem with a solid grind if there's A. Decent fun repeatability and randomization and B. A purpose to the grind, an end goal to it. Right now there's neither of those. No real raids, a sore lack of variety, and no challenge that *needs* that grind to be overcome. Those are all problems that need to be solved if 76 is going to stick around for MMO-level lengths.
---
I’ve been logged in during reset a lot, logged out a lot, never happened to me. I can’t say for sure that’s not the cause but I don’t think it is
---
I get why they don't give out atoms anymore, but I think a fair trade would be completing the Gold Star dailies would get you a lunchbox or a handful of scrap/repair kits. Just a little something something to reward you for playing after completion of the season.
---
I’ll sell those for 10 caps, all recipes are 15, it’s not about the caps for me in that case, I just now it’s cheap enough for anyone who actually wanted the plan and it’s cheap enough for me that I move through them. 
---
In all honestly I’m only selling 10-15 items I want a return on at a time, the rest is really cheap plans for anyone looking for em.
---
I always like the steak house.  One on the roof by the suitcase and one on the shelf.by the chest.
---
Only comment/suggestion is in my opinion a bit too much 'open' space on the interiors.. makes it look kinda barren.  That being said still super cool and creative.. LOVE the stair idea going up into the dome!
---
Info is always appreciated
---
I assume you just have person one put the item in the script machine and then person two just spam's the button to enter it before the item despawns lol. That is my guess anyway
---
I had a quad western revolver and it animated every single bullet instead of six then it's quadrupled.
---
Yup it was a really bumpy ride
---
Some extra steps involving murder and pretty much.
---
We should keep this feature, punish them for buying commie items.
---
If you don't shoot back there's literally nothing they could have done though
---
The harpoon gun is the heavy sniper.
---
Yeah, I’m pretty sure we all did. I did for sure. It’s just hit or miss on if it gets stuck.
---
That's stash limit is nuts, 800 already seems so low, junk should be weightless in stash... But yeah guess they gotta sell the premium stuff
---
The harpoon gun is the heavy sniper I think but it would be cool to at least get a baret 50 skin
---
I use it for the mask in monster mash, but otherwise only food and drinks regularly. My game doesnt lag much though, so it only does so on request.
---
I just want the colt 45 pistol added
---
I believe it but I checked there and didn't find. Also had to fight a bunch of scorched, supermutants and 2 scorchbeast.
---
Someone was using a gauss weapon that killed the sheepsquatch as it was spawning. I was thinking that could have done it this time. But I see it happen regularly. I was hoping someone knew a trick to fix it. We tried using the drum again. Nothing.
---
I only use it for any loose plans I find.
---
I did a few solo today in the bog and had no issues. I also know the spawn points and wait for them there.
---
A lot of people who are into the camp building aspect of the game, don’t always put it in an easy to find spot, myself included. I don’t intentionally make it hard to find or anything. I just prioritize placing it where it makes sense in regards to the overall camp design that I have in mind,  over where it might be obvious.
---
How do you play the game if it lags that bad? Seems like you have bigger problems.
---
Sounds fun lol
---
That's where having the accountants in charge hurts both the game and the profits. If we don't have fun, we move on and play something else, so we spend that money elsewhere.
---
I actually have a 2 story camp atm with decorations and a collections bot downstairs and my second floor is a vendor, ammo machine and all the work benches.
---
But like I was asking initally I’m looking for places to farm junk to scrap
---
I've had great luck rolling bullion weapons no luck with anything else. You'll love the bloodied plasma caster when you get one. I also got a bloodied ffr gauss mini gun.
---
That’s an awesome idea that doesn’t seem like it should be too tough. Although, I’m not a software dev.
---
It would probably end up creating a dupe exploit, too.
---
Cus he lets you have the tato salad no one wants at the cook out while he keeps all the meat. duh.
---
That's why I make my own, that way I know there's not a chance of e coli. It's a guarantee.
---
Unyielding and Bloodied builds - esp together.
---
Wear a full set of unyielding armour, get radiated and buff your stats to high 20's to 30's, (except endurance).   And then use bloodied weapons.
---
Are you on PC?
---
No, Xbox.
---
I'm running an Instigating Plasma Caster so far, it's not a true replacement for my Gattling Gun yet.
---
I did succeed with a Bloodied Gauss Minigun though. Bloodied with limb damage.
---
Yeah same here, loved Bethesda's Fallouts so I really wanted to try this but all the issues reported at launch caused me to stay away until now, and... It's not bad but it definitely feels like a Fallout 4.5, which isn't bad by itself, but not sure the Bethesda formula works with these type of survival games, at least at a mechanical / design / game engine level. Yet I'm already 50 hours into it so they got the addiction figured out for sure.
---
It's not as if they would be allowing you to buy twice as many modules, they're still only selling you 10 at a time. However, you'd have 250 scrip for more opportunities to throw harpoons and broadsiders into your stash, scrip machine, or lug them around until the next day.
---
I guess if you started when the sale began, and had 1000 scrip saved, you could conceivably get 40 modules if the 'sale' ran for four days.
---
 You'd think it would be in their best interest to let you get as many modules as you wanted, since you have to play the game to get enough supplies to craft whatever it is you're trying to craft anyway. Nothing that Bethesda has done in this game with the limits on it make any legitimate sense.
---
You can try submitting a ticket. But make sure you’re under 750 scrip when you do.
---
They're not annoying I'd you have adrenaline. Free damage.
---
Are you on PC? Wouldn't mind coming to you to grab that stuff, anytime.
---
Added!
---
What helmet is that?
---
There is no way to get them back unfortunately.
---
They probably saw this subreddit...
---
Ok. Maybe this is a PC issue. At least it’s a common enough event and most of them don’t bug out. Still annoying though.
---
Check out kevduit.com it has detailed lists of farming locations and routes you can take.
---
Message me your gamer tag and I'll invite you
---
Nice. I'm hitting 900 base damage with my bloodied plasma caster but I still mainly use my bloodied explosive gatling gun.
---
I thought the event was pretty small. Is it like an actual raid or something?
---
And perhaps more importantly, vault steel
---
I try to keep what really important on my main character. If they did take away my alts though, I would view that as consumer hostile and move on. This would be become the last game I ever played that doesn't save the game on my hard drive.
---
Dude you aren't alone.  People will come here and say "Check the area.. far away.. blah" but we're all high levels and know that already.  This bug is something else, because there is NOTHING anywhere within the event area or even points beyond when this happens.  We've tried using the compass, Berry Mentats, divining rods, juju and nothing will cause the event to progress once this happens.  We aren't bringing tents, standing on objects, none of the usual mistakes.  I feel your pain because this happens 30-50% of the time for us.
---
My gattling gun hits for 1000 on sneak, which somehow dispite the booming shots is most of the time. Instigating Plasma Caster only 455.
---
havent played it myself but from what i understand its a questline ending in what is basically a repeatable boss fight. kinda like how the Lying Lowe quest ends with Encryptid.
---
Yezzur
---
TS is horrible in vats and makes recoil awful!
---
I'll just end up craft locked faster.
---
Naw they’re not on reddit and they unconsciously hate 76 for its review, so why would they be here🙄🙄
---
Don't be an ass...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You and I both know it only cures chlamydia.  False hope is wrong, nothing cures herpes.  The cockroach of STD's (hur hur).
---
One of those foam #1 fingers
---
Just so long as it doesn’t do more damage than the hunting and lever action rifle, as they’re already useless enough as it is.
---
If it ever does appear my dumb as is gonna spend 10 minutes firing off 1 round and reload
---
Go auto and prime it! Bullets cost more but you get more damage and more ammo per craft.
---
The quest is to pick up flowers and other items as gifts for Gail. Lol pick 15000000 flowers. Gather ingredients for the ultimate dinner 1000000 radstag meat. Gather wood and other materials to build a place to party.
---
I think it's still to early to make that call.  With hope they will tweak their nerfs a bit, but at least some things will likely be different from what we hear now.
---
Balancing is rough, and I'm not looking forward to bethesdas take on it.
---
My advice would be to keep building levels and valuable items for trade.  Things whose value wont shift like plans and cosmetics and the like.  Then look at the changes made and see how to adjust then.
---
This way you would have items for trading for new gear and levels for reallocation and perks.
---
But feel free to do whatever.  It's your char.
---
In my experience, this bug only happens with groups.  It works fine solo.
---
More novelty then function.. faster getting what it collects yourself
---
I'm at 580 on my gatling gun base and 466 466 on the plasma caster
---
Thanks dude I appreciate it 🤘🏼
---
Sure! Id be happy to look at it. Could you show me a pic on here? Have a price in mind?
---
Thanks for reply. My point of view was based on fact that almost everyone can run 100m in 13-14s. In-game ghouls are really uncannilly quick in terms of acceleration, you are right on that one, but not too far away from real-life possibilities - this exactly I wanted to say. Sorry for flaming.
---
You can avoid some of their leaps by diagonally backpedalling. And VATS to interrupt their charge animation, also I think VATS can break off stunlock. If you are not VATS user, try to move from obstacle to obstacle, so they can't have a straight line of sight to begin charge animation or jump over them with Marsupial mutation. Doom is a good game to train juke moves.
---
Run up to the lighthouse and snag the souvenirs they are copper. 
---
Ya, you can server hop and get stuff over and over as long as its just sitting out. Container junk takes longer to respawn
---
Oh no! I'm only doing 2700 damage with an automatic rifle! What will I do?
---
I've done a junkies heavy, a berserker commando, and a Vampire and enemy specific heavy/melee. 
---
They're all fun.
---
That 12.7 SMG though lol it was my favorite gun I never had bullets for.
---
We didn't have to skip past NPC dialogue
---
Ps4
---
There are 1911s chambered in [9mm](https://www.springfield-armory.com/1911-series-handguns/1911-range-officer-handguns/1911-range-officer-target-9mm-handgun/) among many other calibers, even crazy stuff like .45 Win-Mag!
---
Yeah I've been doing those along the new stuff (everything is new to me obviously, but I can tell what was pre wastelander because of the holotape only interactions) and they are not that bad but you gotta be really in the mood to immerse into the world for those or they become a bit of a chore (had a friend that stopped playing because it was too much reading).
---
Thanks for the answer
---
Agree.  Haven't tested it myself but from what I have read Rifleman is getting screwed and Stealth is becoming useless.
---
I have played since beta other then a six month break last summer. And I always defended fallout 76. I played solo almost the whole time and I truly enjoyed the story and quests. I always told ppl don’t believe what you hear the game was good. Yes it was buggy but it was their first try at a game like this and I love fallout so I enjoyed it. And I’m super glad they didn’t give up on it. They keep updating new stuff
---
Those missiles explode after lag. Enemies can move out of explosion radius. \*especially Scorch Beast\*
---
Sometimes the behemoth is legendary.
---
Yeah i'll be getting that one tomorrow, tho until we get the camp shelters i don't know when i'll use actually use it.
---
That's Hawt...
---
I think I found my new background wallpaper for the week...
---
Now that you've posted this, they're gonna be all gone when I go there and take a look.
---
but tatos red
---
Except you can't destroy anything so why would they have to repair it?
---
I've been using the same character since beta. Haven't made a new one since
---
I like the devil's elbow up the hill lol
---
I use this on One of my alts. 1 STR so I don’t carry much food or water and am always grazing to stay alive.
---
Supposedly, although why you'd want one I have no idea. It's not a great weapon.
---
They make my game lag like a motherfucker. That's enough reason to hate them
---
What type of effects does you weapon have?
---
In the bog this AM I chased down a Fog Crawler hauling ass away from the event.
---
At this point,  save yourself and get the secret service armor by doing the main quest,  it’s a slow grind but so worth it in the end,  the resistances alone make it worth getting regardless of prefix and the jet pack is just awesome.   If you must buy your armor i have to ask a few questions... do you prefer stealth and are you a high health or low health build because it matters greatly,  also whether you have any interest in PvP is also important.
---
There are three spots at Toxic Larry’s (one on each level of the shack, plus the rooftop). It takes less than a minute to search the entire place.
---
I do the same, on ps4
---
Good Lord we don't have to have USPS lol in Wasteland... but maybe some new Postal Service with name like... Brahmin Express :D
---
On the other hand it would be really interesting if real players are the delivery guys and walk to your camp and wave and drop a package... ha
---
At level 3 you're not going to have the good stuff available to you. 
---
Secret service armor is the best but you need to do the full wastelanders story lone for that. 
---
Most people don't focus on radiation resistance outside of PA which means heavy combat armor is the best. Add the BoS mod for better stats.
---
Right now just use what you get. When looking at armor, see those + signs next to the stats? That means what you're looking at is better than what you got. 
---
DR is the big one to look out for, followed by ER. 
---
Don't worry about legendary prefixes until level 50.
---
Store and replace the turrets.
---
First off, level 3 stuff has to go obviously.
---
As for special points, you'll want unyielding for that.  Don't waste your time at the purveyor because that will take ages.
---
Secret Service armor is great but you'll spend months building a set.
---
I'd suggest just going to player vendors and buy the best pieces of 1 star unyielding you can find to start.  Combat, scout or marine are the strongest ones.  Even heavy leather is pretty good and it doesn't hurt to mix and match.  If you find some with more than one star for a good price, that would be gravy but 1 star is fine.  Look for pieces with AP refresh, sentinel or cavalier if you want to upgrade later.
---
If you shop wisely, you should be able to get a 1 star set for under 2K caps.  Do events like Uranium Fever that have many armed enemies and sell all the weapons to gain 1400 caps per day.
---
You should be fine with different armour.  I run a Bloodied pipe revolver and use one Chameleon with improved sneaking piece, no stealth perks and no Unyielding.   Rarely go into Danger unless I am being lazy and don't want to move position while attacking a group.  
---
You could also consider the Stealth Suit for trickier areas where Marsupial can't be used.
---
This is explains why I'm suddenly seeing less. Thought I was going crazy or that they'd nerfed their spawns. But no, I swapped out Pharma Farma for vats cards. Time to reshuffle again.
---
You should be able to apply a pip-boy skin via any armor workbench
---
Congrats! For me the game really started being great around level 25-30.  Around then I completed my set of T45, got a gatling gun, and could begin investing in heavy guns and tanky perks like Blocker. I haven't looked back since.
---
The most difficulty I've faced was level 15-20, in the toxic valley. Not even the SBQ or Earle Williams have been as scary as the radscorpions that were ten levels above me at that time.
---
It’s vastly improved from launch but you’ll find things to complain about if you look.
---
They won't. They fucking love their time gate
---
Armor workbench
---
They must have upped the infection rate, I've been playing since launch and never had to make them. Over the last 6 months I've been constantly using them, to the point I broke down and actually watched a YouTube video on where the ingredients are....
---
Yet another thing to grind and manage that I don't care about. I'm not a survival game player. It does nothing for me.
---
I *hate* that I love this game still....
---
Unfortunately pretty much all you have is luck with all armor, even secret service armor when it come to legendary effects.  Here’s the but secret service armor with no legendary effects will still give you great resistances.  Other option is power armor.
---
I’d like to see a trench gun. There is a mod for 4 but it’s very loud and sometimes enemies spawn with an overpowered one
---
Combat shotgun skins for combat rifles and fixers too!
---
ok i already have it so i guess i´ll just see for myself
---
Blegh. It took me forever to place them nicely :(
---
Only when I see nuka
---
One time my turrets exchanged fire with a settler.  It just kept going on and on.  My solution......kill the settler.
---
Same here. My favorite pistol in real life. Dual wield is a must.
---
&gt; He makes a comment that humans need to eat plants too
---
That doesn't explain it restoring hunger when you're a carnivore though.
---
Now, I didnt say it explains that... lol
---
How about SCORE for next season.
---
So far the worst I've ever had traveling to someone else's camp is spawning inside their foundation. I did once die due to someone leaving while I was at their vendor, though. I always make sure there's no one at my own camp before leaving; just last night I had to sit and pretend to be afk because someone was exploring my house. Like, I appreciate it, but c'mon man it's 2am I want to go to bed already.
---
I've kept a pretty close eye on the current fast travel spawns and everyone I've seen has spawned on the bottom left corner of my screenshot more or less, but if anyone ever spawns inside the ground and falls I'm going to feel terrible. I don't mind it happening to me, even the one time it killed me I was still able to get my junk by using the power armor glitch, but I really want people to feel safe at my house.
---
For enemy mats do a nuked line in the sand. Around 80 of each.
---
The lobby does take awhile. Turning off team fill seems to speed up me getting into games though
---
Is it me or have disease cure become more rare since they made them sellable? I used to find tons of them and ended up throwing most away but now I struggle to keep more than 10 in my inventory.
---
Yeah. This has been my recurring gripe with NW that continually gets glossed over in the Dailies discussion. My annoyance with the mode has mostly to do with the amount of time it takes to get into a match and how little you can potentially get from that six minute wait per match.
---
Secret Service Armor helmet
---
I can’t kill him...
---
I am the same as you.  Bought it right away since I loved Fallout 4, New Vegas and Fallout 3.  But the lack of NPCs andna few other reasons I put it down.
---
But I started playing after wastelanders and I love it.  Dont get me wrong, there are still bugs but overall its a good game now and the community is great.  Very helpful.  There is a lot to do and learn, it can be overwhelming.  But its worth it.
---
If you loved Fallout games in the past its worth diving into it again.
---
I couldn’t agree more, having plans for all the common outfits would be great. Although I still think the rare ones should still have to be found or rewarded just to keep them rare.
---
Or, let them have at... Emerson deserves it...
---
They can't because Ward would cease to exist.
---
Vault steel too please 😩
---
If you angle it properly, it should work, but it's by no means easy. I managed to get mine setup on one wall in my room, but I was having the same issue with the posters and a few other things.
---
i´m just not really a fan of playing games with other people but i´ll try again
---
Much better content but still super buggy.
---
In lockdown here in Vic Aus so I got nothing better to do than Meat week so I dont mind slinging extras. Happy Gaming.
---
My memory is a bit faded but I do believe some events used to drop disease cures and antibiotics back in the early days but for some reason you never see them now. Which is a shame if that is the case.
---
Yeah but he doesn’t die that’s the things AND HEY NO SPOILERS K
---
It took me probably 250 modules to get a full set  of 3* unyielding and over 100 of them was for the damn left arm...
---
Unpopular Opinion:  The wasteland is harsh,  perhaps it’s for the best,  what man deserves for his arrogance.
---
There are also always those there to help, do you need any materials to rebuild?  On the house whatever I can do if you couldn’t leave in time.
---
Even better is the fact that if you eat more than one it kills low health players.  Sometimes just one will kill you.
---
Dog food. You eat dog food.
---
Ah, so that's how I've been mysteriously dying. I eat everything in sight too though 🤔
---
Sorry, I meant 3 star legendary!
---
By “level 3” do you mean to say that your armor is 3-star legendary?
---
Or maybe Bethesda could you know... add the most basic of trade protections that have existed for a bit over 2 decades.
---
At this point i'm honestly betting Austin is just too incompetent to add it.
---
That's a good one I'll look there next time
---
Some enemies have a special attribute which gives them max perception. It's next to impossible to stealth those enemies, so don't bother.
---
Patch 22 spoiler..
---
&gt;!ALL of the enemies in the upcoming Daily Ops missions are like that.!&lt;
---
Yes they are legendary but certain weapons are called legacy weapons by the community like the exploding laser rifle
---
Weapon balance
---
Nice.
---
I need to try some nuka shine, I hear it’s a real trip
---
I'm trying to play a high health build, don't really want to get into that while bloodied stuff. I stealth a little, but not enough to make it my main playstyle
---
just rub the water on your cooch, its magical, trust me
---
Every one I've been in, the stray mobs were visible on the radar.  I've gotten in some halfway through that failed due to the timer, but I've never seen one where there wasn't some indication of what was going on.
---
Not to say it doesn't happen, it just hasn't happened that way to me.
---
Just imagining a guy in liberty prime power armor on a schwinn doing a bunny hop past a workshop.
---
I’m 124 rn, and I didn’t really realize how bad it was until Colossal Problem. Dear god, I don’t have any shotgun perks and my combat shot gun is the only way to kill those wendigos. 3 magazines from a Lever action for a single wendigo is just too damn much.
---
Me too. And it cannot be edited or removed because you cannot put the cursor on it.
---
THAT’S what’s been happening
---
3 in the son of Dane compound
---
Yeah i can usually never get it to work unless it's forest primal cuts. I don't know how most other events work 90% of the time but this one is fucking broken
---
Yes, the prime cuts event never even started on three different servers for me. If I saw the server was getting thin, I'd jump to one that was populated. The event would be well attended but would never launch. People were just standing there waiting for the event to begin and it didn't. Meat week has been buggier than a picnic this time around.
---
I played another survival game that had bikes and dirt bikes randomly spawn around the world.  They were faster than running but not greatly.  If you got off the bike it would stay where you left it for a short time and then respawn somewhere else in the world (to keep people from hoarding them).  It was fun looking for them and riding around the world.
---
Where?
---
it makes it furious waiting 6 minutes just to potentially die 2 mins in
---
I mean it’s not for everyone but it was a lot of fun for a lot of us.
---
Thank you lol but I have lots of materials. I guess I just don’t really see the point in sitting around waiting for the nuke to destroy my base. I don’t really need validation from the trolls
---
One on top of speaker on stage, one in the shooting range beside the barn, one in the house 2nd floor beside the computer
---
Ahh.  All Unyielding?
---
I was the same way as well. You dontnreally havebto interact to much with people.  all the quests are solo.  you can buy stuff from people if you want.
---
I've got a wall that I've wanted to add it to ever since it was first datamined, and I'm just two levels away from unlocking it now. I don't even plan to use it as a door, I'm going to replace the doorway to a solid wall and lock it so that it's purely a fireplace. Bethesda almost screwed that plan after update 21, and I am so glad they reverted it.
---
Yeah those last minute shoppers are hilarious. They get paranoid like you're waiting to punji them hahaha
---
Nah, they're all random, just sorta stuck with what suits best, there's absolutely no order to it
---
Yeah, my bad
---
That's basically the lever action that's already in game. With the dumbed down ammo types, they don't differentiate between .45ACP and .45-70, but the lever action is the same as the one in 4, which *was* .45-70.
---
Van/Sent is probably pretty good as well seeing how it gets traded on the market but I’ve never used it.  Also with AP refresh is preferable.  I’d imagine focusing on vanguard pieces would be a good start.  It’s great for pve and I imagine could be for pvp.  Sent/Ass Cav/Ass is probably better for the latter though.
---
That Insult bot was trying to warn you about your camp being nuked. Unfortunately, he could not go against his programming so all he could do was to send you the pre-scripted message. The insult bot is glad you were able to server hop in time and he wants you to be happy :)
---

---
Reminds me of something.
---
Go for Unyielding Combat Armor.  Add the BOS mod.  Other than SS, that is the best in my opinion.  You are looking at more like 5K for a decent set.
---
It generally runs alright for the most part but certain actions seem to cause a bit of lag. Aside from opening up my inventory at a vendor and such, I think getting hit by a ghoul tends to be the worst.
---
By design? Why? It's like punishing a specific play style while letting the rest enjoy their builds, it makes no sense
---
No spoilers, I just think he's annoying, lol. Keeps walking away whenever I talk to him.... Or when he's talking to me... So rude... Lol
---
And different effect receivers, like bows.
---
Not as shitty or buggy as Bear Grlls last bowl movement, but it just works
---
Im on pc and actually wondering if the update that added a Colossal Problem is causing issues behind the scenes. Iv noticed an increase in glitches and poor performance since they added it in.
---
I eat the dog food. I am a good boi
---
&gt;I’m being downvoted so the “secret doesn’t get out” but you’re happy you saw it, right?
---
As if Bethseda hasn't been fully aware for days. Didn't even know it was a secret
---
Okay that makes sense. So maybe settle into grinding bullion to buy the SS?
---
I do this with stimpacks, rad x, and radaway but I use super duper and chemist while I do it. Once I run low on the non water items I use to do that I just start selling water and I also put the extra water in my vendor (after I sold what I can for the day everything else is extra) at 1 cap per water because not everyone is willing/able to sit for minutes just farming water (now they can use the water to make money as well). Even better now that the seasons have started because people are forced to buy/sell 3 items to players (meaning they can buy 1 water 3 times to get this done and sell it to vendor afterward). I also put candy from the monster mash event in the vending machine at 1 cap because it counts as old world food and it sells to a vendor for 1 cap (so if someone bought all the water there is another option for people to get for the score).
---
It’s a skin for the Bowie knife or combat knife. I can’t remember which. It’s not a weapon on its own though.
---
I was at the toxic valley and a snally ran all the way to the Crater. It was so far that the distance meter wasn’t showing but I got the bastard.
---
I don't see why a ban is needee lol. It does the same thing as the Armco factory. And plus its glitched and eats up badget. Just make it buildable one per camp lol
---
Yeah I was looking at BOS stuff, but from what I'd read the plans were bugged. Or is that not the case now? Is there a vendor that stocks the plans?
---
How much is in your inventory? There is a know lag issue when you're carrying lots of stuff. It might be causing the pick up / use lag.
---
Stealth buffs have taken a huge hit in the PTS anyway, so investing less in stealth perks and more in damage suppression and rejection perks is better. I got rid of sandman and moved the points to charisma to max out suppressor and it's made daily ops a lot better.
---
You don't keep the stealth buffs in daily ops when you're in danger though. It's really unfortunate that the max perception ability is default for them and not one of the abilities that changes like the others do.
---
Had that yesterday for 1, I think ti was because I DC'd and came back late and didn't get to pump a lot of damage out even though she still had loot.
---
Ok thanks I tried the Bowie so it has to be the combat you saved me from a small melt down
---
It is for the combat knife.  You add the skin to it.
---
Yes, yes.
---
Just yes!
---
Sure you did enough damage?
---
Yep, I've got about 250 on me last I checked and I rush for downed players faster than the average player rushing for the managers at Uranium Fever, and yet I still slowly accumulate more than I spend.
---
They actually did stack when duped in the early days, as did guns!
---
Um.... there were always side quests
---
Best Reddit name I've seen today. Upvoted for hilarity.
---
Honestly, I’m enjoying the social endgame aspect but the game is still a great fallout solo experience. It’s a really rich world worth exploring, and it’s an easy 100 hours before you have to touch a multiplayer aspect if you don’t want to.
---
OP is likely aware of this but rather have it a set in stone cycle.
---
I rolled with a set of UNY BOS all the way through the 300's.  Had Deep Pocketed and the leg mod that reduces AP cost when running (Sleek Perhaps).  No problems with it at all.  If memory serves, the Grafton Station Vendor has the plans.  You might also check the Free States vendor downstairs in the Whitespring.  I think the mods roll thru the vendors randomly, so you may have to hop a bit to find the ones you want.
---
Because it stops you from playing that specific character at different times!
---
If it was a set timer every day, you could do any character in any order without missing out and extending your timer!
---
you mean the community that every couple months is having a melt down over whatever current problem there is? rampant cheating? price gouging? broken patches? sub was on fire when something so simple as the ammo converter came out
---
since you seem to have the memory of a goldfish heres a brush up on what youre conviently forgetting
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8
---
The long term goal would probably be Secret Service armor (currently considered the best) but it's going to take a looooong time to unlock it all as well as the mods. And then quite a while longer to roll (i.e. RNG) the effects you want.
---
In the meantime, go through the steps to unlock the Chinese stealth suit so you can run around in nuke zones and be stealthy should you choose.
---
Also, consider keeping a set of Excavator Power Armor on you for it's usefulness.
---
Other than that, keep earning scrip, daily caps, and farm for legendaries, so you can slowly get the armor you want.
---
A viable rifleman build that doesn't use bloodied and predominantly doesn't use stealth is going to struggle a fair amount to put out enough damage and will have a serious challenge with crowd control. If you can pull it off, kudos to you.
---
For legendary armor effects, try slowly gathering a collection so you can try out matching sets or a mish mash that you feel works for you.
---
Lastly, if you are going to just stand in one place and fire at the baddies, consider a full set of Sentinel armor. Even further, as an example, I have a full set of Troubleshooter's Sentinel armor which allows me to easily handle the likes of Gutsies and the Imposter Sheepsquatch.
---
Grahm's cousin.
---
I love this shit. Yeah it has its moments and some busted ass shit, but what doesn't really.
---
I’ve only have the auto-complete happen to me.. once.. today..   while I was logged in during the daily reset.. 😭.  I still about 30 levels from completing the board. I’m not sure I’m going to make it.
---
Oo dam das thiccc
---
If you initiate the next part of the quest he goes away (at least temporarily)
---
I kinda thought they were gonna be included.....
---
He kept cloning himself at my camp...
---
Thanks for the tip 🙏🏼 I’ll have to check that out
---
just look what they did with FO1st. they got people pulled back in. it will be a while til they add anything. it's sad. they have done a shitty job with this game. band-aid after band-aid, but in the end it's still a broken leg.
---
How the hell do I get a disease while wearing power armor
---
Same happened to me yesterday. It irks me that all this stuff is (supposedly) limited time and yet this stuff happens constantly and they just... Don't give a shit. You contact customer support and just get a "yeah we know lol" auto response
---
It happens to me at quite often during Encrypted and the SBQ...I had good luck lately with just waiting like 5-10 minutes and you can eventually respawn. Crazy this hasn’t been fixed it’s been around a long time..
---
Because Bethesda nerfed explosive weapons into oblivion!
---
So do you think maybe I should lean into stealth a little more? I get super overwhelmed with the amount of builds and what not there is to go for!
---
Thanks, I might have to check that out
---
If you have recent intel.....
---
TSE weapons were godly. You could get explosive effect on energy weapons
---
Logging out in power armor would recharge your fusion core
---
Nuking whitesprings was crazy good xp and legendaries. You could buy unwanted legendaries at the WS vendor
---
SBQ dropped serum recipes
---
Each vendor faction had a 200 cap limit. You had to visit all 7 to get your 1400 caps.
---
The handmade plan wouldn’t be in stock passed a certain level. People made alts to level again and get it
---
Purveyer sales shouldnt even need this up on the subreddit.. 😅... it should be a no brainer for bethesda to treat the playerbase right.. not do the tottall opposite ...
---
What I would do if were you. Not gonna lie,  it’s a grind but it’s worth it for sure.
---
I know they are adding the ammo converter and chicken coop if you didn't get them from the Legendary Run and lunchboxes to the gold vendors.
---
Nothing to do with bloodied, or missing one. People are soloing the boss with non-bloodied builds. You need to work on your character and fine tune the gear and build. You can't expect the toughest boss in game to be a pushover doable with entry level stuff.
---
This is a HUGE problem.
---
Yep. For like twenty fucking experience and to stay at 0/1 for daily progress. :/ whee.
---
yeah yeah but i meant like ones that npcs gave you
---
I’ve had that happen in the toxic valley. Other areas seem to go okay for me.
---
Happened for me today too on xbox one
---
So IIRC their language was something like “we will see how the patch goes with pc and if there aren’t major issues it will be out on console by the end of the week”. Judging by posts here it seems like there are a few issues.
---
Trying to remember of the destroy/repair trick works on turrets, to reset them? Destroy with flamethrower and repair?
---
Then of course, you server hop to buy more.
---
I can't believe this event was beta tested. It was probably only beta tested by bloodied players so no one noticed that ir's actually messed up.
---
I've got my eye on you..
---
A colosal problem
---
I mean as long as it still flies and doesnt use the exact same attacks as the Mirelurk Queen im fine with that
---
Funny guy. My character is completely specced for damage, I was stealthing the entire time.
---
I guess we’ll see the event with patch 25 lol
---
Finally someone with the guts to help
---
We've known about this since the beginning, I don't understand why people are so confused and upset
---
Why does an NPC have to give you a side quest for it to count? Did you not like the mistress of mysteries quests?
---
I don't at all doubt that most of the lag is due to my inventory. Though, being a non-1st player, the lack of a scrap box makes inventory space...a hassle? Not sure the best way to phrase it.
---
Next update will add Lunchboxes you can buy for 100 bullion a pop, the Ammo Converter and Chicken Coop if you didn't get them from this season's rewards, and four mods for the War Glaive, a new 2h melee weapon you can get as a Daily Ops reward.
---
It's not "too" bad
---
Oh what the fuck. Every time I play this piece of shit there's a new disappointment. Definitely time to take an extended 8 or 9 or forever month break again.
---
I like the door, but man it really needs to work with all door frames.
---
Well.. Hate to break this to you but then you propably just suck. Or just think you are "completely specced for damage". Like i said, **people are soloing the boss without bloodied**.
---
Because its complete bullshit???😉
---
Because my charisma is 1, and I’m not grinding xp for hours to make my build weaker, just so some strangers are slightly happier
---
Every time I remember to look for that I’m not playing. I’ve been playing since BETA and never stumbled across it.
---
They are willing to do double score which shortens the grind.
---
I just want to play the event lol
---
Personally, I find it works best with a mix of builds. Play it like a traditional MMO; full health players are the 'tanks' and absorb the damage, draw the aggro, and distract the boss. The bloodied dps kill the adds (for adrenaline), and then unload into the boss.
---
Orrr you can just cheese the entire thing and all just use 'magic' weapons on him. That works too.
---
*grabs a flamethrower*
---
Was new to me and I saw myself flickering between 1 and 0 votes all day haha figures I spiked a surprise. Glad I’m not the first one
---
Psychotats, covert operative, full sneak, full damage perks, adrenaline. What more can you get? If there is something, let me know what I'm missing.
---
The purpose is to get a weapon good enough for you to damage the SBQ before magic weapons kill it.  It’s a shit purpose but thats where we are right now
---
In a game with no communication if no one has a mic?
---
Skill? Knowledge of the fight? Boss mechanics?
---
Correct, you cannot trade those with people, but they were taken straight from his stash box. Not his vendor. They were purchased for whatever the game values them at. From his STASH.
---
You've missed so many posts
---
This is a server/client thing and it seems to be intentionally like that.
---
The client decides if it's place-able, makes it green if it seems ok, when you click to place it the server checks if the placement is valid or not from it's side and if it's not you get an error message. The things the server is checking for might be attributes they chose not to code into the client side so they could make changes to them more easily via server side hotfixes.
---
I got lucky and only needed 60 or so for a near full set.  My heavy unyielding powered sentinel leather right arm is all that is left and that has consumed about 100 so far.
---
Yeah. What is it with the left arm?
---
Yeah, i know! But there isn't really much interiors who could work well. I'm really happy about how the bedroom went out, but still i would like to fill better the kitchen and the drink room. Saddly the mount head are not so good :/
---
This better not awaken anything in me.
---
It's kinda cute that you think that was an explanation of why my suggestion wouldn't happen. A few people have said it won't happen, and I think there's more than one who identify the reason as being profit-driven. Which is valid. Your comment was in no way an explanation of why my suggestion wouldn't happen, lol.  
---
However, if you can provide evidence that Bethesda routinely limits content for no reason other than "people cheat", then I'll happily say I was wrong.   
---
That's why your comment was irrelevant. You're butt hurt about cheaters, and I don't blame you for that, but it's simply not relevant here. Period.
---
You're not flaming, it's cool. At least I didn't take it that way.
---
The main problem is even getting a good distance between me and them if they spot me. And I do use VATS but the second I break out of it to heal it's more or less over. Also Marsupial seems to do jack shit, as the ghouls have the most ridiculous reach, hitting me even as I'm near apex in a Marsupial jump. That's fairly broken imo.
---
Missiles and mini nukes cure diseases too /s
---
The bug is still there, they never patched it!
---
Im not holding my breath for even a temp ban. Unless it messes with the atom shop Bethesda does not care. 
---
But still It will be a great day if Bethesda bans you and everyone else who used the ammo factory glitch. At the very least i hope they leave it disabled and as a permanent part of your camp budget. Would be a bonus if they wipe these  accounts as well.
---
My biggest issue honestly it's the daily limitation. I'm here, right now, on my day off ready to spend my time pursuing my goals and oh wait, nevermind. I'm not allowed to get more than 150 scripts a day off the trading machines. It's annoying to be sitting on a pile of legendarys for scripts and having to wait several days to actually script all of them. It makes the game feel more like a obligation/chore than actually a game (oh shoot, don't forget to log in today to quickly trade your legendarys!).
---
I didn't even realize they weren't.
---
Now I'm sad;  and don't give a damn at all about the sale.  Modules is the only thing I even buy.
---
Thought the mayo was a little off. Shouldn't have left it in the summer sun, in... a super mutant's... loincloth...
---
If the system doesnt recognize you doing 1k damage it will do this.
---
Sometimes dying resets the count on damage youve done, sometimes the server just doesnt see the damage you've done.
---
Fuck that its just ammo lol. And the armco factory does the same damn thing you numbnuts vigilante
---
And if you're on ps4 I think I have an extra one of that too.
---
I price my plans at 25 caps for this exact reason; I feel like that's the sweet spot of cheap enough to buy any that you don't already know, but expensive enough that people won't buy just to attempt to resell. Any of the super common stuff just gets dropped at train stations or directly at players' feet, though.
---
They already said that won't be the case, but who knows, it could glitch and carry over anyway.
---
This doesn't always work, the game usually makes 4-5 fixed spawn points and only makes new ones when more foundations are placed.
---
I would love to trade stuff I didn't want to other characters on my account via a mailbox, but that's a whole different discussion
---
Only 3600 bullion to unlock this. Receivers and mods cost 500 a piece
---
That's kind of what I used the original trade glitch for... To get one of my alts set up with a secret service jetpack.
---
LMAOOOOO
---
Not for legendary weapons or armor.  Bethesda has never discounted legendary modules, offered double gold, raised the scrip limit or any other method of shortening the grind for those.
---
They took out the mic chat?
---
It's very nice... but also very cavernous. The big issue is, by making it big and giving yourself tons of room between items... you give yourself tons of room that's empty. I usually have rooms no bigger than 2x3, and smaller if I can cram stuff in. I have a kitchen with a chem station, stove, wooden fridge, and a brewing station crammed into a 1x1, and it looks incredible. Just freed up some budget so I can decorate even more.
---
I'm guessing it's being downvoted due to the repetition.
---
I've read at least 2 other threads on here about it already.
---
Armor bench and hit repair/modify
---
I agree that the daily limits are awful. I *am* okay with weekly or monthly limits though. MMOs have thrived for decades with those and they allow flexibility in when you play.
---
Thank you I wonder if they plan on adding more than that with the BOS update
---
We all heard about the holy mothman, but may I peak your intrest.. With... The holy charlie, the moo-moo. Take out your tato salad people, and put on your moo-moo outfits, then go and spread the word of love. And delicious corn!

I was looking forward to putting guns on racks behind it.
---
I don't run pharma pharma and I rarely make disease cures.  I just offloaded 40 or so onto my bank to save weight (along with a lot of other things).

Be diligent when you're farming, and ignore diseases that don't really have adverse effects on you.
---
 Who made you God to say  
---
I'll take your life from you

No, they need to NOT drop them so I can keep selling them in my vendor!
---
Same, was busting up with my wife about it.
---
You lose the 30 bonus hp then regain it, even if the 30 hp kills you. Kinda funny big imo

If there was another way to explore the vault I woulda free but 3 mins is way to short to listen to any of the holotapes!

---
Im not on the forum all the time. I only have time to look through hot and there’s usually nothing there that I see. Instead of just saying I’ve missed so many posts can you tell me *what* I’ve missed lol
---
How else do we farm fake internet points from fellow thirsty gun nuts?
---
I am all for it, mind you... just as a skin, not as a new weapon. The legendary pool is already kinda shit as in, no need to make it worse for a slightly different rifle.
---
If you’re on a public team there’s a chance you can force quit the game then log back in and rejoin your team in their world to get your loot
---
Grahm is a free spirit. He travels the path of dharma and cannot stay in one place.
---
Well god fucking damn what’s the best reddit name you’ve seen in two days?
---
Didn't know we are playing gods here, making female super mutants, creating rules for them, then violating your own rules and justifying yourself with another version of that rule. Plus, I'm pretty sure the 34.B rule was actually something about cheese 🧀🤔
---
Oh sorry I fast read your comment and missed a couple words.
---
Never go for the savage divide one, that one bugs out 80% of the time, the toxic Valley seems to be the easiest method!
---
Last post I saw from Bethesda said early this upcoming week.  So maybe we'll luck out and see it tuesday, maybe we won't.
---
Still yours!
---
We don’t talk about Rule 34.B...that’s rule 34.C
---
Did you even read what op wrote? Gun was shooting confetti. It is a very well known hacked item that has been in game for some time now.
---
Are they?
---
ARE THEY?!
---
Thanks.
---
One more question...how much damage exactly does someone need to inflict on the SBQ to get the kill in the challenges?  I ask because I have done enough damage to SBQ when I'm playing solo to get the drops...meaning I myself did the required 1000 damage.  No matter how many times I try the event I can't seem to get that challenge to complete and wonder if it might be a bug.
---
I tried that but no option to rejoin my team it just put me in a new world.
---
This is why I never play Fallout / Elder Scrolls on a console.  This mod is nice - perk swapping far better.
---
Haha fuck, I got unyeilding SS last week, but want Vanguards. Feelsbadman
---
Feels like a better idea for an alt
---
Oh no, my magical weapon just destroyed SBQ in less than a minute, in the name of Tod and all things buggy, I have no idea how this happened 👉👈
---
Understandable
---
Good work!
---
Aw that sucks man 😕 it’s not a sure thing anyway, sometimes even when you rejoin the world the enemies are gone
---
It’s a skin for your power armour, apply it like a paint
---
Ps4?
---
You would need to restart your entire build. Not worth it, trade it as it is valuable
---
Maybe don't come on here speaking for everyone
---
It's a skin you put on existing armor, you don't craft it directly
---
No offense of course
---

Hey btw love your YouTube videos!  They have helped me tremendously!  Keep up the good work.
---
this happens all the time when I try to plant blueprints in nw
---
Yep, I tried to jump back into FO4 and the graphics were just terrible. For all its bugs, FO76 is a beautiful game graphically.
---
I can’t keep up with the ammo, even nuke zone hopping high rad fluids are a rare drop
---
I personally love all my qol perks I use, they save me 600+ carry weight.
---
I bought one of my copies from Amazon (digital copy) and the other one was from CDKeys and was a digital code for bethnet.
---
Both work in the PTS.
---
Honestly I missed the days when I outfits were stacked, it made it easier to seek a stack to the vendor then selling each separate outfit
---
I would have if it wasn't fucking bugged
---
...I’m not?
---
That’s why i said it def could be legit being I can get over 200 without knowing it. I have tried cutting down to under 100. I wanted to use those perk points for other things.
---
Can the glitch with the Raider dailies be moved to Wren instead of Rocksy? I’ll hunt down Raiders whenever you want, but Wren needs to start getting her own damned radio tubes once in a while.
---
Ah okay perfect. Thank you for the help!
---
I'm a real stickler for that lol I'd always double check to make sure - both sides
---
I only stacked a load of moo-moo outfits. A bunch of chef hats, grill / flag... And a ton of meat clevers. *cries in tato salad* 😭
---
What if he sets up where the current meat week location is. He can be given a nice cabin and Chally can be given a ncie shed with a view
---
The mask in monster mash gets auto equipped no matter what you hit to pick it up.
---
Then it stays equipped the entire time you exist on that server, lol.
---
I believe all players are traders, but some embrace it to the point of having 90% wares and 10% personals. 
---
4 of my characters are Bloodied with weapon weight, with one mule being full trade items. 1500 pounds with all weight perks, including Weapon weight set, minus Energy Ammo perk.
---
Just don't ruin your experience with hoarding. It can happen to the best of us.
---
I completed it earlier using a low health vampire's build.   I was hitting for about 120ish damage.  Sure, Bloodied would do more, but I didn't die and probably did as much total damage as anyone else.  Bloodied guys spend more time downed or respawning.
---
I think the key is more in the strategy, chems and build than what weapon you use.
---
What exactly are TSE weapons? I've seen high level players just killing any mob in an instant from explosive mini guns and such, are those not attainable? I'm just level 48 and playing it like a single player game tbh just exploring and building my camp, don't know a thing about endgame
---
Sale? What sale? Details please.
---
Dunno why you're being downvoted.
---
Thanks to drops and trades, I managed to get everything! Most of my drops were hats though, only 1 tenderizer plan so far.
---
PSA: If you see a level 1 weapon and 50 rounds of ammo for free in a vendor clearly marked as "free for low levels", don't take the ammo, you level 400 wobblecock.
---
I never saw that before, i always see it disappear when the event ends. And my helmet is on when i dont since i can use a flashlight when running around and forget to equip it.
---
You can turn off auto team to do singles
---
I must suck then, how were you hitting 120 per tick with a weapon that doesn't buff damage? What weapon was it?
---
Me? I don’t have a YouTube channel 😬
---
Its an exploit from blueprinting the ammo factory from a workshop then  placing it at your camp
---
I have no idea.  I've solo'd her and not gotten it so I think its borked.  
---
I've also had sludge lung more times than I can count and according to the challenge have not contracted it so idk.
---
I think that you finish it, but the challenges fail to update.  Then, since you've completed it, you cant do it again, and thus it just never updates for the challenge.
---
You can try opening a ticket if you'd like but I never got anywhere with the disease one, and didnt feel like trying for the kill big things one.
---
This happened to me too. I fixed it by opening another game that requires connection to a server. There must be a server connection bug or something. Try the steps below before deleting the game and reinstalling.  
---
1. Open an online game (I used Warzone) and let the game connect to its server. 
---
2. Quit the game, open Fallout 76, and try loading into a world. It should work now.
---
Lol I’m asking a question and you come in here all high and mighty refusing to actually answer my question because?
---
It's always good to keep god roll items for trading later when you do decide to make a build. Sometimes certain items are not worth selling anyways. 🤔
---
Is it wrong to do??
---
I wouldn’t mind playing as a courier again.
---
Me: sees this
---
Me: Hans!! Grab ze Flammenwurfer!!!
---
I think the time gates are what finally pushed me over the edge.  Time gates combined with the constant delays of new content.  Yeah I know COVID. But the delays were a pattern they established long before COVID.
---
No tenderiser for little me
---
Done and already getting duplicates for my kids accounts.
---
Im doing it currently. It isnt much, but its honest work.
---
Should have done the lick check, she's much quieter and more respectful.
---
I’ll try it! Thank you!
---
I’m glad they’re changing that though.
---
Hoarding is ruining though lol I want to be the embodiment of a trader/scavenger. The guy you go to cause you know he has a absolute shit ton of whatever you are looking for. I’m not even worried about dealing damage. 
---
And I know all players are trader but they aren’t role playing as them. Sure they trade or sell weapons/armor but I don’t see them making trading/scavenger camps, I don’t see them collecting everything they see.
---
There is a difference in trading and BEING a trader if that makes sense?
---
Wow I must be lucky I have everything except the spicy mod and peppered mod and I picked luck for my group instead of events I think it might have helped not sure I’m trying again tonight when my girlfriend goes to bed so she doesn’t kill me
---
My bad I thought you were the lone vault wanderer when I saw lone wanderer next to your name.
---
I could live with that.. I just want the mobs to path correctly again
---
Yes
---
I've gotten 3 tendy plans
---
Okay so ig won’t do it
---
Still need that grill plan
---
Angry turtle mentioned it on their discord and SH games covered it. No clue why it's happening but make the most of it before bethesda see you are having too much fun.
---
Never a shorter map wait. I think it's not about just the map being big. When you load into a map, you can literally die, because the other guy loaded in 5 seconds faster. Which means it's probably also depends on the people, leaving the map wait, having better pc and such 🤔
---
Accidentally nutted.
---
The hell you on about. I jiggle the stick on my controller every 15 minutes to keep from disconnecting.
---
With Primal Cuts, I’ve blown through 20+ disease cures in the past couple days on my heavy gunner.  I keep getting parasites.  It’s a good thing cures are easy to make.
---
Yeah, time to make that just not be a thing anymore.
---
unless the entire group was sneaking around then your sneak multiplier didn't trigger.
---
Also wondering this
---
I suggested this before and got accused of being a duper.
---
I collect outfits, keeping a few of each on hand for players who want immersion and/or roleplay. I've had so many requests for newsboy caps it's ridiculous. It sucks that people ruin it for those who have innocent intentions but some in the community are just too hostile over it.
---
Oh? That's interesting and worth trying, thanks for the tip! Also haha she should understand how positively cute Grahm is 🤔
---
When I actually laugh out loud at something, I have to give props... Well done, sir...
---
True.  
---
I'm not hoping but I hope the rewards are much better this next time.
---
You think I'm blind or something? Seeing the stealth damage and the word CAUTION should be enough to see you're effectively sneaking.
---
Yeah it’s an exploit.  I wouldn’t do it...could get you a ban if Beth feels like it. Lol
---
It'll definitely make all the concert venue C.A.M.P.s much more lively.
---
It’s definitely faster. People have figured out what to do, plus this year turning the spits and playing the drums during the 2 minute countdown fills the bar. Certainly a bug, but that’s likely what’s speeding it up so much.
---
*wipes sweat off forehead*
---
“It...hurts...”
---
Well, try it out a bit, yeah. Angry Turtle recently did a good video on stealth. But, one fairly simple test would be to put on Stealth 2 or 3, Escape Artist, one or more pieces of Chameleon armor, and one armor piece with HTD (harder to detect). Also, if you find a legendary "The Fixer" that will help as well. From there you can do your on testing to see what works best for you.
---
 Not sure how vats chooses the next target, but the wolf im pointing at that is cureently gnawing on my leg takes a higher precedence in my book that that radtoad mine over in the distance with a 0% hit chance.
---
*you*'re sneaking but the sneak damage multiplier does not trigger if the target is in combat with anything else, including other players.
---
it's a well known bug/feature.
---
There is a bug (atleast i think it is a bug) that allows meat wheels and drums to progress the event bar on the 2min "get ready" period without any decay (the thing you see when the event starts). So if there are people on wheels/drums before the event starts the progression will be well on the way already at the actual start of the event. As an example, i run two account and always spin the wheels, if i'm the only one that spins the wheel the progression bar will be around 25-30% done. One game we had all drums and wheels manned, when the event started the progression was around 80-90%. So the events is really fast now when compared to last year.
---
Imagine... The clubs! Can't wait to see those moo-moo themed clubs 😏
---
More meat for the feast
---
The game isn't really built for roleplaying
---
I think you missed the point of my post.
---
It's an exploit.
---
that is pie
---
There's no real basis for that claim in a game where you essentially become a merchant.
---
A stealth commando build is a better end game type build. I used rifleman for about 80 levels &amp; then switched. If rifleman is for you, I'd recommend trying a lever action rifle - decent damage &amp; ok rate of fire. Handmade &amp; fixers are much better as automatic weapons. You could get a lot more damage with perks like adrenaline tank killer, bloody mess etc. But its your build. I would recommend looking at some of the build videos on YouTube. In the end its your character &amp; play the way that makes you happy :)
---
Not really, it's going to bug up your camp though.
---
Ballistic Bock/High Voltage Hefe, Foods, Overdrive, Maximizing Crits via Better Criticals/Four Leaf Clover/Critical Savvy, Nerd Rage, Survivability Perks like Dodgy/Blocker, strategy.  AAE will get the job done if you use it right.  If you are running high health, your damage will suffer.  It is a trade off that you have to decide whether you can live with. 
---
Earle can be crippled easily, so go for the legs and use the appropriate crippling perk to immobilize him.
---
I prefer Vamps and low health as a good bloodied counter, not as much health management required as with low health AA.  Still doing good damage with Tenderizer and Tank Killer.
---
The greens can be picked by multiple people, which is a handy change. Also the critters sometimes spawn in a single spot so one person can shoot them all at once with an explosive weapon, collect all the meat, and finish the event with a quickness.
---
This. I kinda miss the time when the commandos were "bugged" and didn't target mines etc on vats. They fixed that on wastelanders if i remember correctly.
---
The problem is the teslas. Had 2 low level guys shooting them and it dropped my fps to like 0-5. Some reason it never recovered, pretty much the whole room. I ended up farming screws there wasn't enough fps to even know what was happening. I had already mutated him and brought him to about 3/4 health pretty quick when it dropped.
---
The rest of the guys where including a bloodied couldn't even bring him to half before the timer ran out. I know good bloodied players can do it, but most of them end up flopping around the room.
---
How so
---
Yeah I'm pretty unhappy about it. I think it was a juicehead video where he explains but they enemies all have a max perception ability which counters stealth.
---
I don’t have the memory of a gold fish you greasy nerd I just remember it’s just a video game and I fun when I play I don’t get worked up over small things friend, I don’t want you to get offended I just enjoy the little things, life makes you do that when your at a certain point. But yea I know the problems I know they’re annoying but I don’t think any of those people have experienced red dead servers, I’ve never uninstalled fallout over a bug I have uninstalled red dead because it’s constantly broken, I don’t complain about either I play both because I still enjoy it and I paid for it. In short terms, I do what I want and I really don’t give a fuck about what’s going on in anyone else’s world because it doesn’t matter in the end don’t get worked up over your fictional video game that is just crying over first world problems
---
Well I misunderstood, I play console so dont deal with most of that hacked item BS
---
That was a fun watch =]
---
Yeah I pretty much only get the weekends to play and the daily limits just kill me.
---
Welp guess I'm limited to 450 scrip/600 bullion/4200 caps a week for the 3 nights I can play.
---
I’m here wondering why all the in-game lights are warm and homey, but all the camp lights are hospital waiting room-white
---
Congratulations! Recently I reached level 50 and I am also glad I did not leave this game. The Poseidon power plant is the only one which I have powered on because the layout is confusing - I wish an area map could be more accessible.
---
Just in case you don't get any biters, keep in mind that you'll get plenty of opportunities for revives (hopefully) this week when a Colossal Problem drops on consoles.
---
Sitting afk on the menu randomly earns score, I have no idea why
---
Is this what you're referring to?
---
It can mess up your camp budget
---
Well it could be its own gun, with a faster fire rate than a hunting rifle or lever action because of it's semi-automatic configuration.
---
I haven’t done it very much but the only plans I’ve had drop were the cleaver, peppered mod, and Bhramin grill.
---
I also received a tenderizer.
---
I disagree. Good weapon is a good weapon. I've seen a bloodied guy fly off to another side of the cave because he got slapped on the back by a bunch of wendingos on repeat. Truth is almost everyone has a magical weapon for cases when you need to end the enemy quick. The feeling of seeing hp melt with that junkies 200+ fire rate weapon is what's really destroying the hp of the monster. I honestly can't deal with seeing my hp so low all the time 🤔 also try the shotgun magic build. I've heard it slaps extra as well.
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
outfit is treasure hunter from the mole miner pail event, helmet is the deep mining gas mask from colossal problem.
---
She’s woken up to Graham’s sweet voice  and gone to bed hearing him lol for two days and I didn’t do well with the rewards until I tried the luck group today I’m talking two solid days of only one outfit no mask just hats and meat cleavers
---

VE Fixer.
---
You’re missing mutations. If you’re not going the bloodied/unyielding route, it’s a way to boost your specials. You’ll be wanting agility and perception if you are relying on vats crits.
---
Also, not stealthing as a rifleman is gonna be hard work. I don’t think your build is unplayable but you’re leaving a lot of damage on the table as a rifleman by not getting stealth crits. Also a vats crit build player can probably chime in but if you are relying on crits do you not need more points in luck?
---
Riflemen builds are plenty viable and I have one. Invest in an instigating lever action and go for headshots if you’re going for full health.
---
I take one for the team between waves and VATS them all real quick. I mean, all my stealth boosts are forfeit in Primal Cuts so my underpowered toon may as well do something useful.
---
September 10 - 14
---
I dunno.. I just hop around checking places I know they spawn
---
I have good luck at camden park.. most of the time at least one of them is there
---
I'm using an AAE fixer and I don't get even half of your output.
---
Equip the perk for finding bobbleheads and server hop at Lost Home, there are 2 locations for a bobblehead spawn in one small area. It's one of the easier dailies.
---
Much love dude
---
It helps that you're both doing it so you double the chances. Also I swear, even after entire week, Grahm's burps will make me giggle.
---
Thanks a ton-may be able to find one now
---
I don't have the issue. I server hop at Camden Park (top of roller coaster lift hill, On ride car between Lucky Mucker and Hot Dog Lady) and/or Giant Teapot (2nd floor next to toilet) until I get one.
---
Edit: I use the Perk Card for the Bobble Finder, but those spawn points almost always work for me within a couple of hops.
---
2 shot explosive.
---
Thanks for the tip. Trying that now
---
Appreciate the response. Will head that way shortly if this other tip doesn’t pan out
---
Or Bare Minimum:  let us recover some materials from the Shitty Random Legendaries we are forced to create against the Random Probabilities of Fate &amp; Chaotic Sadness of Universal Chance in order to maybe eventually recieve something remotely near what we actually want.  Being able to get back even half of the used materials could just mildly soften the disturbing qualities of Legendary Crafting...
---
Overseer's house has them
---
I think they should be added to your character's inventory in Adventure Mode when you pick them up from the lobby so you don't have to try to absorb it all while you're waiting to start your match.
---
low health?  Ballistic Bock? Overdrive/Psychotats?
---
Appreciate the tip. I’ve been very hesitant to server hop recently, as the infinite loading screen has reared its head again for me, but i’ll be sure to check those spots when I can. Thanks
---
5 in Watoga: on desk inside transit hub (closest to closet with melee weapon/magazine spawn), on desk inside transit hub locked room (beside computer), on counter in comic shop between Slocums Joe and Phoenix, top shelf in balcony area above Watoga estates (in the bar area), by the tent on top of Watoga high (on the AC ducts closest to Train vendor)
---
On hour every hour
---
I love playing solo. I play 90% of the game solo. Definitely recommend
---
I would absolutely love this.
---
But unfortunately it makes sense, can't have that.
---
He obviously just wanted to say hi and get your attention, that's the obvious overachiever. How many times someone decides to clear out entire dungeon, then put in the card, look up the codes and aim it you? Maybe he wanted to cheer you up cuz insult bot was ruining your day 🤔
---
Seems to be like a minute after the hour.
---
Still, yes
---
1 grill plan, 1 tend plan, 1 tend mod, 2-4 backpack plans, 1 tend weapon, 3-4 moo heads, a few outfits and a ton of chef outfits hats.
---
More powerful too, because it uses 7.62 iirc.
---
How so?
---
Obviously the artificial intelligence taking over your camp doesn't appreciate him. 🤔
---
I've been doing that. It's not fun having to clutch team after team..
---
You sure InsultBot wasn't stalling for the nuke to drop?
---
Holy hell, I had not been!  I kind of forgot you can craft them at the Chemistry bench; I'd been making mine at the campfire instead and didn't figure campfire recipes could benefit from Chemist. 
---
Total game changer! Thanks!
---
This is definitely a no brainer issue that could be fixed by the devs.
---
Right? Once I hit lvl 40 I just started finding suits and managed to find the big ones within a few days of playing.
---
Well at least it'll be a nice display piece?
---
I was about to make a new post until I saw this. Was going about my evening doing a primal cuts. Got done and go to fast travel back to my camp and its a tent icon, not the vendor icon. I see exactly what you saw, 2 level 200 players, one on each side of my camp icon. I travel back to find the place leveled. No warning, no bounties, no nothing. Just complete ruin. As soon as I traveled one of them threw an unidentified explosive projectile in the air and instantly logged off. These 2 players never got bounties. Sounds like this was done in the exact same manner as your camp destruction. But it wouldn't be 76 if you didn't have your hard work wrecked to the ground for no reason.
---
Fair point, assuming we are lucky enough to see it come out! My intent is to grind out these last couple trophies before I lose the desire to keep playing entirely. Nothing worse than an unfinished platinum!
---
I am not sure what level power armor your received, however, if you end up needing a upgraded level 50 suite in the future, add me. I would be happy to give you my set of T60 with BOS paint or a X01 with quantum cola paint for free. I don't use power armor so it is just taking up space in inventory.
---
My ID is Eldyrus3
---
Yes. But if you notice its name is white, so its not hostile. Consider it a preview of things to come when you get to level 50+
---
It's all fun and giggles till you go do meat cook and Grahm looks at you with his soft lips, whispers "Wait I know you." and tendirezes your cheeks. 🍖
---
I know we’re gonna hit an iceberg soon, but I’m just gonna go ahead hop into the water right now.
---
You can do that yourself by turning them in at that time, it's a 20 hour cooldown so you'll have some leeway if you're late. Not everyone wants them to reset then.
---
I hear Richard Pryors voice in my head “awe hell”
---
Sometimes the action get bugged form me too and he just twitches his left arm its very annoying as I use or try to use it a lot because I'm done with using the waving emote . I bought that bundle just for the emote not happy now.
---
We're warriors and we greet like warriors.
---
Pie.
---
You can rebuild your character after level 50 and Heavy Guns perks use Strength, same as Shotguns, I believe.
---
I've stuck with a shotty build. One factor is how fast you go through ammo, meaning you could munch through a lot. I did pick up a Vampire's lightweight Gatling that I'm trying to figure out how to mod to go faster. For something that weighs two pounds, its for fun.
---
I'm using this future for my revenant bonus, don't you dare and change that, i love my salad 😍
---
They messed up the code somewhere and tato salad can kill you if you eat it twice. They had one job. 🤔 Not sure if that means everything is too difficult or it was too easy.
---
Touche, Salesman (I too, have an uncle)
---
Nabbed them all but the cow costume head (don't care either) and am yet to land the mods for Tenderiser.
---
Loving the drop rates. Loving the treasury notes way more.
---
Got it my heart skipped as beat thinking I just hadn't been noticed yet
---
Huh I'll have to keep a eye on that then, again most of the time I'm healing the npcs so they dont die.
---
Buy it! 100% wirth it
---
We learn from our mistakes 😭
---
Its 3.14~
---
6 minutes wait, finally in the game, get killed within the first minute. 🤔 Thanks Todd.
---
Go commando vs rifleman perks, be warned you will chew through ammo but will kill things much quicker.   As others have said, check out mutations, build vids, etc.
---
It will permanently take up space in your budget but also could get you banned if Bethesda clamps down on it
---
Good luck!
---
I think this would be a really fun idea. Youd have to make yourself stand out from other players and really look the trader part. As soon as i saw you, id want to be like "Oh shit, thats trader Joe. Lets see what he got". I wouldnt want you pestering me to trade. You know what i mean?
---
Huh?
---
It still has a chance to be buffed before patch 22 goes live, and the Cryo version has a lot of potential. The biggest change I want is just for the crafting recipe to produce legendary versions.
---
I definitely use it to travel early to the meat week event if I hadn't a team mate there already
---
Yeah, I would not ever want to try to grind all the rep and collect plans on another character.
---
I've seen one flying over World's Largest Teapot, too.
---
Nice try, but if you’re on Xbox you can see me use one and see it in a trade window...
---
His conspiracy to end remains of humanity by force - feeding poisoned tato salad is surfacing.
---
You'll be fine.  You don't need to do any cheats or exploits to make it.   just don't be surprise if its missing one day.
---
People have figured out how it works. I love it.
---
It's a microtransaction driven GaaS model. They don't encourage roleplaying, and in many games they outright forbid it in the way of restricting expression and making character progression completely uniform.
---
We had a few travelling traders before player vendors were added, they were a great addition to the community. 
---
Trap camps have always been a thing, so junk may not be something you want to do, but it's probably the best ware for a trader who isn't deep in the endgame. Be super cautious with new customers.
---
Good luck, whenever this daily comes around, I just accept that I might not complete it.
---
Yes I forgot to look at my t notes and wow
---
Yeah the thought of switching to auto is a bit daunting, that's a whole lot of perk points to switch out!
---
Fair enough! Any ideas that would help make me stand out? 
---
I’ve been playing since beta but this will be a first time thing as I’ve always just done junkies/bloodied builds and nothing too roleplay
---
I like Nuclear Winter, but what also might work is something like the survival mode in The Division imo
---
That game mode was intense and fucking awesome
---
Tyler County fair grounds has three spawns and is an easy, small location.
---
What do you mean huh? 
---
Every single time ive died today while playing the game I get bugged to where it makes me choose a place to respawn on the map to fast travel back to. The only issue is that it places my body back down right where I died so I cant actually fast travel because what killed me is still there and I take damage from it til I die again and repeat the process. Ive tried server hopping and even playing on my private server and every time regardless of if I'm doing an event or not I get this bug
---
I hate it. I've played since Wastelanders - around 300 hours - and you could count on one hand the total number of bobbles I've found in that time.
---
Yeah I took a quick look at mutations and got super confused, you seem to lose as much as you gain... What would be best for my build?
---
A cryo melee weapon on its own is really interesting for sure, I'll probably keep one on me just for the ammo it'll save me from having to craft
---
Yeah i don't understand why people think this challenge is hard. I literally find one during any play session.
---
Yeah, you will thank me later.  I run junkies handmade auto, game changer.   Whitesprings ghouls?  No prob.  I also run marsupial, herd mentality, strange in numbers, etc.  also, high agility stealth.   
---
Experiment with what works for you 😁👍
---
The green lasersssrsrss
---
You've all seen the power armor bug, prepare so for the vehicle bug! 😏😭
---
She looks so pissed off everytime I check to see if she has a mission for me and cancel the dialogue immediately when she doesn't.
---
Like stab me with a screwdriver in my sleep mad.
---
Edit: spelling
---
Yep, damage effects will almost always stack. A BE fixer would probably be your best bet, your second legendary effect will depend on your build’s focus.
---
Which is better to have.
---
It makes no sense to have some things reset on a personal timer and some things reset on a global set timer. It either needs to be all on your personal timer or all on a set timer and personally I think it makes more sense to have it all on a set timer, ya know like most mmos do.
---
Ahh are those nerfed now or unnatainable? Have yet to see an explosive gun in my playthrough
---
This seems very stolen
---
Oh, one more thing.... Serendipity.   I run it on all my builds.
---
You can use the clean sink from the legendary run as a source of water. No diseases.
---
Did you still want it? Or did RNG smile down on you?
---
For a second there I though there's a secret extra rewards after you complete the legendary run on the other side of the map 😭😂
---
Awesome-gonna try that now since other tips haven’t worked out yet (I think I must have some sort of bad luck). Appreciate the tip, thanks!
---
It's not that much weaker, I wouldn't sell it short yet
---
At the very least I'm pretty sure the flaming variant will out dps a shishkebab, which is interesting
---
Yeah. But still it's going on my wall. It's pretty neat looking
---
Just keep server hopping. Remember there will be a spawn cool down on that character/location spawn if you actually pick one up.
---
Heavy is in the same build as shotguns. Don't rework it. I have a hybrid shotgun/heavy explosive gun build. It works wonders.
---
I have to take a Grumper, hope they dont drop a Nuke!
---
Thanks, been looking for be BE fixer for sale for a few days until someone said it didnt stack with adrenal so had to make sure. Will Keep on looking.
---
Big time! Thank you!
---
With the upcoming update 22 nerf I expect we'll only die a lot more...
---
Even with these nice tips I have gotten, I’m still right there with you. Haven’t been able to come onto one yet, but hopeful! I will say, for a benefit that lasts only an hour I feel like they should be more common. Appreciate your input!
---
I see you jellõ buddy
---
Why stop there? If you want way more from a game that barely worked at launch (and barely works to this day) why not shoot for the stars. WoW like 40 man raids, Mario Kart-esque racing mode, a Banjo Kazooie Nuts and Bolts style vehicle construction mode, CoD zombies but the zombies are ghouls, Cod Zombies but it’s just a copy and paste of that game mode (copyright be damned!), a Blood Gulch map remake, Minecraft as a holotape game.
---
I’m still hopping and not finding one. I’d imagine it’s different paths we tend to take. Mind letting me know where you usually find one?
---
Edit: so just here to naysay?
---
In reality there isn't that many plans. A lot of pretty good decent stuff is in the random rewards when you play NW. Two rare clock plans you can find from a special vendor that's a rare encounter. Other plans ar either event related or quest related. Other than that it's all atom shop items 🤔
---
I want to also be able to pose the mannequins with weapons. Imagine coming up to a camp to see two Power Armor mannequins acting like scarecrows holding miniguns or posed like they're cracking their knuckles as they act like two bouncers.
---
I honestly can't wait to to use a broom as a weapon 🤔
---
On top of the shed on Death Claw Island (northern tip of island) and upstairs by the toilet in the house by the teapot are my go-tos :) good luck!
---
Something which explains why clothing and armor add up when checking vending machines from the map. Armor is armor is armor.
---
Meat week has its own loot table.
---
Damn.good luck!

33%chance nocturnal

We can break it down from here

---
~~Any Gatling laser can be made into an Ultracite Gatling Laser (as almost all weapons can) with the proper plan (drops from SBQ, can be sold/traded from players). Ultracite versions have a slight general damage increase and do increased damage vs scorched, however they also use ultracite ammo (you learn to craft when you learn a plan that requires that specific ammo type) which is more expensive to craft~~
---
*Edit: I misspoke. Was thinking of Prime stuff. My bad
---
I had it crashing on me there too, and it was fixed by a reinstall. Unfortunately I lost my saved photos, but the game worked again. Good luck!
---
At the one end of the air strip you can start an event, he often flies overhead in that area but he doesn't attack.
---
So down, but my CAMP budget says otherwise :(
---
I got a suppressors broadsider and nocturnal wood arm earlier today.  No shit.  I shot the two cannonballs that came with it at a teammate and dropped it for Grahm.
---
🤦‍♂️ So, you want less flexibility and fewer caps/script per week? If you want it to turn in at 8 est, nothing is stopping you.
---
See I got a junkie 90% weight reduction ultracite gatling laser that takes normal fusion cores so I was just wondering
---
Nocturnal Multi-Purpose Axe. I think I can live with that.
---
Ok.that is definitely pie
---
My friends play and I was hanging out with a friend when he showed how tough they are and I was terrified when I saw that.
---
Dammit. That coulda been me.
---
That is sadly not true. I had multiple variations on a sign, starting from polite and getting progressively more frustrated. I’m sure it deterred some people, but not nearly enough.
---
jeez dude I’m only suggesting it bc Bethesda was considering it once
---
Oh yeah I ran away from them until I was like level 150, I just didn't want to use up all my ammo and stims
---
From what I've seen it still seems very likely it will occur, as in what manner I am unsure. I could see it being in several ways:
---
\- "The Basement": This form would be along the lines of a hatch or doorway that would lead into a "basement" cell which would be the size of the foundation piece the hatch is set on along with any connected foundation pieces.
---
\- "The Homestead": This is possibly more likely. Upon enclosing a structure with walls, a ceiling, a floor, and a doorway, it will likely give the option to generate an interior cell. Windows would become glossed over to hide the view of the interior and the interior cell will be the same layout of the structure designed.
---
\- "Hammerspace": This is the one I'd hope for in some capacity. One the interior cell is created with say a hatch or enclosed doorway, the interior cell could be expanded upon from within.
---
If something similar to the last form I could see it take does make it in, I am making what looks like a tunnel entrance and having the interior cell be like a bunker inside of a mountain side.
---
Yeah, when the creature can actually kill me, the instant, 100 mile teleportation BS gets old real fast.
---
I hit it last double weekend from logging in right on the daily reset. Triggered it, and I was annoyed as hell. I just don't log in any time close to reset anymore and haven't hit the problem again.
---
So what you're saying is I shouldn't be giving the mannequins sack hoods, bloody chef outfits, and chainsaws...
---
That's pretty damn good roll.trade it for what you want it keep it.hell I would love that piece.!if you want to let it go p.m me I have alot of dope guns rare stuff
---
After my character is set up I'm going to fight them and my plan for a character is a auto heavey guns power armor dude
---
Good thing there’s One Wasteland coming out
---
I'm sure you'll be better than me, I'm super casual
---
Now I can play my level 15 that I put down a month ago
---
Ultracite do more base damage.
---
update: still getting disconnected. I also notice that my internet is out for few seconds while this happens. So is it my connection or my laptop or FO76?  
---
so I have a 2nd laptop, and I run "endless ping" on both my FO76  PC and the 2nd PC ...Both PCs are on the SAME wifi.
---
Run FO76  and play till I drop again. 
---
My 2nd pc never drops a ping ... solid replies the entire time.   
---
My FO76 machine? loses ping until i force close FO76 after it "loses connection".  Once FO76 closes, ping resumes connection with solid replies.  
---
So this leads me to believe something happens in the games session that actually disrupts my internet connection until I stop the game itself.  
---
But why? What is happening tho?
---
Damn!
---
Have you tried the Flaming Glaive with Friendly Fire?
---
Yea the perk is the best way. I just do the dailies with the perk and find at 4 or 5 in a few hours just doing the dailys. Before i would never find any.
---
It doesn't work, I just tested it in Riding Shotgun
---
Bringing that sexy back
---
Axe murderer roleplay. I believe there's a hockey mask in the game.
---
If you get there before the event, grahm says he's been saving up prizes all year to give to humans, which means it's the junk we've sold him since last meat week. Lesson here, sell grahm better junk.
---
Welp today my first two prime runs were bugged and failed, and grahams cook off never happened....it’s been an amazing ride...
---
A guy came to the market place about 2 months ago and bragged he traded his BFFRFR Gatling Laser for the Ultracite one.  Why?  Because the Ultracite one in this case is more powerful. It’s the complete opposite with laser rifles.  I have a BFFR RW Ultracite Gatling Laser and can confirm it shreds,  slowly but surely taking the queens health down even when she’s in the sky.  It’s that powerful and that accurate.  No magic damage required here.  Also green lasers don’t matter because the best mods for it end up turning the green lasers red anyway.
---
Been playing almost non stop on two accounts, I have mountains of hats, stacks of useless meat cleavers, and piles of plans. Everything except the tenderizer plan, that is. This event just might break me.
---
Just happened to me too. Maybe Bethesda forgot to reset the timer after the late start this week. Lol
---
The cake is a lie
---
Adopt me? LOL
---
Test it
---
Definitely have to do axe murderer if I roll assassin's armor.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised!
---
What about giant mutant wolf spiders? I know someone might go "Well aren't those just like frostbite spiders from Skyrim?", but here is the thing, wolf spiders are notoriously common place in cranberry bogs...honestly i'd be packing a flamer whenever I enter that bog if they were added.
---
I have three (Sargent, captain, other) and got them all from Forbidden Knowledge.
---
Thing is, they all look very similar.
---
It takes a hefty investment in perk points, between two and five. At its most basic level you can fix mutations with two ranks of starched genes and then get marsupial (carry weight and jumping) speed demon and carnivore or herbivore. The latter two make it easier to sate your hunger and the speed demon one just makes you faster. 
---
After that there are lots of mutations that have big costs and benefits. But if you rank up three class freak perk cards you can get a bunch with very low costs. So with marsupial you can jump high and carry more but lose 4 intelligence. But with class freak ranked out you only lose 1 intelligence point. So class freak really pays more the more mutations you have. As a rifleman I recommend bird bones (more agility less fall damage) eagle eyes (more perception better crits) healing factor (heal out of combat) and herd mentality (+2 to every special if one a group which you should be all the time anyway).
---
Have a play in your nukes and dragons set up. Add all the above mutations and then add and remove class freak to see what you’re getting for the perk points.
---
Yikes
---
Oh that’s interesting. Yeah the wiki shows that weapon as using the normal cores. Still does more base damage than the non-Ultracite version tho
---
Wow
---
Nuclear winter doesnt have even a tiny fraction of the player base of Fortnite. It takes time to fill up these lobbies with so few players now.
---
Player: *eats some tato salad*.
---
*gets annihilated by nothing*
---
You’re good! Not sure where they heard that, but haven’t had any problems in the past unless it’s a short-term bug.
---
Imagine if the map was expanded (current map is 1/4 the size of the "full" skyview texture map) and we got some kind of bayou area to the ease of the mire. Could toss in some ghoul towns on the water, reintroduce those cannibalistic hillbillies of bar harbor (in a way), etc.
---
I love seeing your camps. Your last camp that you posted before this one was amazing. I enjoy the minimalist art style that you use. Well done.
---
he's thinking of prime receivers which are different from ultracite. ultracite laser weapons can be primed, too.
---
I believe, although I'm no expert on ultracite weapons, that unlike ultracite laser rifles, which have a higher fire rate but lower base damage, ultracite gatling lasers are just flat out better than regular ones.
---
The ranger station in cranberry bog usually will have a random spawn in the room to the right of the bathroom, on top of the filing cabinets, or one in the lookout tower on the desk.
---
If you need to cure your diseases there is a fountain at whitespings that cures them
---
Set your camp up near the alpine cabins.
---
So I got a good roll on my ultracite gatling laser then.
---
That’s just logical, don’t mix medicine (or in this case, steroids) with alcahol
---
Honestly if you wanna help the newbies then it's best to go to them and give it then and there. Even then it could be someone's alt and you're handing them free appetizers. People will be killing legendaries in 3 seconds when you're runing to smack it for that legendary and they see it but kill the legendary anyways 🤔 and even if you get angry, reality is that you're allowed to do that, and you do what you want. Not to mention, it's honestly usless giving them legendaries. If they are being active, they will out level it way quicker anyways. Wanna help? Why not offer free food, majority of it spoils anyways. Unlock one or two purified water stations and stop thinking that the higher levels are all greedy. Everyone enjoys a good meal, maybe they need a few caps to buy an item they really want and they will sell the meat to run and buy it, you help everyone and it's meat week that's supposed to spread love. Look for a solution to help everyone if you can't help some specific group, it won't be as big, but everyone happy. End of story.
---
Until you pop a couple of rounds in its ass!!
---
Thanks for the tip! If I can get the nerve to hop on again and try that’ll be my first stop. Sadly my game conked out again so I think I’ll have to call it quits for tonight
---
Lol
---
The strobe lights work but I cannot see the mirror ball itself!
---
I'll give it a try, thanks! I had to reinstall the game at one point and lost the character pictures for my guys from the previous install. Luckily I managed to save my photos and screenshots folders, so I still have the originals but didn't know how to put them back as character pics
---
Are the attacks the same as the spear?
---
Mostly bathtubs but they can give lights and stuff which is cool.
---
Solid decision there. 
---
Have an up vote.
---
Because it is a junkies weapon it’s probably also a magic weapon and will do extra damage in addition to what it normally does,  my buddy has a magic J LD Ultracite Gatling Laser and it’s no joke.
---
I've played alot of for so I'm taking some knowledge from there
---
&gt; have killed disased ferals before they land a hit, but still magically contract parasites
---
That's because for SOME reason when your bullets hit a diseased enemy it counts as you making physical contact with it and then BAM you get infected.
---
They should just lower the chance to spawn  diseased enemies. 10% is too high.
---
I Will, just didnt want to waste all my caps on the wrong gun.
---
They stack, can confirm as I run a BE fixer with the same setup on my rifle toon.
---
I said it was because I wanted diverse opinions from the people about the two different guns. Because when you make a post about both you hear people ramble on about both. I wanna see what people want more.
---
Inert flux is the most useful substance in the universe. Anyone who says otherwise is objectively wrong.
---
Spoilers ahead
---
Just saying, in terms of Lonely Hills brotherhood members there are 5 in the expedition group. They do pick up several members along the way as their official count in Appalachia is 30 when they arrive. One of the original 5 does die from a raider attack that ruins their long-distance radio. Another of the original 5 is injured and returns to the lonely hills with several injured recruits, but by the time that the expedition arrives, they'd just be getting back to the Lonely Hills, or having died along the way. So could they bring 30+ new weapons? Eh, doubtful. Could they lug some new weapons including the possibility of the Anti-Material Rifle and several other high power weapons or standard issued rifles? Certainly.
---
Ah, fair enough
---
Could have been an issue with the server. It worked for me on ps4
---
Wouldn't sell your screws right now tho. People are getting those from farming small wendigos from colossus. You get almost 300 just from one run. I play with my bf and he has fallout 1st so he must have like 5k of those bad bois by now just form both of us putting it together. 🤔
---
What’s left to discuss?
---
 Sounds like you got it all figured out.
---
Congrats!
---
My favorite is the santatron, gives me lots of lead from toys.
---
Only need there
---
Thanks, hopefully i will get my hands on one soon.
---
I've learned alot more about where I can find things from all these challenges. I didn't always mentally think, this is where I find scorched, mutants or robots. Especially if the obvious place was already cleaned out. I have just learned a couple places to check thru a guide. But this is one of the most tedious ones imo
---
I've ran it 7 times as a Junkie and haven't had any issues.  I go non-power armor so I can use my junkie death claw on the windigos if they start accumulating.  Otherwise I just use a junkie gun or final word.  Nothing special but it still works.  I haven't lost to Earl yet.
---
Aside from a couple failed Primal Cuts (I don’t even bother with that anymore), the actual meat cook has worked pretty much flawlessly for me (I can’t believe I’m even saying that lol). Other people on this sub have reported this happening, though, so you’re not alone.
---
AFKers on the drums/spits are helping with the event, so I don't know exactly what you mean. They're the real meat week MVPs if you ask me.
---
I don't use laser weapons so I may become a trade
---
How about when the enemy dies under the map or dies standing upright and you can’t loot them?  Those are my favorite.
---
For real. Highlight at least the legendary mobs we kill. It’s even harder when we finish a nuked zone and try to find the legendary mob we killed and they all turned into piles of meat and can’t even find them lol and I’m level 257 😂😂
---
That's a good question I ask may self as well
---
Yeah I do a lot of trading. Buy acid. Mine lead. Sell lead. Loadsamoney.
---
This is so true I feel you can read my soul. 
---
A part-time job. That's what it feels like.
---
I didn’t find the lack of power armor mannequins a problem. Since the frames never moved I just organized all my power armor on all my frames in a way I liked. I am excited to display my armpits now but I wish that items on display didn’t count towards your stash like in fallout 4. I hate that all the things I’m displaying take up space and same goes for my items I want to sell. They need to differentiate the two.
---
Is vampires prefix any good? I just got a vampires light machine gun today aswell. I honestly never messed around with much other than shotguns and lever rifles
---
Nope, same as the Super Sledge, Grognak Axe, etc. Classed as a "slow" two-handed melee weapon.
---
I [made a full health build crits rifleman as I would play it. ](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f245bf&amp;d=sg1p02pd2pk2pp2pl2e00eu0cr0c62ic1a72a30a04ao0ar0lv2lu2lk2l12l71lt0i12&amp;w=ir2&amp;m=51c9fe8b3). Although maybe swap out radicool for something else.
---
They are amazing for stealth sniper build. I use a bloodied, VATS build with full unyielding armor and it's crazy OP. Just keep at it and you'll get one eventually, took me three months of searching and offers before I secured the trade for mine. They are one of the most valuable trades for rifle builds, Good luck!
---
I once found a wrapped Christmas gift at someone's vendor, I've never seen it before, but buying it and using it was the best thing ever. Good emotions for 20 caps? Count me in! 🎉
---
My thoughts are the exact opposite. I have the perk equipped, and can walk around for 4-5 hours and not find a single one.
---
Well I’m on xbox so the colossus is kinda rarish. Also I will never sell my screws they are so hard to come by because you always have to use them.
---
This happened to me once with a piece of armor I picked up last week.  I clearly picked up the armor piece and it displayed on screen but I checked my inventory multiple times afterwards and it never appeared.  Nothing really surprises me anymore though so I just went about my day...
---
Wow you're a real asshole and from what I've read bad at the game, a super easy game at that.
---
I feel like there have just been so many random bugs this week. I had some weird ammo/fusion core things happen this week, that no one else in the sub had experienced or heard of.
---
Congration
---
Just switch out the perk cards? I’ll need to get all the heavy gunner ones right ?
---
"but if a Tesla burns out, is it's power use removed from the system"
---
You can think of a Tesla like a conduit, it receives power but doesn't actually consume any (same with flamers, they consume 0 power they just require 'power' in general). If it breaks then it severs the connection between it and anything else. If you want them to fire one after another as they break you would do this: https://youtu.be/9yuwAC_vfvA?t=670
---
Disagree. My musical robot friend stacks those sugar bombs up like a boss.
---
Sorry, was talking about the people who hide at the bottom of the pool or just stand around: I didn't consider the spitters or the drumers to be AFK
---
Ok I’ll keep. It’s just so darn heavy lol
---
It sure does. Switch to bloodied a year ago and never going back
---
Cant be scorched without being hot ;)
---
my power armor and the 32 fusion cores i got for it suits me just fine
---
I wanna put my goolies in a ghoulie
---
Yeah it just annoys me because for each of the plans (tenderizer and the backpack) that I haven’t gotten but wanted did this
---
You’re not wrong
---
I agree completely. Tedious seems apt!
---
I want uniformaty with reset timers is what I want.
---
Just trying to see if there is a way to fix it or bring more attention to it so it happens to less people
---
This. I receive repair kits faster than I can use them. 
---
In some cases it can be inconvenient. My bloodied explosive fixer used to fall apart during Scorched Earth. I gave it away and made someone happy, and don't miss it.
---
I once had a person watch me die right after I revived them so we could finish the event. He just stood there and watched me die with great intrest. Then grabbed my junk and left. I've never felt so betrayed in my life.
---
I have one 😋
---
I stuck with a girl like this for way too long, i guess i just didn't know 'wendigo' ***ba-dum-tss***
---
Says guy seems new, then says ultracite shoots green... 😆
---
This is an excellent idea.
---
Yeah, I get infinite loading or just Blackscreened about once a week lately.
---
There's also a military outpost (I think Forward Station Delta) that has a frequent Bobblehead spawn around the feet of the Power Armor there. I hear the Bobble effect but sometimes have a hard time seeing it.
---
Dolly Sods in the main building gift shop under the counter has one, too. Just gotta mind the Welcome Bear.
---
Unfortunately no, just tested it on the pack Brahmin in Riding Shotgun. Good idea though.
---
True but make sure it's the only heavy thing, I once came to realise I've been hoarding like 20+ of every type of pre war food because I'd try selling it when dailies to eat pre war food came out. No one would buy them sadly and when I was cleaning my stash, to my suprise taking them and selling it all just saved me about 150 space. 😆
---
I'm a big fan of the Junkie build, myself.  It sounds scary because of the debuffs but if you pick the right addictions and cards the debuffs aren't really noticable.  I just swapped alcohol for water since I'm melee and use the party girl charisma card and get 3 strength instead of losing one ( I'm a melee build) and only pop other meds for big battles like Earl or maybe scorchbeast queen
---
Congrats even if it is pie
---
All of my usual spawn points are empty.
---
It's not ideal but I've found using the viewfinder on your camera helps.
---
Wild Wasteland at its finest.
---
the 1st one i got was junkies crit, the second one was instigating...
---
my xbox lost it’s ability to connect to the internet a week after that
---
It is easy to imagine you looking through the window and saying: "That taxi driver is doing really well thanks to me".
---
Dude, if you need caps that bad, sell purified water. Don't embarrass yourself. A single Uranium Fever or Line in the Sand will make you reach 1000 caps easily. Collect all the ammo, weapons, glowing meat and sell, sell, sell.
---
I convinced my brother to give FO76 a try, he played for about 2 weeks and got a Travelling Leather Coat as a quest reward right before he quit playing. It's still sitting in his stash box, unused.
---
They are rare drops dude. You don’t always get everything you want. Keep at it, you’ll find em
---
Dunno, I have 20 of eatch resource in my camp stash and I don't seem to need any extras. I get majority of my ammo from ammo converter and save it up through using melee more 🤔
---
Apparently the Flamer and Shishkebab plans have the same drop rate as the Tenderizer plan. And I already know the Flamer and Shishkebab plans, but the event has dropped me several of those and none for the Tenderizer. FML.
---
I use a gauss minigun 😂
---
Thanks. Was grinding for scout mask before, wich was expensive! im now after selling a couple imposter and moo moo outfits almost at 30k caps. Hopefully its enough to score the fixer of someone.
---
Maybe so, we were all on PS4 too. Server never went down or had issues though.
---
I'm a junkie and am addicted to alcohol.  Whenever I see alcohol I'll check to see if I have the alcohol addiction debuffs.  If so I'll drink it instead of adding to my carry weight.  Gives me a nice buff
---
But did you 'Kiss the chef'? If you didn't, what can you really expect?
---
Quick question with the legendary modules which weapons and armour can you create? Sorry new to the game.
---
Well the balls of Bethesda are always buggy.
---
Sometimes they drop, sometimes they don't.
---
Agree. If you don’t want the headaches of a bloodied build. And junkies is pretty easy to manage.
---
That can be a big help for sure. It can also make it perfectly clear when a legendary corpse has just vanished from the world too, which happens way more often than some might think...
---
Son, your path as a 76er has just started, enjoy.
---
Honestly, my defense is high enough that I haven't noticed and my primary the shotgun, is Furious. I haven't been able to tell.
---
The only thing to balance that would be a PPSH41, comrade
---
This. It's so frustrating.
---
True. Especially during events I find.
---
The AFKers are the real meat week MVPs. A full crew of them can advance the progress bar about 2/3 of the way to completion before the event even starts. So chill.
---
It's the only skin for the mole miner gauntlet and it's a Christmas themed atom shop skin. I keep hoping they'll add another skin at some point but unarmed weapons get barely anything from the atom shop.
---
I’m sorry... any other ways you want me to play my game for you?!?
---
oh lol.  you're well on your way then.  there's only 7 total for it.
---
i just equipped super duper and scrapper.  can't remember if there's a perk to make them cheaper.  i made my own and scrapped them until i had all the mods.
---
Scorchbeast’s Gone Wild
---
Cosmetics will be your best friend. Find something that looks like an NPC. Raggedy clothes with lots of pockets, a weird hat maybe. The biggest skin for your backpack. Something like the new Chally backpack but with just more on it. Pick a weapon or weapons that are exotic, like youve been arpund the world finding amazing goods and culture. I dont know all the cosmetic so i cant give yoy a comprehensive list of things that remind me of a trader. But this will be half the fun of role-playing.
---
Reddit will also be your friend. When you have your character made, make a post letting everyone know who you are and to look out for you. Shit, make a couple. Maybe you van beg a mod to sticky it for a week or something. Post on the market subs too. I feel like enough people will see it to maybe make it a trend. 
---
Im not sure if people can see your character name. But if they can, make sure to put "Trader" in there. For example Trader Joe, Cranberrybog Trader, The Trader of Whitesprings. Something like that.
---
Set up a trader camp. Make it look like a shop or department store. I saw a good one on reddit sometime in the last week. Lots of displays and free standing junk/plushies. Make a sign that semi explains who you are. 
---
Lastly, you may have to be a little pushy with trading like i said you shouldn't. Just to start it off. Stand in large groups of people spamming the money emote. Or drop random crap items and then pop up the money emote. Got to events and always stay after with the money emote up.
---
Thats the most i can think of at the moment. Make a post now and ask reddit what they think would make you seem like a specialized trader. Hope this helps.
---
Edit: Forgot. Wear a mic. Public chat, come up with a slogan and just let people know. While you are walking around and you spot players, give em a shot out. "Hey you there, fine fellow. Come browse my wares. Cause everyone knows, aint no better deals than Trader Joe's!"
---
The only thing I'd understand giving a cap for to the player, is riding one of those mr fuzzy rides. They paid atoms to get it, would be funny if a person could loot the caps that people pay to ride it.
---
Maybe make a cola machine where you pay 5-10 caps and get a cola, that they of course fill it with.
---
But if I already waste my caps to fast travel and go just to see your camp or a vendor, doesn't mean you get the caps but if you do... Do I get a refund then if the vendor / camp is not for my liking? 🤔
---
I know you are not serious but i would take all of that over battle royale tbh.  All of those could actually be sick.
---
I still have a couple meet week flag plans from last years Meat week lol
---
Rip that poor little stash box😆
---
Hownstly, the only reasons why I have alt characters are to have different vamp styles. There is no way I am grinding fraction rep, I rather do anything else
---
The mirror ball is very strange. Sometimes mine has no strobe lights at all and is just a super bright light, sometimes it's spinning super fast and sometimes it spins at the normal pace. If you relog and the ball is still not visible you could store the garage and the mirror ball would get stored alone with it so you wont lose any budget. The ball itself costs a bit more budget than most items but looks cool when working properly.
---
Yes and do you you use Pa?
---
The only issue I have is I think Sophia and Blanche should be swapped. Sophia’s all about getting up in peoples faces and Blanche is more about throwing shade
---
Glowing meat piles and turn off grass in .ini file or install cloudys mod manager and do it all from there
---
I mean if the devs did what the community wanted we wouldn’t have a limited stash problem.
---
whatever dude i just used bad wording
---
stop being so passive agressive
---
You can find scorchbeasts really anywhere that isn’t the forest. My first encounter was on the edge of the ash heap, so be careful when venturing outside the forest
---
What about Dutchess? or Weasel? or Gail? Where do those beautiful women fit in?
---
Congratulations 🎉
---
Dang. Should’ve noticed that lol. That’s a shame though that there are so few mods when there’s 52 almost useless ones for most the base weapon types.
---
My first thought: The dude must've disabled grass.
---
But then I would have to add back all my vendors and everything else in my garage separately, correct?
---
I would eat it
---
Use it to bash something.
---
The moment the stash becomes less limited I assure you, the upgrades will be sold for atoms. If it has unlimited, it's gonna be fallout 1st + subscription for double the price. 🤔👌
---
I've got everything but two tenderizor mods, I got mostly bloody grill outfits as duplicates
---
There are a few places you can find crossbows to repair I know one is at the palace of winding paths to the left of when you enter from the road on a bench , another is at the archery range of the scouts and the other is at a cabin I think near white springs in a room up against a nightstand
---
Ignore me I thought I was on rdo Reddit 😂
---
Bethesda: if it’s fun, they’ll get rid of it. If it negatively affects players, it might as well be an intended feature
---
I started a new toon for the legendary run and I'm now level 64. I haven't even done a single Main Quest, not engaged with any content of Wastelanders, and I'll probably leave it that way...
---
Anything touching the garage basically. Just move anything on the floor outside of the garage onto the ground first so you wont need to spawn them in again, especially the vendors so you wont need to restock them.
---
I do that every time I’m maxed on caps lol
---
I’ll check it out. Didn’t see one at the archery range
---
Mirror ball only seems to work on flat roofs, I haven't had it working properly in any premade structure (it got stuck in an invisible part of the ceiling in the seedy shack for example). When I had a pitched ceiling in my house it wouldn't work properly, I ended up putting a flat ceiling in my bedroom and was able to hang it in there and have it work properly.
---
They will fast travel half into the earth to your location, tell you their one liner and make sure you can't remove them. Ever.
---
Damn
---
You can't use the instruments nor the benches, so...
---
No prob ya you can Google where to find one and it will be more descriptive it's been so long since I did that quest u can't remember specifics on a couple of them
---
Like they give two shits what we think.
---
Whatever the case, it's annoying, I'm missing out on dailies cause I can't find them, sometimes they even spawn under water a few feet from my camp
---
Between this and legendary perks you're screwed for new characters or respecs. I'm now leveling my second character to try a different spec out before committing to any grinds. 
---
This is a major longevity problem for FO76. Alts and respecs are punished but once you're done on your main, what is there to do?
---
Thanks man, guess I won't be skinning my weapons for awhile.
---
It's probably because one of the ingredients is milk.
---
Also it doesn't need to be broken to repair it, just use it
---
Just love chasing that exploded liver down the hill to loot it. 🍖
---
Do you have xbox?
---
Killing sbq and colossus at the same time
---
It's been mentioned here that dropping a nuke, once the Colossal Problem has been triggered on the server... dropping a nuke to retrigger the event, or to to trigger SBQ, either way it will restart colossal problem, as well as chance of summoning colossal wendigo in the Grove if nuke is positioned right.
---
There is a chance to get SBQ, as well as two CWs in one nuke right now.
---
Vats targeting any projectile like grenades are relics from previous fallouts when it actually worked. Definitely annoying but I'm sure far from what's an important fix to them.
---
Maybe they just want your attention. For me at worst they teleport next to me when I'm in bed trying to get well rested buffs. Not creepy at all.
---
 Bada boom bada boom baby
---
I started late but manged to catch up.  If you find yourself close, you can try getting your score up with the xp weekly that is repeatable.  Just pop some berry mentats, canned meat stew, be rested up, use lunchboxes if you have them,have inspirational perk card on if you have it, or anything else to boost XP and run dense areas.  I usually run the DMV, whitespring golf club,  Huntersville, west tech, Harper's ferry,  the burrows, and maybe glass caverns.  Then I go back to the start again.
---
The small game animals also spawn in a tiny location usually in front of grahms cooking station. Couple that with the spit/drum buff before the event starts and it ends super quick. There's less running around and isn't as intense or as fun tbh. But much higher chance of success.
---
Breathing heavily?
---
Or when the SBQ roars and sends them all to Flatwoods
---
Running a main, an alt, and my friend's acct every waking hour on the hour I can say this: the tenderizer plan is extremely tough. That's three accts doing it every waking hour and we've only gotten 3 so far (one I consumed, one she consumed, one for future trade). So long as duping isn't an issue if you have an extra plan laying around months from now with the next events you'll have good leverage.
---
I submitted a ticket for it yesterday and they responded to my ticket with a link informing me that I needed to submit a ticket... using the same form that I used to submit the original ticket.
---
Or decide to start playing instruments. When you're in bed.
---
Ya I heard about that a long time ago (probably a year ago) but for some reason I couldn't find it. I totally forgot about it thanks for the reminder.
---
Yeah its in a round place between the main building and the golf club
---
Happened to me for the first time ever this afternoon. PS4
---
Unfortunately I'm on ps4 lol
---
Right! Although, I wish I had as much duct tape in real life as I do in-game.
---
That's annoying, but really, mine has to be a glitch or something, they don't even walk around anymore, they just stand in one spot saying the same one line, or their spawn underwater, or halfway through the ground or something weird like that
---
I've heard tales of it happening. That's why I rather buy it in smaller amounts.
---
&gt;If we hit the leather donation goal for the atlas observatory 
---
We will. A 50% off purveyor sale is actually useful. People will probably donate.
---
Haha, thank you kind Redditor!
---
Is it the eyes?
---
Yo, I see it! Isn't he the Sherrif from Bates Motel? Loved that guy!
---
Yeah my barkeeper has been being a sac of shit and running around my camp. I didn’t think the pathing would be bad for him but he ends up at the base of a cliff and then will wander around the opposite side of my camp. It’s been awful.
---
Well usually when they get a daily they start teleporting next to me, but you're current, it's most likely a bug or a glitch probably due to the weird location, maybe a specific item or something 🤔
---
Bash bash bash
---
Luckily I got mine refunded but it’s just disappointing, I was really looking forward to decorating and using the bungalow on my second character as moveable campsight really wish they’d just give us an update
---
Now you can get an awesome buff, achievement for couple of atoms or sell it for 10k on a vendor 🎉😏
---
I saw mothman right next to meatweek today too.  He flew back up in the air when I got close, though.
---
You keep this up, and you'll be having yourself a colossal problem.
---
I’d take battery’s included points and martial artist point and push those to luck. That’ll give you points for serums/mutations perks. I also play stealth rifleman, and i love my quad lever action for most mob fights. You can have legendary affects on hunting rifles now, so depending on how you’d like to play that (instigating is effective) you can keep an eye out. Also, legendary bows are a thing, with compound bows available later. Can be an easy spec for a rifleman build
---
The only thing new I have in my camp that I can think of is the decontamination shower, other than that I haven't moved my camp or changed it in any way, it drives me nuts
---
Even if you were logged in during reset, there could’ve been another factor causing it. Like I said that could be the cause but other players have had it happen even if they waited 30 minutes before and after
---
This community needs to both admit that it has a glitch/exploit/duper/grief/hacker problem and then stop being accepting of these people.   
---
I will never understand how some folks just cannot enjoy a game for what it is and seemingly have to break it.
---
Try changing their special ally item sound. Maybe switching between the allies. Hope it resolves fast for you 😁
---
A lot of apparel, a lot of flags, a lot of cleaver plans, one mod, and a lot of disappointment from a lack of tenderizer plan drops.
---
It's a plan, not a mod. You sure you read the note?
---
That's if you even manage to hit the imposter before some dumbass one-shots it.
---
Bro when I grinded vault raids I had HUNDREDS of diseases cures and they lasted me forever 
---
I now have 0 ;(
---
I have about 8 Chally outfits, several flags, three or four grills, just got 5 bloody hats in a row, four peppered mod plans, two Tenderizers, but still NO Tenderizer Plan!!!!!
---
I would swap ALL THE ABOVE for ONE plan.
---
Would it help if they play a clip of Ferris Bueller in his bathrobe saying: “You’re still here? It’s over. Go home”?
---
I really hope that it comes in both legendary and non-legendary versions.
---
Bethesda was never considering this. It was interplay before Bethesda aquired the rights. So your whole base us off.
---
Im using the mod, make balloons not meatpiles.
---
I would definitely take you up on that offer but I’m holding on to them for a friend
---
You played the game, so thousands of things worked.......
---
And we don’t have any sticky projectiles in FO76 to get around it!
---
If the thread did that there would be like 2 posts a day instead of countless wah wah wah my dailies autocompleted or give me atoms I am done with the run. If only people were smart enough to use he search bar and see how often this has already been suggested, but it appears common sense is a lost art these days.
---
YES!!!  Took me a couple of hours to find one today, but I was also questing. When not needing one, I come across them all the time.
---
Grafton Steel is nice especially if already powered by Poseidon.
---
None of the paints will drop if you unlocked Elder for yourself.
---
I think today is the first time I got this challenge done and it's because I went out of my way to look up spawn locations. Since they're a "rare" spawn, find a map of bobblehead spawns online (or reddit comments) and join a public server. Check areas that are loaded in the most by other players (like anywhere near vault 76). 
---
Side-note: I was staring a bobblehead in the face without knowing it was there (ironically, sneak bobblehead). Meaning I didn't notice a difference with the perception perk for locating bobbleheads equipped. Won't bother with it anymore.
---
I got like 13 spaces or so and in the uncomfortable position of having to do dailies for the next two weeks but will defs finish. 
---
Still, I kinda don't mind the challenges and for me it helps control my playtime as I don't get caught up running three SBQ in a row etc.
---
Congrats OP I look forward to joining you!
---
I guess they are hoping that they will have a large enough player base comprised of those who are content doing events indefinitely. 
---
I personally got burned out several months after launch when that was all that remained, and didn't play for like 8 months, but came back for Wastelanders. 
---
Once I get a few more bullion items, I'll likely be checking out until Steel Dawn. I'm the more traditional single player Bethesda RPG type and not so interested in the mmo content, so maybe I'm not the target audience.
---
That one will actually fly away if you shoot it! I’m always scaring it off so my camp turrets won’t freak out
---
Nuke the site from orbit. It’s the only way to be sure.
---
So contest it and fine. Or ask for it from your teammate. But drop them, kill them and the take it is lame.
---
It needs a lost and found box at your camp like Animal Crossing has.
---
I'm in
---
Yes! I achieved Legendary Done today, and I believe my real reward is freedom. I set out to prove I could see a season through to the end without paying atoms to rank up, and mission accomplished. Now that it’s over, I can log in whenever I feel like it. I don’t have to worry about that autocomplete bug. I can even dust off my Lone Wanderer perk. Best of all, I can ignore that challenge list completely.
---
I legit thought that the Jangles in the backpack was some kind of horror themed item with the way his eyes are bugging out, as if his protection from the backpack had gotten shattered in space. I had to go find a Jangles toy in the world as a spawn to compare them and sure enough the toy has the same messed up eyes. That is one seriously freaky toy.
---
Or more draw me like one of your French cryptids
---
I struggle with the Mire and Bog Primal Cuts locations thanks to the auto detect bug happening.
---
Sucks as although I don't die, I'm basically using a normal Fixer (was Instigating with stealth boosts which usually is a one shot) and I take too long killing the final critter wave.
---
I think glitchers hackers and the likes mainly are curious types. I don't think most aim to do things that would be detrimental to the community. What we see often is what is detrimental because we see it. 
---
What 76 calls hacker and glitchers 4 would call modders and speed runners. Certainly in an MMO world where play and build matters it needs to be squashed. But I don't demonize those who want to figure something out. It's those who use it in bad ways that have issues.
---
Because some people don't know when to stop before crossing the line. Want to use a camera or PA glitch to get inside the locked room with the robot vendors for a funny photo? That's cool. Want to be a prick and kill a boss before everyone else can even get in to tag it? Thanks, you just broke the event.
---
So I WASN'T Crazy! Thank you so much for this, I was losing my mind trying to figure out what was happening.
---
The part I have a problem with is they dont define exploits. Example: prewastelnders i want my corn closer for aesthetic reasons. I use the blue print glitch. Is this ok?
---
What about post wastelanders? Now I cam use turbo fert to hit more crops than I should because I glitched/exploited the crops closer together. Now i can harvest much more faster and make more caps. it may also potentially cause server issues because those items technically overlap buffer areas now. Is this ok? Or is it a violation of the T&amp;C?
---
I want these ops this game really NEEDS some kind of dungeon content, some varied dungeon content. It’s like playing a small piece of eso with th end chopped off. 
---
Still enjoy the game but damn I can join a group but.... why? I join the group and have almost 0 incentive to do anything with them.
---
It won’t matter because my bow still misses 3 in a row with a 95% on a stationary target
---
So I’m assuming they’ll be a down period of no score/challenges before Season 2 starts? Unless we get Patch 22 in two weeks which seems too early
---
It will happen when modules aren't endgame anymore. Endgame stuff's never discounted or made easier.
---
It does it every time for me. It says it removes it but it never does. 
---
It removes it during the event if I die, and then if I don't go and get it again it's fine and not on my head when the event ends, but if it's on my head when the event ends it always gets stuck and not even death or equipping another mask will remove it. It's weird because I can put a miners helmet on and the light still works and shines out of the monster mask, lol.
---
So you telling me he was reported more time than the amount of players on pc lol
---
I'm going to hate the answer, but, how much was the plan?
---
Its about all I'm after in the game at the moment.
---
I think it's safe to say there's more than just one problem with Bethesda support.
---
You HAVEN'T?! What is WRONG with you!! They're the single most important things to target, everyone knows that. ... Right?
---
Im in PA normally, are you?
---
Potato salad is goddam delicious.
---
I know that I looked at my notes it just wasn’t there after the event
---
What did you have happen?
---
Yeah... There is no support, lol.
---
If its not 45 or 50, i would call it a scam. Hell, there quest for exavator power armor, plans for it and frame, than in main quest (brotherhood) you get full ultracite one with plans and everything. And not saying that they common as trash, (yeees 3 pieces at most, and sombody May hijack it before you do)
---
But still. Go for 50, do main quest there so much free great stuff!
---
I've seen people using it more to drop joke nukes on their friend's camps since it doesn't matter where the second nuke actually lands on the map.
---
Would rather they drop it on SBQ, or morgantown or harpers for flux, but I've explored some pretty odd nuke spots thanks to it, and that's been enjoyable.
---
Sheepsquatch and Wendigo Colossus do exist in the game already. I guess we should get rid of ghouls as well, since the bombs are no longer falling and there arent many people to be irradiated into them.
---
For exactly the reason it sounds like...when people make posts just to post a picture
---
Lol ok. Welp guess it’s back to hiding in the bush.
---
No, this is super easy once you know the bobblehead spawns. Use [Map76.com](https://Map76.com) to learn the bobblehead spawns and hit up the ones that have clusters of spawns first. Use the perk card for bobbleheads too and it should take you just a few minutes to find one even without server hopping.
---
I did not know that.. I use the rustic sink in all my camps so that will be an easy switch
---
If you don't get it back or need one in the future, hmu. I have 5 right now.
---
Sometimes a glitch can be a fix for bad coding.  
---
For example, I was doing a defend event for one of the power plants and the Angler spawned inside the power plant shell.  I had to use the PA glitch to find it and kill it to complete the event.  
---
Also, there have been a lot of times where I have been stuck in the world (i.e. between bushes, in holes, etc.) where this glitch has gotten me out of it.
---
You can argue that it can be misused, but it has more positive uses than negative ones.
---
That being said, you shouldn't be able to glitch into an event area.  For example, if I try to glitch into the Thunder Mountain power plant, it takes me into the building shell, not into the actual plant area, which can only be accessed through the doors.  They could do the same for the Colossal Problem Event area.   It just sounds like lazy coding...
---
Evidently that's not the case as I have the Elder paint unlocked but not the others and I have gotten the CPT paint about 4 times and the SGT twice.
---
My gf would have a hayday with this lol
---
No, so that's probably it. When you're in power armor can you see the mask when it's equipped?
---
I wonder now if entering and exiting power armor would remove it when it's stuck. I'm going to try it next time.
---
I also have the Initiate BOS paint unlocked.
---
Cant hurt to try. I know my helmet get removed if i equip it, but if i dont my helmet stays on. Might just be under the helmet though, that would be funny.
---
One of my characters is a vendor character - it is a more casual build but what I realized is when I want to have my vending machines open to make caps, that character should also be good at combat so I’m not bored hanging around my camp waiting for customers - so I’d say you should spec for combat  too unless you are sure you just want to sit behind your bar all day or whatever ... I use that character to try other perks though that I wouldn’t normally focus on - so it is fun using her to experiment like that ...
---
You are still just a young padawan...
---
The second 100 is where the game starts becoming a bit easier, less of a grind, and more fun...
---
Reputation trophies are really squeezing the love I had left for this game
---
The whole face shape, just need longer hair.
---
Yes, please. Caps and ammo too.  Bettter yet just give some checkboxes to decide what things should auto loot. I'm tired of spending so much time looking for bodies...
---
Ya for bullion at foundation
---
Remove the daily reset all together. Have a weekly reset for everything.  1400 GB (+300 from Wayward), 10k caps and 1200 Legendary Script all available on Tuesday each week.
---
That’s that working from home power pose
---
I jumped to a tent just outside of the event then walked in while it was underway.  I could tell that it was going on but it never registered for my character.  It ended with everyone else there getting rewards and me getting nothing.
---
I've done many at this point and this was the first time that this happened \[PS4\].
---
That being said, mole rats not showing up until after the Primal event has failed is really annoying.  Then there is the problem with Primal animals getting distracted by other animals or creatures in the area.  Then again, maybe it's because we don't keep drumming after starting it...
---
I'm hearing this has happened to a few folks now on PS4. Any Xbox/PC get this issue too?
---
I currently play mostly solo on my Xbox One. It’s enjoyable, and doable.  But there are some huge frustrations that come along with it, that I think are solved with the subscription service (whatever it’s called). 
---
Frequently, I’ll be cruising along trying to bang out some quests. I arrive at the destination, only to find it’s been recently looted and everything is dead. So I have to come back to that area in order to hope to get decent loot. 
---
Also, I think having a partner allows me to fast travel to their camp for free, which means another location that I can travel without wasting caps.
---
Should check the link in my comment, might have one for next week too.
---
What the hell is an ads?
---
Aim down sights
---
I'm on PC. I'm fairly certain it was Unstoppables 4 that isn't anywhere in Fallout 76's game files or an item you can find in the world... which is an issue of its own. lol
---
I'll try that, thanks. Haven't had much luck or results in the ticket system. I make a report, follow it up and never hear back.
---
I noticed same on my TSE gatling gun.
---
No
---
Well that shouldn't happen. You sure that ghoul was kept at same distance when you were swapping between hipfire and ads?
---
Yeah but I think it costs 1000 gold bullion, or 5days of turning in treasury notes. Worth it imo keeps me from lugging around 10 carry weight for PA plus at least one fusion core.
---
Had this happen once but I haven't seen Graham in the past like 12 events.
---
Point blank everytime
---
Good place to check is the roof of the entrance of blackwater mine since it has a chace to spawn every time someone enters or leaves the mine from the event.
---
Mothman and Wise Mothman will not fight you.  They will just land and then disappear.
---
Vengeful will attack you.  There are supposed to be Stalker, Scotched, and Glowing versions but I have not seen them in the wild.
---
Yes but you'll need to get settlers rep up (to at least neighborly I think) then to get the full suit it'll cost you 5.somethingK the body is 4k and the mask is 100% esthetic it does nothing.
---
The bug strikes again. Today I was logged in during double S.C.O.R.E week and at 11:30am my friend asked "What time the dailies reset" low and behold 5 of my 7 dailies are completed with no score awarded. I am out 4000 points and it would take repeating the weekly xp challenge 40 times to make up for it. I'm never going to finish the Legendary Run at this pace :( I did noticed the dailies completed were the same type as the week challenges so its like the system is flagging dailies if the weekly has the same requirements met previously.. sent a ticket and screenshot to bethesta but I hear they are simply not helping anyone even though the issue is on their end. We should not be punished for playing Fallout 76 "too much" smh
---
Complete the Settlers questline up to Invisible Ties and get the plan for free instead. It ends before the point where you'te locked into a side. Otherwise it's 4000 bullion, which is going to take a little while if your free time is limited.
---
No you see at this point it's the posts that are not those two that annoy the mods
---
I figured it out I believe the blood eagle skin is glitched. I took the skin off from my friends fiance's suggestion cause well why not.....ADS and Hip Firing are now the same.
---
they could improve the game in tons of ways
---
but i'm in a situation that I could be happy with just more than 150scrips daily so I can craft till my heart content whatever legendary i want
---
Lol no.
---
The lack of anti cheat and lack of any form of support by Bethesda will be the death of this game eventually.
---
It seems to prioritize those eggs over literally everything else.  Oh legendary sheepsquash about to eat you? Best try and shoot that fucking egg
---
i've been trying for a right leg since a month lmao
---
yeah I had this happen this morning. We were standing, waiting on the timer, and all of sudden we heard the panic thing happen below us?  Timer ends, rock wall drops, we drop down and kick ass. Then nothing.... 
---
Oh well got some loot from Earl.
---
I got the mod for it in FO4 and its glorious.
---
the iconic PING!
---
Same here. Ive been grinding since it started. No tenderizer plan. And several times i havent gotten any exclusive rewards at all other than a tato salad.
---
pro tip: for bobblehead daily, theres 3 spots at tyler county fair: 1 directly in front of you on top of coin machine as you spawn, then pumpkin warehouse to left, and on table next to big bottle.
---
i have an instigating plasma caster too, with mods it's like a heavy sniper lmao it's fun
---
Why would you not. You prefer not having the ability to normal jump?
---
&gt;You can argue that it can be misused, but it has more positive uses than negative ones.
---
I don't see it honestly. I'm sorry, everything I have seen, spoiling game content, breaking servers, ending events prematurely, utterly destroying any chance of this game having a functional player driven economy, RMT, PK exploits, injecting objects into the game that should never have existed, etc... It's all bad hombre.
---
He got bored and left Chally in charge.
---
That's too bad, how are we, stealth players, going to enjoy this new content?
---
Yep, happened to me multiple times. The lag between spawning waves also eats up the time on the timer to the point that Ive failed multiple times because the last beast spawns with 5 seconds on the clock. 
---
This was not like this last year. I do not mind running after enemies IF THEY SPAWN, but this is ridiculous. 
---
They need to hot fix and add another minute or two to the event timer.
---
Figures. Thats why the event has gone crazy.
---
Then uoud probanly do better with a more well rounded prefix like instigating, or mutants if you run mutations or bloodied if you run low health.
---
YES I WOULD LOVE THIS TO BE AN UPDATE
---
I get what you're saying. There's a laundry list of issues, a reduced work staff b/c of Covid-19 (that'll make things even more drawn out) and it's the direction they're going in as a company in the seasons rollout.  
---
However...  
---
All I'm saying is that if players are having less and less atom-currency recourse from quests/tasks/etc, it ought to be a priority for Bethesda to make sure simple achievements that have been in the game since launch work properly, think it's like "Kill 23 Huge Creatures" for 80 atom and killing a SBQ not registering even though I've done it hundreds of times.  
---
It's literally the last creature I need to get that atom.
---
German guns = Nazi guns lmao reddit
---
Yes I do prefer not having the ability to normal jump.......hence why I have Marsupial...
---
Umm... Anyone got any eye bleach?
---
I got a 3*instigating on my second roll.
---
don't buy PA's most high levels can craft you one if you are nice. try to get a good lv 50 excavator in the future
---
I remember some lv50 that was modding his ultracite PA, he was cute and proud about it so I crafted and drop for him a jetpack he was so happy haha it made my day
---
I was specifically talking about the power armour glitch and how this particular one has legitimate uses.
---
You are mixing in a ton of different exploits, bugs, etc. and lumping them all together into one mix.  Of course some are game breaking and should be stamped out.
---
But you are missing the point that if game, and this level in particular, had been coded right, the PA glitch would never have worked in the first place.  Much like a lot of glitches and exploits, the issue comes down to poor coding.
---
Im sure that's why you have marsupial.
---
we might as well be shooting rubber ammunition at them ..
---
Had a couple failed primal cuts, but then by the end of the night the event just kinda stopped showing up. Took it as a sign to go to bed, lol.
---
When Wastelanders first came out (during PTS, to be precise) I did the math on how long it would take to get the USSS rolls that I wanted, given the daily scrip cap and legendary module availability. It worked out to more than half a year of doing the exact same grind every day to have a 50% chance of getting the rolls to complete my set. That's unethical, exploitative game design, so since they're not respecting us I concluded there's no reason why I should respect them and duped a buttload of legendary modules. I still have over 100 left in my stash just taking up space. Never got banned, never even got a warning, but what I did get is a perfectly rolled set of USSS armor.
---
Lol yeah would have been really frustrating if he killed Earl by himself and we got absolutely nothing
---
I keep looking at peoples places and wondering how they fit so much stuff.. it always feels like I have so little budget. X.x
---
honestly, i prefer doing some public event rather than the queen lol colossus is just so much better overall
---
getting 4 treasury notes and same old ultracite plans, rolling pin, add more repair kits to the hundred that I already have? nah
---
One day I lost 6/8 fusion cores. I only carry my pa for radiation so I'm not really using them. The next day I lost 6 more but then they showed up after about an hour.
---
I also have plasma cores that my plasma laser won't recognize and load. I had like 20, some bought most crafted, all at 100%. Then suddenly the next day they were fine and loaded.
---
Top of the World Ski Shop (Pleasant Valley) where the Robot Vendor is.  One spawns either just beyond the double front door near the First Aid kit right when you enter the building, on the shelf near the Robot Vendor, and/or in the office room near the Robot Vendor.  Jump worlds if you don't find one there.
---
I also find one every so often in the laser protected BoS office on the top floor of Fort Defiant.
---
Sons of Dane Compound on the barrels etc. where the cans are set up for target practice...
---
and many more...
---
That’s way too obvious so not gonna happen
---
Honestly auto loot should just be a thing
---
Does it happen to you that you're firing the UCGL and you've got like 200 or 300 rounds left in the fusion core, and it suddenly reloads as if expired completely?
---
Take over Billings homestead and create an actual farm?
---
They should be quest rewards. I don't mind earning the items but to be level 700 and never get even a Bloodied handmade drop is ridiculous.
---
And you know a mod could easily do this i bed
---
Umm, for ppl who have secondary characters.
---
wasn't psycho killing you on the second dosis too? i saw people taking no rads some weeks ago but die instantly the second use lol
---
Interesting.  I don’t mind the freeze effect, or at least I think it’s better than the melee kill or invisibility effects.  I guess it depends on your play style?
---
Have you ever been invited to a cookout? Potato salad is the kingmaker of foods. If you can make an excellent potato salad, your fame will spread across the land; but if you show up with some underseasoned, flaccid tomato disappointment dish, you won't be reinvited.
---
Potato salad is law.
---
O my gatlin laser started spitting out cores with 30 rounds left in them.  First couple times.just thought i was button mashing...when I hit double digits then I figured it was a bug.
---
Ah yes, I remember when I had that momentous occasion happen for me...was way harder than the legendary run. Congrats! Go sell it for over 10k like everyone else lol
---
To add a layer of fuckery to this: Buying magazines from other players doesn't count towards the achievement, nor does consuming it.  
---
Case in point: The achievement tracker says I haven't discovered or read Tesla 6 and 10, check my inventory, have extras, read 'em, and nothing.
---
Style 😂
---
It's about homogenizing play styles for a more consistent daily experience. The game was never really about builds, anyway. It's easier for Beth if everyone plays the same way.
---
I am mixing in a ton of different exploits, bugs, etc and then lumping them all into one mix. If someone is participating in any of those things they are part of the issue.
---
The PA glitch specifically has been used since BETA for all kinds of issues related to bypassing and spoiling content. Fast nuke drops being the most obvious to everyone.  
---
Also, poor coding doesn't excuse poor player behavior.
---
Why else would I have Marsupial?
---
Awesome, a weapon for melee characters to spend bullion on. How's the difference in damage add up with the new damage formula?
---
Mine was doing that this week as well. If I stopped firing around 30 and under left it just zeroed out. Was guessing that maybe the number just couldn't keep up
---
only one? pff amateur!
---
Seems to happen after you’ve been on for a while, your friends can’t see you online anymore. Pretty sure logging off and back on fixes it (until it happens again).
---
Your "buddy" and then your "girlfriend"....suspecious, someones been droppin nukes when your not lookn
---
Or, more true to lore, the fists of power armor should hit like a power fist.
---
I’m sure this is a noob question but what is a module? Level 80 but haven’t started to min max my character / weapons, still working on finishing the story first.
---
To jump high..
---
Yeah I love this game but stuff like this just really gets annoying at times
---
Have had this happen myself with a few different events.
---
Don’t rely on the event activating when you enter the area.
---
Use your map and activate the event by manually joining it. Haven’t had a problem with it doing it that way.
---
Meanwhile sheepsquatch is on top of me and I get a 64%
---
See, you get it
---
Also it’s a sink/bubbler and not a fountain
---
Well i finished my season run so I'm giving it couple weeks to figure itself out and decompress from whatever that legandary season thing was.  I mean I'm still logging in to collect some greens and put out fires but its more of a break that I have taken in awhile.
---
Reporting alone doesn't do anything, you need video evidence attached to a ticket, and even then it is questionable.
---
Then what fun is there in playing the way you want to play? if they dont like the stealth mechanic they should just remove it from the game, it makes no sense to instead just do this to the Daily ops.
---
Only  Bethesda
---
Great idea. Hope they won't bug out and eat our ultra rare outfits 😆
---
be bloodied

shot the first thing that vats shows you in a close fight

vats decides to target that granade over your head

Just lost 4000 S.C.O.R.E. today was playing all morning doing Meat Week cookouts supporting the community getting cool loots! and the server day rolled over at 11am CST and 5 of 7 double score dailies were auto completed no score awarded. Ticket submited but at the end it said I would not get a response for this particular ticket. I'm very disapointed in the game right now and I love it so much. Heartbroken.
---
We can use mines or grenades or melee weapons, it's reflect projectile not reflect dmg lol.
---
I just bought it today.  It is actually pretty cheap - I think around 400?
---
Oh I know. But that would require mod support. &gt;.&gt;
---
Why exactly?
---
Happened to me earlier dont know what caused it
---
Thanks for info and tip.
---
Kevin Costner joined the chat
---
I'm 2400 away from finishing. I have so many supplies saved up for atlas, so I'll need to log in a few times in the next few weeks
---
What's wrong with fast Nuke drops?  
---
Half of the fast Nuke drop can be done without the PA glitch by hacking a few doors and terminals (i.e. you can bypass fixing the reactor).  So, the design team obviously understood that some players would be willing to give up some of the XP, etc. to bypass something that they have already done enough for it to be tedious.
---
If the complaint is some players stealing a nuke launch from under another player, well this too can be done without the PA glitch, it would just be a slower burn.  
---
Again, this is something that could be fixed by coding that the event area is closed to new people entering after a certain point.
---
I could go on to infinity about how proper coding could fix a lot of grievances while leaving beneficial glitches in the game.  But it sounds like you are hung up on the player side of things, instead of where the blame really lies, on the programmers and game designers.
---
Modify
---
I'd like to know why my character is too stupid to know how to hold a meat hook while in power armor...
---
Laser is red
---
Ultracite is green
---
The damages are different
---
But both are shit
---
I was thinking maybe the bos scribe outfit? It’s got TONS of pockets. Either that or a surveyor outfit. Less pockets but it’s got a saddle bag over the shoulder. 
---
For backpacks I have the pack rat backpack. I could buy the settlers bundle to get the large settler backpack skin
---
Id love to plant some flowers too
---
If you want to run high health, look into Junkies.  It's not as OP as Bloodied is but it's still pretty powerful.
---
As for Rifles, they aren't very good for end game.  Handmades and Fixers are almost as powerful as a sniper rifle but with automatic fire.  Sniper Rifles are more powerful over distance but I have yet to see any event or Boss fight that happens over long distances.  Most are close up battles.
---
The good news is that a Commando build lends itself nicely to using Rifles when you want to.
---
I would have to look them up to know for sure. But i was thinking scribe outfit. And pack rat backpack spubds real good
---
Is tato salad and tato salad surprise different items or the same. I can't remember if I've gotten the recipes of grahm.
---
If it's a valuable item you can get the services of a Courier.  There are a couple of groups online that do this for Fallout 76.  Basically, you both give your items to the Courier and then he/she then distributes the items to each party.  Some charge a fee in CAPs, some do it for free.  
---
Most guarantee the items or their value in the case that a scam occurs.
---
Beyond third party Couriers, it's basically a game of trust where one side goes first and then the other reciprocates.  Sometimes CAPs are used as a deposit during the trade.
---
No decision Beth makes in regards to this game has made sense. They're not looking to make a fun game to play.
---
I've seen this a couple times. Seems once he's gone on a server he doesn't return
---
Unfortunate gaming
---
Tyler county grounds x3, lost home x2, willard homes x1, aaronholt hometead x3, watoga x3, deathclaw Island x1, Camden Park x2 these are my common places to start
---
Blocking has no impact on matchmaking
---
Why are their babies explosive anyway? No wonder they died out
---
Yeah I've had loads of fails creatures in the flooded train yard no way to get to it .
---
Disease cure quite common ard the game in chem / med boxes including whitespring...
---
I think that Sophia would definitely be rockin a bloodied build. She looks frail, but she's resilient, which means she has all the damage mitigation perks. Her attacks are swift, brutal, and precise (V.A.T.S.), and before you realize what happened, she's in the next room. Although, I will concede, being a Sicilian, probably prefers a weapon that allows her to get up close and personal, like a switchblade (with faster swing speed and bleed out damage). All her armor would be unyielding with reduced ap, and a healthy mix of cavalier and acrobat, because she takes no damage.
---
On the other hand, I imagine Blanche as all arms and legs (why there's no kicking in fallout, I'll never know)  probably an unarmed melee, with a bear claw, or death claw gauntlet. Alternatively, she could be an explosives build with a vampire's, or furious grenade launcher, lobbing attacks, but when they hit, they make her stronger, and deal area damage. Who knows what armor she wears, but I guarantee all 5 pieces have +1 charisma.
---
This, I also guarantee the PA guy also glitched through the silo in order to provide content for OP. Without these guys, nobody would be launching nukes.
---
I think an insignificant amount of atoms would be acceptable.  Like say 1 atom per challenge. Or mebe 5 per rank up.
---
Enough to make some opt to just buy atoms outright but still give us something to work towards and maybe not always have to buy the biggest set of atoms for that week. 
---
Tho would have to close up all the possible exploits to avoid people maxing it out in a day like last time.
---
Whats the tenderizer?
---
Neh, at the moment, already full of legendaries in stash. Unless unlimited scrips is implemented, else wats the point?
---
Best bet i guess is to run serendipidy with ricochet and rely on critical in vats
---
Damm they really going all in for this dmg nerf balance adjustment thing , call it whatever you want
---
Blame the players and not the devs. Nice.
---
Spoiling end game content? You mean you the quests don't already spoil themselves?
---
I then turn them into antibiotics after that ... with chemist two disease cures become two antibiotics, but it gives another chance for Super Duper to proc. Uses some resources like antiseptic and a stimpak, but hey I got tons of em.
---
The power armor glitch has been used since Fallout 4
---
I haven't picked up a bobble head in at least 4 days.  On a private server, none in Camden park, Tyler county, mama dolce, Bolton greens, or vault tec agricultural center.  It's too late, forget you bobble heads!
---
Loss in flux? Everytime I do the event I get the same amount with the SBQ event. Usually 2 or 3 different kinds of flux.
---
Guess so, but unfortunately that's 6 less perk coins. Already use some serendipity though, but for the most part I rely on Stealth and I was beginning to consider removing serendipity
---
but now I'll have to not only max that out, I'll have to fit in dodgy too
---
You've kind of hit on my gripe about the game. I'd like to pick and choose when to go solo vs. when to find someone to team up with, and you really can't in this game. Between how vats was redone, the need to manage *four* freaking health bars (I figured out a way that works fine if I don't care about main/side quests), armor breaking and weapons breaking, I feel like 20%-40% of the game play is me needlessly heading back to my own base to manage the character health stats, and the health stats of my character's weapons/armor.
---
At least with vats in FO4, I could determine how much damage I would do *before* activating combat with an enemy. And FO4 had a lot more minor side quests that I could do to level my character up to the point where she can go back to doing main quests (assuming I wasn't dawdling/taking my time with getting the main quest done).
---
I built my first Fo76 character in the same lacksidasial manner I used to build my FO4 characters. Found out at level 30 or 40 something that I cannot get through the main quest line like that (I am stalled out on 3 quests for that character because they all involve assultrons).
---
My new character, I am going more with an "end game" build. I tested out to see if I could reach level 20 on my own, doing the main quest lines &amp; responders quests the game gives me off the bat. The answer was: "No, not really." I wound up continuing on that dumb quest that takes you to the Top of the World to earn Rose's trust (I honestly just hate the series of quests she gives you with the various ammo and such... It feels like such a waste of time with no good end goal beyond "chaos." It's in line with her character, I just find it annoying as a gamer. I'm happier finding a character's lost kitten or helping to gather items to turn something on or shut something down, instead of trying out ammo for them).
---
I'm now off to get passcodes for Rose, so my character just turned level 18. Two more levels to go before I can finally start the main inoculation quest lines. I honestly think the main quest line is pretty much the only thing that keeps me playing. That, and I would like to drop a nuke one day.
---
The events are repetitive, and some that I do like just aren't giving me any good rewards to encourage me to keep doing them (my favourite is the one at Morgan Hospital where you kill off 5 waves of scorched and get a cargo drop). Workstations are only yours for a couple of hours, and then local monsters (NPC, not other players :)) just take them back. Even on a private server, this is still a thing. It's worse than when FO4 kept nagging at me to help defend my settlement because it's happening so frequently in the Fo76 game. It's hard to even get a quest line done before I get nagged about my stupid settlement.
---
I hate that I have to hunt around to get plans for weapons/armour. Power armor is ubiquitous and you can easily stumble upon it without searching, just by following the main/side quests the game starts you out with, and even more so when you follow random quest recommendations from the game. Meanwhile, if you like having a squishy character, hazmat suits are few and far between and they break if your character so much as sneezes.
---
What I would most like to see:
---
*More hazmat suits lying around for those of us playing squishy characters
---
*Workshops only get attacked by NPCs every 4hrs, and if you have your own private server, the harder ones to get up and functional (the power plant &amp; drill) only get attacked once a day. I don't care that much if Gorge gets taken over by mole rats, but if I ever get the power station up and running, I am going to be *pissed* when it gets taken over within 2 hrs (assuming nothing attacks while I try to make the damn thing functional again).
---
*The ability to allow other players to take over your workstation, without engaging PvP. IE: If another player wants Gorge, go for it. If they want the power plant, it's on.
---
*List the reason why someone is wanted. Sorry, I am not going to go after a level 5 character because they picked another players lock 🙄 Especially because this isn't explained *anywhere* in the game itself. I found out you get a "wanted" tag for lock picking other player's items or hitting their settlements from a reddit thread. I already knew about being wanted due to killing a character who has not fought you back. I found that out when I went to Google and wanted to figure out how to opt out of PvP gameplay (just don't fight them back, bonus if you give the confused emoji, I guess?).
---
*More durability for weapons/armor, especially if they're higher level. It makes sense for a level 1 weapon to break a ton, because you're going to level out of that rather fast. If you figure level 50 is "end game" level, then level 25  weapons/armor should be a medium between "breaks down every 20 enemies" and "Uhh... I don't remember the last time I had to repair this...I think 4 side quests and 3 events ago?"
---
*Better documentation on the perks system. The cards, while pretty, are confusing af. It's hard to figure out what I am building towards with those, unlike the chart used in FO4. If I have the same perk card maxed out twice, does my character get a stacked effect? I have no clue because the game itself doesn't tell me &amp; it wasn't worth my time to look it up/figure it out on my own.
---
*A wider variety of event types. Expand beyond just the events available now, and then shuffle them up. Maybe categorize the event types themselves: protect infrastructure (the teapot event), protect resources (the Meditation event, the event where you escort cows through Big Bend Tunnels), scavenger hunts (campfire tales event), re-build events, clear an area events (the Morgan Town airport scorched waves event, workstation events), summon something (wise mothman event), and I am blanking out on a 7th event option. Once you have categories, get 5-10 events of that category type, and assign each category a day of the week. Mondah we protect infrastructure, Tuesday we protect resources, Wednesday we go on scavenger hunts, etc. I am sure some of the events themselves will get stale, but at least you can figure out which types you prefer and thus know you're likely to join an events team who is doing the events you also enjoy. Of course no limit on Scorched Earth, since that is a player given event :)
---
*Provide more player-given quests. Without those goals/options, I don't see myself sticking around to play this game much post-storyline completion like I did with FO4.
---
Haha two shot mirv fatman go brrrr
---
clearly.
---
Nah fuck that they’ll explode in a small nuclear blast and launch the remains 75 feet in a random direction
---
Just got Vaulted so don't expect it for a few months
---
It won't! Bullplot
---
It's a lazy solution to a specific problem: allowing stealth builds under the current design would likely make these ops trivially easy. The first 3/4 of these ops is about activating objects and standing next to them: with stealth enabled you can do all that without killing a single enemy. I mean, you can already just run past enemies with a non-stealth build, but at least the enemies will attack you if while standing next to the objective. And remember that with Wastelanders Bethesda has to assume every player has access to the Chinese stealth suit.
---
What type of armor did you have? Specs type and effects. It could be glitched out atm.
---
Just a different dev under the same company
---
VATS is...odd, sometimes.  I had a thing happen yesterday where there was a Cultist a hundred feet away from me, but VATS refused to target them, instead only focusing on the two other Cultists who were a thousand feet away.  Not even switching targets in VATS, would it target that closer Cultist.  It was like he didn't exist.
---
I like that it's chaotic especially since the SBQ event is literally a cake walk compared to this. I find it refreshing that everything is dealing damage to you but that's just my opinion. I enjoy that I die from this event if that sounds odd I'm sorry but challenge in this game is pretty much non existent.
---
The huge melee weapon Grahm carries
---
Sneak will still work in most places. Except a bunch of events, and the new new new new new endgame grind event, Daily ops, where sneak is all but completely disabled. It's insane. If they dont like sneak, they should just tell us and remove it or something, not waste our time investing in the mechanic.
---
Not even Todd knows, pray.
---
I don't know. Any other shows you think would make good rp squads? When 76 was announce,I thought there'd be YouTube videos of people doing sketches, or otherwise enjoying the roleplay. Now I gotta make my own entertainment. I work overnights, and normally listen to music, but my headset is busted, and I've gotta wait 3 to 5 business days for a replacement. It leaves me alone with my thoughts too often.
---
Congrats mate! 
---
Which version of it is more valuable?
---
I call Sofia
---
ever since the last update.
---
Should also be able to heal up once per star.
---
I'm totally game for legendaries being wild card encounters that make us think fast.
---
Would cut back on people whining about them being downed so fast by bloodied players too if they were made to not go down if their 1 bar is drained too quickly.
---
Could have effects where they summon more minions, or rez / heal other enemies, or use their minions as meat shields,  or could equip them with bombs.
---
I completely understand that, but completely disabling stealth is way too far. if it did what it said I'd be alright with it. if I was auto detected within a small radius, enough that the roaming enemies would find me next to the uplink, that would be fine. I would still need to kill them all to make sure I dont get spotted and killed.
---
But as it is, I'm stuck spamming stims just so I dont die
---
If Bethesda were to do a poll, I think I honestly care less who "wins" Appalachia than I do that Graham and Chally have a nice place to rest.
---
Almost all of those prefabs have lazy collision. It is getting snapped to the bottom of the roof, instead of the ceiling. So it gets stuck in between.
---
1) build a different ceiling with correct snapping
---
2) place downward conduit
---
3) place mirror ball on the downward conduit
---
4) move both by the conduit, snap it to the prefab ceiling
---
5) mirror ball should now be low enough to see
---
No, the store won't rotate stuff.
---
But Bethesda will.
---
Good luck getting them all in one place, large at night, to eat cheesecake.
---
Maybe the handle is too small for PA hands.
---
 I'm surprised they never thought of this or maybe they have but not how to implement it without breaking players inventory which I'm sure is the main reason it's never been added. It sounds very simple on the surface but I'm sure coding that method is complex.
---
Because it's rare, needed to get legendary variants and the recent dupe wave, you'll likely be competing with people who have stockpiles of legacies and God roll weapons that they can part with easily.
---
Did anyone ever have a release date for this skin? I've been waiting for the skin to come out since it was first leaked
---
Armor doesn't change stealth like that, the problem is Beth gave all enemies in daily ops auto detection to sneak, I think there's a radius that you dont get detected, but it's like sniper range, which isn't very helpful in an enclosed space like all the daily ops
---
But for the record, its Secret service, three unyielding, two life saver. The unyielding is enough to supposedly max my stealth, but i run sneak 2 and escape artist ro be sure. 
---
I still never fell into [Caution] during my few ops
---
Damn yea I figured guess I’ll just go to the cook out another40 times
---
2021 stay tuned
---
Tap for therapy. Hold for happy endings. Double tap for Karen Gillan.
---
Probably the last week of the run
---
Yeah the exploiters are getting in my nerves lately too, had a line in the sand event earlier that was unplayable due to massive lag caused by a guy who pit his tent in the spawn point and every enemy continuously spawned together in hube middle of the event, gave me a massive headache on top of everything too
---
If you're only playing to get that dumb pennant you are missing the point.
---
It's not a problem with the barrels. It's the nozzle. Use the standered nozzle and you will be fine. I run normal flamers all the time indoors and love them
---
Maybe less so, because the events already been a couple days. You can always just post in the marketplace and see what turns up
---
I had the opposite.
---
It triggered for me and while I was looking around drumming, nobody else's showed up.
---
It also seems harder now. I could solo them on previous MW , but Now the cook meters seems to drop faster.
---
That would make sense.
---
This won't be a BIS weapon. Unfortunately, the mods cut the base damage by 50%.
---
They explode if hit or bit, so it's discourages predators.
---
As cool as this would be, you can kiss your frame rate goodbye. The game struggles rendering in stuff when you run speed demon, imagine running away from an alpha Deathclaw and it's chameleon support group. I think my PS4 would blow up.
---
But it is nice to think about.
---
Nah they're super easy to find.
---
Just run Perceptibobble constantly for a few weeks and you'll learn all the spots.
---
Can confirm, traded one for a red asylum last night. Had 3 people offer one.
---
Didn't think I'd get one, but had to try since I dropped mine on the ground and lost it haha. Was quite happy to get a new one
---
Yep.  This is a bunch of crap.  For someone like me who prefers tactical game play it is just painful to think about.  There is also that one daily ops that requires a melee attack to finish off the enemy.  Gun bash does work but running up to the enemy while using a sniper build is dumb.  It feels like they are catering to the instant gratification people who just want to run into a fight without having to think about anything.
---
They sold you power armor did you not have a chassis? It was one of the first things I got when the game first came out
---
It would be fine if we trigger them to explode by shooting them, just like literally every other mine.
---
Who's down voting this guy?
---
Please seriously look at the homogenisation of Classes within Elder Scrolls Online (another Bethesda product with more ZoS input). This is a massive trademark of theirs.
---
All of our class abilities got nerfed down into oblivion so that generic skill lines open to all classes were the only viable build. We lost all identity (hence I quit December 2019).
---
This could be a step in that direction for sure. Be very open minded to playstyles being pushed out or losing their identity.
---
Not far.  If you want to try, go for it.
---
Ah, but then they'd need to put some thought and effort into determining what that radius is - plus it's a lot easier to code "they can always see you" than "they can see you if you get x close".
---
"Lazy" is perhaps the wrong word for it. Better might "requires minimal resources", because it often feels like this game only has two interns working on it.
---
As for getting through the ops, I suggest looking into low health tank builds. Replacing some of your stealth perks with perks that increase survivability (e.g. dodgy) might help. You could also get a suit of power armor with the emergency protocols effect (or start stocking up on legendary armor that mitigates damage from robots and super mutants).
---
My suspicion is that patch 22 is going to heavily emphasize players being able to tweak their builds on a regular basis. We have the legendary perks which will give players a lot more special points to play with, and a bunch of daily ops that seem designed to make players mix things up (e.g. there's one that requires you to use a melee attack to kill enemies, and then another that freezes you if you get into melee range!).
---
Us bloodied builds are so hard done by. You can kill everything but everything can kill you.
---
My camp doesn't have any natural sources of water so when you use a clean sink to drink you spam click collect while the water is running from drinking to gather dirty water very fast.
---
Given there's only like two weeks left I believe, you'll likely only get to the 20 to 30 area I'd guess (and that's if you got all the weeklies done)
---
Lol, no.
---
Man, I was doing that op as the first one I tested and I was literally useless. I had to pull out a weight reduced, swing speed, shishkebab I use to heal npcs during events just to finish them off after the heavy builds I was running with dropped them down
---
And I was still chugging stims like candy, even with full serendipity and dodgy running. Secret service armor didn't even help me stay alive. I'm a bloodied sneaky glass canon, and this is the only place it won't work because bethesda decided Sneak builds were too op even after the damage nerfing
---
Yep, this would be more like it 👍
---
Having some enemies with high perception would be good for  a bit of challenge but not all of them.  Making stealth completely useless is just ridiculous.
---
I don’t think a gulpers gonna mind if the egg scrambles itself
---
Probably not even that honestly, it really requires a decent amount of play to proceed
---
You can only craft it while inside the Crater Core.
---
Person once used a power armor glitch to get into my camps vendor room through the back to avoid going through the elaborate silent hill experience I created.  
---
So I immediately jumped servers before they could buy a single thing thus wasting their time and caps due to impatience.
---
People are bored of it already.    
---
I went at 9 p.m. my time and was alone the entire time. Prime Cuts hit and I didn't see anyone go to them.
---
Scrap it.  Burn it with FIRE
---
Don't do this. Save it for your mule account.
---
They could just add perception to the enemies like they said they did. Or hell maybe that IS what they did, but they added 100 rather than 10. it's not too hard for them to balance sneak a little back for the Ops. And regardless, forcing us to swap builds all the time, literally daily for the ops, is completely counter intuitive to the Legendary card system, where we need to scrap every card we arent always using, just to get another rank on those cards
---
so many things are working against each other with this update it's incredibly complicated and stressful and simply annoying
---
Idk treat it like double the price of a nice fixer.
---
For the plan ?
---
all jangles must be destroyed.
---
Most players already have everything they need. If you want to dispense aid before a fight, expect players to completely ignore your bag of stims.
---
Here's a thing about tato salad -- I am a carnivore and this is clearly a veg recipe.. so why does it give me the extra health on my status page? Is it actually working? I have the recipe but don't know whether to trade it or learn it as it feels like I shouldn't be able to use it. Does anyone know??
---
I agree.    
---
Over the last 3 months I can't recall the number of times an enemy would ragdoll who knows where or the force if the dying hit would knock it through the game world; ground or wall.
---
I just take off the long barrel and put it back on, seems to fix it until i leave the server.
---
Wendigos
---
They broke it while adding the new Grelok Cackle emote that hadn't hit the shop yet.
---
It's convenient, and it's an agreement, but I think a glitch will be created if the post specifications are installed. I can't trust Bethesda.
---
Well you want a fight group of 4,  have to all be humans,  hmmm,  can’t be ninja turtles,  idk man. You could always rolplay as the ghostbusters with a team of three, I have better video game crossover ideas,  what about like the 4 characters from L4D2 or even better the original 4 characters from WaW Nazi zombies. xD. They just got launched forward in time again.
---
I'm a bloodied stealth commando and i do just fine in there by swapping some perks in my build. The reason for the mutations on daily ops is just that.. To make people think differently and alter their tactics.
---
This person gets it, the rest, well yo are taking this too seriously.
---
Just spent a few mins crunching some numbers and came up with about 25 levels too, inc weeklys. Level 28 is a T51 power armor paint, level 25 is the UFO jungle gym, level 19 is the Glow In The Dark Wallpaper
---
I'm not big on cosmetics but I did use the ones for the CAMP.    
---
I got the Chally costume and mask and put them both in my vendor. I got the grill but haven't made one yet. I think I got two of the mods for the Tendorizer but neither the weapon or the plan for it.
---
War Glaive mods at Regs for players who want to use a shitty weapon.
---
Yeah I guess at least that's good to know for the free range event. Smacking the Brahmin with the shish kabob takes forever.
---
Thanks for the advice! Dumb question--what's a quad lever action? Is that different than the regular lever action?
---
If you're not bloodied, you're not end game. Accept that and use proper gear to fight the end game boss.
---
This is exactly why I traded so much for my VE90 plasma the other day. ;)
---
They hate rifle users.  Heavy Gunner, Shotgun and Melee can easily switch perks around for that.  Possibly Pistols have room for Strength perks but not sure.  Most rifle users I know of run with low Strength and have to be carried through that op or are just screwed in solo.
---
Yeah and also it's the ones that are the same day to day for me like buy 3 items. It's clearly a tricky thing for the game to handle when it flips over to a new one but oh wait isn't that one ticked off? Yeah must be let's tick it again.
---
Took me 54 days
---
I cant be bothered with that haha. I just deal without the extra bit of damage
---
This only works well for people that can only play on the weekends. Waiting a day for my scrip limit to reset is difficult, I cant imagine waiting a week for it.
---
Stealth is still completely useless, I understand that you can swap perks around to make yourself more survivable 
---
And really, I'd be fine with it, if that mutation wasn't active for every single daily op. It's a permanent mutation for every day. meaning stealth never works for the Ops
---
He is a BOS roleplayer, what did you expect? xD
---
Understandable because Vampire seems like a real strong prefix for this fight especially a weapon that can rain down suppressive fire like an explosive gatling plasma
---
It’s a good question. So quad is a legendary affect, it causes the gun to hold more ammo before reloading. Combine that with speed demon to reload quicker, and you can knock down groups easier as a single shot focused build
---
Yeah that was stupid. Idk
---
Idk what good fixers or anything goes for but I’d be willing to pay 20k caps maybe 30k I’m not a two handed melee build but my hope would be to get the plan and eventually find a good one then make a build for it
---
Yep,  I’m here on Xbox still waiting for the update,  real excited for it,  the biggest thing is I’ll want to run full health though and miss out on that juicy +15 Intel from an Unyielding set.
---
Flawless
---
What system are you on. Because I can hook you up
---
Thank you
---
I have a rather large camp with 2 sides separated by a cliff, Sophia once wound up on the lower side and was desperately trying to get back to her station.
---
  
---
she'd have to path outside of the camps sphere to do so tho, so she kept stopping half way up the cliff and running all the way back around to the other side in a mad panic. XD
---
She did that for like 5 minutes before she remembered she could teleport.
---
I’m on Xbox, I probably should have stated that lol
---
That’s not really a big deal when you’re doing something like that, now if only we could transfer items like in eso
---
I want one with Todd Howard head on the back with the text "FO:NV wasn't that great".
---
Is it just the Standard Nozzle that you use or the Compression Nozzle?
---
Even the red rocket sign?
---
Haha
---
Yep, I was straight up useless with Resilient active, there should be no possibility that completely and entirely destroys a build for the event. Being stuck with a crappy Shishkebab was absolutely horrid, could barely stay alive.
---
1st no one is gonna ignore free stims lol 2nd I think you are missing the whole point of my post. 3rd if most players had everything they need there would be as big as a trading community that we have now. And yes people still look and want to trade for even the most common and mundane items.
---
Made a post about this a while back I completely agree
---
The standered. Havnt tried with the compression
---
Do you know how long they typically go out for tho?
---
So they usually drop items in and out of rotation?
---
I know nobody is going to believe me but I got it in the first try with a Level 21 caracter, i though they have increase the chance of getting one
---
+ wearing a clown outfit spamming emotes.
---
Someone left a 3* life saving metal arm, with generate stealth field, and reduce weapon weights by 20% on the floor in my camp.  The rest of my armor is assorted combat armor, but that arm was too nice to sell.
---
I agree but theres always leftovers after every bbq and all the meat is gone. get real.
---
Dang. Well good luck fellow vault dweller
---
Happy cake day, wear a Party Hat
---
I am only playing to get it because free stuff. Plus I'm not really into waves of enemies endlessly coming at me. Just not my thing.
---
You know what’s even better,  that stacks and HTD armor pieces don’t lmao.
---
I just had my first fail at an event, there were four of us, two afk on the drums (which i normally don't mind), and me and the other guy running around doing everything and very slowly filling the bar... until the other guy just gave up, so the event failed.
---
Thanks other guy, we would of at least hit tier one, and got *something* for our effort. Asshole.
---
It is not a matter of if we hit the leather donation goal or not since the devs will make us pass the goal by either lowing the requirement as they did with Concrete or help fill up the requirement like they might have done with Cork.
---
Vault 94 armor,vault 94 power armor aka straggler heart power armor,secret service armor,gauss shotgun,gaus minigun,gauss pistol,thats all I think 😁
---
Yep
---
No I'm good just move the vendors please Karen.
---
This is why the BSSS bear arm went on the trade list and the BSSS ski sword didn’t.  Lmao,  idk seems fair considering how good unarmed can be.
---
It got cut cut cut
---
Sorry, didn't see you there, you are absolutely right. 😂
---
No, once items have been added to the atomic shop, they are flipped on server side by Beth. There's no way to data mine that without an employee leaking rotations
---
If you start now, you will definitely get rank 100
---
Considering how rarely I feel the need to do a non-marsupial jump i think the better solution would be a half-lifeish style crouch jump (iirc ctrl+space) on PC.
---
Much better than having to hold space just to do what i consider my normal jump height, and even better that the double to jump jetpack nonsense.
---
That said... There are much bigger issues with this game I would rather be focused on.
---
I just take a picture of 
---
- Waster 01
---
- waster 02
---
Etc, in neon signs on black surface
---
Bethesda wont do this because they suck
---
Well how about adapting? If you can't play with 20% standing on a fence like a coward, use radaway and play with 50% or more and fight. A build isn't set to stone you know?
---
Besides nothing is balanced, its pathetic to say bloodied should get buffed in any way just because you are unable to play the game in its basics mechanics like managing healthpoints or dealing abit less damage then the absolute maximum.
---
that’s how we got corona dude
---
After suggesting it I even thought holding it for normal jump would make more sense (im on xbox).
---
Yeah 100% a small priority. But seems fairly simple and I wanted to put the idea out there.
---
Stop trying to find matches at 2am on a monday
---
stealth rifleman here also. def recommend taking off scrapper and your picklocks and just switching them on whenever you need them. i'd invest in: adrenaline, gun fu, gunslinger if you run non-auto, and/or demolition if your guns are explosive. if you have bandolier (which you do), or batteries included and don't use energy ammo much, might want to look into moving points off strong back and either searching for 90%rw weapons or just being selective about which you carry on you. i was hesitant to ditch strong back, but once i did, it opened up a lot of option for me. 
---
things you have that I'd consider lessening or dropping altogether from active perks to free up points to move around: strong back, sturdy frame (esp if you use the stealth suit a lot), martial artist, the picklocks, lead belly if you have the decontamination shower, aquaboy/girl if you use the stealth suit, and scrapper
---
I agree that it should be doable in most games, but the engine Bethesda is using for Fallout 76 is such a patchwork at this point that it might be extremely difficult to make something like this work. The standard trading mechanisms we have basically just work like a vendor which is easy to implement, but there has never been a game built in this engine where trading items for another item and making sure both recipients receive said item has ever been done. This engine can't even have functioning real time ladders. The limitations they have to work around might make it nearly or completely impossible to implement this.
---
I believe the achievement is there to track your  hours in the game more than for those atoms
---
Nothing bugged, you just dont hit the 1k damage softcap.
---
By the way, I checked tonight and sorting the notes tab by either value or weight puts plans and recipes near the top.  So that's something I'll do every time I start the game, just like I sort my aid by spoil.
---
Just happened to me, too. Pretty sure this is a new bug because my first character went Foundation, saved her mom, and then Jen had the correct dialogue at the end. Still annoying though; this is supposed to be my best character and I got a shitty ending. :(
---
You use them to craft legendary weapons/armor you unlock through the wastelanders storyline. It's 2 modules for weapons and 1 for armor iirc, but each module costs 50 scrip.
---
You do not want to play this game with a vehicle. Just watch how terrible fallout 4 mods handle it on a basically flat map.
---
Skyrim horses were jankey enough. I'd be surprised if they return in TES6 if it uses the same animation rig
---
I have a Nuka Cola/Red Rocket bar and then built my secret communist spy bedroom above the bar behind a hidden Nuka Cola door. Could do something similar since the nuka cola door is always available i think.
---
What kind of power armor skins/outfits? I know about the BoS Spec Ops outfit.
---
Fuck me man, you’re right.
---
Also some mods for the guitar sword.
---
I want one with the number 16, for 16 times the detail.
---
How long has the community been asking for them to fix VATS? 
---
So many 95% head shots missed and they rather take away the ability to make double walls...
---
Wait, it lights up? How 🤭
---
I think you should be able to use legendary modules to roll whatever you know the plans for. Why should any other weapon or armor be special.
---
In my eyes you can do the fight while in the unyielding effect you just have to have a good vampire weapon to stay on full health.
---
Well ESO is built on a modern engine, they don't have nearly as many limitations blocking development. I am honestly impressed with how much they have done with this game as is lol. It is significantly better that it was at launch. Yet there are still so many problems, some of them present since launch even haha. I recently started up the PC side of the game because a buddy wanted to try it. I played a lot on xbox because I had friends playing over there. The game is much nicer to play on a PC :)
---
They're both honeypots for noobs.
---
The only SS piece you want is a torso with the jet pack.
---
All that extra DR is redundant because npcs hit for tickle damage.
---
Wait till they randomly start moving around your camp.
---
Hey mate, are you using the future tec camp skin from the legendary run? Thats what is causing your problem, removing the skin and then re-placing your base should solve the issue. Its a fairly well documented issue at this point and is due to be fixed in the next update on consoles. Its supposed to be fixed on PC right now, but I'm finding that it still has issues.
---
Toxic
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
For compression i notice its halfway. A bit more damage but less range than standard not as bad as Vapo nozzle though
---
That mail vendor from Destiny as well
---
What do you mean stealth boosts are forfeit?
---
It would be fine if they added like 10 PER to the enemy stats, so if you move at all, or if you're within 10-20 meters you're stuck in \[Caution\] But they should not be able to always see you by simply being in the same room or cell
---
Yeah I’ve been running with mine bloodied for the xp of late but it definitely isn’t preferable.  I did rock myself on a cave cricket earlier.  IDK, I’ll personally
---
Probably just run full health in power armor,  I really just don’t want to risk dying in the event at all.  I’ve heard about the respawn bug..
---
Contrary to unpopular belief, there is no consequence to having afk players at any event.
---
How is it less flexible? If anything it's more flexible. If everything resets at a consistent time then it doesn't matter when in the day you turn it is as long as its before that reset. Whereas with the current system you'd need to plan your sleep/work schedule around it if you decided to maximize resets for more than a few days.
---
As for the loss of the 8th reset, most people can't schedule the time for it anyway. For those that care about it you could easily distribute the lost scrips and bullion across the rest of the week, double up a day, or spread across the weekend.
---
Trade. Changed the game for me completely.
---
Upon the event beginning you are automatically detected and go into Danger. Sometimes I got caution, but mostly I remain in Danger and therefore no sneak attacks can happen.
---
Herbivores want Commie running Proletariat.
---
Just do primal cuts a few times a lot this week. I’m sitting at 100+ notes just from primal cuts alone this week
---
me! i hate nw, so skipped those dailies entirely. glad to have had something to do, but also glad be done, especially with having to level up every dang day.
---
Re-enacting the Super Stimpack assassination technique.
---
Where is his static location?
---
You sound like a COMMUNIST!
---
Yeah, his glossy, stearing eyes are a nightmare fuel.
---
I have enough treasury notes, I’m saying I want to be able to cash them all in at once
---
Exactly. Plus almost every time this gets brought up people accuse you of wanting the reset acclimated to your timezone. Which imo I don't care if it's 1pm or 6am, just consistently would be nice.
---
Not to prevent, it's a bug.
---
There is no “bloodied Gatling laser nerf”
---
There is a general rebalance of ALL DAMAGE CALCULATION 
---
And even after that, bloodied is STILL better than everything else
---
Stop whining
---
Some of its luck, but mostly due to dupers
---
The raiders, overseer, and settlers reset at 8pm or they did at one point. That would be cool but at the same time what if you don’t make it to that 8pm time because I didn’t get on till later then usual then I’d be upset I didn’t turn things in or what if you live in Europe or something. I think that’s why things are set on a player timer. I think it would be cool if I could go in my pipboy and see how long I have till I can get my caps, gold, and script for my characters I mean it has to be in there somewhere for it to know when it’s gonna reset how hard would it be to let me see that lol
---
Trading with dupers
---
If you call 4 Flux a "shit ton", you probably don't use it for anything anyways.
---
I finished it yesterday thankfully. I was well and truly over it by the end and looking forward to a break before the next one. I hope they make it less grindy next time.
---
How did you die in tutorial country?
---
Why do you care? Be happy you sold them for the price you wanted. End of story
---
Ah yeah. If anything they could at the very least give us a weekly cap instead of daily. That way for people who can’t play every day of the week could still get the max GB for that week. But I do understand where you are coming from. The caps in this game are so bad and hurt the “economy” (if you could say that).
---
I used to worry about stuff like this, then I realised "hey I've got my caps so why worry what other people are doing?"
---
For me it's mostly busted in the Ash Heap and a couple times in the Bog. Others report different. I've never failed in the Forest or Toxic Valley due to bugs. I feel it's luck whether you get a completion or not.
---
Breaking character,  it lights up with your pip boy.
---
Hmm I did just get the communist bundle
---
I might be off in outerspace with this but I always assumed that this was on purpose. It's read about the radtoads that they send off their offspring to act as 'decoys' when they're under attack. What's a better decoy then for your VATs to lock onto the litter buggers while its momma lick attacks you?
---
I have a screen shot of my vendors prices and items. If someone does the suspect buy I leg it to a stash box and pull the whole lot out. Sharing is caring. There is no need to horde to resell by wiping out another player. It is a dick move. Good luck trying to resell my ultracite plans for 500caps and up each. There is a reason they are so cheap. On the upside more room in my stash.
---
As if the engine can handle that. It would shit itself trying.
---
God roll Bolstering is what you use until you get a 1* unyielding piece in that slot.
---
It’s not even the economy it’s the experience IMO
---
Nah. There's bugs and there's "This shit won't run on last gen consoles." They're trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole.
---
Those are the Creature Attractant/Repellant plans from Arktos. They're not real plans.
---
That's usually what happens to me too, paid 10k c
---
I didn't want to sell them that that cheap though I was just tired of having them take up space in my stash. I was hoping someone who missed out on faschnaut or had been looking for a specific one would buy buy one, not have someone buy all of them at once and resell them for stupid high prices.
---
The real endgame is stash management because it’s nothing but repair kits.
---
My question is, if a vending machine is destroyed do I have to restock it all over? 
---
I've never lost one totally, but I know trolls can damage your stuff without PvP occurring and it'd be a bastard to re list it all.
---
I put 2 clips into erle and spend the rest of the fight taking out the ads chasing everyone around. You can stay in stealth pretty easy and avoid the screech.
---
You’re making an unfair comparison. Obtaining T-65 or SS armor isn’t akin to dismantling blues or opening engrams. It’s more akin to raid drops. You can’t run the destiny raids multiple times day everyday of the week. You get one run a week. Destiny (and any loot based mmo) limits your ability to get what you want. Sometimes it’s time restrictions (WoW, Destiny) and sometimes it’s ridiculous RNG odds (Borderlands, Diablo)
---
Also very true, I understand the devs thinking I guess... they WANT you to login daily and maybe get hooked into something (friends or event), but being on for a few hours (if that) and getting my scrip cap then having no room in my stash for excess scrip items, max caps cap, and already turned in my 20 notes for the day... 
---
I mean you want me to get on daily, but you give me maybe 1 hour of play time before I’m done for the day.
---
80% reduced damage for a weapon that requires fluxes to craft ammo for it, and is out then dpsed by baseball bats, hes not whining. Youre just being an ass
---
Someone had to eat the bat so we could correct the population issues.
---
Sorry I am not sorry I became patient zero.
---
I bought that crap too. Time to request a refund I think.
---
I'm aware of that...
---
But some are more hit than others...
---
Grinding, luck, and trading.
---
You will not make it at this point unless you do all of the dailies / weeklies and then also grind out like 10,000,000 XP
---
Yes, just wait and the thing you want might come back with a discount.
---
Downvoting me doesn’t invalidate the facts
---
Usually what happens to me too, paid 10k caps for the blue ridge caravan backpack back when I was grinding for it and got it the next time I ran the event, then the same thing happened with the chally backpack, luckily I got my tenderizer plan last night.
---
Cry more. 
---
BTW, capturing workshops for fusion cores is still a thing. So are player vendor machines. 
---
You also still get fusion cores when you craft a  Gatling laser and super duper works on that too. 
---
It just seems to me that you rather spend time complaining than actually learning how to play.
---
Common Outfits should become Plans, while Rare Outfits should still be singular and be stackable. I recently threw away all of the commons i had stashed and my stash is still laggy, i need to clear out all of the notes and holo and all of the plans as well.
---
Alts.
---
That’s been happening to me too.
---
The air makes them lighter they are bloated after all. But I agree two wacks from a ghoul and I'm dead
---
Yeah same thing happened when I wanted fixer plan. Everyone wanted 15k for it but I found someone for 5k next event I got it and just again tonight I got it. I have gotten it 5 times since I bought it. Lucky that I only gave a fixer plan for the tenderizer. I see ppl asking for legacies. I still need the one mod but I’m not as worried about that.
---
Well the first try I died 2 times and didnt run into the respawn bug so I got lucky I guess.
---
Sleep well, my friend because you have had a glimpse into oblivion.
---
Hahaha!!! You stupid. Can’t even understand you’re the Karen in this scenario.
---
Nothing but normal headlamp sadly.
---
Yeah but the thing is on my first event there were sooo many wendigos that I thought they messed up the spawnrate of them... Good thing is that they still havent fixed "magic" weapons so I can just melt Earle woth my minigun whenever I want the fight to end.
---
im starting to research and learn where the possible spawn locations are in all the locations around my CAMP and the places i visit the most. Just look up the wiki for the locations around your CAMP and see which ones have Spawn locations and travel there to check. Its also a very decent way to make a few extra caps, i usually sell them for 176 in my Vending and they sell quite abit.
---
Well that was a good fail there. Can you just let the real vets having a debate here plz. We don't need hate over here. Thank you.
---
$12.99 a month*
---
And 1st doesnt actually help a lot with stash space, it only helps with scraps that already barely weigh anything. Speaking from experience.
---
If the storage space issue is a deal breaker for you, thats cool and I empathize, but don’t just make shit up.
---
We get rework and also they just buff flat damage for alien blaster ... maybe but maybe we should wait for a bit and see what type of buff we are gonna get weapon itself right , after all this is what pts stands for ... right guys ?
---
Yep sounds right.
---
Trust me. Even with fo1st its still a problem.
---
Clench your butt cheeks as Purveyor Mmrgh fleeces you of thousands of scrip.
---
She did one day give me my Fixer and a solid Handmade though.
---
Yes, I’m on PC and the skin works perfectly for me
---
“Real vets” AGAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Good one
---
And by “having a debate” you mean whining and complaining like 3y olds?
---
Official Bethesda forums are THAT -&gt; way and the proper channel to give PTS feedback. No here.
---
Funny you posted this before even getting downvoted. 
---
Also, insulting me in direct/private message ain’t gonna work
---
Oh BTW: I am on the PTS and you need to get a fucking clue and l2play
---
If you can, make your junk into bulk if you haven’t done so, cuts down on weight. Also go through your stash and take out all the non legendary gear you don’t need, I personally sell all my 1 star weapons and armor to vendors and get plans with the caps I get from them, then I put the other armor in my vendors to sell, usually people buy it for scrip so I usually price them low, that’s how I kept my stash box under the max weight but I caved in and got fallout 1st Bc of the private world lmao.
---
Play another game. Seriously, don't force it or you'll burn out quickly.
---
Bethesda have already addressed the matter of damage changes stating the new system makes the numbers more manageable. It really doesn't need another whiney post on the subject.
---
It does, I had it on xbox before I went to PC. Never had an issue with space. It sounds like you have bad space management and I empathize, but just don't make shit up.
---
Complete Graham Cookout then craft at Tinkers Bench
---
Tried to trade a fixer plan for it yesterday 1:1 and was told I'd need to offer more as "people are trading legacies for it". Depending on which mod you need I might be able to give it to you if you're on ps4. Think I've got an extra salty and peppered.
---
I'm a first member with resting STASH at 330lbs so..... Keep what's actually important.
---
I like the idea of having to alter tactics, challenge is good. I am fine with making myself less of a glass cannon.  I am even fine with having to equip all of the Stealth perks and maybe more stealth gear to lessen detection.  What I am not fine with is essentially being forced to Leeroy Jenkins the damn thing.  If they made some of these ops where Stealth builds were useless it would be fine, just not all of them.
---
Now that I think about it, they should add some where a rifle of some sort is required to finish off the enemies.  Or explosives. Would be fair for all. :)
---
If no one does it by tomorrow I’ll help out
---
The irony being called a griefer on a post where you are asking "How to destroy someone's camp" haha
---
A friend of mine is using it and occasionally when she spawns into a server her CAMP icon is white so noone can fast travel to it, she can travel to it fine though. It doesn't always happen, may not even be related to the CAMP skin anymore, I dunno.
---
I've recently started doing the same - selling my 1 star gear to vendors but I still have way too much gear clouding my stash. It's frustrating for sure
---
Anyone who replies to anything on the internet with a ?!? Is 100% a triggered Karen in the real world.
---
This is a point of tension for many players, definitely. Resource management is a huge part of this game: keeping acid and ores is lighter than storing metal scrap, players usually settle on keeping either 50 or 100 pieces of whatever scrap they use most often (aluminum, ballistic fiber, plastic, rubber...), and having a spare character to hold onto long-term storage could also free some space
---
Make a mule
---
It's tough as a fresh 50 who needs tons of caps/scrip for his build
---
Yeah that happens to me as well but I don’t know if the skin is actually the cause
---
How many mods come with it? I got the peppered and of course just did event again and got another chally outfit lol. I should’ve never bought it from atom shop. But yeah that’s why I am lucky. Dude messaged me and said you still need it I said yup and then I see post about what all ppl want for it. I’m sorry I get ppl want it but I’m not going to give every gun I own just for it. I don’t even have legacies so when I see posts for them I just keep on scrolling. I get told every time I post looking for a trade that my stuff isn’t enough. Lol I guess we can’t trade unless we have legacies
---
I was thinking I may have to just have a set number of each material. It's frustrating because I want to keep all my legendaries for scrip right now because I need weapons and armor for my build
---
I wish.  I just use the tv's mute button.   I can't handle it.   If I don't hear a scorch sneaking up on me, then I don't hear them.   I'd rather die and reload than listen to that crap.
---
I want to, I just don't know anyone who plays who could help me move things between characters
---
You’re the one bitching about how inconvenient your life is because of someone else’s mundane actions. Literally the definition of “Karen” and your continued arguing how you’re not is a textbook Karen response. Please don’t call 911 on me!! ?!?
---
Oh and for good measure, you can't triple stamp a double stamp.
---
I traded for almost all of my stuff, I’d be rocking some dogshit mutants armor and a shish-kabob if I relied on drops to get gear.
---
Nope. 
---
Two reasons: engine isn't capable of vehicles in any way, also the devs aren't even capable of building functional ladders which were done within 10mins by a modder which are also not really capable of  modding moving vehicles the last 4 years now in fallout 4 (ehich is literally the same game as fallout76 is).
---
Yeah, this is what i'm telling to my self. It has to be a rough, a pretty basic, rework of their formula. There's no way they can't be aware that mostly broken for the most part. They definitly need to work on some balance there.
---
Calm down Karen its going to be okay.  Just relax princess you'll get through this.
---
Roll a D20, multiply that by the answer on a magic 8-ball, then divide that by Todd's current mood. when you have your answer then it might be back in the shop.
---
Since im feeling generous, skipp to 8:25 and youll see for yourself https://youtu.be/pDnqYDoYkbQ. Gat plasma nerfed into uselessness as well
---
The troll in you is strong. Again you’re the one being a little bitch. Time for you to take a nap.
---
How about having a bit of self control and accountability. Works wonders for this issue.
---
I'm on xbox and the framerate has been so bad the last two days that the game is practically unplayable.
---
There are three mods available for it, salty, spicy and peppered. I'm more or less in the same boat as you on legacies, I have one (QE harpoon) but there's no way I'm giving it up for a weapon plan that means I MIGHT someday get a legendary one.
---
Ok Karen whatever you say.
---
I've had Daguerre spawn in nude while standing in place not moving at all and staring at me menacingly.
---
If they had a "quick match" option where the map and your spawn point is randomly selected and as soon as they get a full game it just starts, with one loading screen, I might play it more. I just want to hide in a bush and watch people run around shooting each other.
---
Don't forget the unlootable enemys at scorched earth! Or in some cases a 100% game crash once the sbq died...
---
Earlier today I had 6 AFKers on the drums and spits from the jump. Me and one other person, with no prime cuts, knocked it out in three minutes flat cleaning up trash, putting out fires, harvesting greens and critters, and scooping shit.
---
I'm a fan of AFKers on drums and spits. Two thumbs up.
---
Supposedly they recently turned it into a “no camp” zone, indicating that they are going to add something to the location. That may involve the vault door, so perhaps they messed up while changing it from a fixed asset into a movable one.

I dont have to use 1st and i ger by with my 1 character
---
I use random world containers with no limit. Just find an obscure container nobody will notice, drop what you want to move in it, then load your mule back in on the same server and pick it up.
---
I have this problem because I have over 200lbs in flux and over 500lbs of junk don’t wanna drop it if I got F1st I would have so much room but I ain’t paying $130 a month to get unlimited junk storage
---
I could see that. I scrip daily too. It's more OCD as I hate messy inventory. If I don't use it daily it's Scrip'd scrapped or sold.
---
This needs to be elevated to the top, bravo
---
Caps, weapons, ammo and outstanding armour are all possible rewards.  I think the group sometimes give the bounty, but at other times, the person who wants justice ponies up the reward.
---
Sounds like you're pissed he may get more from them or has the stash space to leave them in. 500 sounds perfectly reasonable for a mask. Maybe they don't sell but what's it to you? I like to tier my masks and stuff and keep them all there in plain sight it's a good incentive to people to make them buy... oh shit if I don't grab this now next time it will be double the price etc.
---
e.g.
---
Treasure hunter outfit: 500
---
Treasure hunter outfit: 1000
---
Treasure hunter outfit: 2000
---
I regularly sell the 500 and 1000 ones and sometimes I put them back in, sometimes I leave it for a bit. Good way to gauge what goes for what. Especially if it's stuff that is rare and you won't be able to get for another year like F. masks it seems to do fine.  Going to be so many crazy high disco balls in my vendor going forward :)
---
innosurvivalist? really? xDDD 
---
the one who releasses videos 2 days after everyone else, doesn't do ANY research on her own and only copies stuff from others and STILL gets most of her info wrong?
---
thats the one video you chose to link? 
---
do you have a REAL concern with heavy energy weapon damage? go to the official PTS forums and do proper feedback. 
---
posting here WHINING about it won't do jack shit
---
you did get into the PTS to help and give feedback, right? or are you one of those kids that just went to the PTS to feel cool?
---
Is it rare?
---
Got mine at lost home today
---
Dear Mark Miller, I am the RACK, deep strike into enemy territory.
---
It would not be a surprise if the house if full with hentai porn.
---
It's enough to make you pvp.   Screw losing the wanted caps.
---
Unfortunately, you can still get then: I got parasites from my sink on Friday.
---
Oh you like radtoad eggs, here is a radtoad egg plushie for only 1500 atoms!
---
So you ignore the data, then deflect to a character attack on the content creator. 
---
Sooo you know youre still wrong, right? I mean side by side comparison. Clear as day.
---
The thing is they wont resell at those prices. They will either reduce them themselves or dump them at a train station because no one is buying them at any price really. I had mine dirt cheap and ended up taking all but about 2 of ea type (not the rare ones) to the nearest trainstation an dleaving them in a suitcase. I got sick of them taking up space. I may yet ditch the rest I kept too.
---
I finished the Run yesterday and couldnt even put the gameboard up because it sunk into every wall I tried it on. I dont know how they mess shit up that was working before by adding unrelated content. Its a talent they have in spades though :/
---
It really is, they are just standing there doing absolutely nothing and we didn’t even get the full rewards so they pretty much got nothing good too, all it would’ve taken is those leathers taking 5 seconds to jump on the barrels and spits and it would’ve gotten done so quick
---
Finished today also. Dobby is free!
---
Thanks for the info mate, I can stop trying to make a legendary fixer 🤓
---
Which food recipe is this?
---
Im actually wondering if they were on the spits etc and someone has taken it upon themselves to kill them in between events and thats where they respawned
---
It shouldn't automatically go into inventory because it sucks being forced into being encumbered. Not all legendaries are worth picking up.
---
Are you doing collect or drink
---
Man, regardless of where I'll end up finding one - THANKS FOR THE REMINDER! I was dicking around for like 6 hours doing dailies, fiddling with my camp, and by the end of it all I totally forgot I still had that daily to complete. So, again: thank you!
---
What level are they?
---
i relay on data from better content creators that actually did the research on their own rather than making a video about something they read on reddit or discord, like she does.
---
also, funny how you missed the ACTUAL DATA and damage numbers on her video... she sais the damage went down from 300 to 80 and then you see her footage and it's actually not like that at all.
---
and you know why? because she FAILED to mention something very important: that after armor and resistances applied, the difference is not 80% but more like 40% which ALL BLOODIED WEAPONS DESERVED ANYWAYS
---
oh, i also would love to see her (and yours for that matter) perk build, because it's probably so bad and wrong that it's no wonder you can't kill shit without an OP weapon
---
so get a freaking clue and welcome to the world of "non bloodied build players" and SUCK IT UP
---
And shepherd crook I believe
---
Id rather be over encumbered than potentially miss out on a b2525 handmade
---
Bought the plan for 5k today.
---
I've got 
---
4 gatling plasma 2 furious 1 bloody 1 anti armour
---
Furious ffr .50cal
---
Anti armour gatling gun
---
Troubleshooters explosive lmg and ghoul slayers explosive lmg
---
I'm going to prime one of the gatling plasmas for a bit of extra damage as I have 160 ultracite plasma cores
---
The gatling gun was given to me the rest i got from enemies or the purveyor
---
I’m so jealous of you pc folks, I want to try the event so bad😭
---
From 400 to sub 100 damage, did you graduate highschool?
---
Just no. My squad has 4ppl over level 1000, one reskilled alot and don't have any perkpoints left, the others are struggling to save up for the coming legendary perks where you have to spend insane amounts of perkpoints to level up each individual legendary perk. 
---
Do you know how hard it is to level up above level 750?
---
100% along with the display
---
Press F to doubt.
---
I'm not sure but the turrets might stagger the SBQ and prevent her from landing. Also the position of your camp might have been bad so that she doesn't have enough room to land. 
---
I've seen camps that are Scorchbeast fighting platforms so that they can land on it and they don't have turrets.
---
Same, I hadn't noticed it until I sat down for a full day of 76. 
---
It happened on a cultist as well, but also a super mutant unfortunately can't remember what type. Was at grafton steel
---
Well the progress was going down way too fast for the spits and dumps to be getting used in my game
---
Brown chicken brown cow
---
Yeah turning off grass is great and all but for console players that’s not an option...
---
Unyielding thorn armor is literally the best option. No need for additional sneak buffs like the perk card or chameleon. There is a limit for sneak to get undetected for enemys, which is reached with a full set of thorn armor. Add a nice fixer, hope for some ap regen proccs and your good to go!
---
The fact that he can kill Earle by himself says another about the state of balance.
---
then go to the bethesda forums and do some ACTUAL feedback
---
the formula is FINAL. it's clear you have no idea what they changed. they went from multiplication to addition. which every single freaking MMO out there has been doing for years, because it's the proper way for damage calculation.
---
this will make future changes (more nerfs or buffs) much easier.
---
yes, they might buff energy weapons a bit later on, but bloodied will have it's damage reduced because IT WAS 200% BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
---
get used to it
---

Right. Which is why afk'ers on the drum and spits are actually hugely helpful in the event very few other turn up. While they are doing that the bar doesnt plummet and its far more doable to get the event done. There are people who just like to get butthurt over afk'ing. And I get it for events like Fasnacht but this one is different.
---
I think 9 people afk'ing and none of them are on the drums/spits is highly unusual which is why I think they would have originally been on those things but for "reasons" ended up respawning off them
---
Really want the Gauss shotty
---
Really want the Gauss Shotty!
---
I’m almost there, but well done you! 👍🏼
---
My strategy for levelling has been to make a new character each Tuesday to cover the daily level up and weekly three times.. getting bored of this now tho!
---
Tbh, I’ve actually enjoyed logging in for the daily’s and found it quite addictive. 
---
Despite people saying to log off before daily reset to avoid the auto complete bug, I actually watch yesterday’s tasks disappear and the new ones appear one by one.. seems fine. 👍🏼
---
I always thought this too, as well as probably most of the community. But to Bethesda it's just buisness; and to the community it's aggravation.
---
Back in the early days Bethesda fixed a bug where you were able to carry unlimited amounts of items. On Patchday all train stations suitcases were filled with thousands of stimpaks, chems,  food, water, tons of junk and so on, literally everything dupers had duped. Some items were such large stacks we couldn't even pick them up (like 6k stims where we couldn't even pick up one of the stack).
---
You could do mutant ninjas, but they wouldn't necessarily be turtles. Like, if you had 4 chally outfits, they could be teenage mutant ninja moomoos. It's a challenge, because they're all melee builds. Note: I've never read the comics, and wasn't much for the movies, but I did watch the cartoon in the 1990s. My friend was a little too into that, saying how they claim to be ninjas, but live by the code of the samurai. 
---
Raphael would be your stealth assassin. Michaelangelo would be the tankiest, because cowabunga it is. Now, donatello would have high intelligence, he'd build, modify, and fix everyone's weapons, which means more points for strength and agility for the others. Leonardo is the leader, so he'd need higher charisma and perception, as well as intelligence.  
---
Side note: I know the animation would likely crash the server, but how cool would nunchucks be in this game. Maybe as a mod for bone clubs (bone club, plus 2 screws, plus 3 steel, equals nunchucks), it'd still be a 2 handed weapon, just a different grip. 
---
Ghostbusters is a little more difficult. Partly because of the way the game handles energy weapons, but also because everyone would want to be Venkman. He'd be doing something rapid fire, like commando or heavy guns. Ray would be a Jack of all trades. Egon would have nerd rage. That's not to say he'd be a bloodied build, he just would. All kidding aside, high intelligence, low charisma. Winston is a thinker. He comes in to give the Ghostbusters some relief, so I guess he'd be a medic, but he also carries some of Venkman's load, so that also makes him sort of a mule.
---
The character select is broken. That is the reason why I can’t create toons
---
They should just copy borderlands 2 trade system each item has a slot and both players confirm the trade
---
The only thing i really want is the cow grill and Im yet to get it. Theres supposedly going to be another round in September "outcome pending" of the next round of ATLAS donations so if we dont get what we want this time theres another chance coming

Probably, but I have no issues with people AFKing events especially this one if they are on the drums or spits but legit there is nothing worse than trying to get the event done and no one is even helping, including AFKers due to them just standing there, hopefully they end up getting kicked for inactivity lol
---
Would be a little more useful but not much, go to whitspring fountain for a free disease wipe

Or ceiling even
---
I want to add that only the  newer wasteland quests are voiced, the vanilla main quests are still identical except for some single npcs at certain locations without any relations to the quests at all.
---
At this point I'm just missing the tato salad and chally outfit
---
Oh yeah I almost forgot about that I’m gonna have to start collecting a lot of leather
---
Bethesda uses currency caps for the same reason any other game uses them, because it keeps their players coming back day after day.  The name of the game is almost always player retention, if they let you cash in all of your bullion at once then that gives you one less reason to be sure to log in tomorrow to redeem it.
---
You do the food one but I never seen anyone do the fusion core processor.
---
Every man for himself. The wasteland is hard out there.
---
For a lot of people, when they can't find what they need in exactly 2 sec, they usually find everything frustrating.

It's life in 2020, Internet Amazon , Netflix. you click and get what you want

I hope not being one one those people.
---
Calme the fuck down bro, wtf is your problem ? You wanna help me to understand or you just in a hate on a random Bloodied build user ? 
---
I understand all this shit and as i can see you clearly didn't read me properly or just didn't read me. I'm a PS4 player, for sure I have no idea wtf is really going on, so no i'm not gonna give feedback on their forum.
---
Now thank you and relaxe champ !
---
Nice I had like 3 of the outfits but I sold one for like 3000 caps idk seemed like a good price maybe I could have got more lol
---
Even if sick of the weapon, some new weapon variety would be great. The devs could never add enough weapons even if they are weapons I would never use, variety is the spice of life.
---
Because Bethesda was way too generous and lets people so easily complete the season early without having to spend a single cent on atoms for ranks, so the entitled people then get bored and start demanding even more free shit.
---
And the reason for that is.?
---
Ive been hoarding that and cloth for the protectron but I dont think it honestly matters because the last one proved Beth will intervene to ensure success
---
I think there’s some truth to it. She lands a lot more if everyone isn’t shooting at her in the air. Had a guy message me once to wait for her to land. I was the only one shooting her in the air then once I stopped she landed.  With the timer going if she doesn’t land enough it’s hard ta beat her. An someone went through the trouble of dropping the nuke so It’s kinda their queen. Definitely could be seen as wasting their time.
---
Yes  I am
---
This is what happens when it starts to burn and you don't get it checked out...
---
I'm all for it, I would like special ammo types to also become a thing in this game.
---
I usually find them around blood eagle camps.
---
1) i am not your bro
---
2) i am calm
---
3) i am not gonna waste my time explaining something that you have been TOO LAZY to properly research yourself. i provided 3 links, spend your own fucking time actually reading/watching them
---
4) you clearly don't understand shit, or you wouldn't have made this post
---
5) for the Nth time: stop posting your whines here and go to the actual official PTS forums to give feedback if you want to ACTUALLY see changes
---
I know but I mean it is not rocker scince or something like that or this is not first time seeing battle pass system
---
Yeah they definitely helped us out on the last one lol
---
It's broken
---
Jesus christ you...are...pissed lol. Move on champ lol
---
The way they work is the last unit laid down normally controls all the others.  Next time you see it, just run around and you can set the things to what ever ammo type you use.
---
Which is a real shame, I always saw the hunting rifle as a power house on NV and F3, on F76 it's rather underwhelming.
---
Great that its working to your specifications!
---
Yup forgot about it, thanks.
---
i am pissed? xD sure. and you're clueless
---
Okey guys , as an old fart on ps4 , not crying bitching or anything .
---
Just wanna ask how much this balance will affect a Junkie ? I know its too early to freak out and shit but say a JE Fixer is at 179 dmg with 9 commando + Bloody mess &amp; 5 addictions .

Aprox what will the number be after the balance ?
---
Thanks in advance

\*March 2021
---
Some people like to just create their own experiences too.
---
Personally, I could spend 2,000 hours building. I absolutely love the building in this game.
---
Finished 2 days ago and haven't logged on since. Fuck this new system.
---
She us immune to explosive damage.
---
S.U.I.T.E.D.
---
Some dude was paying like 5k for the masks a few hours ago 
---
That's the highest price I've seen so far 
---
So you did alright I think
---
I believe you'll keep your progress and whatever you've bought from the atom shop
---
But all your atoms will only be available on your gamepass version
---
I have no clue what will happen if you unlink your gamepass from your Bethesda account while your steam account is linked tho, I know that you didn't ask about that, I just suddenly got curious how they would handle that lol
---
Save me Typo-bot! My phone isn't easy to type on.
---
I doesn’t matter combat isn’t the issue. Where I shot back or not the launch was stole and after he shot us I decided to kill him for being a grade a ass hat
---
Bruh why is this dude gettin' downvoted? He's just asking a question.
---
That aside: It's 'cause they are probably low on caps. I hate it too when people buy my level 15 handmades that are SPECIFICALLY for low-levels :/
---
I just had about 10 people ready to do the event, and the event never started.
---
This isn't even really a battle pass system.  Battle passes are by design and definition a pass that you need to buy in order to unlock content through completing challenges.  Bethesda stripped almost all of the monetization out of the concept aside from giving the lazy/stupid or unfortunate an out to buy ranks when needed.
---
Its crazy to me that people are ignoring the Wend's, good XP and SCREWS as loot?! omg yes plz.
---
Dam I’ve never had that happen, apart from the prime meat bug that happens around 50% of the time
---
That’s crazy you where probably thrilled I’m definitely gonna be selling my extra maybe I’ll wait a few months
---
I heard its fixed on the pts
---
Wait so legendary tenderizers actually do exist if you have the plan for it
---
Holy fuck time to grind some cookouts
---
Don't clench too tight. Those nocturnal black powder rifles hurt.
---
Yeah i wish we could wear outfits over it
---
Daily stopped me frplaying why should I be punished for someone else's actions?  Bet your ass next dupe wawe I'm taking part. Bethesda doesn't care why should I?
---
By you actively coming and complaining that it’s easy not to read it. Why feel the need to comment? It’s nothing about your logic. It’s the way you went about it. We know it’s easy to skip posts but when the sub Reddit is filled with colossal problem/ legendary run give me atoms for finishing early pls/ bloodie junkies are getting nerf. So it may be easy to scroll by Thats not the issue it’s the sheer volume of the posts
---
Well... With the moments of Triumph currently going... You can now infinitely farm the legacy raids (not including LW and GoS)-  
---
But yeah, outside of that you are right.
---
I wouldn't know. Good question. Anyway, thanks for your answer! I'll make sure to use whatever atoms I've acquired so far before I plunge onto the Steam version!
---
I'd love that to
---
Uhh what do you mean? That's how most vault doors look from the outside 
---
Vault 76 is an exception
---
I think the secret service backpack looks great with the CSA. That said I really agree with you, I love it but stopped using it because I don't like looking like everyone else.
---
That was the first time I'd seen it not start at all. Someone had put the Red Rocket prefab and a Circus trailer very close to the event grounds- close enough to where you could see it from the spit. Not sure if that had anything to do with it, or the two nukes that were launched on the server, oh well.
---
Now that I think about it, painting the outside would be pretty sweet. You could almost make yourself disappear into the terrain
---
The seasonal or annual event rewards like Fashnaut masks will sell for 500-1000 to the right buyer especially if they're a new player(thank you game pass) so they can run around Appalachia in style sooner than later. Sun and skull are the biggest sellers. So are the santa crash plans and icicle light plans.
---
Depending on pts the second season will start flawless or within a week post current season, so I assume you can't progress in any way (at least intended, who knows which bugs may occure).
---
I just ignore diseases. Am I gimping myself?
---
Never bother curing them.
---
So you do play NW, sometimes.
---
Yes, it was posted on the marked a few weeks ago. Maybe even exactly the same picture
---
It’s.... Its in the title. I could understand most items, but where the fuck would a stash box be besides the stash box section???
---
Ooh yea I forgot it got delayed on console... should be soon!
---
No problem dude 
---
Oh I did wanna mention, the reason I was thinking about that whole unlinking account thing is because a while back I read someone was having a problem with that
---
They moved over to steam, but all the atoms they were earning and buying would never show up
---
Turns out it was all going to their original account, I'm not sure if it was gamepass or epic store or what tho 
---
I've never heard of anyone having that issue again after that, but if that happens, that's probably what's going on and you'll have to contact support 
---
Unlinking your gamepass may prevent that, buuut I know that unlinking your account usually whipes all your characters and progress 
---
So it's kinda uncharted territory from what I could find out :I 
---
Good luck! Stay cautious for stuff like that that seems a little off!
---
I buy them as cheap scrip.
---
&gt; Sometimes it’s time restrictions (WoW, Destiny) and sometimes it’s ridiculous RNG odds (Borderlands, Diablo)
---
76 went with all of the above
---
Everyones dps is going down but bloodied and junkies still do the most
---
There is literslly no difference.
---
Just because there were some exploits without any tool where this restriction hits, doesn't mean the dupe scripts work like that. It is currently possible for some people to dupeand create new items without stacking them.
---
Had a guy on our public team crouched in stealth up a really high tree at the event. He didn't move from that spot for hours, no idea how he didn't get logged out from inactivity.
---
You expect candyland?
---
He was also buying tenderizers for 15k! O_O 
---
He may have just been a dude with a ton of alts all maxed on caps I have no idea 
---
I only had one tenderizer at the time and was afraid Id never get another one so I didn't, but now I have 3 of them lmao rip me
---
They will prob tweak base damage of weapons and/or enemy resistances. 
---
Also because the calculations are easier we won't see enemy hp bounce around.
---
But that would kill my business model! Hahaha i’m an antibiotics/disease cure vendor. Those things sell like hotcakes
---
Gotcha mechanic. If they left it uncapped I'd have 100000000 scrip and not play until new weapons were obtainable.
---
Ah damn! Good point, it would.  I should have bought it while it was in the store. I thought about it but didn't get it as I didn't have a backpack at that point in time.
---
Its honestly not that bad. I bought all my ss armor, ubderarmor, mods, gauss shotgun, gauss shotgun mods and it didn't feel like it took that long. 
---
Indo wish theyd up the scrip and caps by a little but tho
---
The email have to be the same. 
---
Also, either atoms or fallout 1st subscription will transfered.
---
The Enclave that created the scorched were taken out, and MODUS was isolated and cut off from the rest of the main Enclave. He then set about recruiting new members. I say perfect time to right the wrongs of the old Enclave and rebuild with a new vision.
---
Just failed the last 3 back to back. 10 people there, not a single enemy anywhere to be found.
---
The one in the toxic valley can fail because the toads do a 180 and just run away. 
---
The one in the forest used to be the most reliable but even that was among the once that failed today.
---
All the others can fail because of mole rats or scorpions staying underground forever.
---
How hard can it be to make all the prime beasts and their mini adds auto aggro on the summoning drum so they actually move towards the players?
---
This event started last week and I've done god knows how many prime meat events. I'd say that about 10% of those have failed. 
---
None of them failed when I solo'ed them so there is something wrong with the enemy AI.
---
u/ladydevann u/valseek What's being done about this? People are literally not getting Prime Meats and, in turn, scrip because this is just not working for a lot of players.
---
Good to know. The same Bethesda account is already linked between my Xbox and Steam account so I guess I forsee no real issues on the transfer.
---
I wouldn't for more than just the Wastelanders grind, the quests in this game are rather meh and aren't worth replaying like in F3 and FNV. The bullion grind certainly doesn't help though, they should make blueprints as well as nuclear winter rank account wide.
---
Like some people said, they found a duper selling items.
---
Yes this is what i also thought of. I'm 100% for update 22 damage rework, but jesus...how the Gatling Laser could be that much hurt !? -80% dmg...wtf !? We had some serious multipliers there !
---
Yeah, let's not flatter ourselves. That's not happening to the vast majority of us in the wild.
---
A perfectly preserved pie and 2 party hats. Then open a lunch box and go on a killing spree and watch all the confetti fly
---
Yea pretty disappointing, I like the backpack but I just can't use that eyesore atm.
---
If you bothered to do any research on the subject you would have found about 100 post saying that it is already fixed on PTS and coming Soon™
---
Idfk this is literally the only fallout subreddit with this rule too:/
---
Unfortunately not.
---
Yea making stealth harder sometimes wouldn't be a problem, but it's on all ops for some reason. I'd be fine with swapping a perk or two now and then, and let my teammates shine a little brighter. But this forces me out of my fine tuned build every time. Which is just great trying to return to without a built in perk load out manager, so in the PTS I'm just a mess right now because of me trying to work with being unable to use any of my weapons and perks in one of the ops
---
Been 2 weeks though. Which is very annoying. Xbox has been turned off multiple times. Game has been restarted too. No change  and wonder if I have to uninstall and then reinstall game or something. Thanks though
---
I Totally agree with you i usually sell things way under there normal price unless its ammo then i sell them all for 1 cap each(exceptions are missiles, Mini nukes and Fusion cores but even those i sell for way less that what most people sell them for like the T-60 Jetpack i see people selling them for 1k caps and im over here selling it for 100 caps also with serums that i sell i see people selling them for 700-1500 caps and i sold 3 marsupial serums for 400 caps each 1200 caps total i sell purified water for 1 cap each i know that its easy to get but i still sell it for 1 cause some people buy it and when i have excess gun powder i sell it for 2 caps each not like 10 or 15 like ive seen other people in the end i usually just try and find it or on the occasion i will find other people like me selling things for way less than they could sell them for just cause they know that people especially the lower levels (i am in this Category only being level 16 as i just started 3 weeks  ago)  dont have as many caps and i the end everyone comes and buys from me and i know they dont leave angry even if they just come to sell for higher i dont care cause in the end of it all they probably wont sell it again and i have more caps so what i say is Sell it for cheaper and you will be better off
---
I'm hoping it will let me drop/destroy some at least when I log back in
---
Yeah. But I can dream!
---
Yeah i saw the drop in dmg from the innov youtube video this past week, it did seem weird compared to other gatling type weapons.
---
Put first on the wall a framed painting  and then put the board game painting on it.
---
Well, as for him he lives in SoCal and i dropped off his lists a couple months ago but he doesn’t play much. As for my GF we live in NorCal  and she dropped off my list 2 weeks ago
---
For skins, something like this:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/643
---
That just happened to me and all drums and spits were full so it would have finished fast😭😭
---
One for me didn’t start and that was 8am UK time. First time it’s happened though.
---
This. Screw the resilient one. Feels so convoluted to have to give them a tap once they're riddled with holes like swiss cheese just to kill them.
---
This happened to me too. I showed up early and watched as other people started popping in. At around 2 minutes after they all started going crazy killing critters and such, but the event never started for me. After a couple minutes they all stopped and stood still looking at what they unlocked, then fast traveled. I got nothing
---
Weird should happen every time only takes 30 seconds
---
Yeah, this is mostly why i made this post lol. I saw a video of Angry Turtle and Innov and that was it, i freaked out...😨
---
Good question, I'd like to know as well.
---
That's dedication!
---
Remember, only accounts from pc works on pc. No crossways between xbox, ps4 or pc at all.
---
I've started hopping around every single vendor on every server I join looking for the tenderiser plan. Seems to be as hard to find as the holy grail.
---
Foundation has a machine use google
---
I've mentioned it a few times as something that turns me off, along with cheaters (last match I was lucky enough to spawn next to handmade and scout armor and things looked bright, and then some guy insta murdered me from behind with what seemed like a rapid-fire crossbow), if it was a bit faster (and auto-disabled CustomINI, because right now I have to close the game, move the file, and then reload adding another minute to the wait times) I may play more.
---
Glad someone finally said it. VATS, Sucks, and is broken as it is, but seriously?????
---
For any weapon. But especially single shot.
---
Yeah Vats sucks. Have a target right in front of me and I hit vats and it targets something to my right that is way farther away and I can’t hit my target.  Or it will target my grenade that I have thrown instead of an enemy.
---
Did not destroy them.
---
You know what would be a good idea? Giving a mailbox function to those Personal Computers they gave everyone back in Wild Appalachia under the idea that they'd be used to track quests and handle all your non-gameplay stuff. That, because they haven't touched them since, are now only good for knowing whether Biv or the Scoutbots aren't bugged out before you fast travel to them. Add some kinda "E.M.A.I.L." function so you can log in and collect attachments (dropped legendaries) or even send them to friends. Add a cap tax or something like the vendors to "cover shipping costs."
---
Or just give everyone a free Courier's Express Mailbox that does that.
---
they hate rifle users? its joke right? its still the most easiest play in the game. you jump and spin-kill every npc at max range diameter. And now after years there will be (maybe) one event for other builds and "they hate rifle uses"????
---
Why exactly? They don't weight anything and it doesn't  matter if you have 20 or 800 in the inventory.
---
I would like for this "home" (I would envision a trading store + BBQ shack on the side) to be like the BoS Atlas event. Except, this is one I would actually want to contribute to.
---
Also, would be nice if one of the goals for this event is having a travelling vendor bot doing Grahm's old trade route (complete with sentry moo moo) that is programmed by Grahm to spit his unique brand of wisdom and witticisms but with a protectron voice.
---
I said it's easier to dupe stacked items, not impossible to dupe unstacked ones.
---
Whats wring with it? Might buy it and refund it due the bug, mostly they don't cancell the order.
---
And I said there is literally no difference.
---
Considering how every time I'm lucky enough to get to the event it's over within a minute, sometimes really hard to imagine it can be failed or that you would need 9 people to help.
---
The "drink and spam collect" trick. Only when I can't be arsed to walk the 20 feet or so to my section of the river and collect, though. lol
---
When you play enough, you can outfit a new character with a whole set of awesome gear right when they reach level 50
---
Doesn't even need to be removed, just expanded, I have 700 notes right now and I havent been focusing on events at all, only doing the ones unknown will give alright rewards like Scorched Earth or Collosal problem and Meat Cook right now.
---
Same problem with scrip, I have around 400 pounds of just scrip weapon in my stash in need to get rid of, and I cant always remember to turn it in every day, especially when it's not a static turn over time. There's a lot of problems with the current system.
---
Yeah that's right, I got loads left but no need to trade them away. My reward for playing the game early. My temp ban didn't even stop me finishing Legendary Run. Power creep is the only way to nerf them but there will be other ways to dupe; Bethesda's terrible bug control guarantees it.
---
The way of the world.
---
Snap.  Just another time/spend gate.  I have to log in daily to spend 20 rather than just 140 for the week.
---
I doubt its from dupers. I had absolute dog crap before I rolled a IE15r lever from the purveyor and then found the market sub. I traded up and bought other stuff to trade. I now have almost every rare outfit and plan in game along with a bE15r and B2525 handmade, a Bsss DCG on my main and when my alt hit 50, I gave him a JSS MMG, JE .50cal and full set of Van/+1a/cav forest scout to get him going and the list goes on. Its just trading up when you can on the market sub. Don't rely on in game vendors
---
How about it should be basic to find your loot? Toggle inside the options, moddera already did it after a few days. Just modifie the textur, give it a new if and add tie it to the setting. Work of 5mins for someone with 1week knowledge.
---
You get dirty water from the clean sink, and still get diseases, I use the thirst quencher perk when doing the drink/spam COLLECT trick. It us supposed to protect you from 80% of the diseases, but I don't think it works. Still catching waterborne diseases 7 of 10 times about the same amount before the perk.
---
It should not be a perk at all, let alone a legendary one. 
---
Just have the legendary glowing effect persist on their corpse until you loot the item.
---
Then what's the problem? Good luck getting through doors at the top of stairs though.
---
Easy calculations. Currently all bonus will get multiplied, in the future they will get added.
---
There is a trick you have to do drink then as the water is running you spam collect you get 10 to 15 dirty waters this way vs 1 per animation. This means I usually have to drink 3 dirty waters to make 4 hours of razorgrain soup.
---
I got really, really lucky. A very nice player and some of their friends were giving out free legendaries near top of the world; I managed to snag a BSSS Deathclaw gauntlet &amp; boxing glove and an instigating explosive fixer for free. Never found anything remotely that good from drops or event rewards
---
Got multiple characters just to store things on
---
Not mine you don't. Sounds like a challenge ;)
---
Oh probability, you are a heartless bitch
---
Remember the glitch where they just disappeared so u had to get it ASAP?
---
Due to the flattened damage, all non-automatic rifles are relatively nerfed. After One Apparachia, the fire rate is most important for high DPS.
---
' so I steamrolled everything  '
---
I go to events using a less powerful weapon so everyone there can get in on the XP and fun.
---
When you do the above i will just take a smoke break waiting for you to complete the event for us. Get downed.....steamroll your revive.
---
I just finished yesterday casually playing an hour a day or so. I missed a couple days and had the challenges auto complete once. The odds are not in your favor unless you buy the ranks. Some of the rewards will be purchasable via gold bullion on the next patch though if the PTS is anything to go by
---
So what?
---
If these 9 people weren't there at all the event would fail aswell... it doesn't make a difference at all since no one is there to do the event. Better rant about this shitty event design which is annoying after the first few times do no one wants to participate anymore.
---
I've seen it trade for legacies multiple times. I myself just learned mine
---
I toss cryo grenades in the air at SBQ and target with VATS when near the queen.  It works... sometimes lol
---
I was doing it solo until he came and just stood there looking around
---
I have a Fasnacht Beret for you. Only 29999 caps.
---
I swear the mannequins in Skyrim move.
---
4k
---
Ive never gotten any diseases from collecting dirty water from the sink.
---
Damn, we have all seen the Faschant beret for 10k+
---
Atoms..
---
I had an Nazi Glowing Bloated One. 
---
https://ibb.co/9ZgWw7J
---
It literally makes it feel like a mobile game.
---
Imo were getting to a point where some crafting will be pointless as people are lazy and just want everything to drop from everything.
---
Thanks, definitely decided to put the next nine points I get into the Commando cards, and I'll keep an eye out for Junkies 👍🏻
---
I'm sure this is a bug. I'm a gatling laser user as well, on PS4. Asked Angry Turtle in comments. He said all energy weapons are bugged on PTS right now. Obły ballistic weapons work OK (with the intended change to calculate damage). Energy weapons are broken - that's why there's this massive damage drop. I really hope this bug gets fixed before it goes to live servers with patch 23.
---
That explains why escape artist does jack shit there 🤔
---
WAH ME LAZER NO WORK USED TO MELT NOW TAKES EFFORT WAH
---
Fallout New Vegas, Battle Rifle and the unique "This Machine". If FO76 were to ever include it I could see Different Scopes, Muzzles, Suppressors, and Receivers being thrown on it.
---
When I'm not playing I leave my playstation afk since the event started and still don't have the meat tenderizer plan, not once lol, I have everything else though and given away about 15 grill master hats
---
There a perk that makes a noise when you are close to one. When i need to get one i pop it on and go along my business until it beeps so i dont actively have to look known spots.
---
I’ve accepted that it’s kinda like an ability they have. Sort of like a flare to catch your heat seeking missiles so to speak.
---
Still sucks ass tho.
---
That. A huge reason I play the game do much is trading. I got 90% of my great gear threw trading. The whole reason I got a reddit was to be part of the market sub
---
Jokes been played too many times that it just isn't funny anymore
---
It was double SCORE this weekend as far as i know. Not double XP.
---
Wait there was a double xp weekend
---
It makes easier for them to "develop" future content, aparrently. They dont give a shit about whats "actually" balanced so long as people keep playing the game. Thank God I saved a good number of levels to switch from heavy energy gunner to heavy ballistics. And now the explosive 50 cal grind begins.. *throws Vampire 50% limb dam 90% reduced weight GatLaser in the trash.
---
we will see after you fight lvl100 npcs with one appalacia update and legendary perks for full armor set.
---
Is there a list of rewards somewhere that I can use to check which ones I still need?
---
It's on and off, one minute I can see my friends and next minute I can't, it's very disruptive especially if you are planning a trade, this needs to an addressed, it won't happen once but sometimes it will fix itself after a minute or in an hour
---
Worse when you have bought all you want, have 5000 bullion and 800+ notes lol.
---
It make sens. There's no reason for energy weapons to have that much gap between them after a damage formula rework. Otherwise it would mean that Bethesda is legitimately nerfing and buffing weapons.
---
Do you have a backpack on? Probably with the chemist or grocers mod in?
---
This is a rare one where you can buy it from a vendor and it counts. Pop by camps and you should find one in short order.
---
FO4 has a Creative Club Tesla Weapon, all that would need to be added are modifiable parts while the Models simply be ported over.
---
You realise that all weapons are affected by this new formula lol.
---
Have fun bro...
---
I have all character slots currently filled and played them all pre-Wastelanders; all the characters being mid to max geared. The only real grind back then was getting the backpacks but it was doable and not a annoying grind. Now with Wastelanders I can't bear myself to grind the entire questline out after running it through on two characters with both raider and settler factionlines completed. Not only that but the bullion grind is insane just on my main character; I would need to put in a huge amount of work to gear them up and this is coming from someone who plays daily with 2k+ hours. Now with the upcoming Legendary perk system and the BOS questline ontop of that I don't see myself able to even touch a single of my alts and get them to bullion stage. This game is sadly no longer multiple character friendly; you literally have to play a single character and build if you ever hope to reach endgame status.
---
i had one of these aswell once lol [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498877695330091038/734127963007746078/Photo_2020-07-18-212104.png)
---
I guarantee some of the stuff you have is from dupers
---
Your on the wrong way, sorry.
---
The fact is, they don't want us to play. Lifetime grind like bullions or the upcoming legendary perk system, the devastating rng of all items (about 25000  modules to get a full secret service armor with right stats) are not intended to be completed. They dont even want us to try it, we should stop playing since only new players bring cash. Sure, you as individual can say "meeh I'm 1st" but beth isn't caring at all. 
---
Fallout 76 was never planned, and as they decided to make it real, the only main purpose was cash and testing. Testing which fuckups generates a shitstorm and which flaws we eat without any reactions to know what they can do with their upcoming prestige projects. Fallout is just a bought franchise, it is not important like elder scrolls or doom. Fallout is only a cash cow since its in the hands of bethesda.
---
Broken atx items are intended, same as fast travel bugs or broken vats (they fixed vats once accidently on private test servers a few months ago, on live servers it was still broken). That's why they never fix these issues, but stuff we profit from like the camp building glitch or instant reload from score firework grenades are solved ASAP.
---
I want a perception perk to highlight the dead body when turn on the light of PA or PIP-boy.
---
Sure they're looking for the pen and not the grill?
---
I used to have a landing platform camp at the back of dropsite. There was a serif stares at the gap in the back fence and the entire build space was a giant platform with a fully loaded  base underneath for everyone's convenience. That was untill they did an update and brought in the bug that stops her landing if you are not standing on the ground. Then the next update brought in the stagger bug that stops her landing. Don't put camps or tents near where you are fighting her and she lands all the time.
---
I don't have the chart, but in a video I was watching he said its about a 40% nerf across the board
---
This is literally all op needs to do.  In capitalism, ‘free’ tends to come with or result in some fairly serious bullshit
---
It will end going into everyone's inventory on the server like can's of food used too... It's a good idea till you get heavy weapon in the middle of a fight that overencumbers you and causes your death from lack of AP.  That is probably the lesser evil than the FOMO that drive you mad.
---
Just 3 more ranks and done with this shit. Can't wait.
---
Don't think so, that was a limited time offer
---
What platform are you on? I think I have an extra grill
---
Was my mistake, there never was a helmet,, stupid because they show one in the picture
---
* trading makes a huge difference. Or at least having a friend that loves trading.
---
   * keep your unwanted good stuff for trading
---
* having 5 chars = up to 5 times more storage = up to 5 times more legendaries you can farm before scrip limit and stash limits are reached.
---
* saving up for purveyor events, on all chars. (next is 10-14 september)
---
* always complementing the Purveyor on her outfit or hair before buying stuff from her.
---
* There is a correlation between the server and the drops from the purveyor. If you or a friend is getting bad drops from the purveyor, server jump before buying more.
---
I have both leather coats. Also, I rarely don anything else...
---
There is a bug where you can not enter instances like the Overseer's Home or the Wayward when you are on a team and the team leader is currently logged out/disconnected. The normal Enter option, which accesses the team leader's instance, doesn't work and the Enter Solo option doesn't turn up. I filed a ticket about that a few days ago.
---
The only workaround I know is to leave the team (or wait for the team leader to get back into the game).
---
Grocers mod is on my backpack. Already crafted a regular one, put that on, logged out and switched back to it. Sadly to no effect.
---
Yes. I can never seem to find one when that challenge is active but when it's not i come across heaps.
---
Works!
---
if this NOT happen i would ask for a refund
---
Well, my very first item she gave me was a ve90 .50 which is still used today.
---
There was no double xp weekend, only double score.
---
Sorry not quite following. Once you get in pa your backpack mod will no longer effect your food weight. So once in pa put on threw hiker rank3 and see if your weight is where it should be
---
everybody gangsta till the wooden preston start to walk and ask you to help some settlements
---
I will add some tip:
---
Bow cannot use when using power armor, crossbow can.
---
I never use vats for bow since it accuracy good enough and because arrow itself as a separate projectile, vats was not working properly with bow.
---
Don’t buy bow plan except you find it below 50 caps, because you will get basic bow plan by doing quest.
---
I suggest you have both weapons since you’re not power armor user. They used different ammo type. (Arrow/Bolt)
---
You also lose the carry weight from deep pockets and your backpack. 60 pounds for backpack, 40 for deep pockets on your limbs. Meaning the 100 bounse from excavator would equal that. Keeping your carry weight the same both in and out of pa
---
You ran out of steel? It takes like 2 steel to repair it.....
---
the pile of goo that dissapear after 2 seconds T_T
---
If you were on PC I'd say I need you to come over with ~50 Tato Salads so I can get the rest of those "player Revives" for those sweet sweet atoms.
---
Wait a minute, beret was that expensive?
---
They should leave this in.
---
But since it's fun, they wont.
---
Ive had this issue as well. I always suspected its their LOD's, whoever did them had no clue what they were doing. It looks awful and to date I have not been able to find any guide to fix this.Its like anything that isnt in the center of the screen gets fuzzy. I dont know how else to describe it.
---
No, that ended quite some time ago. Sorry.
---
Can you link to the full list, you apparently already know whats available to get. Id love to see that.
---
You can buy all the plans for like 50caps lol
---
I was referring more to how we can't switch out perks like other weapon users because our builds rely on Perception and Agility if stealth build, thus making us useless with other weapon types.
---
I'd probably be Rose because I have many pointless stories I could blab on about. Except they'd be about San Diego.
---
Who would want to be Dorothy though? Being the straight "man" in a comedy isn't exactly a preferred role for folks.
---
Keen.
---
You can try your luck at purveyors, i got aae 90% railway gun yesterday. 
---
Visit another player shop, sometimes you get good weapon with fair price.
---
Or you can playing straight to wastelander chain quest, gather resources and trade with plan. These weapons op as hell.
---
Whoa man...times are hard as of late..
---
Oh, okay
---
The said on the PTS the game board is fixed to work on walls again but no mention of Weapon displays. Knowing Bethesda their fix is only half assed and Weapon wall mounts are still broken.
---
What do you mean by this?  That they most likely will change this and only people who have it will be the ones with it once it's changed?
---
I’m at t65 skin now. Can i run completely if properly done all score challenge in time?
---
Look close to the darth vader's helmet..
---
I put together a T60 PA set for my buddy
---
yes, this is definitely a side effect of all the time gates.   
---
I have 5 chars I play with and have felt this to. The way I cope with it, is letting go of the feeling that I HAVE TO reach the limits. I still do the grinds but when I do not have enough time or simply don't feel like it, that is okay.
---
Literally this. People waste too much time worrying about others in life. You got your caps, be happy.
---
I've posted this character a number of times before, but behold, Fi, who makes tea, and sells things like a market flea. ([Le character build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=67666fa&amp;d=ss2se2p10pa0p40p30ln0p90p80ej4e00cr0ce0cd1cj1i30ii0i50a72aj2am2ar2a21ao0lq0ll0l71lt2lu2ia0&amp;n=Fi))
---
She has a cultists dagger and instigating deathclaw gauntlet, which suffice for 99.9% of situations. Just to mix it up, she also carries a 1-star anti armour grenade launcher. 
---
Additional skills, mixed in when I need them. White Knight in Agility. Makeshift Warrior, Gunsmith, Fix it Good, Weapon Artisan, Contractor. 
---
She has a 3-vendor store. 1 vendor is all ammo, of which she has billions as she rarely uses any of it. 1 vendor is clothing and weapons. 1 vendor is aid, everything from chems and serums to boobleheads and magazines.
---
Shes level 130'ish, she needs nothing to maintain her. I never use + damage skills, though I do always have incisor and martial artist on. That should even mean I'm not really effected by the upcoming nerf? And I couldn't be happier playing her. She frequently makes sales equating to 5-10k caps a day, from an hour of play.
---
Mines u/FUCKER-DI-APE
---
If so that would make me very happy.  Thank you.
---
My xbox controller doesn't have a control key to hold!
---
Grazie, anche a me piace il tuo.
---
Im tired of getting hunters and nocturnal, my furious plasma caster is decent enough but I'd love to get my hands on some other useful effects.
---
Freaking Dean
---
I'd trade you all the vanguards I've been getting, its either been vangaurds or zealots all damn week.
---
Yeah but who knows what is and whats not duped? The market is the market regardless, unless you dont want to use good stuff because you're scared its duped, which means nothing
---
Not the first time. Tse shotguns, and third person gatling users have both had major setbacks. It wasn't the end of the world, but did have to change weapons. I think the melee guys had some changes too.
---
As someone who has been "nerfed" multiple times, it is not so bad, and it is actually much more fun using more than 1 weapon all the time.
---
It does not allow you to modify it. 
---
Even when you know all the plans for it, and it says it can be  modified. 
---
You cannot actually do anything to change it from the basic format.
---
No, at least I wasn't able to.
---
Bethesda doesnt like perma banning people that might pay a FO1st subscription so cheaters get a 3 day ban max if YOU can prove they cheated. Also im pretty sure Bethesda support is out sourced which is why its so horrible.
---
If the legendary run ends in 15 days, when Zorbo reaches the end, you will be cutting it close. My guess is no, but it's possible with extra grinding or another double score weekend.
---
The cap on gold bullion conversion is the stupidest thing in the game so far. 
---
20 per day but you can easily earn hundreds a day, and cant use them. 
---
What purpose does it serve? It doesnt make me want to log in and play more. It makes me want to play less. 
---
They arent worried about any in game economy, they just want to force us to play every single day and its ridiculous.
---
Greg's mine supply, next to the terminal upstairs
---
yeah i myself can only really descripe my situation as having a circle around me with perfectly fine textures but anything outside that circle around me gets blurry and pixelated
---
Depends, how many atoms you got???
---
i havent bought all i want. AND i bought the turbo fertilizer twice by accident..... so i can either sadly look at 750 wasted gold in my pipboy or i can destroy by dropping it....... yay. i know its my fault but i wish i could refund it or drop it for someone at least 😑
---
*BOOM* **ROASTED**
---
You can
---
If you think about it, the straight man always has to be the tank. It's their job to take all the shots while returning fire. While IRL Bea Arthur hated Betty White, for reasons that remain a mystery to this very day, Rose was always there to pick her up when she was downed.
---
what level? ps4? maybe i can help out.  i have some decent plans and weapons
---
No joke this needs to be fixed as people have spent good money on Atom shop items that have not been bug tested correctly.
---
Ah yes, thank you. I want to gather extra atom for the contemporary set comeback.
---
Bayoneted.....
---
We're both around 130
---
Thank god im not the only one, I thought it might just be me
---
Ha we've both still most of the Fasnacht gear but thanks for amour idea
---
130 and we're both on Xbox but thanks a lot!
---
Liking this one the most. Cheers!
---
Oh yeah, the default .ini files are a mess. 
---
The circle could be caused by the games tesselation setting. The game also has DoF which for some reason only editing the fallout76.ini in the game directory was able to disable.
---
fTessFactorMaxDistanceScale=100.0000
---
fTessFactorMinDistanceScale=100.0000
---
Those are the default values, as far as I can tell, none of the presets even touch these so you'll have the same issue on any settings. You can turn it up, or turn it off. I'm running a 1050m, so I opted for off. Same thing with DoF. There's also a similar problem for shadows where the line between the high detail and lower detail shadows is way too sharp and really noticeable. 
---
fBlendSplitDirShadow=48
---
I haven't spent a lot of time testing exactly how this value scales, but bumping it up has no negative performance impact and smooths out the transition. I've got mine at about 200 because that was high enough to make my problems go away.
---
What a about terminals?
---
Hahahahhaha HAHAHAHAHA 
---
Seriously, i doubt it but i have hope, HOPEEEE
---
Actually, Dutchess has some Blanche- like qualities, not the least of which is her southern, but not west virginian accent (charm) . I think Gail might be the most Dorothy- like. Weasel had some Rose-ish qualities, but there is no substitute for Sofia.
---
I’m not. I asked a question to better understand your post. It’s hard to answer a question without actually knowing the problem. 
---
Yes there are human NPCs. If that was your only complaint is that you want to see an ai human vs an ai robot, sure, there you go.
---
I dont think there isnmuch rhyme or reason to what triggers the auto completion bug. I've stayed logged on multiple times in adventure and never experienced the auto completion bug. I've had the reset happen while I was in the middle of NW trying to last minute complete a challenge and never had the auto complete bug.
---
We just don't have the broad data to really determine what triggers it and everything is really just speculation.
---
On earlier levels you'll need to use stealth as much as possible if you're having trouble.  
---
The shooting through walls isn't specific to Assaultrons as it happens with other enemies with conventional firearms too, though we also benefit from this as you're able to hit a target behind cover using vats.
---
They're just supposed to be difficult enemies, not bugged.  Your fear will eventually turn to a feeling of inconvenience lol.  
---
If you aren't using a particular build, try to have a somewhat cohesive loadout for your perks at least.  You don't have to jump head first in to a Bloodied build etc., just make sure perks complement eachother, ideally strengthening eachother, e.g. 'Covert Operative' is great with 'Sneak'. 
---
 There are also perks like 'Bloody Mess' that work great with any build as it adds 15% to damage, no matter what the weapon.
---
You agree to PvP when you take it though...
---
If you are asking if Bethesda.net owners can give a copy to their friend on steam, that never was a thing. 
---
If you are asking if you can convert for free to steam, that ended months ago.
---
Saw someone sell the letters plan for 10k when it cost like 9k?
---
Sure does, thanks for the confirmation, it got me to pick it up. Crazy that I now have an excavator with a jet pack lol
---
I did the barbecue event maybe 20 times this last 3 days. Haven't seen it break yet.
---
I did have one Prime Cuts event break when the end monster never arrived. Could have been due to someone covering the Flatwood spawn with his base, though? 
---
Also, I never see dead servers. But in on PC, not sure if consoles are different.
---
She got that chonky-chonk
---
I switched servers when it seemed like that was happening to me and was able to join one
---
Yes! Ive been looking for a replacement gun for awhile because it's so aggravating.
---
My favorite is a yao guai head that's hit 88mph and has absolutely no brakes.
---
I couldnt I tried that
---
Oh wow, I assumed that pretty much everybody had all this already so I've just been dropping a lot of the crap, lol.
---
Are people really paying that much for the outfits and recipe/plan? =s
---
Without perks and high charisma that plan is over 10K for a lot of players.
---
Sacrifice a rat, newt, and goat to the RNG gods.
---
Yeah, it's a great way to earn those daily Caps! I'll usually craft as many Diluted items as I can, craft Chems and also cook all my Food items. Then sell to the Vendor Bots, selling everything I don't need, including Grenades etc. Then, can always top it off with a Serum. Easy Peasy!
---
But why sell it for the exact same price. I would sell it for half tbh
---
Sadly I have had the event break at least 5 times. This is on Xbox mind you. It is about 2 minutes before it starts and everyone loads in and the even just never starts. This usually happens when someone has their FO 1st tent close by and or when Grham is off in the woods pretty far from the event itself.
---
 I don’t agree, furious is especially useless of 2h because of the slow swing speed
---
Unfortunately it does not save until you exit the vault gotta try again.
---
I participated in the event that lasted couple of seconds - I wasn't able to get from drums to submit prime meat and the event was already over. But as a consolation prize I get Meat Tenderizer Plan, so couldn't complain ;)
---
This is what I thought. There was so much hype for the cookout in the lead up to this, and I find it really disappointing to show up and barely even have time to get your bearings, let alone do any of the tasks, and then it is over. There’s been a few times that I fast traveled to the event as soon as the alert popped up, and it was done before I arrived.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA
---
I kinda get bored of the tasks. Id prefer it go quickly.
---
They tried this. People complained. They went back to full size.
---
It could be because it's early morning where I am but it's quite remarkable to witness and has happened each time today. The first time I wondered if it had put me onto a private world by accident as it was absolutely deserted and then everyone popped into existence on top of my character!
---
I submitted a ticked and get Atoms back. I'll probably buy it again when they'll fix it. If I'll have to, since it's still is marked as Owned in the Atom Shop...
---
Totally - especially given how contagious these diseases are. My gear protects me from radiation to the point I can run around in a nuke zone, but one slap from a Ghoul and that's it I've got a flappy limb.
---
If you started now you would not come anywhere close to finishing, but you would still get some cool stuff.
---
Since everybody wants a moo moo just like Grahm
---
If you're talking about primal cuts it was that way last year.
---
Also the new dwily ops will do the same thing, no stealth by design. Its dumb.
---
If you're talking about stealth elsewhere in the game yeah it seems pretty broken... for months stealth has treated me well but now there are time I stay hidden I shouldn't but mostly times I should be hidden exact scenarios I've done 100 times and I get found. Something seems off and I can't place it.
---
Hmmm, are you certain? I thought it was in actual patch notes at some point. I wasn't able to locate it in the few minutes of googling though, so perhaps it is a bug. Either way I'm OK with it since it removes impetus for players to grief for Flux.
---
Because they don’t want to waste the caps they used to buy it?
---
The energy weapon values on test server are definitely strange. My plasma caster on live has equal ballistic and energy damage (433/433) but on test the energy is much lower than the ballistic (278/91).
---
Finally! The solution we all needed!
---
Bored, depressed or unhappy at 2am on a Monday? Just simply stop living!
---
For bosses: B2525. For general purpose: BE25. I always prefer the BE25 but that's just because  I like explosions &gt;!&lt;
---
Why buy it twice then?
---
That is because you are collecting water from the sink. It takes about 3 to 5 seconds to collect each dirty water. There is a trick if you point your target at the drain on the sink hit drink(E on pc) and as the animation plays the pool of water at the bottom of the sink can be collected from by spamming collect(R on pc) so in the 3 to 5 seconds you get about 10 to 13 dirty waters. To get those same 10 dirty waters by collecting(R on pc) will take 30 to 50 seconds. 
---
I usually make 20 to 30 razorgrain soups which require 1 boiled water each(40 dirty waters at 5 seconds each= 3.33 minutes of time) 
---
Using the trick I get 10 dirty waters with one sink animation of 5 seconds or to get the 40 dirty waters a total time of 20 seconds instead.
---
Try it with your sink once you know the DRINK/spam COLLECT trick you too will risk the diseases just to save precious minutes.
---
They were probably close to max caps and wanted somewhere to “store them” and now are low on caps so putting the plan up for sale.
---
what is a french ghoul?
---
No double score
---
Well played!
---
I can't say what is the real problem in your case, since I don't know your cards and armor, but due to lags on some servers you're constantly in danger, regardless the sneaking abilities. My second character is also bloodied sneak commando, have unyielding set with 2 better sneak pieces, 41+ AGI and whole set is shadowed and still I sometimes found servers when sneak doesn't work - I may stand in the middle of nowhere or inside empty building and sneak just stopped working. Only solution in that situation is to change server.
---
Yeah it's meant to be even weighting but I don't know... I traded for mine and don't regret it. Just wish the damn thing wasn't so heavy or I'd have a range of them in my vendors to see if they sell. Not had a legendary drop yet which is now my new endgame.
---
The E because the DPS is about the same and it won't chew through ammo as fast.
---
I think I have it?
---
You can't say what's better - it depends of your build and purpose (enemies) you're trying to kill.
---
Lyon's Pride was a good group too, if somewhat disdainful of the common Wastelander.
---
I'm loving it. Every 15mins a Primal and hourly the cook off. Raking it in!
---
Ah ok, surprisingly this doenst happen at scorched earth which is good as my B2525 fixer can do work to the queen
---
I was there last year and grabbing cowshit and stomping out grass fires is not my idea of fun. I understand you are expressing your opinion but I'm going to stay on the drums, and if they change the mechanic I will probably lose interest again, much like I did last year.
---
Ah. Wish I could do that.
---
I know, right? The four from Severin Manor on Solstheim always made me worry I would wake up and they'd be clustered around the bed.
---
The challenges are like this. Same with score and bobblehead.
---
The PC UI has it when in Build mode.
---
But bethesda doesn't.
---
There are a lot of things they could have done to generate easy money with the  atx shop and they just let it slip.
---
As example, we have the second communist pack on sale. Dataminers found a new communist outfit, why didn't they add it? There were a lot of such flaws, along other items that won't be accessible but are datamined for months now as the enclave pack.
---
I speculate that it might be server issues, since it's never happened on my Private.
---
The new endgame: club-hopping in the Apocalypse.
---
Depends on the individual preferences. Be25 harder hit per shot with explosive perks take enemies down in less bullets. But b2525 delivers bullets quicker, given it better dps. So if your trying to take high health enermies (bosses) down quicker use b2525. How ever perk card placement to your style of play is one of the most important things to be efficient and effective.
---
All we need to do is strap mines to all of them, let them blow eachother up and be done with this plague.
---
It pops up at the top of each hour, are you on at that time?
---
No need for google if one could read the question.
---
No, he's saying to do exactly that...and keep the lights low.  lol
---
Who cares if they buy it all you sold it and its gone?
---
I mean i sell all my Ultracite plans for 50 caps each and I barely move any I'd be happy if someone come and bought the lot.
---
No worries! 😁
---
Nice
---
Seen another pic like this a while back. Is pretty funny when they fall that way.
---
Yeah i am , maybe i am just unlucky or I’m stupid and i have been ignoring it , i dont know
---
holy shit! I never thought about the dome being 2nd floor. You are a genius
---
Depends on what challange are you talking about. If about the one where you need to kill specific types of enemies like albino, glowing etc. then yes, it may not count if you kill a glowing one
---
Or its gone for more then a year. X-01 Blackbird...
---
Right here, r/eyeblech
---
Dang, no wonder my Challenges are not completing
---
Welp you can swap out sneak perk cards for Dodgy and some other running perk cards. I swap out Vats luck perks for serendipity and ricochet too. 
---
I’m still quite tanky although dealing much less damage. But I’ll take it since it kinda should be a harder mode and I finally have use for my Loadout.
---
Also, how about body markers for non legendary ones too.
---
True
---
And how long ago did you find it?...
---
No, why should it?
---
Its just a camp item ffs.
---
Mole rats can always see you one they spot you. Even when burrowed underground. And there are a lot of them during the event
---
The blackbird paint came back &lt; 3 months ago I believe.
---
They absolutely do. The ones in Solstheim are almost always out of place, and the Solitude ones I've actually *SEEN* snapping back onto their platforms.
---
Its a nuclear bunker and it says it in the description... ok just making sure it was cosmetic and not actually useful
---
Yes. The first time after more then a year.
---
Yo unless you’re already invested in your nocturnal axe, I have a proposition for you:
---
Black Powder pistol build
---
Hear me out!
---
10 of those on the quick select wheel for hotswapping, all with different legendary effects for applying debuffs and such. Plus, Halloween isn’t far off, so Pirate Costumes are gonna be available again 🏴‍☠️
---
Bethesda has been doing a lot of grind instead of content lately. I think if they're going to replace the daily atom grind with a daily gold grind, then they should introduce new items to buy with gold.
---
So you can get these weapons as quest rewards now
---
Also on PS4. I frequently don't get a pop-up notification. The event still happens though, just need to remember to get there in time.
---
Oh, you're also better off going before it starts anyway - is usually finished before you know it
---
Its a camp item, nothing is blast secure. You can destroy the bunker wit a few rounds of any gun.
---
Do you also believe a pulovsky bunker save you from a nuke? Nothing does.
---
Explosive will break a tad faster and you will get hurt w splash damage.2525 is just amazing for anything
---
Ah ok , that would explain why I don’t see it thanks !
---
I did line in the sand once where the only help I had was one player doing a hanzo main and only using a bow to kill things.
---
I might as well of done it all myself because for every 20-30 scorch I was killing he killed about 3.
---
We failed as he refused to fix the generator or actually guard it whilst I was running round killing alot of s#$t just to stop us from being overrun by the f#$kers, horrible experience
---
This was my experience today. Three hours and not a one.
---
Nothing is being tested. Nor correctly or false.
---
You don't hear that sort of beeping noise with the bobble finder card active? It can normally lead me right to one...
---
I know this is correct...my inventory is pretty ridiculous...b2525 fixer and hm. Bex gatling  be cryolater. I hope they're not duped but I wouldn't bet money on it
---
This. With peoples afk on drums, the event is usually 50% finished before it even begins. A lot of times the actual event is only about two minutes long, it’s quite easy to miss if you’re not there at the top of every hour.
---
Yeah, thank you, the only difference is he literally stood there looking around
---
That’s a bit rude. No need for that
---
Have serums i can sell you, currently at work but can sort you out when I'm home :)
---
It’s part of Wastelanders quest, among other surprises.   Don’t want to spoil anything, so won’t say more unless asked
---
And it's so expensive to keep fast-travelling across the map to find one!
---
The thing is I really like this game but I just can't play with less than 20 fps.
---
Part of the settlers quests I beleave :)
---
I did that back in beta at level 10... I regret nothing.
---
Oh I already did it, but with the raiders only ahahah
---
Cry me a river.
---
Seeing this question about 10 times this week.
---
Why asking such stupid questions? Ofc they are not blast secure. Ofc they are false advertised. Everyone should know it already...
---
Gonna do the settler quest line with a new character soon 🙂
---
It didn't back in beta they must of changed jt.
---
Im having the same problem it is not counting my queen kills or flatwoodsmonster  mothman and grafton momster kills
---
Ngl thought the header was about removing caps. Like the lil bottle caps
---
Like idk what has you so upset that this person’s question has you responding in this kind of way... but chill out my dude.
---
Bingo.   I did both factions up the the final decision point.   Part of one of the settlers quest.  And a few “hidden” things for anyone to find.
---
If only you were a developer, we might be saved after all
---
In this case, since i was still leveling this character and moving camp a lot i just made something with a low footprint so it's easy to plop down in new places.
---
I totally agree but at this stage, I can't see them adding it that way
---
Hehe I did find it before the settlers quest :D
---
Gonna do settler soon, just have already done it but I'm focusing on legendary run for now
---
It's should have been in since the start of the game
---
Actually a well built bunker could actually save you from a nuke. Unless perhaps detonated right above it. I mean, look at the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. It’s still largely standing and wasn’t even a bunker. Now serves as a peace memorial but it is an indication that structures can withstand a blast. So a nuclear bunker withstanding a nuclear blast is not that silly to believe.
---
Well, some i found because someone dumped them into a stations containers. Some i where gifted by other players. Some i just bought in vendors. Some i got from legendary vendor or as reward. Some i traded with my buddy. Who got them the same ways.
---
This isn't a bad idea.
---
I'm on console so I can place a wall write out in neon and take a picture and use it.
---
Not unfinished content. Added with wastelanders. Do the new main quest!
---
153 doesn't mean anything
---
Bloodied builds will be still the top tier. I’m running heavy gunner PA build with B/FFR minigun, 50. cal, lmg and gatling laser, so nerf won’t affect me that much. That’s how it should be - more damage for the price of low HP.
---
Yeah same here 😅
---
Even more if people are cooking too. I don't remember it being like this last time.
---
Also legendary robots explode and fly somewhere far away and just disappear
---
It may be similar but I took this screenshot yesterday.
---
Nope. Hasn't been figured out yet. Maybe because one of the ingredients is Brahmin milk.
---
Xmas one looks kinda cool.candy cane knives I think
---
How about if you scrap it.. You learn a plan for it but can only craft for yourself no dropping.  Tired of holding all the clothes from events
---
Sigh....
---
Were talking about the game, fallout. An item of this game. An mechanic of this game. Its all just (spaghetti)code, there is something like "if camp in blast zone on impact -&gt; all boom". No exceptions. Not even a small bunker which gets destroyed with 5 shots. Don't compare reality with shitcode in fallout or any other game.
---
Nope, but its cool that it does. Bonus!
---
I think some early quests use too. Some low level events maybe too but it’s not a common thing
---
I've probably killed the queen upwards of 50 times and still haven't managed to get the challenge to proc. Cheers Beth!
---
100% agree with you my friend!If it’s purveyor sale it should be for everything 🙄
---
Hey stims and water still drop and I still sell those like hot cakes
---
Congratulations my man! As a few tips on destroying them robots, start saving up those legendary weapons that do extra dmg to robotos! It's best to do silos with people, because you may crash inside, so then the other person can help you out and lunch it for you. Also maybe prepare extra megazines and bobbleheads. 🤔 Good luck in future nuking! 👌
---
One spawns ontop of the structure that has the black water mine entreance, you just have to walk up the rocks behind it and drop down.
---
Yeah, the queen one is bugged and cannot be completed.  There are rumors floating around that you need to land the killing blow for it to count but that is just BS.  I have soloed her on multiple occasions and it still is not checked off.  It's been like that for at least a year if not since launch.
---
Everytime I check a med box it’s empty about 80 percent of the time that it is full.
---
Aww I clicked on your comment and was saddened when I couldn't see a picture
---
It's come back a few times since it first dropped, and they haven't discounted it yet, possibly meaning that every time it sells well.
---
It'll definitely come back.
---
I by all means never rely on dropped items from events. I craft a lot and sell a lot in my vendor but I wouldn’t mind getting disease cures over other items like heavy combat armor left arms and mini nukes.
---
At my first nuke I sweat a lot.  
---
But the sweet victory brought me lasting satisfaction.
---
It a smart money move the atoms challenges dont complete the people that need atoms to complete the score run only option to buy atoms to complete run after runs over challenges magically fixed lol
---
OP's point here is that it actually says so in the Atom shop text, so another half "false" advertising  ...
---
What outfit are you using? Looks really cool
---
Its a good chunk of atoms and its weird because my grafton monster kills count on other challenges but not others
---
Because something is wrong with them.  😉
---
Fo76map dot com, click hide all, then select bobble heads. Click or press each marker for a more detailed description of the location. You are welcome.
---
Its been working for me. 
---
Either way, I have a few extra chally heads if you want one!
---
Play with a team you know. Keep an eye out on things they might need and have them do the same. My wife and I play together. We help each other with everything.
---
I don't know you but.... you can do better!
---
Oh my god buddy. This worked!!
---
Thank you so much! I will edit it in the description for other people who might have the same problem. 
---
Thanks again!!
---
... nice one bethesda
---
They should revert back to Atoms.
---
That's him
---
I don't believe it's purposeful, just incompetent on their part
---
oh that would make sense (milk)
---
Very nice, i once used the greenhouse dome in a build as well but could not get over the fact that it rains inside :/, good job lining it up tho :)
---
Yes, but I don't think they want to do that. Other rewards would be fine to me too.
---
erm... something something Volt 76?
---
I would love to play some Fallout 76, but the limited storage really sucks the fun out of the game. I've been doing inventory tetris for almost 3 decades and it's gotten real old. Nowadays when I start a new Oblivion/Skyrim run pretty much the first thing I mod is the carry weight same for Witcher 3. It really helps the immersion, when you can freely explore for longer periods of time and don't constantly need to sell/store your stuff, or leave all the cool stuff behind.
---
Hope you didn't want the Chinese stealth suit.  You can still get it but it will cost you 5000 bullion for the suit and helmet combined instead of just getting it for free.
---
I did, better frame rates and I can find things on the ground.
---
Both are good guns. Use Explosive for everyday mobs, use FFR on queens. FFR will use a lot more ammo
---
There is if you're on console and can only use exploits (cant run scripts).
---

Pretty soon you'll be able to buy Lunchboxes. I'm hoping they add more consumables.
---
That has been added back for us just FYI
---
Between waves I try to step on them and set them off
---
I've never had it happen and I always login around 4/5 hours *after* reset. I never check Atom Shop or the Legendary Run until *after* I'm in a world too.
---
Tato is more of a tomato in the game. So not a potato.
---
I did answer his question without any doubt, I also wasn't rude or are you such a softie that you feel offended of a simple ffs?
---
Who are you, a professional social justice warrior? Go and answer his questions if you feel the need to help someone or want to do it better.
---
It allows me to get mad caps by selling antibiotics and disease cures I craft.
---
I hope they won't remove survival elements, it could have strong negative economy and caps inflation issues.
---
Wish food wasn't perishable so I could craft and sell it too.
---
yeah, i did not use PA on my main but started a new character after wastelanders that i'm building specifically for it, but since i knew of some spawns, chassis have been easy to get and by the time i was 35 i had a full suit off lvl 50 T60 in my stash, now i'm 46 and finished all but "I have become death", forgot you get the x-01 specs for free, so i'll be building that when i hit 50 :p
---
It is actually botulism that often kills people IRL potato salads. Something about the mayo(eggs specifically getting warmed in Sun).
---
That's weird, I swore bling I saw it somewhere and was getting masses of xp on Thursday and Friday night... Even have screenshots of 800xp+ for a single stingwing kill at the cranberry bog prime cuts events.. Now I'm baffled, appreciate your reply dude. 2000xp+ for the behemoth at the end to... Very weird.
---
I mean your response to him was rude. Like could you have been more rude? Sure, but you could have also been neutral or pleasant, which you weren’t.
---
Thanks for explaining the obvious. Regardless of that knowledge, I still went there. 
---
And regardless of that knowledge, an item that says NUCLEAR BUNKER, could be expected to withstand a nuclear blast. If you knew the answer, a simple “no” would have sufficed. Additional information could have been your experience with it. I don’t know what’s going on in your life but you should stop taking it out on people on the internet.
---
My first nuke, I died to a random explosion in the reactor room. It was fun.
---
Haha. If i knew it before i'd do a lot of arms. Use 2 X-01 legs with Calibrated shocks. 2 ultracite arms with one of them jetpack mod. Escavator Torso for the 4x mining yield. And T65 helmet with the targetting mod.
---
This is why I put skins on my personal gear, they can’t see it in trade.
---
They should have not released screen shots of the location before wastelanders.  It was cool finding it anyways, but would have been better to find not knowing that such a location existed already.  Looks like something from a completely different game.
---
They are pretty reasonable. Got on for my xbox external for half of what they were a year ago it seemed.
---
You get one clap 
---
*clap*
---
But no more...
---
Turn off gore,, this helps the most, no looking for loot so long anymore
---
That's exactly what they mean.
---
You are talking about a completely different thing. The change if for damage, not everything.
---
I do the same. But some guns don't have skins, mainly my gat plasmas and gat lasers
---
Are you 100% sure It doesn't apply to other effects?
---
Does it still give 4x Ore when mining? Thanks!
---
Is there a list what items are available? I have the cow costume a few times now, but I guess that there is much more, that I didn't get yet. At the moment I am a bit fed up by the meat events to collect the meat. Most of the time I am alone or the event is bugged in a way that time runs out or no enemies appear for a long time and then finally time runs out...
---
Read PTS patch notes
---
Most people would prefer that daily challenges autocompleted themselves and rewarded with score automatically.
---
Dailies like Kill a deathclaw were kinda fun, actually had to go out and use my past game knowledge where I could find them.
---
Any new challenge added literally creates 20 angry Reddit posts of people who can only spend few minutes in game daily.
---
3456 now. I have f1st so i pick up literally everything. 11k wood 8k steel (use alit for 2mm ammo) 12k lead etc. Tato/Mutfruit/Corn/Water farm for adhesive (8k) and every flux at least 300x. Hardest material is Fiber Optics. I try to get as much materials as possible before i cancel the subscription.
---
I was told ap refresh got Fdup completely in the pts.
---
Is it possible that these Stealth nerfs were designed to go hand-in-hand with the Perk Loadout system they're supposed to be working on? Like you click on one loadout for Adventure, and one of several others depending on Daily Ops?
---
Once applied, are you able to change the skin and possibly Trade it?
---
Cool thanks for the info, everyone's camps look awesome with it!
---
It's harmless. Even after shooting it. It flies away . Been trying to kill that one for ages.
---
Because they want the guns, stop bitching and just request their whole inventory
---
Cursed weapons for 3k to 5k... stop it, they are not that rare.
---
If it has a similar buff as green thumb I’d be all for it. I hate having to change my perk cards, I typically forget to put them back.
---
Where is the Unsee Button?

I left my game on while I was on the drums yesterday from when I got home at 3 and came back to the game at like 9. In that time I got 3 chally outfits, 2 masks, 1 chef's hat and no Tenderizer plan. I. Need. It.
---
That’d be great
---
If you're on PC you can turn grass clutter off in the ini files, it's alleviates the problem a little bit when it comes to not being able to find the corpses. But I definately agree it needs fixing
---
The same thing happened to me on the first event, we didn't manage to kill him like this either.
---
They spawn literally everywhere. If you equip the Perceptibobble perk you notice how much you look over them before
---
Cosmetic only :)
---
If you want something that is high end at least shoot me a message as well. Should be painfully obvious I'm not just going to give it to them
---
I don't mind having a conversation with people if they want to ask after them. But to request them in a trade menu just seems a bit daft to me ya know?
---
I'll take a Vampire's over a Troublshooter's any day when dealing with assaultrons.
---
Well how about you just answer "no"?
---
No? Well then go on and be the social justice warrior who fights for his own feel for rights! You doing a great job, while I did indeed answered his question with the flavor that sometimes its better to use its own head instead of trusting fake advertise.
---
Awesome!
---
Could also add in an effect that walking near plants helps them grow quicker, like the fertiliser grenade (can’t remember their name lol)
---
I literally find them so much that i did the 'use 76 bobbleheads' challenge and still my display has all 20.
---
These PvE events won't be fun as long hacked and magic weapons exists.
---
Were they ever correct or at least complete?
---
This.
---
The bar goes down eventually if only 1 or maybe even 2 are doing the passive with no active players in the event. I found myself in that situation and switched from playing drums to collecting
---
Yes! The Recharger Pistol is my go-to whenever I start a new game (I can usually find one on a dead Bright Brotherhood member under a bridge North(?) of Goodsprings. I save caps up for the MF Hyperbreeder Alpha from the start.
---
Do you ? My Psn is Priest1503 Thank you kind sir
---
Trust your feelings, do you think Bethesda would make it nuke blast proof? Do polowski shelters work? Does anything work as it should first time? ( or any time for that matter)
---
I'm thinking it doesn't
---
I have all types and sell them for 75 caps each. A lot of traffic in my camp but noone buys them
---
Don't understand how what I said is wrong but okay, I was trying so simplify things, what a bunch of snowflakes lols.
---
280 yesterday. Let's go to 300!
---
We can't have shit because some of y'all don't know how to keep it low.
---
My grandmother and I launched our first nuke today too. The silo was a bit crazier than I expected but it was great fun.
---
Grats on your nuke, hope you launch many more!
---
Congrats!!
---
It is, in fact, both.
---
It's because of the 2 min countdown, the drums and spits work during that time before everything else kicks off giving the meter a serious head start.
---
I've been at a cook off that lasted less than a minute after the countdown
---
I wanna see an x-01 power armor with jeans and ranch hand clothes painted on it
---
They're already massively discounted over regular equipment.
---
Just say what you really mean.
---
"I don't want to play this game at all, I just want the best items in the game given to me for logging in then I can quit."
---
Oh my god, not what I thought of but that’s gold
---
Sometimes it's by it's self. I like the plushies.
---
I usually server hop sons of dane until I find the one there. Normally get it in around 5-10 tries. It's on top of the speaker in the left corner of the stage under the staircase if you go looking.
---
They're already massively discounted over other gear.  NO, they should not be included in the sale, that would be stupid.
---
I prefer my b5025. I don't need fire rate when I kill everything in 2 shots top. But extra crit+crit perk on mega bosses does make a difference.
---
\*ahem\* class action lawsuit. Is that still going btw?
---
It's patched on pts,so just wait till september.
---
Why don’t you make space?
---
Massively discounted? 
---
50% off sale should include everything.
---
No AFK'ing on one toon only.... 
---
I shit you not;
---
Day 1- Backpack, Chally outfit, bloody chef outfit, bloody chef hat, grill cooking station plan. 
---
Day 2- Grillmaster Hat, Meat Week Flag, Backpack #2, Tenderiser Plan, Chally Head/Mask. 
---
Day 3- Cleaver Plan, Chally outfit #2, Meat Week Flag #2. [First working day, Monday in Australia so I missed some time] 
---
Serious I've got mods and a Tato Salad plan (which I think I did get already but not sure) to go and I think Ive had a clean sweep? 
---
My RNG is disgraceful normally. This isn't what normally happens to me!
---
I made a stupid decision today and put a bunch of old Halloween plans up for super, *super* cheap today in the hopes that they'd reach multiple people. Instead some dude on my team and his bud came and snapped all them up. Totally foolish oversight on my part for not spreading them out (I get lazy when it comes to restocking and do it in bursts), but still felt bad. :/
---
I was asking to make sure, Not trying to debate.
---
It clearly states in the description it shields from nuclear blasts.
---
Other CAMP items have a purpose like ammo converter, collectrons, rain water collector, refrigerator... why would I have to automatically assume that CAMP things are strictly cosmetic?
---
Is it really so far fetched to think a nuclear bunker would withstand a nuclear blast, specially when it clearly states it in the description? 
---
Anyway I got my answer thanks
---
sexist
---
This is the reason I haven't responded to random trade invitations in for over a year. I might have missed a few opportunities where a duper intended to sell me end gear for cheap that way, but that's for the better, too, I figure.
---
Its always my traveling leather coat. That they can see my character is currently wearing. It's literally the shirt off my back for someone random? I keep thinking maybe its folks are looking for a sucker that doesn't know somethings worth.
---
Probably because it's now immune to crippling wings and therefore it's more difficult to force her to land.
---
I sell my masks 1000 to 1500 simply because I get a lot of traffic and sell about 1 a week. Not as fast as I’d like but people still pay for them.
---
I think it would've been far too expensive for any pre war farmer to afford a specialised suit of power armor. The US prior to the bombs dropping was in a resource drought and economic recession on top of being at war w/ China. Would need to be a new suit likely designed by the settlers.
---
Yeah guy just requested my responders fireman outfit. That I'm wearing. I'm a level 370, with multiple legecys and rocking the hellfire pa paint. They should know they're not going to pull on over on me haha
---
Your powers are weak padawan, go play animal crossing.....
---
The SBQ won't notice you while sneaking but a mole rat in prime cuts can see you beyond Line of Sight. So stupid.
---
Yeah, make death even less punishing, like it isn't anyway. It should be normal that we die all the time... 
---
Sometimes I wish the survival servers settings back... just to let people feel how bad a death should be.
---
Every single time
---
B2525 is better in the queen and fires faster, more bullets=more dps
---
I never expect end game gear, but I want to see what plans they might have, or hope for some fuel (flamers are hungry bastards). And I want them to do the same, I'm happy to give people ammo I don't use
---
Like going from stealth perks to PA perks?
---
Wish I could gift you one
---
Did I stutter?
---
Yea me too. Good items for the shelf glitch. But since a half year I didn't see it in the shop. And I check everyday the shop sale side....
---
Death should have at least some consequences
---
the reason they don’t stack is because they’re treated as armor, not to prevent duping. otherwise nothing would stack.
---
Ok,   
---
Replace it by randomly loosing one of your legendary weapon or armor or all your ammo.
---
We always assume we’re doing “the right thing”. Do you ever question if what you do is “the right thing”? And have you come to the conclusion that that only exists in the subjectivity of the person?
---
You have not set them up to think for themselves. You were being unnecessarily rude in conveying your message. You were condescending. Without any reason to be. I’m not really a fan of “social justice warriors” and I don’t like people that vomit their rudeness online or wherever and excuse themselves by implying “they’re doing a good thing” or “I’m just being honest”. You can be honest without being rude. Diplomacy comes to mind.
---
OP was using their own head by coming to r/fo76 and asking others if they knew if the Nuclear Bunker could withstand a nuclear blast. 
---
You simply assume that every C.A.M.P. item is destroyed by a nuclear blast. Which is also understandable given that most items are broken when a nuclear blast hits. But you’re not leaving any room for exceptions. In this case “a Nuclear Bunker”. If there would ever be an exception for a C.A.M.P. item to be able to withstand a nuclear blast. It would be the Nuclear Bunker. Is it likely? Maybe not, considering the rest of the items. But you don’t really know for sure unless your Nuclear Bunker actually get’s hit by a nuclear blast. Which the OP has not experienced since they have not purchased the item yet depending on the answer of the question they posed. 
---
“Using their own head” would be asking the question to people who do have it, and actually KNOW that it can or cannot withstand a nuclear blast. Rather than to simply assume that it doesn’t because every other C.A.M.P. item doesn’t. The latter is not using your head. It’s being lazy.
---
wich guy wich notes help!
---
Yeah, it should honestly be ammo, aid and junk when you die. Also, trigger the 'help me' sequence more instead of instantly killing the player
---
Happening to me as well. Have tried on different days. Every time I log back in it says to insert the fuse. I insert the fuse and attempt to analyze the sample, tells me the sample hasn't been inserted.
---
Too bad we can't share atom stuff. I'd go around dropping different ones at different places
---
Tony Stark: So you just want to look out for the neighborhood, help out the little guy?
---
Vertibot: Yes, sir, yes, just a friendly neighborhood Vertibot.
---
Tl;dr
---
She still dies pretty easy for me. As long as she lands a few times....
---
You will never get lucky for trades if you don’t ask. I have bought some nice bloodied stuff off non-bloodied players. Heck, I even have had players walk up to me and sell bloodied gear as well.
---
Well it's made by the Red Chinese, what do you think?
---
I just dump all unwanted gear outside my front door, cba being a good samaritan anymore, too much pita to chase down low levels anymore
---
I have tried to do the event about 5 times on Xbox. So far, it has failed to start or the game has crashed halfway through the event every time....
---
Nope. Just couldn't quite understand you with your head so far up your own ass.
---
Tbh I dont buy any skin or weapon from the shop because it's pretty stupid that you can't just buy an atom shop outfit that goes over whatever non pa stuff youre wearing.
---
Thank you for confirming my suspicion about you.
---
Does the rain collector only gather water when it rains or every couple of minutes like other water collecting items.
---
The stealth suit helmet said it protects from airborne and waterborne diseases yet only protects you from the latter.
---
Just because Bethesda states in their descriptions  it doesn't say it's true, it's fluff to make you buy it or collect it
---
This is why I don’t accept random trade invites.
---
I want less teleporting dogs
---
I 100% understand what you are saying - and am roughly hitting the same dilemma.
---
I've been playing the game for going on 2 months.  I'm now at the point where....
---
1.  I have 5 mules (a 2nd account) fully loaded with legendaries to turn into script.
---
2.  I have 300+ treasury notes.  
---
3.  Am fast approaching level 300.  
---
Advancing right now requires 3 things for me - all gated.  Rep.  Gold.  Script.  I don't mind the rep - since that one will be 100% gone when I finish it.  
---
If I could turn in more script/legendary notes - I'd have reason to keep playing.  Now - I'm contemplating taking a few week break - logging in just to do the reputation.  
---
Now - I do ENJOY the grind.  To some extent.  But there needs to be some reward;  and I'm at the point where the rewards (for example, legendary weapons) are a borderline hindrance, as I'm running out of places to stash it.
---
Very good point!  
---
Geez, it makes me reticent to scrap much o anything until I see the Perk Loadout system.  Do we know when that's theoretically going to be released?
---
Better to just ask.
---
IM’s exist for a reason.
---
Mid tier gear is one thing. If I'm carrying a halfway decent piece of gear, yeah go ahead and ask. But asking for my Ve plasma, je gattling laser, and stuff like that should be a no brainer. I'd never ask for someone god tier stuff like that
---
As mentioned before adding in announcements for events etc. _would_ add the local radio vibe.
---
Rumor has patch 22, but I expect 23 or 24, given Bethesda's record so far.
---
&gt; Just do primal cuts a few times a lot this week. I’m sitting at 100+ notes just from primal cuts alone this week
---
I'm sitting at 300+ treasury notes.  Which is part of the problem ....
---
Yeah, and I'm happy to answer a message. But to just request in the trade menu and not shoot me a message bugs me a bit. Not much, but like a midge bite haha
---
July I believe, got dropped at WSS
---
Based
---
Please for the all that is holy
---
I've seen it fail often enough this time even with everyone contributing, and I've seen events struggle for the whole 8 minutes, and then complete at a lower tier. I prefer the insta-complete events as I'm there for the rewards, the drop rate is abysmal for me, server-hop double-dipping doesn't work as well as with Fasnacht, and so it's one chance per hour.
---
Understood.
---
I should probably start selling flamer fuel....
---
Oh that would be nice
---
Same... like almost exactly but I was probably like L15.
---
I've had a few good ones, and I'm always on the look out for plans and fuel. And I'm happy to sell or give people stuff when they ask for reasonable things. I love trading, it's just so clunky in this game haha
---
missile silos, in the mainframe section
---
At what pricing? I've had bunch in my vendor for weeks now and it doesn't move.
---
Oh, it really is. They need a better system...and a “handshake” confirmation.
---
Moo Moo cute no?
---
&gt; This only works well for people that can only play on the weekends. Waiting a day for my scrip limit to reset is difficult, I cant imagine waiting a week for it.
---
Your comment is illogical.
---
It would benefit everyone.
---
This feels like on of those issues Bethesda would look into and next update will roll out perma death thinking that's what was asked for.
---
Fuel is a good seller with all the duped legacy flamers floating around. I'll buy all fuel I find at 1c a piece. They're hard to keep fed and I love running them.
---
Also people who actually tend to look at what you request often just give you the fuel since they don't use it
---
Oh me too! I claim sunshine to get non perishable food to sell. But I really wish food wouldn’t expire, I’d be crafting cranberry meatball grinders for everyone
---
I solo that shit  easy peasy, so you "Steam rolling" it obviously is not the case, I dont need to repair it at all, coz I actually steamroll it.
---
&gt; 🤦‍♂️ So, you want less flexibility and fewer caps/script per week? If you want it to turn in at 8 est, nothing is stopping you.
---
Assuming most of us have a semi-regularly sleep schedule, the 4 hour variance means you aren't going to be pulling in an extra day a week.
---
I got the raven mask and someone started messaging me about name my price they’ll get or give me whatever I want I told them it wasn’t for sale I like it it’s mine eventually I had to block them
---
Yeah im Gonna bail on this game and resume playing no mans sky.
---
Stims: 6
---
Water: 3 
---
Super stims: 16
---
Disease cures: 6 or 16 depends on how they sell
---
&gt; I'm happy to give people ammo I don't use
---
I used to do that, too, but usually by just dropping it wherever, but since the ammo converter became a thing I'm keeping all that sweet .44 ammo. ;-)
---
The thing is energy weapons were never strong in the first place.
---
Ah, the Stealth Suit MK II...I miss her.
---
I'm wondering if it's private server vs. public?
---
I have about a 90% non-bug rate on the primal meat events on a private server.  On the public servers, it seems to be more like 70%.  (which I think is - you get loss spawns if you are solo/private server - so less mobs to go running away).
---
Obviously you have a better build than me, good for you, I'm still working on mines but I have the basics, I am a heavy gunner/bloodied sneak commando, I'm building a commando character though, if I used my BE gatling plasma then I would of steam rolled it easily
---
Both Epic in my opinion, I put both above the Fixer versions. I use the B2525 for stealth (suppressor), playing a bit more tactucal, I use the BE25 when I just want to obliterate everything and not be bothered about how much noise I make.
---
Lmao I'll start calling her that
---
So what do you suggest they do instead when you die? Your proposal would make zero consequence to death.
---
Depends if you have enough intelligence to run demo expert 5.....
---
\&gt;  probability 
---
That's the most succinct way of saying "bad code, superficial testing and poor quality assurance" I've ever seen.
---
&gt; Also, I never see dead servers. But in on PC, not sure if consoles are different.
---
I'm also on PC.  I had only *rarely* ever seen dead servers... but more common now with this.  That said - outside the first 12 hours of the bbq event - I have not had it fail.  Even more so - 90% of the time it's done in &lt; 2 minutes on PC.  
---
My assumption though - it's due to people logging in at the same time.  So not so much about dead servers, as much as fresh servers.
---
I mean no offense, but this a multiplayer game, trade, for fuck's sake, lmao.
---
Because they're idiots?
---
Nice! You always remember your first.
---
They can see you before they even exist.... Before the spawn cycle it's already full blown detection and they haven't materialised. 
---
Lord help the bloodied kids with CSA. They're fucked in this. Surely gotta be dying a ton.
---
I don't even loot legendaries anymore unless it's a 3 star and I still have scrip left that day. Otherwise it goes into the void. A waste? Yes. But my time is more valuable than making 4 mule accounts and constantly switching between them. I wish Bethesda would acknowledge this.
---
Last night I didn’t catch the time and played during reset, Lost 100% of the challenges. 2nd time playing through he reset and 2nd time losing a chunk of score. Pretty damn shocking bug
---
Yes, I recently crafted a fat load of ammo so I have no ammo, going to do a West tek run soon
---
Might have to test this after work tomorrow
---
I like having a daily connected to exploration. I could make it easy for myself and server hop, but I rather search the place and travel to the next till I find one. I could equip the perk, but you can guess the sneaky locations where they are.  
---
Camden Park, Tyler County Fairgrounds, Watoga, Wavy Willard's Waterpark, Camp Venture and Huntersville, all have 3 different spawn points and never let me down.  
---
On the desk in Black Bear Lodge's basement, next to the computer that gives the Hunter Daily.  That one is almost always there on a private server (for me, my friends have other regular spots that I never see).
---
True 😜
---
Dont follow the lore much?... Mr.Farmhands were so successful, farmers didnt actually farm at all, no need for power armor on the farm. But I say make one anyways cuz dats one nice looking set of equipment. Green and Yellow John Deere Power Armor set, Im in... also I want a "Power Loader" PA skin from Alien... "Get away from her you B!tch!"
---
I don't accept trade invites. I got tired long ago of having some rando request my mainline gear.
---
stalking will attack you but leave when it gets to half health. but you can kill it before it flies off
---
Well, we get all the meat to cook for ourselves by killing critters for the critter chunks. Then Grahm gives us a plan for a side dish? Haha. It may be a gift from both he and Chally, and that explains the veggie side of things - Grahm knows that some creatures do need more than just meat to survive. As far as it feeding carnivores, I imagine thats because it wouldn’t be fair to award a plan that wouldn’t benefit everyone? (Plus some of the plant plans are bugged, I’ve noticed, and do offer benefits to Carnivores. Not sure if intentional.)
---
So yeah. A lot of possibilities for what Grahm/Bethesda was thinking here.
---
It should.. I think...
---
Someone made a post about the spawns at Lost Home a few weeks back and now in use those when I need a bobblehead. It took just two server jumps, but one spawns in the little crate by where the settlers sit at the Lost Home.
---
I've been watching a bunch of your vids man - doing Atom's work right there.
---
Ok. Good stuff. Be easier (and cheaper) if they consumed 1 power each, but I guess I'll be bleeding stuff off of them.
---
If I understand this correctly:
---
 - As long as there is numeric power, it will continue to path
---
 - It paths along the first leg first, then the second
---
 - This is why you bleed power of the first leg at the end
---
 - When it destroys itself it also drops the down-stream power
---
Are the multiple power connectors there on the ground to make the subsequent paths "longer" and determine order? Or is it order-placed?
---
If I have the trigger on an infrequently used location, I could maybe have it light up every few minutes ... this is good ... what I'd like would be for it to run w/o my intervention for 30 min or so until I return and repair.
---
but it makes it so much easier to complete the radtoad projectile egg thingy challenge for 40 atoms
---
I never sell ammo for more than 1 cap each.
---
is it so much to ask to add a trade system like in diablo 2.... or path of exile, or borderlands, or any game that allows currency and item trades at the same time lol.
---
Adds some jeopardy to the game.  Not as if you lose progress or weapons.
---
I've seen that vendor there a few times an way before meat week that's indeed another encounter spot for that vendor.
---
I afk at it while at work. But even before I saw reddit posts on the event I make the macro so that my character would be in the spits turning the whole time so that it would help complete the event.
---
Just most people are too lazy to spend 1 min making a macro to turn the spits or play drums. Even saw one guy hiding in stealth armor so to try and not be seen leeching off the event. I end up server hopping when I see things like this to not help them for the next round.
---
Fair enough
---
They did. That server got a good laugh.
---
Sigh* let her land and the mele players can demolish her.  Just make sure you get 1k damage in.
---
I didn't feel any changes to AP refresh - I have full set of AP refresh armor and it's fills up same way as on live servers. Changes only affected damage calculations. In my opinion for much worse and I really considering playing muuuuch less if not quiting completely...
---
I launched my first last week. It was a pain in the ass actually. I arrived at the silo, started working my way in, but the power plant stuff wouldn't work. As it turned out, there was already a team in the silo in the process of launching, and I couldn't catch up. So I had to get out, wait, then go in a different silo. It took forever, but I got it done.
---
If they weren't there the game would have put other people in the server that might have actually helped. 9 people is almost half the server limit.
---
Unlikely, seeing as that would be worth more than the game itself in RWT...
---
Thank God I have a heavy build and a bloodied. Upcoming Daily OPs and Collosal Problem are not for my bloodied gal. She dies way too much. Those events are for my heavy build  with Furious and Vampire lazers. Prime cuts is way easier with my heavy as well.
---
You get all helm mods for free. Just go mod it out
---
They’ve screwed with it a couple of times in response to the exploit where players could clip through the door and the map and also it to build camps under the map - what you see today is the result of those ‘attempts’. In the PTS it is now a no-camp zone suggesting either it will stay that way as a final solution to the camp exploit and/or a new NW map will cover that area.
---
24 seconds - that was how long the cook out I was just at took
---
If you don't mind swapping cards, why not both? The system seems pretty flexible.
---
It might not be the strongest, but [here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=a65858e&amp;d=sg2sv3sa2eh2lg2l71lt2lu2li2po2pp2cu0cm2ib4s72a00ek1an2ao0c72&amp;w=p30p40ln0l00l60l90lj2lf0lm2c52cr0eg1ce0cj1c81e20pa0p80p90&amp;m=01c9fe8)'s a mock-up that should be useable at the very least.
---
I'm not really trying to min-max my character, either. Mostly going for things I just thought were cool, or change how I play the game a bit.
---
No, if they weren't there they would be somewhere else on the map.
---
Also, if they were replaced, who says the new players wouldn't afk aswell? Repeat this till you have only empty servers.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/eyunzXD.png](https://i.imgur.com/eyunzXD.png)  This too lol
---
u/Baronik it's harder? that's good. I always feel like this game is not challenging even a bit...
---
Tomorrow at update most likely
---
Ah yes, the "Line in the sand". Love how people just destroy my mines that I put for enemy spams so I can do a lil aoe dmg and they can finish them! Or when a 800 lvl guy just one hit everything, especially legendary Scortchbeast. Great memories!
---
i lead enemies, especially my favourite, the mirleurk king, to players at scorched earth every chance i get. 
---
it's about spreading the XP around. :)
---
some people are so ungrateful.
---
We can’t target enemies in some quests, but damnit we need to know about those eggs in VATS!
---
I'm fairly certain it has to do with how the projectile eggs are coded. They work exactly like mines - which you can target and shoot so they don't explode on you - so that's why that happens. They'd have to overhaul the egg projectiles to fix it - or they could just get rid of them all together. (I'm in favor of that.)
---
This is the power of the mole rat. Even ones in the SBQ fights can see you at all times, the scorpions too.
---
\&gt;  especially with the SCORE system incentivizing this 
---
Ironically, because of the level up requirement EVERY SINGLE DAY, I often choose to STOP playing when I'm getting close to the next level and want to save it for tomorrow's score challenge.  I have 3 to 4 guys and we all do the same thing.  Oh, I'm about to level.  See you guys after 12pm tomorrow!   I realize this is a me problem, but Bethesda has managed to incentivize me to NOT play their game at a certain point.  How screwed up is that?
---
Yeah I run full health but my stealth rifleman is gonna be converted to full auto monster and I won't even attempt to hide. From what's coming out of the PTS I am not sure how viable stealth will be anymore.
---
Ya they could be somewhere else or afk. That's why I said might help instead of the current ones guaranteed not helping. If you have all the drums and spits in use even with afk people. I don't think you can fail the event. Don't think you'll get beat reward tier but I don't think you'll fail. Cause with the 2 min count down timer you start the event at tier 2 rewards and the up tic from them is about the same as the events down tic.
---
And they're treated as armor to prevent d00ping my dude.
---
I like the fact that it is possible to make a living in Fo76 from buying low and selling high.  
---
I price very low and have this happen to me to. The other week I sold a AAE handmade for 3K to a friend, who then sold the item for 13K.   
---
I look at it this way: I price low so stuff moves quickly and my stash isn't filled to the max for long. If other players want to buy and resell at higher price, the items will fill stash space for a longer period (on average and assuming they do not go on trade fora). I put almost zero effort in for selling stuff while my friend takes the time to trade on the trade fora. I throw in my gear in vanilla state, he mods whatever he sells.  
---
For me, pricing stuff is always the same question: how fast does this need to move from my stash? Am I okay with this price if it means it moves fast?
---
Looks more like he's doing whatever that old timey Cossack dance is called.
---
How long is this stupid grind supposed to take? I've rolled almost 100 SS chestpieces, only gotten 3 unyielding rolls, one was a 1 star and the other two were 2 star rolls with charisma and perception.
---
I'm afraid to buy any other pieces before I get a usable chestpiece. I'm already unable to get even one decent piece, I don't see myself getting 5, ever.
---
Even improved repair kits for on the fly repairs be nice to buy with bullion. No one doing SBQ this weekend due to meat week &amp; collossus so I’ve ran out of improved repair kits &amp; I refuse to buy atom ones.
---
I want one tbh
---
Doesn't Skyrim have a see dead spell. Why couldn't they find a way to port that code over to 76. Instead of a spell have like see dead people glasses.
---
Why ask for ridiculously good gear? Because people are dumb enough to sell it. My friend just got the deal of a lifetime. He initiated a trade with someone random and ended up trading his lame nothing-special lmg for an explosive ammo gat plasma and the kid threw in extra stuff I don't even remember what else. My buddy didn't even know what a legacy weapon was til I told him last week and now he has one. I've never even seen one lol 😞
---
The game really did push and still does into stealth because of the multipliers. Would love to see perks fornpeople who relish the loud and rekt lifestyle. Sneaking all the time get annoying and it's fun to just go in and blast everything.
---
Basically all the new Wastelander stuff except for the bows.
---
Single most OP critter. Rad scorpions are the next level of F*** You!
---
Sometimes you just gotta empty a magazine into the room to announce your arrival ;)
---
It is a ***super*** sale, afterall. I'm with you, OP.
---
Think meat week is causing the servers to be wonky.  Launched on her twice last night.  First one was solo (nobody showed up) and took less than a minute once she landed.
---
Second one went on 20 minutes with 4 other people and my same weapons were doing hardly any damage.  Burned a thousands of rounds.
---
Flex post. I agree with commenter. Not everyone is as gifted and intelligent on trading as you are. Your expecting every human to act the same and then come on Reddit all day to understand how much stuff is worth.  Please.. no ones head is up there ass. People are trading. Maybe they think you will be the dumb one. 
---
And cool your level 370. Doesn’t mean shit for shit. Just that you have played many many hours. For all you know the level 40 guy you see, could have a level 800 toon. Level means nothing anymore. And I’m sure that’s not even your legacy. You probably spent weeks chasing one, and now u feel special
---
This, other then headlamps, which it still does not have.
---
🤔 my guess then they had some left over materials too and just handed them in at the next cook off aka the tactic at fasnacht
---
Don't think it'll ever get headlamps. Excavator and ultracite still don't have em haha
---
Why not decorate your camp a lil, add some confetti, a happy birthday wrriten on a wall, maybe prepare a happy bundle, which can be a bit of scrap, a bunch of toilet paper, cuz that is pretty expensive, a bunch nuclear key cards to blow up this party, congratulate them, and that's that. 🎉 You can always add a rare item that perhaps they had their eye on, but if it was that easy to get, they wouldn't look for it. Honestly just some bobbleheads, megazines, ammo and food with luck for another lucky year of fallout sounds pretty sweet. 😊
---
Yeah maybe they sense vibrations in the ground, or disturbances in the magnetic field kinda like how sharks "see" their prey.
---
You get to keep it.
---
It does seem that way sadly :(
---
It is part of why I'm switching from my stealth rifleman to a heavy weapons powerarmor user.
---
You dont need to max rep with both sides you just need to make sure you do both quest lines fully before you start the raid. What ever side you pick you will max put faster but in the end you will be able to max them both out after the raid still.
---
It's someones personal opinion if nerfing damage by half make game harder the fun way...
---
Yeah I definitely had some people running around to make it LOOK like they were helping, but really they were just staring at everyone else doing the work. Watching us run around like we were chickens with our heads cut off
---
Terminal entries are definitely trickier, you're right. It wouldn't be a bad idea to make the vault explorable in Adventure Mode maybe and then you could pick up/listen to/read everything in there. 
---
Honestly 3 minutes sometimes isn't long enough but I don't think I could deal with the lobby taking any longer.
---
Pretty sure bows are still broken and dont fire properly more than they should
---
Some times she just turns into a tank for some reason or other. I can't normally see her health going down with my b ffr gat plaz but some times I waste 5 cores and her health doesn't move just another bug.
---
It is not. You can max rep with both before or after the Vault Raid. In fact you probably should just do the Raid with whomever you want.
---
Depending on who you choose you DO get some clothes from the faction you pick, and it's the only way (as far as I know) to get them. They're nothing special. But as long as you got both factions to the "Side with ____" missions, then you're good to do the Raid.
---
A big benefit of doing the Raid sooner than later is that you can't get Treasury Notes until you do it, so all these Daily missions for them, a number of Events that pop up, you're missing out on precious Treasury Notes and working on the Gold Grind.
---
Pick whomever you'd like, get the Raid done, then work the Dailies afterwards to grind out max Rep. You'll also get a big rep boost for whomever you side with as long as you give them their share of the loot.
---
God knows, maybe 2025 at this point. They’ve not communicated very well about the release of this patch.
---
You could have gotten the 2x boost from a lunch box.
---
You do not have to max them both out before the raid and I recommend against it because you are missing out on treasury notes. The only thing you can miss is the stealth armor given to you by the settlers, but if you've done all the missions you have it. You can miss a legendary gun by going with the settlers rather than the raiders, but you can only get it ever by going raider. Otherwise, you can max out rep later for access to all their plans
---
Well, it looks nice with the whole set of SS camo armor, so I would buy it anyway again when they'll fix it. But for that moment, it's useless.
---
Fasnacht sausage does this too, lol. It's a great way to trigger Revenant if you have Lifesaving or Mysterious Savior.
---
God I need that salad recipe
---
can't trade atom shop skinned items
---
I really hope they bring back the working water mill...It left the shop just (like two days) before I had the Atoms to buy it.
---
logged on to check, yes
---
Yeah, I had like 2000 ult. 45 for my B2525 and I used 1500 in both fights, I use my JE handmade for everyday as I have alot more 5.56
---
Their*
---
Not a flex post, I couldn't care one way or the other what random people on the Internet think.
---
I just expect a bit of common sense from people
---
And most if the time the trade requests are from other high level players.
---
Most of the requests are from other high levels. I don't judge others by their level. My only reason for mentioning my level was to give an idea of why they shouldn't think to pull one over on me.
---
.30-06
---
I have a Tenderizer and 2 of the mods from previous Meat Weeks. I was hoping to get the plan so I could scrap the tenderizer  have. It takes hp too much inventory weight. But I cant complain. I got most of what I wanted, The Grill the full Chally outfit w/mask and the backpack. Why do I have this feeling that I would hate to have to buy  the Clean outfit or Blue grill off the  Atom shop? Like when you were a kid and  your dad said  "You'll only appreciate it if you earn it" .
---
What if you were able to get it for doing a quest for a farmer who just settled here when everyone came back. He could ask you to help him build the farming pa suit and in return you get the plans to make your own.
---
It's easy to miss the notification plus the event is usually over in ~3 mins if people are playing drums and turning the spit during the countdown. It's easy to miss it entirely, but I have to say it does pop up every hour that I've been on for it. You could set an alarm on your phone for the top of the hour to make sure you remember.
---
Welcome to being a prick at a queen event that’s not new
---
Hadn’t thought about the lunch box boosts. I usually get good enough xp from food/rested but was definitely getting double SCORE.
---
Only like 300 something caps
---
I find it hard to believe that they would have just made damage effects additive and not every effect. I guess we'll see.
---
Make sure you get the chinese stealth armor from the settlers. If you dont you'll have to pay about 5000 gold like me.
---
Yeh I'm starting to think that now lol, my bad. Guess wishful thinking got the better of me... Oh well. Onwards and up.
---
found this out yesterday. i was dropping food from meat week and saw i had 9 tato salads so i downed them all and dropped dead. my friend and i thought it was hilarious. 10/10 would eat again.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
If people wouldn’t shoot her in the air, she lands pretty quick and more frequently.
---
Dude! That's epic.
---
Totally trying that when I unlock jetpacks, lol.
---
Any chance this offer is still good? I'd need help getting over this bug. It would be much appreciated ^^.
---
Sophia kills with Snark Damage.
---
I know that yeah, but are you able to change the skin? Thanks!
---
No, I didn’t. 
---
You’re the one that has control. 
---
Having set reset times is more problematical than a floating one.
---
I don't know why they dropped 7.62 and .45-70 between 4 and 76.
---
OK, so I'm not missing anything going with one side? Awesome.
---
I want a speaker system for my camp and that weird bass riff bug everytime I get a notification again.
---
Aha, how does one get Chinese sneaky armour without 5,000 gold?
---
Most ppl prob believe if you have legacies that you have duped them to high heaven so why wouldn’t you trade them. And even if they don’t think that maybe they just try because what’s the harm in asking for it. Maybe one day somebody will not want the one they have and end up trading it. Won’t know if you don’t try. But trading sucks on this game always has and always will
---
Bruh, it's all duped lol. All of these items dropped legitimately only a tiny fraction of times.
---
Hate in dupers all ya want but they sure have helped make god rolls more accessible to everyone.
---
Probably, but you must remember one thing  - when she lands, players with high damage output can kill her in few seconds which results that the rest of players won't get loot. If you shoot her enough while she's in the air there is a higher chance you'll be able to damage her enough to get loot from her and event.
---
Now I wish I was your friend haha!
---
I don't know what treasury notes are, but I'm sure I'll find them useful, heh. I'll have to check a wiki for what gold gets me, aye.
---
Unfortunately it takes more than 30 days to max out your reputation with both factions. It's a Grind with a capital G.  Always decline the rewards to give yourself an extra 25 points a day.  After you finish the Vault raid, do Davenport's Missions at the overseers house. Turn the intelligence into the opposite faction. Also you can sell queen mirelurk  meat everyday for an extra 70 Raider karma over at Ohio river adventures.  The karma it takes to go from the beginning to Friendly is less than half of what it takes to go from friendly to Ally.
---
I will find them absolutely everywhere and know where all the easy spawns are...right up until it's a daily and suddenly I forget all but one or two spots and those will always be empty.
---
I think its through a quest through daniel, you know the settler house in the forest region (Big yellow house. With a plane outside). It totally missed me so now its stuck behind a damn pay wall.
---
Haha idiot sucks to be you!
---
Just kidding, you and everyone else will be fine.  Builds are flexible, it's just the players that aren't.  Bloody bois will either have to accept they their build actually has some risk or adapt.  I mean, irradiating 95% of your health away SHOULD add some risk.  But with stealth as it is you just become an untouchable god that sneezes in the enemy's general direction to remove them from existence.  Low hp as a strategy to gain every superpower is dumb and it's good thing that, in a few instances, it isn't the single best strategy.
---
Grahm is a rolling stone, there's no way he would stay in one place for long.
---
Thanks for the spell check. I can’t always rely on Reddit for that. I can also rely on people flexing and then using the most ironic statement of “i don’t judge people for level,” while at the same time expecting certain behaviors based on level. And at the same time expecting someone else to behave in a certain way because of your level
---
You want a common sense in a video game. 
---
You in fact do care what other people do and think otherwise a shit trade wouldn’t have prompted you to come here, and also wouldn’t have prompted you to reply to every person. 
---
None the less. I hope all your future trades go perfectly. Because the customer is always wrong
---
Cool. It sounds like everything can be attainable at some point regardless of how I get there. Cheers!
---
GREAT suggestion!
---
I was so excited when I finally got that stupid machine to give me one.  Then so heartbroken when I found out about a week later there is a static spawn of one on top of Wes-Tek
---
I appreciate the deep thoughts youngling.  Enjoy that bloodied build and the armor &amp; legacy weapon you bought off ebay.  You don't want negativity in the forums have something constructive to say about how you did it rather than another post pointing out how you're better.  The passive aggressive bullshit from your generation is hilarious.  See you in the wasteland kid.
---
It was supposed to be out last Thursday but they said they woukd put it off due to bugs  And of course there is bugs.
---
Hear me out.....*flying* deathclaws.
---
Some people are just miserable wastes....don't worry about it...
---
your right
---
I meant just plain SS, but my fingers typed F for Faster, not Furious.
---
Until they fix their terrible coding, can you really blame people for the exploiting?
---
I had two events completely fail and one complete at 50%, the lowest tier, yesterday. And all three of those they were six to eight people. I would get on the drums, another person or two would get on the drums. Then the event would start and everybody would just run around trying to kill Critters. Nobody picked up the decaying stuff, nobody grabbed the greens, just a bunch of idiots running around trying to kill the same animals. I jumped off the drums so I can do the cleanup, grab greens, drop off some wood, drop off my prime meat, turn the greens in, and then get back on drums.  Everyone else the entire time just killed Critters.
---
I mean I get jumping off the drums to turn in your prime meat and stuff but there's already six people killing Critters there's no reason for more.  Maybe the splash screen that shows when you're going to the event that tells you what you're supposed to be doing should show up in the top right corner. So like since there's 15 greens or whatever it should say 9 of 15 turned in. For the decaying stuff it should say 6 of 15 cleaned up. Maybe then people would actually do it.
---
30 days doesn't sound bad for an MMO. Especially when the quests are doable in 5 minutes, tops.
---
Davenport has the photo quest, I think, so I'm already on them. Cheers!
---
can change torso, can't change jetpack skin
---
Treasury Notes are simply exchanged for more Gold Bullion, which is the currency used to buy some high-end, exclusive Plans, that aren't available until after the Raid.
---
You spelled it correctly. I corrected your grammar.
---
I reply to people because it's polite, they were nice enough to have a talk with me. It's rude to ignore folk.
---
And yeah the customer is almost always wrong 
---
Thank you, I hope your future endeavours also treat you well
---
*July 2021
---
Tenderizer? No.
---
Oof. I shall have a look for it tonight.
---
i could say that it is hard to improve on perfection... but there are a few tweaks i'd have like to see for the gatling gun.  namely would have liked more sight options and some ammo changes.
---
i feel the melee weapons is where they REALLY missed the boat on mods.
---
like... a baseball bat you can strap junk to.  i want a gnomestick soooooo bad lol.
---
https://youtu.be/Hb8FDlaET88?t=88
---
Happy Cake Day
---
I have this issue even during regular trades. No, I'm not going to give you my other high end plans for next to nothing.
---
Epstein confirmed!
---
I scrapped mine and didn't learn shit. 10/10 would scrap that heavy piece of trash again.
---
make an alt store them
---
Version 1.41, 70 gigs left, "99+ hours" to go FML dude 😩
---
This type of shit shouldn't happen.
---
Nope. The mods are all plan only
---
I too am recently returning looking to do Encryptid. After my first/last failed attempt where none of the level 100 to 300s didn’t take any pylons I finally purchased and made a new card. Just signed up for the Discord but if you ever need another player I’m on PC as YarsPraxis. I’d love to put a nail in this quest’s coffin
---
Heck, even Vertibirbs like in Fallout 4 would be neat.
---
Lmao thanks for the heads up
---
IIRC, I got it as a standalone item
---
Lost Home and NIRA almost always have at least one.
---
If everything reset at 8pm EST, then in Europe the reset would occur very late at night when most people are sleeping.
---
After getting thru the biometric data part and you start going down the hallway there is a door on the left that says storage above and it has a picklock level of 3. If you pick it and walk thru it you will be taken all the way to the part where you must replace the mainframe cores to get to launch prep and this will help cut down time by a lot. Me my friend can solo the silo in around 5-10 min thanks to this and you wont get in trouble since bethesda purposely put it there.
---
Damn, thanks!
---
Right back at you. Here is a quick guide to Max your reps.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zTLDp5d4hNtsWkZnUKw8Ek-EYogqbaJ7UdAc7i5kIuw/htmlview#
---
I've been grabbing everything on my main, to see what I really want for my alt(s). I plan on trying different builds: my main is something of a generalist with a full-health Sneak/Sniper/Commando focus (if that's the right term, lol); my alt is going full Order of Mysteries just to play with a pistol/sword (with a little shotgun) style. Still sneaky, of course. 
---
I intend to build a third character as a PA/Heavy Tank build.
---
Launched my first as well yesterday .. that silo quest was just annoying though, mostly due to buggy / false objective highlighting (like that "destroy the mainframe" one) . Assaultrons were OK {one shotgun shot to the legs and crippled ;) }  but those f\*\*\* Turrets.
---
I hate when someone leaves after I max them out. I mean... caps are worthless anyway.
---
Yea it seem so. Can't even imagine which items could be possible in a bundle with it. So I have still to check everyday the sales lol
---
Are you using the camp module skin?
---
I second this glitch. Had it happen yesterday. Had to quit and restart
---
I launch Ed me first and only nuke about a week before wastelanders, it was hell
---
Another note. Just after the final quest keep all the gold for yourself. You may lose a couple days worth of reputation with whatever faction but that gold is way better in your pocket
---
You heard of sharing?  I dont do it so one person can go and then rip everyone else off. Also thanks everyone for the downvotes. Sad muppets.
---
Since most patches come out on Tuesday itll either come tomorrow or get pushed again, wont hear about it til Thursday. If we do hear about it at all.
---
That particular spot is great for bobbleheads, magazines, and plans. Every single time I go, I usually find at least 2 of the items I just mentioned.  Someone did a walk through post on here a few weeks back on that location.
---
Also, since I equipped that bobblehead perk, I've found more than I had in the previous 10 months of playing.
---
The camp won't show up if someone has theirs in the same spot which depending on where you put it can happen ALOT but next time you put down your camp you will have a blueprint of the entire thing you can place
---
I’m not angry. I was asking if other people found the challenge tedious and for tips. Maybe you’re projecting too much
---
"Are the multiple power connectors there on the ground to make the subsequent paths "longer" and determine order? Or is it order-placed?"
---
Yes, that's exactly it. If you only have 1 power available but have two objects that require 1 power each available to consume power then it will go:
---
1. To the one in the closest layer
---
2. If they're both in the same layer, whichever one was connected first
---
So in a lot of my builds you'll see I've placed several conduits side-by-side so that power fails over to specific objects in a way that I can control.
---
Note: There is a bug where power can leap from one circuit to another if two conduits (or anything that transmits power in a radius) have a light in their shared radius. The only way to avoid this is either to use the piped conduits or to always make sure power is always being consumed in some way. If you notice "extra" power in your circuit and you have a separate circuit it may be doing this.
---
I think a possible concern is OP is trying to do something helpful for the community and sell things at a low price to hopefully help out new players. Then comes along a high level player who doesn't care, buys out all of OP's stock and then ruins it for the new players who never even got a chance.
---
Have you switched your CAMP unit to the skin that was a reward from the Legendary Run? If so, that skin is bugged. To fix it, you have to remove the skin and, IIRC unfortunately also move/redo your camp.
---
There are 3-4 spawns in/on top of the big building near mining shaft elaine, south of Mount Blair. Its my go to place. I forgot the Name though. 😂 I always find at least one there
---
This is one of the reasons NW needs a last man standing mode that you can play. (No Teams).
---
The reason it takes so long is 1, the game has to find an avalbile server in your region and 2, it has to ensure it has enough space for you and your team if you have one.
---
I think I need Peppered then I'll have all the things from the event. All but the plans for  Shishkebab and  Flamer plans which I can buy irrc.
---
Weird. Is your game still playable? How have you tried to remedy this? 
---
I know my PS4 pro is probably not the healthiest. It's suffered lots of abrupt power outages, so I imagine that could cause corruption issues. But what do you do? 🤷
---
They would probaly make it shoot 5.56 in the game so they dont have to add another ammo to the game. Just like the handmade shoots 5.56 instead of 7.62 or how the lever action shares 45 rounds with the machine gun instead of there being 45-70 govt. Also i feel like the 45-70 is more power in shorter distances than the 7.62 and ofcourse not as accurate, but someone who actually knows ballistics please correct me would love to know the answer!
---
If you don't ask, you don't receive.
---
This is an excellent idea. Thank you.
---
Sure that can happen. I go to a lot of those queens and can still get my damage in without shooting her in the air.  Melee has to run close to start hitting her.  Most of the people I see shooting her in the air constantly shoot her and don’t stop at any point.
---
Yea, not too much Wavy Willards stuff, except perhaps the backpack from the mole miner pail event?
---
Yeah I have been pretty lucky. Hasn't crashed but has failed to start. Would be nice if people would not post their tents so close as I feel that messes him up.
---
I can get it to start up eventually and get to play but I can’t even sometiems cuz the lag is so bad. I did all the things you said in post. It seemed to help a lil but it still happens.
---
I got majority of the bobbleheads from a persons camp who was selling them for 50 caps each. Now im just lacking 3.
---
Hunting rifle is useless but my bloodied explosive lever action is sitting at 752 damage and one shots most enemies with a decent rate of fire. Obviously gets outclassed by some other guns but still fun to use and decent
---
Awesome spreadsheet! Good sir, you're a gentleman and a scholar!
---
I'm looking at about 35 days, just doing the basic quests and photo op each day, and that's ignoring the rep from the main quest. That's alright.
---
Families that nuke together stay together.
---
Yeah it doesnt bother me considering I mostly sell plans and 98% are usually under 15 caps.
---
I will my launching my first solo nuke this week! Seeing posts like this get me hyped up. Congrats on the launch!
---
I haven’t even attempted this yet. Joining the BoS was my goal. Now I’ve done that and I’m looking for uniforms and power armor that I’m too low level to wear lol
---
It's almost like they were meant for slow mo VATS
---
I expect people can use their bloody weapons just fine, as long as they wear enemy-specific armors.  If it's all super muties, put your mutant slayer armor on and be 75% tankier.  With that, serendipity, and ricochet, and you're not going to be taking any damage.  Only problem is if people can find the stash space for a few extra sets of armor...
---
Its not just during this broken event. Setting aside for the moment that Bethesda is so monumentally stupid as to allow the phenomenally buggy burrowing mobs to spawn as part of an short, *timed* event, stealth seems to be yet another thing that they somehow managed to break at some point in the last couple of weeks.
---
So many times over the last week or two you will just suddenly be DANGERed out of the blue. As a low-life char, who has for the last couple of months had exactly zero problems living in the 8-15% hp range, these sudden DANGER, literally out of fucking nowhere usually equate to death.
---
Safe. Safe. Safe. Perfectly hidden. Safe. DANGER. Boom. Dead. No warning. No shrinking caution indicator, just straight to danger and attracting the fire of everything in the area.
---
Its been happening so much of late that its been the final straw that caused me to unsub from 1st. Time to stop reinforcing failure.
---
OP's suggestion provides more flexibility. Having weekly resets means you might only login once that week but you have the ability to hit the weekly limits during that one play session. Currently with the daily limits if you only get a chance to login once in a week you can hit the daily limits for that day and you lose out on everything else.
---
Also, if you do the math OP suggested a higher weekly cap limit (10k vs. the current 9.8k based on daily limits of 1.4k) and comparable scrip and bullion limits to the current rates.
---
Agreed. Hopefully it’s available to explore outside of NW in the future. I’m hopeful for changes given how they added a no-build zone in front of the vault.
---
Yeah I notice people don't put out the fires either. As soon as the event starts I try to clean up the decaying stuff as well. Then grab greens and then shoot the critters when I can. One time it was just me and another guy doing it and all these high level people 200 and 300 where just AFK. Luckily I had 21 critter pieces and turned them in close to the end to finish the event.
---
It happens when the server lags. Hop servers.
---
I seen it yesterday on ps4 but dude dropped it near cookout time, no one showed up.  I really want to do it.
---
Player vertibots are killable because the are associated with workshops where pvp is enabled. If the make it unkillable it would need to also be unable to attack players.
---
I hate to agree.but a few months back the only way to get a be plasma was real time money.so kinda a blessing
---
A lot of those places are farmed by everyone, we all need lead unfortunately. A good idea would be to place your camp at a lead deposit if possible, if not, my brother farms Grafton whenever he logs in, kill the super mutants, take everything, scrap everything. So far its worked out well
---
I fully agree. This sucks.
---
And people will do it until BGS won't fix "magic" weapons and exploited guns that kills her in couple of seconds. On PTS still you can see both in action...
---
It’s more difficult than it looks. Be sure to have two pieces of fall damage reduced armor on as you can die midair.
---
Yea I guess that and the plushi are the only items. I would love to have a wallpaper of wavy Willards, a croco lamp and maybe some kind off wall deco like a croco on a surf board. And as big item like the glass dome or shady sheed I would love to have a door entrance that's looks like a big croco mouth. That's a bundle I would by lol
---
Is it?? Finally some good news, hell yes.
---
Maybe it has something to do with health? Defaults to the target with the lowest health and the rad toad eggs have so little health it always makes them the first target?
---
Just missing the spicy and salted mod.  Have multiples of the peppered but those 2 just seem to not want to drop
---
Also on PS4. This happened to me with one of my friends. Both been playing since Beta, now, he just stopped showing up in my list, I’m still in his though. Been that way for over a month now. I’ve tried everything the Internet has suggested, with no luck. Only thing left to do is uninstall and reinstall the game. I’ve heard that should fix it, but I’ll lose all my load screen images.
---
Rumor has it there may be a fix for this on the PTS, and may role out soon.
---
I request you have been insulted
---
They do appear at every level, but they're often in demand. If another player gets them before you, they can take a while to re-spawn. I never use guns myself, but I do know 5.56 ammo is always the fastest selling ammo on my vendors. 
---
You may have to leave the world, wait a minute, then rejoin to hop to a new server to find one that hasn't been plundered for lead.
---
Handy guide on ammo crafting 12k of ammo in 30 mins here, that may have some useful locations for you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5GyD301h60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5GyD301h60)
---
Surprised I havent seen this commented yet, but some people just buy their weapons with real money, like from ebay. Not saying it's right or wrong, but there's definitely a market for it out there.
---
Most people will wait till the event is over before they sell their plans.  Theyre worth more if they are no longer available
---
I'm in a similar boat re lead,
---
I added lead to the highlight in the world option (go into component list and there should be an option to highlight resources in the world) then grab any cans, caffateria trays and everything else with a magnifying glass on it :) 
---
When you get to a higher level theres a perk called ammosmith that will let you craft an extra 40% ammo.
---
Somewhere on this r/ yeah
---
I had been trying to complete that daily for about 2 hours at the point of posting and was my last challenge to complete. Don’t know why you’re trying to speculate on the nature of humans in 2020, on a post about fallout 76.
---
It spawns when you fire the flare for the helipad event at the airport, but its neutral and will fly off after a while.
---
Unless you shoot her.
---
I support this.  If they can't manage it, or there are too many reasons not to do this, at least put a countdown in my pipboy to tell me when the legendary scrip machine or the treasury notes, etc. reset.  I can't be expected to manage my time and remember what I did the day before (that is not sarcasm, I really cant' remember shit).
---
Huge tip-thanks a ton
---
There will always be workarounds...
---
Thanks. That should help.
---
I found all my power armor over time.  Explore enough areas and pick up power armor pieces as you go, then just put pieces on a chassis.  That's how I got a full Raider, T-45, T-51 and T-60.
---
How's the gauss mini? Last i heard it's ballistic even though ammo is under energy
---
Don't think it does. I have seen people that own it but you know how they get when you try test it. They just back out the server which I can't blame them.
---
People are doing 3200 damage per shot with a pipe revolver dude, I mean the damage output peak is rediculous lol
---
It won't be that much of a nerf unless you have a min maxed build like that
---
Watched that vid a few times yesterday trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Seems that lead is just crazy to come by.
---
Have you managed to get the ammo converter from the legendary run yet? That might help you a bit, too.
---
While I can understand wanting it to last longer usually I prefer just to get it over with. The first couple of times it was fun to experience it. Now I just want to farm it to get the loot. I pretty much have it all but one Tenderizer mod plan.
---
Do you only need the torso to get the extra ores?
---
I am using the camp module skin. 
---
It was working fine until just recently, but I I guess I’ll have to redo the camp again. Uugh.
---
Thanks guys.
---
Yes! Dont forget to bring her a towel.
---
1. They are not in game yet, only out on pts
---
2. You get them threw scrapping normal perk cards for perk coins, you get the first rank for free
---
Stealth is also effected by your armor's weight, a full set of shadowed unyelding leather would be the best if you truly never plan on getting shot.
---
I did the job
---
Its worth playing through as a fallout game. But yes its buggy. And its actually been getting buggier of late. The incompetence of the small maintenance team that is running it must be experienced to be truly believed. So while i do recommend the game to any fallout junkies who want to play through its story content, i absolutely do not recommend it to anyone looking for a decent online survival combat game.
---
It definitely does not benefit everyone.  It clearly only benefits casual players who aren't able to maximize the GB, caps, scrip, etc. because they have a life/spouse/kids/work/excuses.  The people who play everyday would most likely max everything out the first day then have to wait all week to do anything else.  While it amounts to the same overall, it would just plain suck having to wait that long to do it all over again.  A daily time gate is bad enough; a weekly one would likely ruin the experience for many players and drive people away in the end.
---
Trading
---
May have to give this a try when I get my level up a bit more. I just got to Grafton yesterday and the bots and super mutants were level 40's and 60's.
---
Shit hit registration
---
Nope still a steaming pile of garbage the people are ok just it's buggy shits still not fixed and Bethesda hates you don't play it put you're time into something else
---
I enjoy it. 1.2k hours and still like the game. If you'll like it is something you have decide. I would recommend giving it another go though
---
I wouldn't know, I am on XBox.
---
Kazatjok
---
Didn't even know about that. I saw the legendary run on the menu but didn't have a clue what it was. Thanks.
---
Bang the drums or spin the meat wheel, just gotta get the job done
---
Except there's many parts of WV that are still highly irradiated because government dumped a bunch of toxic barrels, and what i suggest is a counter to the scorchbeasts, not just a new enemy type, the sheepsquatch and colossus rarely, if ever have encountered a scorchbeast
---
Scorchbeast queen contemplating has her reign truly ended.

CSA?
---
Or yeet a mini Nuke or two lol
---
Yes, curious?
---
Being able to stalk through crater and foundation and kill every single voiced npc inside them would add many hours of enjoyment to the game.
---
Was told a cool and brilliant trick to help with this. Use your camera. It'll show the label when you are looking at them even if you can't see them. 
---
Of course if you blew them into tiny pieces ..... maybe use a different gun.
---
To add they are more like talents than cards. Your entire account shares them. You sacrifice perk cards to level legendary ones up.
---
Have they? That is really promising then!
---
You get the plans for the suit during one of the settlers prep quests to raid the vault.
---
Find yourself a fancy shotgun, anti-armor magic shotguns are the way to go.  Or a combat shotgun with a perforating magazine.
---
Your account shares the slots, not the cards
---
As you use the power core it generates fertilizer too.
---
True , i got about 10 magic shotguns stashed just in case
---
It's a 2-3 month event, with daily SCORE challenges that advance you on the board. This season ends 8th of September, so you'd get to rank 20-30'ish at best if you started now. HOWEVER, the ammo converter is only about rank 5? You can get it in a day or two.
---
Unless the US implemented a serf system and had developers like Garrahan who wanted to fight back against the automation of the nation's farmers.
---
Except that poeple are mostly stupid so of course many of them will just stand there afk not doing drums OR spits.
---
No idea...
---
You can fire without vats, ya know
---
hey if you still need one ill be on after work today just shoot me an xbox message
---
I have min-maxed builds for all my 3 characters (PA bloodied heavy gunner, bloodied stealth commando and bloodied unarmed) and I was able to do much higher damage with stealth, which is irrelevant in this discussion. I play to have fun, to feel like-semi god, I was collecting best gear from premiere to be able kill everything in the game solo without struggling. Not to fight 20 minutes with bullet-sponges. If you like changes - good, I don't like them and will be upset if they'll go live in current state.
---
Ya i wish there wasn't a limit on legendary turn ins. Im sitting on a bunch of 3 star junk legendaries just waiting for the daily reset... just to do it all over the next day. They said from the beginning they want you to have to choose what to keep. Problem is they also put in the script vendor so you want to keep everything for that. I have probably 1200 treasury notes I can't spend because I'm waiting on reset each day. Hopefully they ease up on the restrictions.  At least make it better as a catchup mechanic for everyone starting late in games cycle.
---
It might encourage healthier play habits.
---
Heh, Aquaboy/girl has been helpful to me a few times during shopping trips...
---
I don't try to speculate...
---
Each time a challenge requires more than 5mn to be done, someone whines about it on reddit: things are how they are. People gets frustrated very easily. I am sorry if you feel concerned.  
---
But if you ask me, frustrating is not a good word.   
---
Those challenges are just lazy and uncreative. This is more my concern .
---
"good", as in quality? ehhh...
---
"good", as in fun? i always thought it was, but thats more of a matter of personal taste.
---
Yeah someone wrote here that it is fixed in pts and uses SS linings.
---
A few times this weekend I made it to the last spawn of prime enemies and they never show up so the event times out.  When they do you have to chase them down and the timer runs out.  I get a thumbs down for getting on a drum or spit which I had been on from before the actual timer starts.  I am done with this event, I have everything collectable except for the Chali Moo Moo head so I will buy it later from someone.
---
Im moving on as well. In the 470 hours of logged in the past 4-5 months, every single patch has made the game worse. And the trend only seems to be accelerating with the upcoming nerf to player damage and buff to enemy hp. The game is already becoming bad enough, i dont need killing things to be tedious on top of everything else.
---
They made some note in the PTS that it is for some future content, just don’t know what that is!
---
The community assumption is tomorrow at update
---
One would describe the experience, the other the overall design. Don’t see why both couldn’t be the case. Also still searching-i’m way past your five minute mark
---
That makes more sense.
---
So I believe the algorithm determines which target you most want to select, and then makes that the most difficult target to get to, regardless of which direction you go in. Some very advanced stuff
---
It was posted in the Bethesda forums that it would be delayed until the beginning of this week last Thursday or Friday. I'm not aware of any other communication. I expect it will be Tuesday at the absolute earliest.
---
Y’all stop downvoting people for sharing not harmful opinions
---
Thats kind of you but Im just gonna see if I get it myself. Theres still time this round and if it doesnt happen there will be another round coming. Plus theres always a chance a friend will get a spare I can swap for something they need.
---
I'm sure those drums compliment my rotating spit.  I'd more positive if I was actually there at the time
---
According to the forums it is today at 10 est
---
I’ve started gettin a bug where I fast travel and I’ll see the loading screen. It’ll make the noise like you loaded in but the loading screen image will change and just sit there. I waited long enough once I could here the lack of water noise while still seeing the loading screen.
---
U/snippysnoppety u up to give it away?
---
The slots are shared with all your characters but they each need to lvl them up individually. Once you unlock a slot you can freely assign a card on that slot,but after that,every swap requires 1 perk coin.
---
You'll basically have your main with levelled cards and your alts with 6 lvl 1 cards,unless you're mad enough to start level them up on each character,which would take you years to say the least.
---
They don't care how much you play everyday, they just care that you play EVERY DAY. The daily limits are to keep you coming back. It's a strategy as old as MMO's. 
---
I am genuinely shocked that so many people don't get this.
---
hah, certainly!
---
I think eventually you just learn to live with it.  After all this time I just don't pick up most legendary items that drop once I have reached my scrip limit for the day unless they are lightweight or actually good drops.  
---
I've been grinding levels on my main lately but I have 4 alts all able to scrip at max level so what I would do a lot is just switch characters when I reach my limits for the day.  Then I would just play that character til I reached the limits and move on the next one and so on.  
---
They could raise the scrip limits but then we would just end up with more stuff from the purveyor that we don't have room for and then we would want more stash space and where does it end?
---
Maybe increasing the scrip limit for the day to 200 or 250 would help but I think we would still have the same issues.  Time will tell if that is something they want to do.
---
I love it, i almost never get bored
---
Yeh, I certainly would have picked the cosmo jetpack if I could! but it doesn't look bad, just a bit bulky. Makes sense for the excavator.
---
good grief. I picked up a mask for 10 caps at a vendor tonight for the spare outfit i have. I dont know if Im lucky or what
---
The point of the limitations is blatantly obvious.  Of course they would rather you play for 2 hours everyday for a year rather than blowing through the entire game in a couple weeks and moving on to something else.  If you're on every day, you'll have a chance to look at the atomic shop every day and possibly make a purchase, every day.  "Need more storage because you can't do anything with the legendaries you have because of the daily scrip limits?  Buy Fallout 1st! :D"  It's all by design.  They may be stupid but they're no dummies.
---
The only bundle I remember was a plushy bundle,otherwise it has always beem sold separately.
---
People like you are the reason I read carefully
---
As a heavy PA build I still crouch from time to time. If you can score a 850+ headshot per bullet in sneak why would you stand out of it? It's free.
---
Where from ? And if you manage to find another I’d pay
---
Yeah me and my 43 Asylum worker's white hats would love to know too.
---
Sauce?
---
Don't ever take Todd Rundgren for advantage.
---
&gt; It definitely does not benefit everyone. It clearly only benefits casual player
---
I'm not in the slightest way a casual player.  This is a huge quality of life improvement.  
---
Even as simple as - you really enjoy trying to add up your scrip sales to exactly 150?  I find it a pain.  I'd much rather be able to scrip stuff as I get it during the week - until I hit that cap.  
---
Likewise, I have 300 treasury notes.  Moving the slider to hit 20 every day is a pain.  Let me do it once a week.
---
It does - the helmet comes with all of the standard mods, including the "Internal Database" one which adds +1 Intelligence
---
Depends on the person really.  I don’t like exposing effect to much so for something lime a handmade I prefer 25/25.
---
Yeah, haven't sprung for it but its my next purchase. I've said my season atoms for it. Almost required.
---
My lifesaver!
---
Originally a comment on anothers post, figured it should have its own post.
---
The usual time ?
---
U don’t need 5 ranks.  1-2 tops is all u need.
---
Same for me.  Finally decided to launch my own nuke since everyone was doing meat week.  4-5 lvl 100+ and barely any damage.  Seems inconsistent.  Saw her land and get lit up with melee and big gun damage and barely a dent.  Other times, she goes in seconds.
---
Yes. But not the usual day.
---
Seconding dropping the lockpick unless you're actually picking a lock.  I'd add 3\* Master Rifleman.  If you're in a nuke zone, it might be useful to have one of your 3\* cards available in 2\* as well so you can run with Green Thumb and double your raw flux collecting.
---
I'd heard they were going to open up the vault from the raids for exploration so I really hope it goes well and they end up doing the same for all of the vaults. Vault lore is one of my favourite things about the universe.
---
It's gotta Hawaiian sound,  I dig it!
---
Get back on your stage &lt;flips safety hatch on fnaf shock pad&gt; NOW -._-.
---
Should be pretty handy!
---
Valseek's post on the forum.
---
Can I ask what is so special about the tato salad recipe? I see lots of people wanting it. I did get it but the tato salad doesnt really give anything special. Is it just because its rare and for the completion factor or is there something Im missing?
---
Holy shit. I thought my stealth was broken because I just changed builds.
---
Unfortunately they seem intent on time-gating everything. I try to spend my caps very freely, buying ammo from players and serum recipes so that I can sell legendary items in my vendor and get value from them when I can't scrip any more. Crappy one star items get sold to train station vendors at times. If all else fails, I will transfer stuff to a second character to store or scrip.
---
That's one sexy bat.
---
I love this plan.
---
With consoles yes
---
Its today
---
Yup, I just found it, thanks.  That's awesome!
---
Only thing better is if it played the cymbals too...
---
Nope.  I've tried to engage it and it won't.  Same with the one that sometimes flies over near Flatwoods post-Wastelanders.
---
Yes...yes I can. 
---
They don't have to break it...it's their choice to use exploits and try to break things.
---
Are the servers going offline for it?
---
Yep. Happens in Uranium Fever a lot: some dude shows up with a melty god weapon and just starts blasting. When that happens, I'll roll out into the hallway and wait for the event to complete. I'm already only there for the treasury notes, so you fuck up the loot and you can do it yourself.
---
Yes.
---
I haven’t played much after the release. The vault was filled with people, there was a fight at that one meat factory every 10 minutes, and supplies seemed more common, but that might’ve been because I was with a friend
---
There’s definitely something wrong with energy damage values on the PTS. They’re not consistent with the other reductions and I can’t imagine that they’re performing as intended. 
---
While I think the changes to ballistic weapons are probably about where they’re going to end up, there are obvious changes still to be made. Bethesda acknowledged that Unarmed wasn’t performing properly and said it will be addressed. I’m sure there will be other changes as well, energy weapons likely being another. 
---
The community asked for a test server for months, we finally got one and here we go freaking out about things in the testing phase. Everybody needs to remember that these changes are in testing. Some things are going to work, some things are going to break. Many things will get changed. Don’t do anything drastic with your build or your gear until we get closer to a final product, we’re clearly not there yet.
---
What does your ammo have to do with glass or cloth? These resources are readily available, much more so than concrete.
---
It means the event completion bar is filling up.
---
Thanks for the heads up. 👍
---
Take a shot in the dark but I figured there would be a 1 week buffer maybe. They have been testing patch 22 for a while so it would be nice to see one season end and get another right away.
---
It's bumping up the progress bar of the event
---
It's pinging because you're increasing the progress bar as you drum, even when the event is counting down to begin.
---
Want a video of me using it on a wall with neon letters spelling out my name?
---
Fair enough, what gun am I thinking of then?
---
It means you're adding to the BBQ event completion count. TIP: get on the drums or turn meat while the "waiting on event to start" timer is going. It actually counts. If you have 6 people doing that (3 drums 3 meat turners) the bar starts at almost 90% complete right off the bat.
---
My simple solution is never open a trade window with anybody for any reason. The way it's set up now is absolutely terrible and I refuse to use it. Until they make some kind of trading system were it's not just for caps I will not participate in trading.
---
 It's a shame too because I have a stash full of Great, Godly and legacy weapons.  Until the trade window is fixed (most likely never with this company)they will stay in my stash Box collecting dust.
---
Happened twice for me that I remember over the weekend.
---
Cloth makes gun powder I believe.
---
Damnit. Is the part where I get to blame Bethesda for not getting my personal approval on their schedule? Lol
---
See you Friday night Earle!!
---
Are all the SBs immune, or just the SBQ?
---
Those aren’t bad at all honestly.
---
Oh true. I haven't made gun powder in ages. Totally forgot about that
---
I’m getting new lights installed in my game room. No playing for me until that’s finished.
---
Just because your strength is already maxed doesn't mean you can't pick another strength card when you level up, you could put a point in luck and pick up expert slugger for example, you don't need to rely on perk pack cards to get it.
---
I think you’re talking about the best way to get diseases and mutations
---
\- maybe the splash screen ....
---
if you listen to Grahms rambings, he tells you everything humans need to do to complete the event.
---
I get the impression there is no set number of each item you need to collect - rather, there is an overall target number to complete.
---
Each \~ 1-/2 turns of the meat spit is a point, each x time frame on the drum is a point, each poo/green/critter chunk/brush fire is a point... points from all are cummulative, and after X points are gained, the event is complete.
---
Neither of those things are hard to come by.
---
Cloth is needed to make gunpowder. Pterry important part of making ammo i would say.
---
That shows you're contributing to the event. Each ping is the completion bar inching toward completion.
---
Plays game so much doesn't remember the basics🤯
---
Vendor hopping helps finding good deals on weapons.  A lot of vendor hopping but u will get lucky eventually. 
---
And obviously dupers and hackers.
---
You need to remember that not everyone is on trading forums. I bought my bloodied hm 50/25 that I still use today from a walk up trade. Like I said, you don’t ask, you never will get a YES. Now when you keep asking over and over, then yes, that’s a problem
---
They are taking console 76 offline at 10 AM to implement it. [Link](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424802/update-hotfix-on-august-24-for-consoles?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en)
---
They made sure the enemies could always find you, even in stealth, but they still prefer to run away in the opposite direction.
---
Yeah. I cured one or two, then just never bothered again.
---
They just don't seem to be that big of an issue.
---
Been playing it for a month now. Not really a MMO kind of guy myself but there's lots of very 'Fallout' missions, humour, etc. The events seem alright. Only ever accidentally done a few.
---
I really like this game. Pretty much a Fallout game.
---
The stash being always full is REALLY, REALLY annoying.
---
I actually get more concrete than either of those, or just retain more because you never use it.
---
I have a feeling it’s Tuesday. Keeping the expectations really low this time lol
---
I've not been bothered by one yet, either... IDK.
---
Launched my first yesterday as well!  Not sure why I waited so long.  Figuring out the silo was a pain but think I can get through it a lot quicker next time.  Hope once meat week is over people will be back to dropping nukes so I can avoid having to run the silo by my self.
---
just wait it's going to get worse. soon the one wasteland thing will happen. all monsters will start getting harder and harder but you will not gain any more skills and abilities. none of your weapons or armor will get stronger. so you will never ever feel powerful... and on top of that people want it. o sure i want to get attacked by a level 200+ monster while im effectively level 50. with no chance of getting stronger weapons or better armor. someone thought it was a good idea to uncap the monsters but keep the player's gear capped at 50.
---
Drop your unwanted legendaries near the main train station. It might feel weird at first, but its better than lugging it around for "one day". You can also throw them in a vendor, but i usually find they dont sell for much and arent worth the hassle considering the cap on caps. I have tons of decent mid tier legendaries that I continue to save for that fateful trade, but have been slowly getting rid of as I pare down my stash space.
---
It’s not even close to the same the 25 is better easily.
---
You cant save up levels the new cards wont unlock till you use your unused pionts
---
I like the location. Scenic on a clear day!
---
This for cp event for console?
---
These goals are 10x what the project alphas goals were.
---
Whitesprings with a buddy get the first hit on the enemies and let your friend finish them
---
Yea but being 10x the previous amount is just garbage.
---
Built my camp on a junk and lead deposits. Sometimes i have too much lead.
---
Id absolutely love a cloak over it like the fallout 4 mod
---
OMG level 100 in two months? I've been playing from BETA to last November, and then from Wastelanders update to now, and only in May I've got to level 100... Now hitting 200, all because of The Legendary Run and Meat Week.
---
K
---
Every year you get a free name change
---
Right.  Lol.  All cursed weapons are mainly rolls we get all the time and would have scripted quick.
---
That’s why you jump around like a fucking moron while fighting things
---
If you want, ill be online in a couple hours. I can run you through lucky hole mine. It is well known for lead ore and plenty of drops. I can take care of the enemies, you pick up the lead. It wont last forever, but at least this way you will have somewhere to go often to get more.
---
Capture workshops, Join a Building Team for the intelligence bonus, do quests, and do events. All those combined should level you pretty quickly and get you some decent loot and exploration along the way.
---
Damn, I've played since launch and are only level 140 something.
---
Ill respond to you when Im on and we can meet up at somepoint.  I have a family member's birthday today actually so my playtime will be severely limited but ill be in touch
---
I rarely even notice I have them in the first place haha. I think it would be cool if it actually felt like a disease!
---
Yeah, I thought of this as well.  I guess the trade off is losing your junk, though.  But it would be really frustrating to insta-die during a dungeon crawl area right at the end before you pass through an exit-only door and have to go through it all again.
---
More like I'm not a noob anymore who scrounges for the basics. I spend my caps on ammo from other players to make room for more caps lol
---
Just do quests and you will level. High intellect builds get more exp. and there are bonus exp. weekends, public groups bonuses, and some aid that improves experience gains. 
---
At level 25 you should be doing the excavator power armor quest line. Excavator is a great set with bonus carry weight.
---
I’ve done all those but the building teams, so thanks for the suggestion.
---
Isn't the usual time 12PM EST?
---
I almost always under price items. Caps don’t do much besides buy garbage plans for garbage weapons and armor I don’t use, so what’s the point of putting all the effort into wringing every last cap out of something
---
No idea where you're getting that from.
---
Well you don't have to do it today it's at  your convenience just let me know when you have the time and you're comfortable and then we'll do it.
---
That’s not how One Wasteland works. The highest level enemy I’ve seen on my level 300+ character is 100. Most are 50-75. They don’t scale up inifinitely.
---
Alr thanks
---
Trading or sacrifice to the Purveyor (usually in the form of thousands of scrip). Most legendaries that drop from the world are garbage but there are gems now and then. Once in awhile you'll find a god roll for cheap on a vendor. Just keep at it, learning what affixes/prefixes are valuable and desirable helped me a lot. Always check the level before buying :)
---
No, I like the challanges this way... Much better then killing 5 ghouls in a spacesuit inside a nuke
---
Oh my god within a week?!? I can’t do this anymore I’ve grinded this game everyday for 2 hours everyday for the past 2 months
---
They made the challenges like this because players complained the old ones were too hard.
---
I'm confused are you upset that they are too difficult or because they are too easy?
---
I completed my pass weeks ago so I don't even look at the challenges anymore until at the end of my session out of curiosity and after a short play session it seems I complete almost all of them every day just by playing without even knowing what they are.  To me, that means they are well-designed if I can complete them just by playing my normal way without even knowing what they are.
---
Also for the build challenges there is no need to delete stuff at your camp.  Just take a workshop and do it there.
---
10am for patches.
---
Noon for updates to the Atom Shop.
---
People will complain either way.
---
This. Saving levels is only useful after level 50.
---

My runs were about an hour apart.  The only thing different was the server.   The first one i made sure to do right after the BBQ and I think there may have been a primal cuts going and that's why nobody showed up...at first.
---
About 10 people suddenly showed up right as she died lol.  People had 3 minutes warning it was dropping and then another 2 minutes before she died. Guess 5 scrip worth of meat and a MAYBE legendary is better than 2 guaranteed legendary drops, flux and repair kits.
---
with the game being really harder on PTS, this will be interesting.  ;)
---
Except this doesn't make me want to play more at all it makes me want to leave and find a different game that doesn't seem to hate that I play it.
---
always drops after completing the cookout until you learn the plan
---
Scorch-spreading is the new thing
---
Because Big Capitalism is what will Rebuild America, not camp flea markets. (although id adore a npc flea market...)
---
Use the terminals (Hack level 3) to turn off the turrets. Or better yet, reprogram them to attack the robots, then turn them off.
---
you misses the point:
---
 I don't say it's hard or easy I don't have issue to do the challenge, they make you play against the game.
---
They are uninteresting.
---
Even unlimited storage doesn't solve the problem. Why store the legendaries away when all they mean in my storage is that on another day in the future I get the reward of not playing at all since I already have all the rewards for the day in my stash ready to turn in.
---
Or a body marker!! I always want a corpse marker.
---
No but I gladly paid 1k for a Cursed Pickaxe to complete my own *My Blood Valentine* cosplay
---
It doesn't hate that you play it. It's indifferent that you play it.
---
Love or hate this method, it works. Otherwise the game wouldn't be here.
---
I think it's today not tomorrow.
---
Yea for concrete. It’s a different resource that is way more abundant.
---
Why tomorrow?
---
Since they apparently got rid of the warning noise you get to play the game of risk looting and exploding or wait and miss out. Kind of like fo76 russian roulette.
---
Well I think I read it wrong then and just assumed it was tomorrow. If it’s today even better
---
It said today August 24th from what Valseek posted.
---
Or just fast travel to whitespring clubhouse and drink from the fountain near it for free cure disease.
---
Oh shit my bad. Hell yeah
---
Always have spare molotovs or explosive weapon and be prepared for "Line in the sand".
---
Fort defiance is great too! High level ghouls, so do it with a friend, it has 40 cap outfits to sell to a vendor too! I often find legendaries there as well! And if the other side isn't locked you can try unlocking it and run at the end. Maybe you will find the rare asylum outfits you can trade for good equipment.
---
Find a group and do glass caverns. Usually if you offer to give away all found steel for the help, people will let you join. Just make sure to have explosive weapon and a lot of repair kits.
---
Otherwise just do quests, stay active and you'll be fine! Eat that Cranberry cake, Scortchbeast brain, meat stew from special event never expires. Use lunchboxes and keep well rested bonuses!
---
That's about it. 😊
---
FYI all of the build up camp things can be done at a workshop. No need to make any adjustments to your camp
---
Agree my friend and it really so pissing me off
---
GZ!
---
Soon to be 200 myself (197) 🙏🏼
---
That doesn't feel weird it feels like no solution at all to the fact that I don't get any reward for my gameplay after some arbitrary limit not picking up the items would be the same as picking them up to drop somewhere for lower level characters. All that would do is expedite their inevitable race to the same limits.
---
There is a single roof paint, it was in the atom store a while back. I think it's Asbestos Roof. It's nice
---
I had that happen with the meat week apparel. Cept a level 25 did it. And resold them for 9,999 caps. The whole lobby to my knowledge was just like dude why
---
Ok I’ll try that, thanks.
---
Do you have a link please? I don't know where to find the forums
---
Best luck to you!
---
Wait people don't have 80-100 antibiotics sitting in their inventory at any given time?
---
No problem 👍
---
I mean, there are mods. It takes a bit to set them up, but there aren't a whole lot of content mods. Mostly just reskins and PipBoy edits.
---
I think the idea of the melee attack one is to encourage actual teamwork/coordination. Daily Ops are meant to give you a reason to team up with other players and run through them so if you were able to sneak solo them and one shot all the mobs it would kinda defeat that purpose.
---
I agree, this season shit has ruined it for me.  I no longer can login and do what I feel like doing.  Everything I do is dictated by the season dailies and weekly.
---
I've had fun with this game but the thought has crossed my mind a LOT lately about not playing once I finish the season content.  
---
Makes me a bit sad because I've loved this game when when it's filled with stupid bugs.
---
I don't want the devs directing how I play.  They messed up too, when they made it so you have to grab rewards in order.  If you only like something from the final section, too bad, you have to have been playing it from the start.
---
Okay so I can’t do daily ops, nice 😎.
---
Dude.... the sentry bots break my heart! lmao I've had them blow themselves, every car in a 2000 mile radius and any unlooted enemy in said same radius in to feckin' space.
---
That fix doesnt work at all.
---
np
---
Id say 1k is a fair price though.
---
agreed about damage and accuracy. they are also slow as hell. they need a major buff. right now they are just a distraction for enemies
---
I went looking and found its getting released today:

---
Well, I read you post, but I haven't found even the slightest example of what is the interesting challenge in your opinion. It's easy to critic something, but that kind of criticism, without effort from your side, it's pointless rant....
---
Guess I am leaving working now...
---
Unfortunately I don't have any updates on this one yet, I'm sorry!
---
* OP: Do you want the event completion?
---
* Me: I think I'm entitled to the event completion, yes.
---
* OP: DO. YOU. WANT. THE. EVENT. COMPLETION?!
---
* Me: I WANT THE DRUMS
---
* OP: YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE DRUMS!
---
5/7; would upvote OP again.
---
i did everts, over and over and over and farmed legendaries day in and day out. started saving legendaries up until vending machines were released. and i started making alot of bank. so much so i had to make a second setup on a different machine to be my banks. then i used that funding to go to groups designed for the selling and trading of these weapons. and i purchased them. armor thanks to wastlanders. i just make myself..... i also hear a few websites sell them for real money. but thats not my cup of tea.
---
If you have First, create alts, and container/drop trade to them to scrip more on your private server.
---
Its silly they have limitations, but there are work arounds.
---
I scrip 6 toons worth every 2 or 3 days and buy legendary modules with most of it.
---
Neat. Thank you. I will save this for future reference 😇
---
Worked for me on multiple characters.
---
The fact remains that the only people who grind this game are low iq losers who play a dead game. This game shouldn't be a grind if no one plays it for that reason.
---
I did it just 2 minutes ago, exactly to a tee, and nope. Still got the same nonsense on the terminal of there being no blood sample.
---
so its just going to be 25-50 levels higher then my highest gear item. not real bad but still anoying when it one shots you i bet.
---
Or a suit that was designed for commercial farming to replace the need for seasonal workers. That’s a valid objective for someone like RobCo.
---
ok fanboy
---
I didn't donate a single unit of materials to this atlas thing, still got the rewards that I never will use, just seems a waste of time, more fun to actually playing the game.
---
Ah...
---
so now i can blame bethesda even more for not getting all of the meat week plans.
---
&gt;Third, give vertibots ability to mark any enemy it sees with a marker similar to recon scope.
---
It's Fallout 76 not Call of duty modern warfare ..palmface.
---
IMHO, you are not doing anything wrong.  
---
I have a few explosive weapons in inventory - I didn't get them until I was beyond L175 or so.  They are not my primary weapons.
---
  My primarys are two low to mid-tiers.
---
My primary is a one star vampire switchblade (looted) and secondary is a SS ghoul slayers switchblade (looted).  
---
Those two are supplanted by a vampire gatling plasma (drop from fashnacht) and a vampire 50 cal (Mrgph).  Neither are explosive.
---
With those 4, I can take out anything in the game.  With the exception of the ghoul slayers, might not one shot anything, but they are effective and do get the job done.
---
it looks like you're can't cope with criticism either...
---
Still I need to build 20 useless connectors ;)  
---
My point is: what is the point?
---
I’ll definitely remember this. Thanks!
---
I cannot imagine a world where I would pay them more money in order to work around the limitations they put in the game. Rewarding mechanics I disagree with is just not something I want to do.
---
Haha yea in hindsight it sounds crazy, but im also  exaggerating a bit. And it never really transferred, RS3 is just the evolved runescape that was before. The major engine and game overhaul that was done in 2007 (im guessing because of name, dont know the exact date) caused the game to be much more alike WoW and other action-rpgs with hotkeys etc. It caused a major loss in interest from the original fanbase, but they took the great route and relaunched the "classic" runescape experience as a brand new game with the old engine and gameplay. After a while the playerbase on OSRS overtook the playerbase on RS3 and has been like that until today. All updates and major changes to OSRS must be pass-voted by the players with at least 75% positive votes or it would be added.

It has remained with a very active community and its tons of fun. The addition of mobile crossplay from both IOS and Android caused a major playerspike in 2018.

---
&gt; Do they really just want me to only play for a couple of hours a day at most? 
---
It seems to me the metrics this company use and see as important are number of logins to the server not hours on the server.
---
I don't do trades with randoms unless they have a mic.
---
Most people have way too much stuff to look through and it takes forever. 
---
I have gotten some great stuff from doing it though.
---
25,000 x 10 is 250,000. Are you brain dead or not learn math?
---
Nut
---
Yeah man looks so good
---
Bethesda games have so many massive moving parts that adding or changing one thing screws other things. So yes, continuous updates make problems happen, and sure, if they stopped adding things a mod patch could be made, but that's a whole different kettle.
---
See, I don't mind the meat week afkers, unlike the fasnacht varient the meat week ones actually contribute to the event 
---
It doesn't matter if they are manning the drums or rotating the spits they are contributing and thus helping to complete the event, they aren't rubberbanding or standing idle whilst the rest are running around
---
Wow planned to finish a couple SCORE challenges before the reset today. Nice heads up on the maintenance.
---
Haha yeah, Graham makes him sound like a Supermutant accountant
---
The servers are going down for maintenance. I was expecting it tomorrow tbh, this is a welcome surprise
---
why?
---
It's actually much more simple: They don't put more resources in.
---
This game isn't fun I really only play anymore for the cash based market for it. I'm taken away that people are dumb enough to pay actually money for this garbage game.
---
Can't wait for posts to go from "where is the event?" to "the event sucks!"
---
I firmly believe that the reason for the massive amount of bugs in fallout 4 and fallout 76 is because they just don't know how to fix them without breaking couple other thing while in the process. There is absolutely no other reason possible for having bugs that have been around for years. The multiple times bandaid fixed and stiched 20 year old Creation Engine is so bad that even they don't know anymore how to make it work.
---
Let's go ! Got ma nukecards ready  : )
---
Shouldn't your reason to log on just be that you enjoy playing the game and if you don't enjoy it then you don't log on?
---
Hey don't get me wrong I'm all for more free stuff but this seems unlikely to happen.
---
I’m pumped
---
 [https://nukacrypt.com/devtracker](https://nukacrypt.com/devtracker)
---
Tbh I figured they would’ve delayed again. So yes it is a surprise. I took off work today on vacation so I hit update on it and will get on the grind when I get home couple hours from now
---
People are always edging to catch out traders who will put up something for trade cheap by mistake.
---
Just avoid trade in game and only buy from proven honest traders on the trade sub.
---
yes the collosul preblem is confermed
---
When has there ever been a challenge to build connectors?
---
25,000 what? Where are you getting that number from? Some citation is going to be needed here if you're going to start slinging insults.
---
Honestly I feel that camp defense need a rework, I mean how many people actually use turrets? Much less dedicate the budget to a effective defense instead of building and awesome camp. It sucks because we are getting wall/ceiling mounted turrets in the future and while I would like to use them, I feel the budget could be used for something better.
---
literally now
---
if you've rolled an unyielding chest piece then I would mark that one off the list, and move on to trying to get unyielding arms and legs, once you have a complete set maybe go  back and try to grind a better one but if you are looking for a particular piece like I would love a unyielding, AP refresh, weapon weight reduction but trying to get that exact piece is a 1 in 300,000 chance so I'm just rolling with what I've got for now
---
Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but legendary perks aren't live yet, right? Just the PTS?
---
Everything I can find online says Bethesda originally targeted 20 for it, but I don't see them in game and I can't find anything talking about them being delayed.
---
Sorry for being OOTL...
---
Servers just got shut down for maintenance on PS4 &amp; XB so might be today. I'm not positive though, been trying to figure it out myself. XD
---
I...  Will not lie thought i was looking at a ass for a second
---
where at?
---
Isn’t the console hotfix happening right now going to address this issue? It’s on the patch notes.
---
why even bother?
---
That would make my day!
---
You on Xbox? I'll be looking for people to run it with
---
It would be exactly the same except it would benefit the busy people. I play religiously everyday and would be just fine with this.
---
a lot of people are in denial
---
I am not even mad enough to have an alt. In every game I play, I play one character only but I like to change builds on that character. Which is why I left fo76 to begin with since swapping from melee / shotgun to rifle build aparently was a burden.
---
I just did this twice in a row with other people and efficient kills and it failed both times! Wtf
---
I use a bit of ammo converter, few good melee wepons to reduce ammo usage and I manage 🤔 I also have a couple weapons with different bullet types.
---
Jesus H! Finished Graham BBQ with 2 minutes before shutdown and scored the chally mask (have the outfit), woot!
---
Sounds good, I am on ps4 thou.
---
Ye they said it's a part of the HotFix today =)
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424802/update-hotfix-on-august-24-for-consoles?language%5B%5D=en
---
This is a top tip that should be at the top for everyone to read.
---
No, it should be that way so everyone gets what they paid for.
---
That explains the Delorean I saw last week....
---
Servers just went down
---
Check this page: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424802/update-hotfix-on-august-24-for-consoles?language%5B%5D=en
---
Im sure if you ask, or sometimes even if you dont, there is someone on ps4 that can help you out.
---
I run lucky hole mine in excavator power armor which you can do the quest for it at level 20?   
---
I think and what it does is doubles the amount of ore from veins.  I do one run of that and come out with over 1k lead scrap once you smelt it at the chemistry station, but the next problem becomes acid which you will need alot of also because it's use to make the lead scrap and gunpowder.
---
LOL yeah it's Colossal Problem. Sort by new, everyone.
---
It's finally happening, can't believe it!!!  Just hope it doesn't crash on the first nuke...
---
mmh, every 3 or 4 days?
---
I've got a jelly baby on it!
---
Yeah, I agree with what you said. Also, I didn't really know how to word the post well. This is literally is my first post in Reddit, ever.
---
If you're not using them... Why keep them?
---
Good to know. I had no tent the first time and failed it, and the second time I did place my tent and failed it anyway. So frustrating.
---
I was hoping they’d all reset in the morning along with the daily challenges.
---
I literally got the meat tenderizer plan right when servers shut down
---
Well you're in luck, that's exactly what it is
---
Hotfix today? How long downtime?
---
Thanks my man
---
Lol you got me. Guess I should’ve planned around that hour heads up they gave on one website.
---
It’s just a few minutes
---
No.
---
No. Just do the run or don’t. 
---
These suggestions trying to short cut the up coming legendary runs are pointless.
---
They're just in PTS at the moment. Hopefully they shouldn't be too long until they are added
---
Power connectors are never part of that challenge
---
welcome to the beautiful design of an mmo.
---
they are a business after all, sucks, but not something new to this type of games, they charge you for a solution to a problem they make
---
Thank you! Finally found one on deathclaw island!
---
Lol, well that's fantastic news.
---
Damn, got me all batty.
---
I'm sorry :(
---
First time i ever hear someone cry about them fixing and/or adding things to the game.
---
I am just glad to see it rolling out.
---
Ex’s toy. They want all the stuff without actually playing. Then what’s the point of having the stuff if they don’t actually play? Or want to play?
---
It makes it easier to sayayayayay!
---
Appreciate this tip. It’ll be a key prt of my route if this challenge appears again.
---
Hahah good point.
---
Yes I was about to post. I will be on after lunch gt is kingsites12 I am level 300 bloodied with my fixer. And I’ll be bringing my big daddy junkies mini just in case
---
Challenges are ok right now. Some of us have childs, work, etc. and don't have the time to take a photo in a nuke zone in pijamas while riding a mothman
---
Collosus
---
This is more plausible than an ill-placed tent.
---
Yes :(
---
Any idea how long for the patch ?
---
To add the patch that was rolled out to pc last week...
---
Collosus!
---
This is to introduce A Colossal Problem on console.  It's worth missing one or two barbeques
---
How long?
---
I think the nukes solved that problem already...
---
Omg the complaining on this sub is constant lmao
---
I'd expect at least a couple of hours.
---
I was told Col wasn’t till Thursday
---
Someone else posted that it's being updated literally right now.
---
I dunno
---
That was quick :/
---
There is still quite a few weeks left for your pass I'm sure everything is going to be okay.
---
No. Meat week runs 7 days. That was the original schedule. Should run brought Thursday.
---
And leather isn't too rare. Just hunt radstags.
---
Anyone want to join later I’m on Xbox and gt is kingsites12 I wil be out for a couple hours. I’m level 300 bloodied build. Don’t know if it will matter but let’s run it
---
It was meant to be Thursday last week
---
Sorting by new would save you from posting such embarrassing nonsense.
---
I thought about starting this exact thread on here. Kudos.
---
Just because they disagree with you, does not mean they are in denial. They just think differently.
---
Did they release a tweet of something?? Super pumped for this!
---
No, it's just to activate A Colossal Problem
---
Did cook off with 5 minutes to spare.
---
Bat's got me going 👁️👄👁️
---
IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?
---
I think it would be one of the first pas without actually hands but instead like a hoe or something in one hand and a fert machine in the other as for color scheme withiut a doubt brown i can definitly see it as a sort of open helment pa too
---
Hey it's not a BAD idea, just super unlikely lol.
---
Yep. Currently down for update.
---
Now this is something I would bat to
---
Bwhahaha
---
The absolute weirdest part is that many of the challenges just encourage me to hop over to an alt and do them there. All the camp building ones I skip on my main and do on my alt as I don't want to risk the odd foundation or stairs that I can't delete there. Now my alt has about 40 crops planted since I leave them instead of doing the plant and scrap to replant method like I should. 
---
Leveling my level 30 (was level 1 when the run started so I only took the easy route about half the time) is much easier than my level 245. I also only do the claim workshops on my alt as my main is always overweight and occasionally needs to carry scrap on him.
---
You new here?
---
Fuck yeah!
---
I’d hit that.
---
I don’t see hotfix notes, can you link me up?
---
Does this mean one wasteland aswell?!?!
---
thanks
---
The joker has to be around here somewhere if the bats is here.
---
I don't want to spoil anything so all I'm going to say is bring more ammo than you think you're going to need and have lots of stimpaks.
---
Lol, autocorrect, riiiiight.
---
Seriously though, I added Grahm to my keyboards dictionary so it stopped correcting to Graham.
---
Our group just barely completed our 10am cook. Server went offline at like 10:06.
---
Hmm. I guess using the Score to rank up for future Seasons might not be the best idea. It would take away from the experience of grinding to Rank 100 in future Seasons.
---
First nuke- we good? Yup -event-
---
2nd nuke CRASH
---
From the start of meat week I have been running around like a blue ass fly trying to get the tenderiser plan.
---
Then today at the 13:00 event I had to AFK on the drums to answer the door only to find I finally had the plan. 
---
Power of the drums people !! If you want the rarest plans get on those drums !
---
I was thinking I need to just run with a good melee weapon for a while and start storing all my finds.
---
Yeah there are definitely a lot of folks who are like that.
---
He's in the bushes getting off on it while simultaneously scheming
---
actually I mean event awards and dailies with allies.
---
I learned the hard way to not wait for the alert lol. I usually fast travel to Vault 76 about 2 to 3 minutes before it starts that way I don't miss it. Also I have been keep track of the time as I don't want to miss farming.
---
With a bat
---
It’s a difficult problem for players. While systems like these would be an appreciated bonus for sure, eventually the season runs just become an instant 100 reward items at the beginning of every season and removes any fun of working though the board day by day. 
---
Personally, I like having a few weeks where I don’t need to even worry about playing the game and few the fomo. It’ll let me come back at full force to enjoy the next wave of content.
---
Really? The event just take 1-2 min, less you doing it alone.
---
Im scared what they will break today
---
Now this is a good, well-rounded update.
---
Now I have something to do in between events!
---
I spent an hour hunting last night, never found one.  I gave up.  
---
I have plenty in my stash. lol

I'm always looking for disease cures any chance I can add you and come and check out ya vendors
---
Awh, another troll appeared on the subreddit.
---
Mine when off at exactly 10 still had 3 seconds left on two minute timer. But fuck that event I want end game shit
---
it's not about liking challenge or not, it's about forcing to play against the game logic
---
How big is the patch?  Or is it just a behind the scenes update?
---
My server finished it with 50 seconds to spare, made me smile
---
“556 ammo is disabled”
---
I disagree for peiple like me i can run that cap limit fown in a days tops in eso they have npc vendors but they dont have a limity to how much they can trade or a very low limit of gold *2.1 bil iirc*
---
Yeah it’s going to be ok. Just saying they gave a crappy heads up.
---
2 spots at the lighthouse i always check. IIRC its the second floor window of lighthouse and inside the house on the desk upstairs.
---
Nah that's a good setup.
---
Thank you, I just wanted to be one of the jerks who make a post when the servers go down. Don’t get me wrong I’m still a filthy Asshole who deserves to be downvoted
---
Imagine liking this game to the point you wanna play more than two hours. You must be brain dead.
---
Are bows in the same sad shape as gauss shotguns for VATS?
---
Still need one? I fell asleep lol
---
He's talking about things like "build 10 wall or floor decorations!" Or "plant fruit!" "Build 10 generators".
---
He is asking for **interesting** "challenges".  They should be called tasks of there's no challenge, too.  To me, a challenge indicates it should be fun and **challenging**.
---
What game logic? I build all Day, killed 3 creatures in total last week.... I play my way you play yours
---
Wherever you read that is an awful source for FO76 information.
---
Did you read the post?
---
Or, get this. 
---
You could've just used the build. 
---
Crazy I know.
---
I’m used to the posting updates for maintenance to their twitter feed. I get alerts from that. They didn’t this time, only 20 minutes before. It’s all good.
---
u/SaintMartini hey there, can you DM me your ticket number please?
---
As an average killer, I would give my tick a victim to feed on before butchering it.
---
Everything is getting nerfed, not just bloody and junkies...
---
I may have given a false impression.  I use the points as soon as I level.  I'm not saving any points.  I just checked and I don't have it in my strength cards.  What would you all do?
---
Jokes on you, everything is getting a nerf... Bloodied will probably be the only viable build now. You're going to be struggling to kill a ghoul with your vampire's handmade.
---
&gt; hope your ready to feel the pain we normal players go through cause youve had it coming for years
---
If only there was a pvp element to adventure for this to matter.
---
What I don't get is why Excavator PA doesn't have an option like drill hands. Instead of a hand for hand to hand combat, you have this big ass drill that you gouge enemies with.
---
Not so easy to melt earl with a magic weapon unless u catch him right in the beginning.  
---
I would up soloing earl yesterday cause I dropped a nuke on an empty server I just joined.  Didn’t realize it was empty till I dropped nuke.  Only 2 camps showing on map. 
---
Waited and waited and no one joined in on the fight.   Tried to melt earl quick and got him down to almost regen then the wendigo came and made it hard to keep the straight line on fire on him to trigger magic effect.  
---
Took some time but I got it done.   The slapping the wendigo do is annoying trying to solo earl.  Lol

I call that obvious bluff.
---
WE DID IT, BOYS!!! GET 'EM OUT!!!
---
Most def hit me up. Let’s show earl what’s up
---
How long do we think the update will take?
---
I only do this if its a cheap legendary wi 4th way more value had found a quad explosive revolver for like 200 went and resold it for 1600
---
STONKS
---
They're still going to be the strongest builds in the game since they're nerfing all damage across the board, so I'm not sure what you're so giddy about.
---
Well, I guess the rank up with Score for future Seasons is not the best Idea. However, I believe the extra Score after getting Rank 100 should have a purpose. 
---
Maybe, it could be used as some sort of currency or something.
---
There are a lot of perks that will help you out there, but it’s always a struggle. Buying from other players helps-are you always getting max caps every day from selling stuff to NPC vendors? (1400 caps) Also you should server hop when the items are not there. Don’t overlook seemingly “smaller” items containing lead. There are tin can chimes at  Morgantown airport (near the steps up to the airplane) and Camden park. Lots of items containing lead in Flatwoods, definitely recommend doing a full looting round there. Also make use of the ammo converter when you can. Get familiar with all the items containing lead if you’re not a compulsive looter of everything you see. And lastly I’m happy to help you out anytime, you can add me (IGN is highlytrainedpaw)and I’ll be happy to give you some 10mm ammo. At higher levels most people are doing Lucky Mine runs several times a week, and buying ammo from other players, though it’s definitely dried up somewhat after the ammo converters got fixed. It’s never 100% easy, it’s always a bit of a grind at times (I’m level 130, heavy guns PA armor full health build) but I make use of perks like Super Duper and Ammosmith. Hang in there bro!
---
EVERYTHING is getting nerfed though. Everybody is worse off and underpowered weapons are peashooters. It's currently just a damage change that hasn't been fully fleshed out yet so we don't know what the final product will even be yet
---
Actually, it should be the same - since Vampire isn't an affect being rebalanced.
---
I’ve been there too!
---
Even worse, it will still tell you that you're hidden when it's pretty clear you're not. 
---
You will no longer being doing extra stealth damage and every single NPC is attacking you but it'll still claim you're hidden. Seems to happen most often during the SBQ fight.
---
Or you could add purified water to your favorite wheel
---
I heard weapons got nerfed too. Is that not true?
---
the game is harder in pts, its a fact ;)
---
Oh i used to hunt bloodieds back on survival with my stealth sniper, good times..
---
They need Food, Water and Stimpacks at least thats what they buy at my shop.
---
Maybe some Radaway
---
But the rest of yout setup is pretty good
---
Same. Hit it last night. What's your build, if you dont mind?
---
A "nerf" is a more appropriate term if it only affected a single or a few builds. This is a rebalance of the way damage is calculated across the board - so anything that uses a damage multiplier is going to affected in some way.
---
mmh... yes they are.
---
It does still work, but for me it only works successfully with gun fu.
---
We don't have time for sensible solutions!
---
So ive been through more weapon nerfs than possible and i doubt its going to be as big of a nerf than to bloodied builds
---
at least someone gets it... :)
---
Didn't survival get canned before bloodied builds were popular? By like... months?
---
Sorry I assumed you had First based on your statement about unlimited stash not helping.
---
Maybe the games not for you than.
---
Edit: you dont need First, you can use a friend to hold the world too, its just not as safe.
---
servers went down at 10 after
---
One GB for Xbox
---
Heh, I'll wait until you find out that you will do even less damage, then I'll really laugh at you.
---
😂😂
---
I mean i play bloodied and not really. It's really funny who decides when it's ezpz and when it's god mode depending on the conversation. 
---
Schrodinger's Bloodied Cat.
---
More to the point between all the evade perks and negation perks it's more a suprise when you do die due to the shock. 
---
And if you are truly a bloodied build and run unyielding? 
---
Extra breezy mode
---
  Sometimes I buy overpriced stuff because I'm nearing max caps - and that item is something I don't have.  I may not really \_need\_ it, but I buy it just to lower the cap balance.   
---
I'm a melee build - bought a couple 1\* melee weapons this week for 1000-1500 caps, just to lower my cap balance. 
---
In those cases, the seller was in the right place at the right time.
---
Other times, its something I've been looking for, but not finding.  the FOMO thing - bite the bullet and scoop it up lest you don't see it again.
---
Or a combination of both.  as a Melee build, the Fixer is not a primary weapon choice for me - but I wanted the plan.  No luck at Encrypted.  
---
Stumbled across the plan a player vendor - with a 5 digit price tag.  But I had 26k caps at the time.  The plan is now in my inventory.
---
Wait the tenderizer plan is rare? I have got 3 of them
---
Base damage isn't changed. Vampire doesn't affect damage (Quad doesn't either).
---
There may be some damage change based on perk card calculation (like Bloody Mess, for instance), but that difference won't be felt nearly as much.
---
Took a couple of minutes downloading at 55-65 Mbps
---
Exactly. This isn't even the final product anyways, as far as I know
---
I have been a big fan of the series since the first fallout. When 76 came out, it kind of turned me off. But I just started it up last week and I have to say. The changes they have made are making it much more fun. They still have an occasional glitch or bug, but nothing to bad. Except for that crazy looking light glitch on PS4 that looks like light streamers falling from the sky. Also my sky is broken into two seperate boxs that look like two different images that are not lined up. But overall, its been very fun.
---
That’s the thing. It’s not a hotfix if we have server downtime.
---
Free samples are supposed to be a sample, not the whole pie
---
All stackable damage got nerfed too. So if you run multiple damage cards, bloody mess and drugs, your damage will be severely nerfed too.
---
Hopefully the hot fix today will fix it.. if not then bethesda just lost nearly every new player they gained with wastlanders original release
---
Only heard the damage was lower, doesn't really make it harder, just means I need a few more bullets. Did I miss anything?
---
I just started a new character   My low level has zero caps when I reached the wayward. There is no where to sell until then and I would have very few items to sell. I usually drop items for low levels, not sell to them. Just my observation
---
If you have ammo to sell, now is the time to fire up the vendors. I blew all mine on meat week, I imagine other players are getting low also.
---
 Hotfix for what? There are so many things wrong with its game this could mean anything?
---
I think I faced a similar issue with the perk card not working. Hopefully it’ll be fixed with today’s maintenance
---
One thing to contemplate...
---
People will be looking to buy more ammo. It will be interesting to see how this pans out.
---
I wasted my entire budget on sheepsquatch plushies. I have them all over my camp participating in fun activities.
---
I think I faces a similar issue with the perk card not working. Hopefully it’ll be fixed with today’s maintenance.
---
Having just wrapped this up yesterday, here’s my honest and most constructive feedback ...
---
1. They should not tie season progress to challenges until they fix the autocomplete bug and the other glitched world challenges. When the building blocks of your season are bugging out, it’s begging for problems and negative feedback.
---
2. People talk about FOMO, but this sub did more to encourage my already compulsive behavior with all the early panic about no way to finish without purchasing ranks (false), having to play NW to keep up (also false), and all the “you could be really behind” daily scorecard updates. In hindsight, I wish I hadn’t read half of what was posted on here and just played the game.
---
3. The rewards were messy. It seemed like the devs reached into the barrel for a handful of quasi tested cosmetics and sprinkled them across the game board. In future seasons, I would hope the rewards would be more in line with the theme. And quality tested. It doesn’t get more Bethesda than a skin that renders an entire camp invisible.
---
4. Overall season length could easily be pared down to 50 ranks. After 50, it really began to drag. Maybe shorter and more frequent seasons would help.
---
5. The grand finale felt neither grand nor a finale. Not even a congratulations banner on the screen. The Legendary Run just ... stops in the most non legendary way possible. Very underwhelming.
---
So in summary, glad I gave it a fair chance. Even more glad I did not have to waste atoms on this. As with most aspects of this game, seasons have a lot of untapped potential. But I think I can credit the devs for curing my FOMO. I am entirely ambivalent about season 2.
---
Good point - players in the PTS have noticed odd things with the damage calculations "as-is," especially with melee weapons.
---
I expect we'll see a few iterations of changes before this goes live.
---
I don't want to apply my experience with the game as a blanket across everyone, so I understand not everyone sees it as a grind. I know others like myself do feel this way however. If you're able to play about 2 hours every day then you're likely not going to have a problem with the Legendary Run.
---
As far as it being the easiest grind I would only challenge that because you do not lose progress in any other reputation grind (faction reputation for instance) because it is not timed. It does however provide much more frequent and worthwhile rewards than the other reputation grinds which makes it a little less tedious.
---
You know its bad when the lvl 30 is taking all the pylons while the lvl 100-300s are just, honestly, I had no idea what they were doing
---
How long are we looking at?
---
I usually have a sign that says ‘free’ or ‘for the noobs’ on a vendor close to where I assume they walk past, I’ve had basically no luck though. Some douche came in and cleaned out all my purified water and free plans one day and he was a lvl 201
---
If a player is only logging on to do the dailies and not the play the game in general, then I guess you could call spending 15-60 minutes a day a grind.
---
When this season started, people were all, You'll have to log in every single day to complete the Legendary Run. You can't miss a day!
---
But that turned out not to be true. There's like 3 weeks left, and I'm about to finish the run, without playing every day, with one autocomplete, and no grinding the repeatable XP. I've got 3 ranks left to go. Originally I had planned to save all the Atoms and buy the last 10 or so ranks, so I wouldn't worry about not completing it.
---
Now I get to keep all those Atoms and complete the run a few weeks early. 
---
So it's not a grind, unless you're bored playing the game.
---
It's broken on ticks, it used to work but now it doesn't.
---
so you just heard? ok.
---
good talk.
---
I tried a low level shop and gave up as noobs just didn't want to buy stuff. I would go out of my way to farm leader of the pack for low level legendarys and still no dice.
---
Got loads of 5 scrip though.
---
This is the Hotfix for Patch 21, which drops Colossal Problem &amp; deep pockets for SS armor (plus fixes the wall issues).
---
They're changing how damage buffs stack, like from perks, legendary effects, mutationsn etc. So the more separate damage buffs you stack, the more your damage will be nerfed. Since all builds are stacking at least some damage, everyone gets nerfed at least a little. But Bloodied has the most damage buffs, so it gets hit the hardest.
---
Why are energy weapons seeing such a massive nerf compared to other weapons?
---
And you can get back into the game?
---
Exactly, some of the calculations have been discovered to be wrong. Bethesda has never been too great with numbers anyways. Whatever happens I just hope it fixes the rubber banding and general damage delay
---
Not sure, that guy posted a helpful link above and it has a forum they will post on when it’s up. I also assume there will be spam posts about the servers being up too. Ima just go play fo4 for a while
---
Here's the post I learned this in. They posted pictures of the different spots where stuff spawns there. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here_is_why_lost_home_is_the_bomb_yo/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Yah, I think there’s something to it. Just hard to figure that out. Especially in a way that players can’t take advantage of it or Bethesda can’t monetize it more than what’s fair. I really don’t even have a clue what that answer is
---
Thanks. Yea. I have been becoming a bit more of a horder lately. Just make runs and then break everything down.
---
Oh.. Another dumdum that doesn't understand that the nerf affects all damage calculations. Bloodied and Junkies will still be the best weapon prefixes.
---
You can always just drink the water from the source. 🤔
---
Self-burn
---
I rather assume a seamless transition.
---
It may be the changes to the stacking / additive effects - it may also be a bug. Personally, I believe that energy weapons need an increase in base damage numbers, not a decrease (I love my plasma rifle).
---
If I had to guess, I think it's a bug right now &amp; will get changed again in the next PTS drop.
---
I see people trying to sell the bloody chef outfits for high prices. I had so many of those things last year I ended up scrapping a ton.
---
Yup. If u have 3 on drums and spits during warmup time it basically almost auto completed the event.
---
Is the Camo Underarmor part of this fix?
---
I’ve seen that camp, or similar. PS4?
---
It was standing gorilla statue with neon letters BLM under it.
---
Gat lasers can have the BoS skin from NW (If you’re willing to play that) but yeah, UGL’s and Plasma Gats are out of luck currently.
---
I was off doing something else when survival got canned, but I remember bloody builds being pretty popular not long after launch. It didn't take long for people to figure out how broken that mechanic was and start leveraging it. Of course, it wasn't the prevailing meta just yet -- you could still hurl a rock and have a chance of not hitting (and killing) one -- but they were around.
---
Yes and im positive im the reason they werent popular
---
No, just took that long for the client side stuff. Still waiting for the servers to finish. 
---
Probably what the question was about in the first place....
---
Don't think so? I'm level 100 in nw. The bos skin is for mini guns
---
Wait seriously? I've been trying for over 24 hours now and you're saying if I go on a private server it will work?
---
colossal problem incoming
---
damn sure does
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
Use this , unlselect all then select bobbleheads
---
it has little text descriptions on where to look.
---
I personally not looking forward to this update. I don't run a bloodied build or junkie build either. Just a heavy gunner build so I'm sure it won't be easy/fun anymore. But I guess we'll see.
---
Yes legendary tenderizers are a thing now.
---
Best of luck!
---
Idk and no orgies are allowed here
---
There was a post on here saying you have more control of the direction you flee to in 3rd person mode. We'll find out soon enough...
---
Think I’ve gotten all of them.  Got 3 tenderizers and all the mods.
---
Someines mad  also they are only nerfing stacking damage buffs and i dont stack those needlessly i just take 1 card and im good
---
Maybe.
---
I'm not sure people are doing Prime Cuts as diligently as they were last year.  For one, the event is quite glitchy with enemies failing to spawn, which means no completion and no reward.  Two, because Grahm's Meat-Cook counts progress on the drums and spits during the prep time, you're unlikely to be able to deposit more than a handful of Prime Meat before the BBQ ends.  And three, the main reward of Scrip for turning in Prime Meat just isn't as *fresh* as it was last year.  The Treasury Notes are nice, though.
---
The only way to AFK. Last night there were two AFK'ers in the middle of the event spinning around (the old rubber band on the controller trick) and not enough actual people doing the event to complete it in time. Did I unload a few hundred rounds of explosive 5.56 into their faces? Yes. Did it do anything to their characters? No. Did it make me feel slightly better? Yes.
---
Just get a fucking mod.
---
Stupid, sexy Scorch Beast.
---
They fix something and break something in the process lol
---
Ha, that's pretty good
---
How do you do that?
---
Cool, that works on console...
---
Yep. I tried initially on public, put the fuse in and then the blood sample but it said sample couldn't be found. Hopped into private, the fuse was replaced in my inventory and the blood sample apparently stayed in the centrifuge. So I analyzed first, then replaced the fuse.
---
You need high damage players, otherwise be prepared for a looooong slog :-)
---
Agreed. I've been trying every possible loophole in the hopes that I could then put it on Reddit to help others but it's quite literally impossible to avoid. I tried getting the storyline done before the Brotherhpod update but I cant seem to progress through this at all. It renders the game useless which is such a shame.
---
Good. I've barely had chance to play it this time around.
---
no, why would you think that
---
This is a pretty good write-up. I myself am only rank 70, so I have quite a ways to go. I agree the season should be much, much shorter (50 or so spaces instead of 100). I also really dislike that the XP required for each level keeps increasing as you get further along the board. This should be a flat rate instead of a steep curve.
---
No it goes to the 26th I think or 28th man I need to lay off the Mary Jane my memory is shot ....It's one of those dates anyways.
---
Yep I've seen them on the trading reddit. I just spent 900 script trying to get one. Then I realized I forgot to learn the plan.
---
I don't know what to tell you if you use console.
---
I complete the building challenges every time. I’ve never built a connector. Lights, yes. Connector, no.
---
My uny/ap/sent Scout limbs are a rough thing to pass up, lol. I'm holding over with a cham/str/wwr chest but if your old pre-Wastelanders gear was really good, it's near impossible to replace unless you want far inferior rolls.
---
holy shit this is big news.
---
How do I get on a private server? I dont have Fallout 1st sadly
---
It's Monday, thought it ran Monday to Sunday.
---
Nope bloodied and junkies got a overall fucking nerf and they are nerfing damage stacking which btw wont affect me so basically the more damage you stack the less you do and bloodied builds are just that, may you scream and cry wailing about while everyone else has actual fun without you one shotting everything
---
Yea I heard and saw what the youtubers showed me, and read what the patch notes said... None of them say the game became harder, just that people won't be able to 1 shot some enemies anymore.
---
If you are on about One Wasteland, that hardly makes it harder... I see level 62+ enemies now as a lvl 30, it makes it easier if anything. Only makes you need more ammo because you won't see level 5s anymore as a lvl 50+.
---
Only thing that happens is that loot becomes level appropriate, boo-hoo you need 2 more bullets to kill someone.
---
The fact that you couldn't properly answer me, means you had no clue and are in fact just saying people are in denial, simply cause they disagree.
---
You made me spit my coffee out you SOB !
---
I just started last week and the wayward may seem like a good place, but no one will have any caps to buy anything for a while.  By the time people get to Charleston, they may have enough caps to start getting stuff.
---
you were playing Meat Week 3 days before everyone else? Lucky!
---
Then it seems maybe the only real solution is for me to stop logging in. Well it was fun while it lasted I suppose.
---
No, just add the Atom shop music to everything else.  Then all will be perfect.
---
It'll still be going when the servers come back up, this maintenance is just to introduce 'A Colossal Problem'
---
You'll just have to ask around until you find someone on your platform who will let you join. I'm on Xbox, if you are as well you can play on my server when I get home this evening.
---
I got thr full set a few times. I just gave them to low levels. Same with all the repeats. I just want the chally suit( I got the head piece) the grill flag and salad recipe. I got the chally feed recipe. And tenderizer plan a few times already
---
Thanks for the info. 
---
Damn! Was hoping they might finally fix the fast travel problem. Or something else that people have been complaining about for years. lol
---
They can drop from dailies or events as well.
---
I love smoking and wandering the wasteland.
---
Yep. Got past it just the other day doing this. The thought is that it will work once on a server, then it's broken for anyone else who tries to complete it on that server until it's recycled. Since nobody has completed it before you on your private server, it "just works."
---
I'm level 268 and I feel that way.
---
Just got an instigating, 40 power attack, +1 strength today :D
---
Runs to the 26th. Double Score Weekend is over 2 hours early though.
---
It could have started last Monday for all I know.
---
A new event I think! *hopes*
---
Gamebryo
---
It was very common on Xbox during Fasnacht. You could never complete a SBQ fight or Encryptid because everyone was either AFK or there were maybe a dozen players on the server.
---
The irony is that youre a Brotherhood member posting this.
---
Unfortunate, but thank you for letting me know.  It'd have been nice for a warning from the game too.  I guess I got used to how single player Bethesda games save right after creation.
---
Hopefully it won't crash on me while doing the ID card this time.
---
W O T
---
Hmm a day early, figured they would have just waited till tommorow with it being Tuesday
---
If 3 people play the drums and two people turn the spit for the entire 2 minutes of "getting ready", the event starts at 2/3 completion. Because of that, I was able to complete in 26 seconds. Also, it allowed me to complete two events that hour, and a friend got 3 done. 
---
Bless you, drum players. AFK all you want.
---
Hey still helped me out, downloading the update now!
---
Just looked at the wiki and it doesn't say it can go on gat lasers. Will double check once servers are back up
---
Thanks, and yes I completely agree with you now
---
"What is Monday without Thursday? Think about it..."
---
-Grahm
---
I suppose it could still work in PVE to some extent. But I think 99% of fad builds were either a TSE or even just explosive build or just some PA build.
---
If I was you I'd hold off on character speccing until the new update drops and something is set in stone. I'm grinding out levels so when it does I'll have plenty of perk points to adjust my builds if needed. Just my opinion, as to your question... As unarmed and shotgun damage perks are in the same category I'd probably choose one or then other for max damage.
---
Well, you could always chuck the problem Legendaries in your vending machine and sell them for cheap Scrip for someone else to buy.
---
I guess this is my sign to go to sleep after playing for like 30 hours... It’s just odd that they didn’t post anything. Hopefully it’s not done for a couple days like the pc servers were. Unless I’m misremembering
---
Just imagine what else is in store.
---
Up by crater, there's a spot where ur camp can reach both junk and lead. It's north east of Grafton
---
The FT bug is just plain weird. Some players (like me) have no issues, but other players have it all the time.
---
I can see how something like that might be hard to track down.
---
Wanna help? Put up up some free food. And sell everything else how you usually would whether it's high or low level. Then you help everyone and no douche will come and take it. Chances are it's alt accounts. Plus majority of low legendaries are often used for like 30 mins most since people can go from level 10 to 25 in one line in the sand event. 🤔
---
Have to get some caps to get ready for the big move.
---
Sure. Magic shotguns or armor that makes shotguns magic would go a long way to making this build. I run an unarmed character with a 15% damage while blocking Chest Piece which makes all shotguns magic. The only downside is my shotgun tends to kill everything, so no punchy. I can't say how crippling would work if you choose to run magic shotties.
---
Actually I am on Xbox as well lol, i played it first on PS4 over a year ago but because i sold it, I got it on GamePass on Xbox and have been trying to play through it solo. It's not as enjoyable on your own, but I have no friends on Xbox who would touch this game so I'm kinda left with no choice. If you could shoot me a message to my gamertag WelshMaestro when you're on, that would be great. Thanks.
---
M14
---
I'll add, is that after you've added the additional ammo that you didn't think you needed you should consider a little more.  Also, try not to find yourself between Earl and the drills.
---
And then they instantaneously tunnel through concrete to behind you on the TOP OF A ROOF
---
Doesn't affect you? You don't have weapon related damage perks like rifleman or commando etc? Or bloody mess? Or adrenaline? Or tenderizer? Hate to break it to you, but enemies die just as fast as they ever did on PTS. It might take one extra bullet which means fraction of a second more on killing time. Also, if you actually knew anything about this game you would know that you can oneshot enemies even with a non-legendary weapon if you know what you are doing. I love when idiots like you think they know shit and come whining and crying here.
---
Thanks! Appreciate the tip!
---
Nurf has nothing to do with it, there's a cap on damage, it's more about how fast you can fire.
---
That's certainly a possibility but it doesn't say that anywhere.
---
How's your build? Builds are quite important to make sure your damage is alright
---
You have only 1 unarmed dmg boost perk. I guess bloodied unarmed? Then you don't need any more dmg Perks for unarmed. The rest can be done via mutations. Shotgun Perks are also at strength so get lvl 3 Blocker, lvl 3 iron fist and then you have 9 points left for the 3x20% dmg boost Perks. If you got 15 at strength.
---
Can't see that happening
---
Jesus. I guess that's one way to plug your overpriced subscription. "Pay now and be able to carry on with the base game storyline!" 🤦‍♂️😂
---
I’ll be on the lookout for this going forward. Thanks!
---
I'll be honest, I've heard people talk about this magic thing a lot, but I have no idea what it is! Is it a glitch?
---
No prob. I will be on in ~7 hours. I'll message you now so you have my contact.
---
Oh sweet I can complete that pet and do the new event!
---
Damn. Also should have waited for the sale, unless you can max back out before then. Don't know when it is haha
---
Pick the right spot to shoot.   Use concentrated fire and scroll through the heads.   I’ll hit for 30-40 swap heads and I’m in the 160-170 range.   Non prime.
---
Try a different build. My shotgun build definitely feels lacking, but my rifle build and my heavy weapons builds feel just right.
---
Right after you select NW game mode a screen pops up explaining the game mode. On PS4 you hit square to toggle the ‘full team’ option.
---
https://www.falloutmaps.com/#!/ 
---
Use this and you can select resource nodes to be displayed for it camp
---
That would honestly be terrible. You kill a legendary enemy and spend a couple minutes finding it. After a bit you sigh, take off some perks, put the legendary detecting perk on, find it, get a one star, then take it off and put your old ones back on. That doesn’t sound fun at all. IMO the best idea would be to imitate an old glitch where they still had the green particle effect after they died
---
Well, the point is pretty obvious - Bethesda prioritizes daily logins over hours spent per day.  Partly because every trip to the title screen is another chance to rope you into the Atomic Shop.  Partly because it lightens the load on their servers.  Partly because their game simply doesn't hold up to hours and hours of constant play.
---
The easiest workaround is to create an alt character.  Spec them however you want - maybe they do something that's the total opposite of your main.  And when the main cashes out for the day, fire up the alt.
---
If you have 1st, or a trusted friend to transfer stuff, you can treat the two characters in a shared fashion.  Trying to level up an alt is a healthy drain on resources, as you craft gear and goodies they wouldn't normally have.

I'm running a [shotguns/semi-auto pistols/unarmed build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f7938b3&amp;d=pb2pc2ee2so2sp2sd2ad2ak2al2a61lt2ic4i12p60s92ej4cu2ss2&amp;ad=0478a&amp;n=Jay%20Dub) right now. There aren't quite enough strength points for everything you'd want, I ended up giving up incisor, but you could sacrifice master shotgunner if you're primarily interested in the shotguns for crippling. Just running shotguns and unarmed means you have nothing for long range, but if scorchbeasts land when crippled that's not too important.
---
Probably. While the update is happening look up Angry Turtle's video on magic shotguns. It takes the guy some time to explain everything, but he is thorough.
---
This thing is still going on? I forgot all about it
---
Finally deep pockets for SS
---
The PC hotfix had the servers down for a couple of hours IIRC
---
Wait what? Update at Monday? What did I miss?
---
Someone is making that alcoholic drink that makes you get a disease every time you hit enemy for putting it up in the bowl for everyone to drink on? 🤔
---
If you notice they only go after the lower lvl guys    Had some over weekend doing that to my wife that is new and has been grinding it out to get to 50 which she did.  But they didn’t expect my daughter to come and one shot them dead   It was hilarious.  I was in passive mode so I was useless but they didn’t come back
---
Oh wow didn't realize there was an actual update. Figured it was just an in-game hotfix.
---
I think my perk was bugging out, or rather my connection was inefficient to get it to work. I ended up finding one based on a tip and had the perk on. No sound even when I was right in front of it. I’m hoping it’ll be fixed with today’s maintenance
---
Colossal Problem is getting dropped
---
Colossal disappointment is ready?
---
Or all the variants of Fasnacht
---
I thought it was really clever.  Yeah it does get old like the 5th time you do it but all quests are that way imo.
---
Indeed
---
How does changing the target improve your damage?
---
It's still trashy as fuck, I literally had no chance. I shot this person just to barely do even even the slightest bit of damage all for him to one shot me at full health while wearing power armor.
---
Hold on...I think we’re onto something.
---
I don't know what is up with that bug? But it seems like it is getting worst? It used to take me 2 maybe 3 times to go somewhere. But here lately it has been taking 5 or 6 tries. It is crazy when you are trying to get to the Queen fight before someone kills her in 30 sec.
---
Yes, it is
---
Games more of a PVE game with a little bit of crappy PvP on the side. 
---
Why people choose this game for PvP I will never know. So many great PvP games out there. Fallout 76 is not one of them and never will be.
---
I will just wave when someone trys to start PvP with me as like you said it's not a fair playing field, if you are shooting me with a BE Handmade and I am holding a bloodied boxing glove ( which is my go to daily as who doesn't want to feel like Mike ? ) 
---
I know you will walk over me in seconds so why would I bother. I know it's not the most popular anymore but if i want to PvP I go play crucible in Destiny 2.  
---
At least the gunplay is good in that game unlike fallout 76.
---
It's a stronger, unique version of the Wendigo Colossus fought inside Monongah Mine. It's way bulkier and there are lots of environmental hazards.
---
I’ve been noticing some enemies not marking as hostile right away (health bar and name don’t go red)
---
and so won’t let you VATS them.
---
I hear ya. I just don't have anything that you can put a shush tube on. I'm 100% energy weapons. I might screw around with with the Gauss pistol since it's energy and can have a silencer.
---
Then you'll still be weaker than most, good for you?
---
Ohhhh noh!
---
Chinese stealth armor.
---
It was clever but it just got way too old way too quick
---
This one is tougher and there's environmental hazards in the fight area
---
So, turned it in last night, and got more rep than I was expecting. So might be something to it. I haven't turned in the raider one yet, so will see how that goes. I'm cooperative with raiders and friendly with settlers, so should be more noticeable when I turn in raiders daily.
---
I think it’s over, at least for me..
---
Read the patch notes it’s hot fixes and col problem
---
Coming out
---
Hell yea finially time to get my meat pile plan.... Thanks for the info!
---
Yeah! People did say that players had to log on everyday to get to Rank 100. However, right now, I'm on Rank 99 and there still alot of time in the Season. So, I happy that I got everything and having alot of Atoms. It was not a grind,  and I'm having fun blasting enemies with my weapons on 5 different characters.
---
However, I know that there are people who simply do the challenges or AFK in events and Nuclear Winter. For them, it may be a grind. Why does some people buy a game to simply do the bare minimum in the game. Just play the game naturally and you'll get what you want and have fun. Yet, I know that many people have many reasons and some are good and some are bad.
---
I have never played an mmo where I had a cap on the amount of in game currency vendors could pay me in a day for my random loot. There may be limitations on how often I can attempt certain content and there is certainly rng involved in drops but to gate things as heavily as 76 does really highlights how little there is in the game. It launched nearly 2 years ago and has as far as I can tell no actual thing to do at end game outside of 2 bosses (one of which was just released). The more this discussion goes on the more reasons I see to jump ship and spend the time I would be playing searching for some other game.
---
He has massive damage resistance compared to the normal one, way way more :-)
---
Yep, all charging weapons, so gauss shotgun, rifle, and pistol, and bow/compound bow.
---
I'm not sure about charging barrels for lasers/teslas, but I'd assume so.
---
Sweet! Im looking forward to it!
---
Oh for sure, that's just me projecting. I know I sell all of my junk weapons for cheap hoping to help out lower players build up some scrip. However i would say 80% of the time it's level 200-400 players that buy out my entire stock.
---
I'm not trying to be cool, keep playing your broken, grindy, game that every other gaming community thinks is a joke. Y'all look up to these streamers but there the only smart ones making money off of a broken game. Y'all are just low iq fanboys.
---
I'm trying a stealth rifle build right now
---
I run shotguns on one of my characters but to be honest I have to switch to something else depending on who I’m fighting... I carry a non legendary handmade and a non legendary LMG to do long distance damage
---
Awesome! Ive solo’d the normal one so hopefully this one can be more group involved!
---
I’m lvl 267 as well feel same. Just now starting to figure out how builds work. I’m a noob at builds. Been playing to enjoy game not really paying attention to builds.  My wife just got to lvl 50 this weekend as well. CONGRATS!!!   Good thing is there’s always people around to help with events ( win or lose ). I figure if I can do my best and receive the rewards and some drops I’m doing my job.
---
Not an issue with SBQ melting weapons, very hard with run of the mill stuff :-)
---
I’ll probably be on late tonight (East US). I’m due for a lucky hole mine run. Shoot me a message on here if you’re interested.
---
I got excavator PA for more ore per vein, ammosmith for more ammo per craft and super duper for even more ammo.
---
It's mainly a stealth rifle build so it's kinda hard to help out as much in events like primal cuts
---
Just watched a vid explaining it my build will still more or less be doing the same damage actually might be doing more so i laugh in your face
---
I am level 485 and only now have I finally got a armoury I am proud of.
---
No legacy though as I refuse to do any trading in this game.
---
I agree with this one.  I think elevator/lobby music makes me more productive
---
**Bell is that you?**
---
Hell, it shits itself *not* trying.
---
What do you mean by environmental hazards
---
I pvp but I don't have a cheese build where my survivability is based on how many quantums and stealthboys I have. If you're getting 1 shot then it's your armor, and if you're referring to splash damage from a legacy laser or Explosive gun then just use dense and fireproof. Happy to give you some tips if you tell me how you play and who you was fighting against, as in what they were using.
---
Yeah, guess some things never change. We'll always feel like noobs no matter how good we are.
---
And much, much more spawn Wendingo too.
---
Oh that's nice!
---
Guess we're all noobs in our hearts.
---
Op stated in the post that it was a nuke that he had launched
---
Dont buy the bath water
---
Sweet!   That's right by my camp!   $$$
---
There 3 heads.  If I’m locked on shooting at the head on his other side I’m obviously not hitting his head hence the lower damage.  
---
Switch heads let me lock on the the head that’s actually on my line of fire.
---
i was being tearing down by the enemies during the daily ops last time too... but I will overcome this to get that PTS banner....
---
Show me that Crystal Cavern Bay-BEEE
---
Is that you mr. Bubbles?
---
There was a workaround posted yesterday that seems to work, it’s to do with fast traveling away
---
Not whining or crying just dancing on dead bloodied builds graves because now whenever i see a pos bloodied user i can actually take a few hits and no. I read how the new damage works if anything my build will be doing MORE damage since i dont rely on damage legendary effects
---
And you'll still be doing less damage than most, it's honestly not that hard to understand.
---
At least with Steel Dawn, the answer is no. And lore-wise, the BOS didn't get Vertibirds until they defeated the Enclave in Fallout 3.
---
nah, during bossfights hard to target the smaller mobs
---
I'm sorry, but at this point you should just go for an "Unyielding armor set" for an extra +15 intelligence minimum. Intelligence isn't the most useful thing to add to a power armor. If somebody can correct me if i'm wrong, i would really like to know if it is actually possible to compete against an Unyielding armor set on that aspect.
---
If you are wondering why i'm telling you that, it's because personnally I gotta put my power armor aside and use my Unyielding armor set if i want to maximise my xp gain (with 40 intelligence right now). So yea, i'm assuming you are looking for some extra xp gain.
---
Six, technically. 8/20-8/26.
---
Yeah, it's fun. You need to run when it tells you if you want to make it out (the first time takes  a bit to find your way out). Or you can stay and loot them Wendigos, even if the mine collapses on you you get spawned outside and still get rewarded, so no big deal.
---
But its more effective than toxic goo!
---
Huh... Gonna have to test that out. Do you have footage?
---
Would be even better with the play as ghoul option.
---
The Golden Ghouls
---
The Moldin' Girls
---
you really should had marked this NSFW.
---
Cup half full: more screws and acid!
---
i believe you are correct about this. i noticed it several times over the course of doing the primal cut events. at one of the events i seen both a male and female character in the middle of the air where you start the event, both naked i might add, but just running on the spot and when i opened the map, sure enough they were not there
---
don't get me started on enemy spawns this time around. i don't like to complain about small stupid stuff but i mean this was ridiculous. they would spawn lord only knows how far from the event area and sometimes they got stuck behind a tree or something. in the toxic valley one there were a couple instances where the spawn never showed but the marker does. mind you i was more to the events for the XP than i was for loot. 
---
did you also notice that the first few days there was almost no event popping up in the forest area? i only seen it a couple times and that was on sunday
---
I played shitload of mmo's in the past 15 years, I don't remember any of them having mechnics to literally prevent me from playing the game after a couple of hours. This kind of dumbness only exist in shitty F2P mobile games where you have to wait for a bar to fill up to be able to do stuff.
---
What? How can your shotgun build be lacking when you don't need a shotgun build for shotguns to be one shot killers ?? Are you using a "magic" shotgun ? If not get one and then get rid of every perk for shotguns and setup for melee then use the shotgun in Vats...one hit kills constant.
---
YouTube "angry turtle magic weapons" if you are not sure what i am talking about.
---
I emptied 10 gailting plasma mag on a legendary webdigo colossus and still his health haven't moved
---
I only thought it was bad until my game froze right when I was about to hand in the last thing and I had to reload and start from the beginning. 😭 Then it was unbearable. I think I waited three days before trying again lol
---
Damn that's hot,  how much??
---
Sure.  Add me on PSN and send me a message.  I probably won’t be on until early evening (4-5 PST) but I’m happy to help whenever we can make it work
---
I don't want to spoil anything and while there isn't massive spoilers in this you may find some hints or answers to what your suggesting... the video does mention vertibirds at one point. Keep in mind its datamined and subject to change
---
https://youtu.be/7pHEme4vgck
---
Yeah but swapping all the cards, again. Easier to kill everything!
---
Yes, I left the mine with 110 screws and 109 acids, plus a hell lot of jaws (+ acid).
---
I just started a new character the other day and am dreading doing that one again. My brain's still sore from the last time.
---
Take 100 then :-)
---
Good. Hopefully I can finally get deep pocketed mods for my SS armor.
---
PA is for PVE and has no real place in pvp, even if you spam quantums and Stims, you need a stealthboy or 3 in Power Armor but if you get tagged with a legacy laser you're outta there.
---
I know you need specific gear and weapon to PvP. Occasionally I stumble upon a unprepared bloodied player and pull up my vampire ss combat knife and have my way with them.
---
Or a jackhammer arm.
---
Ok kid :D Bloodied is still by far the most powerful build in PTS :D God i love you clueless preteens :D
---
Some details missing here.
---
There's just no way to balance this game to make both PvE and PvP satisfying in the same environment. This is why NW was the best possible solution.
---
My build does more damage than bloodied builds by my calculations so next time im trying to farm at a workshop and a bloodied user comes along i will be doing more damage to them overall because i didnt rely on legendary perks and mostly have qol  effects you can stop denying it mate your build is fucking dead its on equal terms with every other build now only way for this to get better is for them to remove the hp cap and let us gain a little hp when we level based on our endurance *like fallout 4*
---
Yes, so be ready for Earle :-)
---
You know i didn't even consider that.. i look at 76 as outside the lore but obviously I'm wrong. That sucks but you can't change the lore and I get that. Thanks man.
---
Exactly. Was just about to post something similar.
---
IMO, any player interested in making sure they get loot would be wise to shoot her in the air, at least initially and until you cross that \~1,000 HP threshold.
---
I've been in battles, as the Bloodied melee, where I don't get credit because someone with a magic explodey gun melts her in a second or two after touching down.  Faster than I can even commute to the Queen.  It's not fun.
---
Faking debris that can hit you and a lot of different attack types that force you to be intentional about the fight vs just shoot till it’s dead.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Double check you actually joined the event.
---
It happened to me last night, I was there quite a bit early because I was making supper, jumped on the drums, came back at the hour but the event hadnt started yet it seemed.
---
Was wondering wtf and checked the map, the Public event icon for the Cookout was showing on the map, I was still on the drums, but not actually in the event.
---
Quickly fast traveled to the event via the map and just managed to load in time to get rewards.
---
Normally I get there 5 mins before and set up, this time I was there 20-25 mins before, so not sure if it was a one time bug or what.
---
Lots of farming is done by large corporations, and this sort of equipment would boost their productivity.  Dandy Boy Apple corporation could have been on the cutting edge of this research, especially considering the war time contracts they were awarded to package food for the troops.
---
Yeah rifleman lag behind. If you switch to commando it's got better dps, and a minimum of perk changes. Though eats more ammo
---
I don't mind a little pvp every now and then, it's a great way to get the heart pumpin' but getting one shot feels bad man. I also forgot to mention that this person one shot me while I wasn't even engaged in pvp. Literally slap killed me. Then when I tried to at least regain my honor, he ended up doing it again. This was after he put my junk in his survival tent.
---
Me to breh
---
It's the exact same one PC got last week as far as I know. I don't think they've done anything different for consoles.
---
It's all the same day, man.
---
1) Playing without VATS is playing at a handicap
---
2) It’s broken outside of VATS too
---
You don’t have to write that is all, if you just don’t type anything we know that automatically
---
I'm all for this but I'm usually 1 pound away from over weight. I'm a hoarder. Trade off would be if you're in the middle of fighting and you're over weight from the legendaries. Trade off I'll gladly take tho.
---
Half the time the legendaries vanish on me so having it go to the inventory would help. Camera trick doesn't work all the time IMO.
---
Sounds like you didn't have pacifist on and accidentally tagged someone who likes to PvP.
---
That's why I don't expect anything to change, this is more of a rant because I know nothing will happen.
---
This douchebag is just a preteen troll :D ignore him
---
I can go to pretty much every other gaming subreddit, and hear the same thing about said game. So your point is? And who's Y'all, never met him or her before...
---
Only low IQ person here, is you who thinks trolling on a subreddit somehow makes him cool irl. Keep copy pasting your google searched comments though!
---
No it's just maintenance for the new event 
---
Grahm and Chally will be there waiting for you as normal  once maintainace is finished.
---
My Xbox controller always auto shuts off and it kicks me from the game whenever I try and AFK
---
We're you at a workshop?
---
I mean I don’t play the game to have the best build, it’s the feeling of being in power armour that I care about also I finished the season pass 3 weeks early with the build I have and when the rebalance comes out we can get more xp anyway
---
No he's exactly right I already responded to someone about this below but basically I didn't want to sell them that cheap but  really needed the stash space. I wanted to do something nice and wasn't too mad about selling them cheap hoping I could help a low-level player, someone who missed faschnaut, or someone looking to finish their collection. So you can't blame me for being a little upset at someone wiping out my collection in one go just to try a screw over people who don't think they could have found them for way cheaper.
---
Force of habit...
---
20th(1), 21st(2), 22nd(3), 23rd(4), 24th(5), 25th(6), 26(7)... Technically speaking.
---
What do you want to know?
---
Best comment I have read today.
---
It’ll probably be a great build if we ever get loadouts and they can be switched easily
---
It's already been found via dataminers that they don't.
---
The best part about going afk on the drums is you can at least maneuver the camera around. Then if theres low turnout you can hop in and start stamping out fires and killing animals, since those seem to add more to the progress bar after its gone live.
---
Im 21 tard i literally tested your bloodied build which you love to suck it off my build overall was quicker to kill enemies since most bloodied users do not use semi auto weps which means a higher base damage which means a better multiplier for damage while my build is mostly semi autos,  the only thing i see is a desparate tryhard tryonh to convince himself that the build is immortal i wouldve prefered if they removed bloodied and junkies builds which would be the next step and no not with the leg weps approach either just remove their code entirely,  im sitting here looking at my screen rn as my friend who went a fully optimized bloodied build while i had my normal build infact im 1 shoting things now
---
Like I said I'm not doing this to be cool or are you that slow?
---
Not really considering the most upvotes for this reddit is probably at most 1000. Where MW or any other series has 20-40x that. Just saying. Fallouts a dead broken game with low iq fan boys.
---
Gotta give em 10 points for immersion, thats for sure.
---
u/ladydevann
---
Lol definitely
---
A surprise attack by a Mirelurk King already does that.
---
As soon as it takes more time to kill an enemy, it is objectively harder. (because you need to stay aware longer, you need to avoids other NPC, you need more ammo etc...)  It's just how it is.
---
Note: \*harder\* doesnt mean \*impossible\*. The game is still easy. But a little less easy
---
However daily ops are a good challenge. In their current state, you need to be prepared. I like this, but I expect a lot of whine on reddit if it's stay that way, especially if they found the original daily challenge hard. Oh my, this will be a rant festival ! ;)
---
Unclaimed, I even saw the slap damage happened. Then when I spawned somewhere else, same deal.
---
I thought they got vertibirds in/shortly after Fallout 2 when the protagonist got them the plans?
---
Ok, but why you want intelligence on your helmet ?
---
Vampires is being affected but non-directly. As the nerfs hit all damage calculations not just weapon prefixes. Meaning weapon related damage perks, bloody mess, adrenaline, tenderizer, chems..
---
[https://updatecrazy.com/fallout-76-update-1-42-patch-notes/](https://updatecrazy.com/fallout-76-update-1-42-patch-notes/)
---
Should have a straw hat on the helmet, a piece of hay in the re-breather and should ha e a pair of blue overalls painted on the body lol Yeah would be a neat idea. Maybe a bonus to tame animals if your wearing it.
---
1.276 gb for ps4
---
Have it bound specially so random pages fall out of the book as you flip through it.
---
They are instance... find some players who don't use that stuff play with them and enjoy.
---
This too im bout to start rolling in fucking caps especially with that new ammo factory legendary perk,
---
It’s painfully slow when you have enough notes to buy the full set and the mods and you need to wait to cash them in 20 at a time
---
Bettt
---
Right? Hasn't seemed to actually feel like my toon is sick.
---
Ah, yes - with the change in damage it would decrease the Vampire effect - luckily, I rely on Vamp only with very high ROF heavy weapons, where the change would be negligible.
---
I play PVP because I like to smack people inside the Fallout universe lol
---
Brother, I can't wait for loadouts... Seriously in need. I thoroughly enjoy the game still but its a pain in the ass swapping perks around for maybe some crafting or even completely changing it for fighting etc.
---
Just for that little more if I can have that in power armour and have fun then that’s fine by me
---
I would have just taken whatever I needed, not waited in line.
---
It's absolutely broken in game. I'm primarily stealth and I'll get stuck in danger a lot. Stays with fast travel and such sometimes as well.
---
Then what was the point in delaying it?
---
At night on xbox one they were packed the first day. Every day since there were less and less players doing it, even if they were in parties on the server. On day 4 even I tired out and wouldn't bother going to one unless someone else was there, which was rare. Usually when I started one 2+ people showed up though, but yeah people are already over it. I have enough treasury notes for the next month.
---
But the time will run out:/
---
So, they aren’t part of the weeklies, so OP is wrong about it being every 3-4 days. 
---
But there is a building weekly that has five tasks, one of which is ‘Build a generator, light or power connector (20)’. 
---
If they’re building connectors instead of light, just to complete the challenge, then they’re doing it wrong. 
---
But they are technically correct that building connectors is an option in one of the challenges.
---
Ahahahaha you are 14 tops :D Keep dreaming kid :D And btw, if you were 21, which you are not, that would make it even more sad as you act like a 14 year old :D
---
Nerf on damage usually doesn’t get reached when you have a full suit of PA and perks. The people who reach that cap will usually one-two shot you tho lol
---
Why do you consider 76 as outside the lore? I am just wondering.
---
First off ...how ? If you didn't shot or melee him back you can not engage in PvP 
---
Unless it's different if you don't have pacifist mode enabled ??
---
That's still more than a few years in the future, if that's the case.
---
Yet you are still here TRYING to troll a "dead game"? Says something about your iq, don't it?  Subreddit is just a minority of every game, you can't judge a games playerbase on a subreddit, but surely you would know that with your HIGH IQ right?  Seems to me, you are just trying to be cool once again, by hopping on the hate wagon, just because someone else says so.
---
How do you install that?
---
Massively discounted? Modules are 50 scrip. It requires 2 to craft a weapon. That's 100 scrip. How is that massively discounted? 
---
If you do a 100 scrip Purveyor weapon roll, you are guaranteed at least a 3 star weapon that if it's total shit (more than likely) you can cash in for 40 scrip. You use your 2 modules to craft a weapon, it has a high likelihood of being not only total shit, but also a 1 or 2 star peice of total shit that can only be scrapped for 5 or 15 scrip. 
---
How again are modules massively discounted? Include them in the sale, it's the decent thing to do.
---
Good luck. Better have someone aggro Earl and someone clearing the wendigos before you all get swarmed. Unless there’s legacies or magic weapons, Earl is going to take you a whole lot of bullets. Ultimately have fun!
---
Okay, I'll check it out
---
I will say this is canon
---
"damn assaultrons" 
---
I think we can all agree if the game was made entirely of assaultrons it would be impossible to plau
---
Sweet thanks for the reply!
---
You're not  it in there by yourself, unless only 9 turn up and you're last in ...
---
I like how Overwatch does it, xp for playing, which goes towards loot boxes and one loot box a day for playing a game, with a few coins a game after that.
---
Yes pleeeease
---
Someone's mad, I'm laughing. So I guess I got what I wanted.
---
i love 76 even with its issues but fallout is a single player game not pvp. i like buying (and selling) from other people and have seen some very cool bases as well as some epic fails at them but that is where the social aspect ends. 
---
any pvp challenge ALWAYS provoked by somebody 2x your lvl (requirement?) so pointless...
---
I launched my first one a few days ago too. Right as I was putting in the code, there was an alert that someone else had launched one too... my friend fast travelled to the SBQ fight to let me know when everyone had finished so I could then launch mine lol
---
I feel you, I have my build based around full PVP and PVE potential but if somebody knows how to cheese that’s kinda it lol. A railway rifle with VATS perks will destroy you 100%, and there’s nothing you can do because other guns don’t work in VATS, and VATS will always beat free aim.
---
I realized this of course after I sold my JFFR railway.....
---
My bloodied magic Gauss minigun is wating to find out..
---
"Over 2 hours early?"
---
Lol. Yup.
---
I've had this bug since launch. Ps4 and happened recently on my Xbox one s. 
---
Happened to me with the cryptid event all the time on my ps4 pro, annoying as heck.
---
Whenever I'm planning to be near Vault 76 or thereabouts, I grab an extra disease cure, some stims and healing salves, and craft a low-level weapon with some sweet mods.  I direct-message a lowbie and tell them to meet me at 76 for a care package.  If they meet me I'll drop it for them.
---
If they are *pointless* to you, then don’t do them. 
---
It’s like the Mr Fuzzy Token dailies at Camden Park.  If you don’t want to do them, then don’t do them.
---
You’re not being forced to do these challenges. Play how you want to play.
---
that sentence never ended 😂
---
To be fair, I'd rather do this DMV quest than go to the DMV IRL. 
---
It took me two hours once to exchange defective/damaged plates. Feral ghouls are more pleasant than the receptionist's attitude.
---
Only thought the only fans mention was enough, no?
---
Is this also the damage nerf patch?
---
This 100% even kind enough to return flux.
---
From the perspective of a full health junkie's heavy PA/shotgunner/stealth sniper hybrid build:
---
It's only a bullet sponge if you're the only one hitting it. I've never experienced this personally, but apparently some have run into instances where 7 out of the 8 players in the event ignore Earl entirely and just farm Wendigos for 20 minutes. So, yes, if that happens to you, and no one wants to help you kill Earl (assuming you don't have a magic weapon or a legacy weapon of a certain variety) he is a big ol' sponge.
---
And if that does happen, well, stop trying to kill Earl because you'll just be wasting ammo. May as well farm screws and acid with the everyone else in there. 
---
Even if you have a full team of full health players, you'll be fine as long as they all shoot the boss's face and/or vocal sac a lot. Should take about seven minutes, maybe 10 if you've got a bunch of hodgepodge builds. If it takes longer than that, someone wasn't killing Wendigos...
---
That'll melt him, my TSE minigun makes short work of him, magic effects on fast fire weapons patched out on PTS now though...
---
The only way that's possible is if you're an assassin's build, I can't come close to touching them even at my strongest. Which is one of the reasons I don't even mess with pvp. I tried to defend my workshop from a player the other day only because he was 200 levels under me and I had just powered up the fc processor, took him all of half a second to melt me into oblivion after I did 0 damage to him/her lol.
---
I never studied business, but I'm most certain if you make your game the least enjoyable experience as possible to the point where players just quit, that's the best way to not earn money with it.
---
No, you are being downvoted as you are an idiot talking about stuff you don't have any understanding about.
---
Excellent friend there. Nothing worse than getting to the finish line and being gazumped. Lol.
---
[I've already started my own](https://i.imgur.com/2J3Pi8R.png)
---
to answer you you don't get the perk immediately once you reach its level requirements reaching the requirements means it now has a chance of popping up in perk packs you can either keep leveling and hope you get it soon or hit level 50 and manually pick it when you level up again
---
Yeah that's actually a super important part to the story lol that never happens
---
Yeah I guess I shouldn’t have said “shortly after” but IMO you don’t see the Brotherhood in Fallout 3 use any planes because they’re an off shoot of the brotherhood, not a main branch. They had to steal them from the Enclave.
---
If you were to see the main Brotherhood, Fallout 3 era, they probably would have had l vertibirds because of the schematics they got from the enclave.
---
Had a dozen or so of them chasing me around, which I can survive thanks to Reactive Plates. So anyway, I pulled out my two shot Fatman and got a bit over 2000 exp. Good times.
---
Adds rads, but also causes the dreaded "simp" effect. Causes reduced all special except endurance, and suddenly are fast traveled to all fights to intervene.
---
Splitter is broken on the non legendary plasma Gatlings....
---
What's the wall issue?
---
All up in it :D
---
Honestly, the game isn't hard and at that point in time I'd rather have saved my caps for fast traveling.
---
I don't actively pvp in this game and I don't think I ever will but I would appreciate the tip. Perhaps I'll use it for another character or perhaps someone else may get better use off of it. I mainly do heavy guns. As for the person he had a explosive heavy, possibly a .50 cal?
---
Do you mean that the challenge is actually a Challenge?
---
lol right. I've seen one tunnel in the Cranberry Bog on the spiral stairs around the broken monorail pillars before.
---
More time to kill, doesn't make it harder.. Just slightly more time consuming, you can still sit in a doorway or rooftop to avoid most enemies, or sneak and get bonus damage. If they wanted to make it harder, they would need to introduce new combat mechanics, not just up the health on enemies.
---
Daily Ops are the only challenging content, but give it time and people adjust to that and it becomes just as easy. Only thing I reckon people will rant about is when their build is useless for a certain Daily Op, which means they would have to respec.. Which Bethesda seems to have hate for as there is no easy way to respec.
---
I'll give you the Daily Ops part, just because of builds being rendered useless. Everything else will be just as easy as before.
---
This. 
---
I've had it happen once, months ago in a VERY laggy server. Two friends had it happening all day yesterday, both public and private servers.
---
A lot of streamers are using a different method.
---
Do not run at the end ! Stay inside the cave and farm all the screws you can
---
Get teleported to outside after timer runs out.
---
The cursed weapon is now a auto drop and is not tied to the last box anymore.
---
So if you don't mind missing our on a little ore and caps, screws are way more valuble and Angry turtle was getting around 300 screws per run. 
---
Another option.
---
Patch 21 removed the ability to change a wall from a door to a solid wall and back again. This should reverse that change.
---
I did... spoiler it wasn't good.
---
In my opinion level 50 is where it starts to get a little better. I didn't enjoy the beginning grind, however my second character (changed consoles) it's way more enjoyable starting off knowing stuff.
---
When I left ps4 I was level 545 and would still get killed if I wasn't careful. Plus it depends on your build/perks, that can minimize a lot of incoming damage. Same goes for PvP. Level don't mean anything after 50 imo. Just would come down too your build/perks and guns.
---
I don't know. That's how they used to do updates in the long long ago though. PC first, consoles a few days to a week later.
---
Yes because you are the only one that will have that perk :D idiot :D And who the hell needs caps? :D You started a month ago? :D "rolling in caps" xDD
---
Have a nice daaay.
---
"Draw me like one of your French abominations"
---
I don't see where I was mad in that comment. So I guess I was correct, you indeed do have a low iq and are a terrible troll if you think I was mad.
---
that's normal.
---
And you'll still feel that way for a while, b/c now you will be dealing with more difficult critters, etc.
---
At 235, I still feel that way occasionally, even though I now better (most of the time :)  )
---
That site is fake. I've lost count how many times I've said that. Search for Fallout 76 update 1.43 and they'll have something up already (yes, this applies to all games). Shady site is shady. Every patch says stability etc.
---
Get " magic" weapons ..problem solved.
---
Oh ok. Thank you.
---
and i am still waiting for a fixer skin... .
---
That's what I said, I said you can stay and loot the Wendigos lol
---
So what you’re saying, is that people will go through all the trouble of running a silo, launching a nuke to trigger a boss fight, and not fight the boss?!?
---
I honestly don't know, I'll check later.  But when I respawned to get my loot he blasted me without me having fired a shot, the event was over and he was just standing there.
---
The legendary run is fun, but waaaaaay too long. I'm at level 90 and I can't wait to get it over and done with. I missed a few days grinds here and there, and I was actually anxious over the thought that I might not finish the season!! A game should not make you feel like that, at least not over a grind for a small amount of desirable rewards. I'm not sure if I will bother with season 2, awards look meh. But a change up like op mentions could defo improve the experience.
---
Think Sept 10ish
---
Still no fix for the other main quests I see.
---
They're enabling Colossal Problem for you
---
Time to... eat it.
---
Hell, if you shoot me, I normally unload a clip of gamma, I never bother with your bag though.
---
Literally the only things you need to bring scorchbeasts down is a shotgun and Level 3 Enforcer. Limb damage or Explosive helps a ton. If you are strong unarmed, you should be able to kill it while it is downed.
---
I’m pretty sure I have over 2000 script worth of weapons and armors all reduced weight in my stash. Takes over half of the weight, and the rest are bulk junks and items I sell/display. I don’t even loot 2 star enemies anymore.
---
I haven't felt this enlightened since the last time I met the Mothman.
---
So I'm supposed to be grateful?
---
Xbox? I'm in
---
Upvoted for visibility. The stealth is broken. A lot of times it is burrowing mobs. Other times it is just random detection.
---
I'm crying tears, youre a prime target.
---
12 noon on the 20th to 12 noon on the 21st (24 hours or 1 day)
---
12 noon on the 20th to 12 noon on the 26th ***(144 hours or 6 days)***
---
You don’t get to count the 20th or the 26th as full days, because the event isn’t available for the full day. You couldn’t do Meat Week events at 8am ET on 8/20 and you won’t be able to do them at 3pm ET on the 26th.
---
Dates versus days.
---
I was thinking the same. I did this quest over the weekend and both my wife and I had flash to IRL DMV. Had us cracking up especially the "have a nice day" every freakn' time lol.
---
Hah if its not up your alley then thats cool. As sacrilegious as it is, I'm an herbivore and that recipe is pretty great. +60 max hp, 90 hp regen and 30% food? Sign me up hah its really easy to craft too so that makes it doubly appealing
---
Every hour at the top of the hour, Grahm’s event starts. Every 15 minutes between that, 3 Primal Cuts starts in three different places on the map.
---
It’s not rocket science. Just pay attention.
---
In order for another player to kill you would require you to have pacifist mode switched off and to have hit that player. Pvp is very avoidable in this game so, as I said, there are some details missing from this story and fooling nobody.
---
Actually, yes.  You should never go to a queen fight without pacifist on if you dont want to PvP especially as a heavy gunner who is spraying alot.  That other player was extremely kind to return your Flux to you.
---
It's a short hop from vertibots to vertibirds, though. I wouldn't put it past some scribe to figure out how to modify one for passengers.
---
Automagically! Prestodigitilization, yer a wizard Davenport!
---
I don't know if that was your typo, but it's freaking great.
---
You aren't even done leveling up, slow your roll.
---
Definitely a lot of luck. I got a BE handmade from a ghoul a little while back. I'm not bloodied, so I may trade for something I want.
---
Grinding and luck for the secret service armor for me. I got good vanguard pieces right away on 2, and spent dozens of modules for the next 2. Probably 30 more rolls and I still don't have a vanguard right arm. In that time I think I've gotten 3 decent unyielding in case I want to play bloodied. But it is definitely a grind.
---
I honestly think the settler power armor from the bundle really kind of fits that look. It's pretty cool I think on an excavator it would look even better .
---
Well think about it, if you’re willing to buy something from another player, why buy the crappy stuff when you can ask for the high quality stuff. 
---
Sure the player might not want to sell it, buts there’s the chance that it might be available for purchase. Maybe at max caps or something.
---
I might wrong. Just remember someone getting in to a long conversation with me about the differences between the GL and UGL and what causes the beam to change colour and which could have the BoS skin.
---
At least in fallout we can take out the frustration on some ghouls
---
Well with how colossal problem went I’d assume it’ll be released on pc on 23 or 24 but it will work on 25 for console.
---
The only disease you DONT get is Flap Limb.
---
Tbh if you support the BoS you have to be a complete simpleton to begin with.
---
I agree on this. But there's some timers tied on a certain time, and then others at 20h. It's lame.
---
I'd like everything with a 20h cooldown honestly.
---
Sort by new, homes
---
Ye imo they should nerf things like serenpidity too because with unyielding or other types of armor you can just  have it proc 10x and not take damage the only way you kill a bloodied is if you get the drop on them  the only better way bethestda could nerf bloodied is make it to where rad damage doesnt count towards a lowered hp bar 
---
Oh that and the fact that admantium skeleton is prob one of the most broken perks pvp wise
---
They mentioned something during quakcon about looking into player build and swapping builds easily.
---
I hope that means i can swap between being a sneak rifle today and a heavy gunner tomorrow and then back easily.
---
Because now with legendary perks coming moving special points puts you at a disadvantage.
---
I prefer my challenges to be engaging. Fast traveling around the map to known bobble head spawns is not engaging, especially when each loading screen could result in the game freezing. I appreciate the sass though
---
Lol, probably
---
I love how everyone in these comments are like "dupers dupers dupers."  No, some people actually just get things on their own.
---
Secret Service Armor: Pocketed and Deep Pocketed Mods for Secret Service Armor limbs can now correctly be purchased from Regs using Gold Bullion.
---
That's what I was waiting for !
---
Really? Magic weapons got patched?
---
Colossal Problem and a few hotfixes. It interfered with my morning plans too and now I'm finished until the weekend. However, because we're actually getting a new event I'll let it slide.
---
'Dumb post of the day" is proving to have some fierce competition today but we may have a winner.
---
For some reason my brain thought it would run through today. 
---
Alas, I was close to a level for the daily. 500 extra points lost, like tears in the rain.
---
What platform are you on?  I'm missing the peppered, but I think I have an extra spicy or salt. I'm on PS4.
---
For real
---
I want the ultra light mods instead
---
Gaming on laptop make sure ur plugged in. 
---
Also in power management set it to max performance or whatever its called.  I forget.
---
He also kept dying. Meaning he kept seeking revenge.
---
Yeah, I had a lvl 143 buy all my level 5 and 10 legendaries for the whole 20 scrip they were worth to him. Grr.
---
Lololol I'll still show up with my magic shot gun and minigun and melt everything before you can get a hit on anything, also not to mention my legacies that I will be pulling up to events, sorry buddy but you still will not be standing a chance with your Nocturnal Combat rifle with 40 bash damage
---
Copying the update file is always a colossal problem! 😀
---
Something to help find their bodies would be nice. And something to stop them FALLING THROUGH THE GROUND. 
---
I swear since the hotfix to release collosal half my legendaries clip through the ground.
---
So many times I’ve sold items to vendors for way less than they’re worth because I’m tired of trading out all my bartering, crafting, and building perks. Plus would love to have a heavy gunner PA and unarmed melee build on the same char. Their specials are so close to one another
---
I would expect a game made for pvp to do pvp much, much better.
---
Shotguns still work in VATS when using armour to trigger.
---
Armour doesn't trigger the magic on fast fire weapons anymore.
---
The Instigating, Junkies and Stalker prefix still works I believe.
---
Depends how you are getting it.
---
They didn't return flux, they gave what they had to you. 
---
If you die after the event, any stable flux you had disappears. 
---
Bethesda probably did this to stop people from murdering others to get their flux.
---
That's very nice. You know some level 400 is going to come along and grab everything though!
---
Hmmmm, zoom in if you didnt notice 🙈
---
How about when you spend 60 caps to go across the map for a horde of creatures that spawn underground!
---
You ain't kidding! 😂
---
It took me about a month or two of trading to trade up to a legacy I really wanted and could be proud of. You could do it in a week if you already have a good armory.
---
Lol, imagine needing to use your imagination to win arguments. You're by far the worst troll I have seen on Reddit, thanks for the laugh kid.
---
To get more xp... while being in pa.  Pa is actually good for heavy weapons, imo better then unyielding because of the aa effect.  Also not everybody plays bloodied.  Unyielding isn't a very good armor choice for a junkies build.
---
Don't forget the drills.
---
And a luck perk named Super Duper that at rank 3 you get a 30% chance to get double every time you craft something
---
Got it.  I'm pretty sure I didn't shoot him though.  The event was completely over when he blasted me.  Twice.  Second time while I was there just to retrieve my stuff.
---
As for pacifist, I don't know, I haven't checked that setting since I started the game.  If the default setting is for it to be off then it's off.
---
I will turn it to pacifist when I log in later today.
---
Also, I didn't receive any wanted tag during the whole incident.
---
Same here man, despite all of the issues and criticism fallout has received I still play it, this one event that happened to me won't stop me from playing it. I'm fine with pvp but at the moment I won't find it here in 76.
---
3 minute download 1 hour copying
---
[Definitely NSFW](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2076515554)
---
That would dramatically increase the number of test cases for every update.  Given how many bugs get through as it is, I'll pass.
---
Bash damage trigger patched too.
---
Can I do it with blooded PA? I’m very worried about being killed so easily
---
Yes sir
---
Thanks. I am also EST. My ps4 name is vaylon1
---
Pretty sure they would've just gone to automation
---
This I agree on.
---
Did somebody say encrypted? No? Just me then.
---
and they literally aren’t my guy
---
they’re treated like armor because you wear it
---
Thanks. That will come in handy
---
Lol nice I was gonna offer my private server too but looks like y'all got it
---
Alright, hopefully I'll feel powerful soon.
---
It should be a +2
---
This wouldn't be such an issue with a well maintained codebase. Unfortunately the ageing Creation Engine with two decades of spaghetti code and extremely rushed netcode bolted on make this impossible. The technical debt on this engine is so high at this point that there doesn't seem to be any practical or reasonable way to fix it.
---
Thanks. Will try to get there today.
---
Yeah, it's happened once or twice.  This is why we can't have nice things.
---
Oh, alright.
---
Spread your wings and fly. Spread your legs and die.
---
Lol, wake me when it’s done! Zzz...
---
Thanks! That's what figured but couldn't find anything definitive. I appreciate it.
---
It looks like she just gave birth to a baby that does not belong to her scorchbeast husband.. he is gonna be so pissed.
---
Pretty sure there is nothing that can compete with it but not everyone wants to follow the so called “meta” with the bloodied/uny build
---
But...but...butt!
---
Oh god! So my bloodied bashing gauss minigun is not considered as magic now?
---
Maybe that word has a less malevolent meaning in some cultures? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It’s called berry mentats
---
Plug it in, then rubber band the right thumbstick while in 3rd person, or when playing an instrument
---
But is the pie creamy? 🤔
---
I'd be up for buying the oil, on Xbox too!
---
Not leaving much to pay for , kinda get the whole enchilada with the first picture
---
You'll feel that way at least until level 120.  
---
At that point you'll have a lot of the perk cards you need for stuff to start felling easier.  Also, by then you should have at least one good legendary weapon for your build and decent armour, assuming that you play all the way to that level instead of taking some of the level up shortcuts.
---
Though, to be fair, level 120 isn't what it used to be.  What I mean is that with Public team play you can get up to 4x XP, so it takes less playing hours to get there.  And it's playing time, number of legendary drops, etc. that influences how quickly you get the items that you need for the game to feel easier.
---
Think I'm done with the internet for a bit
---
I am currently level 56. I've been pushing against the wall since about 40.
---
Is it the 26th? I just remember them saying it will run for 7 days
---
Try looking for this year?
---
Same. I don’t how to get my rubber band around it the right way. I got it working the other day, but now it just doesnt
---
And we're not even to lunch yet!
---
It’s 2020... but it’s most likely the consoles finally getting colossal problem
---
Okay, keep playing catcher for the BoS and Beth.
---
Cause the other helmet mods suck so he would rather have the extra do per kill
---
Nope, makes a huge difference :-)
---
Just make sure to put it on because you probably didn't see it but a stray bullet probably barely clipped the other player.  It happens.  The first time it happened to me was around your level as well.  It's a learning experience.
---

I did pioneer scout whitonan nothing
---
How’s about the vats 33?
---
I guess I missed that part. I always do lights because they are super cheap.
---
One hour copying?  Wouldn’t that be nice.
---
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
---
If/when patch 22 comes out, assuming they don't change it again (unlikely)
---
Absolutely. Of all the legendary stuff I own, I've bought or traded for maybe 15% of it. And none of that is god roll stuff. My main weapon is an instigating 33 vats lever I traded for. Great weapon for me, hardly top tier. I traded some kind of above average mini gun for it that I got from the purveyor. The others are the same way.  Could I have a duped item?  Maybe, but I doubt it.
---
Jep. The arms description says use them in tandem. But i checked.  Both arms don't do anything. Maybe carryweight? I check later. But torso gives the 4x yield
---
Everyone complained about the event getting delayed now they’re mad that they can’t do the meat week for a couple hours. I much rather have the new event and fixes then play two more meat events to get another chally outfit. I guess I’m not as worried being I was able to trade a fixer plan just one plan not a gun for a tenderizer plan and next event I got the pepper mod. If I don’t get the other two mods by Thursday oh well. But seriously guys don’t you want the new event and new rewards?
---
Have you updated your game in the last hour?
---
I don’t get it. I see a lot of posts about this, how do you people get scammed? You sell an item for the amount of caps you want and if the person wants to buy it, they have to pay in order to get the item requested. 
---
Same way if you want to purchase something from another player, you have to accept and pay the caps they asked in order for you receive the item you requested. 
---
Unless you guys are talking about trading “item a” for “item b” 
---
And the other player refuses to trade their item and keeps both of them. Well, if that’s the case, there’s a subreddit for people that do that. You both give the item to said person, he/she holds it for you to make sure the transaction is done properly. Once the transaction is done, that player will give the item to the person it belongs to. Everybody leaves happy, nobody gets scammed. 
---
The people that serve as the “middle” person is obviously a person that has verified history of successfully helping other players trade without any incident. People that can be trusted because otherwise I believe their account gets deleted or banned. 
---
I do agree there should be a two factor. And if both parties don’t click accept, the trade won’t work. 
---
But until then, if you don’t want to be scammed, and until Bethesda does something about it, do yourself a favor and look into that subreddit.
---
Seems to me this highlights at least 2 things. First storing those weapons to scrip later is only a solution if you find yourself in a position where you don't want to play later and these allow you to skip playing without "missing out" on your daily allowance of rewards. Second what is the point of 1 and 2 star enemies if their loot is at best a hindrance.
---
Pacifist mode...
---
Also were you wanted by chance?
---
That’s what it showed on the ITV. I could be wrong, though. I’m hoping they decide to extend it since there were issues with the events, according to the reports here. It would be a nice gesture.
---
I haven't been able to test that I'm afraid
---
It's a good point. I guess personally I prefer to buy things - even if it's for 1c - so I feel like I earned it. But I know I'm weird and free may be the way to go.
---
Worst side quest in the game, in my opinion.
---
I love this. 🤣
---
Oh my 😍
---
Oh, you're gonna die. Bloodied maybe will make it happen faster, but everyone dies.
---
Even if you trade for stuff, you got something of roughly equal value.
---
Thanks for your info anyway
---
Good idea!
---
wrong.  I only went to get my scrap bag and he killed me again.  The third time was after he got the thumbs down from the level 1000+ player, that's when he gave me the flux.
---
Why are you guys so quick to think I'm BS-ing?
---
We all die a little more inside the more of the internet we see.
---
And encrypted was same exploded and disappeared
---
All this crying with AFKers at these events but there all praised when AFKing for NW awards.
---
Yeah, following the main quest right out of the gate is generally a bad idea, in my opinion. but I enjoy grinding characters.
---
Welcome, it's a real bitch, Legacy weapons still tear arse...for now
---
How do you feel about free stuff? If I had a few level 1 armors and level 5 weapons? Would you want them?
---
As a non-american a glimpse into your way of life was pretty comical. For a country full of guns y’all seem to settle for some bullshit
---
Def gonna flap to that.
---
Brahmin milk is good for rad managenent
---
Lol armor has different levels, conditions and effects. 99% of outfits have none of that, they are the exact same, yet still counted separately in inventory just like armor. I wonder why that is 🤔 to make them harder to d00p man.
---
Same. I’ve got a preset blueprint that covers all of that challenge except for the crops/water sources part. Take me about 5 seconds to place that down and maybe 10 more to plant the crops/water. All in a workshop so it doesn’t use my own scrap. 
---
The other day, I completed the entire day’s challenges in less than five minutes.  
---
To me, the challenge is ‘how efficient can I get’ with these tasks. 
---
OP complaining that they are pointless is, well, pointless. You don’t have to do the challenges if you don’t want. So why complain about them?
---
Ah okay
---
This is so, so bad
---
It was almost instant. So much so that I left to make food for my 4 daughters and came back to it being done minutes after signing in

Join a public team, sleep every hour or so to get the 5% sleep bonus, make cranberry cobbler for an extra 5%. A team with 4 will give you some good bonuses, do events especially meat week this week every hour. Hit Camden park, it has enemies from 6 to 32 typically and an area where I level up all my low levels initially, then anywhere on the left side of the map. 
---
Level 40 doesn't sound too high, depending on your level. Grab some raider PA if you under 25 for a strength boost, even an empty frame will give you +10 strength
---
I want those lights more than anything else right now.  They were my favorite kind of lights to place in FO4, and they would look nice going down the overhang of my shops.
---
I always explain it to myself like this

eggs are comparable to air vehicles lock-on weaponry countermeasures (homing missiles and stuff like that)

You can have those jammers or flares,right? To fool the projectiles

Well the other option is that band or crackheads responsible for 76 at bethesda had a wild night while thinking about giant frogs in the game

Literally this, why are people downvoting you?  Currently just multiple everything together, soon, add all multipliers, then multiply by base damage
---
Anything under lv 50 is still
---
Just the tutorial
---
I was a few 100 xp from 1000 score bonus, bummer, but hey it’s Bethesda, we all agreed to partake in this shit show and should expect some of it
---
I have had 3 since I learnt the plan 1 from mumbles and 2 from the cookout as a reward so yes they are out there, sadly I got prefixes only good enough for the scrip machine.
---
Apparently. Again, haven't seen this myself but judging my how often it gets posted on reddit, at least a dozen people have had this happen. What's likely is that those players didn't actually launch the nuke. Remember, the percentage of the player base on any platform that has actually launched a nuke is quite likely very, very, very small. 
---
Think of it like Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble, or Encryptid. No one pays attention and they just kill the mobs. Except, unlike Encryptid, you can actually just shoot the boss from moment one.
---
This is why some players get really good at soloing any of the three Biomes for Project Paradise, and tanking three Pylons for Encryptid while also drawing aggro from the Imposter. The events would quite often fail if they didn't.
---
I agree, or at least equal or better value to me. I've got a furious plasma I use for the queen. As a rifleman player, most heavy guns I get are less than useful. But that lever was a game changer for me.
---
Lets start with how close we are to the capital wasteland and it still is suppose to take the BOS over a hundread years to get there.
---
So... the DMV simulation was pretty accurate then.
---
No ounce of prevention?
---
“Effects of alcohol doubled”
---
and yet they’re treated like armor, with the armor identifier in their metadata, because you wear them like armor. 
---
no one cares if you dupe outfits, it’s an outfit, and you can still dupe them.
---
The more you see the atom splash screen, the more fancy things you'll buy for real money.  That may not apply to you or me, but it does to a lot of people.
---
They did. On their website.
---
Because they maintenance isn't planned around your personal schedule. It's Monday morning in Bethesda's timezone, when else are they to shut the game down for updates? You got 2 more days to play it.
---
I would rather try and get a tenderizer plan then have colossal problem they shouldn't drop a patch during an event.  It's not fair to people who don't have all day to play the event.
---
They want compensation for the game being down for maintenance.
---
Totally
---
Why? Because there's no easy-to-access general current price guide for anyone to, like, go look up general current prices of things. Who's spending their time price-checking virtual values in imaginary currency of fake stuff in a video game? Takes long enough just to put the crap in a vendor.
---
Lol yes! It was clever and fairly true to real life, so I gotta give them that much.
---
Needs of the many....
---
I've been blank full last 3 scorchbeast queens that I have helped to kill
---
Confirmed, just bought and put this on.
---
81% ?! Holy shit. The gatling laser already was a peashooter.
---
I believe I have everything except for the grill master hat.
---
Yeah…
---
Thanks man that was very informative.
---
Is colossal problem only a temporary event?
---
Decent gun would be nice what you using? Also what platform you on? If you're on PC av got a nice Quad Explosive Combat Rifle lvl 20
---
oh what a shame
---
Well guess the ppl that are spending real money on legacies or gave everything for are going to be real salty after this
---
Yup,  watch innovs video.  It’s pathetic,  even she had to admit it was unusable.
---
I'll sell you a perfectly preserved pie for 30000 caps
---
I don't find it too bad, just use marsupial and jump up to the second floor above the bots. Snipe from up there until your number is called.
---
Meh, never been a fan of energy weapons, I prefer my shotgun and handmade.
---
So you’re asking for an LMG nerf too
---
Cant really do the public team but didnt realise about the sleep and cobbler bonus, that will definitely help so cheers. Will do, mite explore up that side first. Not really looking for PA just yet, pistols and explosives for now.
---
They probably dont need script and they are taking up space in there inventory
---
Holy shit... I had no clue. I always wondered why people were up there during the countdown; figured they were just claiming the spots or goofing off. I've wasted so much time!
---
And i just got a b25 gatling laser😞
---
Thanks. So far my luck perks haven't been very lucky. I got my first luck perk last night.
---
I have done as many side quests along the way as i can.
---
I don’t spend money and have a collection of plasmas myself.  Not really even the point,  went right over your head bud.  This means ALL Gatling plasmas will be basically useless.  Because legacies are so broken they may actually be OK but I can’t confirm.
---
That's pretty much the point, no?
---
Have a nice day.
---
Last year it was a zoo at almost every prime cuts event that popped up. I've had to solo the one in the bog a few times so far this year. I'd rather do that than have someone kill the behemoth in 3 seconds, though.
---
For as much as I now want to defined it for the sweet nourishing salt.. I'm pretty sure it's just a bug and they'll get rebalanced before it goes live. After all it's a Public **TEST** Server. Nothing in it is written in stone.
---
It doesn't "literally prevent you from playing the game", it doesn't shut you off after you've hit your scrip and bullion limits for the day, stop being a drama llama. it prevents you from consuming the gear content in a week and then bitching that there's nothing to do.
---
Biggest mmo in history - world of warcraft. For years the end game content was 1 raid thst took you 3 hours per week, and then about 20 daily quests. 
---
This is an industry standard, because it works. If it didn't we wouldn't be having this conversation.
---
Wonder how much/if the gauss mini is effected.
---
So...?
---
xD. I mean why should a weapon from 1942 be better?
---
I love how you brag about being part of the problem in the middle of a compliant.
---
My gamer tag is ash lemonjello
---
:(

It went to far, like 60 percent of the quest would have been enough

Very ;)

VATS always goes straight to the sky for Scorched Earth. I can see the HUGE flying bat. What I need help with is the radroach or mirelurk spawn ruining my life. They should add a radius affect first to base VATS on proximity.
---
Now that is a perfectly preserved pie 😏
---
Exactly

The sounds of Bikini Bottom.
---
As long as you're not AFKing doing nothing (since there's actually stuff to do at this one), I honestly could not give less of a Raw Fertilizer.
---
You may not be here, but you're still helping. That's all that matters to me.
---
I'm sort of curious - although it varies between weapons and armor, what do people think a passable rate is for caps-to-stars if you're just selling junk Scrip?  I've basically been going by 50 per star, and every now and then, someone comes and cleans me out.  But they sit for a *long* time.
---
Freemy
---
If true, I'd rather they just delete all legacy energy and buff the remaining energy weapons.
---
Love free stuff. At this point I can't seem to be able to keep enough of anything. Besides, it seems like every time I try and do a farming run of stuff. Someone else has already cleaned out areas.
---
He can't kill you unless you seek revenge my dude.
---
Would those happen to be Explosive Legacies?
---
Because THOSE are what are getting rendered useless, not Energy weapons in general.
---
What I keep telling myself...it’s just the test server...but idk numbers like that seem highly suspect.
---
I sell excess to the robot vendors....just too many legendaries to count.
---
Frustrating as all heck. Pulled all my hair out. Am now bald and sad.
---
12 out 10. Immersion never been so deep.
---
I have a vampire's gauss minigun, same feeling, but the event is just too bullet intensive.
---
Not as much,  should be the best energy heavy by far now.
---
I keep saying there should be a barter system where you can trade items.
---
Hey bud I know what you meant I’m also saying that ppl with legacies will be even more salty about the nerf. I have two bloodied gat plasma and one gat laser so I know they will be useless. You just assumed I’m some dumb kid and completely missed the subject.
---
Mine go for 20 caps because why not , scrip limits are a joke legendary drops are 98% trash and nobody needs another god roll wooden leg
---
To be fair this is kind of a bizarre situation where they actually delayed meat week by 2 days so they could introduce the problematic event first. Then they delayed the problem and eventually decided to reintroduce it in the middle of the event that was delayed so it didn't distract from it before. It just works.
---
&gt; but idk numbers like that seem highly suspect.
---
Please elaborate
---
A step in the right direction. It’s selfish and unfair to melt legendaries and bosses in seconds, preventing the great majority of players from getting rewards. People forget this isn’t a single player game. 
---
It’s forced co-op so try to be respectful of the other players. All of those magic weapons are broken, sure, but so are the bloodied heavy builds and they’re leveling the playing field a tiny bit.
---
PC.  I'm gonna keep doing the event and try to trade for them afterward if I don't get them.  Appreciate it though
---
lol well I don't need you to teach me why i should use a PA with heavy weapons. Don't you see i said i have a PA ? And Junkie or not, if you are looking to max your xp gain...an Unyielding armor set is still your best option. At the end of the day it's...do you have enough dmg to allow yourself to be out of your PA. It's all i'm trying to say, but he's done with the his season pass.
---
Anyone know how long servers will be down?
---
From the testing I saw it was non legacies,  my collection is all legacies but it doesn’t matter,  I knew this day would come,  cry babies that don’t want to grind to trade for stuff like that would get there way eventually.
---
Anybody know how long?
---
Don’t worry as long as people keep bragging how magic those guns are, nerf will come fast and hard.
---
Good point . I see what you mean, I know I was heated with this last delay. I guess I’m just caught up in the event finally going live
---
Oooo a blueprint is smart!
---
Will not happen.. it’s an international game with players from Multiple time zones playing on the same servers.
---
I've seen this and I think our current theory is that it has to do with meleeing Earle.  For us, Earle has buried himself in the floor, sometimes completely, sometimes you can see the top of his heads.  Other times, he's floating up in the ceiling and all you see are his feet.  He swapped between the two constantly, like he lost all concept of what ground level was.
---
If this happens, once you get his attention, it's good to just kind of back off and let him come forward.  The issue did seem to correct itself once he was able to move around a bit.
---
Gotta move that weight out your inventory ASAP
---
Oh I've finally beat the tutorial then.
---
10-20 per scrip
---
It's being reported that energy damage is bugged right now and not receiving buffs from any source. Don't jump to conclusions thinking this was intentional.
---
Ohh, should've guessed that tbh
---
Yeah if you don’t mind
---
My first time playing, I basically stealthed around alot.
---
For the hospital part, there is an entrance right next to the stairwell that leads down to where you need to go. I think this is the back entrance, so hug the building till you find a single door, I think it's on the east side of the building, but not 100% sure.
---
I still don't get why the lowered the number of objectives and introduced major quest blocking bugs in "Ounce of Prevention" I never found any of them difficult or confusing when I did it on my first character. Even the greg's shop part.
---
I would agree if most weren't at a weight of 2 or less.
---
Oh alright.
---
Sure! Just updating atm
---
It's my least favorite, if only because it's very difficult for a lot of people who aren't me. 
---
I've heard there's a guaranteed spawn for one on top of the entrance building to Blackwater Mine. The building is a metal half-cylinder, and the bobblehead sits right on top. I believe you need Marsupial, or to approach from the cliffs above, to get to it.
---
So far that spawn hasn't failed me, but for newbies and solo players who don't have access to the knowledge and friends I have, it is by far one of the hardest challenges.
---
Wait it has an update ?
---
Yeah but the salt I have doesn’t emanate from that,  well sorta but not just because of that,  it’s just the lack of love Bethesda has for energy weapons in general.  Ya know...In a fallout game.
---
PVP it's completely crap in this game. Most of PVPers are 12y childs that think they can grief you until you blow them with a legacy. Great way to gather free junk. Miss old days, specially if you carry a sentinel set 😂
---
Agree, Level 390, play for hours every day.  Will probably quit for good when this happens.  I view it as BSG trying to get rid of long time high level players and just bring in noobs who they think will generate a bigger cash flow.  It is essentially stealing all the weapons and armor that long time players have accumulated without actually taking them.  Just making them next to useless.  (Are they doing this because they cann't control duping and hybrid weapon creation so, they make all weapons weak?)
---
2 weight or less though
---
Lmao i never said what gun i was using also i habe a magic shotgun too instigating explosive so you have permission to suck it also from what i heard magic miniguns were patched please cry more
---
In a way, it depends on your level and what area you can play in.  
---
Each of the challenges can be considered part of "normal" game play.
---
The trick for BGS is to make all the challenges completable by any level player.
---
  Capture a workshop is relatively easy for a L100, but for a L10, maybe not so much.  An L200 may know static spawn points for bubblegum and bobbles, that L10 likely does not.
---
I liked hitting the old the old trifecta - level up on deathclaw island while wearing a clown suit and armed with an axe....  or even the quad - kill a deathclaw + the level up .... still required timing and the right equipment.   Something a lower level player may not have.
---
Won't argue the build X at camp thing, I'm at max budget, so have to do the same as you - scrap, build, scrap, build.
---
kill 10 scorched?  low levels can do that at Morgantown airport, so can high levels - or we can hit up a fissure and loot some ultracite.
---
Probably end up with a scorchbeast (or two), the requisite number of scorched, and maybe a legendary while we are at it.  And a chunk of XP toward the 10K repeatable.
---
Arguably, high levels have a much easier time with the 10k XP, as we can kill things good for 200+ XP per - 20 minutes doing the WS cottage loop does it for me, and likely, I get 3 legendaries in the process.  
---
No low level area or event do that.  (True, leader of the pack for mutliple legendaries, but not the XP)
---
TL;DR: The skill/difficulty balance on dailys is likely designed so the lowest level player can successfully complete it.  High level players have more options for some challenges.
---
Not every comment on your post is gonna be directed towards you.
---
Don’t forget the people complaining in the server because they couldn’t get damage.  Yeah no those nerfs need to come ASAP lmao.
---
I only use excavator PA for the extra carry weight at the moment, and yes I’m on xbox
---
OMG THAT HAPPENED FRIEND AND IT WAS HIS 3RD ATTEMPT
---
Bloody hell, be glad we got rid of crafting 25 types of booze and just snap your fucking photo smh
---
Inventory weight is very precious lol
---
I would stop focusing on any quests and do more exploration. Find where you can manage and where you can. Stick to the manageable regions for the time being. Level up, find new gear, etc.
---
It’s Bethesda,  they lie regularly and say things are unintentional on a monthly basis...
---
I took a bunch of "before" pics to see the difference  once the patch is released on consoles. At the moment my Bloodied gauss mini (named it "Queen's Bane) is my highest dps with 407 damage per shot.
---
Any good shotguns? I’m using an instigating 25% fire rate pump at the moment I kind of want something else too
---
Well it’s actually adding the colossal problem event
---
Lol you think Monday morning is peak hours?
---
You can play again in a couple hours calm down.
---
I'm full health build, using Quad Gauss on PTS I lost about 100 damage, the nerf to boosts from the shotgunner cards is what did that. So if you use any cards/perks to increase damage, at all, then you are 100% also being nerfed I'm afraid :-)
---
Innovsurvivalist has a video on YouTube detailing some of the nerfs, check there man.
---
I horde all my guns haha I’m so terrible at it. I’ve just been giving my lower level legendaries away to new players
---
It's just odd. I don't know why they didn't just announce that Earle would arrive on consoles after Meat Week ends instead. Meat week kind of makes servers run like crap by themselves since there is some much pollution at the sites of primal cuts, all those piles of items that fell out of unlooted corpses could not possibly make the new event run smoother. 
---
Looking forward to trying the new event finally but just wish I wasn't totally overencumbered right now like meat week always does to me. It's like having Thanksgiving dinner everyday for a week, so much damn weight.
---
Just finished and the servers are still down, great
---
Nah I'm blind I was a whole set of commas off. We're suppose to be talking millions
---
And its very early for alot of people.....
---
It's around 40% ish
---
They don’t buff anything just because players complained, but will quickly nerf anything, from scrap drops to weapon powers, if enough players brag about them. Nerfing is their #1 priority, way above any bug fixes.
---
How long will the update take ?
---
Oh I get what you Mean. I remember when I first got one in 76. Well let’s just say it was a big let down
---
I wish the green mist from a legendary spawn had a longer duration and was persistent on death. The effect is already there, let’s just make it longer and persistent. For my last request of course remove the Bloody Mess animation from legendary enemies.
---
Maybe you should dupe them next time theres a glitch xD
---
It was a daily challenge that expired at 9, “level up” it will be expired by the time the maintenance comes up, I will still level up today but that will be a new daily challenge for half the score.
---
So yes, I’m losing out on that 1000, I’m mostly cool with it though, unlocked the fireflies which is all I really wanted, after that point there are minor things but nothing worth that grind.
---
But dropping damage that much basically makes in unplayable for solo players not everyone likes to run a team.
---
Most of the time it’s a couple hours 4 max
---
Ikr. Not missing much with this event anyway. Mediocre rewards at best.
---
I think the BOS coming to 76 will not stay BOS.  I think that is how they will explain it.  With little infomration so far I think they left the West Coast over a year ago when the 76 BOS was still around trying to beat the Scorth.  They lost comms along the way will arrive here and split form the Maxon BOS and there for the BOS history will not include them.
---
&gt; mid morning hours being peak of players
---
Highly doubt that. Especially on a Monday.
---
&gt; Bethesda is a joke
---
For what, having normal working hours? It's Monday morning, when else are they supposed to work? Or should they accommodate your preferences at their expense to patch it at your preferred time?
---
Fucking chally!!!!
---
One solution could be to instead of swapping the special stat, you could "add" one instead. Adding means you could swap to that special without having to level up, like a free swap. Now, lets say I want rifle build and then I regret and want back to shotgun, I have to do additional leveling. This way I only needed to take the special points once and thats it.
---
Magic Weapons = Not Fine (Need fixed) Bloodied Heavies = Needed a light nerf (25% seems fair). No one ever didn’t get loot because I used my bffr Gatling Laser.
---
Helping people get scrip. A wasteland hero.
---
Filthy but not casual.
---
The first day of meat week, it would disconnect me from the server if I was on the drum when the event started, so I was a spinning guy in the middle 😔 
---
But now it seems to have stopped and I’m drumming all day
---
Nah the guy laughing at bloodied builds getting nerfed, but doesn't realize everything is getting nerfed is the winner.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ifpuoh/with_these_nerfs_coming_with_one_wasteland_i_have/
---
Players are all over the world my friend ..there is no good time for an update.
---
Isn't that how Covid started?
---
Two things do this with perfect consistency, for me:
---
* The mobs at Primal Cuts have some type of perfect vision. From the moment they spawn until they die, I am unavoidably and inescapably in \[DANGER\]. Same goes for the Daily Ops mobs in the PTS (though I assume that's by design).
---
* A burrowing enemy (Mole Rat or Radscorpion, and Mothman too since the mechanic functions similarly)  will have that same perfect vision once it has done its burrowing. Before they burrow they function properly and can be sneak attacked; after they burrow they have perfect vision.
---
Additionally, laggy servers will keep me in or out of stealth longer than they should, and occasionally a passive mob will put me in \[DANGER\]. But those are all inconsistent, and most days I can play for hours with no sign of them.
---
I have seen crappy 3 star legendary weapons for 10 caps and 10 thousand caps......
---
Ok that's not bad
---
"Targeting hud" isn't that bad. It's just that +2 intelligence isn't enough to really see a benificial effect. Personally i just prefer keeping my "Targeting hud" mod and jump out of my PA to take advantage of my Unyielding armor set, if needed.
---
We can live other week without the event.
---
Here is what  it sounds like to me. They know bloodied is OP.  But   a glass cannon build ***has to do more damage*** than  any other build because of the low health.
---
They figured bloodied has to remain the highest damage build in the game, but it also needs a nerf, so the way around it is just to nerf everything along with bloodied. That's... kind of insane.
---
And you say to me what I already know why exactly?
---
No, I wouldn't think any of that. I'm at work right now, this is the perfect time for an update. Bethesda doing things correctly.
---
The system is wrong not the player.
---
It should not be " do x amount of damage " to get rewards.
---
Anyone entering the events should get rewarded and before anyone says " it will increase afkers " so what SQB is going down within a minute so it's not like they are afk for a whole raid.
---
I think so
---
Oh my bad. Since there’s no notifications for the website, I guess I’ll have to make the perfectly reasonable decision to check the website ten times a day. If only there were several social media platforms that they’re supposed to utilize to inform us of these types of things. While I’m grateful that fellow fans have been giving us the news, it shouldn’t be their responsibility
---
I dunno, that's a saturated market.
---
If 11:40am is very early for you man I wish I had your schedule
---
Permanent addition to the game.
---
&gt; ~~We~~
---
We didn't ask you to speak for us.
---
I do not personally afk, but I wholeheartedly thank you for your help in making sure everyone wins at meat week.
---
Most people who work 2nds get on about now and play till its work time.
---
If it was, I totally understand patient zero, then.
---
I'm used to drop stuff on the dead responder close to the vault entrance. Your prices are ok, but i cant see any benefit on selling that stuff to lower players. If you kill a supermutant you will get more caps
---
Ap cost reduction has a max cap
---
Or just play the game...no need to rush
---
Bit soon.
---
Meat Week is over on the 26th, boyo.
---
Maintenance is only activating A Colossal Problem.
---
Some of us have jobs my guy, dont have all day to grind the meat event.
---
I think that right there is why I have never.. Elevator bugged one try, something bugged the first time round... said I would go back, never did...  I have two characters about 150...  It is like meh..  I have never completed the quest to launch encrypted either, it bugs so I say I will get bac, then I don't.  I have like 12 of those cards for each too, lol... When I do get around to it it should be fun.
---
  Now that you are L50, you can use max level weapons and armor.  Will probably be a few more levels before you find them.  You'll likely apply a tweak or two to your build along the way.  In the meantime, you get to play with lot of other new weapons; figure out what works best :)
---
IIRC, I was about L65 when I found what ended up being (and still is) my primary weapon.
---
its not over yet
---
Wishful thinking I'm afraid - Meat Week continues.
---
Flat-earther, that you?
---
I just want the tenderizer plan, but this maintenance is messing all that up I gotta work soon and that's like 10hrs of not being able to grind for it.
---
It’s possible to make an unarmed build with a drill and a box of cornflakes. Just not a great idea....
---
We also get a second meat week. I believe it starts on September 10th.
---
Yo mamma
---
LMAO "some of us have jobs" says the guy at home on Monday morning. 
---
\-Someone who has been at the office since 6 am and works 50+ hours a week.
---
I did some of them but after receiving my fifth moo moo mask and another costume decided to call it a day.
---
I've seen it. I don't know what you mean by:
---
Love this quest. I burst out laughing when J27 or whatever that special ghoul was called comes out when his number is up 🤣
---
Damn. Well at least I have a hair appointment today, that should eat some of it.
---
If it prevents me from progressing, it's pretty much the same.
---
You must not know about different time zones my guy.
---
Nope its 16:45.
---
(not everyone lives in the same timezone you know.)
---
Most people who work normal hours, including Bethesda employees, don't and that is a majority of people who are either working or in school. But yeah, let's make all of us play around YOUR schedule.
---
I guess she went vegetarian. 🤔
---
I think I was 150 when i tried it! 
---
It's honestly not bad. I built my character for shotguns, but I did the nuke with my melee alternative because shotgun shells are expensive to make. It would have been even easier with a team.
---
I've noticed it happens a lot more when I've bloodied myself with rads. Also if it happens then I use a stimpac and try again it always works.... so weird.
---
I know this my guy
---
I check majority of my goods with FED, then if it's worth selling even if it's a few k, I do that. Trade only items I keep for myself when I really want something, I'll have a tradeable item for it🤔
---
He didn’t return flux, he GAVE his flux to OP. What a nice guy 👍
---
There's a joke to be made here about either a Furious or Bloodied bat, but I'll let the reader make it....
---
How does the CSS with Lvl 3 Sneak fare in this?
---
Fully agree! Didn't mean to sound like a smart ass.
---
I fully expected a bunch of office fans.
---
I always thought his name was pronounced Graham. Now I know it's pronounced "Gram".
---
That’s what I do it still auto shuts off
---
Completely disagree.  I’ve had servers where I’m the only one that can do damage and half the 7-8 people are afk and the other half are using pea shooters.  Keep in mind I didn’t even launch the nuke.  The queens health scales to the amount of players.  I want you lower level guys to get loot but honestly don’t bother showing up until you get a decent heavy weapon, are level 50,  and don’t mind putting down some rounds.  Do other events if you don’t meet that criteria.  There are many other events.  It’s supposed to be the endgame boss.
---
We’ve been able to finish it with 3 people, no drums or turning the meat, not sure if it is a glitch
---
SURPRISE!!
---
Who would want it so bad after seeing what it was like on PC?
---
The hive mind
---
They make the update available so you can download it as they are updating the servers, this is actually them doing a solid

This is Fallout 76....  “tears in the rain” is the ONLY feature that just works
---
I was just in the same boat last week, and it seemed to get better once I hit level 30ish.
---
The 20’s are just a poorly-balanced set of levels imo. You 1-hit everything in the Forest, but get wrecked if you venture into the other zones.  
---
I also found out that if there are high level players nearby, the monsters will be high level, too. If I start noticing myself being way out leveled by mobs, I server hop and it usually fixes the problem.
---
Was that when you realized the servers aren't running on your console and need to be updated as well?
---
Touche haha.
---
I actually thought this part of the quest was pretty funny. One of their rare well written ideas in the game. Poor J 47...
---
Someone told me it’s because of the healing factor mutation in combination with being a bloody build.
---
Lol if anyone is salty it's you, who hurt you?
---
The irony is delicious
---
Runs till the 26th doesn't it?
---
Ahh yes you're right it will be addressed on consoles today!
---
They have all been taken down, I was hoping when it redirected me to update the application that during that update. It finally finished and still down
---
Grass could be greener. If Bloodied and Junkies becomes unviable do you honestly believe people who currently use these builds will just stick them out. 
---
Or find the new meta and still come back stronger than the average player. 
---
Basically there will always be a meta and the people who use them will always seek the next newer one out if the current gets nerfed. 
---
Any change just replaces one build for the next and people will always find a way to min/max. If they honestly perfectly balance everything. Then what's the point? Why bother even trying if it's perfectly balanced. 
---
Sea of thieves as an example. Becomes dull and boring and the reward for earning gold seems moot as only cosmetic upgrades doesn't give a sense of accomplishment the same as gaining some form of power. 
---
Balancing is good but honestly don't expect the playing field to be level due to a new meta and min/max setup.
---
Oooooooh, godly.
---
Thanks!  This is what I use. 
---
1x1 shack with doors in each wall and a short stairwell at one of them. One decoration on each interior corner and one on an outside wall. A small generator on top with three Construction Lights (along with four turrets; not needed for the challenge but useful for the defense event) and two lightbulbs inside.  Stack five footlockers in a corner.  
---
The associated costs are very low and usually covered completely by a workshop’s green budget, even without Contractor equipped. 
---
All that’s left for that Weekly is the x10 Crops or Water Sources. I’m still working on a way to get Water Pumps as part of the blueprint, but planting 10 crops is easy enough so I probably won’t worry about it.
---
Congrats , now you can start working on your build and gear set!
---
Like they are testing the waters with players to see how much they can nerf them without a backlash.  Idk anyone who’s been paying attention has seen some of the shady stuff Bethesda has done in this game.  I’m sure you’ve noticed some of it.  Remember how not being able to cripple the SBQ was unintentional and they vowed to fix it.  I think the fight is better now but it just shows how much they talk out there ass.
---
Hope it isn't going to have the damage nerfs included
---
Yes, because the servers aren't all on your console and need to be updated as well?
---
Not sure why ANYONE would give a damn about the mods for it then outside of completion. Never understood that to me, useless completion is pointless completion.
---
Awesome. :)
---
What about the Tesla rifle?
---
Yeah it was well written but annoying at the same time?
---
It happened to me kinda with the baby interloper. It looks like it's posing XD [Image](https://imgur.com/gallery/yqx4Dpx)
---
I suppose, in fairness, that is the only one of those posts specifically today.
---
Relaxe, i feel that you are ready to confront the whole Bloodied build comunity here. Calm down lol !
---
I'm on a "PA Bloodied Heavy Gunner build". Meta build, bloodied build or not, an Unyielding armor set is just too beneficial to be ignored. It may not give you the best defense but it is extremly useful to max the specific special points you are looking for.
---
Do not ignore this armor set bro !
---
Ha! I got it last night at around 2100 hrs PST
---
So, if I got it, surely it won’t be rare. 
---
Everyone be ready!
---
I dont live on the east coast of Merica.   So is not 11:48 here.
---
Any tips for bloody melee builds?
---
Either way you look at it this maintenance is going to screw all the weapons balance and just add more bugs without fixing bugs but go head and bitch like a bunch of girls not everyone has all day to play this game 😂😂😂
---
Why no public team, you get 4x bonus with 4 people, why wouldn't you ? You don't need to do anything with them, they just part of your team, nothing else. You don't have to play with them, you can ignore them. Also a great way to fast travel for free. People just my team just to fast travel to the meat week event and then leave .. it has a lot of great benefits once you learn how to use the team to do stuff. PA you can keep in your back pocket and only weighs 10 lbs. Use it when you need it, jump out of and just keep it on you when you don't.
---
There's alot of ways to incorporate FO76 into the east coast lore without retcon-ing too much.
---
FO3 BoS arrived in the capital wastelands on airships (part of which was discussed in FO: Tactics. But it wouldn't be unimaginable that there were "scouts" sent ahead to identify surviving sites that warrant investigation for technology. So the FO76 hikers who walked across the continent to get to Appalachia could have been the scouts.
---
The vertibirds that Taggarty had were likely military hardware they had access to or salvaged after the war. Not manufactured, just recovered gear. While the plans recovered in FO2 were likely used to manufacture new vertibirds.
---
But who knows, maybe it'll all be retconned or maybe FO76 will be considered not part of the timeline like what happened with FO: Tactics. Though I wouldn't mind some raids against a homicidal robot base full of behemoth bots. Just no scurry bots, hate molerats already, don't need a robot version of them.
---
Check YouTube
---
Remove the complaining posts and rehashed ideas then the sub would be blank.
---
And you do, thinking it's 11:40 am everywhere at the same time?
---
Well its a bad game mode so its hard to find players
---
Yeah, but a 1911 in anything else than .45 is just pure wrong 😂
---
&gt; this maintenance is going to screw all the weapon balance
---
Oh yeah, and you saw that where? In those patch notes that have nothing about weapon damage in this patch? At least educate yourself before resorting to whining and insults. But what else to expect when all there's is to this thread is your personal entitlement...
---
&gt; Add bugs
---
I bet you'd be shocked when you saw that this is a hotfix to fix bugs...
---
Wall and collassus hotfixing at F76's current performance level is like repairing your car's broken tail light but the engine is out of oil. But they already gots our money so it's like they are philanthropists if they fix anything at all. Bye Don 2020!
---
The division.  Shooting cleaners tanks to blow them up.
---
It's understandable why you felt that way.  If people don't like this game that's fine. I Can't bash anyone who reasonably hates or unreasonably hates the game. I personally really enjoy it. And that's just me. Glad your having fun with it! (:
---
I should start doing that, I feel I’m so far behind cap wise. I only have about 1900 caps. I’ve been getting nothing but trash weapons but I’ve been getting lucky recently
---
Actually legacy energy weapons will likely receive a smaller nerf because of the additional explosive damage
---
I was immersed
---
You should try this mission if you're hard of hearing and rely on subtitles. A good 75% of the dialog never pops up in subtitles or they glitch out like world dialogue often does in this game. I still don't know what the quest is, why you have to stand there for so long, or what you're doing. I just keep talking to the robots, ghouls come out, and things happen.
---
I get the gist, I think, which is to start the robots, and then play through the queue. The ghouls are the queue? I'm not sure why there's sometimes just full minutes of standing there and nothing happening though. I suspect the robots are talking out loud and the subtitles aren't appearing, or there's just lots of idle time? I've done this quest 4 times now, still not really sure what it is. I've heard people say it's funny, but Bethesda hates hearing challenged people so I dunno.
---
Easy fix, dont die..../s
---
I am sure I will someday, maybe it is because I always get caught up in dailies or meat week or whatever.. I almost gave up on meat week because the BBQ was totally broken for me .. I went to Reddit and found out it was working for others, did a hard reboot on the Xbox and it started working, mostly, and have kind of enjoyed it... I assume the silo run will be the same 🙂
---
Yeah, but why add another caliber? I have 240k .45 waiting to be used.
---
Fallout 96 isn’t out yet. Still 30 games till that happens.
---
Link?
---
You haven't done a sbq fight yet at 150? You are missing out. Aside from fascnat it is hands down the best way for a server to come together to do something. The improved repair kits and flux you get at the end are invaluable for me. As for your experience with the game I was in the same boat. I hated the idea that fallout was going to be online. Luckily I skipped getting it until wayyy after wastelanders and I got bored and decided to spend the 40$ and just try it. Best money I have spent all year. About to hit 550 hours now.
---
The games been umplayable for 12 hours for me. And when the servers where finally up, i got slammed with an update. I'm locked out of doing all my dailys on the last day of 2x Score.
---
Don't expect Beth to care, the less progress you make with double score, the better for them. Don't bother submitting a ticket.
---
When this game launched I vowed I would never play it.
---
Roll around the launch of Wastelanders and I took a shot at it as I was bored of Destiny 2 and the division 2 
---
As soon as I came out of the vault I fell in love again with Fallout and the community on here and in game has been the cherry on top.
---
Games still full of bugs and I have never had my Xbox crash as much as it does playing Fallout 76 but I am still here !
---
More than the standard drop too, 10 flux. Not 3 that it gives.
---
Yeah there will be a problem alright!
---
Get weapon, kill baddies, get better weapon, kill baddies ... rinse and repeat.  
---
Do events and dailies in low level areas; join public groups that gives extra XP.  
---
At some point it'll get easy.
---
Ummm... Ok?
---
You realise Explosive deals 20% base damage right?? And you can boost with demo expert, but even without, as I said "DPS is about the same" but sure go ahead and use up all your ammo ;)

...and pepperoni rolls
---
I'm not sure if you understand this, but some people out there are legitimately motivated by nothing other than self-interest. This person (foolishly, in my opinion) believes they can sell the masks at 500c/ea. 
---
This person does not care that you put your masks out for people who don't have them. They do not care that you were trying to do a good thing. They do not care that there are people who want the masks but can't afford 500c/ea. All they care about is making more money for themself.
---
Some people are truly selfish, and that is what it is. It may not make sense to you or me, but it's out there.
---
Aw man that sucks I’m sorry that‘a not fair
---
Weapon balance is on PTS currently, no schedule yet to bring it to other servers.
---
Speaking of people talking out their ass
---
It got a noticeable nerf from my understanding as well as like everything else.  Not as hard as the heavies though
---
Compulsively reload this page to get your fix until the update is complete.
---
BGS needs to fix the legacy weapons like they claimed a year ago.  Then the so called market for them will vanish.
---
Grinds my gears that they think invalidating an entire build for certain events makes sense to them. Then on top of it, I _still_ have to go chase down the enemies that allegedly detect me.
---
Servers are back up
---
We’re live
---
Proud owner of the most duped guns in game.  Congrats none the less.
---
It's a bug. Energy weapons aren't getting any damage buffs from perks, effects, etc. I just hope they fix it before it goes live...
---
WW2/cold war era weapons need to be a thing and not ATX skins.
---
And the fact you don't know about this details is funny, watch any Youtuber that dose fallout content and you'll see that the pts are a shit show with the damage output. But idk what I'm talking about.
---
U wouldn't quote me on it but doesn't your teammates getting caught affect your sneak?
---
Also I'd like to point out the USA isnt the universal centre of time. You have players from all over the world. 5PM here in the UK and its down. Someone somewhere will have to be inconvenienced
---
Appreciate the input. Have been playing for a while but never with friends so I do feel like I can’t keep track of all the spawns. This tip will stay at the top of my mind, though. Thanks!
---
Updates finished.
---
You can log on now
---
I am Blooded/Heavy Gunner Build but I normally don't go for full Blooded Effect. I try to keep my Rads at a little over half waypoint. If I need more then I just drink a Glowing Drink you get at West Tech. But don't leave it there. I just don't understand this bug?
---
Do low level events. Especially right now just do the cook out event for some good lower level loot and xp.
---
Is back up now. It’s 2am my time so someone’s gotta be inconvenienced right?
---
Not read any of the million other posts in the last few hours? Or all of the people responding with links, or on Beths Twitter, or on their website, or on their forums or just googling?
---
I'd say watoga transportation hub is a great spot. I often go to that locked room and there's usually one there .
---
&gt;BEthESdA MAKes No UNiquE QuEsts ANyMorE, SO LAZY!
---
&gt;Bethesda makes a unique questline
---
This quest ws good and charming, it doesn't even take that long to get finished. Chill lol
---
Yeah, kinda daunting but I think I'll be fine.
---
Servers just came on as you posted
---
It's just a blank page for me
---
At least my head isn’t in mine.
---
Overworld subtitle text, when you're not engaged in dialog but someone is talking, has had iffy support in this engine going back to Oblivion at least. I'm not surprised at this point, but I just figured in a decade's time or so maybe they'd hire at least one deaf person that would stand up and say "Yo, this is some bullshit"
---
Processing... Processing... Sounds like the have the motivation of a DMV employee..
---
The quest was totally fine until servers disconnected me twice, making me do the entire quest 3 freaking times. That was like almost an hour and a half wasted 😂
---
Although I got all but one before the big dupe wave, the point is these things were unobtainable wasnt it?
---
No clue. No one has mentioned anything about it.
---
About 1GB.
---
Does it drop anything you can cook?
---
Ah, a YouTuber... Only one who clearly doesn't know about this or pretty much anything about the state of these changes here is you. This patch does not include the damage changes. Those changes are on the PTS and planned for September after they are finalized. Which every YouTuber says clearly. You'd know all that if you bothered to read, as suggested above or watched a single video you refer to here...
---
 So no, you don't know what you're talking about and here's the [patch notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2uZWTGKr44jRhx8wuCaGU8/fallout-76-hotfix-notes-august-18-2020)  for **today's** patch so you finally have an opportunity to ease some of that ignorance since you don't even know what's a proper resource to educate yourself with before speaking.
---
And can you please tell me how any of that actually benefits Bethesda?
---
You living in the future?
---
traded for a B/E GP this morning too :/.
---
Wait, they didn't ask your permission?
---
...and since it maxes at 20....WHY the hell does the slider to all the way to 500? I think Bethesda devs are trolling us.
---
Your guess is as good as mine, let’s find out! Excited.
---
I have a junkies combat shotgun that is pretty dope.also recently got a vampire's combat shotgun as well.maybe we can meet and I'll pass one on to you
---
Thx man!!
---
Fanny packs.
---
I haven't really tried it, next time my team8 is on I'll test it for you and get back with the results
---
Deathclaws also have a tendency to death flop into hilariously seductive positions. I have a picture of one in my gallery, and I laugh every time it pops up on the loading screen
---
Thanks Fallout god
---
🤣🤣
---
Why would they need my permission? I'm generally wondering aren't they meant to be quick fixes.
---
I've got IRL death threats and dox threats for not engaging with a PvP streamer. 
---
If you don't spend a majority of your effort in this game optimising your build, don't even bother engaging in it.
---
Id love to see an adventure mode that has no legendary effects on weapons or armour, no serums. Might make for a fun experience.
---
&gt;Playing without VATS is playing at a handicap
---
lol
---
They should really consult you next time they are planning an update.
---
I just lol'd for real 😂
---
Yup the copy part took an hour to do...im about to hop on. lets see what this wendingos got
---
no worries dude. it takes time to get a full feel for it. i'm level 189 and still trying to figure things out
---
I know nothing about consoles, but perhaps it's some sort of system setting?
---
Still copying on ps4.
---
Someone get OP 50,000 atoms for the pain and suffering
---
I doubt it will, if it does today I quit
---
Another one i will classify as " cool story bro " , if  you had pacifist on there is no way to initiate pvp
---
I never fight the Queen at full Blooded Health. You die way too fast. Plus she just rads you up as you fight her.
---
Das hot
---
Maybe a 50cal or an LMG, I can stand in front of a BE 50cal and not die but my main character is Pvp based, so PVE doesn't stand a chance. That's due to the Dense + Fireproof and Sent Assassin armor set. Not much point in speccing for pvp these days unless you already have but if you ever want to know a few things then PM me. One thing I would say is try and get a railway rifle or legacy laser, that way if some turd tries to take a workshop you can pummel him/her on vats as these two weapons still work in vats. Not sure if you're aware but vats doesn't work in pvp at the moment, it's broke. For some reason though legacy weapons and railways still work... Power Armor will melt with a good railway in or out of vats, the laser to. Nice to have on hand.
---
I'd like to be able to buy more vault steel w/o hopping ... even at full price
---
There are far too many people who think Meat Week went from Monday to Monday.
---
Yeah, but it's been fun so far so I have hope for the next 50 levels
---
Just remember to not log on until a few mins past reset time or you might auto complete your SCORE for the day.
---
I'm in the market for deathclaw pus.. hmm
---
I'm going to see if I can finally buy deep pocketed for my SS armor.
---
Yeah, thats the one, primal cuts screws sneak up so badly, you know the savage divide one, I went in the little cluster of trees with full shadowed combat while it was at night with escape artist and sneak 3 and still got detected.
---
This one was after fast traveling a few times and it kept following me. This was the best photo of them all though.
---
I love it when a thread comes together to shit on a shitpost.
---
Weird, try opening in imgur instead of a chrome tab
---
No, but I love OP's spirit.
---
No Way! On my second day playing, a higher level player helped me out with some enemies and then gave me alot of gifts. They gave me 4 or 5 Faschnacht masks, including the Sun and the Skull. The two of us were changing to different outfits just for the fun of it.
---
I had no idea they can be that valuable. Then again I'm still a fairly new player with no experience of the past events lol.
---
Have to think about how that market is though.
---
AA is only viable in pvp if you use it with low health, or you crit which you can't currently as vats is broke in pvp. Only legacy energy weapons and railways work in vats in pvp.
---
Wait you don't pronounce Graham as gram?
---
Take that upvote
---
We need stealth armor or PA for rads ?
---
The damage nerf is making it tougher on everyone, not just meta builds. Yes the meta builds got hit harder, but they're still going to have an easier time than a non-meta/unoptimized build post nerf.  So if you were a "normal player" struggling before, you're gonna struggle even harder.
---
Better having 1,9k than having 19k and someone buys 20k worth of goods from you and you loose 11k cuz cap limit 🤔😭😂
---
Can't wait to try out the new content (deep pocketed ss limbs)
---
Ah I see, that must be why adults start to bald.
---
I don't know, they skipped 72 other games last time
---
To make the game more grindy,   we still have repair kits and scrap kits in the atomic shop after all.  Not to mention anyway to indirectly hurt legacies and the market around them is in Bethesda’s interest as long as they don’t make it so obvious.  The average Joe may not want to grind for probably weeks for a decent weapon when they can go online and buy an Exp Laser for 10$.  It’s an uncomfortable truth for sure.
---
RobCo built the Mr Farmhands, Building PA, if they even had the knowledge, would be cannibalizing their own business.
---
If you’re going to try to be witty, at least get the simple math correct.
---
No difference, it has been halted until further notice
---
I always use the “combat” pipboy interface instead of looking at the pip screen. It’s much clearer, loads faster, and it also changes most of the computer screens in the game which makes them easier to read also.
---
Jesus that would hurt, I don’t think I’ve ever had more than 3k caps at one time hahaha.
---
I never ran into that bug but i grinded hard Finished the Season right before meat week
---
Where you edit every other worn item.
---
https://updatecrazy.com/fallout-76-update-1-42-patch-notes/
---
Yeah, I've heard people have been wanting that for a while, I hope they finnaly deliver their promise
---
In my world, it is the complete opposite. I find 10mm laying around everywhere, but I'm looking for shotty.  And I find lead but need aluminum.
---
I’m hoping radiation tumble has prepared me for this. Stealth armor and rad shield, popping the occasional diluted rad away.
---
Thats what i want as well. Hope both are good to go
---
I run a bloody stealth commando, I've been fine so far. Died once from the behemoth sniping me across the map with a rock at the cranberry bog event, and twice from the mirelurk queen in the Mire. Other than that it's smooth sailing.
---
Is bloodied really a glass cannon build though? With mutations, legendary armor effects, perks like serendipity and nerd rage and mods like emergency protocols I see teammates in my group who run bloodied in the middle of 10+ enemies during a queen fight and just seemingly tank everything with no problem
---
Umm... Ok?
---
You realize firrerate is a 25% increase after all damage increases, so it’s like way more and the dps isn’t even close.  But sure go ahead and complain about ammo, I have hundreds of thousands of steel and lead.
---
I dont think its too bad anymore but I havent run it a ton. Only things that bug me are going straight to respawn without being able to be revived, respawn timer getting long as shit and respawning outside the mine if you die at the same time as Earle.
---
All seem to be more of an issue with me dying alot though lol.
---
I play full health sneak Rifleman, so compared to you I have essentially a BB gun. I've begun hunting for a Vampire's version of my current rifle, so that I won't have to eat so many stims. Since my Instigating gun isn't doing great damage anyway with no sneak, the loss of one extra bullet per enemy is not much.
---
I'm expecting to go Commando and hopefully have a Vampire's gun in time for Daily Ops to release for real. That way I should still be dealing *some* damage and not stimming myself 100% of the time.
---
It’s funny how people are like oh he said it was stolen so downvote
---
You know you can switch the style of your pipboy with 'V'?
---
For the ini I found "fScanlineFrequency=200" under [Pipboy] , try setting it to 0
---
Edit: alternatively "bPipboyDisableFX=1"
---
It seems to be something do with with bloodied builds + healing factor mutation
---
I showed you my sonic emitter... plz respond.
---
Totally agree, I've never made a melee build because I've always gone commando. I'd like to do exactly as you said, hopefully not to long before we get them.
---
For an average Joe smoe it is.   Not many people use outside markets to hunt and trade for them.   And there have been many dupe waves.  Not just the previous one.
---
I read this last Thursday and have been a "banger/spinner" ever since. I get there as early as I can and bang the fuck out of those drums or spin the hell out of the meat just to do my part!
---
Been saying it for a long time. This game needs a proper balance. A BALANCE not repeated nerfs. 
---
Bloodied whatever builds are fine, they are a glass cannon. I have ran it (more lately due to getting more XP for Legendary Run) but I always go back to my high health build. 
---
Legacies are fine. In fact they need to come back and become obtainable again. Why limit what a player can use in a open world do what you want game? 
---
A proper balance is what is needed. Make all of the creature specific weapons do 60% more damage to their respective creatures instead of 30%, this would mean people can choose between carrying creature guns or using bloodied/junkies. Nocturnal is powerful but the time is all messed up, make it 12 hours instead of 7. Berserkers could use a buff, lets face it 0 armor is glass cannon too treat it that way. Mutants definitely needs a buff, make it like junkies or bump it to 35%. These changes would give more options to people instead of further restraining what is useful and it would also help even the market. People wouldn't only be chasing 2 or 3 prefixes because people could get good damage regardless. 
---
Finally, make it so as long as you join an event you get rewards from the boss(es), or the boss(es) is(are) lootable. Any ads that are legendary you still need to hit. Yes 1 shotting happens but it isnt just 1 build doing it. 
---
For the love of Atom quit trying to balance a game that is 2 years old by nerfing anything good. Focus on bringing what isnt good up to being viable and bring out new content like more nukable locations that spawn area specific bosses. The end game has been forced into chasing specific gear, leave it alone but bring other gear up and make more end game activities even level lock a few. Yes it will infuriate some but it gives players something to look forward too once they reach 100 or 150.
---
Colossal is live?
---
That is true, and I agree with you
---
Did you masterbat?
---
I'm level 96, I think I have to play until at least Saturday to complete it.
---
would have liked to have seen Smoked Wendingo Fingers or something for it
---
I want that abilty to stun/scare people to use on other creatures
---
I slacked off at the beginning so it's probably gonna take me another 2 weeks.
---
definitely skipping next season.
---
Why exactly does this happen?
---
I got error downloading messages, so I had to restart the download again this morning.  70Gb...
---
I always recommend a Chinese Stealth suit. I stack some additional sneaks perks on top for overkill. Assualtrons stay visible if they do not detect the player. Usually I like to do it with 2 people. Me as the stealth to clear out a room first. Then a second Heavy Power armor. I’m also they type that likes to have one of us keep the damaged mainframe cores so we can repair them later. Then when we hit the silo we don’t have to spend time on that portion. I just run through with a flamer to destroy the mainframe.
---
Try doing it in a pandemic. All I gotta do is renew my license, don't have a take a test or anything, but I must go in and show my current address by taking a current utility bill in and showing it to the clerk. Are you kidding me? Do these guys not have email or faxes. I went there on the hottest day of the year and the line. Was down the block. I gave up after 15 minutes when I moved two six foot apart spaces. Would have died from sunburn if I waited any longer
---
Straight Covid.
---
It's the equivalent of "don't like it so don't use it".
---
That's not a fix and it's game design flaw. You cant handicap yourself if others don't do it.
---
I gotta do that too. 
---
It still messes with me to this day lol.
---
Thanks for the tip! Never heard of this spawn so will have to check it out once my game is updated
---
It might be hard to get cranberry cobbler but the meat stew from the feed the people event gives you 5% xp for an hour as does the path to enlightenment event when you commune with mothman at the end, these two combined with sleep and a public team will help
---
That one too haha. 
---
But to be fair that’s a weird word lol.
---
is it? I can't login it says they are still working on it
---
Same
---
No rads in the event itself only when you leave
---
Yep about to start colossal problem which is active now
---
So that's why I wasn't hitting him. We were both low health, but as you said vats isn't currently working and I was vating(?) him.
---
Perfectly preserved.
---
I don't hate Bloodied. I hate Unyielding and how I have to play as bloodied and wear Unyielding so I can actually perform functions that don't require me to continuously respec my perk cards and can still level up at a respectable pace. Keep bloodied and junkies and all damage as is and maybe remove the totally excessive synergy Unyielding gives bloodied.
---
Thanks!  I'm growing up so fast
---
But Soooo tasty!
---
Do we spawn into the mine?
---
See, it was cos of the echo.
---
I got atleast two before I get on... Have fun..
---
If you want to hear the current shop song without the hollow distortion, [here it is.](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=UtwEAZEKk7w&amp;list=RDAMVMUtwEAZEKk7w)
---
I've tried it with:
---
 - Escape Artist
---
 - Sneak 3
---
 - 5 shadowed pieces of "Harder to detect while sneaking" Armor
---
 - The Fixer equipped
---
They still see me the instant they spawn, and do so until they die. It's impossible to hide from them even with everything maxed out.
---
For what it's worth, a piece of Sneak armor is equivalent to 1 rank in the Sneak perk. The Fixer adds 3 pieces' worth of the Shadowed bonus. So that's functionally 8 ranks in Sneak, 8 pieces of Shadowed armor, and Escape Artist.
---
that's weird, I'll reset my console. thanks
---
hey, remember those other games that dont dont disappoint you? maybe go play them so you can enjoy your brief time on this planet!  😀👍
---
For a fella in the UK, I went bald when selling my flat, after the Land Registry, a department of the UK government, that keeps a registry of all land ownership and sales, lost my lease.
---
Two fecking years it took to resolve. Two fecking years of being stuck in a flat I just wanted to sell in London, paying London rates to live, when all I wanted to do was move to Scotland with my Aberdonian missus... Two fecking years...
---
I looked like an '80s rockstar at the start. Now I look like a walking turtle wax advert...
---
*Cries in shiny head*
---
If you fast travel to the event then yes you spawn in the mine itself.
---
I played pretty casually and only missed maybe 3 or 4 days in total but didn't kill myself trying. Makes me feel better about next season. No need to rush after all
---
Apparently:)
---
I’ll friend you when I’m online, not quite sure what time but if you’re there I’ll invite you and we’ll get you hooked up on some ammo.
---
Only started after I got healing factor/went bloodied so that makes sense to me
---
LOL Playing this morning was so stress-free now that the Run is done.
---
Agree with most of that.  All very good ideas except I wouldn’t put mutants quite so high,  I’m thinking 4% per mutation stacking 5 times so it’s balanced with two shot. Also I think you should have to tag an enemy to get loot,  I don’t want to promote AFK players like nuclear winter does.
---
Ok , thanks for the info
---
This is the best instancing of this idea so far. I would love something like Clean Appalachia in where we get super mutant themed items!
---
Those are categorized under misc though, OP says in your inventory/stash they're all listed as recipes
---
Yes, fallout 4, a single player game with no implications for other players.
---
Damn, it is pretty ridiculous, mole rats are the most annoying enemy as they just pester you and now screw up sneak
---
Good to hear. 
---
How many people with decent builds do you need for it go well? Now I'm just worried being stuck with a bunch of low levels.
---
I’m sure the Swiss feel the same on some English words ;)
---
I’ve since changed the wooden shack to a Slocums joe, and in the kitchen there is a keypad door that leads down into the secret base, I’m satisfied but I could do better with the nuka cola door.
---
Speaking of bobbles, I’m looking for mele and perception, anybody selling ? Xbox, please.
---
A glass cannon if that glass was not glass at all, and infact solid concrete
---
You sure? If you get the weeklies done in a day plus Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday dailies I think it'll be enough. Might not even have to do Thursdays
---
U r missing a very simple solution to ur stash issue...
---
U do know, u can make a total of 5 characters per account. Just make a mule, a low level toon to hold stuff. U now have an additional 800lb stash, 30k cap hold and 1000 scrip, PER MULE. There is no such thing as not enough room, u just dont the full knowledge of the game mechanics
---
Sorry that happened to you
---
Ps4 takes forever to copy
---
I logged off right now before the reset and i was like wait, what am I doing? Bethesda has conditioned me
---
event happens every hour. just go to the next one.
---
Level 150? Damn that seems quick; granted I only play a few hours a day on weekends. You really must being putting some hours in.
---
Shut up, old man
---
That’s why I always put a weapon skin on my 25 25 handmades. No way no how that’s leaving my inventory. Now if we could just add the dark matter skin to the fixer, people would stop asking for my junkie or bloodied fixer.
---
I also laugh when they ask for a rare outfit like the travelling leather coat which you’re currently wearing. Yes, I’ll strip in front of you for money...
---
What?? I can fast travel while being knifed lol
---
Yeah, the mole rats are a pain, they just screw up my stealth
---
Yep, some ppl are still unaware. I used to run AA with low health and it kicked ass, especially against PA. Now I use a JE laser and B2525 handmade. 
---
Mod you handmade to true barrel and stabilised stock, add in ground pounder and your hip fire will become super accurate, then at a distance use burst fire aiming down sites, stay crouched for that bonus damage and you should fare abit better. You'll need better armor and weapons for a seasoned pvper though.
---
I read that line and was like "How the FUCK"
---
ohhhhkaaaaayyy
---
Base damage 100.
---
5 rounds per second
---
DPS = 500
---
Explosive damage added to base damage 120
---
DPS = 600
---
Base damage 100
---
6.25 rounds per second
---
DPS = 625
---
Oh but what's that you have 20 in the mag and need to reload? Well while your FFR is reloading, the E is still churning out the damage. So it has much better sustained DPS too over multiple magazines (less time reloading vs time firing)... Enjoy the lead and steeeeeeeeel!!
---
No doubt! Being from Denmark I find a lot of foreign words weird lol.
---
But Danish is also really weird language
---
I would say a close second is knowing I don't have to worry about playing NW for the time being.
---
Lmao
---
This makes no sense.  Masks take up .1 on stash space.  Theyre meaningless in the big picture of managing stash space
---
we could see vertibots be shot down and reinstated by the BoS later in fractured steel if their presence does become as important as previous game titles. Since a lot of the living existed before the war, there’s got to be at least a few people who understand exactly how a vertibird works, even if they wouldn’t know how to create new ones.
---
Was thinking of making 1 to sell all my pics of paige, meg, and a few sexy saw mills
---
It's not too bad. He's hits hard, but his scream that sends me running gives me stim pack breaks, when he doesn't hit me. I find it hard to stay up when the Wendigo overwhelm me, though. 
---
I don't know what to recommend if you're bloodied, but I swapped out my instigating deathclaw for a vampiric dagger and my survival rate shot up. Only died 4 times.
---
Last time I went in, I took a magic shotgun, and only died 3 times.
---
So you are saying you literally don’t know anything else to do besides play Fallout 76?
---
Absolutely. Although I will have to jump back on when they update the rewards
---
Yep. And perhaps more importantly, this doesn't interrupt anything you do. You can reload your gun while going into the pip boy with this. The only "problem" is it's clearly intended only for the default FOV and leaves ugly dark bars around the screen if you have it set higher, although I would argue that's still better than the incredibly zoomed out normal pip boy with a higher FOV
---
i got one
---
Thank you for all the answer and upvotes people
---
I pretty thoroughly answered this before your comment.
---
I guess I'll just hope other players are there as well because my melees aren't phenomenal lmao
---
Hit me up when you do we can run it. Normally I would’ve not been able to until tonight. But I had a vacation day from work and are in school and took wife to at home so she’s all good
---
😂 Transparent aluminium! That’s the ticket, laddie.
---
PC? I would buy all of them since I have never done Fashnaut.
---
No plan for me yet, ever. Last night I got the Tenderizer itself for the first time.
---
I mean i freeze constantly... i crash, i get infinite f'ing loadscreens, basically everything that was pissing me off before i left... so yeah. I log in, i get my rewards i log out. They don't fix this mess of a game its curtains. Can only cobble things together with string and tape for so long before bug, on top of bug, finally topples this mess over proper.
---
I seel them often at 100 caps.  Just keep that vendor open and someone will pop in and buy them up
---
At main menu waiting for you
---
I see the quarantine is starting to effect you too.
---
 Honestly, if no one thinks a few of them backwoods settlers and raiders arent poking the scorched after they kill it, they dont know much about the world.
---
&gt;I felt so let down and angry at the same time. FALLOUT IS SINGLE PLAYER!!!
---
Multiplayer has always been a dream since the isometric days; excluding Tactics which was the first natively multiplayer Fallout game. It became a modded reality with 3 and New Vegas.
---
Fallout "fans" did what Fallout "fans" did best -- bash the newest release and love the previous. Granted, there were numerable issues 76 at launch and many of us wadded through them, but it certainly didn't help.
---
Time to shine! Go get em tiger! Also make sure to put that daily vendor cap limit to use. That's 1k free daily caps. You can get those expensive straight jackets from fort defiance, they really help. Also having a big farm and get some of purified water.
---
Nice to see that their healthy disdain for the players is still going stronk
---
More AP is always a good thing. I think I’ll get deep pocked for two limbs and then ultra light for the other two. I’ve been saving my gold so hopefully today is the day.
---
Been trying to get it for my melee but no good. Got only one of the mods plan.
---
Sounds like me last year... you poor bastard.
---
&gt;rapid-fire crossbow
---
For what it's worth, the NW crossbow holds 3 bolts instead of 1. Especially if you have Rifleman equipped, that thing *ends* people. You can go pew-pew-pew with all 3 in less than a second, and that takes down pretty much anyone; if you got headshots, forget about it.
---
The weapon is balanced out by its incredibly crappy ironsights and a long lag time on the reload. You fire all 3 bolts in less than a second, then it takes much longer to reload than it did to fire. Leaves you wide open.
---
That said, I'm not ignoring the very real possibility that it was a hacker. They are plentiful, and bottomless clips (also often paired with infinite ammo) are definitely something they can do. I once had a hacker on my team who didn't stop shooting his auto-rifle for the entire match.
---
I've got 1 and a couple of the mod plans. Got multiples of everything else.
---
&gt; it induces tunnel vision for a lot of players 
---
This happens with every seasonal event. When fasnacht was broken, you had people typing up death threats within a few hours of it. After it ended, people were talking about how they were literally addicted to running the same event every hour on the hour and couldn't handle it going away. With the treasure hunter event, you had people complaining that they took a day off work and spent 8 hours grinding mole miners and didn't get what they were looking for. This is a pretty well documented community phenomenon at this point
---
I got one and only had to trade a fixer plan for it. Thank god because everyone else is asking for fucking legacies. I got the pepper plan next event but that’s it. Only chally outfits after that
---
I was lucky enough to get 2
---
Nice. I’ll have to try that
---
Ok Be there soon
---
I have two or them and did the event like ten times
---
But I have only one mod plan
---
Maybe u need to retweak ur cards and get better armor/weapons....maybe even a better build, bet ur probably a bloody sniper who tries to tank...bloodies arent for everyone
---
Prime cuts bugs out frequently for me on PC. As well as many other events.
---
when everything but certain energy weapons have a 40-50% nerf, the change is gatling plasma and laser is probably a mistake and not a plan.
---
Honeslty you're going to be hard pressed to find people paying 500 to 1k for those.  I find them often for much cheaper than that
---
It has the exact same stats as before, it's just bugged to not benefit from damage perks, calm down
---
Never did it before it was required for SCORE points. Didn't hate it, and the prizes were an added bonus. But I'll probably stay away until Run #2.
---
Damn it, I want my meat prime, not bloodied!
---
I gotta ask, I keep seeing this term “toon”...what’s that about? It just means character or avatar, right? Where does toon come from?
---
Got it and 2 of the mods so far. A few duplicates of mods and still looking for the salty mod.
---
I beat the drums for 42 events, but yes, finally got the plan. Now time to try out my luck for legendary version at the purveyor...
---
It's kind of lazy so I immediately run over to the fenced in area to the right of Earl (his left) where I can avoid his melee attacks and just have to deal with spawns and his spit attacks (which I shrug off).
---
After making a dent in his health I'll go farm wendigos for screws and xp.
---
Thanks!
---
Just saying for the bosses. Maybe even just a tag despite the damage it does. The dealing x amount stuff is garbage.
---
Except it's more like after sneak attack damage 1,000 - 2,000 x 1.25 vs 1020 - 2020 x 1.0
---
Your toilet paper math sucks btw.  Fire rate scales better and in every situation is better.  Even +10% Damage while aiming scales better than explosive.
---
Have a nice day...
---
Maybe he likes you, my mrs pokes me when she wants some attention, yet when I poke her back she says I'm to tired.. Wtf.
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, WE DID IT!!!
---
Oh, typical
---
Especially considering that person just gave flux from their own inventory, since your flux disappears if you die at the event
---
Yes I got one, and the Salty mod.
---
&gt;Half of the fast Nuke drop can be done without the PA glitch by hacking a few doors and terminals (i.e. you can bypass fixing the reactor).
---
This. You have a choice to use your characters skills to bypass things and shorten the time you're in the silo anyway, or do it the normal way, or use an exploit.   
---
Using the exploit is what is wrong with it.
---
I need approximately 13.500 Points, I get around 6500 from all weeklies and 2000 from dailies of one day. I'm not sure on the numbers tho.
---
So it's exactly the same as every other mmo up until recently. Any game where there are 1 week raid locks are exactly the same principle. Time gating is an industry standard. Again, I don't see why people are so shocked and outraged about something that's been happening for over a decade.
---
At most. I'll give you a "Fo76 hides it less well than other games"
---
Nope and had the game running almost 24/7 during meat week :(
---
Try moving the your ally’s setup or scrap it and rebuild it in a different area
---
If you server hop the event will still be active.
---
It is possible to solo. Results will obviously vary by build but even without bloodied or junkies it is theoretically possible to solo Earle. But yeah, without '1009373662792976268937763' bullets or a Bloodied build, its going to take a while.
---
You can leave if you want.  The event will start with just one person.  There is a "lobby" area you sit in for 4 minutes before the event starts to give time for more people to join up.  After the 4 minutes the path to the event room clears and you can start the event.
---
As far as I'm aware you need to be on the server right after the bomb hits and before the 4 minute lobby wait time ends, otherwise you can no longer join.   I've seen tons of nukes there but the only time I've ever been able to join is right after the nuke happens.
---
With decent people could probably get away with like 5-6. I was able to 4man it with some good people but it took a little bit, he can be a bullet sponge lol.
---
I got 2 in a row somehow. After 1200 hours rng finial smiled upon me
---
That's an entirely different discussion
---
This was a thing in the beginning but they removed it.
---
Thanks all ;D!
---
Damn. Wish it was on PS4
---
Sleep with the fishes. That's what you get for making the situation... Unbearable. 😏🎉
---
And Smores
---
two words.  Super Duper.  Make sure your next three perk points go to maxing it.
---
That’s the problem, when I open up the build menu, it won’t let me scrap or build it.. just gives me the warning that only one ally at a time.
---
yes
---
So do you spend all your time here just waiting for one of these posts to come up, or...?
---
Best to quit while you’re ahead; otherwise, you’ll be like all of us. We logging daily to complete dailies, turn notes in, turn scripts in, and sell to get your caps.
---
The game has turned into an addicting micromanaging simulator. A big contrast to the earlier levels.
---
It’s been a well known bug since the very start of the Legendary Run and it has yet to be fixed because Bethesda clearly don’t care if it auto completes or not.
---
Yeah, I considered that, but you could hear what sounded like ten bolts worth of sound effects overlapping. I wasn't too mad to be honest, it was the first minute, so I just shrugged.
---
Block player and server hopping is the best way to deal with people rollplaying desperate scavvers
---
Back up ps4
---
Yeah it’s over, restart your console
---
Good low-level melee, Commando, and heavy weapons would be solid additions. Maybe some tricked-out 10mm pistols, too.
---
Making space for some silenced guns would be a huge help to new sneaky players.
---
I would also recommend putting yourself in Charleston or Morgantown; by the time people get to the Wayward, they'll barely have any caps, and will want to keep what few they have.
---
Oh god, I can't un-see that.
---
If you are not bloodied or junkies build, soloing will be very difficult and ammo consuming. I ended up soloing it too and my guns did barely any damage. 
---
I failed after 10,000 5mm x 3 dmg/shot. My best damage was from a primed F10 50 Cal dealing 20 dmg/shot to the head, but run out of 2000 prime ammo. For reference, you need to deal 48,000 damage over 1500 seconds.
---
Dont remember asking for your opinion troll
---
My GT is Zachy Chan13, level 370 junkies pa heavy gunner
---
Won't be on for another hour or so but am down to jump in if you're still goin!
---
I'm gonna wait to see how many people has their weapons stole by an npc before I play colossal bug update
---
Thats because the raven was incredibly rare.
---
Makes me feel a bit silly for holding on to the several i got last year XD
---
Sorry to say but you might have to move your entire camp and just re create it if you really liked your set up
---
Will have to look into them so far i have been a recluse haha
---
Awesome just to be clear your on PS4 right 🤔
---
Gt is kingsites12 be on in 20 minutes got ppl waiting for me
---
I’m a 300 bloodied build
---
You on a team? Are your teamates close by when the legendaries died/they shot it?
---
Thanks. It needed an update.
---
Yeah is that why? For a second i had hope lol
---
There's nothing more sincere than admitting you were wrong or that you changed your mind. It's not a weakness - it's simply human. Too bad that too many people today see admitting wrong as being weak. Too many people will die on their hill, even after they've been proven wrong countless of times. It makes many internet disussions insufferable. So I really applaud you for this.
---
Someone might just want one outfit, also I believe its a 1st only deal and they do show the prices of stuff that will be in sale each week on their website so it's not like we didn't know this was gunna happen.
---
Daddy would be proud.
---
It’s one perk loin, and that power armor would make the perk obsolete. That power armor has potential, but not if it’s just a green thumb PA. I doubt agriculture PA would have much protection, so there’s be no real use
---
What I mean by that is having an engine with many massive moving parts is not a reason within itself for these kinds of major issues with the game. Many game engines and other codebases work in a similar manner with even more complexity.
---
It's the disorganisation and poor management of that engine over the last two decades that makes it the mess that it is today.
---
Every single daily of mine was autocompleted today. They all displayed 250p instead of 500 except for the level up.
---
Also have 20 nuke cards
---
Yea if your teamate gets a hit on them and you are close enough when the enemy dies,  you can loot the legendary item.
---
I don't think it's much of an "if" at this point, just whether they will fix the issues with unarmed/energy not working properly before the patch. They're clearly fed up of hearing people complain about how bloodied stealth commandos can destroy everything in sight before anybody else can get in a hit, or how there's nothing challenging in the game because you can one shot everything
---
Here was my Queen

Oh well i feel stupid now but thanks for the clearance
---
Awww what? You don't like being a mouse on a wheel for feeder pellets? Lol. I swear they think we're all cattle. Chally outfit... so subtle. I'm onto you Bugthez!
---
Feels nice buying nuka-cola jumpsuits because you really like the theme, just to see that there's nuka-cola bundle. And you pay for the jumpsuits AGAIN. If you want the bundle. Thanks. 😒
---
All caps are instantly "donated"
---
I mean... color me amused.
---
NP, its a good thing to know though.
---
What.... you sure about that?
---
I can't believe they didn't fix the bug all season
---
Still a different discussion. Yes, a new engine would fix the problem, but that's not the discussion at hand.
---
my contribution 
---
Well known bug. Has yet to be fixed.
---
For real, very key knowledge
---
Is sneak possible in Colossal Problem or is it auto-danger like Prime Cuts?
---
Get them hooked so they have to keep coming back for more!
---
it's a bug. nothing you can do to stop it or fix it. sorry.
---
That is definitely going in the fap book
---
For how much?
---
Lol I did that and still can’t build the ally’s object. Here’s a pic of what I’m talking about:
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/cOCF7NS
---
Yes I remember assigning an item at my stash box inside the Whitespring.
---
Is it my daddy? Why does it need to limit ANYTHING? At best you're giving them a pass for padding out their trash content... at worst you're conditioned for Big Brother's take over lol.
---
Ahhh ok, will do then, i thought you had to do stuff together. Wait i can just pocket a PA frame? Wtf.
---
What I've done is follow the main quest right up to the part where you start working with Rose and then switch over to working on side quests. Don't stress too much about picking up all the Overseer's tapes right away; I feel like you sort of end up with all of them, give or take, as you progress naturally anyways. At the the level 20-30 mark I would suggest doing Miner Miracles in the Ash Heap, The Order of Mysteries, and even potentially start some of the Wastelanders DLC at this point. Like others have suggested, doing events in and around the Forest are a good thing to keep an eye out for, as well as taking as many workshops as you can and then retaking them when they get overrun by NPC mobs. 
---
Look for public teams that are tagged for Building (+Int) because it will boost the amount of XP you get. You don't ever have to interact with them but it will give everyone on the team benefits.
---
Idk, I thought the event was always boring. Now it's just boring for a shorter period of time
---
I think you just have to be part of the event, distance doesn't matter as long as you are both in the event.
---
Updated link: https://imgur.com/gallery/cOCF7NS

I came in late. (Month ago) I LOVE it. Still major bugs. But it’s worth it. Besides Fallout has always been buggy. No other gaming experiences out there like it though. They nail the balance between comedy and drama, retro and futurism. A million things to do in this game. Insanely customizable. No wonder it had so many problems, look at how much is going on in this game. It’s nuts.
---
I'm downloading the update now
---
Time gating literally every currency in your game is mobile bs. Stockholm much?
---
I’m lvl 129 and still haven’t launched one.
---
Also I got the card, do I need to do anything with the code or can I just go straight to that website for it?
---
i've gotten three from the event😅
---
I don't understand why some random person requests a trade with me we while I am out questing or farming. What makes anyone do that? I'm the type of player who keeps what I don't want in my vending machines. I keep what I use on me. No need to trade. If someone is trying to trade with me at least send a message or use your mic. Otherwise, I will either ignore you or emote, "So sorry."
---
...maybe
---
Funny you call me a "troll", as I'm the original poster.  Also funny you calling anyone a "troll" after having a look at various comments from you and how disliked they are.  Anyway, have a good day.
---
Perfect, I'll still be on!
---
This on the latest update?if so that's damn good news
---
We got to round 3 of 4 in the Cranberry bog and couldn't kill a radscorpion.  The health bar wouldn't go down and the scorpion just chased us around and didn't try to fight back.  Maybe someone was running their animal friendly perk card?
---
Oh, I'll look into it.
---
wHy diDn'T yoU rEaD tHe nEwS prInT? y0U deSeRvE iT.

My god.  Kettle meet pot.  You ruined your sons friendship over a kid who was “trying to help you.”  Even if you weren’t a proven duper/cheater, that would be low.  But the hypocrisy here is astounding.  When you were ratting him out to his Dad, did you confess “I should know about cheating, I’ve been banned!”  SMH.
---
Oh I'm not saying the game needs a new engine. That would be impossible at this stage. I'm just pointing out that a complex engine with many moving parts that gets continuous updates isn't a valid reason for all these bugs.
---
Other games and large codebases pull this off without issue. It's poor management at its core that's the issue, not necessarily a complex engine.
---
After you enter the mine you will have 2:30 minutes or so until you can drop to the lower level and fight Earl. I wait till the last 30 seconds to decide if I will enter or not. If the team is 3-4 players and half are &lt;100, I just travel back to my camp to do mi shit, no ammo waste for me. Unless you are a killing machine, I wouldn't bother.
---
 I failed 2 times, one bc I went with my lvl 35 alt and there were only 3 more players, the other with my main but we were 3 total. When you get a full team is almost guaranteed success, even if one or two are low levels
---
Right over your head.
---
&gt; spin the hell out of the meat
---
*You Spin me right round baby*
---
*Right round like a record baby*
---
*Right round round round...*
---
Next time just play fallout shelter. It will do.
---
Not new. Been that way ever since Public Teams came out. It may have been possible on Private Teams as well, before that.
---
I get done think they cared too much about fixing it. The bug can't be that difficult to find, especially since the daily quests never had this issue before they started the whole point system.
---
xMiNiMaC already online!
---
With Blocker on, some carnivore HP/Damage buffs &amp; some pychobuff you should be fine, your damage output may get interrupted to heal &amp; when you get feared on though.
---
MaN I jUsT wANtEd tO lOoK GoOD WhILe KilLinG THosE DaMn MoLE RaTs!
---
What rank are you now?
---
3 characters with 2 plans.  So far....
---
Hopefully I will get the mod plans.
---
That sounds terrible, tedious and incredibly anti player. I guess it fits.
---
Cheers for the tips
---
My biggest complaint was that I actually found a few of the things I needed before I needed them, but I got the “you can’t pick this up yet” message. Other than that I liked the idea
---
Unfortunately this seems like the answer. A real shame I've had a lot of fun up to this.
---
Well, in this case they'll probably lost a lot of players, quite possibly me included. Or people starts to use exploited weapons even more...
---
This bug has been in the game ever since the nuclear winter update.
---
My devouring habits are none of your business!
---
Ive noticed some items are being dropped individually so they appear as loose items on the ground
---
I just did that quest last night! It really did capture the essence of the DMV. Bravo Bethesda, bravo.
---
I hope and expect it to be fixed by season 2
---
Two shot 44, 10mm pistol with some mods, pump action shotty for the tunnels and a grenade rifle is the current setup, cheers but i have fuck all to trade haha
---
Now was ultralight also there?
---
I was extremely frustrated because of this but when you know it's an area you can't deal with, just bite the bullet and wait. I was getting my ass kicked by level 62 Charred Ghouls so I went back to the forest and toxic valley and just went to every undiscovered location. You'll find a lot of side quests to do and I found a lot of ammo and stim packs. Within a few days I leveled up and got the perks I needed and now I two shot those things and was able to progress.
---
you can log off 5 minutes before the reset and only log back in 5 minutes after.
---
been doing since day 1 and never got the bug, except this one time I forgot to log off.
---
To minimise the risk of this bug try not to stay online during reset time. I usually log off 15-20 mins before and come back 20-30 mins after reset happens and so far never got this bug doing this. One time I forgot about the time and stayed during the reset time and got half my challenges autocompleted without giving me score.
---
They can get squirrels there to use for crispy squirrel treat, that gives extra xp! 🎉
---
The post is "The reason Fallout 76 will never be fixed 100%". You contend the reason is because it's a game with many moving parts and continuous updates that cause problems.
---
I'm simply arguing that while I agree with you that updates are causing issues, the reason the game will never be fixed is because of mismanagement, not engine complexity. Your original comment makes it out as if Bethesda is somehow justified in this mess because of their complex games with many moving parts.
---
I fail to see how that's a different discussion, but anyway...
---
... Have you honestly played any other mmos? It's time gated because people could consume all the content in a month and then be done with it until the next content release. There is no fo76 sub, so additional revenue comes from atom purchases and fo1st subs. If you can consume all the content and then log off until next patch, they miss out on those incidental sales and fo76 subs because you're not playing daily. It is conditioning you to play every day, to the exclusion of all other games. This is games design 101, I genuinely can't believe you can't see it.
---
I played world of warcraft since tbc and honestly, every expansion was like this. You have the initial levelling process, then it's filling time with dailies and raid logging.
---
Is it right? No. But the simple fact is we consume faster than we create. It takes me an hour to make dinner and ten minutes to eat it. It took square years to remake ffvii and I finished it in a week.
---
Time gating isn't the best solution, but for mmos it is the simplest.
---
I mean, the only thing that sucks about it is enemy dead, then you have 1:30 to get out and if you start instantly you end up with like ~30 seconds left by the time you get to the bonus trunk.
---
They might as well just have the Wendigo Spawn drop zero loot since you have almost no time to loot them if you want to be a functioning member of the team.
---
Not a guaranteed fix, but definitely worth doing to help your chances.
---
Show me an mmo where Time gating isn't introduced.
---
dont downvote the poor fella he didnt know any better :(
---
It's kind of annoying, i'm really behind in the legendary run right now and that challenges were like 2000+ points.
---
I suppose i could get a lot of points still with exp farming.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I guess I’ll keep trying for the gauss mini then for the roll I want.
---
Can we get a NSFW tag, please?
---
They gave u a free copy to play the game u bought already on another service.   They didn’t give u another free copy of the game.
---
You're lucky. My game keeps freezing as soon as the world loads.
---
It’s caused by one of two things:
---
1: you’re online during the reset. Be sure to log off around 5 to 10 minutes before the daily reset. And log back in 5 to 10 minutes after the reset. Game resets at noon eastern US time. 
---
2: you’re completing the nuclear winter challenge before completing the adventure mode challenges. Sometimes completing that one first will autocomplete all challenges.
---
Right now it’s out
---
ended at today's reset. not a bug, you are getting the correct points.
---
Happy birthday tomorrow. Good luck.
---
what an annoying bug, maybe it just a sign to take a break from the game, haha.
---
Nah I run the SPECIAL training. None of the enemies hit hard enough for Funky Duds or the Fireproof. They're useless right now.
---
Also, enemy damage doesn't scale like level and HP will. Neither does DR/ER.
---
I'm a fan of watching a YouTuber called Kevduit when I need a quick fallout fix without access to the game: https://www.youtube.com/c/Kevduit
---
I was able to get in but got a blue screen 3/4 of the way through the fight. Rejoined a new server and just got disconnected without even a nuke anywhere.
---
Start joining groups and making friends. You can go grind with them in glass caverns, join them on SBQ and often people share their goodies and experience. Eventually the game will become less and less fun without friends, start early! 😉
---
An option to toggle maybe? I don’t want to be overencumbered every second. Best solution is to do like borderlands 3 does with the legendaries you let on the floor
---
I loved it, so funny and realistic...
---
I don't think it's about completion I think it's about the spirit of the event, or the game itself really. If there is only one person at an event moving around and they see everyone else is afk it's a pretty big hit to morale.
---
Apart from that, if you're afk clearly you're bored with the game. Play a game that's worth your time.
---
I price it at 20 caps. It is always bought. So I make and sell like twenty a day which is like 400 caps.
---
Sometimes I can't be bothered making it but it does sell.
---
Easier to sort out who to ban, I guess? Not like they're making it hard though, I can barely go to a queen fight without seeing a scattered .50 cal nowadays
---
aw... sad, mkay deleting my post then ty
---
An armed society is a polite society, I guess.
---
I carry concealed, but waiting in a line that's taking too long, or getting some bureaucratic runaround doesn't strike me as a "so I started blasting" occasion.
---
Yeah I know
---
They have the numbers and see how many is collected. They probably went slightly higher than the average amount collected in a week, as they expect people to focus on it more. The issue is that most people without fo1st don’t have a ton of scrap, and most donators have jsut been donating a portion of their existing scrap. I find it unlikely that somebody without 1st has 250+ concrete in their stash
---
It's the same game with the same bugs. Stay green I guess
---
Have a perk that adds to your damage for each enemy that has you detected up to a cap \^\^ would make exposing yourself to that danger worth it
---
How bout actually being able to mod the camo ss underarmor? That fix done yet.
---
And knowing is half the battle!
---
There's a mission like that in The Witcher 3 as well, just as annoying but at least the game itself is pretty fun so I didn't mind much.
---
That sucks man. Keep at it. If you get close to the end it may be best using some atoms if there’s something you specifically want
---
It was that way on private teams before
---
I’m almost sure that’s never been a thing and if it was how did I miss it.
---
I never considered blocker thanks!
---
Do you know if ultra light mod is only for the torso? I didn’t see one for limbs.
---
Just added you. Ready when you are
---
I'm on xbox and I gave up on the prime events, did 7 or 8 Friday night and of them only 2 completion despite lots of players. Just couldn't find everything that spawned. Certain locations seemed better but was just more hassle than it was worth.
---
I know right. I got so sick of this so I bought last 2 levels just to be done with it. Maybe it's not the best choice I made, but at least I don't have to think about it and still got extra atoms.
---
Linking accounts didn't give you a second free copy.
---
If you unlink the accounts the atoms and f1st you might have bought via steam are gone.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=patch+22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on
---
To be fair, it’s not any more unlikely than finding a random pickaxe or shovel in a cave
---
They can't ban anyone because of that - if they could, it'll be long done.
---
Your grandma is a beast
---
Ready
---
Sadly no. Just the pocketed and deep pocketed that were supposed to be available a couple of weeks ago.
---
Just FYI, you can turn your phone horizontally, which allows the camera to video in landscape mode, which matches your laptop display.  That way you can hold the phone steady and record the whole thing without moving it back and forth in portrait mode.
---
Hopefully it will include One Wasteland, Daily Ops and Legendary Perks like whats is in the PTS right now. The community calendar was also advertised to include this stuff for the update around this time later.
---
"Always....together"
---
"Cold..."
---
It’s not located under stored ? Maybe it thinks your trying build 2 And yeah the first one didn’t work lol
---
First run for me.... dropped from server while waiting for rubble to clear. 😔
---
Everything seems to be difficult to pull off on fallout 76.
---
But yeah this is desperately needed.  I'm sure it's on the massive laundry list of QoL/UI updates this game desperately needs
---
I was sitting eternally at 29kish for weeks there juggling about the cap until last night when I went to Whitespring and spent 12k on plans because I was sick of it haha. Rip.
---
You've been waiting literally for a months?
---
The ticket system they use autocloses the tickets after 14 days if they are not handled...
---
Looks like you found another bug and need to open a new ticket.
---
What do you Mean
---
lies.  You want the radtoad mine that does zero dmg
---
thanks,
---
\-Worthless coder
---
Ps4 had ps2 graphics haha
---
Yeah you make more than 300 atoms doing the full season anyway
---
Not sure, but I will confirm that you can now buy deep pocketed mods for SS armor from Regs. 500 caps.
---
Edit: on PS4 and it’s 500 gold bullion not caps.
---
Yes, most of us know.
---
Doing quest first then will be ready
---
same as PC notes, which came out last week.
---
Events are good for leveling quick. And with public teams the events teams are very popular which could double the xp per event. Also with a well rested perk which is good for 5% bonus to all xp. The momma dulces event I think called "feed the people" gives you some canned stew that also gives a 5% bonus to xp and it stacks with the other bonuses. On top of that the more intelligence you have the more xp you gain over all. So basically if you keep that in mind and just kill what you come across and do events you should level up fairly quick
---
Can I get a Brotherhood discount?
---
Not sure if it's related but i ran Radiation Rumble on my private server earlier and lots of the enemies dropped their loot in brown bags like players can drop. Weirded me out at first because i suddenly thought i wasn't alone!
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Not Bethesda's fault you don't understand how clocks and calendars work.
---
Great fun on XBox (even if I ended up with a cursed shovel...)
---
going and getting all the steel and stuff that stuff ran the whole day to put stuff in the box but the 500 dailys are gone
---
What’s your psn?
---
I bet it was a very angry, or gore ridden bat! 
---
Did i do it right? WHERE IS MY REDDIT GOLD PEASANTS
---
1) Buy new account
---
2) Log in on new account with BethLauncher
---
You can't do this the other way around
---
Ya, I got a cursed harpoon with bash. Lol
---
I've received prompt replies (ranging from a few hours to a few days) with issues regarding atomic shop purchases, questions about my FO1st account, and reporting a player. As much as people like to bash them, I'm actually really impressed with their support team and they've always resolved my issues.
---
I got it from my third try at the event.
---
I launched the nuke and did the event. It went smoothly.
---
Like a dailly reward
---
But the real question is: is this Bat a Swinger? 😏
---
When I go in with my melee I give earl some early wacks to get my hits in then I play wendigo clearer for the heavy gun guys.
---
Might be time to take a little break from the game.
---
Everyone join me im going to nuke silo now. Will try to nuke it now. No one on this server has done it yet. If you’re on a server that has a nuke active let me know
---
yes the dailys are back to 250 when it should have been today as well
---
483
---
Well, you can... you just have to use one of the three builds that happen to work, because Bethesda couldn't balance a seesaw.
---
*Nerd Rage*
---
mite be my op and you to go and comment on someone else
---
Loner. Started playing during 2xp.
---
I played for almost 1000 hours and just deleted fallout today
---
Wish me luck! ☺️
---
I do, but other armors got ultra light for limbs
---
Saw someone was running a silo so waited. And waited. And waited.
---
Then they nuke Monongah. The town.
---
Turns out some people don't.
---
 \- his scream that send me running
---
Not having had the opportunity - any idea if his scream is similar to the SB sonic attack, and does fireproof help mitigate?
---
And here comes all the band waggoners
---
Blocker is essential to melee builds lol
---
I saw Regs had ultra light for the torso, but I didn’t see ultra light for the limbs.
---
This would get annoying for me, I don’t pick up legendaries anymore and already it’s annoying to have to go into my inventory at the end of every event to drop the legendary I get to stay under weight, another automatic deposit into my inventory from just killing something would be even more of a pain
---
I take higher damage weapons, but I end up using a Vampire .50 cal for most of it.  I like to stay alive.
---
Congrats!  Now do it a few more times, and you'll find it a LOT easier
---
Good luck friend. Not sure how you made it that far.
---
Tbh, I feel like they already do this. I’ve seen some weird shit before from players with names like xXnukacolaXx etc. I used to have a video of some really weird activity from another “player”
---
Pacifist mode? Try jumping into a body of water? Onto a roof? Into a building? Server hopping? Calling the police and letting them murder him with hot pavement?
---
Embrace it!
---
Then do what they do with new bundles. Show the bundle and have them individually priced. Not individual everyday and THEN have a bundle sale. Especially with a lack of price reduction for items you have.
---
Not everyone reads the website.
---
Would you know why my download is 67gb? Is it the copying I see referred to in some of the comments?
---
So they are later
---
Makes sense! I played almost exclusively solo until a couple weeks ago when some friends got into the game. You should definitely start doing the event whenever it pops up because the loot is awesome and it's a fun time in general seeing the whole server get together.
---
I haven't gotten the plan though I have gotten a couple mod plans for it. I don't really want to learn the plan anyway because I don't want it added to my loot pool for Madam Mumbles. I don't melee so if I end up finding the plan I'd sell it or trade it.
---
I did my first solo one right around 45, did have a friend around 300 who gave me some good guns though
---
Me too. I thought I would be smart and AFK the event turning the spit while I was in a work meeting. Forgot about the autocomplete. Not the best decision.
---
def second master rifleman and popping on green thumb when you're harvesting. same with scrapper when you're scrapping and super duper when you're crafting ammo.
---
I'm on xbox and have been trying for a faster swing speed powerfist or deathclaw gauntlet for months...several thousand scrip to mama and so far dozens of shovels, pipes, pipe wrenches, pool cues, switchblades. Hell even Grahm gave me 3 shovels on the weekend as meatweek prizes.
---
It's getting depressing.
---
Same here, wouldn’t complain about a 10mm conversion either.
---
I'm tired of having event items crapped into my inventory, weighing me down and getting me killed.  Oh wow 1 star wardrum and a mini nuke... THHHHHAAAAANKS!
---
They need loot lists.
---
I suppose it is
---
Might be my opinion.  I do not care for yours so please bother someone else.   Did I get that right?   I mean you did post on a message board.  That action usually causes people to react or offer advice.  But since you have ask me to leave I shall.
---
\*500 bullion, i believe you meant to say
---
I've already got a proper bed, so getting the well rested perk will be easy to do.
---
On a related note, any suggestions on what size I should make my C.A.M.P.? Since I'm going to be doing a lot of redeploying it, I don't want to take the time to build it only to find that half of it's missing when I set it back up. (I've heard that can be a problem)
---
Thanks for the other tips! I'll definitely keep them all in mind!
---
This must have been your first double points weekend. They ALWAYS end at the reset on Monday. Now you know for next time, and can plan ahead and avoid these little... outbursts.
---
You make more than than just on the last level.
---
Dysentery? Also, Shell Shocked that reduces your ap when you are hit. That one always annoys me.
---
I like this tactic, minimal effort!
---

---
All these delays and I guarantee that I’m gonna run into a bug during my first run
---
Probably a dumb question, have you tried running diagnostics on it?
---
Cool I get low level dipshits in my instance &amp; fail.
---
I hate waiting 7 minutes to load into a match and end getting killed by a level 200. I thought all rewards were given to you by level 100, and there are people who play this game mode religiously
---

---
It's not new they've fixed it multiple times already. It was present on the first day of launch. I would up weeks behind my friends because it bugged for me.
---
It’s not bad waggoning if every other time we’ve had an event that said “ends on XX day” that it ended that day at the noon reset.  
---
The last time we had double score, every double XP weekend, every purveyor sale.  They have always ended at noon of the day listed. 
---
Why would this be any different?
---
We had 1 level 9 guy there too. He just died over and over.
---
You know... I’d be okay with this if they give exp commensurate with how terrifying and inescapable that is. It’s pretty silly though for a low-level enemy though.
---
MEAT MEAT
---
I launch an entire nuke solo just to get lvl 50 dumbasses in my instance &amp; fail the event. I’d rather have got the respawn bug so I don’t have to go crazy dealing with complete idiots who shouldn’t be anywhere near these events.
---
Can confirm his mamma definitely eats the meat....
---
several times now
---
Reliable
---
There's something like that coming in the future in regards to the diseased so don't worry too much about thata
---
bye
---
The one I was doing, he just walked right on up into the ceiling like it was a normal everyday thing. GG bethesda
---
So you hate reality then?
---
Can't decide what I like better, thread title or OP's handle.
---
I use a similar set of perks for sneaking, but I have one piece of Chameleon armor equipped.  I get detected, but will pay more attention during the event now.  You might want to give that a shot also
---
actually i dont run a bloody build. nore use a sniper unless boarded and hunting wild game.
---
I was able to stay in sneak most of the time
---
Perk loin: it's what's for dinner. Tonight.
---
Anyway, a lot of mods/perks/legendary effects make the others redundant.
---
For example, the refrigerated backpack makes it so you don't have to use the "good with salt" perk, and have those points in luck freed up, at the cost of other backpack mods.
---
Maybe make it give 4x flora harvest, and bonus carry weight (for hay bales and stuff) and just make it a variant of the Excavator.
---
They could even add in a little side quest to find and finish some farmer's DIY Excavator conversion for farm use. Call it the Baler or something, and give the farmer a name like "Jack Buck" as a nod to John Deere.
---
Not a dumb question, through steam on the game itself or like through system devices (reliability monitor or something to that extent)?  Any insight is greatly appreciated.
---
No need man if you're on PC will give u it for nothing
---
Makes little sense.
---
Is that just a bug or intended that way?
---
Patch 23:  Fixed a bug that allowed reduced AP cost with only one modded leg.  Now requires both legs to be modded to work.
---
F
---
I wasted an hour of my life launching a nuke just to get level 50’s &amp; under in my instance which I obviously failed because they kept dying over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over aaaanndddd oveeeerrrr. I don’t even wanna do the event anymore idc they could shove it where the sun don’t shine. Instanced bullshit.
---
Yeah the event is bugged the enemy’s get distracted by other enemy’s in the area or stuck behind a treeI’m always running after them to complete the event. There have been times when we defeat the dangerous enemy and the event doesn’t complete.
---
I’d love to join a group if you start one/find one
---
I'm guessing OP isn't one of those "paying attention to things" kinda people.
---
Yep, my bad, I just edited it to clarify.
---
Your download isn't actually 67 gb, you just need 67 gb so it can copy a backup file that'll get deleted after it's updated
---
yeah that's a super fun glitch. feels like 1/4 chance it'll be blank
---
Naw they keep fixing the quest. This is the 3rd or 4th time they've had this exact same bug. The other blood samples would bug so they removed them. They need to remove them all.
---
I hit my max and needed to clear space when you have 40+ masks it adds up it might just be like 5 pounds all together but I need to get rid of useless things and those masks have been sitting in there ever since faschnaut happened. Also I wasn't expecting for someone to wipe out my inventory that fast either it wasn't that much of a big deal in terms of stash space.
---
Definitely gonna keep that in mind.
---
This is exactly how I play one of my characters. As another commentator pointed out, since there is only one unarmed dmg perk card you can have the shotgun dmg perks in there as well(assuming you put the points in strength which I would suggest) Adding something like enforcer in agl helps a great deal at getting them to land. If you can find a vats oriented shotgun that can be very good as well,  though it may be patched in the future as the dmg is vats seems disproportional to the dmg done out of vats. Hope this is helpful. Also, just to as a note, the SBQ still can’t be crippled, so the full effectiveness of an enforcer shotgun build is mitigated at that event.
---
I really want one ... pc player
---
there is no benefit to the idea. nothing in it for the players. it makes no sense to do it. i haven't found the benifit.
---
Try system device for sound and since its on steam run verify integrity files.
---
Random
---
I guess, I mean when it started on the 20th, it didn’t suddenly change the challenges you picked up on the 19th from 250 to 500.  So i don’t know why someone would think that the challenges that go into the 25th would be different.
---
Launched a nuke solo just to get in an instance with 4 lvl 50 &amp; under players with shit weapons, shit armor &amp; no clue how to play! 😁 Love this instance tech Bethesda it’s so useful that I wasted an hour of my time with no rewards to show for it!!! Yaaayyy
---
Haha same. Sometimes I like to get on at the hour just for the event because I have raw flux and stuff I don’t want to spoil
---
I don't know if Mr Farmhands would be able to do the heavy lifting needed, and Assaultrons and Sentries weren't released to the public, so I can see a case for agri-PA.
---
I noticed squirrels doing this at the meat cook event
---
I don't know about you but trying to use the favourite wheel in a fight is almost impossible for me (playing on xbox). The moment anything starts hitting the favourite wheel slows it to a crawl during which anything can freely beat the crap out of me and I'm stuck desperately trying to dismiss the wheel.
---
...So when you die you don't get respawned outside the cave, unable to rejoin?
---
The servers are already back up
---
It was amazing right up until a bunch of us died and got locked out of the event. Super frustrating.
---
I don't use Chameleon because the visual and audio effects annoy me too much. Plus it ruins Reflex Sights. 
---
Just having Escape Artist gets you most of the benefits of Chameleon anyway, so it's usually no great loss.
---
I'm not sure if it's a bug or intended, but if you watch your [HIDDEN] after starting the event, you can see it happen. Even if all the enemies spawn far away and have no sight lines (the Mire location can be a good example), it will still jump straight to [DANGER].
---
I've actually been using it to call out when the spawns happen, the extra information is a tiny silver lining in the unexpected nerf.
---
What do I know, I'm just a "band waggoner."
---
Lack of frames is going to be the problem.
---
Does nobody follow their Twitter? Or know they have one? They post every patch note there when an update is happening just a heads up for those who ask these questions every patch
---
No, your teammates do not affect your sneak. I play with a teammate that uses 2 handed melee and runs straight into any fight and I can stay back and maintain stealth with no problems.
---
Is it true you have to use stealth suit or PA? Or can normal armor be used?
---
I find myself gorging on legendaries and as many treasury notes as possible when I actually have time to sit down and play the game for a few hours.
---
After those sessions, I just login for about 20 minutes a day and turn that crap in, do my 3 rep quests and log off.  It's actually not fun at all...
---
I think its just at the arena enteance.  I had the mine collapse on me and didn't lose any junk that I noticed.
---
Interesting. Thanks for letting me know!
---
How are you people even on it. My game keeps telling me the servers are down
---
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
---
Restart your console and try it
---
Oh look it’s mr. serious...wondering when you’d show up...
---
I'll give that a go and go from there and check on a device driver update while I'm at it.  I'm fairly new to games through steam but I used to have another audio issue (semi muted and directional in game npc vocals and sfx like ammo reloading) that seemed to just fix itself too.
---
I died once while I watched the other 4-5 low levels die again &amp; again &amp; again &amp; again. I was so entertained😂
---
Those poor bramin... Srsly people,  think of the bramin, being milked by those cold, unfeeling, black titanium hands.
---
Exactly. I could solo fasnacht when there was like 5 people afk, but I just can’t on this one.
---
Score challenges have always reset at the same time, and the double score weekend lasted 4 days as is. Not sure why'd you would expect it to last a fifth day, especially when I think you're suggesting they should have just reduced the reward of the SCORE challenges at midnight which is a bit weird.
---
I have been collecting all ammo I can find and buying up arrows and crossbolts when I see them in vendors for 1c each (they are work 6 points).  I then trade it all in for .50 cal for my rifle.  Haven't had to make ammo in a good 25 levels now.
---
Three cursed items all bloodied, not really worth anything but for some people who don't want to run it might trade it for something.
---
Well in fact this Monster was already available , seen one on the forest near the Queen scorchbeast
---
Hope that shows up for you friend and happy birthday to you! I’m still waiting for the vault boy and girl mascot heads that haven’t been in the shop since March of this year 😔😔😔
---
They need to put in some sort of proximity loot option
---
I do hope you're not thinking this is one of those documentary video games
---
Interesting, well worth a shot :) hope it does work for you
---
stop using vats and learn to aim like a big boy.
---
Is this hot fix also the death of the fireworks mine reload enhancement?
---
Damn!3 caps a pop? Xbox?!?
---
None the less.very impressive!
---
And they thought it was a good idea to give us dailies for NW
---
I'd be happy with a perk that highlights bodies you killed.
---
Very nice I have been getting a lot of the same stuff usually cleaver plans and chally outfits.
---
That did it. Wouldn’t let me get the update for some reason
---
His scream attack just sends everyone running in random directions. I don't think it does damage. But as a melee character, I rarely hit the obstacles on the outside of the arena, and like I say, it puts me far enough away for a stimpak break.
---
No! Bots Will find me in the Bush
---
Don't forget about the "cure disease" drinking fountain at Whitesprings!  It is in the dome, next to the Golf Club
---
Someone at Bethesda had a bad experience at the DMV and decided to take it out on all of us
---
Based an old PA mod chart I have, you might want to consider kinetic servos on one leg and optimized servos on the other, perhaps + core assembly:
---
Optimized Servos (torso mod) are +2 Str.  
---
Optimized Bracers (arm mod) reduce AP cost for power attack.
---
Core Assembly (torso mod) : increase action point refresh speed
---
Optimized Servo (leg mod) Reduce AP cost for sprinting
---
kinetic servo (leg mod) : Increased AP refresh speed while moving
---
kinetic dynamo (leg mod) taking damage restores AP
---
Shotgun with enforcer, cripple the legs, jumping punch his head off, répeat 
---
Rhink you can also cheeze him by crippling him near the place you fall and punch hil out to death
---
For me, stealth is working the same as it always has. I have 3 stars in stealth, escape artist, max AGI with full unyielding SS armor so I'm usually at 35-36 agi and I sneak around everywhere. I stay out of artificial light and keep the pip boy light off (not sure it helps or not). Once in a while I will have problems at scorched earth, but that is usually due to the scorched spawns and not the Queen.
---
I have had at times in the past the situation where I'll be in danger after a fast travel but I haven't had that issue in a while.
---
As others have said, primal cuts has tons of burrowing creatures and they can usually find you no matter how good your sneak is. I'm not sure if that's working as intended, but its pretty much always been like that.
---
Really cause from what i see its weapons with low base that get cucked
---
Did you become death? Destroyer of worlds?
---
Said "can't fast travel while taking health damage" =(
---
I'm stacking for now but if you really need somes pm me
---
Had some folks nuke the mine, by the time the rubble cleared to start the fight only 5 people remained and the others had ran away.  Lost big time but left with a ton of screws
---
If I went to the event and had 6 afkers drumming/spinning I'd be stoked because it'd take such a short while to complete solo.
---
And as far as me moving on if I'm bored... Nah...
---
I'll let this go if I'm doing other things.
---
How someone else might feel about the way I play a game is their problem, not mine...
---
You weren’t starving or dehydrated were you? That’s so weird if you weren’t cause I’ve fast traveled while some douche shot me 100 times with an explosive laser before😂
---
You want a SS left arm, 100% chance vs. 20% chance.
---
You want heavy combat left arm 1% chance.
---
You want a vanguard's heavy combat left arm 0.06% chance.
---
You want a vanguard's SS left arm 6% chance.
---
Literally a hundred times more likely to get what you want with SS, and of course it's pretty much the best anyway.
---
I don’t understand why people don’t like drummers or spit turners they contribute to the event and may also be busy having a life it doesn’t make sense that people get mad at them
---
your welcome been on the same server for 3 days minus the maintenance. just doing my part.
---
I feel bad for the people who wait that long. I wouldn't play NW if that was the case for me.
---
Oh I absolutely did! I dunno what he got out of it but I hope he enjoyed hitting the attack button 800 times
---
I got killed soon as earl went down by falling rocks and couldnt get back in there to loot
---
Dont be online at reset hours, dont play NW at reset hours, dont go to atom Shop at reset hours
---
Hopefully I can complete it next time. Got in an instance with 4 level 50’s &amp; below. They just got obliterated
---
Lol just blocked and moved on. He was going at it for like 25 minutes and I didn't really care since I was messing with my camp. When he made me miss Graham's Meat Cook everything changed
---
I just missed earles loot in colassal problem bc I spawned outside the mine instead of inside it and barely saw the fight bc of 60 respawn timers
---
I like the idea of converting excavator but excavator was never actually produced pre-war iirc it was just promoted and designed but didn’t get built before the bombs fell.
---
Edgy
---
Sweet!I'm def going to try this.but thanks I will pm if need be!
---
use wired controler not wiredless.
---
You can do all the building in workshops. Just a tip!
---
first try, legendary enemy has mutated with about 15 minutes let. cool plenty of time. server crash. well that was a waste of thousands of rounds of ammo
---
Yes, My friend thinks its funny slaughtering my brahmin. Fuckem with this please!
---
If you're quick enough.  The average event time seems to be about 2 minutes 30 seconds.  I've seen it over as quickly as 22 seconds after the 2 minute timer.
---
I’ve been in this boat for a while. I refuse to uninstall, but just don’t have any drive to play. Can no longer remember the last time I logged in.
---
Well that was your first mistake.
---
Thanks m8
---
Nah I'm non-stop loaded on Corn Soup friend
---
I'm level 232, so probably similar amount of time spent in game.  Two of my best weapons were gifts, probably duped, back during the first few months of the game.  The rest were random drops, a few purchases from player vendors, and only one or two from Murmg.  I used to visit every vendor on the server and sometimes you get lucky -- I bought The Fixer plan for 500 caps!
---
That’s impressive if you’re on Xbox I’ll buy or trade for one if you have one to spare
---
Wait so we donated shit to get meat week then they took away some of it already instead of waiting until it was over? 
---
We should get four more weeks of meat week for this.
---
you are not ready for that quite yet.  
---
Back burner that quest and go north to wavy willards.  Join the pioneer scouts.  
---
Roam that area until you are about L30, then go S to the ash heap.
---
While you are there, start the miner miracles quest and the firebreathers questline.
---
In addition, you should still work on the responders and mysteries questlines, as well as the opening BoS line (recruitment blues at camp mcclintock)
---
I totally get the angst towards rubberband spinners doing NOTHING.
---
Ooh that’s a good name for it, Agri-armour then get Bethesda to make up a dumb but somehow fitting acronym for A.G.R.I
---
has to be wired controler not wireless. then all you need is a rubber band on the right stick. and your set
---
How do people afk meat week overnight or whenever for extended time without manual interaction on consoles?
---
I price 95% of my plans at 10 caps each. People come and buy multiples constantly to resell. I can't stand them clogging up my stash. I'm just happy to get something for them. If they think they can sell them for more, go ahead. I've tried that and nothing ever sold. One man's trash is another man's treasure.
---
So the DMV closed on you and required more things
---
I'd like to see it as a non-perk skin, looking like you found a PA frame and covered it in parts from the tractor. Does diesel smoke count against sneak?
---
Question about DP for SS. 
---
I haven't bought the do mods yet. Can you put the dp on with a jet pack already installed?
---
But have you tried complaining about it on every thread related to A Collosal Problem? That should help.
---
All good ideas. Too bad Bethesda doesn't really care about details like this...
---
If your teammate kills them, you also get the loot.
---
\*facepalm\*  I seriously hate reading these forums.
---
It makes perfect sense to have personal things reset on a personal timer and group things reset on a global timer.
---
This is not a single player game.  Group events reset globally.
---
Personal things reset personally
---
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE IF YOU SPEND TWO DAMN SECONDS THINKING ABOUT IT RATHER THAN JUST IMMEDIATELY WHINING.
---
I had two below 50s. They actually mixed it up. Died constantly but where plucky. No idea where the other 5 where. Broke all my weapons, used all my ammo, failed it by about half a minute. But its doable at least, a good group should tear through it no problem. Super stimpaks where definitely my friend, went through thirty.
---
I'm on PC
---
Nice.  Is it good?
---
I'll take it though
---
it's not entirely on the engine, they also need to have the motivation to bring in QoL features. We had features in that direction in Fo4 already with being able to trade multiple items for multiple items in one menu.
---
Not sure why, but lately I've found that the market for scrip has really dropped through the floor.
---
That happened to me once, I switched off pacifist, got in my power armor and vaporized him with a gatling laser.
---
I’d say it’s less about the actually farming and more about the heavy lifting on a farm, you wouldn’t seed and pull crops with it but you would use it to carry hay, fertiliser, etc.
---
K.  Thanks :)
---
I'm melee also, but as you inquire, a heavy weapon for more difficult/PITA critters is always useful :)
---
Once the file copies 3hrs after downloading the patch I’m totally gonna play.
---
Spin meat / play drum.
---
Go into photomode &gt; rubberband / hair tie on analog sticks = profit
---
I've been accused of hacking because noobs try using VATs on me and I don't take damage.
---
guy waited through a nuke and 25ish years for his number to be called. would not want to be hr dealing with that guy
---
I suspect many people afk not because they are bored with the game but because they are at work. Working from home makes it a lot easier to keep your vendors open ;)
---
I heard it’s lvl 25, but can’t confirm.
---
I’ve never had that issue but it sounds damn near game breaking. Still though I don’t think a beer hat will make it any better
---
Honestly like.... if you’re this mad at the game... I can’t imagine you enjoy playing it at all.
---
I still donate Prime Meat directly on the grill. Still works.
---
I’m copying files.
---
Its insane.  I could be surrounded by rad toads who are being cheered on by a gaggle of deathclaws riding atop rad scorpion mounts and VATS would still be like "HOLY SHIT WATCH OUT FOR THAT EGG!"
---
so we finally getting deep pocket limbs for the SS armor?
---
Honestly, I've found my Full Health Junkie's Stealth Rifleman build to be incredibly versatile. The fact that VATS is entirely unnecessary on a Rifleman frees up a TON of points from both Luck and Agility. I can switch between Shotguns, 2h, Unarmed, and Heavy PA depending on the situation. 
---
12 12 3 4 8 9 8
---
You only need 9 Agility (3 Sneak, 3 Covert, 1 Escape Artist, 2 Sandman), and honestly more like 7 if you drop Mister Sandman, and 8 Luck (Starched Genes, Class Freak, Bloody Mess). 
---
I do wish we got a new Rifle with Wastelanders, though. I love the Gauss Rifle and the Lever, but man it'd be even more awesome to have an Anti-Materiel Rifle...
---
No. There never was one. That was just some stupid hearsay started by that one clueless youtuber.
---
Ight which one nuked Appalachia to f**k a giant bat
---
Ahhhhhhh photomode! Thank you man I tried the rubber band thing last night and it didn’t seem to work when I was on the meat spit thanks again for this info dude!
---
hide in the corner while the full hp chads tank all the damage
---
They were just there a week or so ago, on xbox at least. I thought about buying them but didnt have the atoms for it.
---
Two shot ftw for the tag and to spread the piles nicely around the core. So much nicer than pile-masking energy heaps.
---
Yes if you’re just standing there yeah you can leave but people who are contributing by beating drums and turning the spits are doing something that helps the event complete
---
Maaan ap is so broken that nobody can tell if it works or not. its very glitchy
---
Reddit has spoiler tags.  They are &gt;!
---
and !&lt;.
---
&gt;!Anything you put between those will be hidden!&lt;
---
Sorry for the weird formatting I was trying to make the actual characters appear and not spoiler things.
---
and after you accept the terms of the Baler, you can't work on it yourself or remove it from the PA, you have to pay 'jack buck' each time you want to repair or mod power armor that you own
---
why is the world loading screen so useless, especially since you are sitting on the screen for such a long time?  If you could access your loadout, at least it would give you something to do while you wait to get into the lobby.
---
C H A I N
---
I just had a conniption fit trying to complete Primal Cuts in the savage divide as a stealth melee player..I died about 50 times to those damn Yao Guay. I cannot face them without stealth and even then it’s tricky. 
---
It’s not fair of them to completely screw over stealth players.
---
I would totally wear a Big Daddy PA suit...
---
Twitter is trash and some people don't use it. Like me. Social media in general is just garbage.
---
"we are sorry for the inconvenience but we found a bug that would cause an exploit. This update has been delayed for 2 years."
---
server hop
---
I’m booodied and down to dying 1-2 times - I run a strat where I take out the adds, stay back, and then push in after fear to unload. When he gets real low on health do yourself a favor and rad away to ensure you survive the last bit or your ass is going to be trapped outside the mine
---
Yep, I ate two yesterday and dropped dead immediately. Just tossed the rest of them.
---
Yes really, have you played on PTS?  It's not a huge change, but certainly noticeable.
---
To be fair that's totally on the players that joined and not Bethesda. Can't control who does and doesn't get into an even.
---
Put pacifist on, foodbuild.
---
http://imgur.com/a/soFITqr

That's how I have mine. Plugged in so you never lose battety
---
Personal things reset on a personal timer.
---
Group things reset on a global timer.
---
Stop asking them to change the few actual good game designs for crying out loud.  NNNnnghhh!
---
As well, for the vast majority of users a 20 hour personal timer will be the better choice.  However to make best use of it, you need to be smarter than a turnip and make sure to do all your turn ins at the same time so all 3 timers are the same.
---
Deep pocketed and jet pack share the same slot, only get 1 mod slot for each armor, so they can’t both go on unfortunately.
---
And the severs rolled back 10 min lol jk
---
100% agree just a suggestion for those who always ask this question on patch day😂 I always see one “there’s no patch notes!” Post when indeed there is patch notes.
---
technically we got corona cuz guys who didn't know how to eat it wanted boner pills =P
---
Say what you want if these dwellers were so smart there would have made Amazon by now
---
that corn soup was fast traveling
---
I mean, if you look at pretty much any behavioral study or litmus test you will see the improbability of what you want. The ultimate litmus test is whether or not someone will return a shopping cart to the corrals after shopping. There is no one watching, no punishment for not doing so, but putting them in corrals is unarguably the right choice. How many carts actually make it to the cart corrals? These are the same people you play fallout with, and the general percentage of them that would be shitty if they felt like no one was watching is the same. If someone ruins the event for you via exploit it is both them and Bethesdas fault.
---
I am the same, brother, but now we can appreciate this actually fun game
---
Fucking galaxy brain dude thanks!
---
Hopefully I'll manage to grab it then. Doubt I'm going to get it from the event, I'm having the worst RNG.
---
I was totally gonna finish my daily legendary run to get surprised by this. I will will catch you, Zorbo!
---
Same thing just happened to me :/ seriously considering if playing this game is worth the heartache
---
Check Billings Farm, metal hut where the Project Beanstalk event starts. It's on the desk.
---
I'm legitimately sorry you guys are frustrated but this post and some of the comments have me in literal tears at work. I'm laughing so hard; thank you for this.
---
No plan, but all the mods for it.
---
Thanks for the tag! I'll raise this.
---
Level requirement.. no way you can convince me low levels should be joining this it’s not the queen. I shouldn’t be level 300 stuck with 3 lvl 50’s &amp; below literally doing all the damage while they die repeatedly... that’s not enjoyable &amp; a complete waste of 30-45 min of my time since I launched the nuke too.
---
If it took U an hour to run a silo, u weren’t ready either.
---
ROFL
---
Tbh since there’s no slowmo VATS for explosives seem pointless entirely. I’ve only ever killed myself shooting an enemy’s incoming grenade or messed up someone’s mine by targeting it
---
I agree with you there, the escape was fun. I got a little lost right near the end. But I managed to eacape! Just need the music from the last mission of Halo blaring and we're set.
---
I'll go a step further and say that I have the Plague Walker mutation so I really don't try to get rid of diseases.  I don't know if it is really worth it (probably not) but there didn't really seem to be a negative to having it.
---
Someone's mad 🤣
---
He was probably using a knife that could inflict bleed you cant fast travel while suffering ongoing health effects.
---
Yep, there's a damage cap. Also if someone is getting one shot, then their armor is trash.
---
Hey yo send me the exact sentence where I said “it took me an hour to run a silo” children don’t read they just jump to anonymously talk shit. Child mindset
---
Those are Prime Yao Guais. They don't fuck around.
---
 "are all SS pieces 3 stars?" - No, random 1-3\*
---
This and Fasnacht have the highest player logins.  They are giving players what they want.
---
Someone dropped a nuke just after a Meat Week, still plenty of people on the server, I think 3 of us showed up.
---
There was 20 as the Meat Week and it completed in seconds.
---
Lord I wish you could have got that on tape! Ty for the laugh good stuff
---
VATs broke after Wastelanders dropped. The only weapons that I see VATs consistently working with now is railway rifles and explosive lasers.
---
I've been using the camera to find dead things.   still, it would be nice if the legendaries were highlighted after they're dead
---
Get over it.
---
I just solo'd it in a private.  As soon as i killed him something exploded, almost seemed like the mine started to collapse immediately and it killed me at the same time.  Spawned me outside until the timer ran out and the game counted that as a success.  🤷‍♂️
---
If the event is on and u spawn outside FT to a teammate puts u back inside.   
---
Not sure if this works on a crash.
---
I wouldn't afk with my vendors open cause of the cap limit but maybe
---
I’m not sure if I’m doing the quest wrong or if it’s glitched because I’ve tried it multiple times and it just stops working after I get attacked by the named ghoul
---
Man, talk about unimmersive.
---
Either way, rude move. I hope he slips on a leaf and gets a real bad spook
---
I used death suit at first, but realized with rad shield I wasn’t really taking any rads once I was inside the cave fighting. So I switched back to my unyielding for the final moments of the fight. I’d say he’s equivalent to the SBQ as far as bullet spongyness goes. Not that bad really as long as you keep the Wendigo adds that spawn under control.
---
Wildly inaccurate.
---
It's possible to finish it the "normal" way still.
---
Same, even explained to people but still get shit from them.
---
Stealth* suit.
---
Add sloot mods
---
Or the "Lost Loot" machine from Borderlands 3.
---
Did it spawn like 30 wendigo’s at a time for you? Once I got to 15 minutes I felt like I couldn’t shoot earl cause it was wendigo spawn after wendigo spawn which is fine they don’t do that much damage to me but everyone else is dying then I have 30 at once attacking me.
---
I cant wait to do it later
---
"You're hacking!!!"
---
No, you just can't shoot worth a damn.
---
Yeah these foodies will never listen.
---
Tested after my PC restarted. Works.
---
I think you should quit the game as a protest
---
Exactly. I'm working on projects while going AFK on drums every ten minutes or so to the hour.
---
I usually tank their hits while scrolling through my favorite menu.  I had to check my armor and perks just to see if I had anything on after the massacre.
---
I'll chalk it up as a glitch and see what happens next primal cuts.
---
Cheers mate, Unyielding it is.
---
best part is when it bugs out and you have to redo it
---
If you fast travel join the event once it starts, you spawn inside the cave where there are no rads from the nuke zone. After the boss dies and you have to run out of the cave though, you'll want to put on power armor or a rad suit as you'll pop out into the nuke zone. After escaping you'll need to hang out in the area of the mine for a bit until the event completes and you get your goodies
---
Hah I like your appropriate level of anger over this. Never really got being a dick to other player for no reason, but it happens enough that some people must get a kick out of it.
---
Mornin, nice day for fishing, ain't it? Hu huh.
---
You understand this game came out two years ago? And there always has and will be protests? And these people were protesting automation taking their jobs. It's everywhere and very prevalent in the game matching the very real situation in modern mining towns
---
Because 800 stash limit is too high as people have space to waste on this.
---
Hardly spawned any tbh.  Think I killed maybe 4 or 5?  Also died about 5 times total before I found a spot in the very beginning that he couldn't hit me.
---
&gt; I wasted an hour of my life launching a nuke
---
For me personally the combat shotgun and the combat rifle were both good when I started
---
Damn foodies 😂🤣👌👍
---
He's definitely a bullet sponge. Honestly this feels like more of an event for properly kitted out, end game players. Noobs or people with lower tier weapons and armor don't really stand a chance.
---
Funny thing is I collect explosive railways too.
---
Guess I'll be carrying one of them from now on.
---
I just got mine replaced three days ago, and got the exact opposite. It took less than 15 minutes because they just wanted me *out.*
---
And I love that you can trigger J47 even after you've done the quest. He's so handy for when I'm too tired to go hunting the daily legendary.
---
Really appreciate this, thank you. Well I gotta sort the kids out but once I have, Earle better be ready lol. Have a good'n mate. 👍
---
cause Pete dont care whose meat he... spins
---
They can be 1, 2 and 3 star
---
Sure, the difference is there are other real people involved whom our choices affect.
---
I guess I can say it now because I can't jinx myself, but I made it through without a single auto complete.  
---
It sure was a lot of work for a lot of broken stuff.
---
So do I. Yeah I definitely remind trying them out. Ammo for them is super cheap and they make that *choo choo* noise I adore.
---
Yeah I found a neat little spot &amp; dude that’s crazy😂 I wish I recorded it I looked to my right &amp; I swear at least 20 of these green goblins are sprinting on all 4’s at me idk why we got so many spawning I never saw that when I watched PC players do the event previously
---
Yeah I figured that out too.  Not sure why people are saying "Turn it into Graham" or "drop it in donation barrels", you use the grill or cookpot in the center.
---
Shotguns were my best friend during early game, they do more damage than you think or what the pipboy shows. Plus shotgun shells are easy enough to find plenty of.
---
“ I wasted an hour of my life launching a nuke”
---
You can't get shadowed from Secret Service armor, so if you're a sneak build, look elsewhere.  The only benefit to you is resistances, especially radiation.
---
The chances of you getting exactly the armor you want with the effects you want is so low, expect months- a year of buying modules every day, and even then it's not that much better.
---
Yeah that's kinda frightening. Go on a bike ride or something? Go for a walk and pretend like your in FO. Get some wood scraps and purify some water.
---
I can only personally confirm that there is no cap up to 63.
---
I'm on if you're still fighting him
---
Just wish it had rewards worth grinding for. Too bad cursed couldn't roll on any weapon.
---
I get that. However, maybe try to start an event group or group up with friends before launching the nuke to guarantee you have at least SOME worthwile help? It's capped at 8 people so if you have a good 4 stack it's doable if the other 4 happen to be trash.
---
Takes 1 video of seeing SBQ stand there and let itself be killed to realize stealth is broken and it shouldn't be allowed in daily ops as it will completely remove any challenge.
---
I agree but the camp items are worth getting.
---
I feel like after 320 levels and how ever many thousands of hours that is, ya get bored with that game haha
---
Also you can't be one shot in PvP, damage cap is 110 for pvp
---
I've seen one of my boyfriend's characters get above that, but that's with unyielding armor and Berry Mentats.
---
I handle disappointment and stress through humor.
---
Well completed it with a team of 4 game glitch after we were trying to leave mine. So we all died and got taking out. I don’t think I got a cursed weapon but still fun
---
Eh, I don't think "End Game players" are the design target here.
---
Level 300+ Heavy Gunner Power Armor build and it still felt like I was tickling him.
---
I can't imagine doing this with the One Wasteland balances.
---
When I see/hear an Assaultron, the vampire's minigun comes out. Doesn't do as much damage but it keeps me alive
---
Thats the only thing im going for
---
People on the trading sub are trading legacy weapons and high end commando stuff for them.
---
Racist music choices?
---
Well, I've done it multiple times on PC, and I'll tell you this - you won't find a better source for Screws.
---
There's *zero* point in escaping the mine because you'll get the rewards either way.  You can instead go and loot all of the Wendigo Spawns, which are full-fleged Wendigos and carry not only a bunch of Screws, but ammo relative to what you were using to kill them.  I've come out *ahead* on ammo from this event.
---
For the limbs, yes.  You can have deep pocketed arms &amp; legs.  For the torso, no. The jet pack and deep pocketed torso mod share the same slot.
---
Greasy nerd?  Since you don’t actually have an intelligent reply you have to name call?
---
“It’s not as bad as red dead servers”, that’s not a metric for evaluating the problems with this game, and frankly shows how clueless and immature you are thinking this is a valid comparison. No one cares about red dead or is it any way at all relevant to anything f76 related
---
&gt;  I do what I want and I really don’t give a fuck about what’s going on in anyone else’s world
---
Easy there tough guy, apparently you do because you made a post about it, maybe your “friends” just don’t want to play with you
---
Oh look at the sub today, filled with more complaints about a broken event and my popcorns done just in time
---
Cry baby bertha 😢
---
same

like, i was doing a workshop retake up at the Munitions Factory and there was a wolf just chilling inside a pipe. i sat there for a good 3-4 minutes trying to kill this fuck.
---
In the room with Redeye from Nuka world radio.
---
I think this maybe a bug just you are having, maybe open a ticket thru Bethesda. I'm able to do this one daily and have never had a problem.
---
The Wendigo plushie is adorable, btw. Makes a little wind up sound and growl when you activate it.
---
All SPECIALs have a hard cap at 100, it was proven with the god mode exploit a while back
---
Call it something like "Out of the Shadows" or "Fearless Charge".
---
It wasn't "fun" but I did really appreciate it.
---
I've only just picked it up, im just enjoying mooching around the wastes, toting bags of trash all the way.
---
The player over 1000 was probably Alrex, I saw he was on a little while this morning.
---
Way it's always been.  Loot is populated weirdly and it will not be up to date sometimes.  You'll also see things like glowing meat and tin cans get shoved on to the list later or exiting and coming back will give you a different list.
---
Stop carrying so many weapons you probably seldom use?
---
There's 10 cranberry plants at Aaronholt farm, so anytime should be able to get them.
---
Fair. I guess I do it because I've been so bored with the game I've sat in the queue or played something else entirely.
---
I posted an LFG on Xbox saying “Wendigo on me” and many high levels answered the call.
---
Anticipate the problem and find a solution. You're half way there!
---
Same but I’m going for em on all 5 characters including my pistol build.. wish me luck
---
Let’s see. Event 30min. 2min nuke timer.  4 min earl timer.  Yup that adds up to an hour.
---
Same, and this thread has gotten me through a rough day lmao. Thanks again!
---
Ooooooh, Xbox can play Spotify in the background of any game, time to load up the halo playlist for this event.
---
I get that I just don’t understand why the instance was needed. If a boss is supposed to be end game (like the SBQ) which he definitely is in terms of health if not more than the queen herself then why are we limited to 8 people if level 50’s who are horribly unequipped can join &amp; ruin the event
---
I do something similar to this, build a character to a particular style, a second to another and so on, I have about a half dozen now all around level 150 or so.l
---
THAT's when it starts to get sparse. If you're not a fan of running into the woods shooting honeybeasts, meat week gets old quick.
---
When I get into this mid 100s funk with my character, I wonder what the level 500s out there are doing. By now they have all the perk cards but you're still stuck with your layout and it's often tied closely to the character's stash, like what type of weapons you've kept.
---
Someone here plays Scythe.
---
curious about your build, because I definitely can't tank a Yao Gaui hit.
---
Does the wendingo have fire resistance like the SBQ does?
---
As with anything cool, it was a limited time Atom Shop item. Sorry.
---
I have a question.  I play on Xbox.  Do u ha e to know the SS plans to get the deep pockets plan?
---
Oof. I wish you more than luck
---
Instance. I had plenty of high levels but I was the lucky level 300 who got put with all the level 50’s &amp; below who shouldn’t even be allowed in events like this.
---
Alot of players have characters that dont only carry weapons, people have backpack mods that may reduce weight of chems and when they have to take that off theyll be severely overencumbered, just one example.
---
No wonder I can't get the moo moo mask, you got 'em all.
---
I got to level 92 before I got hit with the auto-complete bug. I was setting up my vendors during the reset time. Before then I had no problem being on during the reset. Being so close to the end I didn't want to risk making it too hard to finish so I didn't even log back in until after 9am (west coast) and finished no problem. But I can't imagine being hit more than once.
---
That ammo alone is worth it considering I have a Gauss Minigun.
---
My thought was that the instance exists because the amount of enemies spawning coupled with the environmental stuff probably stresses the game too much to allow a higher cap. That OR they're trying to find ways to increase difficulty artificially by limiting player amount? I'm not too sure.
---
When I started I spent 30 minutes at dmv front of the robots waiting for my number to then realize that I was suppose to go elsewhere in building for my mission fucking DMV
---
I don't know what's going on, but I hope your day gets better and stays better. Take care, ok?
---
Mostly I find players just don’t pay attention and don’t know the game and then complain.
---
Fist time I've ever seen someone say the stash limit is to high lol. What do you think it should be then?
---
Do it like Steam does it
---
Omg mind blown. I thought I could only get them in the cranberry bog Sundew Forrest. Level 208 and still learning new things.
---
Well at least my suggestions are still good for anyone
---
"Later, nerds!" - Earle
---
Sweet! I just platinum the game yesterday on ps4 after hitting lvl 205.
---
Does feel good.
---
If you server hop after the hour there is a good chance you'll get a fresh server made after the hour that won't have the event.
---
U can keep insulting me all u want there buddy.  Internet words don’t hurt my feelings.
---
Weird I had it since wastelanders afaik, it often disappears and then when I relog it's fine. But it almost never works on initial load-in
---
Do you get a notification when you have unlocked the pennant or du you have to count yourself? And I really love daily ops as well.
---
I love it. Everytime I've helped one of my friends through it they start cursing like it's no tommorow.
---
Just an insanely stressful time at work; mortgage industry is nuts right now. Thank you, and same to you!
---
My problem isn't with the game it's with Bethesda churning out shoddy unfinished  products, can you honestly think of anything that has been put into the game or in the atom shop that hasn't got anything wrong with it? If it isn't underarmor clipping through, lights that don't work properly on PA, items floating inside buildings etc.. The list goes on
---
If I didn't enjoy playing the game I wouldn't have clocked 1400+ hrs into it, it's the community that makes the game enjoyable, playing with friends and doing events( if they work)
---
Don't use power armor?
---
I think it’s the difficulty one. But also if you have tons of people at the queen it can get really bad frame rate wise. Just wish there was some smart match where a level 300 doesn’t get stuck with really low level people who can’t do any amount of damage
---
It’s really fun, you shouldn’t judge before actually playing it lmao
---
The entire event? That’s a long period of time without being able to avoid someone for 10-15 seconds.
---
Nope. Sometimes atomic shop stuff is bugged and you can, but don't think anythings bugged like that atm
---
Interesting. I've never had an issue with this event.
---
I agree the set weapons a disappointing.
---
Christ, that's awful. At least some states let you renew by mail these days.
---
Thanks for the reply, guess I have to wait for it to rotate in then :/
---
I'd say that's most likely. That smart match idea definitely would help; I'm thinking that's some of the thought process behind One Wasteland. Maybe once that drops things like this won't be as much of an issue.
---
If you can get a bloodied sniper or a person with an explosive heavy gun to focus on adds (should probably have 2-3) and then have everyone else just burn down Earle, it's easily doable. The biggest problem is that if no one picks off adds, you take way too much damage and people die too often to be useful in the fight.
---
I just hit 98 yesterday. No more after this season. Leveling up everyday BEFORE I go to work killed my enthusiam for this game. Devs made it feel like a part time job.
---
It's a really fun quest and its tedium mirrors the actual DMV perfectly. But I would never do it again.
---
Yea, ive had a few tickets just disappear. It must be that autoclose system that makes them disappear.
---
Wow absolutely yes
---
Congrats. Now do it again.
---
Head east on your compass, that's where the exit is :-)
---
Like 3 or 4 minutes? The dude hadn't stopped knifing me for about 25 minutes at that point
---
How about when Earle dies ii got hit on the head by rocks and then dumped outside so vouldnt go loot anything inside.
---
Omg! Yes. Perfection.
---
How many you got so far?  I'm up to 12. 
---
I have all the good ones V, B, AA and so on. Just need the crap first star ones like Assassins and N.
---
Oh yeah dude I forgot about one wasteland you’re probably right tbh. Although with the huge nerf I think the queen &amp; earl will be much harder or just longer in general. I just got the crap end of the stick in that one
---
How much are they?
---
41 seconds? That is WAY too long. I prefer the times she dies in less than 10 sec and no one gets any credit! 
---
(Total sarcasm btw)
---
I was able to get the three mods and two tenderizers (one I gave to my son)at the first meat week event. 
---
I have been interchanging mods ever since
---
I get this also so not just you.
---
No one is claiming to be tough here buddy.  Ur internet insults just don’t bother me.   I’m old school.  Stick and stones hurt.  Words don’t.
---
Dishonor on your cow. Wow. Kinda brutal there.
---
Social menu. Find name. Block for session. Good to go.
---
Me too 😂
---
If I get another one I'll look there
---
Because logic.
---
Well, it IS Meat Week.
---
At first I was offended at the title, then I read the post 😹😹😹😹 Touché
---
“Remember me
---
Though I have to say goodbye
---
Remember me
---
Don't let it make you cry
---
For ever if I'm far away
---
I hold you in my heart
---
I sing a secret song to you
---
Each night we are apart
---
Remember me”
---
Work smarter not dumber?
---
Like Warframe, it’s really awesome idea 😎 
---
Here it is! My poor medal to you! 🎖
---
I blame the rubber banding health bar. Actually I don't blame anything.... After watching plenty of footage on the PTS I'm confident in saying people are blowing this shit out of proportion. Energy weapons notwithstanding.
---
Vita-Chambers certainly are from Bioshock. If I recall correctly, they’re called symptomatics or auto-docs.
---
It was funny the first time I did the quest. Second time it was stupid as fuck.
---
Thought about just swapping mine for a J2525.  Funny because it’s what I traded for mine many weeks ago.  Think I’ll just hold onto it though just for the memories and the legacy it holds.  Before anyone comments I know it’s not an actual legacy.
---
Problem is, on the PTS, I scrapped some of those cards for the legendary card system, so I don't have any build flexibility like I did before. They're trying to promote more flexible play styles, while also forcing us to scrap anything but the one build you're best in
---
Mostly, I find ignorant comments aren't necessary when someone is trying to learn a solution to something. I'm sorry that I can't dedicate 24/7 to the game and watching people that get to play on a different platform on YouTube, and have to work the day it's released on console. So mostly, you should probably pay attention to the way treat people. Karma isn't so forgiving. I've been playing since Beta. But in a world that is full of half-witted assumptions....
---
Had huge laggs during the Event. Playing on xbox one X with an hardwired ethernet connection.
---
I wish. PvP powers would be active
---
Well I usually make sure I don't run that low on hydration - but on the odd time I forget, having an item that would automatically feed you some water (even if it just kept you out of the red for a little while) would be a nice thing. One less thing to try and worry about when in the middle of a fight.
---
I remember doing this quest and telling my friend that this will just take 30 secs and I’m still there like 20 minutes later. God that was fucking awful.
---
If people wanna go for stupid fast kills they should at least do it on a private server. It's a fun challenge to solo or speed run boss fights but the people that do it on public servers to show off are akin to people that make their car as loud as possible and do double the speed limit at 2am.
---
Does not escaping kill you or zone you out if mine?
---
Undoubtedly yes
---
Yeah? don’t give up!
---
Possibly, but that's just annoying to be removing a full build just because they'll make it easier to swap out of later. Especially since most of the cards  I'd swap out from are now scrapped for the Legendary Card system
---
I know you can get higher than 25 but does it have any effect higher than 25?
---
I would go check on the pts but everytime I go on there I have to equip everything from the atom shop again for some stupid ass reason.
---
Reminds me of Tremors which I just made my wife watch.
---
I believe there's a bug preventing anyone from entering after it has started. That includes if you die - you can't get back inside.
---
It doesn't take 24/7 dedication to figure out how to keep yourself unencumbered.
---
Well Unfortunately on the PTS I can't do that because I've scrapped all my other cards. And I don't have much of an incentive after spending so much on buying a god roll fixer. I'm not gonna just lay down and let Bethesda kill my build without saying something
---
I totally get that people like to challenge themselves to push the boundaries of what's possible. But like you said, Private servers are where that should be done. And if you think about it, it's better for them too since they are generally more stable
---
There's also a small trick to this on PC, and it might be true of consoles as well.
---
If you nuke Monongah Mine, and then later launch a nuke on Fissure Site Prime, you'll trigger *both* Scorched Earth *and* A Colossal Problem, so long as the red nuke zone around Monongah Mine is still there.  Now, of course, the ability to join A Colossal Problem is limited to 5 minutes, if you aren't part of a team that has at least one member there.  So, it's a race to kill to the Queen as quickly as possible so you can get a free Earle out of it.
---
Is it a bug or intentional feature? The entire mine was closed when i reloaded my game
---
caps?
---
All the replies are such an example of RNG. Right?
---
While I have no love of Bethesda...there will always be something somewhere that gets missed. I can't imagine a game that's 100% - though it would be nice if Beth at least TRIED.
---
I don't blame a store for someone robbing them, I blame the robber. Just because it's possible to find a flaw somewhere to do something doesn't mean that we should run out and look for it. If these players go out and find exploits...and often just for the sake of ruining things for others...I blame them. 
---
My blame on Bethesda is when they don't FIX the issues, not on players behaving poorly.
---
It all depends on how YOU want to play it.
---
All weapon types have viable builds, well almost, energy weapons don't have many perks.
---
You want to put some damage perks for whatever direction you go.
---
Shotgun perks if you want to use your shotgun more.
---
Commando perks if you want to go automatic rifle.
---
Rifleman if you want to use semi-auto rifles.
---
Handmade is good medium range weapon, but ammo is hard to come by unless you craft it, good as an automatic.
---
Combat rifle ammo is easier to get, but has significantly more recoil. But is still a good weapon. The unique variant "The Fixer" has more damage than a base combat rifle, and shares the mods of a combat rifle. You can also around for people to craft one for you if you want. If you want to farm combat rifles, the theme park in toxic valley is a good place to kill scorched for combat rifles and combat shotguns. You can also leech off a Line in the Sand event to get them. Just tag enemies with molotovs and loot after the event is over.
---
Assault rifle uses the same ammo as the handmade, but is just worse. If you don't have a handmade, I think you are better off with an combat rifle.
---
Lever-Action Rifle is a semi-auto only weapon, has good stopping power, but low ammo capacity. Like a more rapid fire hunting rifle.
---
Combat shotguns are nice in that they reload quickly if you fire off all your ammo.
---
Pump action is nice if you only shoot off one or two rounds at a time.
---
Tato salads are deadly to you, maybe if you can convince a scorced to eat one.
---
Ok this i can grasp... Yeah we have guns but where would they come into play here. Speaking of real life vs gaming.
---
So you think rather than wait in line at the DMV, we should draw our firearm and start killing those in front of us? If you have that mindset, it explains why your citizens can't carry guns.
---
on the bright side he also didnt get to the cook out
---
Have you used recon scopes before? When you aim at an enemy with a recon scope it puts a temporary marker on your hud’s compass and a marker floating above the enemy
---
She's got herpes tho.
---
I'd be fine with it being risky, it's already risky as is and I need to stack a lot of sneak bonuses just to stay in [Caution] but with the Daily ops, i'm forced into [Danger] meaning nothing about sneak even works. It's not that Sneak Glass Canons are more dangerous in Ops, it's that there's no point to them in there.
---
It’s you that’s ignorant. If you can’t find a way to not be over encumbered and then fucking whine about i, then your the one that’s the problem. Not the game. 
---
No one even me ruined having to dedicate your life to a game. It’s the simplest thing to understand, you can carry xxx amount of weight before being over encumbered. 
---
Duh!! But instead you hoard everything and clearly put NO thought into.
---
So yeah. Your problem. Not the games.
---
Looks like i did it the other way... 
---
I just got to the airport. I did the quest at the airport and now doing the sidequest there. My second mainquest is to find a body for the robot i rescued. Wasted a lot of time with events, workshops and just wandering around and everytime the meat event pops up.. iam in.  
---
now iam level 31 beating the shit out of level 1-5 enemys...  and have 8k Caps after i bought a lot from other players camps. 
---
I would take 1 or 2 or 3 workshops and do the events you can do alone or joining an allready ongoing event with other players. You have to defend the workshops from time to time, that gives xp and blueprints and other stuff. Build some Extractors and dont lock them so if someone passing they can take some loot and dont take the Workshop or build nothing at all... 
---
And for sure... do some exploring... There is a litte story in near every house or ruin you can find while traveling.
---
It is wired
---
,
---
Join a public team for the event, then you can travel in to the event no matter what.  Also if someone is in the mine and is a team leader with space, you can join team, travel into the event and join in.
---
I have also used that to do 2 events back to back quite a few times.... double rewards :-)
---
The quest for the right weapon is never ending.
---
Whos Maggie again 
---
I haven't played in a week
---
The risk is you die in one hit. 
---
I like bloodied because it eliminates all the sponginess, from me and the enemies. If you prefer sponginess go full health/lower damage and you and enemies can stand in front of each other unloading clips into one another. 
---
It was just nice to have a choice.
---
And @ Zacky chan gets two in a row
---
Everything was "nerfed" because they changed how the damage is calculated. Bloodied is still on top.
---
Everyone’s got something in the wasteland
---
Do you mean you can trade scrip among different characters?  If yes, how so?
---
"having 5 chars = up to 5 times more storage = up to 5 times more legendaries you can farm before scrip limit and stash limits are reached."
---
Should have both on
---
Yeah, it's annoying, but that's kind of the point.
---
New npc tied to colossus problem
---
I mean, it doesn't end until September 8th, so you should have plenty of time to finish your levels. Tomorrow we get the weekly reset, so there's that opportunity for SCORE as well.
---
The shovel is decent for the one daily and smacking trash mobs.
---
I wanted to shoot the robots afterward.
---
You have two more weeks. That’s about 51,000 potential SCORE and you need less than 7000 to go from rank 98 to rank 100. 
---
You’ll be fine.
---
Cursed could have been an amazing opportunity to offer legendary versions of weapons that are not normally legendary. I'm talking level 50 chainsaws and drills with 3* legendary effects. If they are going to be throwaway weapons for collecting and decorating only they could have at least been unique.
---
He's so Bethesda he's got bugs in the title. Dude's in his element.
---
Couldn't agree more. I've been speed running Earle with a small group of people on Private Servers and having a blast. At least we get to control the conditions to an extent. Killing bosses fast is fine I guess but only to an extent. If it's less than a minute, a lot of people won't get tags. We were all low level once struggling to tag enemies. People need to chill
---
Doesn’t make it any good
---
Even swtor was less tight on your ass
---
Perfect! Thx
---
Don't know if that's true or not, but I'm pretty sure having around 30 AGI+ 3 Sneak and Escape artist should be enough to keep me in [Caution] At the least, even in Secret Service armor. Any other Activity I can sneak about, even the Colossus event where it's much harder, I can slip into it now and then. But in the Ops it's full on disabled if you're even in the same room as an enemy from what I can tell, effectively useless.
---
That's what they were tweaking/playing with. Trying to stop lag, it was much worse at one point.
---
It should be close to 124 dmg, so not too bad. However when using sneak (2x), covert operative (1.25x) and mr. sandman (1.5x) which should still act as mutipliers (the way they do now) you would get 465 dmg at night with a suppressor.
---
What should I replace? Action boy? Or if the legendary perks drop tmrw should i just wait and get legendary luck? Then move 2 points out of luck to something else?
---
True. I think the time spent organizing for this would be well spent. Otherwise the heavy gunners miss out on those sweet, sweet screws from the spawns.
---
Yea
---
I ended up being carried through them, basically couldn't contribute anything, could barely stay alive
---
Play RUST?
---
Thanks! Guess I'm staying then.
---
That was my favorite mission when I first started playing and hit 30 besides dying a lot I got a hell of a lot of legendary loot cause it would keep resetting and sending more legendaries now it's shitty there I feel
---
It just works!!! 😹
---
No, all but one because ya know we can't get 100% whatcha thinkin?
---
Serendipity is debatably one of the most useful cards. Espessially on a bloodied build. Ive veen using class freak inplace of it during the legendary run, and good with salt for meat week. Its not fun, i mean its manageable with dodgey on still but serendipity is like god mode compared to not having it.
---
Wow, different perspective! Never looked at it that way.
---
I’m not melee either
---
I go mega light when I know power armor is involved. Store extra equipment, ammo and check the other tabs for ore, plans, maps and anything else that has weight and stow it.  Try to find the leg mods for your pa as well. Calibrated shocks I think it is
---
Kinda wish I could start getting fixer plans but nobody does encryptid and I used my card cause I thought it was part of the quest chain.
---
Vampires isn't as good as it sounds from what I hear, it's something like 1-10 health per shot. You're better off running Junkies if you wanna stay high health, i've been trying to slip into it for the ops but i'm missing so many cards I need for AGI without sneaking
---
Getting that as well now.
---
What hard work? Sitting on you butt and pushing buttons? Lol
---
Free Range! Thank you! I was sitting (at work) there trying to remember the name of the event. I almost googled “FO76 event with Brahmin” but then I just went with home range.
---
Abit less
---
They pussied out and unbanned all of them, but I'd be happy if they actually did it and stuck through this time
---
Same, got it in may or so
---
well being bloodied it sucks i continue to die. Also the boss glitches under the world
---
Oh yea I forgot certain events in Live are broken too, they really just hate the stealth build, They should just nerf it, not make it completely useless. I'd go for a sneak build even if it was 0.50X damage, I could at least still sneak to avoid damage.
---
I watched a level to get to 4 lol
---
Combat shotgun. One of the perks allows even faster reloads. I switched around the place you are and still use mine at level 100. Plus I don't have to worry about munching through ammo quite as much. I do run into problems at times, but it takes down most monsters well. Fogcrawlers, anything. The Enforcer perk staggers and cripples limbs so they can't walk.
---
Love those numbers. I'm right about there too (for the legendary run) but with the new event I think I'm going to revert to my PvE build
---
No worries, obviously if you are running into a wall while heading east you're probably a bit high/north of the exit :-)
---
Not the person you responded too, but I'd ditch Tendorizer for Serendipity
---
I was thinking if legendary perks drop tmrw getting legendary luck, which would actually allow me to free up 2 points from luck, then on luck I could have starch bloody serendipity and class freak, and move the 2 points into charisma for the stimpack perk
---
I got my new plate tabs online. Took all of 5 minutes and the tab arrived ina week. Way better then the old days.
---
FINALLY!  All I wanted
---
Photomode? I just use a rubberband on the right analog stick while in third person with the controller wired. I have yet to be disconnected this way. Is there some advantage to using photomode?
---
Is the event Public or is it limited to a certain number of people?
---
I’d drop Lifegiver to make room for Serendipity. You’re essentially only getting 9 extra HP from Lifegiver 4. 
---
Drop your Endurance to 2, raise your Luck to 11, drop out Lifegiver 4 and add in Serendipity 3 and Aqua Boy/Girl 1. Not taking Rads from swimming in water is very helpful to Bloodied builds, in my opinion.
---
Maybe lose Tenderizer as well.  Past the first rank doesn’t seem worth the points.
---
Deep pocketed limb mods cost 500 gold bullion.
---
Handmade ammo is same as assault rifle, I think.
---
Nah, it's amazing.
---
Probably the only side quest I actually enjoyed.
---
The mistress of mystery stuff was cool but running the whole thing off holotapes was IMO incredibly immersion killing.
---
Mule everything except a ballistic gun, energy gun, and aid items you use.
---
Edit: also keep just 1-2 armor sets and power armor sets.
---
This isn't an MMO anymore than Sknny's Quake Bar was an MMO. Shit, Quore could support 32 players in Quake 20 years ago. 24 players does not make an MMO in 2020, son.
---
I want assaultron power armor. Would sure be into that clunky shit then.
---
Why is it downloading 67 gigs just to delete it tho? It’s telling me it’ll be 67 hours until it’s updated and then it’s just going to delete it you’re saying?
---
Have you seen mothman totems? They were Atomic Shop I think.
---
People have been asking for this since beta. Either they can't do it or just hate the idea of us looting every legendary we see because it makes too much sense that there has to be some reason one of the most requested features has been ignored.
---
I don’t wanna work I wanna bang on the drum all day.
---
I’d drop 2 pts from Tenderizer (2% increase not worth 2 perk pts)and 1 from Action Boy for Serendipity. And probably another from Action Boy for 1 rank of Adrenaline.
---
Super fast kills have nothing to do with bloodied builds but broken "magic" weapons. 
---
Think twice, be smarter XD.
---
Yes yes and more yes. Been rocking well above 50 INT and it makes a huge difference on XP. I'm almost lvl 450 and I've been shredding through the levels during the legendary run.
---
(Context I was at about 330 with the board dropped)
---
I was not able to fast travel in, on a teammate.
---
Great reply, that was awesome. I will go farm the park in Toxic Valley, put it on my map last week but got distracted and never actually went through it. 
---
Line in the Sand, I will keep an eye out and join up next chance I can. Thanks.
---
And I could totally see scorched liking tato salad. They're like that. 
---
Seriously, great advice, thank you.
---
Well, i havent looked at anything about the legendary perks so you seem to know better than me. My only advice still stands if you can make what you wanna do work with keeping serendipity then go for it.
---
It's a great memory of what was possible once, hold on to it
---
Can i help you find the nearest MW2 lobby so you can let out some more pent up aggression? Its not that serious man, have a nuka cola or 2.
---
Me and 3 team mates kill him and start running for the exit which we can’t find I hit stims but my quick wheel comes up on Xbox freezes I die get taken out of mine get reward but don’t get cursed weapon. And looting him I get a stupid 1 star super sledge but get a 3 star bolstering scout armor. I got the colossus rug also
---
It takes a lot to solo the queen using stealth, normally whenever she drops all the Ads I get spotted, takes light shadowed armor, max agi, max stealth cards. All sorts to get to that point, I just use it so I don't get spotted and die, less so for the damage. And I would be fine if that Mutation rotated, Sneak could use a nerf here and there, but having it completely screwed over for every single daily op is just overkill. 
---
They could make suppressors less effective, they could make a similar auto detect radius but smaller, they could make it so when they take damage you're automatically in caution, they could make it so the sneak multiplier is smaller (Like they already did with additive damage) they could just nerf it in some way, not completely ruin the play style. Even stealth boys and the stealth suit don't work in Ops from what i can tell.
---
They hit hard and come in tight packs in that Primal Cuts mission.
---
I agree here lifegiver use to be bugged which made it useful for bloodied builds, now that's been fixed it's a waste of perk points.
---
It was bugged for me. *I had to do it four times.*
---
I’ve got them! Haha I meant to add no atomic items to the post, but I forgot to add it at the end. 
---
My GT is moth related so I go hard in the mothman sauce.
---
Yeah, I have tons of shells so might as well use 'em
---
All I'm stating is that both parties are at fault, however only one party is obligated to change it. The person who does it, there is no way they will stop doing it or a way to make them obey the rules. Bans don't work. Slapping on the wrist doesn't work. Players will have a certain percentage that are shitty regardless, the only one that can fix the issue you are having is Bethesda.
---
Maybe you are being sarcastic but which three builds?
---
Ok thanks
---
The new Colossus Heads drop are quite disturbing, they still move.
---
Legendary luck at max is a perk that ups your luck by 5 points and gives you 5 points to put into luck, but you can't go passed the hard 15 points
---
You have clearly missed the point of the post...
---
I did it about 15 times, got all rewards at least once. Spent about 30k 5mm rounds total, of which 10k was a single failed solo run (despite using a magic gun).
---
I find Encryptid much easier compared to ACP: I tank the damage with a full set of Troubleshooters armor and a VFFR 50 heals me. At worst 1500 ammo spent, often less.
---
I'd rather run the SBQ which gives advanced repair kits and I can solo her with 7k 5mm or less.
---
Yeah I dont get why they launched it on console before fixing this kind of stuff we experienced on PC, even though that was the point..or so I thought.
---
👍😂
---
&gt;my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, completes events
---
Can the event be completed by people only AFKing? If so, I think I’m going to switch up my tactics because giving effort is pointless if you can...
---
There is one www.roguetrader.com
---
Could you have locked a door at your camp? Could you have gone into an instanced location like vaultec university or the overseers house? (just examples, obviously your camp may be located near different instance locations)
---
who is that?
---
Fallout is essentially a cautionary tale of the dangers of unchecked capitalism. Look at how the major corporations can get away with buying off government figures and influence the laws being passed. The corporations in Fallout are morally bankrupt and will bleed the earth and the population dry for a buck. Killing protesters is absolutely something that they would encourage. Is it monstrous? Yes. It's supposed to be.
---
Luck, trading, duping etc.  My first purveyor drop was a TSE railway.  My birthday she game me an AA FFR RW gatling plasma.  Got a JE FR Fixer during Fasnacht, and a BE FR 50 cal from SBQ.  There are lots of ways to get gear.
---
Energy weapons are bugged on the PTS, the damage calculation is wrong. If/when that gets fixed they'll become usable again.
---
Think it was meant to be funny but it just isnt
---
I think everyone does
---
I forgot about crippling, honestly. Used to VATs legs all the time in other games, great crowd control.
---
I have 2 or 3 that I remember off hand. I'm looking for the AA and V ones right now.
---
This is funny, I just completed this quest on a 3rd character this morning. Since I've done this one before, and helped others too, I knocked it out in less than 20 minutes. I still remember doing it for the very first time. Frustrating but enjoyable.
---
Not polite, just wary. I wouldn’t call America a polite country at all.
---
“SCANNING...SCANNING....SCANNING”
---
I've failed two events because people kept getting bored and leaving the drums and spits so the progress kept ticking down no matter how many greens or guts were collected etc etc 😑 God bless the afk drummers. This event is so simple, it should never fail 😭
---
Itll prob drop in price in a month or so sadly. Market is gonna get saturated
---
True, I forgot that.
---
That's literally all I have.
---
drop a 1star minigun.
---
you are over encumbered.
---
To add, you generally want to use VATS for shotguns.
---
Shotguns are victim to severe enemy health rubberbanding when you shoot them outside of VATS. This leads to them rubberbanding like 90% of the damage you did.
---
Is also subjected to 95% hit chance missing constantly, simplest way to counter that is to exit VATS then trigger VATS again.
---
Magic Weapons paired with Bloodied is what makes these quick SBQs.
---
I'm down, level 375 junkies pa heavy gunner
---
Its be best side quest in the game.
---
Basically non existant tbh. Bound to happen in a game that where you're objectively stronger the more time you put in. Not gonna fight a dude who can 1 shot literally anything
---
How many points does it cost to use?
---
Such major problems with this game, but I've enjoyed it enormously. Essentially in the same boat as you.
---
Shoot me a message on Xbox. GT is scribe dyson
---
Bloodied builds can kill the queen in like under 20 seconds with the right chems and alcohol , doesn't even need magic weapons.
---
You can be normal but you will spawn in nuked zone
---
"I'd rather run the SBQ which gives advanced repair kits and I can solo her with 7k 5mm or less."
---
And that's why Scorched Earth is and always will be the best "End Game" Event.
---
Good Rewards that don't take too many resources to obtain.
---
I plan on doing it till I get that cool gas mask which will complete my look. So given my RNG luck I reckon that means I will do it forever.
---
Adlai get a free legendary you can crunch in the machine if you don't want it.
---
There's super mutant body parts you can display. I think they are down a left tunnel at the mine where radiation rumble happens.
---
Hotfix? Out of the loop, what did I miss? Out of town atm
---
I mean..15-20mins running solo, 5 min nuke countdown, ~5mins getting to earle and 30min fight is about an hour. Hes still a dick though.
---
You don't have to exit the mine at all. Once the countdown reaches 0, it'll pause on Exit the mine! for a few more seconds, and then you're transported to just outside the mine entrance as if by magic. Use this time to loot the wendigo spawn for all they're worth (but the ceiling's still falling, so be careful).  If you die during the countdown, you'll respawn at the mine entrance. 
---
In either case, don't leave the area until the rewards pop. The event is still "active" until then, and leaving the area will stop you from getting rewards.
---
good point, but does that message come through to the average player?  it’d be a bit like if there was a gta level where you run over protesters. too close to real life to be fun.
---
This made me wet
---
The sad part about Fallout is that as comically dark as it is, a lot of its commentary on American culture before the bombs is an exaggeration of America, not an outright fabrication.
---
First time doing it and the 60 second respawn is *horrible*
---
Edit: then I died towards the end, and having to wait 60 seconds, spawned outside of the mine
---
None, you get a legendary perk slot at certain levels where you can pick a legwndary perk, then level that perk by scrapping other cards
---
No but I am
---
It was last year. They bugged up the drop rates making uncommon items rare.
---
I’ve had the opposite experience. Nuked the mine and had a full squad of 4 above level 400. We usually 4 man the queen no issue at all in less than 8 minutes. We go to join the event and it split our team up twice. I ended up by myself in the event and two of my friends got in with 6 randoms. My other friend got in with 7 randoms. It shouldn’t split teams. The instance should pull teams in together and random players should get put in their own instance. Kind of shit.
---
Wow. What a dick
---
I get that but was his build a 1shot build or sid you assume it was one shot? My Vanguards Medic has put down many a PvPer who believed their build to be superior. Plus just FPS skill
---
I liked it personally, them calling out the people 1 at a time only for it to be ghouls cracked me up. Then again, I had a Gatling gun with explosive rounds
---
i think most of us know which song i’m talking about
---
I still have nightmares
---
My inquiry has become your problem because YOU whined about it. You're the problem. I didn't say the game was. Just a question. And no. Lol I don't hoard everything. Sorry You're an aggressive, butthurt person with too much time on their hands to troll reddit posts to input your two cents.
---
Side quests are often environmental. They'll pop up if you enter areas or examine things. I'd spend more time in the Toxic Valley.
---
I FIGURED IT OUT! 
---
I did not know my fully built camp was saved as is and it contained my first Ally. Omg I’m so happy now and not mad at the game anymore... haha
---
I think he's saying you're a tolerant people despite the fact you've got easy access to something which could end a life with the pull of a trigger.
---
Mine glitched through the floor. 🙃
---
I’m lvl 300 bloodied heavy weapons if you have slots?
---
I would swap points from INT or CHA to luck and run both. You could swap in gunsmith and scrapper when you need them, and just run 5 or 6 INT. Alternatively, you could replace lone wanderer with public teams and the herd mentality and empath mutations.
---
They don't care that's why I stopped playing they do not care about their fans unless they are content creators
---
Lol! Got it. You’ve got issues, can’t handle a game or when people see you for the crybaby you are.
---
As someone who recently had to go through the DMV's bullshit to get my license, the thought of having to be reminded of that, especially in a game that's supposed to be my *escape* form reality, makes me want to puke.
---
Its prime glowing moles that get glitched under the map, pretty stupid that there even in the event myself.
---
this is the dlc. you realize shooting protesters is a strange message to send in any era?
---
I submit tickets and use my cell phone for them to contact me. I get a response within a minute or two. It is so much better than waiting for a response via email.
---
You don’t lose your junk when you die in the event so feel free to pick up as many screws as you need.
---
And also, there's been more than one instance of Americans ending lives for seemingly less than that... lol
---
I’m level 300 bloodied gt is kingsites12 already took him down once. Couldn’t find exit so I got taken out
---
Yeah. It *really* sucked that first week. Always walking into a freshly looted bunker, doors already unlocked, terminals hacked, mobs lying dead upon the floor.
---
Yeah we do. Shoot me a message on xbox
---
I loved it. Much of the humor comes from the robots in the game.
---
Check this place out. I use Nukacrypt.com for the launch codes and noticed there's going to be a merger between these sites. There's trading, weapon dmg calculator, a price check, and more.
---
https://roguetrader.com/#/
---
I just have Pacifist on so I can shoot them back &amp; won’t engage pvp 😂 it’s my favorite thing for the people who sit there whacking you with a staff or shooting you I’ll hit em right back with no punishment cause of pacifist mode pvp’s lame in this game
---
Whelp I know what I’m grinding out
---
if your on the drums thats great, turning the spits thats great too. standing in the middle of the place afk ? thats where i draw the line! lol 
---
personally i know i have had the game lock up on me as i walk in to the area as the event is starting and everything thing is spawning in and all the ppl are fast traveling in and i was forced to stand there with a black screen and hear the event completed. got the rewards but i was forced afk
---
At least you guys can play, my frame rate is slow slow I could barely walk around much less do an event. I'm on my third server and about to give up and log off. PS4
---
I had that happen multiple times yesterday except that I did kill the prime beast at the end and the timer just runs out saying I failed.
---
Power armor with screen helmet that would have Victor's face
---
One thing to add about the perks.
---
Start with one rank into each card.
---
The first rank give +10% damage boost, subsequent ranks are 5%.
---
ex: Command
---
Get the first rank for Commando, Expert Commando, Master Commando first for +30% damage to automatics.
---
If you max rank all 3, you get  60%.
---
You’re the best! I’ve gotta check that out later when I log in.
---
Come to my camp in savage divide!  They shoot up my camp all the time thanks to commander dumbass shooting at the vertibirds.
---
Level 169 bloodied pa
---
haha. i might quit it because it sucks.
---
If you are playing bloodied don't be surprised if you die. This is a challenging event where being melee is dangerous especially with little health.
---
Shoot me a message please
---
I've been noticing this since Primal Cuts started, during the event you don't have stealth but for example I've had low level super mutants keep me in [Danger] after killing one from a modest range, I think in a workshop environment. 
---
Not that big of a deal but my standard reaction to this situation is to try and get back to [Caution] and similar situations keep happening. Agility 36, Stealth 3*, Fixer, Escape Artist, no shadowed, but one Chameleon piece. I think the Chameleon widens the danger slightly when standing still but never seems like enough lately. Could use some additional testing.
---
Depends on the region. On the great plains people are very polite.
---
what happens after?  i didn’t play through because of the visceral reaction of having to shoot people holding protests signs
---
It ran fine for me too! Died twice but no response glitch, got the cursed executioners harpoon and couldn’t find the door to get out
---
Yuuuuuuup
---
i will, thanks!
---
kinda, it's on discord I just realized I forgot to mention that, but you can meet new people to play with easier and it's a good place to talk with people about fallout, it's new so there aren't many people in the server yet.
---
ah gamer’s
---
Even as I was doing that quest I wasn't sure if it was the dumbest quest ever or the most brilliant.
---
Of course, that seems to describe a lot of Fallout 76. I have put in a little over 100 hours, mostly after Wastelanders came out. I still can't decide if, on the whole, I actually like the game. It feels like it has all the pieces of a great game, just put together in a very weird way.
---
Yeah, I got a Behemoth on his back almost immediately. Kind of pathetic, really. When you face hordes, it's more of an issue, but I have Marsupial and leap away  and am more strategic. I dunno, I've just stuck with the build because it's fun.
---
Yea i know.  That’s why I was messing with him.  Ahhh seems he deleted his account.  I’m sad now.  Lol.
---
Sent you a message
---
Thank you for the offer friend, but I must decline. It's currently 4:00 AM here in Australia and unfortunately I require sleep. If that was aimed at me.
---
I wish you all the best with your run's and hope you get amazing loot.
---
I sent you a message
---
My BSS powerfist came from a player vendor for 25k caps, my BE 50acal and BFFR fixer were purveyor drops, my BSS supersledge and BE LMG were random drops,, my QE harpoon gun was 1200 caps from a player vendor the week before wastelanders made it legacy.  I have a lot more but all were bought in vendors or random and purveyor drops. RNG sucks but you get lucky here and there.
---
People in Oklahoma are pretty cool(:
---
Wow max base damage on my fixer (no unique build but all perks) is like 138 or something.... lol
---
Lol yes of course people have had problems with the event.
---
It wasn't until yesterday that I had one pop that actually displayed the tracking icons for the target animals. They're all supposed to do that. 
---
This morning I joined a level 398 at a Primal Cuts run where he was one-shotting all the Yaos and Honey Beasts. More power to him, I was glad to just get the Prime Meat. Except we didn't. Because even though the animals had tracking, and we killed them all, the event timer expired and we failed.
---
I realize that but its unbearable to try to play. I am getting killed by things I can't even see. Im just going to have to focus on ads not the boss.
---
Ok! I was wondering about that! Thank you
---
Did they do it back to back?
---
theres a cooldown
---
There is definitely a problem, certain ones are worse than others. The one that occurs above flatwoods seems like if you kill the deathclaw too fast or first, before the bear, it seems like it fails every time. Had very minimal luck with that one, and the one that happens near crater.
---
The one in ash heap isnt too bad for it, the one that occurs in Savage divide isnt too bad, just hard to find the enemies some times, and the one in cranberry bog doesn't fail too often.
---
I haven't done the one in the more but a couple times, but I've definitely heard a good few people making complaints about it failing.
---
Sorry I should have clarified, these aren’t the power armor heads that I’m asking for but rather the mascot heads like the patriotic one we got for owning the tricentennial edition of the game.
---
No it's not exactly like every other mmo, it's actually nothing like any other mmo. I've played F2P mmos with more player-friendly design than this. I don't care how one special raid is only be doable once a week in wow, when we talking about basic features being locked like using npc traders. I've never seen any mmo where they did this.
---
Isn't melee the worst possible setup for this fight?
---
Sent a message.  Gt:shadyrebob 
---
Level 340 junky commando
---
I've never run Bloodied and managed with my under-powered full health build to do OK, level 370+ and more caps then I know what to do with. So it was hilarious to see all the hand wringing and whining about the nerfed damage levels and then see actual PTS footage of the "nerfed" damage which still makes my full health build look like a 98 lb weakling.
---
Thank you sir.  You have a good nights rest mate.
---
There is no cooldown.
---
As I said, the Event wasn't on the map, but once I entered the mine, it activated.
---
Yes!
---
Sounds good! Just need one more
---
The average current gaming PC has a bit more grunt than consoles, trying to deliver the same resolution in that busy/dynamic environment is what makes it lag, they have to trade something off.
---
Lol damn they beat me to it
---
&gt;You should try this mission if you're hard of hearing and rely on subtitles. A good 75% of the dialog never pops up in subtitles or they glitch out like world dialogue often does in this game. I still don't know what the quest is, why you have to stand there for so long, or what you're doing. I just keep talking to the robots, ghouls come out, and things happen.
---
I finally read a walk-through after not figuring out how to trigger the progression and looping through the beginning several times. 
---
&gt;I've heard people say it's funny, but Bethesda hates hearing challenged people so I dunno.
---
They hate color blind people too.
---
Sent you an xbox message too. Invite whenever you are ready!! 👍👍
---
Yes, this is called satire. The only sad part is how often satire goes completely over people’s heads. Fallout fans, especially long time ones get it, while GTA fans seem particularly bad at noticing satire.
---
Straight to the website. I got one piece just for completion sake really lol.
---
Or just let us play in smaller lobbies. Start with one circle smaller and let us Duke it out. PC already has people aim boting so I don't think they want to add more. And bots will never be the answer in a pvp mode, that is why it is pvp.
---
Honestly, it should. A huge part of Fallout is reading through the notes, newspapers, terminals, and listening to the Holotapes. The writers are pretty heavy handed in their negative portrayal of companies, CEOs, the government, and especially Vault-Tec. If players fail to do that, that's their fault.
---
Yeah like congrats man, you've played 2000 more hours than me, cool guns that one shot everything
---
Yea fuck that, I'm not going to make a Twitter account just to read patch notes. They need to post on Bethesda.net.
---
Marsupial? Is that a perk? Mutation?
---
I thought of that right after posting. I got the tricentennial edition of the game though
---
Julie was right. Those dear hearts and gentle people really are out there. Cheers for your help!
---
That’s what she said....
---
Yeah its super disappointing though, earlier in the week i had no problem. But it seems every one fails now.
---
Interesting...i heard from pc there was a cooldown
---
I did. 
---
Funfact. Night before I decided to be the achievement whore I am and stand point blank under someone elses nuke for Ground Zero.
---
The rads got in my soul!!!
---
It was funny until it threw 800 charred ghouls at me
---
Yep, to do radiation rumble is almost impossible! Always join only to go back to my camp as the meat piles start showing up.
---
that is my build I am a glass cannon but even the sq  I can survive. This boss nope between the framerate and the ceiling falling down on me because of said framerate I died so many times then I couldn't even collect from the boss since I had died.
---
Yeah that's true. I'm thinking it's going to be a rolling thing; damage nerf was the start to a process that will allow them to adjust and fix damage resistance and health amounts for enemies across the board. That's my hope at least.
---
I can later this evening after work if you’re still going
---
I had this happen with grahms meat cook just now. It wasn’t on my map as an event but I ran up to the location &amp; it started the event. Didn’t even appear on the side of my screen just gave me the completion though.
---
Because it’s a complete waste of time and resources for almost nothing in return.
---
I intend too after meat week and choosing either raiders or settlers. Lol
---
Yep, we'll have to swap to the builds using all the cards and level ups we're about to scrap
---
Already ran it once. We took him down. Only 4 of us being we where in a team.
---
That also happened to us. I dropped a nuke did the event someone elsedropped...nothing
---
I’m ready whenever you are my man
---
I finished a couple days ago and out of habit I still check the stupid challenge tab everytime I hop on. They’ve trained us well.
---
I've had this issue for a very long time. Being able to rejoin other events made the issue not so bad. But now it's absurd. I simply can not sure in the mine. I want to run as a melee tank but can't as a result.
---
I died last night doing a Colossus and just stood in the mine waiting for the event to end. I was able to get credit for it's success doing this. The mine collapsed and I respawned outside of it and got my 8 treasury notes. 
---
I've tolerated and even defended many of the bugs. I understand they tried something different with the brand. But this respawn/ft bug is beyond reason. It's been going on far too long now.
---
Interesting. So Vat up, fire, drop Vats and Vat up again. That explains some of my issues with my pump action. Bugger. Thanks again. Of I had awards left to give they'd be yours
---
I should have said, provided it's still before the hour.
---
I can join later this evening if you plan on going for awhile. Let me know
---
Good luck in the daily ops then, they all but said they completely disabled stealth there. In the PTS testing I couldn't get sneak to work at all
---
Ok
---
Nice.  I ran it once with ppl who were under level 50 so it was a bad first run for me
---
Some of the loot piles are despawning and the items are appearing on the ground individually. Also some of the loot piles are not able to be looted. So there's definitely an ongoing issue there.
---
Can you tell me how you get this helmet? I have not played much recently.
---
It’s the internet. Wouldn’t be surprised if someone said we had to feed them into the vending machine. :)
---
My pet theory is they did it to show they find constantly writing the BoS to be tedious. They made the quest this way so the player could understand how it feels to be forced to re-hash the same recognizable things ad nauseam.
---
It’s ok though, because one wasteland will make sure you deal no dmg AND die constantly. Perfectly balanced
---
Scorched parts in jars at Morgantown.  Medical hanger. 
---
Human bones can be displayed.  Not all. 
---
Sheepsquash skulls and horns. 
---
Wendigo vocal sacs.
---
So you're the guy that doesn't shoot the radtoad projectile 2 miles away eh? Cringe bro
---
I do it for the challenge, once you get all the rewards its then how fast you can do it, much like SBQ really.
---
why does it matter? is it really that big of an issue to make a post about it. their his mask now he can sell it for how ever much he wants to sell them for and if someone wants to pay that much for it then thats on them...idk why it bothers you i dont get why people feel they have the right to tell people how much they should sell their stuff for.
---
Does this fix An ounce of prevention? I've recently came back to 76 and started over. Got this bug straight away
---
Yo kind strangers, may have a potential fix for this was stuck on it for a while didn't matter if I put the sample in first or did the fuse first even reloaded more times than I care to remember. Same problem for a pal too but when we did it as part of a team (public team set to building) worked both times first time round, I really hope this helps some of you because God it's a bloody annoying bug!
---
Upvote for Michael Scott joke.
---
From the new Colossal Problem event, it's a 5% chance as reward.
---
Maybe the story can be that because it's only been 25 years since the war, the helmet is often found still working for now.
---
Just try to kill scorchbeast now on PTS, and come back telling me that more time to kill doesnt make it harder. You get swarmed by scortched, you have to run, hide, be spot on.
---
I like it, but it's definitively harder.
---
That really sucks. I've also missed a few, not because of this, but because the player icons are over the Event Icon... So I couldn't get there in time.
---
Will do
---
You’d have to be one rich farmer to afford a suit of power armor.  I know it’s a video game set in a fictional world, but excavator suits make sense because there’s a lucrative mining concern behind the expense.
---
Wow this subreddit never fails to deliver. Thank you thank you 🙏
---
We nearly got him,  a small chunk of his second health bar left. Problem we had was he got stuck in the roof, and went completely AWOL for nearly 10 minutes.
---
Iv seen a 1300 and something on Xbox
---
I hated it too. I was cussing like a sailor and just thinking about killing those robots when I was done lol
---
Yeah I got shit drop from earl then the exit couldn’t find and died because Xbox lagged and put me on quick wheel instead of healing me. So we get taken out of mine and I get no cursed weapons. Got some flux some treasury notes which I have over 100 from meat week. Got the colossus rug tho. Got a 3 star bolstering scout armor piece I’ll never use tho.
---
My magic junkies kills the queen just as fast as my bloodied.
---
Covid has opened so many opportunities. In six months I've started four new characters and we're sitting at lvls 149, 127, 113, and 50 while still holding full time hours.
---
For a while it was just the only way to keep in contact with my friends, now it's a nightly/weekend ritual!
---
Also I felt driven to catch up as before this started my position required 100% travel and I just couldn't play much 😕
---
8 treasury notes per go also.
---
We just finished a go. I didn't get any cursed weapon, Earle rug, plush, or totem thing. A little disappointed, but it was a fun experience.
---
I did the same thing, my main problem playing on day one was the world felt empty. When I heard about the wastelanders update gave it another go, and now I love it. I think they also deserve credit for the way they have setup the pvp.
---
at least you read it, unlike 99% of people who answer.
---
If you want to test it out &amp; find a 1-3\* Bloodied Fixer you need these: Max rank on each perk card:  Commando perks, bloody mess, nerd rage, strange in numbers, adrenaline, revenant, small guns bobblehead, psycho and overdrive.
---
The only thing missing is Ballistic Bock but as a solo player I got the adrenaline and revenant at the same time so I passed the BB.
---
basically
---
But isn’t the whole point you have to wait for the robots to print out an ID for you? And if you tried to cut or be aggressive they’d just shut down and refuse to serve you?
---
It should be lvl 1 though 🙃
---
You’re entitled to nothing.
---
Not an outfit any more. I wore them with my BoS beret, but from today it’s back to how it was. Hopefully they will be adding BoS outfits with the coming BoS update.
---
Lol yeah that’s what I meant by stored when you move camps it saves all components incase you wanted the same lay out just in a different location
---
Has it auto stored as a blueprint or in the storage section of the build menu?
---
Looks almost like the vendor glitch but with the scavenger station instead
---
Well for that you could hop to Vault 76 or join one of the public groups that are there?
---
I was mostly being sarcastic, buuuuuut I think it is roughly three:
---
* Bloodied commando
---
* Heavy gunner
---
* Junkie commando
---
Undoubtedly there are more variations. You can get away with a lot of bloodied stuff, even after the rebalance, but bloodied melee I think is toast now, at least I can't keep it rolling in Primal Cuts cuz I relied on stealth too. 
---
I've rolled 4 characters up to lvl 70+, they all end up using a Gatling Plasma eventually. I tried stealth rifles this time, it falls apart as soon as you hit bullet sponges because while the damage is high, the fire rate is not. It's all just high DPS now, fire lots of bullets and fire them fast, find ways to multiply or boost that damage.
---
Me too, PA heavy gun build, junkies explosive gat plasma, junkies explosive 50 cal, j/ffr flamer,T-65 suit; and I’m barely seeing his health bar go down.  6 plasma cores, 2000 flamer fuel, 1500 50 cal rounds, most other players in the mine are constant skull icons.  Severe lag to the point that Earl looked like an 8 bit NES blob.  Probably won’t be returning to the mine anytime soon; one wasteland probably won’t help.
---
I don’t care about the ammo, it’s the lag that’s the real enemy here.
---
I just noticed you can switch walls to doorways again now! Thank you Bethesda for reverting that.
---
OMG...where's my eye's rolling emogi??!!
---
You can get addicted to it, I am myself!. 5 is not the limit. It can take more than that, it's just uncommon for it to take more. 8 sounds too much but keep trying and IF it still dont work than something's wrong
---
True didnt know that. but ive been grinding meat week hard and have 249 right now so i didnt even notice the treasury notes. Lol
---
I've played this game long enough to know better than to try new stuff on release day. It would be nice but we all know that it'll be months before Colossal Problem works properly (if ever) so I'll just hold off for a while.
---
Same story with my character, some (not most people here) are just salty they can’t just one shot everything. This change might bring their builds “back to Earth” so to speak just a little but they are just mad.
---
I understand what you're saying, but no it doesn't. The second bullet only does 25% damage and is subject to higher inaccuracy. A Gatling gun with 25% faster fire rate would out DPS it in most instances.
---
No you’re set. Just make sure you have your nuclear keycard, go to nukacrypt and find the right code for the silo you’re in. They’ll have the codes for all three silos side by side so it’s really easy.
---
Xbox one, I can’t stay connected for more than 3 minutes without getting booted.
---
W.t.f.
---
Hard reset everything on my end, no difference.
---
&gt; They hate color blind people too.
---
I bet you were able to mostly workaround color blind problems back in FO4 and such where we could adjust the colors of our own UI eh? Those sure were the days. I'm sure there are still other problems, but that was a nice accessibility feature we lost.
---
Wow 
---
Kinda would be cool to use this to trade some of my low level friends some gauss stuff 
---
Wonder how they did that
---
Could take 10. Just keep taking until it pops.
---
Bloodied was cut by half. I can try posting the chart a PTS player released, but for a rough idea bloodied is about 2x as much dmg as a standard food build(a build with no dmg dealing perks). Every other weapon was nerfed to a degree and is somewhere within that range. 
---
Judging by recent PTS comments though, running bloodied for some of the new content like colossal problem will be next to impossible due to needing below 20% to deal more damage than some other strong builds. While it’s still going to be good, I wouldn’t assume it’s going to still be the best until the combat is actually released.
---
No problem! They are pretty cool in a gross way. 😂
---
I had to yank all the unyielding armor out of my stash and irradiate myself until I could carry the weapons I couldn't afford to drop. I never go full unyielding because despite enjoying the perks I hate being a glass cannon, especially if only for carry weight.
---
Raise the scrip limit ffs. These events should make you want to play more, not force you to play less.
---
i hear ya..esp w everyone unloading all they got in close quarters
---
Absolutely hated it when I was doing it, but in retrospect, one of the cleverest quests in the franchise.
---
If i had to guess, its like... cartoon character. I dunno. Just know that people mean character when they say Toon
---
I ran it once on Xbox, def frame rate issues but respawned immediately and was able to head back down and rejoin the fight.
---
Guy is very spungy, burned through 2k .50 ammo and another bunch of fusion cores
---
I would just print it out my self, it can't be that hard.  Murder all the robots and just print my own id
---
😊❤️❤️
---
I placed a mounted wendigo just above the headboard of my bed.
---
Imagine waking up to that.....
---
I dunno what happened, and if you're on console or not, but my partner and I realized that Pacifist mode suddenly turned itself off recently on Xbox. I had this same problem as a result, as without pacifist on, you take a teensy bit of damage when being attacked. Turned it back on, right as rain. 
---
Would be cool if my settings just stayed... well... set?
---
5 not limit, just limit to weapon damage gained
---
No worries and yeah I got it as well but have been wanting the regular mascot heads to fit with my vault tec themed camp
---
Because it's Meat Week
---
It's can actually be quite polite. Just stay out of the major cities.
---
damage it more
---
It's a Bloodied melee character. Most damage reduction perks, along with a bunch of endurance perks. Sorry not really specific.
---
Hahaha that's made my day 👍
---
That's just compensation for all the autocomplete bugs denying people their score.
---
Right?!   I've never recorded anything, but now I'm going to start.    I could see the Yau Guai's eye looking at me as he teetered over the cliff.
---
wow, cool
---
Giving the Prime Meat to the event nets you extra scrip when the event is over. That’s it.
---
That's some self control right there. I cant say I wouldn't have  tried to pick one up, out of curiosity alone.
---
If u get a plan reward a cursed weapon doesn’t usually drop from my runs.   
---
So far all my earl drops have been 1* and all event rewards have been decent 3*.
---
I don't know. I finished last week, and I'm glad to have a break, and not drop everything when Line in the Sand, Rad Rumble, or Guided Meditation shows up.
---
BSS unarmed. (in front of him. click, click, click, H, click, click, click, H, click... done)
---
What platform are you ?
---
Around 1000 should be the current level of legit 8 hours a day grinders.
---
There was also the god mode exploit recently(now presumably patched),that helped someone speed up their levelling.
---
Wow. I’m not a specific build and don’t have near enough ammo to throw out.  Maybe this one’s not for me...
---
Ok I understand. I guess that makes sense
---
You can store your unwanted legendaries on an alt and get another 150 scrip because it's a different character. All characters you make will have their own 150 scrip limit per day. Then when a sale comes..........gogogogogogogo.
---
I know they’re not that good anyways
---
I just want to know how to escape...everyone ran server lagged i got lost...entrance is blocked sohow do you escape?
---
and if the bug of the event not showing but you can still get in and start
---
how do you get back in??
---
Two shot bullets do 62.5% damage each, not 100% and 25%. Accuracy and recoil penalty affect both bullets. And OP is talking about how amount of bullets fired increases the effective rate of fire (not the dps like 25%ffr), and he is right about that. Same thing can be seen with explosive weapons, they too effectively hit twice with one trigger pull and can be used to hit the 200 fire rate needed to see those magic weapons shine.
---
"A Gatling gun with 25% faster fire rate would out DPS it in most instances." - In all situations, but by tiny amount. And if you go and try to calculate all the misses caused by two shot negative effects then alot more.
---
Conversely I fucking *LOVE* that quest. Even in the apocalypse the DMV still sucks
---
Cripple the heads and legs. If you're stealth it's not really an issue. Just watch out for damage over time and the falling ceiling.
---
I think they filmed that movie right next door to Maximum Overdrive ;)    and at the same time.
---
As long i know u can't put anything in this colectron. I Hope is not another dupe shit
---
i had a blast doing that quest, i was laughing so hard.
---
I just quit out on A Colossal Problem - I was able to take his health down, and he mutated, then I took it down to half all solo. Then a bad fear attack at the wrong time lead to my death. When I jumped back down that mine, he was full health again, including the need to make him mutate again. If the game wants to cheat me like that I’m fucking off out. But you’re absolutely fine running Bloodied as long as you remain aware of your surroundings.
---
Grinding exp is your best bet. If you can tolerate it. I get a fair amount passively but s glitched "line in the sand" event can't easily trigger it 2-4 times.
---
The TS effect does "double" your effective fire rate, angryturtle has touched on this in testing that TS does double your fire rate in the mathematical sense. It only makes a big difference though if the gun has 100+ fire rate to begin with.
---
Which is it: are they lazy, or busy jerking each other off? C'mon man, if you're gonna be belligerent, at least be logical.
---
I also had this happen to me on XBox. Unfortunately, finding out the hard way also included them taking out the rest of my crew after they took me out at the SBQ fight.
---
Just to be clear - I have no horse in this. I was just replying to the original suggestion that we should blame Bethesda - I disagree. If players are using exploits then you blame the players...if it isn't fixed then you blame Bethesda.
---
I believe it was said you can't blame the players doing it. Yes you absolutely blame the players. They are the ones using the exploits, it's their decision blame them. 
---
If Bethesda doesn't fix the issue then you absolutely blame them for that.
---
I just hate seeing people saying things like "you can't blame them"...it's like having someone break the law and say you can't blame them for whatever reason. Yes you do blame them. 
---
Please note - I am in no way excusing Bethesda...they REALLY need to get these bugs cleaned up and get their act in gear getting all of these issues fixed. Just don't blame then for miserable scum players.
---
As someone who used to play games with end game bosses this feels way more like one. Personally I like the death timers get long too if you keep dying there should be a penalty. As well I've done it 3 times with barely any lag then normal and a lot less then the SBQ and I have the first 500gb PS4.
---
Was this documented somewhere regarding mannequins coming? I must have missed this, but I'm here for it.
---
There's an exit that opens after the event
---
Makes sense. I don't know about Daily Ops but for Primal Cuts I've been having success with Junkie's Unarmed build with a heavy weapon to finish off the Alpha boss.
---
For Daily Ops I may try a Junkie's heavy weapons power armor build.
---
I hated it but damn I respected it
---
1. I just finished the Season, so I would rather be spending my time playing some other games as a pallet cleanset 
---
2. I’d rather do meat week
---
3. None of the rewards look that interesting
---
Thats the point
---
For the not so creepy but pretty cool category.   Radioactive pumpkin seeds look cool in a display.
---
Nipple suit. Can’t unsee.
---
If you are arriving at the event "every time within a minute", and also are aware of the timing of those events, but choose to get online and bitch about it, that's entirely on you for being too unobservant or lazy to be there on time.
---
Your snarky reply pretty much confirms your hostile 'looking for a fight' personality, so there's nothing else to say.
---
I hate all the original quests in this game, did you know they don’t have npcs?
---
lazy to fix the game, busy jerking each other off. they care more about circle jerks than the game
---
Just because people disagree with you doesn’t mean they didn’t read it. 
---
You said you didn’t like how it ‘forced’ you to play a certain way. 
---
I told you that you’re not being forced to do anything; the challenges are ***optional***.
---
Anyone want to run this with me? Xbox.  VocalLaser7201
---
where is it? I just ran it for the 1st time
---
and how do you get back in with the bug?
---
Gauss mini gun? Da huh?
---
Also pc?
---
If you combine the resort statues with mounted heads, you can create some pretty creepy stuff.
---
Place the statue with no head on the floor back against a wall as close as it can go. Stick a mounted head as close to it as possible so it clips. Pick up the statue and if you’ve done it right, the head will come with. Can I recommend the fox and the bloatfly heads.
---
is fallout 76 a good game? I stooped playing months ago. I'm not giving them any more of my time now. except on here sadly
---
Yes, I can explain:
---
The glitch auto-completes your daily challenges. This has been widely known for weeks now. Being online when the reset happens seems to exacerbate the issue. Also widely known for weeks. Happens to many people on a daily basis. No known cause, no fix possible.
---
I noticed that too. If I start playing one of the drums a few minutes before the event starts, I'll hear the contribution ping but I don't see the event status. I have to dismount the drums for it to recognize I'm in the area.
---
I can’t find ANYONE wanting to run this on PS4. Been on about 7 servers 🤷‍♂️
---
That quest was in the vanilla game, it wasn't recently added 
---
For the record it's supposed to be satire, the Grafton Mare is an awful uh "person" and a caricature of the worst aspects of capitalism affecting politicians 
---
Also If it makes you feel any better, the "protesters" you're tasked to kill aren't actually protesters 
---
Well, they definately used to be! But now they've been infected with scorched plague and are basically just attacking everything that isn't themselves with whatever they can find on hand 
---
In this case they just had the protest signs nearby lol
---
No for real, the game has most cases of protesters in the moral right, they just never were able to achieve what they should have been able to achieve, and then the bombs hit 
---
I don't really follow you on the racist music :/ but then again I don't normally play with the radio on
---
You either have to make some (hard) choices, and dump a bunch of stuff to get under the weight limit, or 
---
do the same thing I do - do the event when you can.  
---
If you are too far away, not much choice other than go about whatever your were doing, wait until you are fortunate enough for it to start when you are within reasonable running distance :)
---
🙀🙀🙀
---
I hadn’t even thought of this because I still don’t have those statues and not a clue how to get them lol
---
It used to happen in a spot near Berkely springs station. and sometimes it happenes to me when I FT to my camp, but it doesn't kill me and I eventually spawn back into my camp.
---
Got him on the first try in about 35 minutes, most levels 100-200. I was the only one running heavy weapons most were commandos.
---
It’s tough but the spawns go down quick and having 2 people focus on those was really helpful
---
chicken shit devs decided to leave that bug in instead of fixing it despite having a week (i know theres been other times its happened but its become more apparent with this update)
---
This price check is a god send. Bless the being who made this a thing
---
This should be a loading screen tip!
---
Must be a pretty good circle jerk then. Get yours, Bethesda team. Respect.
---
Yeah ACP was one of the reasons why I'm considering switching. No way I can run bloodied in that event.
---
He was glitching thru the roof for me... Twice. Not so epic.
---
It's out?
---
Lol yes I eat nearly all my food at once just to make sure it’s full and drink way too many purified waters at once. Then I wonder why I’ve no food left.
---
Yeah i always make sure to keep up well-fed and well-hydrated.  Always keep food and water in mt favorites wheel.
---
I guess the 3 OP rifles that were already in the game weren't good enough for you. If only they added a Gauss rifle...
---
Sneak Damage Multiplier. If you play Sneak, you can do heckin damage
---
Page one of the Survival Guide.
---
Wouldn't it be Agri-Armor as it is in America, we don't have the "u" in armor here.
---
I would be careful though i somehow did some damage to a guys camp using an explosive weapon. The explosive damage was slowly widdling down the walls and stuff so i stopped once i noticed that the walls were actually taking damage dropped a sorry emote and left
---
We beat him on the second go but not by much. The first go i bluescreened and couldn't get back into the mine.
---
When we beat him I'd just died and was on a 40 second cooldown, and when i did respawn kept respawning into the nuke zone outside and dying before i could fast travel out. It did give me the event rewards though
---
You don't get back in with the bug.  The whole mine is so dimly lit I can never find anything.  Just look for an exit sign like you would find in a modern building with glowing red letters.
---
Oh for gods sake
---
I think some people can’t handle a difference of opinion. 
---
Ifyou don’t see the point in the activity, then don’t engage in the activity.  The challenges are optional content.
---
And just because *you* have to alter the way you play doesn’t mean other people do. I kill Super Mutants, Mole Miners and Glowing creatures as part of my everyday gameplay. I find Bobbleheads all the time. I build mini-structures in workshops often; I even have a blueprint that resolves 80% of one of the weekly build challenges, as well as the daily versions.  It also happens to have all I need in a ‘mini-camp’ for a workshop. Takes me about five seconds to drop it, and then I can move on. 
---
Last week, I tested a theory, about how long it actually takes to complete the daily challenges. 
---
**It took less than five minutes.**
---
So, sure, you might have to ‘alter the way you play’ for five minutes.  
---
So what?  Either spend that time to get the challenges done, or do something else. 
---
Before SCORE, these were to generate Atoms. Did you complain about having to ‘alter how you played’ then?
---
Me?  I’d rather not have to dress in a Fasnacht Mask and Responder Gear and be wielding a Musical Instrument when I level up to get 20 Atoms. It’s a **LOT** better to just ‘level up’ and be done with it.
---
You complain that it forces you to change how you play, then you say you want the challenges to be ‘more intricate’. 
---
More intricate challenges would impose a greater requirement to alter how you play. 
---
*So which is it?  Should the challenges conform to how you currently play, or should they be more intricate and complicated than they currently are?*
---
I think you are supposed to.
---
If it was 100% with 3 misses, then yeah bad code. 100 misses at 95% is perfectly acceptable.
---
But yeah, it was just a throwaway line at best lol
---
Been here since beta, no use in blaming the player base. there used to be far less hacks when PvP was a thing. Bethesda chose to use the creation engine, the one that players have been modding since fallout 3. Shit still has leftover code from Morrowind. Players got bored with their inability to grief because we were sold on the idea this was going to be Fallout Rust. Then Bethesda bait and switched us. If a player is cheesing or griefing, I really don't blame them. Bethesda needs to fix their stuff or hire people who can. Give us a server mode like survival.
---
Yeah, honestly, between the two options, I know what I'm gonna pick every time.
---
see the thing is, i try games even with bad rep, this game is really fucking good despite all the bugs. but come-on , its the devs fault that this game has such bad rep.
---
Voult raids are not in game anymore. But with vault steel and legendary modules you can craft the gear wich came from raids. But you must first buy the plans from the gold merchant wich you get access by completing wastelanders questline.
---
great game, you've missed out on a lot.
---
I finally sold out of my Faschnacht decorations and I'm slowly selling out my masks. Regular masks are 222, the rare ones are 500. I have people buy them all the time and I have so many since people dropped the dupes and I scooped them up. Basically just free income and some people feel stylish.
---
Snarky reply? What the hell are you talking about? You're the only one here being aggressive. If you misunderstood something, maybe learn to read and comprehend first.
---
I feel exactly the same way. I like this game, and I love the people I've met while playing it. But Bethesda continues to have problems that the community makes them aware of over and over and over that don't get fixed. Auto-completed SCORE challenges, the disappearing legendary corpses, tagging a legendary creature but not getting a legendary weapon, the respawn bug... It's just getting ridiculous. Then if you consider how unfriendly this game is towards secondary characters (I refuse to grind raider and settler rep on a second character), and the way that veteran players are going to be penalized in the upcoming legendary perk card system, it just kind of makes you wonder if they care at all about their existing player base.
---
Just be glad people have stopped saying "paper doll", that was by far the most annoying term for a player character I've ever heard.
---
You can also just loot the wendigo spawns and it will bump you out when the timer runs out with no consequence. Just be careful you don't die from falling debris.
---
It’s back to under armour. I’m pretty annoyed they changed it back. Especially after giving us a beret to wear with them. I think more people wanted it as an outfit that they did an under armour.
---
No but I need to have 40 stimpacks/radaway/radx/purified water or more, if not I have to buy some. I know I don't need that many but its something odd I pay attention to lol. Also the canning idea would be really cool, I know they have a backpack mod that extends food life but it wouldn't hurt to add different methods for food preservation.
---
Shotguns sucked and pistols sucked, so they got a semi decent drop in new weapons. Everyone was already using handmades and fixers so they didn't need anything in that area.
---
Bethesda should look into an emote for this. They could charge 1000 atoms and it would still sell like hotcakes.
---
What's the sentinel effect? Edit : looked it up I see. Does crouching negate that?
---
I’ve had this for ages. I used to always get blue screen and crash but that’s hardly happening now, just the black screen.
---
Yeah black screened my first event exiting the mine too. Second event went better.
---
I love it. It's the most accurate thing in game.
---
there are no more vault raids. modules are needed to create the weapons and armor you get from buying plans with gold bullion.
---
Exactly. Ive had a CCP for decades. Never pulled it except target practice.
---
I'd like to know as well
---
You lose out on the chest at the end though.
---
Best side quest in the game
---
Thank you I hope it works next time!
---
Sort of, but not entirely sure how the game engine factors it in. Each shot/round would have to have a separate hit/damage calculation done for it, but whether that is considered 2x the fire rate is questionable. Getting to what you're probably asking about, can this be used to invoke the "magic" effect (with fire rate &gt; 200), I'm not sure... I do know that explosive weapons (also register as 2 calculations per round) can bring about the magic effect on large enemies (other than the SBQ - immunity)
---
Why would you want one? Charging weapons have terrible dps, miss in vats and have expensive ammo.
---
Ah okay. I'm out of them now :(
---
Just tried it for the first time on Xbox and the frame rates and lag were sooooooooo slow. I was trapped in a glass case of emotion the whole time. Couldn’t help the other players at all. Everything I tried to do on my controller was 10 seconds behind. I see why they were holding off on releasing it
---
I like it when they tunnel 2km away to a player that was laggy while fast-travelling to join the event, never to be heard or seen again and causing the event to fail after wave 4 is clear.
---
So fun.
---
If they don't want to deal with a possible lawsuit from 2K games, I could see them having the Industrial hand from the Settlers attached to the Power Armor as a just buzzsaw hand. They could also instead add in that Steel Saw or Auto Axe into the game instead and slap it onto the power armor.
---
That's the point.
---
Exit is to the right of the big ass drill in the wall. Yellow lights will flash! Heck, run out once for the end chest (ore, stims, caps) its fun and exciting. Other times, stay and loot the spawns you kill and let the mine collapse on you. You will keep everything you loot and be teleported out of the mine (into a nuke zone, fyi!) and rewarded event loot!
---
ETA: If you die while looting you will (hopefully - no bugged respawn for you) respawn outside the mine as the event is still going so DON'T LEAVE until you get the completion - if you get stuck outside mid event STAY THERE and at least get event loot!
---
What I just saw scrap/store collectron station. Locks will not stop that kind of glitch
---
Uh yah it's a major aspect of most of the games worldbuilding 
---
I mean the mole miners were all abused workers who were protesting just for safe working conditions, and the fact they were never given these conditions is what led to the way things are now 
---
If you're just running around doing the event quests, maybe it will fly over your head, because those event quests are mostly having to do with dealing with problems that were created just now
---
While side missions, misc objectives, and main story missions usually have much more to do with what's already happened and why. Things will be more clear if you get more into those 
---
Also try hearing to Harper's Ferry, there's a vendor bot there with some hilariously relevant lines that can apply to the situation today, for real he woke af 
---
Also look into the Free States movement in-game if you see that name pop up
---
Not bothered about the walls its only wood and have plenty of wood
---
Best mission in the game lol it felt so real.
---
Someone prowlin round 'ere!
---
Ya, you have to be standing
---
That be more Pay 2 Win than this game already is
---
Fucking hell, some of the shit on that sub lol.
---
***Disclaimer: The link provided is not for the faint of heart lol***
---
It's a bloodied pistol build with a gauss pistol
---
In the weekly challenges there's a challenge to complete 10 daily ops and it shows you how many you've done.
---
179 screws in one run and i didnt start killing windgos until all my heavy weapons were out of ammo...... ive never had more then 100 in total
---
I can't see the idea of a drill on a hand could result in a lawsuit.  I'm sure we can go back and find instances of drills being used as weapons in games before Bioshock.
---
Wasnt only the walls though it damaged everything in the room the vendors and wall decorations too
---
This response will NEVER not be funny.
---
Mutation you get from a serum. The reason you see characters bounding all over the place. You can buy them from player vendors sometimes.
---
TBH magic weapons didn’t enter my mind. I just like fast fire rate guns and I was wondering if my 227 fire rate Gatling laser can effectively hit 454. Hahaha.
---
lol good to see post like this that doesn’t do anything but complain. Instead discuss what is happening in detail so others can help you
---
That wasn’t it. People can’t even damage you if you’re not initiated into pvp with them, either you were in pvp meaning it was in fact your fault or you were starving/thirsty/there was an enemy or you were poisoned, meaning once again it wasn’t their fault
---
Xbox here and I just joined my first event. Worst lag and frame rates I have ever seen. It was unplayable. Everything was 10 seconds behind it felt like
---
I sure hope so! If I have to wait 3 days to play that’s ridiculous.
---
STR benefits melee and PER benefits rifles; IMHO, that's a good combination, as it gives you flexibility.
---
In the low 20's, I had a L20 vampire machete (Serrated or sacrificial blade will add damage), and a scoped hunting rifle.  
---
For speedy kills, a switchblade may do it for you.  Those are relatively frequent drops from the scorched at Collision Course (morgantown airport).  Serrated blade mod adds damage.
---
Might be able to find a BoS rifle in a vendor or a higher level can make one for you.

Semi-autos...you may have a problem keeping them fed.

I managed to do it once with no issues, and no frame rate problems. Then did Meat Week event and during that the frame rate dropped to ridiculous levels. I’m used to it dropping sometimes when there’s plenty going on but it’s sluggish everywhere on the map. Going to restart to see if that helps as it made the subsequent attempts at ACP awful

Dude it's not a competition find a group of people you like playing with and go have fun man. Don't let some game design flaw ruin your experience if it doesn't have to...
---
I think its around 15 pct for each. After a few days they will be everywhere I'd imagine.
---
Are you sure you are actually unlocking something or just getting unlucky
---
Yeah i "accidentally" nutted too, man
---
So why not have the boulders fall later with 1 minute left instead of as soon as he dies so we don’t lose what we worked for hiding in a nice spot and unable to loot the boss?
---
Last time I went to the DMV was to replace my stolen license plate. They charged me $80 for a stolen plate fee.
---
2/10 rant, would not recommend
---
That means your server is old and either is about to crash or go down
---
Midwesterners for the win 🙌🏼
---
On pc they can push updates whenever they want, on console there is a verification process involved per sony or microsoft (they go over it to check if it wont brick your console etc)
---
Im on xbox, it’s happened on a few
---
All my bobby-pins besides 10 disappeared, super weird
---
While that is all the more a possibility, 6 levels of looting and breaking down every weapon and armor i came across and not unlocking anything sounds kinda absurd right? Im talking 13-14 guns a loop 6-8 armor pieces
---
I know about railways I diddnt know about laser rifles
---
Player vendor
---
Pistol build. Dont see those often. 
---
I'm a automatic rifle build
---
Yeah just tried it and can honestly say that it was the first and last time.
---
yw
---
I haven’t watched maximum overdrive in too long.
---
Logging off doesn’t prevent auto completion
---
Yer I only have basic stuff ie o etc of each workshop (not power armour station as haven't found the plan yet) and 3 vendors.
---
you need to drop a nuke on it
---
Dude you're on r/fo76, what do you expect? LOL
---
Nice, you should be in the "magic" zone regardless of effective fire rate then
---
So I'd best try to trade off my new pickaxe by the end of the day
---
I'm thinking "no", but first...which event? Which platform?
---
I haven't run into any laggy events recently.   
---
My Tesla isn't my first choice, but I do pull it out sometimes if the quantity of enemies requires I do so. 
---
Or...if you can't beat 'em, join, 'em?
---
If I saw that, I would message the camp owner and just ask them what's up.
---
It's already been nuked.  The entrance is blocked.
---
Try making a luck group I think it helped me get better odds
---
oh then i have no idea lol
---
Fuck man right in the feels, loved watching this movie with my kids and they're on the other side of the world right now, haven't seen them  since march.im going through Hague convention to get them back but fuck it's been a  rough time without them around 💀
---
I use Super Stims and if I fall below like 40-50 I get nervous lol. I always carry WAY more than I'll ever need haha
---
Yeah if I really need to I'll throw Good With Salt on but it doesn't apply to vendors which sucks, or the backpack mod. There are so really cool recipes I just never bother to make because I won't be able to use them unless maybe I'm running Good With Salt or the backpack mod.
---
Ok.  Tx.
---
Well in fact, this is a named variant with a much higher health pool.
---
You have 4 mins to get in after nuke drops.
---
If the game is shagged the game is shagged. On Xbox all you can do is redownload it and have the same error.
---
I agree, that whole end event mechanic needs to be changed. Just let us finish the event, clean up the piles and exit the mine normally. Give people 3 to 5 minutes and then seal the mine and eject anybody who might still be in there. For the life of me I don't understand why the current system is necessary.
---
No probs 👍
---
On PC they are going for as low as 200-500 caps already
---
Yeah exactly. Like i get haha dmv slow but that shit was painstakingly annoyong.
---
This image makes me führerious
---
If a team leader is in there and has spaces join the team then you can fast travel onto him and join the event.
---
So it is ok for you if a so called "challenge" push you to server hop to find a specific thing? if you prefer to skip event objectives just because you need xp? Building something just  to destroy it right after? It is not about the time it take, nor the fact you can like this or not. It is about the fact most challenges are not streamlined with what the game itself is designed for.
---
You don't see an absurd pattern here? are you just ok to accept every lazy content from Bethesda? (man, if yes, they are right: why bother if people accept everything)
---
Also  we should call "challenge": "task", because they are not challenging at all.
---
Stealth and PA builds seem to still work well there, but it’s something I’ve been trying to figure out myself. I don’t think it warrants acting to quickly outside of making sure you have enough perk points to switch if needed, but most the people saying bloodied is the new meta haven’t looked at a lot of the math so far. While bloodied will still be much stronger than most builds, it’s going to be much harder to maintain when you can’t one-shot enemy swarms or are put up against heavy dmg dealers like warlord super mutants or colonel gutsy’s with more health. If dying had any major downside like it does in most mmo’s, I don’t think we’d see many ppl stay bloodied for the dmg nerf.
---
I’m sure I’ll get hate for having that opinion though lol
---
Why wouldn’t you take any? I would’ve taken all of it unless any of it was impossible gear, like modded with bean splitters or more than 3 effects
---
Power armour station plans are a reward from a quest, that’s your only chance of grabbing it and it’s not exactly the easiest quest
---
"But only for Handmades and Assault Rifles, it works for everythign else."
---
I tried.   It must have been full.
---
my friend was able to lag out but his character stayed in the floor cooking station animation (pot and ladle) and it looked like he was right infront of me jerkin me off
---
HAHAHA good one!
---
This happened to me first time I tried this event. I died when Earle did and couldn't respawn for like 25 seconds. I missed out on looting entirely and it spawned me outside the mine. Not a strong first impression. Loot: Gone in 60 seconds.
---
It's definitely a good bit easier than the SBQ health wise, but each hit does less damage. He has an 80% DI in addition to 400/400/500 DR. My bloodied handmade was able to do about 120 damage if I got close enough, remained in stealth, and got a headshot. Normal hit was around 20-40.
---
scanning...scanning........s c a n n i n g
---
Good info ty 👍
---
 
---
Any form of crime to do with murder of pretty much any kind usually just comes down to a bad egg being involved anyway. There’s plenty of disciplined, respectful folk on this earth who’d have a hard time bringing harm to any form of life.
---
I hope this thread doesn’t turn into some heavily debated pro gun/anti gun debate.
---
I’m Australian, we have firearms as well. Not that we openly carry or concealed carry, but we still have the access to licensing, storage in our homes, the ability to take them on the range or use them in rural areas on private property.
---
When it comes down to it, if someone was going to lose the plot and act out of line if it weren’t a gun, it’d be a knife, or a car, or a bomb, the list really goes on.
---
I’m not a pro nut nor am I against them. They serve their purpose, they’re tools, much like anything the wielder just needs to respect them and the lives around themselves. Anywho it’s 4:40am here! I am off to have a snooze.
---
Hope everyone has a wonderful day! (:
---
I definitely killed me, although it took a second or two to hit the bottom. It did however respawn me at my C.A.M.P. even though atlas is nowhere near my C.A.M.P
---
That's a Wendigo Collossus, not Earle Williams.
---
The Wendigo Colossus event, and its not the servers. Theres a bug with teslas right now that causes serious lag ever since Patch 21 was released. Even the PvP community stopped usuing teslas because of the lag. Now that's saying something. Im not saying dont yse it ever again, im saying just stash it until they fix the lag issue. I dont see how thats too big of a deal that someone just can't not use a tesla in large mob fights. I dont even own a tesla and have never felt the need to acquire one.
---
I did it everyday except one and on that day all my challenges auto completed. The one and only time the entire season... on the day I didnt log out...
---
They will try to kill you, kill them back
---
I have and they are often looted, especially on challenge days. You know what doesn’t help. Your weak sass
---
I've tried twice today and failed both. I am now out of stimpacks and ammo. Not enough players helping out (3 including myself both runs).
---
Too many Chally heads and barbecue outfits...
---
I actually just Googled the lyrics to every song and I have no clue lol
---
I'm actually curious which one you're talking about, not wanting to get involved in debate, just interested in hearing a new perspective!
---
Am I missing something? Am I going to the wrong event LOL! The one I went to yesterday only had one drum and cave crickets. I’m going to need to hop back on this afternoon and see about this!!
---
no idea all i can say is it works for me. you may not be giving camera enough rotation speed.
---
There script fodder now.
---
It took me about 15 medx to get addicted.
---
Literally just happened to me. Died one second after Earle died, and it respawned me outside of the mine. Couldnt loot anything. Feels bad.
---
They have something like that in the works pretty sure it’s a daily ops reward
---
On PC, this event sucked until I picked up a magic shotgun. Now Wendigo heads go pop. Can't buy enough shotgun ammo from player vendors to sustain this carnage.
---
I bought that bundle but the jumpsuits were a waste imo. I'd prefer Nuka Cola wallpapers and other stuff instead.
---
For King and Country! 
---
For the Kingdom!
---
Yeah, ive already decided not to be playing fo76 by then. Im currently just coasting until the new POE league launches.
---
Ill probably just leave all my gear scattered around over a few servers then kill all my chars. I have 10k unspent atoms too. Its a shame i cant give them away.
---
Ikr the Brahmin did nothing wrong
---
Been here since beta - Bethesda doesn't make the players find glitches and hacks. They don't force players to use them. 
---
Scummy players chose to use hacks and cheats, use glitches to ruin things for others. It's entirely their fault.
---
If Bethesda doesn't fix an issue when it comes up then it's their fault and we absolutely should hold them accountable. 
---
Until then though it's too easy to just let players off the hook for their own crap behaviour...no one blames the player base...you blame the crap players for their actions. Let's not start letting their bad behaviour off the hook- make them take responsibility for their actions. Just as we should make Bethesda take responsibility for anytime they don't fix a problem when it's found.
---
It’s funny but then it’s not because you realize the entire main quest is bad for the same reasons it’s funny bad except the main quest isn’t funny
---
I might take Furious above it.
---
There is always different things to do.
---
For me they are useful on my stealth builds.
---
Pretty much that entire vertical stretch of OK, KS, NE, SD, and ND is this way. I have family that live on the coasts that are very surprised with the general politeness of people in this region. They're weirded out when someone says hello and makes small talk when waiting outside a restaurant in Omaha, but that's just every day life here.
---
Say what you want about he lack of things to do on the plains... but damn the people make it feel like home. *Much* easier to make friends with friendly people.
---
What guns and armor
---
About how many levels per slot?
---
Yep the timer really needs to go for this one, either that or cap it at 15 or 20 seconds max
---
Correction.  YOU made it feel like a part time job.   This is a 100% voluntary leisure activity.  If you want to have the mentality of "I NEED TO COMPLETE THIS PASS" and you stress out over it in any way, that's 100% on you dude.
---
I just don't understand why people think they HAVE to complete everything.  You don't.  lol.
---
when in a full server, vault 76 or the cabin below are still a slight run off from the event. Teleporting there, I've still missed a few events. It's not the end of the world, but annoying.
---
Blame the people crying that they needed it released. There were quite of bit of YouTube videos of people complaining that it was not released and demanded it to. Then they start complaining that it’s bugged up.
---
It’s funny how people’s minds work.
---
I feel you man. Stay positive. My son is blind and we love to listen and sing to this movie sometimes:)
---
When me and my wife played that part, she was mad af and i was dying laughing. Different types of humor i guess.. Gotta lighten up a little bit. Playing video games in general could be considered a waste of time. They made a brilliant joke, and they were dedicated to it. I applaud them.
---
Same! Still got 2 cursed shovels though
---
Not sure about regurlar but Explosive lasers do, and as you know they pack a punch lol, it's funny when someone's stealthboy runs out and you crit em with a legacy and fire them a mile in the sky
---
This is exactly how I feel. I was so upset when 76 came out and it was so disappointing. I felt really betrayed and was pissed. But I've recently started playing it and with the new update with NPCs, I've enjoyed it more than some of the other Fallout games. I absolutely love Fallout and I think that a love for Fallout is almost required to really love this game.
---
It was funny for about the first 3 minutes after getting in there but then it became painful
---
I use mine in events with a lot of little guys, and Queen spawns...never noticed anything. I've only done 1 Colossus so far, but used my .50 cal mostly. 
---
I'm about to jump on now and play for the next couple hours, so I'll keep an eye on it, but I've been using it a bunch recently to try and blow through my fusion cells...I'll (try to) be courteous if I see anything.
---
I landed in a dead server for the event. Me and 2 other people doing other things. Server hopped again and thought to myself "Wait, I should've checked vendors!"
---
Yep same
---
You need legendary modules to craft the weapons and armors you buy with gold bullion.
---
I’ve had no problems and the best rewards come from just completing the event
---
Not at all...its great having over 150k caps and a butt-fuck ton of items
---
That also works on/after exiting to double dip the event :-)
---
Did you add a paint job to it? If so, remove that and then you should be able to sell it at the legendary exchange machine.
---
With all the sneak dmg boosting though is it really needed
---
Meat pile plan &amp;  collasus head plan! Brother got two miner helmets:(
---
Your argument doesn’t explain how it sucks...
---
My instigating sniper destroys pretty much any enemy.
---
Just wondering y u dying so easily
---
Turn on pacifist
---
Has it got any paint ? You should be able to get rid of it if it’s back to it’s base state
---
We have a country full of guns so the communist will think twice to invade and if our government become oppressive tyrants. Oh wait they already are...
---
 When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty.

Nice Camp!
---
One question thou, how do you make that with the glass dome?
---
What does it say when you're at the legendary exchange machine?
---
can you trade legendary modules between characters?
---
That's fair. One day I played for 3 hours straight and not a single Meat Cook event triggered. Alllllll my prime meat spoiled =(

Updated
---
I died to a wave of wendigos after earl died and didnt spawn back into the event, meaning I lost event rewards. I really should have spawned back in there
---
Wish I got those plans!
---
Bad server
---
100% right. The daily/weekly issue and inability to respawn have been my two plagues. The auto completion is what lead me to stop doing dailies/weeklies when it was for atoms. I buy a lot of atoms so those were a discount program. It wasn't worth checking every day to see nothing.
---
I really hope things get cleaned up. I also hope modded servers are truly modded servers. I want to see community fixes, community tools. That's when this game will explode for me. In the mean time my drive for every rare outfit and plan will keep me.xoming back.
---
There haven’t been vault raids in the game for 4 months.
---
Pure luck. 130 levels of mediocre weapons. I don't know whether it was purveyor or world drop, but I just got a magic shotty that seems to instagib anything I point at its head. Two shots to the face. Eat shit Mirelurk King!
---
if they are not gonna play, your best option is to also do nothing and deny them the rewards
---
Colossas.
---
Shielded underarmor was a no brainer (melee build), but the rest  is where I have a similar problem - getting comparable perks on SS armor.
---
I'm running 5 pieces of deep pocketed 3\* WR armor (1 each for junk, ammo, aid, weapons), one chameleon and one with poison resistance, 2 add +1 to different perks; 330 DR, but low RR (partially due to my high capacity backpack)
---
My first SS rolls were 3\* chest, 3x2\* and a 1\* limbs.  None WR.  Good DR, but can't compete with the carry weight.
---
For as long as it took Mrgph to bestow the set I have now, I don't want to think about how many legendary modules I may have to buy to get similar SS....
---
This guy’s just built different
---
I'm going to rip the eyes out of your head and piss in your dead skull!!!....you fucked with the wrong AFK'er!!!
---
I see no solutions with players taking responsibility for their actions. In the moral sense what you are saying is correct, but in reality that's not feasible. There is no hook, they get off Scott free 97% of the time
---
Why do you have to sound like a Karen when you complain?
---
I tried it a month in, hated it, ignored it for a year,  grabbed it on the game pass, and now I’m hooked. The first 20 levels are frustrating, but now that Ive figured out about half the systems. I’m enjoying it a bunch. 
---
I think that not being there when they added a lot of the content let me skip a lot of the day one  bugs for those updates. It was pretty empty/boring before the additions though.
---
Something I do to myself is on me, something that someone else does is on them.   
---
Didn't ruin their friendship, and he was being malicious I told him not to and he did it. As for ratting him out to his dad, yep sure did. And the dad knows I was banned once we were laughing about it when it happened and he was banned the next day. You don't know the neighborhood dynamic here so there you go.
---
What the heck?  It's the apocalypse, what do you expect?
---
Huntin rifles, leather armor, metal armor, combat shotguns, some melee things etc, i havent seen any notifications pop up in that yellow text not even just the unlockable stuff, like when i pickup anything it doesnt tell me like Stimpak (2) added anymore or none of that
---
I find the right hand meat spit likes to bug out for me. I try to leave and get stuck standing there for 30 seconds.
---
Use a magic heavy weapon, you don't have to ruin the event for everyone by killing the colossus instantly. You just keep the health steadily dropping so people aren't overwhelmed by the wendigo spawns when his health drops. 5-8 minutes is a really safe goal for everyone to hit the minimum damage and then you can go into the execution. I've carried low levels with pipe rifles this way and they get loot. The event needs tuning and magic/legacy weapons should be gone, but that's not going to happen soon so it's the best option for now.
---
If you are doing this event and insist on bloodied then go to half health at least. (Power armor is also an option)
---
Here are a few things that may help if you can fit them in:
---
   \-First have Fireproof maxed out for raining ceiling damage.
---
   \-Secondly have blocker for wendigo spawns.
---
   \-Lastly a scorchbeast heart with carnivore can net you eight endurance which could help with your survivability.
---
Other than those just watch your HP bar as much as you can. The ceiling falling in can be hard to read and/ or suddenly appear over you. I personally play as if the floor is lava and watch it as much as I can between the Wendigo Colossus fire &amp; poison as well as the ceiling falling in.
---
I never said it couldn’t be related, I’m just saying that it doesn’t always prevent it. It’s happened to tons of people even when they logged out
---
First attempt disconnected from server, 2nd attempt success..
---
With a decent sized team with a selection of good weapons it is fun.. only died 3 times!
---
Try this look at what u have unlocked for a weapon and then find like ten of them. Scrap them and see if anything is unlocked
---
Unfortunately they gated it behind you dropping a nuke and have a few minutes.  Sadly,  I find the Silo's to not be much fun and waste of time. 10000's of nukes dropped on Queen, and they couldnt' think of a different way to do this :(  :(  I wouldnt' even care if dropping nukes was used for it, but give us a different way to drop them, other than the same old boring Silo's.  Now before I do something fun, I have to waste 20 minutes for the bazzillionth time...  They should allow me to trigger from Camp for $10k caps or something that doesn't make me do that same tired old run again
---
Its greatly appreciated. Its typically more of an issue wheres there's tons of enemy spawns. Im pretty sure I've seen people mention having this problem at radiation rumble a few times if memory serves. But yea, it can get pretty bad if thats all someones uses. Im sure a few clips here and there isn't a problem, its when you start getting 5 or 6 mags out in one area.
---
There’s a list somewhere of what can be unlocked and how.
---
Stoner adventure bro's unite!!
---
permanent, which is why everybody freaking out over it has been hilariously ridiculous.
---
I did this quest before I went to a DMV for the first time. I gotta say it took less time than the real DMV, both were emotionally draining on my soul tho
---
he was.
---
I agree. Screw farming is stupidly easy now
---
That I dont know.
---
that’s pretty much like everything that happens to me when I go to the dmv
---
haha thanks
---
This is the Rule 34 content we need.
---
It's called Fallout 1st because you pay to get there first ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I liked all of them, but didn't know there was a bundle. Rip my atoms 😒
---
Idk what to tell you, I died at the end as well spawned me outside but I was still in the event it lasts a few min after.
---
You misspelled Nuke. Nuke Charleston, it will make you feel better  :)
---
I did that already with brass knuckles and a combat knife and still have been doing it with hunting rifles, like my quest rewards arent even popping up in the top left hand corner, i think i turned off notifications or tool tips or something and dont know how to turn it back on
---
Launched my first on Saturday. I’d killed the queen before but never started the event myself. Launched at site prime and quickly fast traveled to watch the fireworks. I arrive and see that I’m just in the blast zone. I’m thinking “ I’m only just in the zone. I should be fine”
---
Famous last words
---
Oh okay that's what I thought. Thank you for the quick response!
---
Welp they released a game that was still broken wouldn't put anything past the move literally have been stuck in a respawn screen twice after dying and had to force close app both times to get back to what I was doing.
---
Would you recommend going in shotgun or heavy I've got magic shotguns and decent heavy weapons
---
You need* I didn't ask for this
---
Did you try all kinds of sneaking?  5 pieces of chameleon or weightless, stealth boys, or thorn armor?  It would make sense to nerf how effective regular old unyeilding is for sneaking.
---
If you're a sneak sniper then it's nice.
---
I’m on Xbox! Damn.
---
Bugger
---
So you didn't make the cut?
---
I just completed it for the first time on Xbox. What a battle! I thought it was a lot of fun and didn't have any lag issues, etc. Being a bloodied build I died several times, but that's ok. It felt like a great boss event. The long respawn after you die kind of sucks but I suppose that's a fair penalty for death. Just wanting to get back in there and kick some ass so the timer is excruciating!
---
Collosal Problem
---
I have it for a humble price of 69 caps: 🙄
---
But for today I have a sale of free: 😒
---
Melee, I forgot. I used melee a great deal climbing up to level 10 and then I just stopped. Thanks. :)
---
What system do you play on?
---
Lol. Brilliant. Well, lesson learned I guess!
---
But you don’t really need it. Odds are you got your sneak perks max and going for a headshot.
---
It's not new - the protest march been in the game since beta (e.g. long before current events).
---
Worker strikes/picketlines/protest have been around for a long time, as have strikebreakers (who have been known to use violence to break the strikes).
---
Not saying it’s useless just not needed on the builds you think would benefit most from it
---
I've never done it so far, where do you get it? And what's the recommended lvl
---
🤣 this guy knows what im talking about. Teslas are so broken right now.
---
I'm not suggesting anything as a solution - blame doesn't solve anything for anyone sadly. 
---
I'm just suggesting that placing the blame for bad player behaviour on Bethesda is putting it in the wrong place.
---
Now - the blame for letting them off the hook, not fixing the issues as they come up etc. THAT I definitely blame on Bethesda.
---
Do you know how much big combines cost ? A new one from John Deere is half a million easy
---
Does prime weapons fair better? I swear I shot him with my junkie high power mini with explode damage and it didn't phase him. Maybe I need a better addiction,  any advice?
---
*looks at previously released content that had many bugs and was broken shrugs and takes a shot*
---
Bethesda in a nutshell
---
Colossal Problem is great to get expensive ammo (ultracite), fiberglass is worth some good caps, the plushie got sound, plus you will never have to farm screws anymore. Great event in my book.
---
Bro legit was raging having to sit there and wait for my number to be called. The fact that they took that shit down to the detail at the end had me laughing but before wanting to murder my neighbor. 
---
"Sorry you number was already called, please take another number and wait in line.... AGAIN"
---
With sneak damage boost and the double it’s a guaranteed one shot on most targets. While others aren’t always. Have you one shotted a 93 Glowing Deathclaw? 
---
If so please share your build. Seriously.
---
It works wonders when you play not as a boss killer but as a mob-controller. Fixer with I/25/25 and Gun Fu with Grim Reaper's Sprint and it gets pretty wild
---
At least we killed the queen after lol
---
It has advantage in terms of net damage output beyond the first shot/ melee strike. For instance, it takes Furious 8 shots to catch up, enemy DR notwithstanding.
---
Neat, I got the reclaimed ,curse harpoon ,cursed shovel, and the plushie plan already.
---
I'm on pc
---
Xbox and I don't do melee hits don't register
---
Yeah, had the same thing happen twice
---
THANKS!
---
People have been begging for different bosses proc'd by nuking since forever.
---
I never asked for the skin to be enabled but yup it's on it. Now I have to figure how to remove it. Thanks.
---
Welcome!
---
So what you're saying is... screw PC, they can deal with the bugs, but they should have been sorted out for consoles? K. 
---
And also, fixing bugs isn't necessarily a simple task, so assuming it could "all be fixed in a week" in ridiculous.
---
Honestly, not too sure. Started as Rifleman, the RnG gods forced me to like Melee with a few godroll fisticuffs, but I've always wanted shotties to be good but they weren't...until this one. I have a few heavy weapons, I think a magic gatling too, but the ammo just isn't worth it to me. Once I realized the immense power I had, I just specced into Gunslinger to get the weight down and Enforcer for the limb cripple. Then I just vats somethings head and poof it's gone. Says it does anywhere from 110-365 damage (unyielding scale on me), but all I see are a cloud of overlapping yellow numbers and pretty much anything except the SBQ, Colossus, and Mirelurk King can survive more than one shot. There are like another 9 perks into the shotgun tree though, so it seems like an expensive build I haven't even delved fully into.
---
I had the exact same problem i thought it was cuz they were some main story quest rewards or something i ended up destroying them
---
Must be nice 😂 I can’t find ANYONE who wants to run silos on PS 😂
---
typically monsters who are 25-50 levels higher then the player are capable of one-shotting them. it is very common. i never said "i" was getting one-shotted by anything taking place in a game that hasn't released the dlc update yet.  meaning it will probably annoy players when random guy walks by and hes street pizza.
---
Screws man! 
---
Seriously though people are silly with farming things they want/need
---
I don't get all the delays and ESPECIALLY on console if you don't fix crap. It's pretty clear at this point that the PTS is used to change gameplay and NOT bugs. Don't delay thing, release them right away and test how it goes. SMH
---
They weren’t even doing that they were at the entrance area of the arena
---
Aaaannnd blocked. Go look for a fight somewhere else, or better yet, resolve your toxic personal issues?
---
America gave the world the Internet and GPS dude... for free
---
You're benefiting from America's politeness. You're welcome.
---
(TCP/IP is the foundation of the Internet and networks in general, it was created by American military research. Tim Berners-Lee only made the Internet easier to browse)
---
I’m ok with two shotting and having a actually useful prefix for fights longer than two shots
---
Welp, nevermind. Dont know then
---
The event is horrible. So much lag on ps4 Pro and everyone dying too easy lol
---
🙄     .. oh man...  I just crafted one too, 🤪  damn.
---
Ah yes I didn't know and I do have healing factor too.
---
What did you expect? I expected 16x the amount of bugs
---
I mean, that's exactly why I loved it hahaha.
---
Was so great to be gutted and eaten by one of the guys that was in the waiting line lol
---
Yeah I have a magic quad double-barrel everything dies in one apart from what you already said and even the other don't take too much to go.
---
If you were Xbox, I could help.  Sorry.
---
Honestly I thought the quest was broken but no holy fuck the wait was long for me
---
Bethesda is all talk and little to no action.
---
Just got to try it for the first time myself,  cant get barely 2 hits in as bloodied melee before I'm dead, usuallynot having had a clue as to what hit me. 
---
The respawn timer is incredibly aggravating.  Shouldn't be more than 10 or 20 seconds down there given that you gotta run back to the fight every time too.
---
Melee also proved to not be fun in that im just staring at these 2 ugly feet and missing all the action up top. (Well I guess technically their hands)
---
My cryo gun didn't seem to be having a major affect on him. I brought a couple vampire weapons to experiment with but I guess their not the good type. 
---
But hay can make camp walls into doors again so not a complete loss.
---
There was plenty of people in my fight but it felt like I spent half the fight waiting to revive. I understand the need for a respawn timer but why 60 seconds? There was really only like 3 people fighting at a time.
---
Bruh!anybody testing this???I got a full unyielding  3 star as set in my satsh.lol
---
She really is lol, runs in with power armor and whacks everything with her bloodied sledge. It never fails lol.
---
That'll be 69 caps. 🤔
---
Yeah, this one is a pump action. I have a furious combat shotgun, but it shoots peas compared to this new one.
---
I only wear PA for Carrie wait, didn’t wear it in the event and I didn’t run out of the mine. I farmed screws and when the event ended it placed me outside of mine...Had to jump in PA real quick
---
It's alright. Thanks for the offer though.
---
Between sentinel's and serendipity, people can regularly just stand still for entire events with 10 hp.  You can be squishy, but you don't have to if you wear good armor.  Especially if you choose to go with something like bolstering and poison resist.  It's all about choices, and I firmly believe based on my experience that low hp is only risky if you choose to make it so.  Because you can literally negate over 90% of incoming damage with the right armor and perks.  And it's going to be even easier to be incredibly tanky when the legendary perks are introduced.
---
Up until the ghoul sprinters come for you
---
Not really. The people that care enough to have this affect them playing game already stopped playing. We’re indoctrinated.
---
Its op for crowd control on 90 pct of the mobs in the game.  For longer fights switch to furious. It's far from useless.
---
The Duplication and overflow of Gifts last Christmas have tanked their value.
---
Usually don't see them for more than 100 caps.
---
Also drops flux! Bye bye Queen lol
---
As soon as I updated, I hopped on a team with some friends of mine and we loaded straight in to nuclear winter. We had over 40 people each time, which is crazy because I figured everyone would be playing the new event. It sucks that I have to update the game when it doesn't apply to game mode that I play. Just like it sucks for those of u that have to play nw for the  challenges. I'm gonna wait to play the colossal bug event to see if anyone has their weapons stole by an npc or something. I'm sure some game breaking bug got introduced or reintroduced with this update.
---
Yer I'm not bothering with main quests at the moment too low level
---
Are you sure? Vendors' glitch has been patched
---
Ok not gonna argue with you bout fights that last more than 2 shots. You have a point. 
---
Too many people just get to caught up on being “The Best” with the best weapons and builds. Which people think always means one shot an enemy. Not worrying about that makes it a lot more fun. You made me realize how my over competitive friend somewhat took the fun out of it for me. Lol
---
Didn’t say it was useless just that it’s sucks.
---
Bethesda just needs to enable jetpacks on the excavator.
---
don't assume I have the ability to land a headshot
---
I've played 3 colossal problem events on ps4 and the experience was horrendous! So much lag and stutter. Weapon swap lag, instant deaths with good armor. Everyone dying and when reviving people I get one shotted. Not fun at all and the grind for all this decent armor a total waste of time.
---
Way more polite than Paris
---
Happened to me yesterday.
---
But it is cosmetics only, right?
---
Big yike for u but idk how to help
---
Instigating combat shotgun + vats roll of sorts + stealth OHK most enemies.  Really useful for mopping up enemies in radiated zones.  OHK the level 75 Wendigos generally, which is nice.  
---
In general it helps me with the rubber-banding health and other issues that you get with shotguns outside of VATS.  Outclasses my AA/Exp shotgun too surprisingly
---
I'd love a place that sort of acts like a store front for items. We're all too often promoting a single item here or there. But to be part of a large database where you can offer things for selling/trading and allow it to be searched would be great. That way the community could find things faster with what they want and could get a better idea on what the value of items are based on previous trades.
---
Please guys, stop talking about his content he clearly moved on and so should we
---
I believe i just got my Xbox one when this was released, but all my gaming time was spent on RDR2 at that time, then Witcher 3 then Fall Out 4. Then I believe it was early Covid that FO76 was free for the weekend so decided to give it a try, and I enjoyed it but i remember hearing and reading so many negative things about it, it was keeping me from fully enjoying it.
---
Then this absolute beaut became free on Game Pass and decided to give it another go and so glad I did. I decided to get over this stigma of this game being TRASH and allowed myself to like it because I was having a blast w/ it. 
---
Its exactly what one would think an online Fall Out game would be and w/ it being an MMO its going to follow the same guidelines and recipes of other MMOs, which typically is alot of grinding and "fetch" quests. It does have its problems but all of Bethesda games do. I absolutely love it now!
---
I'm currently lvl 30 and been doing solo and really looking forward to alot of the group content so for anyone who's on XB1 and wants to add me (ChefPapa1223), please do!
---
Nope, fully functioning jetpack.
---
Some new event they added. Don't know much about it. No one seems to be talking about it.
---
I'm level 150ish and I have had cunts who are low levels pair up with high levels just so thay the low levels start shit only yo have the high levels back them up so they can all as a group shit on you. Fuck them I hope they get diahrrea and wipe to the point they get a rash and bleed from repetitive wiping.
---
Thank you, That’s sorted my problem
---
Thank you, it’s sorted now
---
To get ammo, screws, fiberglass = caps. So many reasons to run it every single time it pops on my screen.
---
Just wait till the update when you do 50% less damage and he does and takes the same or more. Balanced right? Lol
---
It’s sorted now, it’s because it has some paint on it
---
Same reason i hated the raids. Sound like this is no different
---
If you hated the DMV, Bethesda did a good job.
---
Let earl handle them, agro it and stand next to them. Or just get him off you and tp out. Sometimes the 3 star legendary isn't worth you putting all solo effort. 😒
---
It is just that I feel the whole "Hulking person in large suit with drill arm" just would get some backlash of some kind.
---
On another note.is it the same weapon perhaps duped? Syrange none the less
---
It’s sorted now, turns out it wouldn’t work as I had some paint on it
---
I'd never do that.  I hide in the side cave instead.
---
Uhh...did you think we walked into DMVs and just pointed guns at the clerks all day?
---
*Laughs in instigating magic shotgun
---
Colossal problem for console.
---
🎓🎓 X's 34.5    
---
 🥩   🍺
---
Just keep the green glow with all legendaries when they die.
---
Lolololol
---
10 caps
---
These helped a lot thank you all!!
---
I don’t use power armor. I walk into the nuke zone with my stealth suit. Once inside the mine you have time to change to your regular armor. It is totally possible without power armor.
---
RemindMe! 2 days “check in on this”
---
And that's how you can tell someone has never actually been to this country. There's assholes in the major cities, sure, but Americans as a whole are pretty damn polite. Even in places you wouldn't expect it.
---
"OK Todd I get it please free me from my eternal prison"
---
Ohko isn’t as a big a deal in a game where 2hkos are super easy to do
---
Ah! Adventurer!
---
Wooooow, are you serious?!
---
Exactly this.
---
I really am happy that you found enjoyment there. I don't think working around the system that way would be enjoyable for me though.
---
Just because there are more versatile weapons doesn’t mean instigating sucks. I can have a full health build, not have to have any addictions, and one shot pretty much any enemy in the game with an instigating pipe revolver. Works for me.
---
Only the most serious of curses for the most serious of crimes
---
Is there a daily or something I'm unaware of? I remember doing it the first time but I've never gone back.
---
You don't need PA. You don't even need to leave the mine when it is collapsing. Just stay and loot
---
He was using the machete poison mod most likely, does very miniscule damage but prevents fast travel
---
This post is so cringy.
---
I cut the games suggested price in half and sell mine quite regularly. 1500 caps I think.
---
I tried that but something killed me immediately. Could it have been falling rocks? I died and it brought me outside the mine and I never got a reward.
---
It sometimes happens to me as well. Annoying as all heck, have no idea why. I just let it be for a while, return back after some time and it's back to normal. 🤔
---
Do they ever sell at 1500?
---
Turning off passive and filling them with bullets works too
---
I read/maybe watched a video that mentioned an 8 person cap per instanced event as well...
---
Although I don’t know 100%if that’s true for consoles,that’s how it “was” on the PTS from what I know
---
At the moment you can place the seedy shed and it's door.
---
Edit: unless it was patched today
---
But what if that enemy is at 99 percent. You just doing normal damage
---
nope - I do not want 20lb 1 stars filling my inventory  
---
while this is an issue, that is not the answer to it  
---
We need loot sense, hold I to highlight corpses with loot (maybe have filters, corpses with legenary loot, craft loot etc)  
---
or  
---
Area loot - hold I to bring up the inventory of all nearby corpses...  
---
Highlight unlooted corpses  
---
...  
---
Borderlands set a good precedent with its loot collector, how about getting a collectron that actually collects your loot  
---
Pretty much anything would better than nothing, but I'm sure Bethesda will find some way to implement a solution that makes it worse
---
You are supposed to hate it.  We all hate it.  I remember when the game came out that quest probably had the most threads.  “Fuck this DMV quest!”  Much like the real DMV, you bend over and take it because what else can you do?  At least when it’s over you won’t have to go back for a long time.
---
Aye, have it on my Excavator's suit now. Just hoping they don't yoink it. I'll be pissed at my wasted cobalt flux.
---
You have to actually leave the mine manually. You don't fast travel out.
---
we have it on xbox, I took a picture, but I don't know if it is on PC
---
[https://imgur.com/a/agHJiPP](https://imgur.com/a/agHJiPP)
---
I keep mine at 3/4 or above. I love the rejuvinated perk. 50 life, 70 disease resist, and AP regen ewual to level 2 action boy all for 2 perk points.
---
More of a school activity
---
Logg off 15 minutes before the daily refresh. Don't play NW until you completed everything and you will be safe. I've literally never had them auto-complete until I started staying online for meat week.
---
Also I'd recommend submitting a ticket to Bethesda, but as I've heard, they don't care and won't refund the lost points. Sadly.
---
Gues i wont be selling those for 23 caps a pop anymore
---
Colossal Fail.
---
Could be any number of things. Situational awareness is key in ACP. I play in 3rd person during the event. Watch out for embers floating down from the ceiling, they indicate falling debris. When you're told to leave just stick around to loot the Wendigos and watch out for hazards. On PC the mine collapsing after the Event doesn't kill you, it just TPs you outside after the countdown.
---
It allows you to one shot every enemy in the games (besides SBQ and Earl).
---
Basically, when you go to fight one of those, just simply switch to another weapon.
---
Also, with the nerf incoming. It’s going to be even better.
---
When you make another toon
---
I just want something new to grind for as a rifleman/commando. 
---
As it is all of the good rifles in the game are reused assets from FO4 (Not counting the Fixer as new because it has the same model and mods as the combat rifle)
---
I know I've had to take a serious shit once or twice and used my trusted rubberband with photomode.
---
Oh, you mean like this post, that got zero traction ?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ifsfy0/just_updated_cant_stay_connected_to_servers_on/
---
You have to go through the mine to escape. Fast travel will kick you. Just run to the exit as fast as you can. Even if you don't make it and the mine collapses you will still get the rewards.
---
Not really working around anything...just using what was properly given to me
---
Amen. Joking or not, I play the drums, turn the spit, whatever. Why, because usually there are plenty of damn people killing critters and gathering stuff. I ain't AFK, I'm there bitches, watching y'all running around killing everything that comes in because I'm drumming like a psycho. In past events, pretty sure I noticed that if no one was drumming, there was a lack of critters to kill, so I'm just doing my part. Yesterday, I did a few last ones, had my mic in from a party earlier, so it was ME telling people to drum and turn those spits before the event started. Last event we were halfway between the middle and end point, WHEN THE EVENT STARTED. So, yea, bite me, I'm doing my bit, I don't AFK events, and I don't care if you stare at me either, it doesn't bother me!
---
Also, does ANYONE know where to put Chally's Feed? I looked everywhere, nothing by her water tub. It don't go up her ass, or in her face. WHERE DO I PUT IT!?
---
Guess I am gonna buy that shit then lol. Thanks.
---
So is using "cringe" or "cringy"
---
Sorry but that was my favorite quest in the game so far. Haven’t laughed that hard in a while
---
That ship sailed a long time ago buddy. These sheep support pay to win.
---
How about we lose stealth when we are activating something?
---
Or when a boss comes on?
---
This just reeks of bad/lazy design.
---
Another question; is the steamer trunk still in the mine because I couldn't find it
---
Then when you have a 10k bounty fighting off everyone who would try and claim the bounty makes for even more fun! Speaking of which...
---
Using what?  Bloodied?  I don’t see people two hit killing level 75s in general.  You’re doing sustained damage and they may die in 3 sec, but it isn’t a 2 hit.  
---
Instigating shotgun doesn’t require a build.  And when builds get nerfed it goes back to just damage output.  I don’t use instigating on any other guns so can’t speak to that
---
If you're hiding out in in the spot at the bottom of the shaft that you first jump down into, you're definitely gonna die as soon as he does. My guess is that it seals immediately so that someone who \*is\* trying to escape the mine doesn't waste a lot of time trying to jump back up that way rather than going through the tunnel at the back.
---
What a dumbass :c
---
Bye bye BoS fatigues outfit :(
---
Just farm screws if that happens. I fought him twice, basically solo both times. So far I got some script and a plushie for my effort. I'm out a ton of ammo, stims, chems, bobbles, and repair costs. I like the event, but if you find yourself doing all the heavy lifting while not getting the chance to loot things, it gets old quick.
---
Head to the lighted exit sign, keep going to the loot crate (I've never made it). Otherwise, die, you still get the rewards after you end up outside the mine shaft.
---
What are these 3 OP riffles?  The best aspect of the GB weapons is the crafting + legendary modules.  I've been waiting for a decent CR, Handmade, or anything with a legendary effect worth while.  Best I have is a single star GR, a two shot CR w/ 15% faster reload, and a Anti-Armor Tesla w/ 33% better VATS accuracy (which is 100% broken BTW).  Been playing all this time (lvl 203) and my riffles don't feel OP at all.
---
My current rotation of games as well😂
---
Oh ok. I try not to do that. Although I may make one to try and roll a better handmade rifle. Lemme ask another question and maybe someone can help. From what I understand you can only roll things you have plans for. Is that correct? And if that's correct i could make a character and literally only give him one plan and i should only receive that thing as a drop, yes? Or is there something I'm missing?
---
Edit: Seems like it wouldn't be worth doing.
---
Nothing changed, always been Monogah Mine
---
As permanent as vault raid or queen fights.
---
Indeed. Hence why I said
---
&gt; It's a lazy solution
---
So what's up with people saying that it spawns at assault events? They just on here lying?
---
I joined the event and was literally all alone there. Did I try taking him down? Not today. 🍖
---
Maybe you’re Karen obsessed ?
---
I just want to play the game I bought.
---
This, among many, is the reason why f.o4 remains the superior product.
---
Bethesda do not know how to code for multiplayer online. They’ve shown us time after time with bugs in every patch.
---
Ah, I meant to agree with you. But my bad.
---
Last time I checked the shredder would not grind enemies if the gun was currently firing bullets, it was one or the other.
---
A common strategy was to use the prime receiver for it so that it would always be out of ammo and would be an effective melee weapon.
---
Maybe people are using it as a melee to kill the wendigo spawns?
---
I don't know what an "assault event" is.
---
Such anger
---
So ppl need to not be in a team because it puts you with them
---
Im not entirely sure either gimme a sec and ill link it
---
Why would PA protect you from getting crushed?
---
No you just get a big hole in your roof.
---

---
Picking locks at camps or owned workshops.
---
Are you kidding? That’s the best part of moving a bunch of legendaries. I once moved 1500 pounds worth of scrip legendary items from one mule to the other and picked it all up at once... Thought my TV was about to explode from the sound alone. Lol
---
I was just on private server and we didn’t join teams until we got in mine and we all 8 fought it but first live server I was in team and only 4 of us
---
From what I heard every 50
---
I usually have to relaunch the entire game.
---
Flux as well means I'm never nuking prime again XD
---
The one that was removed?
---
As you type away on reddit
---
There was only one copy of the plasma caster, but there were 4-5 copies of the bloodied gauss minigun and bloodied gauss shotgun.
---
Because console owners kept asking “why aren’t they releasing it to us yet?”
---
Yeah i heard it still happened to some people that logged out, but i definetly think logging out during the reset affects it
---
Im guessing maybe its just another possible spawn area
---
I think the bounty goes of your level doesn't it? May be mixing it up with Caps on kills though.
---
Yeah. That’s cool, until you have a 40 cap bounty and can’t find another camp lmao
---
I’m looking for 2000 cap bounties XD
---
\*innocent and suspiciously nonchalant whistling \*
---
Did that, its been on going for about a week or so now (Ever since they launched that event). thing is, i can interact with people, but i see everyone offline and everyone sees me offline, and tis a bit annoying
---
Leave the mine manually. No fast traveling.
---
Big F.
---
Equip Born Survivor rank 1 and have vampires preferably unarmed melee maxed out agility three in sneak, escape artist, stay crouched but have your HP at about 40% and born survivor proc at 20% running in third person so that you can control where you go when feared
---
😿
---
Yes, that's the Primal Cuts event. The drum at Grahm's Meat Cook is different. 3 drums
---
Ah rip, oh well at least I know how to fight it now.
---
Yeah. That’s caps per kill. A 2k bounty would have people either running left right and center to shoot me in the back or trying to get away because they think I’m a hacker lmao
---
You’re confusing colossal event with just the random world windigo collosas spawns
---
It doesn’t make any sense. 
---
Large scale industrial farms are going. To use larger machines, eg tractors. 
---
Smaller farms and gardens use Mr Farmhand or Mr Handy. 
---
Power armor with a trowel and rake? come on now.
---
I was told changing you icon fixes this.
---
So goto the atom shop and click on another player icon that you own to swap.
---
Goddamnit Eldyrus
---
Deep Pocketed SS mods???
---
Define 'win'. If by receive Event rewards, you need to stick around outside of Monongah Mine until the 'escape the mine' countdown ends
---
Its hard to see. Took me a little bit to find as well. There is a pile of what looks like gray hay near the bathtub.  At work so i can take a screenshot.
---
Oooohhhh, so its a random spawn too but it also has a dedicated location
---
I have done it several times in CSA. (This is with a full group ofc.) Keep distance from Earl and avoid falling debris and the goo on the ground. Also drill etc on the walls are instadeath.
---
If you are on Xbox one ill play with you and help you get some plans if you would like
---
You can buy them from MODUS or have a friend do it, they are transferable. I do this at Max caps and drop them on new players I see building a camp.
---
Check out the YouTube clip I've added to the post... 😑
---
They don't have a clue where to start. 
---
They'll never fix it. Unless it's a half-assed fix that occasionally works six months from now.
---
Such is the Bethesda way.
---
[http://www.23andme.com](http://www.23andme.com) could be helpful for getting a sense of your genetics... although  there is also the possibility you could get connected with a relative if your settings are public. a friend recently discovered he had a sister that his dad didn't know existed. =P
---
Even having this issue using Teslas in Radiation Rumble. Hella lag and unlootable ash piles.
---
I see the problem. This article is about the Wendigo Colossus. That's a random spawn high level enemy. A Colossal Problem is an actual Public Event like A Scorched Earth. It features a boss battle with a specific version of the Wendigo Colossus.
---
Give the charging Tesla shotgun a try.  It uses rifleman perks, but can also use magical shotgun bugs and can be buffed by blocker's armor.  My instigating 33% Tesla shotgun will one shot all mobs near me if I just charge and shoot the ground.
---
As long as you’re white, Americans in rural towns are extremely polite. Anything a shade darker than #FFFFFF and you’re bound to get weird looks or underhanded racism.
---
That’s hot
---
I saw that a few weeks ago. LOL
---
Dont you eventual die of starvation or dehydration?
---
Me (lvl182) and a random level 66 took him down. We stood in one place and shot him in the face until he fell down. Im not sure that screams endgame team event.
---
Yes. I just bought them.
---
I guess on PC it would be a hammer holding down the A or D key maybe never tried to move the camera with anything other than the mouse.
---
Witcher 3 had the same quest basically.
---
the regular version is a random spawn. the boss version has a dedicated location.
---
It gets old but it’s still hilarious and clever imo
---
Yeaaa i was kinda confused on why they looked so different. Thanks for the help man! Is there any significant difference in drops or difficulty?
---
Poison Machete will prevent fast travel whether or not you have initiated combat.
---
The new event is a legit end game boss (instanced). The original collasas had a percentage chance (10% maybe) to spawn at those assault encounter locations during a nuke
---
Edit: random spawns aren’t as tough
---
But do we \*need\* another radiant between lever action and handmade? In terms of gameplay, there is no reason to have yet another tiny variation of the rifle. Hence the recommendation to make it a skin. Everyone who wants it gets another tiny visual variant, and we don't get an even more inflated loot table for little actual in-game value.
---
Was it Halo 2 at the end where you do the warthog escape run? So fun and crazy.
---
It's America. You mean to tell me you don't?
---
To my knowledge that was changed a some time ago to where you won’t actually die from it
---
Since it has been over 24 hours, you can file a missing person report with the police protectrons.
---
Doesn't seem to make a difference!  Jumped on, ran to a Primal Cuts event, and crouched.  Same thing happened as you reported: [DANGER] even before anything was visible or near me.  Sigh.
---
It's a shame escaping gives no benefits compared to staying though. The chest at the exit has no good loot and you miss out on Wendigos.
---
yes.
---
Ok then... going to put that to the test tonight!!!!
---
80 grade handle, OP.
---
I agree, I just did it and I think the whole experience was very well done
---
I joined someone who nuked the mine but once we killed Earle it told to me to escape the mine  and I panicked because I've read that if you die inside you lose your junk and so i decided to fast travel and ruined it myself.
---
Unless you keep deleting characters and replaying from scratch you only have to sit through it once. Hardly worth being this fussy about it
---
Yeah but do you have the knowledge how to operate the printing machines and enough skill make a convincing forgery?
---
yep
---
Just waiting for this guys next post to be “just fished the grind I now got a full unyielding set and a b Gauss minigun” lol
---
Sounds good dude hope we both get hella rewards
---
You put it on the cooking spits near the cooking station wear you donate wood
---
Hell yeah! Thanks!
---
I just need my support build to find a heavy dmg and ALLOW MEEE TO SUPPORT THEM! 😒
---
it is annoying asf especially when you have 3 characters that have all done it like i do. i don’t think it was a bad decision though because it is quite funny.
---
Hey I’ll take a giant wall of flesh that CAN die over an invisible demon b*tch robot that CAN’T die because nobody is smart enough to get on the towers any day. 
---
(Plus Encryptid has a huge cap sink to do it once, that also plays into people doing it or not. Who wants to spend 1800 caps and fail when you can do something as simple as drop a nuke to spawn one of the other two raid bosses where the only requirement to kill it is hit it till it dies?)
---
Ultra light is on the PTS too!
---
Look inside the Tattoo Shop where you meet Biv.  One spawns on a side table next to a tattoo chair and up to five can spawn in the bathroom.
---
I don't support pay to win. It's already an issue that is there. But this is something that's already in game, just a choice to be able to have in our camps would be nice.
---
So prime cuts gives you the prime meat then at the top of the hour grahm hosts a meat cook and there at that event you turn in the meat
---
The performance on my PS4 Pro with a SSD is abysmal... Here's a short clip... Unplayable!
---
https://youtu.be/00gLvEOEet4
---
Wish i had you in my session when I was doing the quest then, I kept running out of black titanium and the enemies got boosted to level 50 even though I’m level 42
---
take it to the Meat Cook. Donate it (increments of 5, up to 15 total can be donated per Meat Cook). Receive meat sweats and scrip. Thank Grahm and Chally.
---
I joined a bunch of teams that I saw on map that seemed to be over, sent them signals. They didn't wanna help my poor soul. 😔
---
I run all gats on my heavy. I just scrapped like 10 and got all the basics. The ring sight sucks, but speedy receiver/long Barrel/comfort grip/bayonetted are my default mods.
---
I'm on console, game plays great.
---
😂
---
I hate blue screening every 25 seconds....
---
This problem is affecting a very small minority, I haven't experienced it, nor literally any big ass bug to feel this frustrated over a game that is giving me the cheapest form of entertainment out there. Is beyond me why do you all act so spoiled and entitled to something so mundane, you could word this shit much more convincing, but no, you have to sound like a Karen demanding an adult diaper because you already shat yours
---
The enclave could always use another member... member...
---
And if it gets spoiled? Most probably it will
---
Run pacifist.
---
This delay is the reason I dropped the game a day after it came out
---
I died right after it ended and it spawned me outside so I couldn't even get the pocket watch we need some leeway there. Did get thepickaxe though
---
I put all jetpacks at 300 caps and they rarely sell. I'm ready to just drop them and let someone else deal with them tbh 😝😂
---
I have the exact same setup.  Mine gets like that sometimes, but it usually just a second or two.  I am currently installing the patch (1.2gb patch and it's been going for 30 minutes now... grr), but I will reply if I see this behavior on it after the patch.
---
Just FYI I would see that 1 or 2 second frame drop during anything, from big battles to just me and a couple scorched duking it out.
---
I would’ve helped you. It can be done solo buts it’s a bitch. The first time I died 4 times but my death timer was almost 60 seconds. This last time with 8 I died once because I jumped straight down and died and no one revived me. Lol you on Xbox? Everyone should get a chance to kill this mother lover
---
Very seldom. I really don't need it for anything but nuke zones. So I haven't built my character up for power armor. It just sucks that in other fallout games , when you put power armor on, your carry weight goes up, but this one is opposite.
---
An AFKer on the Drums is infinitely better than the AFKers who stand around doing nothing at all. I would go so far as to say the people on the Drums are hardly worth considering as AFK.
---
All praise the Holy Mothman.
---
Good tips!!
---
sounds like it, yeah.
---
Totally agree first impression it's ok but he is far to spongy used 3000 2mm and 2000 5mm and died right at end got the event reward but that's it 60 second respawn timer is ridiculous.
---
That's gonna change come the damage nerf
---
Yeah man only have issues when I kill like 50+ enemies without looting them. I feel like it’s gotten better since I played pre-wastelanders.
---
😔😔
---
If your lvl 300+ you 100% trampled over lower lvls and by farming certain things makes it so others cant get that thing like i imagine your a server hopper going from server to server taking all the good loots
---
Only 8 players per instance.
---
That lag, causing missed shots, stagger lock, etc.  I want the fight to be challenging, I just wish the server was more stable.  It was basically unplayable on XBox for my first three attempts.  I launched one nuke and joined in on two others.  I’d love to play the event, it just needs stability!
---
Weird can't join and help?
---
Genuine question, how did you come across this post ? Are you just lurking random subreddits ?
---
So you just lurk on the sub to bash the game that you played for barely one day? Cool story.
---
The meat lasts for a little over a hour I believe
---
Well there are new fatigues that the NPC at Atlas Observatory wears, that we'll get as a reward during the second round of the fortify atlas event.
---
I personally like having the fatigues as underarmor, and was a little ticked when they made it an outfit cause I wasn't getting the shielded bonus from them.
---
Then you switch to a different weapon? It doesn’t mean the prefix sucks.
---
It's a bug, had one do that to me in a normal Watago setting. It had broken legs and crawled along the ground. But if I didnt have something between me and it, I got lazerfaced. Even if I was behind it.
---
If you team member is with 7 other players, no
---
Don’t shadowed mods not even work on anything but wood armor anyways? Or did they fix that?
---
What are they breaking this time?
---
I had it before too, for a second or two every now and then. After the patch it's happening constantly. And when it runs a bit smoother, the hits don't register, explosions don't show up... Mobs don't get hit and then suddenly they do and die... It's a giant mess 😕
---
This is definitely happening.
---
They all work now.
---
You're the one crying! 😂😂😂😂 only reason I have tears is from laughter! That's at your responses! Roflmao. Sorry I don't get angry or emotional over a game or some reddit troll underlining his inability to be a decent person. But whatever. That's not my issue. Bugger off ya lil twit!
---
I didn't even got to experience that. I tried to join an event in progress but didn't let me get inside so after some trying the event ended, i saw some "👎🏻" lol. I don't feel like launching a nuke anytime soon so I will see if it let me get it next time someone else do it. Not to crazy about this event tho
---
Imagine needing to do that with any other prefix.
---
Ran into a little issue with Earle mutating and developing Kitty Pryde powers on my second attempt. Made it a little more challenging, haha —   https://imgur.com/t/bug/mXMzNns
---
Literally was just thinking the same thing ... it’s so dumb it’s like impossible to join I feel like
---
Good with salt perk. Use it. Love it.
---
I did try and come back into it at one point so I joined the sub, but the delay made me leave again. I genuinely have high Hope's for the game, and like looking at some of the stuff people post, so I just generally lurk on here
---
Then you can drop it or hang on to it. Your call.
---
Won’t be an issue after one wastelander update. If you running this with pug then expect low lvls. If you care so much about not having them around then run with a crew bro
---
Sorry is the answer yes?  not PTS, but PS4?  It didn’t make last Tuesday’s update but they snuck them in?
---
Dude I had about 4 sub level 50 players on my team there yesterday.  They were like mad men squaring off with all the wendigo spawns with bats and sledgehammers.  At least they weren't hiding somewhere.  Git er Done.
---
Honestly besides Polly, Grahm is probably my fav NPC. I’ve always loved the non-hostile super mutants, so much character in them :’)
---
I wouldn’t join team until in the mine. First time I was in live server was in team it was just use four against him killed him still. But then I did one on a private server and we didn’t join teams until the mine and had all 8 of us fighting him. Still I died each time and didn’t get to loot the box at end. First time I couldn’t find exit and then Xbox glitches and I died to a wendigo spawn. Second time I loot earl and somehow the spawn jumps and one shots me. I got rewards but still could’ve had an extra shot at cursed weapon. Loot sucked on both of them really. First time I get 1 star suppressor sledge from earl and 3 star bolstering scout armor piece from event plus colossus rug second time I get 2 star assassins combat from him and 3 star hunters double barrel from event and meat pile. But I love the event
---
It's a side quest and its not really difficult.  I did 90% of the quest at level 15 before discovering I couldn't craft the excavator armor until I was level 25.  The same quest will give you the power armor station plans.
---
Bring your own power armor frame I didn't have one spawn in the building.
---
https://twinfinite.net/2018/11/fallout-76-excavator-power-armor-how-get/
---
Personally I'd keep all my stuff, I've made that mistake with other games that get good eventually. Though I admit I don't have much hope for 76, My tolerance is getting real low as well
---
Yep! https://imgur.com/t/bug/mXMzNns
---
Wait what, did someone dump it there or is the raider bot just randomly grabbing godlike loot now
---
That made me chuckle.
---
I personally haven't done all possible forms, as that's just incredibly excessive, but others have and it has no effect.
---
Dude he was in ceiling the first time I fought him and I thought he was going to disappear like I saw ppl say on pc. But we got his last health down and got to loot him
---
It's been around since launch.
---
At this point they can't completely fix it especially considering they tried to fix it once already.
---
25 minutes?   The dude has a Problem.
---
It completely defeats the purpose of making LFGs...Like better be there within 5 minutes or you're fucked.
---
What box?
---
Honestly, me personally I have never wanted a co-op Fallout much less multi-player. All of my gaming friends over the years have been lost to wives and children so I don't have good friends I want to explore these worlds with.
---
Not to mention I read everything, explore every nook and cranny. I hate feeling like I'm forced to miss content to catch up to my friends or that I'm slowing them down. Also the whole vats concept of slowing or stopping time would be forced to water it down into the version we see today.
---
That all being said I still play 76 and generally enjoy myself but if Bethesda released a remaster of Fallout 3 or better yet New Vegas I couldn't quit 76 fast enough.
---
If they had made 76 an actual mmorpg like WoW then it probably would have been my favorite game of all time. Instead we got the frustratingly buggy and yet fun mess that is Fallout 76.
---
Every prefix has a downside. Junkies you take some drops in special if you aren’t constantly popping chems. Bloodied you can get sneezed at the wrong way and die. 
---
It’s exclusively for a sneak build. Sneak around and pick of enemies 1 by 1.
---
Nobody eats beats dude
---
Wanna show me where I bashed the game? I genuinely want the game to be in a state where I enjoy playing it, but yeah man. Ig you know me better than I do right?
---
I lurk in this sub to bash these players. 
---
"I'm vengeance."
---
Don't know we had an amazing team and he just eat everything we threw at him he's a complete bullet sponge. And they want to nerf our damage what a joke.
---
?
---
The real question is how many of you got the grill?
---
I hope someone answers you cuz ive always had this assumption too and its why I never made another char. Cuz Idk if ill just random legendary drops.
---
At the end when you kill him you have to run to escape the mine if you make it there’s a room with a crate that has extra loot and another chance at a legendary but both times I died before escaping mine. So it puts you out in the nuke zone and second time I had to hurry to get power armor on so I didn’t die and lose loot
---
I don’t experience any issues on Xbox one
---
It’s totally fine. I don’t have near as many issues as people tend to bitch about on my xbox
---
Pickled scorched parts that may decorate your kitchen, it looks like a crunchy emergency food stash for sandwiches. You can find it in Morgantown airport. Also meat piles is a thing! Time to make that gory kitchen a thing. 😏🍖 All hail meat week!
---
Amen!
---
I did it at like level twelve and I got absolutely [Redacted] by ghouls
---
What was the nylon bag and nuka rum thing? I played since beta with a few breaks in between, I don't remember those things.
---
And a sneak build can’t effectively do that without instigating? With instigating it either works or it doesn’t. If you’re near other players also attacking things it’s near useless you get just shot at which point you’re not being a team player
---
I’d guess a suit would cost at least twice that, and do way less work.
---
It might run ok on private servers
---
If it didn't have it's use I wouldn't use it either.
---
Yea, just disabling stealth is too far, caveats to how stealth works now would be good like you said, using an item, shooting, reloading even.
---
Well kinda makes sense the raider bot and others do grab weapons. Maybe you can transfer items to it.not linked to personal stash per say
---
Screw lvl. 40s only 50+... I’d prefer it if you haven’t beaten a Queen then you can’t do this
---
Nice. And is it guna be retroactive for players using exsisting characters? Like say someone is level 500 at the update. Would they have 10 slots unless theres a cap?
---
Probably doing cranberry bog events and selling the power armor plans in your vendor 
---
If your reeaaaally don't want to sell items, probably the best way would he getting the fast travel discount perk and doing every event on the map as they pop up :P
---
I've killed it a bunch of times already, stacked on those.. "20k" cursed shovels. Plus I'm on PC. Thanks for offer tho! Nice people all around. 😊
---
The big one is a colossal problem is now in game. And you can get deep pockets for ss armour
---
You have my word, I will not use a Tesla in the new event.🤞🤞
---
It was to activate colossal problem. If you search the reddit you’ll see the comment
---
Broken.  :P
---
Nice, thx, kinda cool event, the prime beasts are finally something of a small challenge for me, bloodied stealth &gt; enter into danger &gt; let the fun begin
---
Colossal Problem Event was added
---
Ah man I didnt know that I had plenty of time in my pa I gotta look up that box
---
Just a hunch, but it could be the thing that everyone has been talking about all fucking day. Again, that's just a shot in the dark.
---
Don't think there are ten slots, but im 99% sure it will be retroactive
---
Yes he has
---
Agree with you on the respawn timer.  Stop punishing me for dying in an event designed to kill me 50 different ways with a boss that virtually requires a low health build to kill.  60 seconds is bullshit, especially at the end.
---
I believe that only applies to special weapons that you get through quests and also bullion weapons. I could be wrong, though.
---
You have to escape the mine after you kill Earle, there is a countdown timer at the end.
---
Yes i know its really annoying
---
Omfg this game smh
---
None of those perks help bloodied build except for maybe the poison resist one I think.   
---
Also I'd gladly swap to better armor, but grinding SS is hell as is. My problems aren't just this system, it's how it interacts with all the other systems in the game that make swapping builds incredibly annoying
---
Yeah look up angry turtles video or any of the fallout you tubers they show it
---
Mega dope
---
Me too I did that quest for quite a while and then I went to Nuketown got sidetracked logged off the game and I had to restart the entire quest from the beginning....
---
You’re welcome

 &gt; You have to escape the mine after you kill Earle, there is a countdown timer at the end.
---
Hey look I just got up
---
I followed these steps and made it out! Got the reclaimed gas mask too! Good first successful run (:
---
How do you  message a camp owner?
---
Idk what the DMV quest is
---
More damage resistance
---
Yesss... Another dupe method!
---
Yeah it feels like a MMO that has been around for half a decade with new content sort of taped on in a not so cohesive way. So many typesof currency and newer end game content with a real lack of content for anyone that just picked up the game.
---
Agreed.  The incremental increase in respawn time for each death simply needs to be removed.  There is no good reason for it.
---
Dang, I wish you the best with your plan man. XD
---
That's not what the comment was referring to. It was the "paying attention" comment since I haven't really used power armor in game at all....so it's not about paying attention. Which is what my comment was trying to educate the hulk's reply over there 😂😂😂
---
sorting by new and reading posts would have been better than posting.
---
Run around and look for the blinking yellow lights on the ceiling.  There is an exit sign by the lights as well but it could definitely be bigger and more visible.  Someone in another thread pointed out that there is a big ass drill in the wall next to it, can't say I've ever paid attention to that though.
---
Run in where the lights are and keep following the lights toward the exit.  It's a pretty long jog to get back up top.
---
Yikes, I didn't know that was the case. I spent the whole time on my last one hoping more people would show up and take some of the load off.
---
You can do it even better with instigating...
---
Sneak + instigating is over 400% damage without taking into account other perks. 
---
Again, just because another prefix is more versatile, doesn’t mean it sucks. You don’t use it in all situations.
---
I worked in a DMV, it was literally my job
---
I failed the event this morning because only 1 other person took part but here were 3 other people just hanging out off to the side. Sadly that will most likely be my last chance to play this event. 😒
---
You just said your regular armor has more protection 🤦‍♂️
---
Considering it was nazi Germany at the time that designed and produced them. So yeah, nazi guns.
---
What block session will do if the person already in the session with you? O.o
---
and there is a loot crate on the way out.
---
Definitely
---
I just did it on PS4. Went in wearing stealth suit and then swapped back into my Unyeilding once I was inside.
---
Earl is a bit of a sponge, but it's the wendigo spawns and environment damage to watch out for. There's a lot going on so I was a bit overwhelmed that first time - died over and over again.
---
Need to find a good spot to perch out of reach/sight of the spawns and stealth will work perfectly.
---
I'm on PC but thank you =)
---
I know you don’t want to give him what he wants, but if someone does this to you again just initiate PvP, let him kill you and then respawn at 76.  Better to lose some junk than to miss the event.
---
Guess what I don’t use reddit a lot. I get on scroll and get off lol
---
Does anyone know if it's possible to nuke and repeat the event on one server?
---
You have to own the game on [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) launcher to access the PTS.
---
I can help you craft a build. I have a group of friends that play daily
---
They want to they just can't get in cause the devs are fucking brain dead....
---
Great job! Glad to hear had a successful run. I've ran maybe 20 ACP Events and after a few of them you sort of fall in to a routine like with Scorched Earth. Good luck with the remaining rewards. I think the mask has the lowest drop chance overall so it's nice to get the difficult drops out of the way first
---
Shoot at it until it dies!
---
Follow the train tracks.
---
I was thinking about that, I’m a first member and have enough friends who are good enough to do it with, will probably give it a try this weekend when I can coordinate with everyone.
---
Be careful if they ask you to place something in yout camp by joining private team. Some people are placing those ammo factories from blue prints that you cannot remove and it messes up your budget and you need to move entire camp to remove it.
---
Well that fixed it. Big thanks 👍
---
Yes but I didn’t know if just power armor in general gives you more DR relative to the falling rocks considering it has a helmet. Either way, you’re not being helpful so please don’t comment on my posts thanks

You are welcome if you ever have questions this format is great for it
---
Until he decides to follow because now his plan working
---
Legit no reason at all it just costed me the event cause of it being 60 sec they killed the wendio and I got jack shit after wasting 300 fucking fusion cells
---
Maybe you should try dying less. 
---
Wait a minute...
---
How many addictions do you have?
---
They cannonically only got them after the Player character stole the plans in Fallout 2. Though I could see them obtaining a few vertibots once they get to Appalachia but just unable to actually make them themselves.
---
Thats the point...
---
...the Tesla Shotgun uses **rifleman** perks? I have an I3315r Tesla Rifle I keep around for low level events and some variants of Free Range. Holy shit, TIL. Totally trying this out.
---
Yeah all fun and games when you think there is a window between you and the assaultron but it turns out it’s a hole and it 180’s and HMMMMMMMMMMs you to death
---
I went in a stealth suit the first time without the quest acctive and I was stuck their for hours trying to figure it out lol
---
Thank you! Have you gotten any good drops so far? 20 runs already, jeez, you must be farming the hell out of it lol. I’m on Xbox so it literally just came out today.
---
May he guide us both brother!
---
You can have multiples so that you can switch from one level to another.  You can't equip more than one of any particular card.  I/E you can have one shotgunner, one master shotgunner and one expert shotgunner ranked at whatever level you have room for in Strength.
---
i think i'll wait a bit before trying this new event....
---
I think this is the reason for the challanges actually there is not enough players so they are trying to force more people to play if they want the score bonus
---
They want to nerf the damage to are they insane I had a really decent team and he just laughed everything off.
---
This event fucking sucks. Just failed with 10 or so guys putting everything at it and couldn’t kill it. And yeah, I died 20 times or so and that respawn timed is ridiculous.
---
same. as a melee build i have HAVE to get up close. this new pissed me off so bad because i had to wait for one minute but they killed earlie before i got to respawn.
---
1/20 chance to get from a colossal problem
---
It's the rarest item to get from the event.
---
No wonder you miss information.
---
have you checked the missle silo holotape to see if they are rebuildin a new nuke?
---
Damn, it looks like that Raider Collectron has gone back to his old ways of stealing and plundering. He went off and stole a bunch of gear from another vault dweller...
---
It was only a matter of time, in my opinion.
---
Those level 76 yao guai
---
😩 😭
---
Magic weapons ?
---
I got all of the rewards except the mask in the first couple of days on PC. The mask dropped for me yesterday. Not farming it too hard, just aiming to hit 2-3 runs per day. The XP and mats from the Wendigo Spawns make it worth the Ammo cost.
---
Exactly so don’t be so toxic huh? Not everyone uses social media constantly.
---
They’re not free. They are just on the last section in the shop. The outfit bundle is a 1st discount.
---
One wasteland isn’t gonna make the boss any easier. It’s endgame content, they aren’t gonna make it so level 20s are able to do it
---
Yeah earle just dissapeared with less than 10% health. What a joke
---
Easy to say when you're not getting cornered by a bunch of Wendigo Spawns and Earl at the same time
---
Wait are you sure the boss is not Todd already since people keep saying it's already bugged as hell? 🤔 New conspiracy theory arises?
---
I use the social tab...
---
Haven't launched in 6 months,so forgot process. Am in abandoned bunker sewing about enclave but will check holotape
---
not really toxic to call you out for missing something that there are probably 100 posts about.
---
I see a lot of people crying. Adjust the build and playstyle as the event won't adjust for you. Play more careful and also melee on this event is trash.
---
Same setup as you, but have seen noticeable lag since the patch last week.  Hasn't been as bad as your video, but definitely have performance issues.
---
If you're worried about what you look like, you're using it wrong. 😁
---
Kinda funny but at the same time, I got so annoyed the ghouls come out every time when you wait. Lol.
---
You should Especially if you're bloodied all it is is getting ganged up by wendigos then having to wait a whole minute just to die again
---
Gold Bullion weapons and armors, The Fixer, Bear arms, and maybe (can someone confirm this?) The Tenderizer plans need to be learned before it is added to legendary pool. 
---
Cap purchasable plans don't need to be learned before it drops as legendary.
---
I didn't know you could do that. Are you on PC?
---
I'm not sure what you mean by special. But I started learning plans for stuff immediately. I don't actually have another character so I can't directly compare. I might just say fuck it and try it out honestly. I'm curious now.
---
The screen was lagging so bad for my whole team we couldn't even play pixels everywhere
---
Same boat, I stopped playing around December of release year. It was fine when the game first came out and everyone was basically closer level wise, started a fresh toon and playing as a new player now is hell.
---
No but the way you used your words. Words play a key part in how a person reads a sentence. I don’t know what tone you ment to say it in. Hell all I could know is that you were doing a squeaker voice.
---
Yea it will , the player will sync to the boss lvl
---
If they ain’t want lvl20 doing this event then they should have made it a daily op?
---
my main is bloodied, yes... thanks for the advice
---
I’m just here to compliment the Mulan reference. Sorry about the griefer.
---
Yeah it's probably fun but my event was so laggy I could barely move
---
I does this event for a week on pc, just move a lot and don't just focus the boss, you need to kill the adds, use a tesla gun and boom no mob and plenty of xp
---
it's hard for bloodied (I'm a shoty bloodied) i changed into PA with heavy guns for the event to help. To my surprise a good gat plasma is doing 30-40 damages pretty good
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I did I started it with my bloodied realized it sucks in this event and switched to my junkie and it still was a pin in the ass mainly because of the glitch and the 60 sec wait time other than that the events great
---
And you didn’t call out anything I legit clicked the tab scrolled and didn’t see anything so I was just like wtf? All i saw was the same un updated stuff I saw yesterday
---
Oh, no, I'm on console. Sorry for the confusion. I assumed PC would have the same option though? How do you join teams and stuff? You don't have a list of recent players on the social menu?
---
TY! i saw your comment as we ended
---
White springs has the plan for sale not sure which vendor inside but it will cost like 5k to 8k caps for it I believe but not sure other than the plan is inside
---
Got to wonder why consoles had to wait 6 days to get the same broken patch as PC version, clearly nothing got fixed in-between
---
It’s a colossal waste of time. Rewards aren’t worth the loss of ammo.
---
Have you seen that sweet fish helmet tho?
---
My question is, HOW DO YOU AFK THESE EVENTS? I tried the ol' rubberband on the right joystick trick. I don't get credit for the event completion.
---
One of my friends got the new helmet out of the chest 
---
That's pretty good imo, it's like the only thing I rly want
---
I’m not bloodied or junkie so I don’t get hit by the nerf quite as bad, but I can see people just sticking with sbq based on rewards, I can see another issue where too many instances of people under level 70 joining where they just aren’t going to be able to do at least 1/8th or the damage needed.
---
I honestly think they should have made it 100+
---
This is what I love about this game. During silo runs and encryptid, troublehsooters are the best. During Early Boii's showtime, fluent gameplay between tanks and dps and medics is needed. The SBQ,,, gets rekt anyway.
---
Nobody's spiteful like Mushu
---
As someone who was too low to attempt that quest when I went, but managed anyway, it was hilarious and thrilling. I had like one HP and nothing but a mostly broken baseball bat when it was over.
---
Don’t want to ever do it again, though.
---
Skip!
---
Think he's far to spongy as a boss yeah the different effect and attacks he has are great, but if I've used well over 3k 2mm and 3k 5mm that's a lot for a boss in my eyes. Had decent team and some times he took loads of damage and other times he just laughed at us.
---
The chest doesn't have much in it. Just some caps, some ores and other junk. The wendigo spawns have lots of screws and the ammo you used to kill them, so they are worth looting. The good rewards are given on event completion. I didn't loot the chest and still got a cursed weapon on my first run through.
---
that has to be the dumbest thing I've ever heard
---
Wastelanders update was a big improvement, but there is still way too much lag at all the wrong moments.
---
Yes it's insane your fighting a lagging screen with pixels so bad you can't see .my whole team is irate over it then you die and can't respawn
---
We do but there’s no chat function whatsoever
---
That makes zero sense. The event has nothing to do with daily ops, and daily ops have nothing to do with the event.
---
If you’re in a team the event only includes your team. Need to do the event not in a public team or private team
---
Environmental hazards are easy enough to avoid. Earl hits like a truck. That and the trash can get out of control.
---
This explains so much
---
No, there's players, I just can't send messages, again as far as I know, it would be nice if they added that feature but you didn't used to be able to.
---
Might be coming with Daily Ops. Datamine shows a Symptomatic camo item.
---
Wait bullion weapons can drop? I thought they were craft only.
---
sowwy i wuwined yow twowing :'(
---
It’s taking forever. I hope it’s worth it.
---
We were on a public team but different instances
---
Naw, junkies gunner power armor jock. Took forever and a lot of my consumables, but we where able to take it down. From the sounds of it the other guy was using a bolt action.
---
Yea the event its self is good it's mainly the respawn wait time and the glitch if you die. It's amazing for screw farming got a sweet 50
---
Im close to a platinum trophy i have 89%
---
Bro u good?
---
Yes, the penalty for death should be something else. Losing some aid, all junk and some ammo would be nice
---
I'd like to know too, I'm tired of hearing her personal problems. I just wanna hear 16 tons on repeat. I need to have a quick talk with her. 😏
---
Must’ve got in at different times then I did it on a private server &amp; none of us were on teams &amp; we all were in the same instance
---
One wastelander is lvling sync all content .. including this event 
---
If Bethesda wanted this event to be endgame content it would have been a daily op 
---
Good day sir
---
Yea it's one of the most underappreciated part of this game
---
Oh wow, that stinks 😕 I would hate to not be able to message people
---
I put them at 15 and they still don’t sell. Typically drop them
---
I’m on the old school xbox and haven’t had any problems yet. Been on since the update went live and have done multiple Colossuses
---
no :(
---
Things like the fixer or the tenderizer.
---
Stop... Screwing around 😏
---
Incoming big brain strat 
---
What if you took over a workshop and built like a shitload of containers that you then locked 
---
And then got someone else to take over the camp 
---
And then lockpicked every single one lol
---
Players can't stop u from fast traveling, Bethesda fixed that a long time ago.
---
OMG YES! THANK YOU!
---
I got ganked by a group of people all with 200+ levels because I didn’t know that workshops were only for pvp and not resources... I was level ten and just started the day before... I do have a habit of not reading notifications but like why gang up on a level ten when you clearly have a plethora of resources... like cool you took my shit and threatened to nuke me... very cool Kanye
---
By the FPS drops forcing the game to not recognize your stimpak inputs.
---
Took 3 minutes to update on xbox
---
To be fair other than ESO this is the first real online adaption of their RPG games, it’s just an off shoot that they plan on updating / fixing even after the next ESO/fallout comes out
---
I’m down to do it if you find some other willing participants
---
What games allow you to teleport out of events? Dont you usually have to get to the exit and leave that way?
---
Not sure but it doesnt drop your loot when killed inside.
---
\*Laughs in Emergency Protocols\*
---
Beets are the worst.  (check your title for a typo).
---
I don’t know. Do you think we can do that at some point? I can give you springs and steel to lock them up again or something.
---
Was anyone running with a Tesla rifle?  We failed cause we got lagged so hard by the friggin auto Tesla rifle
---
Lol, it says escape from the mine not fast travel...
---
Hey I can maybe kind of answer this! I had the same idea in terms of only teaching a new guy the fixer plan and just rolling a ton of them after I get him to 50. According to another user (I’ll try to find his post and or source and edit it into this) the fixer is an anomaly and you actually can roll just about every other weapon even if you haven’t learned them. So on a character that doesn’t know any plans you would have 40 weapons that could roll but if you knew the fixer plans you would have 41 types you could roll, so not worth it IMO.
---
I don't know, some dj out there would love to feed you some beats.
---
Try not dying? 
---
Yes I got locked out a few times but didn't bitch and whine about my personal failings and adjusted my strategy accordingly the next few times.
---
Are you really that mad about losing the opportunity to loot a three star nocturnal rolling pin, lmao
---
Totally agree far to spongy he laughed at 8 of us all with good gear seemed like he became invincible at different points too.
---
they're not fixing "magic" ie bugged heavy weapons so only non-200 Fire rate players will suffer
---
Oh I see I misspelled best
---
Sorry bud ☹️ you can have mine if you want. I think I'm getting out of the jetpack business haha
---
I'm glad you enjoy power armor, but I enjoy having more than 20 pounds extra carry sometimes
---
 No there were some explosive weapons though. And I was spamming a lot of Grenades
---
This other guy was saying something about that too. I guess handmade also counts because I never got one to drop before I learned the plan. I can't say for sure with anything else though.
---
Same here level 382. Hopefully 1 more will respond
---
Yea but there's no excuse for any of this it's literally Bethesda games in general sadly lol. That's the most fd up part of it. ESO Fallout like wtf.
---
We need more difficulty in this game. This event delivers
---
IMO that quest was absolute gold.
---
I remember yelling "ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?" and just laughing at how ridiculous it was.
---
To clarify I understand I'm going to die withy build but with the framerate and the 60 second timer I can't even raid the boss if we win
---
I don't really know what you're saying but i think the mount plans come from the event itself which you don't need to be inside to get
---
I know when I put one at a workshop I can't change it but I haven't tried changing at my camp in a while. Hmm
---
Earn it by killing people that don’t fight back. 
---
You want a big bounty but don’t have big enough balls to earn it? Too bad.
---
For every card with multiple ranks, you can own as many of that card as you'd need to have one ready at each rank.  For instance, if it's a card with three stars, you can have six of that card so that you can simultaneously have a level 3, a level 2, and a level 1.  You won't get any more after that.
---
Shotgunner is a good example, you can have Shotgunner level 3, Master Shotgunner Level 3, and Expert Shotfunner level 3 at the same time for three extra separate sets of 30% damage boosts.  Having the same perks at each of the levels is more end-game so you can swap whatever you want and use the one that fits.
---
There are 3 ones in Silo Charlie on my server jump now,  so I wait. If your want to join my psn-id is Kadem-Ho
---
100 pounds but ok
---
just imagine how broken it must of been if bethesda thought it was bad and had to wait to release this broken pile of doo doo...  
---
it's really great how my dps build has no radiation resistance so once I exit, I die to radiation  
---
its not a matter of gear swapping, I have to adjust my perks and put my weight reducers back in...   
---
They lost all 3 of my fo1st subs, hopefully the community can speak with their wallets and make them wake up and stop putting out dumpster after dumpster already full of fire...
---
That seems to be the general consensus. Guess I'll just keep leveling the 1 character lol.
---
Done it twice with a bunch of randos. Both successful.
---
There's a huge chance that the guy in OP story had no idea what would happen and that this was an experiment.
---
There's no denying it looks neat.
---
But there's always some new hot cosmetic that replaces the old stuff, so it's underwhelming to me.
---
I pick an aesthetic theme and stick to it, so cosmetics have never really been a concern for me.
---
TrY nOt dYinG yea no shit I'm calling out that it's stupid that the respawn can go up to a minute and the fact it has this glitch even tho it's been in development and delayed for months. And when I only have 300 fusion cells and I wasted them on nothing basically of course I'm gonna be annoyed I didn't get a reward
---
Alright then. I’ll earn it by killing you a dozen times. Besides, last time I had a proper fight (pre wipe) I never got a bounty. How many times do I have to repeatedly kill the same person before I get that bounty? And this ain’t GTA, where you can cap someone without them shooting back.
---
Still taking it to heart huh, did my joke hurt your feelings?  Sorry you have no sense of humor.  Not to worry, you’ll grow up and hopefully acquire one someday kiddo.
---
and I still get 130 extra, my point is it's a lot more tedious to set up power armor, and I've already put a lot of effort into the SS armor so I can get the extra Agi for sneak.
---
If I decide to respec into PA now, ie be screwed over for the legendary cards. so many things are working against me if I didn't know any better I'd say I'm being personally attacked
---
Nuke launched in my server
---
It doesn't kill you - it just boots you back to where Monongah Mine is in the overworld.  You won't lose any junk either.  However, since the exterior will be in the middle of a Nuke Zone, you'll want to equip HazMat/Chinese Stealth Suit/PA before you get kicked out, because you *can* die from that and lose your stuff.
---
Ironically, getting killed by a Wendigo Spawn or that infernal ceiling during that time *does* count as a death, and while it's supposed to do the same thing, I've had it respawn me in the middle of the Forest before (and boot me from the event so I got no rewards, which was lovely).  So be wary of that as you go around looting the corpses.  If you want to avoid danger, stay on that center platform, because the ceiling never collapses there.
---
I tried at my camp, no luck.
---
Thank you for this 😎👍🏽
---
What the fuck is this event? i failed it in 2' :))
---
Thank God. This will get my base carry weight to 395, well over 400 with food, chems, and alcohol
---
Nuke launched on my server, PSN Kadem-Ho
---
Wicked! I'll be on today, ill add you. Ign nativelocal
---
I dont think bethesda is making excuses. 
---
They really don't care
---
9 am PST for both.
---
Vendor money resets like 20 hours after sale.
---
I got slaughtered. Level 129. Ouch on me. Damn
---
score: 12pm est
---
vendor: 20 hours past your first sale of the previous day
---
Seems like there is a table of 40 items that can drop without the plan. So probably not worth doing. Was a nice thought though. Super tired of legendary pipe guns my guy.
---
So it worked better for you after the first time? I tried it once and it was the most horrific lag I have ever experienced. It was unplayable. I was skeptical it could get better...
---
Dang, that sucks. I wish I could help but sounds like you've already done the usual (scrap/rebuild, reload the game).
---
The Prime Cuts stuff is a non-Event for me.  I just show up for the Meat-Cook because it completes so trivially that there's no reason not to.  Prime Cuts, on the other hand, is bugged to hell.
---
I appreciate it, hopefully I make it on time
---
Don't you wish that evil on me Ricky Bobby
---
I ran into something similar to this last night. I looked in someone's raider collectron and it was full of weapons and whatnot, which I found odd.
---
Instigating is completely underrated, those of us that know what we are doing have zero issues using it. Maybe try getting good
---
Deathclaw
---
Does PS have a built in LFG search like Xbox? Zero issues finding groups there.
---
I like getting those cosmetics, trying a new look is always what gets me excited! 🐟 Plus that fish helmet tho 👀
---
Score is 12 pm est. Have never figured out vendor reset.
---
30mins in a silo. Brah thats too much time
---
Wait, I reloded my game but not my console. Should I restart my console?
---
Maybe if this game was hard
---
Yes the first time was really bad. But the next two times were very smooth. I was placed with multiple players using Tesla’s the first time, not sure if that had anything to do with it or not. Little to no issues the last two runs.
---
Technically speaking, I believe on just about any weapon, TS in a sense doubles rate of fire. I'm not entirely sure but from what I've been able to test out so far, TS is significantly worse on shotguns as it seems to only add a single pellet. As the mod states though, "shoots an additional projectile", I don't think it'll be changed from shotguns any time soon. I'm not sure how it works with beam splitter though as I rarely use lasers.
---
(comparing to other weapons, MIRV of course works as it's firing a single nuke and splits in mid-air)
---
Something like that would probably be best if you just did a flat platform with whatever you need all set up on the platform. Nothing too big but just large enough to hold whatever your putting there. Also if you happen to have fallout first they have a tent you can pop up that can be an extra fast travel point and has a bed and cook station stash box and scrap box there as well. Which may make it a lil simpler for you as well
---
Curious - why didn't you add this to an existing post, rather than start a new one?
---
Topkek, git gud
---
I prefer 3rd person for any running or jumping scenarios. I mostly stay in 3rd person for most everything but definitely 1st person for looting.
---
SCORE: Tells you time left right in the menu above both weekly and daily challenges. It's 12PM EST.
---
Vendors: Every 20 hours from first trade of the day
---
Found this out today when I managed to score 2000 steel from Line in the Sand even though I was there with an underpowered toon
---
The fact  their is no use for the Chinese Stealth Suit and the relevant perks in the Daily OPS's is a shitstorm waiting to happen.  
---
Just wait till it goes live.
---
I am an Xbox player and would love this thing you call....."Help"......I keep doing thee part of the even where you kill the creatures but have no idea what's Actually going on..... Especially on the BBQ part
---
They stated they will still give end game areas a minimum level, so SQB will more than likely stay level 90 for all.
---
Paraphrase there but yeah. If they are giving minimum to SBQ they probably will do so for Earle
---
Vendor reset is 20hr after ur first purchase or sale.
---
Keep a hazmat suit favorited for when it leaves you hanging in the middle of a nuke zone
---
Honestly I don't know that it would help but I guess it wouldn't hurt?
---
I have an extra you can have. Was probably gonna put it in my vendor for 800 caps. I'm desperately seeking the tenderizer plan. I assume it's the rarest.
---
Daily reset was 4 hours ago, wherever you are.  Vendors reset their caps 20 hours from your first purchase from them after last reset. for example if you buy from a vendor with the full 1400 caps at pick a time, 10am local.  The next time it will be 1400 again is 6am the next day.
---
Oh God your one of those people
---
I KNOW RIGHT?!?! IT WAS SO SLOW!
---
There's a chance for cursed weapons and other drops to spawn in the chest.
---
Ah, ty
---
The meat cook event so you have to kill creature and collect critter chunks to deposit into the shopping cart with meat. Turn meat spits or play drums to slow down the loss progression. Deposit prime meats to earn scrip. You can also collect ferns that are green to turn them into the cooler that wants greens. You have to fill up the progress bar in the upper right hand corner and it takes around seven to ten people to complete the event quickly if you only have 6 it can still be done just slower then normal
---
I think it’s the worst quest I’ve ever done
---
Dodgy with action boy/girl to feed it AP in agility, serendipity and ricochet in luck — kept a lot of damage off me.
---
I crashed in there too but it wasn't related to the event itself or to my internet. Just the game being the game I guess
---
If the game froze you can rejoin, worse when you get disconnected and have no friends on the server.
---
Na. U fucked urself on this one.
---
On Bird Person's world......This is considered "a dick move"
---
Yeah I have this problem with my double barrel shotgun like had 614 shots loaded in but I kinda enjoy it but idk what causes it still makes it fun yeah I have reported it
---
I was playing on my pvt server, so solo
---
Oi all my addictions are gone.
---
I haven’t played in awhile but I usually look for guns + ammo and recipes or plans I need
---
Make marine wetsuit helmets and sell to vendor.
---
If you don’t care about camp aesthetic do as much water purifying as you can get away with, that alone can get you to the cap limit pretty quickly.
---
IMO, if there isn't a cap, there really ought to be one well before 60.  30 is plenty long.
---
Yup. Lately, fusion cores, 45s, shotgun shells, camp plans I don’t have, outfits.
---
Yea you can only do the prime meats events by yourself. You can’t complete the meat cook by yourself
---
They can't touch you anymore. It works. Done it bunch of times to trolls.
---
Best addition to get?
---
'Cause I do not know if other people froze like me at the start of the event without being able to rejoin
---
I don’t recall reading that but okay if you say so 
---
Please don’t play on public server and complain if a low lvl join the event..
---
Damn......This guys really passionate about his bbq
---
I e had events go smooth and others had terrible lag.  And by terrible, I mean the image on screen looked more like a checker board of blocks; controls barely responding. I’m on PC.
---
Just wait for Daily Ops... Stealth is useless there, I think Bethesda is trying to make some builds useless with Update 22 and it's a pity.
---
Have done the event twice on Xbox not one issue at all other than dying last second and not being able to get back in the mine.
---
It was fun and a good screw farm but once I get all the plans I am done with it. 
---
We had a level 19 in with us on our second run  that was fun as no " one wasteland" yet.
---
And he messaged me halfway through the fight to tell me we need help ? Yes you being over level 50 would have been great help.
---
Still completed both times.
---
It's been extra auto-completing due to people staying when the dailies are refreshing to do meat week. 
---
Logg off 15 minutes before refresh and there's less chance for them auto-completing. 😊
---
Also I assume you meant not sell items to other players, but vendors were fine.
---
If you don’t want to sell at all, super mutants drop the most caps of any mob, but that’s a slow grind.
---
pretty sure the dev team doesn't control what goes in the Atom Shop.
---
Xbox?
---
Normal as of August 18th with the hotfix  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2uZWTGKr44jRhx8wuCaGU8/fallout-76-hotfix-notes-august-18-2020](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2uZWTGKr44jRhx8wuCaGU8/fallout-76-hotfix-notes-august-18-2020)

---
I froze, had to restart my game, joined back throw one of my friends profile and I wasn't allowed back in the event
---
Try mini nuking bases with like the mirv mod
---
The collectron stations are bugged when you're putting them at a workshop, they're stuck in their default configuration and you can't change it
---
3 cheap ammo to fulfill the “buy 3 items” quest.
---
LOW level legendary weapons, so tired of seeing lots of legendary weapons and armor - all 30 levels above me...
---
Ive tried this before and they text me saying
---
"Bethesda Support Request: Support texts are only accepted in reply to an active ticket created through our support site http://help.elderscrollsonline.com/."
---
I went ahead and started a chat with you on this app
---
Hoping to get some good deals on legendary weapons (either for use or for scrip), ammo, rare outfits. Up until the new events there weren't any plans I didn't know, so now I'll be looking for the new plans.
---
Fusion Cell and .45 ammo. If they're not 1 or 2 caps each then I pass.
---
This happened to us in the very FIRST run on the server. We had gotten him down to about 5% health and I was unloading on him with my VFFR Gat Plas when he just slowly slipped under the floor. We scoured the place but was nowhere to be found.  So we all kept at the wendigos but it was highly annoying we werent going to finish as the clock kept ticking down. Luckily, he popped back out from nowhere around the 4 min mark. We jumped in quick and finished melting him.  Just as we were looting the escape message came on and we took off for the exit.  I knew about the box at the end but couldn’t find it so I missed it. But for being in the first run it was a cool experience and can’t wait to do it again soon! Im in the middle of moving and Earl will just have to wait patiently .
---
If this is a dupe glitch they’ll disable collectrons... then I won’t be able to hear remarks from my raider one...
---
It just works
---
For me entire website crashes the moment I click "submit a ticket" 😂
---
Omg thanks! I was just going to the prime meat events. Had not seen Grahm’s. Did it!
---
I can't change it at my camp either
---
Yes, I had that same type of lag during my first run. The images on the screen began to break apart. It didn’t happen for the whole event but maybe a good 2 minutes of it
---
It was during one of the interviews at Quakecon
---
Not everyone is having the same problems as you I am sorry to say. 
---
Still sucks you went through all that effort for nothing.
---
Lode Bearing
---
junk
---
Yeh we just did it, definitely spongey but now we know what the deal is I don't think he'll be to much trouble if I'm honest.
---
k
---
The lag is caused by ash piles, not the spawn point of the mobs.
---
Good to know. Xbox here too. I’ll try it once more sometime then. Everything felt like it was on a 10 second delay when I tried it. I’m actually stunned my game didn’t crash.
---
What? How do I get this? Sounds so cute!
---
I'm comfortable looking like a walking Nuka-Cola advert. I don't think I've missed a single Nuka-Cola themed thing yet (including that Twitch Prime nonsense) so I've got like 8 different outfits and a ton of headwear I mix and match all the time depending on my mood.
---
Scummy it is, but developers have nothing to do with marketing nor monetization.
---
What do you mean? Did they used to be cheaper?
---
I’ve got one, on my non-melee character. So I need to go that scary drop and retrieve in private servers
---
Rank three of Blocker is serving me well with all those windigos.  It’s not a perk card I normally run, but it’s value is beyond measure in this event.
---
Don't ruin it for us.
---
Yes, it's caused by switching from a weapon with a large magazine
---
&gt;I figured "new event, new glitch
---
fyi.. its an old event with a new glitch
---
Lol. Just because you repeat the same thing over and over doesn’t mean your correct but I guess you can’t win an argument with a fool, can you?
---
Yeah, I thought about that, too. Figured maybe it could be some settler that came across the Excavator plans and has started a conversion and needs help to finish it.
---
Seems like a pretty Fallout-y quest structure.
---
I've been stuck in loading screens 3 times in a row on PS4 just trying to join a world and had to reset the game, it worked the 4th time though.
---
After the hr long update, I loaded in, and joined a prime cuts.  I accessed my inventory and it froze me out.  Then I tried twice to join back up and it bounced me back out both times.  By the third time, I was able to join another world entirely.  That’s been my experience so far...
---
You don’t have to do the drums. My house is near the top of the world one. It will automatically send prime beasts when the countdown is done, whether the drums are played or not.
---
I’m always late on these kinda things, but isn’t that what they(anybody who sells anything) typically do?:
---
Single items sold at a higher price while bundled items although the cost is higher individual are sold cheaper.
---
Weapons and armor
---
Or you're already at max budget
---
Plans mostly, always on the hunt for something I don't have. Weapons and ammo as well, especially when in close to the caps cap.
---
Love the mini.
---
I like the pistol, too, but unless you're using irons... although lately, it's been working in VATS if I don't charge it.
---
Are your friends on pc?
---
Yup sadly the way the gaming industry is moving for the most part rack up micro transactions give the people a half baked POS game loaded with bugs. Make it free at some point to not have to worry about accountability rinse wash repeat.
---
The cursed weapons are in the drop table for event completion, not the chest. You will get one rare item, some random flux, a guaranteed 3-star legendary and 8 treasury notes for completing the event whether you escape or not. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ic325u/colossal\_problem\_event\_rewards\_and\_datamined/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ic325u/colossal_problem_event_rewards_and_datamined/)
---
Yes, but not who you're thinking.
---
I understand meat week is an old event that came back. Last Wednesday it wasn't in the game today it is; therefore new event. Thanks for unnecessarily correcting me though, people really enjoy when you do that.
---
Really that far back? Wish I'd have seen that mentioned somewhere. 
---
Only checked on a whim today with the out of cycle hotfix.
---
I used 6 plasma cores , are people really using that much ammo ?
---
I'm beginning to wonder why people think this is a good idea. I'm pretty sure teleporting from any previous event in this game removes you from the event itself so why would it change on this one?
---
Master bait
---
*cough* your internet probably sucks *cough*
---
Huh
---
F76 is just a side project for pocket money while they put all their effort on other things. It makes you ask if they play their own games, otherwise they would understand our frustrations. 😒
---
Delayed yes. Still can't nuke and get in on it because my silo has been locked for about an hour and multiple server hops.  Access denied yet again.
---
That’s how bundles work...
---
There was something with the cherry wood floors, when they first came out the budget amount was less than intended. It was fixed and then it would make your camp over budget, I got screwed with this.
---
Are you looking to sell it or just asking for reference? I haven't even played the event yet but I don't think my build is set up for success on this one lol I'll probably be buying most of it
---
I lol'd.
---
Someone bought a tractor.
---
I done this event however 10 people started it and 5 left. Long story short 25mins and the enemy had half health but it hadn’t mutated so I failed and wasted so much ammo but I did get 100 screws
---
If by chance you are standing in the initial drop-in area, it collapses (and will kill you) as soon as Earl dies.
---
1 toon is looking for 3* max lvl armor in every slot except torso
---
1 toon is looking for a TShooter Fixer or Handmade and a couple 3* max lvl armor slots
---
the third is after a Furious Lever, an Instigating Hunting Rifle and one 3* max lvl armor
---
Sure, except the problem is the acumulación of the ash piles together, still a result of the spawn point
---
I'd argue setting up a good set of PA is less tedious than legendary armor crafting, all you gotta do is buy the plans and build it, you don't keep rolling armor pieces until you get a good set. 
---
There is no such thing as a perfect, jack of all trades build.  There is always going to be a scenario, be it nuke zone or tanky boss or this new Daily Ops thing, that is going to throw a wrench in your build.  For me it's poison damage, nothing drops me faster than a handful of Stingwings.  Ghouls slapping away, no problem.  Hordes of Laser toting Super Mutants?  Ok, fine.  Face tank the SBQ, \*yawn\*. 
---
A couple of flying bugs oshitrunawaytheyaregainingonmeshitI'mdead.  That poison DOT is a bitch and a half.
---
Bethesda has built a scenario to effectively kneecap a kind of playstyle.  You gotta be able to adapt and move on.  I run bloodied but I always take off my rads and run full health on Encrypted.  I pay close attention to Mirelurk Hunters and Queens, Stingwings and other venomous bugs when I am bloodied and sure as hell will be trying to plug that leak with Funky Duds once Legendary Perks are fully here.  You may run bloody stealth commando for everything else, but given one scenario that doesn't work, you have to be able to respond to it without completely abandoning your build.
---
Yeah, it really sucks and I can't find any justification for it.  Let the players do it once per nuke, sure, but don't have this totally arbitrary 5 minute timer to get there in the first place.  It makes no sense.
---
If you miss your mark, your only choice is to team and fast travel to someone already in there, hoping their instance has the space for you.
---
Yes, up to three times, just like the Queen.
---
Probably was because of the change in value for certain floors. (if you had the atom shop flooring) I think asbestos roofing also had a similar thing happen with it aswell.
---
Why would they leave? What difference does it make if a low level shows up?
---
You are not alone I guess, at least I have the same experience :(
---
wait, so if you just stay it'll teleport you out? I was worried about losing all the junk that the wendigos were dropping
---
Bingo.
---
Finally a post not complaining!
---
You would have to buy another copy and add it into another bethesda account.
---
Just abuse the AI like a normal person. The npc scaling is coming soon, but you probably won't like that much either.
---
I’m happy for your success. Maybe if it hadn’t lagged on us, we would have been fine? That and if everyone hadn’t left...
---
Yep, happened to me too.
---
It is just straight painfull at this point. I love this game but when I freeze during the Queen at least I can rejoin. Now I can't even do that
---
Well, I'm a VATs Commando Junkie.  I use 2-3k on SBQ usually.
---
If ur on a team, u can FT to a teammate that’s inside and u will put inside.   Works on PC anyway.
---
Thats ur problem right there!
---
No variety at all, just hold down the trigger until you either win or lose, there's a big drill that can kill your player instanty but there seems to be no way to lure the Colossus into it, I don't know how they think these boss fights are fun vs enemies that just require you to spam ammo to chip away their ridiculous health before the timer runs out, there needs to be fight stages and different traps and weapons to activate to help kind of like encryptid but better and requiring different kinds of team work to set up
---
It'd be nice if I knew what killed me. Does he explode of something when you defeat him?
---
Can't lie I'm jealous. I bought the nuka-cola jumpsuits to realise there was a bundle. Now I don't want to buy the bundle since I pay for outfits all over again 😂
---
Screw you!  Screw me!  Screw everyone!
---
Worst part is it's the only way my wife and I can play fallout together. Plus were both big fans of building and both have a year of 1st and still buy atoms on top of it. We are absolutely contributing to the problem and will more than likely continue to.
---
No, the piles being on top of each other or spread apart has no difference in performance drops.
---
Eveyone else left. Once the mine opened there was three people left. Me, the 13, and a one other. I am not going to waste my rounds.
---
Whatever
---
I was thinking any one instance of the event should max out at 2 sub-level 50 players.  They aren’t contributing anything anyway.   It’s supposed to be end game content.
---
This must have some loophole.  I’m a level 55.  Yesterday three people &gt;150 including one who was 512 killed me repeatedly.  I never shot back, but the 512 one-shoted me over and over.   Just the zap from a Tesla and then death.
---
Is it still considered a hotfix when it requires a 1gb update?
---
Would be funny if its revealed that shes an ai robot. Like the grafton mayor.
---
Forest camp jumpsuit
---
I had this happen yesterday and it seems like there may be a correlation between melee and Earle clipping through the floor and ceiling.
---
If he gets stuck there, you just have to wait him out.  Don't unleash hell on him when he reappears - let him walk around for a bit.  He may correct himself once he switches to a different action.
---
Earle glitching into ceiling on last ru 1 star weapons also very annoying
---
Since I'm always in the mode of dumping caps, ammo (at 1 cap per), flux, flux crafting materials, sugar bombs, psychotats and the odd plan that I don't have.
---
Well, that sucks, yes. But it's not the low levels fault, it's the ones who left.
---
well, one bug that can occur is that people sometimes show as offline, even though they are online.
---
The fix for this was for the person who shows up as offline to change their player icon, and then they show up as online.
---
Not sure if this is what is occurring here, but worth a try. When both of you are online, either have him join you or you join him. If it shows that they are offline, have them change their icon.
---
They increased the budget cost of foundation blocks a few patches back.
---
You can roll Vanilla weapons. Any weapon that requires plans \*from post-vanilla release\* will only roll if you learn them. So things like the Bear Arm, Fixer, Tenderizer, and so on. Same for gold grind items like the new Gauss items.
---
I love it because it is so fucking on point. Most games would make a slow DMV joke and then blow past it through some sort of excuse because they don't want things to slow down. I love how they instead embraced it, and each time you say "It's gotta be done now, right", and it just... gets... worse.
---
If u have bloody mess he will.   But could be the red circles on floor or Whats falling from ceiling.   Shit takes ur health away fast if ur not paying attention.
---
I swear all the load times are getting worse. Seems as though half of my playing time is load screens.
---
I keep checking my internet speed thinking there's a problem.
---
Year 2069. See ya later bois, gonna watch a few seasons of my favorite show and come back. It should be done loading by then! 😂😭
---
i got 300 seconds of loading time opening up my map :)
---
Seriously, I had to go find those mirelurk spawns , you fuckers get to suffer too!
---
yes, we are both on pc
---
yeah... no, not that.
---
Really why is every other prefab priced lower then that dome? Why if I were to buy a stash a prefab and a defense wall individually I would end up paying 1000? They purposely jacked the prices to make the bundle seem like you’re getting a discount but you’re not.
---
Drop weight.
---
&gt;**Bethesda** why in the world did you release an event that is still broken.
---
I believe you answered your own question.
---
PC live server players are just PTS part 2 at this point.
---
nice pun.
---
Where is the loot crate? At the very end of the exit run?
---
Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica
---
Fighting prejudice with prejudice, are we?
---
"Hurr durr, dum cuntry bumpkins r racist"
---
Ok I was sorta confused since I’m not sure and know much about the Xbox pass thing but you just might have a bug that shows friends offline happens at times
---
Whoops.  I’m level 14.  I took an unused workshop this morning just for the experience.  No one was anywhere near on the map.  Figured it was safe/acceptable to do
---
&gt; There is no way that this event was tested on console with 8 active players by Bethesda Devs
---
I bet they did.. but on a truly private server...
---
It will remain for the indefinite future.
---
Whoa, this is out for consoles now?
---
You don't lose your loot if you die during the Event. I've been running solos on PC and I tried a few different ways but to get through it without burning through huge amounts of resources, sneak works incredibly well! Well done for completing your solo run
---
I doubt it. I played on PS4 too for a year before moving on xbox and had the same problems I have here with the crashes
---
Not even, this has happened with every meat week. They ignore suggestions to alter npc faction data so meat week creatures ignore and are ignored by other spawns.
---
It’s a chain affect if one person leaves because of a low level then others will leave
---
U don’t loose junk dying at end of event.  Event ends when escape the mine timer runs out.  If u die anytime before timer runs out u keep all ur junk.
---
The game is still fun but man sometimes it's hard to enjoy it fully haha.
---
Just out of curiosity, how many times did you die during the event?
---
I've died a couple of times just as, or slightly after the boss died, so missed the body loot, sucks.
---
Yes, if you stay you will just be teleported out at the end of the countdown. It will not penalize you at all. You still get rewards and will not drop items.
---
Don’t change a thing. High risk high reward. Losing out because you died sucks, but a game isn’t a game if you win 100% of the time.
---
completely (p)unintentional
---
Wall to door functionality was also returned,  someone claimed it happened on the 18th but never saw it mentioned anywhere and had only just checked today on a whim and saw it was returned to normal.
---
Thanks man just finished it and got a cursed pickaxe when you guys are finished I'm down to run a nuke silo or do another one
---
There's no way to properly respond to it with my build, I've been working on it for a long ass time, and now if I decide to even respec a few points of special to fit into a more tanky simple bloodied commando, I'll be screwed out of even more legendary card coins. And I dont want to do that especially because I'd only be doing it for a single event, and a large part of the unyielding would be pointless, the bonus AGI.
---
PA is easier to set up, yes, but it's mostly strength points, I cant really swap to it to cover my ass because they wanted to get rid of stealth for a single event. I'm also looking forward to the follow through perk for sneak damage, especially since sneak damage is getting nerfed like everything else.
---
It's stupid that I should be forced to abandon all the work I put into their annoying tedious and boring grinds just because one event is horribly balanced. Especially with how it would screw me over in so many other places.
---
Follow-up PSA: There is literally no reason to escape Monongah Mine.
---
Yeah, it's cool the first time, and you can get some Caps and ore from that red crate at the end.
---
*But* wouldn't you rather stay behind and collect 300 Screws and a bunch of Acid and ammo for your trouble?  You get the same event rewards either way, and dying to the mine collapse doesn't count as a death (although make sure you equip some kind of HazMat/Chinese Stealth Suit/PA before getting whisked away because you will spawn in the middle of a Nuke Zone).
---
Do you wear a Clown Outfit, by any chance?
---
I'm pretty sure like 4-5 times
---
U don\`t have to use any build while firing broken effect weapon with devastating impact and while more ppl doing this, there is no chance for poor critter to survive. But I can imagine it\`s way easier to blame bloodied builds than broken game mechanics. :)
---
Get a SSD
---
Yes it is the low levels fault! They have 0 business being there!
---
I reckon they thought that there was one less bug than than previous events so they released it thinking they did a good job.
---
Never thought I'd say it but I miss having multiple settlements. One camp just isn't enough when you get the itch to build.
---
Weapons that fit my builds
---
I wish it wasnt as it is basically unplayable.
---
Weird, I have played the event other times and it never got this bad, besides, the fact that I couldn’t get close to the center without dropping to like 1 FPS would suggest otherwise, but whatever, keep glitching events and downvoting people calling you out for it if it makes you happy
---
I was able to get on time, unfortunately I was the ninth person to join.
---
And since there are only eight players allowed in one instance I was all alone. Great game design Bethesda.
---
I'm a trucker from rural Michigan, and I remember the first time I was in the northeast, I was like "Why does everyone look away when I go "how's it going?" when I walk past?"
---
Turns out greeting every single person in earshot is a midwestern and southern thing.
---
Whoops?
---
Anmo, scrip and glitched quest objects
---
Have done 3 runs on xbox no problems. Took him down in under 10 minutes. Lag was very minimal
---
dead after earle death, win nothing cause spauwn outside....
---
Thanks for posting this. I’m planning to solo it the second I get out of class too. I’m a Bloodied Heavy loaded with a Big Guns Bobble, Psychotats, 10,000 of each .308, .50, and 2mm EC. I’ve been waiting for this since June.
---
grrr
---
The little things in life.😁
---
Pretty sure you screwed yourself on this one, not Bethesda.
---
Full that. Fck casuals
---
Yes, I have small hands and the official Xbox controller I kinda big, so using the d-pad for a circle scroll is hard, I liked the one in fallout 4 where it was a cross shape better
---
Tell your pals to stop using energy weapons. Those ash and goo piles are what's making it lag.
---
remove all defence and alot of lights, takes up alot
---
No idea what causes it but I sure enjoyed having 400+ rounds in my automatic railway rifle while it lasted.
---
I just checked my stash box, 209 loose screws! :D
---
Yeah I think that covert ops bloodied or junkies builds would have a much much easier time of it than I did!
---
Are you serious? Whatever. Have a nice day, kid.
---
I love me some of those bobbleheads and megazines. Not those 600 caps bobbleheads tho. I ain't supporting that.
---
Amen to that. I love the game but god damn if it isn't painful to play.
---
Can't you still open the chest at the end if you die? Just run back to the entrance before the timer reaches 0.
---
So anyway, I started blasting
---
Try glitching through the silo to save time. You'll want all those unnecessary 20m back one day
---
I’m glad you had no problems.
---
its never been like this for other MEAT Weeks..
---
even when asshats were dropping bases with turrets on the spawns.. 
---
not on any of the PC servers I ever played on.. no way
---
&gt;says that while playing the most watered down mmorpg on the market
---
That no longer works. You can’t damage bases unless you’re in active PvP with the owner.
---
I’ll try and remember to avoid those kinds of weapons then.
---
Non issue
---
If you have a build like that, throw in Mister Sandman Rank 2 also. 3.5x sneak bonus does mega damage on solo runs. Not so great with mixed groups as one player getting aggrod breaks the bonus
---
Thanks, but it was something that happened today. Everything was fine yesterday. 😔
---
Hmm you are an exploiter. Enjoy your ban
---
Yes. I bought 2physical copies and it's just a code.
---
Don't worry if your luck is like mine it's a one-star nocturnal lead pipe. I've gotten that twice from him...
---
Yup. And i want it to NOT be watered down. But a casuals lpgoc gotta casual lol
---
Yeah
---
Earle has never once died in one piece when I've done the event. There's literally on way his gibs would make their way up to the mine entrance before it collapsed lol.
---
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind and if it happens again I'll let the others know as well, just gotta hope the have gamechat enabled, fingers crossed
---
 Honestly make sure you have a vampires as backup and either a medic pump or some ranks in born survivor. Then again you probably outdps me 4 times over and might not get so far as needing that much healing :) best of luck to you, let me know how it goes!
---
Go play rust then lol
---
The Wendigo Colossus Rug from A Colossal Problem.
---
I’m pumped about these screws , had like 8000 this morning now I have 9000. 
---
Why are we excited about screws ?
---
Instead of fussing with your gear, you should fast travel away during the 0 rads grace period.
---
Also, ironic.
---
I don’t have to server hop. My daily farming route takes me through a lot of areas that already have the things they tell us to look for. 
---
I don’t have to skip event objectives either. Hell, one of the challenges is to ***complete*** events.  
---
Why would I destroy something I just created?  I go to a workshop and claim it, then drop my blueprint in about ten seconds. Challenge done.  Move on to the next thing I want to do. Doesn’t even use up any of my own resources. 
---
Tell me, do you pick up Bobbleheads when you see them?  Do you kill Super Mutants when you encounter them?  Do you buy things from other players’ vending machines, or sell things in your vending machines?
---
And who cares whether it’s called a ‘challenge’ or a ‘task’ or ‘action item’?  Sure, maybe ‘task list’ might sound better. But same goes for Legendary gear. A better term would be ‘Enhanced’ gear. But that’s simply semantics. Is that the crux of your argument?  Semantics?
---
Bugged quest items that have lost their quest item flag. Sadly I almost never find any.
---
I dont dislike it but really could care less , my camp has no walls at all
---
I like that this event makes you think about how to set up your gear, build, and tactics to do better since it's not just a copy of the queen fight. I was dissatisfied with my first go but next two tries improved.
---
Wow thats a lot of randoms. alright. Thanks my guy
---
Should be. Cannot confirm
---
/s?
---
Or does double sided walls refer to something I’m not aware of? Because double sided walls to me is the bug where you could put 2 walls on the same side of foundation and give both sides wallpaper.
---
Honestly, as far as I can tell it's just a glitch when swapping weapons. It doesn't seem like something a frequent bug but hey, I'm not going to complain if my double barrel, harpoon gun, or such as 100+ rounds loaded.
---
People solo it.
---
I've done it easily with 3.
---
I don't think you will realistically ever have 6+ low levels coming to leech your event.
---
What he did was not very Meat Week, this is a time of togetherness and meat sweats god damnit
---
I do not know for certain, but I think he is not affected by the explosion from explosive legendary effects.
---
Are you saying I cannot fast travel out after killing Earl?
---
Yes that's what it is. The finally fixed it so we can do it again. Patch 21 got rid of it but it's back now!
---
Its caused by emptying (shooting all your ammo) your weapon, fast switching to a heavy with a full mag, and switching back before the original weapon could reload.
---
what's wrong with your arm?
---
 That didn't work unfortunately. Both of us changed our icons several times and we still see each other as offline. Thanks though
---
It acts like s blender, i had a bloodied with bash damage and it fucking RIPPED the only issue is it burns through the durability like mad and you gotta use it in PA otherwise it drains AP and you get smacked around and staggered a lot... more that is cause apperantly a rotten corpse smacking a fucking robot suit is enough to stagger it.
---
OPs post happened to me I tried running back to the entrance but it seems like it was immediately resealed as soon as you kill earl
---
That's not part of the game anymore you can't do any damage :(
---
Yes that’s true but not in this case. Every item in that bundle is not giving you a discount though. Compare them to the blood eagle and red rocket items if you bought the same items but from a different set individually, you’d pay 1000 atoms. So the bundle isn’t a bundle because you’re paying for each at regular price in the bundle compared to all the other similar items. They raised the price on the items from that bundle to give the illusion that you are getting them cheaper when in fact you’re paying the normal price for them in the bundle. So even if you decide to just get the dome you’re paying 200 more atom than you would if you got the Eagles nest or red rocket garage in comparison. I hope this makes sense. I’m just trying to point how they are trying to do us dirty
---
Oh good. My camp is completely built out of this lol, I was worried you were mocking Bethesda for removing this function.
---
Granted, I guess they did technically. Lol
---
OK, that is probably it.  I fast travelled out to Foundation to give Earl's daughter his Holo which the screen said I needed to do.
---
I understand what you are saying but a lvl 14 isn’t gonna do anything during the event so you will have to use more resources for a lvl 14 who you probably don’t even know and the lvl 14 shouldn’t even be there in the first place.
---
Yes it’s not nice to just up and leave but you also run the risk of not completing that event because of that one lvl 14.
---
If you can solo wendi by yourself then by all means go with the lvl 14 but if you can’t then you weigh up your pros and cons
---
Kid? What the F' ever man! You know dang well I am right. You just want to be an A'.
---
Idk what meat week you're talking about. These issues have been here since round 1.
---
The only new thing is the permanent [DANGER] which allows you to easily lure spawns away from the event and to another players camp.
---
Are you sure? Ive done the event probably two dozen times and seen nothing but a handful of caps, ore and some stims in that chest.
---
I got the mask twice from the end reward after the countdown, are you sure he didn't confuse the chest with the event reward?
---
The  **Bos taurus** named chally
---
I’m attempting go #2
---
The wendigo spawns are based on damage done to earle, not on time. I get the same amount in 5 minutes, you will spawn a huge hoarde of enemies though.
---
Don't worry. I too did this in my haste!
---
I don't know about you but in my 3 times doing the event I have yet to experience any of these stimpacks work fine unless your under the amber which pretty much Insta kills you and no lag besides people using tesla which drops in fps not lag issue and as for the textures yeah those will forever be bad  in this type of engine
---
They need to bring back Survival. Then I won’t need to worry about bounties and all the rest of it for a fight.
---
I think I ran into this bell-end on pc. He came to my camp and started attacking me with a machete with some effect added. I just ignored him and he left.
---
Whoop whoop
---
New from West Tek Commercial, the Automatic Growth Reaping Initiative, or A.G.R.I. Powered Armor! Quadruple your yield with our patented harvesting technology!
---
West Tek is not responsible for injuries, crop failure, soil erosion, or irradiated crops as a result of use. Any similarities to Garrahan Excavator armor are coincidental.
---
Disgrace upon his moo-moo
---
This happened to me currently with the prosnap camera. 180 "rounds" of film locked and loaded lol.
---
I’m level 287 and never completed it.
---
Please stop trying to propose fixed to the game with legendary perks. Those perks should add new, fun and interesting possibilities to our (already limited) builds.
---
If you zoom in on the map, you'll be able to see past the player icons and still fast travel to the event. Works for me everytime.
---
Nahh not very meat week at all fellow travler
---
Darn, so much for that idea then. :\
---
I absolutely hate their atom shop marketing. You can get so confused on what's in the bundle if you don't analize it. Often items that are *NEW* and on *SALE* are just f4 content that were never without a sale to be on sale. Also love buying an item I think is cool to find it's part of a bundle that I don't get price reduction and pay for the thing all over again. Must I do a full term detective work to buy an item I want?
---
Fallout on PS4 is 71.39GB. I have 96.74GB of free space and I can't update the game unless I delete 7.66GB from system storage according to the error I received. Is Sony trolling me or Bethesda?
---
This is the first time those items have been available, how tf can you say it's not a discount?
---
Too many mutations ought to have a couple of side effects. :D
---
Bobblehead display and magazines also take up a bunch of budget.
---
This. I've been a Fallout fan since FO2 (missed 1's initial release), and one thing I noticed through the years is that Fallout, as a fandom, sucks ass. Fallout 3 could never stack up to Fallout 2. New Vegas was just a dull retread of 3. 4 could never stand up to the tour de force of NV. In the rose tinted memories of the fandom, every Fallout release was a bug riddled mess, but where it's an unforgivable sin for every other Fallout, for \*theirs\* it's just a small thing that they fixed eventually.
---
As for 76, my god.  The perk system, the multiplayer, the very idea of PVP, the "completly empty world with no NPC's", and sweet baby Jesus, the atom shop! 76 was a shitstorm well before it ever came even close to beta, and continues to be a shitstorm to this day because, unlike previous titles, this one is still relevant enough to bitch about. There were valid criticisms (mostly bug issues), but they drowned in a sea of bitchy fans who forgot their ~~Formula P~~ Preparation H before it was announced and never really healed.
---
It's a flawed game. So is every fucking Fallout since 2. The question is not, "is it flawed", the question is "are you having fun".
---
You don't have to exit, you don't lose anything for "dying" in the mine.  All you "miss out" on is the loot chest at the end which doesn't have anything good in it anyway.
---
I don’t care that you’ve soloed it or done it with 3 people, that doesn’t change the fact that low levels have no business being there and are making it much harder to do when there’s limited player capacity
---
It's laggy as fuck almost unplayable
---
Fair warning, melee is terrible for this fight. Especially low health build melee.
---
You get feared all the time, smacked in the back by adds, have all kinds of DOT damage applied to you, and hitting Earl's legs with melee is actually surprisingly difficult due to their skinny hitboxes. He can also 1-shot you with one kick.
---
Mods online is... hard to do. Especially considering that folks are constantly upset about lack of PvP balancing, the amount of NSFW stuff folks put into Bethesda games, etcetera... Yeah, no offense, but my prediction is that you shouldn’t hold your breath.
---
Then you can't blame Bethesda for it; they tell us what is coming in the ATOM shop, it's up to us to utilise what they provide.  This is called personal responsibility.
---
So 7 other high level players felt that one low level would bring them down? 
---
I see what you're saying as well but there are low level players who can easily take down enemies. I just think it's pretty ridiculous to not even give it a shot.
---
Well do man! I’ve actually already solo’ed the regular Colossus and it was definitely a challenge. I’m actually running Ultracite with Emergency Protocols on my chest and Jetpack on my Arm
---
You must not be armed, then.
---
If I wanted the event to keep glitching out on you, I would have told you that ash piles have a lesser impact on framedrops.
---
Beth screwed up the optimization on the piles, don't blame players.
---
Yes, in the cage on the right.
---
I want a Babe costume so me and my Ally can be moo friends
---
Ok so I start to understand better why I saw SS Uny AP full sets sold on ebay... And bloodied Gauss Shotguns.... A new glitch seems to go on right now.
---
Not to mention that I saw a level 1 wearing SSA chest....
---
How do you apply it?  Got it a long time ago but it doesn’t seem to have changed...
---
Keep in mind also that although it can be difficult to come by, if you get a few pieces of armor with AP Refresh, you can effectively eliminate the need for Action Boy/Girl.
---
Yes, it does stack, but it's not worth 3 SPECIAL points.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
That can also be the case 😂. Never winning
---
I'm not sure tbh, only just unlocked it
---
I guess youre lucky then. It's just frustrating to echo the same concerns every time an event relases for this game.
---
My quad explosive harpoon gun had 400 rounds a couple of times. That was fun. Hasn't happened inquire a while.
---
The patch notes say something about a C.A.M.P. budget exploit related to small (?) generators, iirc. Look it up: -&gt; bethesda.net
---
Sure, okay. Have a great day.
---
Manually Clicking Respawn has been know to work. Its worked for me everytime i get stuck and cant hit space to respawn.
---
Ah yes, the "play something else". With it, you only try to hide the fact that you have no other arguments left. Gg
---
That’s not ocd, that’s just wanting it tidy
---
I did this quest again for some strange reason on my main. Not sure why but it was available again for me or a a friend a few months back when we were playing. For all I know we never officially completed it or maybe it was bugged. Either wouldn’t surprise me. 
---
But there were like 50 J27 ghouls one after another. They kept spawning and it seemed like we were stuck in some kind of weird time loop. That item or button behind the desk would not trigger for us in the mission so something broke and the ghouls just kept respawning. Never found out why that happened but it was pretty damn funny seeing it loop like that for almost an hour. 
---
We eventually gave up and left though. Neither one of us have the mission anymore but I’m still really confused by what happened that night.
---
Didn’t know this.  I will test this later
---
Yeah, no.  Bloodied is not necessary when you have a magic weapon.
---
Not even a hacked gun.  Just an ordinary, run-of-the-mill weapon with the right prefixes will do it.
---
Oh indeed the enclave is here always has been
---
If you say so... I've never actually seen it because I'm always dead or already outside while it happens.
---
Uhh... chest?
---
Rare outfits, plans, and specific types of ammo (.45 and shotgun shells).
---
Specific legendaries that I never find lol
---
I’m just saying Bloodied Builds only enhance magic weapons. So I guess you do have some imagination.
---
I got there as soon as it started but ran the wrong way back outside :(
---
They need a much smaller map.  Even for over 50 players the starting map is retardedly big.  I've spent 15 minutes looking for someone to fight before.  Now all I do is find a bush and AFK because it's the same result but I also get to do fun stuff for 15 minutes.
---
Kind of sad how some of the only things were happy about in the community were fixes to problems bethesda caused... I don’t think we should be praising them for this, even though it’s a good change. It shouldn’t have happened in the first place
---
Depends on the person tbh you weigh up your pros and cons if you feel like it’s possible and worth the risk then sure if not your choice from there..
---
And like I said all it takes is one person to leave and the rest will follow becsuse with one low lvl some would feel like they are a man down and after one leaves the rest will follow 
---
And
---
like all of the MEAT Weeks and the MEAT Weekend that have run previously is what Im talking about..
---
mobs pathed properly to the barrel unless someone had a base with turrets that was right on/next to the spawn points.. then they would fight the base instead of pathing to the barrel
---
No All other prefabs defense walls and stash boxes are cheaper individually, there’s no reason for these items to be more expensive when they don’t add any extra value. So if you bought three of the same from a different set you’d pay 1000 atoms same as we are for that bundle which I’m saying we aren’t really getting a deal. The way they are marketing this to us is to make fools of us
---
No offense but this seems more like a visual glitch. OR! Do you all remember when you had camp budget glitch or something and people could take your items you had in the stash?
---
If this is dupe, fine, IDC, I just HOPE this is not one of these "feature" moments, where people would be able to steal my stuff from the stash. &gt;:(
---
Can't use them if you're Bloodied heavy. However, from what I've heard, I also shouldn't use my BE weapons. Looks like I'm using my 1* Vamp Plasma Caster.
---
Eating your ass, or eating *your ass*? The details are important for these things.
---
This is reddit, not a video game lol. Using GG just makes you look like a tard
---
If you had control of when you died, I think many would choose to not die.
---
You can't redo those quests.
---
After a nuke is launched from a Silo, there is a 3 hour timer on
---
- that silo on that server
---
- that silo on the launching character on any server
---
These aren’t new. Respawn glitched have been happening before this, so have the far away enemies at heart of the swamp. Don’t shit on bethesda when what you’re hating on them for isn’t even true
---
Thanks, I saw that. I don't have any at my camp, so I don't think that's it. I read the patch notes. 🤔
---
Yeah I get that but I'm always willing to forgive.
---
&gt;folks are constantly upset about lack of PvP balancing, the amount of NSFW stuff folks put into Bethesda games, etcetera
---
If and when they do introduce mods, they're gonna be on private servers anyway so those issues
---
I sold mine for 37k .50 cal. Ive seen some people trading legacies for them
---
It sure does enhance it though, I don’t know where people are getting the notion that I said magic weapons are exclusively bloodied.
---
Wendigo spreading my cheeks and eating a buffet of ass.
---
probably a private server, running public server hardware.
---
I thought it was fantastic!
---
Frustrating yes, but utterly fantastic and one of the most creative quests in the game
---
Are you sure it's not that people died and got the respawn bug? It's a pretty good place for low levels to get xp so I can't blame them.
---
That’s honestly super disappointing even though it seems like a good system, just because it means I can’t play my character in a way that I would understand; I’d have to start over.
---
I appreciate all the info tho.
---
I know that, and yet the last dozen or so updates all hit on the same day for all platforms, so I figured they wanted to iron out some performance hitches for the console versions. Looking at the initial reports about the new event on consoles, though, I don't think they succeeded...
---
I click when the vault boy shows up and tells me to.
---
You must've gotten really lucky and never tripped the adjacent spawn points or random encounters.
---
Ie: if you get too close to Cranberry Glade, you spawn the mirelurks there. The fog crawlers will focus them because they're much closer than the meat week drum.
---
They left in the waiting area before the event started
---
Dude, exact same here.
---
Utter hell. Lol
---
When you first spawn in to the event, it's the door to your left. So running out, itd be on your right just before you exit the cave.
---
Does he also have an unreasonable amount of defense where you need some cheap-ass near exploit build just to do more than single digit damage to him?
---
It’s still putting adult content in a game not rated for it. NSFW mods are likely gonna be banned if they do this.
---
Plus, if it’s a private server, what’s the point? You get to look good with you n your three friends in an empty lobby for like $100 a year? Sorry, I just don’t see a point to it, no offense.
---
If you leave do you even load into another instance? Or are you out of luck?
---
&gt;The reason that fallout 4 and previous fallout games were so great was  because mod creators came in and fixed all the bugs, released unofficial  patches that prevented crashes and other game breaking bugs.
---
Wrong... Those games were just great in general. Fallout 3, New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim all those games I finished at least twice and I never used any mods.
---
You mod lovers always act like modders "saved" those games because they were completely unplayeble or not fun. It's not true at all.
---
So you experience 0 fps drops during the event?
---
Ah yes, the "this isnt" argument.  Only to hide that you are getting desperate lol. Any USEFUL information in all that senseless garbage?
---
To bad I can't do the quest lines
---
I don't even bother listing them anymore.
---
If I have any, I just drop them for &lt;50 people I see in PA.
---
It isn't considered fun or actively affects the player in a positive way. Why would they fix it?
---
If you're on xbox yo hit me up.  I have never consumed a magazine, and all my shit is 10 caps except for a few plans and legendaries.
---
Good to know so I'll avoid it, ty.
---
I think we do man lol and that’s a lot of work to do for a game 
---
All Bethesda has to do is be consistent honest and fair. It’s a triple A game ffs
---
Ha! I say that often in that game.
---
There is no reason why Vertibots should be killable by other players. All player-owned vertibots are friendly to other players, unless players in question are actively hostile to each other.
---
It's like having all the badass Lego sets.
---
You've got the medieval castles, the underwater structures and caves and junk. You've got the branded, theme ones like Lord of the Rings and He-Man. 
---
And then you just dump them all into a big bin, and play with all the pieces at once, never really making anything of substance but still having fun.
---
The chest is just a bunch of junk... if you can prove me wrong be my guest. I personally have yet to see anything worthwhile come from the chest.
---
First time was a breeze...i was like oke not to bad!
---
Easier than queen 
---
Second time 
---
I cried...
---
A lot.
---
Died alot 
---
Every time 60 sec waiting
---
No loot because of it
---
Spawned back when the hole was closed at the end of it
---
3rd time:
---
Infinite loading haha
---
This is an next tier event for sure
---
I believe you can load into another instance aswell as the pathway hasn’t opened (the second pathway that actually leads you to him) but I haven’t tested this out to be 100% certain but I do know if you lag out you can always join back on a friends name
---
Junky is a magic effect on a minigun, if I am not mistaken...
---
What the hell is this logic?
---
You couldn’t have walked away, faked him out and crouched behind something, or find a new server?? EDIT: Don’t know how the hell that offended some of you snowflakes. I’ve played this game since BETA. If somebody is following you meleeing you, I’m sure even somebody with a double digit IQ could figure out how to escape. Run into a building, close a door, use the second of extra time to fast travel. There’s a million ways. This guy just sounds incompetent and/or he made it up for karma
---
This is a reddit comment section where you were whining about casuals, not the debate club, if you can’t see the difference in between the 2 you might need to take your schizo medicine.
---
And *you're* on my blocklist now
---
Go through the responder quests and just keep going I think and I’d say level 20?
---
To be fair, this guy/gal/friend is just fighting for “mod lovers” to have the option like they did for many games before. I think it’s fair to stand for something like this.
---
Plus, mods can definitely put new life in old games. I thought I was finally done but getting mods for Skyrim dragged me back into it two years later.
---
Will 10k rounds of 2mm on a Vampire Gauss Mini  be enough, or should I keep farming ammo?
---
Come, on. Now you're not even trying
---
At least paid content like atom shop items should be on point 😒
---
There might be some more yet unnamed fixes. Best advice I can give: google for '2020 fo76 camp budget exploit', make a list of what turns up and go through that. Good luck, I hope you find the bugger.
---
I did say i have yet to experience it yet
---
Why all good sellers are everywhere but pc 😭 thanks for the offer tho, nice of you!
---
I play full health heavy guns so im usually stiming people just kinda feel like i should be when i use maybe a stimpack a day if that, drives me nuts when someone cant spare one for me especially in this kinda situation
---
Fact. console players never heard of elder scrolls or fallout till mod support came. Bears, beats, battle star galactica
---
You can only do this if another player shares that card with you.
---
These normally won't stack, and the highest rank takes effect, but there are a few that aren't set up to prevent this properly.
---
Ie: if you run Inspirational 3, and a teammate shares Inspirational 1, they will stack
---
I haven't played yet today, so I wasn't sure. Thanks for answering.
---
And i did say I do get major fps drops when tesla is being used
---
NICE
---
I played it once before work and it was fun,kept dying tho because I jumped into it without armour or decent weapons but it was good til I died at the same time as earl and couldn't find his body before I had to escape
---
I wasn’t trying from the start lol. You’re whining about casuals on a game made by a company that has made casual games for the past decade lol
---
I’d like that a lot. I took Grafton steel a dozen times before even realizing you could repair the vertibird pad. It’d be great for larger events to have that workshop and be able to call in some actual air support. Bring a unique asset to the fight. Mainly just the post-Queen mobs and the Colossus if it shows up afterward. Can’t think of any other times.
---
Litterly the worst quest ever because of how freaking accurate it was and I can say after 6 times of doing it it dosent get better lol
---
i remember the quest broke so i had to do it three times in one sitting
---
Survives entire event, deals 80% of damage. Goes to res a fellow Player as a Good Samaritan. Random roof falls on you during animation. 
---
Goodbye loot. 
---
I get risk vs reward but this is just bad mechanics.
---
Do you use them as your main under armour? What armour do you wear on top? I couldn’t find any armours that looked good on top of them
---
Level 318 or so? Male character with a long coat and mining helmet?
---
I never even heard of this until they patched it. Now I am excited to try it out. I am tired of my "brick accent walls" 😅
---
He just wanted my junk haha. Had to say bye to my junk shield and pack rat 😂 people have no shame sometimes, I swear. Especially when you show them kindness.
---
Run it properly.
---
Colossal Problem event dropped it for me.
---
Why would that be a perk? It should be default.
---
Have you tried storing and replacing it in your camp?
---
Played it twice, died once, both fights were tough but fair. 
---
I think I was lucky to have 8 100+ players in both fights, everyone was pulling their weight, though would have been nice to see a few more heavy weapons in there.
---
And if two people mostly focus on the spawns at all times it becomes cake
---
Yeah kinda lost its fun factor after double digits ;)
---
Ah, I better do some more of those then 😜
---
First of all, Workshops ARE for resources, PvP is a secondary function. 
---
Second, most of the time you will be left alone.  But if you want to take a workshop and you don't want to PvP here are some hints:
---
1. Crouch:  When you are crouched your icon doesn't show up on the map.
---
2. Store all of your junk before moving into a Workshop area.
---
3. Crouch before moving into the workshop area and then take the workshop.  Move to the edge of the green circle in a spot where you have cover and can "Run, Run away" if someone comes to challenge you for the workshop.
---
4. Usually you have time to get the resources running and set up the workshop.  Do this while crouched as much as possible.  There is a Welcome mat under Miscellaneous.  It is the fast travel point for Workshops.  Place it someplace that is hidden and has cover.  Also, put down a stash box and, if you have it, a Fallout 1st box near the resource machines.  That way you can store stuff as quickly as possible.
---
5. Usually you can do the first creature defend event without being bothered.  It occurs pretty quickly after you take the workshop.  Again, crouch as much as possible.
---
6. Leave the Workshop area.  Don't hang around.  Only come back at random intervals to pick things up and stash them.  Make sure to crouch before fast traveling before you do.
---
7. Don't do the rest of the defend events.  These are ideal times for ambushes.  You can randomly go back for the "Retake"events.  Just check to see if it is retaking it from creatures or an intruder.  An Intruder typically means PvP.  And make sure that you store all of your junk before you do.
---
And that's it.   I haven't had to PvP for a workshop for a long time now simply because doing the above makes it hard for PvP players to find and ambush you.
---
On a final sneaky note, if you want to take a workshop to just to grab and go, then try to find the owner on the map and wait until they are in an event.  The Queen SB fight or the new Collossus event are good examples.  Both can take a lot of time, both keeps people occupied, not looking at notifications, and gives you the time you need for the countdown and then count up when you challenge for a workshop.
---
I threw on action girl, ate 5 honeys, drank some canned coffee and ran like the wind. Buddy followed and the game takes so long to load the menu and then fast travel that he'd be able to catch up regardless of the distance I made
---
To a point i get lower levels being rat bastards but once you hit like level 60 you’re just being a douche lmao
---
I agree it should have been in since the start but I don't see them doing it now
---
Wait....these are instanced based....
---
You can set them to pick up weapons and ammo, but non legendary.
---
The way I do is get threw the laser Normal then pic mode glitch to the door thats to the damaged cores and pic mode threw that and boom you run up to the initiation room
---
Edit: you can do the PA glitch for the lasers as well but I’m not good at that
---
And don't forget, this event has been delayed multiple times. I swear they have 5 year-olds programming this game.
---
I ran it once so far. I didn't get the typical bug however the server crashed when Earl was at like 5%. Kind of a bummer but from what I experienced it was a fun event regardless. Hoping I get a successful run or two in sometime.
---
No problem I have done 4 times so far and only  1 fail  (I tried it with low levels lol ) got close but not enough dmg. Guaranteed 3* drop at end is worth though
---
Never logged out when I was online at reset. I actually enjoy seeing one daily after another pop up. Uncompleted btw. I did it so often that I don’t think it is actually related to this bug.
---
It’s just buggy, it’s very difficult to move without rebuilding.
---
My God, it worked.
---
Colossal Problem is on PS4?? 
---
Is that was the maintenance was earlier?
---
If you have a decent build you could solo this rather easily, don't even need bloodied or Junkies.
---
That should be good. I shredded through 5k rounds of 308 and 10 plasma cores.
---
Yessir. Ran one fine and second one glitched out. People reporting wendigo glitching under map too
---
Bad mechanics in that it is a made up scenario. We can imagine bad mechanics all we want. If you survived this event and were killed by debris that’s not bad mechanics that’s bad luck. The debris doesn’t even deal that much damage so why didn’t you stim yourself first? I know why, because it’s made up
---
Makes me wish there is a secret achievement where if you launch 100 nukes you a console in your camp to launch them
---
Only event where I got lucky and got atleast two of each plan. I have a feeling the next few events are going to be ruthless for me
---
If your level 50 your guns should be equivalent to his, although at that level you know the dude prob has a full legendary build. Personally i have a strictly PVE build and most of them have PVP builds but yeah i feel you, I had 2 level 200+ come attack me at my base when i was level like 25 and my base is in the middle of butt fck nowhere. Some people have no life its insane
---
FYI you don’t have to escape the tunnel. You can continue killing/looting wendigos. Once the timer runs out you’ll be transported outside of the cave. If you die after dark dies stay near the entrance of the cave to still receive event rewards.
---
You have to mod the armor to get it to 53/53/53. The mod is buttressed
---
Fuck I nutted at this
---
Did you have a mod on the old one?
---
Lol I’m a complete idiot. Thanks.
---
I would recommend giving it a try, it’s actually a pretty cool experience. You also get some good rewards. Just make sure you have a strong team and lots of ammo like I said.
---
Nice! Can’t wait to try it, might drop a nuke soon as I get home.
---
Buttressed mod applied
---
Other side : [https://imgur.com/eLHEVqR](https://imgur.com/eLHEVqR) (11/27/18) 🙂
---
Even if you could put stuff in, if you drop bullion items, they get destroyed, so someone else wouldn't be able to pick them up.
---
Is your gauss mini magic? If so, you could do it with 10K rounds.
---
Lol, well, one low level in the party doesn't seem like too much a risk. A whole party of lower levels would be understandable to tap out of. 
---
I'm sure everyone is just excited and wants to try. I see no reason to be angry about it is all.
---
West teck walls and doors are glossy now. I think they did it to reduce texture load.
---
I highly doubt you will be banned for playing with them. They barely get banned themselves. If anything just report them and move on.
---
They barely even ban the people exploiting so I doubt it.
---
You must be pretty lucky. It could also be what people are doing online during the reset. Maybe like fast travelling does it or something idk so if you're logged off, you wouldn't be able to do those actions during the reset. I have no clue though
---
Well that's just life inside this game, you get used to it to the level it doesn't surprise me anymore.
---
Players = $ for Bethesda what do you think?
---
Im either playing with some people who have ass damage or this boss has too much health.
---
Lol yes. Total brain fart. That’s the answer.
---
must have been there stash, or a dupe glitch 
---
because the mini gun never drops with the prime modification
---
I'm a bloodied stealth melee build. No pikes of ammo and I'd be playing with ransoms. Doesn't sound like fun lol.
---
People preparing to do the event: Don't.
---
It was probably a really good magical weapon. 🤔
---
Yep. I’m an idiot. Thanks.
---
Have someone been using Tesla rifle?
---
Because it leaves ash piles that currently cut your FPS for each pile around you. And I would be very surprised that they don't know it themselves...
---
If my character has 30+ intellect thanks to being a bloody unyielding build then you can be damn sure he can figure out how to hack the DMV.
---
This should have been an option, easily.
---
Tesla rifle ash piles?
---
Has that idiotic damage nerf to everything dropped as well?
---
Nah I didn’t mind lol it wasn’t my keycard and I have over 30k bullets but I wouldn’t do it again I didn’t expect him to be so spongy and have like 20 glowing wendis around but good luck when you try
---
I may do this when I hop off for the night, i got a tenderizer day one but sadly no plan yet.
---
Secret service if you have access to vault 79, but plans with gold bullion
---
Check out Angry Turtle's YouTube channel. He has lots of info on overpowered builds and weapons.
---
Of course that's made up. It's to outline that high risk high reward doesn't cover this. You could be the most MVP player at the event and then lose out on looting Earle and the Chest because of bad luck. That's the point! One slip and you lose everything even if you were the highest contributor. 
---
That's not high risk high reward that's rng haha
---
Why a furious lever? I find it blows anything away in a shot or two max, even tanky things. Maybe you should look for an aa or instigating there too.
---
Sounds like you might have used the camp budget exploit, because they fixed that this patch.
---
that's a pretty fucking talented 5 year old, not gonna lie.
---
I mean it wasn't me who got it, so I can't say for certain, but he mentioned it as soon as we got to the chest so I don't know why he would just say that :P
---
Again I don't wanna confirm it myself tho, because it wasn't me that got it and all
---
You sound pretty sure of yourself. Wanna test your mettle? By all means take a video of yourself doing the event solo, then come back and tell me it was easy.
---
Shit! to much details.
---
Is there a special random reward for killing the WC?
---
Didn't use my mini, and the magic effect appears to be linked to secondaries effects like increased bashing damage and some others, not primaries. All my junkies are either one star or +10% damage while aiming. Its also a fairly obvious thing, it cascades quickly. All the damage I did was just steady chipping away, no accelerated drops in health like a magic does.
---
Ah, great. Lol! I better stock up on ammo before I give it a shot. Lol. Thanks for wishing me luck.
---
Only thing worthwhile about this post is OP's handle.
---
For rifles I would suggest maxing out your rifleman perks. 
---
I’m no melee expert, so I’ll let others weigh in on that. 
---
Bloody Mess in Luck for 15% extra damage output will also help.
---
okay, sorry, I just thought it was from my one attempt. Maybe I was lucky.
---
Totally forgot about those. I was thinking of saving up for that T-65, but I might reconsider.
---
Might have been, but then again, would have no idea because I couldn’t see what was going on lmao
---
Best I could do is a couple thousand rounds of 556, a B3325 Handmade, no power armor, and a full set of unyielding urban scout armor. 
---
(Managed to solo the queen with this bloodied stealth commando build, I’m not too worried about Earl. He probably won’t even see me coming.)
---
There is a list with all armor specs and which combos are best for DR/ER/RR.  
---
But once yo do wastelanders and go for bullion.  No other armor is comparable to SS.
---
I cannot stress enough how little interest I have in this event.
---
I didn’t like most of the missions of this game. It’s all “go here and get this” or “go there and get that”. It gets pretty old when there is no real challenge, just busy work.
---
Watch the Video from SHGames, how to solo the Event.
---
I started my set, got the jetpack for the chest, I really like it.
---
I will also keep doing the event. Best of luck to the both of us.
---
I think it should be level locked to 100+.
---
 Even then, you're not guaranteed people with optimized gear/builds. 
---
But it's better than 3 people under level 50 who just keep dying.
---
Second time someone recommended Secret Service Armor. I think you guys are on to something lol
---
I got two
---
I have YET to get a single jetpack. I think I'll go for it.
---
That's good to hear I can remember my base getting nukd too many times by a Mirv fat man that got extremely mad at the game for that thank you for informing me on this
---
Ok. So now we are imagining all the ways the event could possibly go wrong so that we can say the event is flawed. Got it. 
---
You’re fighting the enemies and the environment until the end of the event. If you die you die, if you complete the event you complete the event. Simple as that. The game is easy enough as it is, I welcome the difficulty. I wish there was more of it
---
Mine seems like it works about 25% of the time, I think VATS is just super messed up right now and probably will be for a while.
---
Nope, next patch.
---
I'm gonna try to do the event as much as possible before then, so I don't have to touch it again
---
Same here... sigh
---
That with marsupial and speed demon makes travel pretty fun.
---
I am allowed to play HOW I WANT, and it's presumptuous as fuck to suggest otherwise.
---
(PS4) I too had a lag storm of a go at this. I dont think I would have died half as much if I wasn't lagging out, but I definitely still would have died some.
---
I ran it twice and had none of those issues, worked great honestly. I had zero lag/sound delay and stimpaks worked fine. I’m not gloating, just reporting my experience (on XB1).
---
Finally, now people can quit whinging about it.
---
I promise you he will.
---
Watch the SHGames Video, he explains how to solo it very easy.
---
what a sad life
---
I’m on Xbox. I have a bunch of awesome guns worth more than 30k caps.  I’ll trade with you.
---
Yet another dupe glitch incoming in 3...2...1...
---
Did you happen to not let them tag a legendary on prime cuts? Cause that’s the type of shit I do haha
---
I drop them as soon as I get them now.
---
Personally I found it to be the most realistic quest ever. Whichever developer fabricated that one must have just gone for license renewal.
---
Stealth rifleman with Chinese stealth armor is tons of fun to play , I one shot basically everything and radiation isn’t an issue ever
---
The event is really rough, if you have a level 14 it means you need a level 600 to balance out
---
I've been dealing with jackasses since beta. You are right coalition is probably the griefer and followed you to reddit.
---
I need those plans I'm on xbox one and I have the tenderizer plan
---
Yeah. Very annoying that each little piece displayed is a sliver of budget.
---
I shot him a few times with an explosive weapon but the damage was the same as the non-explosive weapon I also had. It's also tankier than the Queeen as I do half the damage.
---
I actually just quit the game and logged in again and it was gone
---
Yes best of luck
---
People with huge filled camps have used a camp budget glitch to increase their limit.
---
Telling people to play their way while saying at the same time your way to play is the way to play, is just ironic as hell.
---
Talk to me about semantics, it's priceless.
---
Ah well. I wish you a good one. Maybe I get tired of the bethesda lazyness. That would be fine if this was not the current almost only things to do... this and grind millions of cork or whatever junk it is  (!)
---
I still have hope for Daily ops. For ones, there is a real content there.
---
What's your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. looking like? I can figure out what perks you have going on with your build, I'm sure.
---
Yeah they only drop if you learn the plans.  
---
Got a Gauss Minigun quite recently that way.
---
It’s simple as to why you didn’t succeed, all the people in your lobby weren’t bloodied! /s
---
I don't think you'll be able to get a high bounty anymore. Someone will come and burn you down quick.
---
Ohhh I misunderstood what you were saying sorry 
---
Deleted my reply I did 
---
That's weird haha, but something like this did happen before 
---
It's almost certainly a bug, some other bundle in the past had a similar problem, I don't think they would try and trick people in a way that that's obvious 
---
Does the bundle say anywhere that it's supposed to have a discount tho? It's possible they may just be bundling of together for the convenience of a one time click buy for multiple items. That would be a bummer, but unless they are legit advertising a discount that's not there, I don't think there's any malevolence going on
---
Not sure I'll have room for my other perks. But I can try.
---
My favorite thing to do when some PVP schmuck is trying to get me to turn off Pacifist and wallop him is to just give the "confused" emote until they leave.
---
They get too frustrated to continue engaging, as they typically are just looking for a quick kill with their Bloodied one shot builds to show off how big their e-dick is, so stalling is the worst thing you can do to them. I just laugh at the amount of bullets they waste trying to provoke me.
---
It's interesting to realise there must be a whole underground community of people figuring these dupes out and selling the results for real $$$, probably making quite a bit and 99% of people are completely unaware. Were all just blissfully ignorant playing this fun little video game while other people are raking in the monies.
---
I've seen people aim for the town instead of the mine a couple times.
---
They probably test it but it’s on fresh hardware with nothing else installed and on an internet connection that is rock solid in regards to connection, ping, packet loss, and any other glitch that causes disconnects.
---
You need to [EQUIP] it in the Atomic Store, and then **move** your camp (ergo: make a new camp) for the skin to show up. And yes, it should have been fixed with today's patch, assuming it's the same as last week's PC patch.
---
My point is more of the fact that you should try and avoid dying, for example, I’m a bloodied melee build so get really close and I now have to back when he gets super low
---
18 plasma cores was all I used in three fights all wins  , I get that people are excited but this much hype for a meh fight is a bit much.
---
Agreed I loved that mode, that's mainly how I got my aid items and junk but they got rid of it because foodbuilds complained about the PVP in it.
---
No, but the top of the tower in Foundation has quite a setup. They could put her there.
---
9 14 1 1 5 15 11 , something like that
---
Magic shotguns work for 99% of the content. Great for speed farming the SCORE / dailies and crap. They are totally useless against SBQ and Colossus. I just swap between unyielding SS + Magic Shotgun for regular gameplay and T-65 + junkies gauss minigun for boss killing.
---
If you wanna use more magic weapons, a high fire rate weapon with inc limb damage mod will insta-kill anything, including SBQ/Colossus. If you wanna take the legit route, just go Junkies heavy weapons, its more challenging.
---
If they fix the bugs this event will easily be the funniest one
---
A LEVEL 14 CANNONT DO AN EVENT DESIGNED FOR PLAYERS OVER 100! YOU ABSOLUTE IMBECILE HE GETS ONE TAPPED BY EVERYTHING!
---
Nah, complete rando who came to my camp a few mins after I logged in
---
It was probably a mule, dude.
---
Whats a mule?
---
It was kind of a waste of time. It’s the only thing I’ve been looking forward to in game for a while now. Beat it first try, didn’t break stealth with my bloodied commando build. Wasn’t even hard.
---
Does it make you feel better to type in caps and call people names? 
---
Fuck right off.
---
A donkey
---
Oh, man! I don't think I'd be able to go that low with Endurance and Charisma. The prices on this game are RIDICULOUS! But I'm sure I'll look into that.
---
I have a feeling that it was probably someone on their mule. The handmade gifts were duped like crazy a while back so there are some people who have insane amounts of gifts/caps because of it.
---
Then he should have experimented with his own nuke
---
Ah I see.
---
I'm the griefer?? Ahahaha
---
Definitely harder than SBQ but the colossus pathing is easy to learn. As a mediocre junkie stealth commando build using a furious handmade worked really well. Finished the event with 10 mins on clock. There were two PA heavys, at least two other stealth commandos, and I believe a unarmed melee and a person attracting the Wendigo spawn attention. I started with 1/3 of my health in rads. At the end I had half health. I did use plenty of Stims but with first aid 2* it works very well. As long as everybody learns from others and help each other out this event can be done well. I used about 3k ammo, about 35 stims. If someone’s doing the event solo or with a bunch of less experienced players it could go south quick. As someone whose played from the beta to now I’ve got to say that this event is one of the most engaging and entertaining things in a long time
---
Really, thats cool!
---
You can select if you use the normal dome or the one w/o foundation! And then you just have to allign it with a door, so you can use it as "room"
---
I’m level 112, pretty solid bloodied melee build
---
It’s helpful. People tend to blame Bethesda when the issue is actually on their end. It’s tough for Anyone to fix personal hardware issues that effect fo76 performance.
---
Does it make you feel better to not use a single neuron in your fucking brain?! How's manual breathing going for you?!
---
Your missing a big point on this. You cannot gain access to the spoils of fighting if your unlucky enough to die at the last minute of the event even if you were the single highest contributor to the events completion due to the ridiculous respawn timer of 60 seconds and an auto kick from the event with no way of returning. Doesn't happen at the queen. You can rock up way after the event ends and still get your loot. 
---
As for calling it difficult yeah it is but it's not the difficulty it's the time sensitive problem of when you die. You could die 20 times during the event and still get all rewards. Die in the final minute you are punished. Not very fair. 
---
If you honestly think that this mechanic is Risk vs Reward rather than a problem, then carry on. I predict this will go in circles for quite sometime.
---
A character used for holding onto stuff.
---
They can drop from certain quests and from the Purveyor Mystery Pick. They dont actually drop from legendary enemies.
---
Ya, I just failed it. Someone dropped a nuke on Earle and no one showed up.
---
Username checks out.
---
You’ll need to time you’r hits good since the screech but what your psn
---
How exactly do you do it?
---
I found myself on the central raised platform with the railings in the middle of the room at my last time. It proved a good vantage point for taking on Earle and the spawn, and the bonus was that the railing caught me every time there was a screech attack so I didn’t panic run anywhere.
---
No.  There’s a bit of exaggeration going on, or the OP isn’t specced out for DPS.  It’s challenging, but if you have a half decent weapon and a solid build you’ll be fine.  I carried the event with two &gt;60lvl teammates using a one star junkies gauss mini and a solid DPS build in about 12 minutes.
---
How did you only die in once? I must have died 15 times during it and used about 3k 5.56 on a BE handmade. Level 286 here
---
Hm. I just finished them and it started me on the BoS quests with going to the bunkers and stuff? Last I did was going around Fort Defiance
---
Worst part of that mission is all the level 68 charred ferals. Easy enough for higher level characters but i went into it at level 22. Ended up needing help from several other players to finish cause 20 some level 68 ghouls is enough to make a person rage quit
---
I've run it a few times and like a lot of things, completely dependent on who shows up for the event. I've learned that it's better to just log off than to try to make things work with a bunch of people cowering in a corner scared to attract Earle's attention and that can't be bothered to shoot at the wendigos swarming me.
---
Ah yes, my damn curiosity would have too. That pesky little thing
---
Can you cripple it?
---
Lol yeah it does
---
yeah, I'm hoping people are still showing up tonight for the meat cook. Earle isn't going anywhere, but Meat Week is leaving in a few days.
---
Congrats on the solo. You do know that junkies is a magic effect right?
---
Just wait until it works, but when you die the respawn is 60 seconds. Nucking futs.
---
All the tenderizer plans are the same rarity
---
No coalition I'm at work and was being lazy
---
Hello member. I am agent "Egg"
---
Here at the enclave we believe our nukes should only be used for the good of the american people. Let me clarify; was the attack warranted? I assume positive intent so:
---
If the attack was unwarranted i will happily rebuild your homestead for you. At a price. Just your soul.
---
Happy hunting members,
---
Egg.
---
Ps: i can help you if needed but im at work til 5 :)
---
rustysporks69 - I found when I did the event earlier, the melee build was spectacular for clearing the spawn hordes and then dealing some damage to earle every now and then
---
In the 8 people stance, three of us were dealing enough damage and 5 were just dying all the time. My bloodied railway has taken half of the lifebar in about 8'
---
To make the boss harder... To make a possibility that you fail the event.
---
You can't always win.
---
Sounds fine I’ll send it I’m a silo rn
---
Secret service armor with uny and app refresh is so good it’s not even close
---
I've had really bad luck with teams so far. Only managed to complete it twice so far. Rewards weren't really worth the ammo I spent on it. Plus every 23 and his mother try and join an event clearly not meant for them.
---
[Stupid sexy Scorchbeast](https://imgur.com/gallery/FTPW9bU)
---
Wait, this is out on consoles now?
---
That would be such a cool fucking addition.
---
The escape is great but I really like that initial drop down the mine shaft. How can I say...feels very badass...and is cinematic like the escape.
---
Kid, I have much better things to do than argue with someone whose balls haven't dropped. Have a nice day.
---
I understood that reference. But yeah, I don't wanna waste my keycards triggering the damn thing if it's just not going to work.
---
On PC I just use a Vampire .50 cal and maybe one or two stimpacks and maybe 3 or 4K of bullets, getting staggered is the annoying part by the mobs.
---
Yup
---
The last 20 levels I’ve been running around with only 1 Endurance; Lead Belly rank 1 for 30% less rads from eating and drinking (I believe that’s the one). Potentially 4 point to redistribute for you. 
---
Even with the increased hunger and thirst from speed demon mutation it’s very manageable.
---
Honestly not surprised bloody builds are thriving in this with how ridiculously busted they are.
---
If you have at least 40 caps, just "move" your camp, even if it's just one step over. It'll repair everything. Only thing you'll have to do is put everything back down.
---
It’s not worth doing until they fix these problems. Unless you’re okay with wasting resources for the experience of seeing what it looks like I’d stay away from it, much like the vault raids when they first released.
---
Before SS armor all other armor where somewhat similar spec wise with one set was used for more RR or DR or ER.  
---
With SS armor u get all 3.  Its hands down the best to get. No questions.
---
It's not that bad, plus the wendigos drop ammo for whatever weapon you kill them with  (except fuel, grenades, and fusion cores, and prime ammo) I actually walked out of my last run with more 2mm ammo than I came in with lol
---
Help would be appreciated but I gues it would be hard cause I don't think you happen to be in the European time zone
---
I am a huge fan of the SS, especially on my Bloodied commando, but the Vault armor is pretty compelling for other builds.  I love the Solar for my Junkie.
---
Ohhh I didn't realize that! Thanks
---
It’s kinda the point though. Devs will see this and think, “Mission Accomplished!!”
---
It’s like Animal Crossing, the “Sea bass? More like C+” schtick.. they were trolling us intentionally.
---
Realy? Didn't think it would be that easy thanks for the advice
---
Wow!
---
I wish I could give them the benefit of the doubt but the way they are priced individually you’d be paying 1450 if you bought them separately compared to 1000 if you individually bought the red rocket or blood eagles items that are the same item with different skins. They aren’t advertising a discount but they are making the bundle “cheaper” by raising the prices of each item when bought individually but that in itself is another scam because the same items in other sets aren’t as expensive
---
They're for resources too.  Most people won't be dicks and take them but some will and you just gotta accept it if you aren't the PVP type.  Fallout 1st helps with workshops though, no one to mess with your stuff.  You can get some really good XP chains going with a team of 4 and a bunch of workshops constantly under attack by NPC squads.
---
I picked it up years ago with ESO and always assumed it was for 'cartoon'. It's just another way of saying character really.
---
No sir/ma'am. It's be quite late 2h 40m from now. If no help arrives, offer stands. 
---
You happen to catch who nuked you? I collect keycards for this reason 0.o
---
Yes let's make you wait a while minute to make the boss harder that doesn't make it harder it just makes it more annoying
---
Bro you literally ask questions on how to operate your fucking Keurig get your boomer lvl 14 ass outta here.
---
You still in the silo? Is there time for me to join with a friend?
---
Captainnoob has a great guide in this event for stealth commandos with his help I was able to solo the event with an Unyeilding Ap Harder to detect scout set and B 2525 Handmade if you watch his guide and have decent gear you should be fine
---
You got time I’m planning to drop three since the server I’m in is clean what’s psn?
---
Oh sorry misunderstood what you were sayin
---
PS4 no SSD and it's bad for me. The first hour after the update it was not even playable. I could barely walk, barely load the menu to exit the game, changing servers didn't help. It's a little better now but still laggy.
---
matthewcoop ye I'm on rn
---
Honestly I don't see how mods could improve much aside from like maybe some UI stuff, I don't think they would be the big game changer for this particular game that they are for the other games
---
Sadly I don't know but I think I found a solution for my camp but thanks anyways good to know that I can rely on this community
---
Finally, someone with the guts to speak up about this.
---
I've seen a few drop here and there at Primal. Don't forget the snallys and shit that spit ranged acid. I'm sure if serendipity procs etc it's all good.
---
Haha, true
---
Place down a door that you want. Then you place a wall in the exact same spot. Then you replace the door with a wall by using the replace/scrap/store feature. Then you can wallpaper both sides.
---
I sent it
---
After fort defiance it’ll make you go to like a military camp cause you need to get a govt issued ID to get into the BoS elevator, you’re almost there friend, I pray for you
---
Ward: Finally someone with guts to help
---
Also, since whitesprings is another incredibly common place to nuke, just make sure to check your map whenever someone launches a nuke.
---
I had two people on separate occasions buying out my vendor with faschnacht masks. I don't know what are these people expect, when it took me months to sell them on the default (10-15 cap) price.
---
Have fun and dont bring your tesla
---
Will do thanks
---
I'm 1 for 2. The second time, which was on a different server, but only 15 minutes later, I ran out of ammo on my 3 best guns. We also failed cuz there was only 3 of us, a lvl 50, 90, and me at 465. 
---
My tip: bring extra extra ammo and repair your weapons to 200% before you join.
---
I actually dumped some points into this on the PTS the other day and did some tests. I tried using it with Fury and Psycho, but they wouldn't stack. I also had rank 4 to see if it made a better chem than "MK 1," but it only generated that version for me. Seems like the perk is just a way to generate a regular source of off-brand Fury, nothing more.
---
If you like challenging events, it's the best right now
---
Fo76 is hit or miss.
---
The filthy casuals/ pkoa communities are the best. Hands down nicest in Appalachia.
---
What materials are you short for the fix? (Im quite sure i can direct you to proper resource locations)
---
Ok I'm joining now. My other friend isn't doing anymore lol
---
I know and I respect the troll, but I’m still gonna rage
---
Do you use atom shop floors? I use the astroturf and my budget shot up with the patch
---
Just level 110 here and I don’t run power armor, I cycle between a vampires Gatling and a .50 cal, use the former against the spawns and it keeps me alive, use the .50 to rip through the boss.
---
I do run Barbarian and the agility one at the same time for lots of bonus defense. 
---
I did die one more time than that but my armor revived me.
---
Must be nice this is the fifth time Earle has sunk into the floor for me.
---
Was the worst technical experience of this game for me, absolutely demolished me ears through the worst audio I’ve heard from a game, the frame rates were lower than I’ve ever experienced, and then crashing after the event completed is just the icing on top. Utter embarrassment and I’m running on an Xbox one X with the fastest available internet in the area and using a wired connection
---
But I love my tesla.
---
Sounds fine
---
It wasn't easy. But it is possible https://youtu.be/TV5FkTrNQc8
---
&gt; Why a furious lever?
---
for my commando its a sniping rifle.. even with instigating its not 1shotting anything that isnt weak af to begin with being Im not speced into it..
---
for my main Rifleman.. I use it indoors or when sneak breaks or for spongey bosses.. otherwise Im using a Instigating Hunting/Sniper Rifle most of the time.. or a Mutants Handmade I have for low level areas and events
---
the third toon is a combo of the other 2 for use on the test server.. I can swap between the commando or Rifleman perks to see how each of my other builds will do with new content.. that is why I need a Furious Lever 
---
thanks for asking
---
That sucks, i didn't even have Earle on the map tho. I think there was like 4 or 5 of us
---
Like I said don’t complain about it when the game was designed that any lvl player can join
---
It seems to be. The experience of Fallout 76 on the Xbox is horrible. I honestly don’t know how MS originally certified this game. I played since the beta on an Xbox One X getting to level 250+. The game would regularly bug out and go to single digit frames per second. It’s a horrible experience and something I never want to deal with again.
---
Yeah. I know what you mean. I'm on Xbox.
---
GT Marble Cat.
---
We really could have used those detonators.
---
Just like butter
---
I did it with two other guys and died three times (bloodied build). I don't think it's so hard
---
I don’t run any quality of life cards
---
I mean it takes 10min to run it no glitching.
---
Did this over the weekend and couldn't be happier, however my ammo reserves are not happy.
---
Scrap 'em, there's even a bench next to the critter chunk turn in; use the wood for a future cookout.
---
I just get kinda frustrated cuz ppl say modders could make the game so much better but never how they actually could
---
Like yes "fixes" and "choice" and shit, but like what specifically do you expect modders to do to make the game great if they were given the tools to do so? 
---
I'm genuinely curious to hear what people think the game could be with mods but it's always so vague, almost like they just imagine mods are some kind of stuff of miracles that will suddenly "maek bad gaem gud"
---
I don't. I like camp building and Meat Week.
---
I've yet to even see a chest.
---
Well, that's dumb.
---
I ended up closing game and coming back on pissed, and when I get back on I have the two legendary drops and junk items. I got the cursed harpoon and a furious 40% +1 agility sledge hammer. So not bad
---
The problem with bloodied is not that they are OP, it is that they are too tanky, that is where they should have hit them. 
---
I run full unyielding sentinels, with evasive, dodgy and blocker I can stand in the middle of a horde of ghouls and barely take any damage.
---
Realy everything I'm not to good with getting scrap in 76 I don't know if I just don't know the tricks or I'm doing something wrong but anyway I don't really have much of anything on the other hand I'm just like lv 30
---
Trade?
---
There's a chest?
---
Got disconnected joining back rn
---
Accurate.. level 300+ players have been toxic all meat week
---
Could have just combat logged and jumped servers....
---
Really? I've gotten a couple a piece of the others but no tenderizer itself.
---
I mean nsfw mods are already in online games, if it's all client side it has no effect on the rating :p
---
Hundreds of stims? You must be pretty weak
---
Gotcha. I mean: when you go to your CAMP module and hit triangle/y it shows how much of what mats u need.
---
E.g.: 0/18 wood, 3/20 steel ECT.
---
Edit: if you tell me which mats you need ill pinpoint how to get them fast. Alternative thought, i could help you relocate in the "no nuke" safe zone.
---
Definitely not your build mate it's something in the game. It's like it *has* to turn your character into a beacon.
---
They can drop for events like Fasnacht Parade.
---
Agreed. How is anything over level 100 desperate?  Lol.  I was level 45 on my latest character when I got a gun that I'm still using at level 79 and murdering everything in sight (my point being that it's extremely easy once you get "that weapon" that meshes with your character build perfectly).  And these guys with hundreds of levels come around and kill you nigh instantly.  That's not PVP, that's just stepping on a bug.  Much wow.  Many impress.  Every of the awes.
---
Busted or not I died a lot, and in this event that's a high risk
---
My biggest problem is dying to rads when the event is over because I’m not a PA user haha but yeah the respawn times for this event is too long specially since it’s very easy to die
---
I'll send ya an invite. Llamafromhell38
---
Player name?
---
Same man. If it's not glitched into the floor or ceiling its the lack of DPS that kills the run.
---
I know but it's like 30 Metall 50 wood and such I don't have the whole numbers as I'm currently participating in an event
---
I always love explaining the joke to the Europeans in my Discord
---
I use an explosive one.
---
If there's three players playing the drums before the event starts it really shortens the event because their playing ticks up the meter during the 2 minute countdown.
---
I sometimes forget it’s an American thing
---
Alt character of a duper. Those presents were duped.
---
Then you're right ignoring it. Meat Week is fun too
---
I have everything from Meat Week except the Salty Plan... so I’m trying not to be salty about it
---
That isn’t a defensive problem. It’s poorly lvl’d enemies. All it takes is a few seconds against earl to realize this isn’t true
---
I run this event with my tanky shotgunner build and its a blast. I'll go around and kneecap the wendi's or peel some off a heavy gunner, and then farm them once Earle gets pulled to the other side of the room. 
---
Go in with as little weight as possible as you usually come out encumbered from all of the screws and adhesive you looted.
---
Watched people die an assload and come right back in...not seeing any risk there?
---
What do you mean same items in other sets?
---
What would happen if I used the duped presents?
---
Would I get banned or anything?
---
Ok that explains why I didn’t know about it I am saving wastelanders until I finish the main quest (just have I Am Become Death left and tried to solo it - those robots kicked my ass). Thanks for the info!
---
Cool. I'll be on tomorrow morning. I'll try to get on your server when you are next on.
---
You were a low level once too, daring to dream.
---
Nah
---
True. The sad part is that this is how you get really nice stuff( which I still don’t really have a build build.) our squad can take out the queen no problem.  All this event is, is just a waste of ammo and keycards
---
I would gues duped cuz the weapons are primed. And coincidently they all seem to be bloodied as well. I dont know how you could make the collectron gather SOECIFIC stuff from a different table.
---
All weapons r gone get nerfed because of the way they calculate your total damage w the modifiers u have
---
Same weapon, but learning the plan gives you the ability to craft them and the chance to get Legendary drops.
---
Ya but arnt there still ones alive since before the war in fallout 3?
---
3rd party dupe probably.
---
Love that mission. Makes me laugh every single time!!
---
Done it 7 times now.. hahahah
---
Obviously I wasn’t using hundreds of stims. But your health goes down pretty quickly during this fight as you’re taking consistent damage from multiple factors. So you end up using a lot of stimpaks either way.
---
I held little hope of successful cook outs tonight, but seems to have struck lucky. 3 nukes in total, but all timed perfectly to allow players to attend the cook out too. Plenty attended both, no fails.
---
Hoping its the same tomorrow.
---
Lol get fucked 🗑
---
Who knows. Probably not but the risk is not zero. Safest bet is to destroy them.
---
What type of gun do you use?  I currently run a rifleman, with an explosive fixer. Would switching it over increase damage?  I was also thinking about switching to a shotgun build but I’m guess it’ll have to be one or the other.  My shotgun is pretty nice though, can tackle just about anything
---
Oh, that explains a lot!
---
You don't have to have PA.  If it's the radiation then just slip the radsuit on before you exit.  The Wendigos'are easily managed with taking out their legs and while Earl does hurt, don't just stand there.
---
Then you won’t get much enjoyment out of the game, let alone one event. You know meat week is a yearly thing right?
---
Ya near the end by screen gets grainy and it lags like hell.
---
One of my colleagues is white and he got looks from going to rural America with his Latino wife and biracial kids.  It's not racist to ppimt out that it can happen.
---
Question for you. Do you have the plans for that gear unlocked or not?
---
Red rocket garage and the blood eagle nest were both only 500 when they came out they are essentially the same items with different skins and I think they might even be bigger to be honest that bunker dome is 700 and it’s smaller
---
Just seems strange to dupe bullion items that you can't ever trade. Why would they ever need more than one on the character? There's something else going on here...
---
Just my luck then.
---
I might keep them but ill take your word for it. I havent heard of anyone getting banned for duped items yet.
---
All I want from the event is the stupid plushy. I've got plenty of flux and the weapons don't interest me. I'm using a prime Furious Faster Fire Rate Guass minigun and still my group is still struggling to kill him.
---
I know that. I am wondering, how bad will it be compared to other weapons
---
Gotcha: metal. 
---
Go to vault tec ag center in the forest. Kill robots, take metal. If you still need more, equip scrapper in int if you have it, go to New gad. Kill all super mutants and get guns gunpowder and caps for scrapping them (Theres a workbench or two somewhere in NG.
---
If you didnt get enough wood by then, go to a place up in toxic valley called "prickets fort". Tons of woodpiles.
---
Keep me posted.
---
Oh no.... lol
---
Yea please dont, the tesla bugs the game out right now and screws with frames
---
Ahh thanks I been wondering what’s up with that. As I use my Tesla on and off lol
---
Good point. Maybe since they are on the collectron and people like you can grab them, they arange for people to pay for them and then he tells them to go grab it?
---
My B2525 would love a suppressor
---
I had tried for 2 hours to get back into the game a bit after 10 this Mornin when I seen people posting that they where In &amp; doing the Colossal Problem,(which Is apparently a Colossal Problem)...
---
But I just keep getting a server error sayin Vault Tec is working on it Blahzay,blah
---
Was bummed for a second,until all the posts started coming through about the bugs &amp; glitches etc...
---
Took the kids to the park for a bit,time waaaaay better spent.
---
I’ll try again later &amp; see if I can’t participate in the glitch fest,hopefully a few of my friends I play wit are on then as well.
---
Stay Blessed Ya’ll
---
Edit:too autocorrect,autocorrect
---
I was looking for solid one and found a b2525 one in a vendor
---
"Just make sure you bring a lotta bullets!"
---
There is a difference between a single duped weapon and a stack of duped items. Bethesda has definitely banned players for having stacks of duped items or many multiples of the same item. 
---
Either use them now and hope or destroy them. Holding onto them is the worst option.
---
Nice to see that I'm not alone in thinking it's the most annoying quest in the game.
---
One of the most memorable quests ever for me. Lol
---
Same boat lol it hits hard in sneak you just get found to easily
---
instead its getting nothing, and a nerf lmao.
---
I'm on usually from 12pm to 12am EST due to virus
---
It's not permanent?
---
I have the gauss mini and plasma caster, but only SS left and right arms. There were chest and leg SS pieces in there, plus the gauss shotty, and I don't know any of those.
---
Ace did say it would be easier for him to just steal supplies.
---
Mine too
---
Big Bertha needs a milking
---
I loved when my European friends asked me what a DMV is. I told them it's basically exactly what happens in the game. It's not THAT far off.
---
Took about 3 minutes for mine to download but then about 45 to install. Idk wtf happened
---
I hated it, I hate every mission that inlcudes tight spaces (with easy to stuck on objects) and swarming ferals. But not gonna lie, I got a little bit nostalgic over it:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtEkUmYecnk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtEkUmYecnk)
---
&gt; and the chance to get Legendary drops
---
which is exactly why Ill sell it if I get one.. no need to learn that and have them start popping at the purveyor.. no thanky.. lol
---
I agree. It totally takes away the momentum. The boss is hard enough, there's no need for a death penalty
---
Earle isn't too awful if it were just him... but the swarms of level 75 wendigos make it pretty damn challenging.
---
Very intersting indeed.
---
The only gun I want is a ffr either handmade or ar.  Can’t find either and nobody will trade.  Have 13k caps for one somebody doesn’t  use anymore and at least 5 3*s I could throw in but it’s always a no
---
Cheers
---
Yeah it’s not far off at all it’s 100% spot on. That’s probably why I hate it so much lol
---
So dozens would be more accurate?
---
Angry Turtle and Mitzee duo'd it in 30 seconds
---
Do you use multiple small generators rather than a big one? Bethesda recently changed the camp budget on small generators.
---
Ace must have been hittin' that nukashine.
---
If you do, I'll take it off your hands.
---
If it was good before the nerf it will still be good after it. Bloodied and Junkies will still be the go to DPS builds
---
I don't really see how that's a scam? 
---
Different chairs and stuff that do the same thing are priced differently 
---
Power Armor skin prices are all over the place and are functionally identical 
---
Wallpapers etc 
---
They just arbitrarily set the prices on the items, there's never been an established rule that one type of item has to be a certain price
---
Are you on ps4? I'd buy it
---
The audio could use some work. It’s extremely loud and extremely glitchy, but other than that so far I’ve had no issues at all.
---
Every BBQ I've played has been over in like 30 seconds due to people drumming and roasting early. I don't even have to AFK, I just fast travel there, run a lap around the area "looking for critters" and boom, it's over. If I see an empty drum when I arrive, I'll definitely hop on it.
---
I know, but i wanted to make sure that a je gat plaz would still be good
---
And a fucking front sight
---
Earl is harder than the queen. Many many more hp.
---
Or you hit the loot box before getting the loot spawn
---
Ah yes forgot about that
---
That old bug doesn't just magically choose all your most expensive gear, it was random
---
Trading in this game is honestly cancer. PPL always want like 50k caps or legacies for anything remotely good even most of it has been duped.
---
What are the prizes for it?
---
Meat week is laaaaaaame!
---
I want more events similar to fasnacht.
---
There are legendary drops both for completing the event and killing Earl. You have to loot the body though.
---
No, not a bug, they can drop ultracite ammos but it’s extremely low amounts and chance
---
Finally got the damn patch installed, an HOUR after I started, but that's another matter.  I didn't see any noticeable difference from before the patch.  I had no slow downs even after installing it.  Played for about an hour and a half.  
---
Did the Colossal Problem in this time and it ran fine.  Dark as shit, but ran okay.  Sorry, not sure what it is.  But I do know it sucks.
---
Yep.  And I have a newborn and a full time job.  My only day off today so grinding is t really a thing I can do
---
Hahahaha ahhh ok. Thank you!!
---
Yes it will. Probably 10 or 15 times more damage. I use handmades, fixers, laser rifles. Everything was boosted.
---
I am but I'm worried how much budget it may take to display
---
The servers just suck and lack consistency.  Happens with the queen and even with lesser mobs where one server they will take too much damage from everything and the next one almost no damage.  Seems like meat week is causing more of this than usual right now.
---
I did 2 queen runs last night.  First was solo (bit still on a public server....nobody showed up) and took about 15 seconds and 60 ultracite 308 once she landed, 2 minutes for the whole event.  Second was me and 3 or 4 other people and took 20 minutes and a few thousand ammo.
---
if I'm going to be honest I'm going to have to get rid of an entire section cuz I have too much power over that I want to display
---
You could easily get 15000 for the plan but that'd be one time. If you learn the plan you would get the same for a bloodied or junkies increased swing speed multiple times
---
There are 2 raider dailies. Some times its her sometimes its the other one.
---
It actually did though, people were losing legacy's and god rolls that were in their stash not their vendors
---
Under the current PTS, the ones who get dinged the most are the high-powered-single-shot builds like Rifleman.  There is literally no reason to not switch over to Commando.
---
It's kind of disappointing, really.  I held out this long because I wanted my toons to be something a little different.  Two are predominantly Rifles.  One is a Gunslinger.  And under Bethesda's new numbers, they have no place.
---
Yo: down.
---
Gimme til 5. Same time zone. Mic too.
---
Egroegy is my psn
---
I go by "Egg"
---
Right before you exit the mine there's a room with a chest containing real minor loot and some ore inside it to your right.
---
You get a notification, and it takes several minutes before it actually starts, maybe don't try to dip in late just for the rewards.
---
Yeh same here actually now you mention it, very hectic on the first go. Good fun though, second time I forgot to equip my hazmat before I left lol. Luckily got my rewards.
---
Same here.  No problems on X Box.
---
I get prime for my gauss minigun regularly, if I use my gatling laser I get random ammo.
---
I heard there was a trunk to loot after you kill him but I couldn’t find it, do you know if it’s in the main room that you fight him? It’s so dark in there it’s hard to see where earl is half the time lol. But it was such a blast, he’s quite a bit harder than the SBQ and has some serious armor
---
We sure don't. Just leave it, cast it in the fire.
---
Well, there are plenty of fixes to things players caused, yet we see bethesda get shamed for that because how dare they ruin your fun flying around with that hacked .50 cal
---
Bruh some dude had a bloodied build with a pipe revolver that did 3200 damage per shot
---
Pts lowered that to 800 which is still rediculous imo 
---
You're right tho that the issue isn't that bloodied is OP, it's that the way damage scales allows so many ways to get that op, and the devs don't know how to build challenging content for average players and also the players with those rediculous builds 
---
Which is what the daily ops are trying to be 
---
It's a big nerf but it's needed imo, the max damage possible is rediculous and this nerf is where they at least started to work on fixing that
---
What would be you prefered playing style?
---
Explosive rounds.blow up everything.
---
Ah man, guess I’m going to have to switch over soon
---
Once upon a time I was a rifleman using a bloodied handmade to conserve ammo, but I've been commando for at least 8 months with no regrets. If you like using vats at all the fixer and handmade use half as much AP cost with an auto receiver over the semi auto one and do nearly as much damage as the slower version. 
---
Also if you have a shotgun that does decent damage that you like, it may be a magic weapon that does more than the intended damage in vats due to a glitch in damage calculation. This glitch has been active for quite a while but I would consider the possibility they might fix this before spending time to spec fully into shotguns. Just an FYI.
---
To my understanding, I believe it's supposed to be about 2 days from the last time you turned in the quest. Since there's 2 different raider dailies, they typically alternate. 
---
If you still need more rep, you can stop by "Ohio River Adventures"(far west side of the map, a little north of Camden Park). Fishbones should give you a quest to kill off some mirelurks whereas another person(I forget her name) should give you rep by turning in mirelurk meat daily. 
---
Then another option is to do "Photo opportunity" from the overseer's house. Each time, choose to take pictures of Foundation, take the photos, and then go "sell" them to the raiders. It'll give you another boost in rep. Just make sure to go back to the overseer's house and finish the quest.(I don't believe it's been patched yet but before you return, server hop and you should get more rewards without having to lie or anything)
---
Good to know thank you.
---
I actually kinda liked it. It was goofy and lighthearted, but didn’t break immersion. Sometimes you need that in an otherwise really bleak game like this
---
ahhh ok. they would drop 308 like every 3 outta 5 i killed but i know i killed like 10 with the prime and didnt get any
---
cool i add ya and if ya got anyone else down they can come along too. =)
---
Yes and so does demolition expert as it has explosive effect
---
It's a joke that went on about an hour longer than it needed to.
---
There is just no point in comparison. They shoot three times as fast and only do 10 less damage per shot ñ.
---
Literally had no idea about this! Damn lol. Yeh I was using and ffr handmade at first and it broke then I switch to Explosive and it did significantly more damage, especially a crit to the face in vats.
---
I prolly will. When I add u ill take count
---
I went through 100 grenades the last time I did it.
---
The bag sent with the $200 power armor edition was advertised as canvas, but they sent out cheap nylon bags. People's heads exploded, half the sub was wishing death on bethesda. Bethesda relented and sent out canvas ones. People are still bitter almost 2 years later.
---
Nuka Rum was a small bottle of rum (like in a hotel minibar) inside a plastic, full size nuka-dark bottle. I can only assume people freaked out as per usual. (hee hee, watch how many downvotes I get!)
---
I wonder why people weren't losing their space suit helmets and bone shards? Maybe because people don't want to pay vendor price for anything that isn't valuable. Nah, that's too simple, the bug that came from shuffling around inventories specifically targeted your best gear. In fact, the bug accidentally connected to fed76 and scanned your entire stash for the most valuable items before listing only them for sale
---
I was getting tired of it for a while recently. Bloodied was getting old, then I got the new cursed harpoon gun with A Colossal Problem finally releasing on console, and I’m actually starting to enjoy the game again.
---
Yah I was wondering about them fixing that soon.  All my shotguns seem to do a great deal of damage in vats.
---
I totally agree. I lived in Florida for 11 years before moving back to Oklahoma. I must say most Floridians are rude little dickheads lol
---
It's close to the entrance and there's nothing more valuable in it that some caps and loot
---
But it's not just bloodied getting nerfed tho, so why is your post focused on it as if bloodied were the only thing affected?
---
It's a damage rework, not a nerf, it does involve a damage nerf but that's an effect of the change, not the change itself 
---
It's not as targeted as you make it sound is what I'm trying to say
---
Reloaded, t fuse first, then analyze. Worked for me in public lobby.
---
Say what?
---
Turn on pacifist mode
---
Yes. And I went to queen fights and fought to get some loot. Why? Because I wanted the loot. At the queen fight, there were no player limits: if anything I was helping, maybe just a tiny tiny tiny bit but I was. Here, they take up a slot a high level could have and drag the rest of the team down
---
Start looking into damage perks for the weapon you prefer to use, also make sure you are using the highest level weapon you can if you're not using a legendary.  After that it would be weapon mods that increase damage, scrap the same type of weapon if you don't know them all or find someone you can trust to mod them for you.
---
With the upcoming damage nerf, fire rate is going to be at a premium. Might want to switch to commando. But if not, all the Rifleman perks + max Tank Killer + sneak perks will make you a good sneak sniper.
---
I'm also on PS4 and may have some rifles (Rifleman or Commando) that could help you out.
---
They drop the rounds you use on them for me it’s fusion cells and .45
---
Lost to wives and children..lol.
---
Usually I try to snipe but the best I have is 68 damage but barely does anything
---
Done 3 runs so far and not experienced any of that on ps4. Maybe had a couple of minor lag spikes when there was a lot of adds. Can't comment on respawn issues as haven't died.
---
Why not? Just throwing bodies at him without punishment makes dying trivial because someone will always be back in time to prevent him from regenerating health.
---
Even when it is properly spec'd, it is a VATs hog compared to the equivalent fixer or handmade.  I've been trying to make the 10 mm SMG work since launch, but it is a solid fourth behind the fixer, handmade, and combat rifle.
---
Finally, my Old Man Winter power armor helmet will be more than just a 10 pound waste of space.
---
If it's all your shotguns then you might be using a piece of magic armor that makes then act that way, the magic effects is reduce damage while blocking by 15% for some bizarre reason. It is possible your shotguns are all individually magic, but I am not the expert on that area. Just enjoy them while you can and be prepared for disappointment if the magic ever gets fixed.
---
If you have healing factor get rid of it, I removed mine yesterday after months of the bug to see if what people said works and it really does.
---
300 omg that's so many.
---
Also why the hell are you using energy weapons on Earle....?
---
Well I found a sniper but it’s only a level 10 that I’m using, I’ll try to make a new one at level 30 if I have the plans
---
All Tesla shotguns have explosive effect. Demolition expert improves explosive damage.
---
I still find it odd we are crafting these pieces yet we don't know what they will be. I get the purveyor being random. Crafted items should offer more choice.
---
Are you making sure both brahmin are at full health by the end of the quest every time?
---
I feel your pain tho, took me about 3 weeks to have it drop for me
---
Meanwhile my wife got it on her second run lol
---
Its just rng
---
I had this happen where it was me and this lvl 102 along with 6 other lvl 50 and belows me and the lvl 102 wasted so much ammo
---
It actually occurred to people who had done the inventory glitch, it was pulling items from their entire inventory and reading it thru vending machines, same thing happened to the same people when the fruit punch bowls were giving people legendaries instead of whatever drinks they had in it
---
Haha just wait until next patch damage nerf, we are all going to eat shit.
---
im down deathbyvhs23 psn
---
Not allowed here but there's a market sub where you can make it happen.
---
If you're on PS4 I can craft you a fixer, that was the only weapon I used for quite a while around those levels.
---
Or you can complete the quest that gives you one
---
What platform are you on, I can make and mod basic weapons and armor if you are on PS4.
---
Been playing since beta and that's news to me. Good to know.
---
The bots never cared about customer service.  From what the RobCo employees and Army Drill Sergent said, no one cared about quality for government contracts, only rich clients.
---
Only 300? My tesla uses about that during a glitched Line in the Sand.
---
Thankfully I always carry thousands of them, so it doesn't matter.
---
I only used like 5 stims and 3k 5mm and 2 cores it’s not that hard if you have situational awareness
---
I’m on Xbox
---
Go see wren when roxy doesn’t have a mission, there’s an option to make daily missions active when you get near the person. Just walk into crater and it pops up on the screen
---
If I'm on the same server as the general you end up, my permanent camp is real close to Graham. I'm the same username there (on PC) as I am here. I'll hook you up as a quick and free fast travel if you need it. Also, watch out for the cave drop just in front of the archery target, because I locked the door back into my pad from the cavern workshop and it might slow you down getting out.
---
That's a really good tip. I went all over the map looking for some of the critters when I did these.
---
Yea I've been looking for one too, but it's pretty rare from what I can tell. Saw someone throw one away for a Reclaimed mask though so I'm not sure what's with that
---
It's on a barrel on the left as you walk in. I think you can only get it a the start/end of the event.
---
Probably, those mongrels in the third tunnel are tricky. Thanks for the help, Im leaning that I haven’t gotten the plan still. Back to the grind
---
It’s the shit falling from the ceiling that gets me. I’ve played the event bloodied power armor and only died from the damn shit falling from the sky. 2/3 times I died right at the end and couldn’t loot.
---
I found a holotape near the beginning of the mine that seemed to fufill this, you can go back to whats her name and give her it and she'll thank you for going back in to find more of what her father left behind for her.
---
It’s a tough one. Defo needs to be nerfed. He needs to be weaker and the wendigos need less of a stun and to be weaker too. I had 10 people in mine. First time we failed and the second we got it. I’m not sure what it was really but lots of bullets rather than lasers. Like 6 level 200+ pelting this guy and we almost didn’t make it.
---
Meatweek is a lame event.just like the bos one and the mole miners one.garbage.glitchy.shit rewards.
---
Hey /u/Kosan9913 (AKA _Hades)!
---
Is there any chance you could resend the discord invite? I'm entirely unfamiliar with discord, so I had no idea the invites expired. If you can't I totally understand! Thanks in advance if you can. :)
---
I only had 300 and I can't make any rn so I have to go grind watoga
---
So...there are consequences when dying.
---
Interesting.
---
I have a VFFR fixer, I didn’t even think of using it. I don’t run powerarmor either but next time
---
I’m going to use that fixer
---
I tried commando build for a bit and oh man ammo is expensive after a while haha
---
I had been saving lvls too respec a little bit &amp; try N get riflemen,as I have the other two of 3 maxed wit tank killer or w/e...
---
But now ya got me thinkin I might need to switch to commando,even though I’m sure I’ll be tearing through ammo.
---
I’m on Xbox and downloaded the update went to do the event and you still can’t fast travel to it like why is that still a problem I would’ve liked for them to fix it before release
---
Oof my bad, dunno how I missed that rule
---
Not mad at the cursed shovel I got with swing speed and reduced weight.
---
Ironically I'm also trying to grab that atm haha
---
Thank you everyone.
---
There's a quest that gives you one, can't remember the name of it right now but I'd recommend completing that one ASAP
---
I just hope its not limited to one display per camp.
---
I'm not saying they need to remove the time limit but they need to not make it a whole minute of just staring at a respawn screen
---
What others have said, it's on a barrel when you go in, mine had a quest marker on it when I walked in so I grabbed it and listened to it.  Did you still get your rewards?
---
Colossal Problem is legit
---
If you're on PC you can zoom in with the mouse wheel. The icon gets larger but the player dots stay the same size. It's the only way I've been able to fast travel to it.
---
Sent it
---
I can't even finish the event after 6 attempts. I'm beyond frustrated and annoyed. Its not worth it at this point. I get it, its supposed to be a challenge but having to wait for the 60 second respawn rate and being flooded by wendigo bullet sponges is ridiculous.
---
...and that was the point. :)
---
You can always heal the brahmin with the friendly fire perk and a shishkebab 
---
Or bashing them with a flamer 
---
That's what I had to do, and I ended up just embracing the inferno medic lifestyle lol
---
Really now? are trade discussions allowed here actually?
---
I’ll have to google it
---
Definitely wouldn’t be that much higher damage
---
Improved damage lower durability.
---
Unfortunate, maybe a fellow xbox player will see this and lend a helping hand.  Personaly I love to help out newer players, always willing to lend a hand.
---
It's ridiculous, but a rule for some reason. People get banned for mentioning the other sub's name lol.
---
Thats ridiculous. The loot isn't even worth it at this point. I'm so tired of these failed attempts its not worth the strain and wasted ammo anymore
---
I can't wait to try this.did you do it solo or with others?
---
Commando is a good option if you like playing stealth but need to deal more damage. Combat rifles,  handmade rifles, Fixers, Railways and Assault rifles can benefit from this perk if they have atumatic receivers. It's better to equip three 1 level commando perk cards than one 3 level card.
---
Also you shoul look for furious or instigating prefix legendary rifles until you have a solid build
---
I'll try to contain my girlish enthusiasm.
---
Haha my bad! Thanks for your help!
---
Wait, when you say you're not sure if you've gotten the plan or not
---
You are actually reading the plans to learn them right? Otherwise it should be in your inventory til you read them
---
Of course. When you fast travel you are essentially leaving the event.
---
Idk if it glitched for me but like 40 wendigo spawns fucked my team over at once and they are fucking horrible to try kill in swarms like that
---
Done twice, 2 wins, so... what level, what build, who were with you ? For sure, he's a bullet sponge but not so hard. SBQ was far too easy for an end game boss. I think something a little harder is good for the game... And for the ammo, that will be better with legendary perks and the ammo one. For now, yeah it's a pain in the ass, especially with ultracite ammo
---
You should try to find a Fixer. They are perfect for sniping builds. There are lvl 20,30,40,50 versions. If you can get help getting the plans or buying them from a player vendor you will be able to get legendary Fixers from the legendary vendor.
---
I'm lvl 89 and I have used a Fixer since lvl 30. I started with the basic lvl 30 you get from the initial quest. With the rifleman and stealth perks your sneak attack damage will be amazing. 
---
A few levels ago I slapped on an automatic receiver on my legendary two shot explosive Fixer and I love it even more now.
---
That annoys me. They give you like 3 minutes to get there before the event starts but 20 seconds to loot with wendigos still spawning
---
very hyped. my camp is gonna look like Tony Stark's house.
---
However if you die, you respawn outside  and do get the rewards.
---
Are you a console player by chance?
---
Yeah i probably wont do it very much
---
it’s so frustrating bc the game is already notorious for the loading time but after this damn update it’s too much to put up with
---
And stimpacks are everywere, I dont know how you do guys cause I always have 150 on me without searching
---
This event seems really easy on PC. I've only failed it once. I wonder why everyone thinks it's so difficult?
---
Are you sure you're not Talking about gauss? I think i've never seen an explosive Tesla
---
What do you mean by toon? I haven’t played the game  for a while, is that something that was added?
---
Yeah I get you. Just wait until it’s nerfed. It’s worse loot than the scorchbeast queen because atleast you get flux from her. I got a two star black diamond from my colossus...
---
At least it's three star guaranteed
---
I’ll have to look into getting it, atm I only have a hunting rifle plan but it’s far from good enough, because I don’t have a good enough gun it limits me to what missions I can do, atm I’m stuck not being able to do any as every place I go is like a level 40 creature
---
The battle is for players with OP builds. Let them have their fun.
---
What the fuck is with this subreddit, I was ranting about how it's the only fallout subreddit that doesn't allow videos or text posts the other day
---
I know there's the other filthy casuals one, but it sucks that this is the sub that most new people are gonna go to to learn about the game and see what the community is like
---
Meanwhile the restrictions on this sub seem like they literally only want text rant posts and stuff, idk what the mods are thinking on that decision
---
need to check your internet connection, it's obviously shit
---
I've seen people miss FS Prime as well. Lots of confused emotes from people standing at V9 waiting for the SBQ to spawn and she never shows up. Pretty embarrassing.
---
How did u start it I still just see a pile of rocks in the way
---
They drop the kind of ammo you use on them. Except for fusion or plasma cores and their ultracite brothers, then you get random ammo. I thought it might be bullshit but then I thought about getting the equivalent amount of cores as the other ammo drops and realized then you'd just be getting a bunch of 5% cores which would be horror.
---
I think it was patched on the PTS server a while back but it's only just hit consoles today!
---
It isn't there right now? I could have sworn i saw it earlier today
---
That was the whole point of the quest! Lol.
---
I'm talking about the respawn timer not load time
---
That’s not how “games as a service” works
---
I got a bloodied explosive a couple weeks ago and have burned my 10000 stashed 10mm rounds since them. It's the funniest gun ever
---
Whats going on with the Tesla? Heard someone ripping another player a new one about using one there. He went off over public chat during the barbecue how it caused them to fail.
---
Or what? are you going to leave the game!? 🤣
---
What's confusing is that the nuke map you get via the targeting computer is different to the normal map we're usually used to. Major landmarks are not shown (only fast travel markers), so I guess I can see why mistakes might happen.
---
We're delighted to announce that this content is now live and distributed in patch 46, released earlier today.  
---
You can't yet play this event as we've only tested it for 3 years on the PTS and still need to make some final adjustments, which we will make a pre-announcement about announcing, sometime. Enjoy the new content and thanks for being such a great community.   
---
We wouldn't be able to create the content without your feedback.
---
I agree it wasn’t meant to be a hit to any specific build, but the result was the same: optimized builds got hit way too hard. Not just bloodied. That’s the biggest issue. Players with little care to commit to a build type are able to play on the same lvl as ppl who have to take hits from chems/DR/HP, what can be crippling losses should be rewarded in other aspects, and that’s not seen. 
---
While some food builds lost 1-3% of their dmg output, bloodied lost 130% and junkies and berserker both lost 20%+. Instead of making more optimized builds so players had more options they chose the easier route and then dropped a game changing update into the PTS without even taking the time to tweak it themselves first. That’s what we’re frustrated about. What they’re damaging is a staple of every MO/MMORPG.
---
OK.  I was just wondering if there was something unique about the weapon, like a Grahm logo or something.
---
I have two legendary fixers I use. I just switched over to a automatic/commando build and it's fantastic. I have a two shot explosive Fixer that gets a huge damage boost from the demolition perk.
---
Yes, but I figured it might be like Lode Bearing. That event you can just escape by fast-travelling and it doesn't cancel your rewards.
---
No problem at all if your on Xbox and need help lmk man
---
Found it that it most likely was legacy guns. Just did a third event and although my frames were pretty bad, they weren’t nearly as bad as the first two. Every time I got near someone with a explosive gat plasma my frames tanked
---
No clue at this point lmao, but feel free to dm lol
---
I'm unable to play til closer to the weekend but I would be down to figure out a deal for that helmet 
---
My friends haven't been playing fo76 much so going on nuke runs has been more of a drag so the less of those I gotta do to get the helmet, the better lol
---
I'm glad someone else caught it. As soon as I read it, I heard it in his voice lol
---
Cause they're level 100 with an BE cal50 or handmade and they think they know the game   
---
 and they deserve to bash the new boss the first night ? (joke but meh, yeah not so a joke)
---
Done the event 6 times and always have been successful. Got a few plans and alot of Legendary weapons including cursed weapons. It's easy with a good team
---
Its just such a laggy mess man haha tesla makes it worst
---
Halleluyah
---
Just did it my first time and completed it but didnt get out in time they should change the time limit when you have to exit the mine
---
Noooo shit.. Guess that's a bonus, the chest at the end is rather shit anyway.
---
 But I did notice a copy of earls body was at the exit of the mine which I thought was a neat feature. Almost missed the screws he dropped lol
---
ohh nice! I do have FO1st, actually. Figured the extras would be a good idea considering I'm planning on doing this for at least biggest part of a year. :) Didn't realise it came with a tent though! Thank you for the heads up!
---
That's hilarious ngl
---
Seem to have the issue with wall displays aswell
---
Ah, makes sense, it's got like a 2-6 percent drop iirc, but I've been doing a lot since right now nukes are dropping all the time. But yea we can work out a deal I think
---
Xbox btw
---
Yup since I’m bloodied been using that mutation well try that out
---
Are we talking about the super mutant that you have to have cook out with ? If so, he set up camp right beside mine. If not, then a super mutant set up camp right beside mine.. i was so puzzled when I logged in.
---
Oh so when I stay I don't die and drop junk? Nice
---
The event is fun except for the fact that if you die at the very end, you're unable to loot. Only event like that and it negates the fun.
---
Yeah, I've played it a few times, I'll be stepping back until they fix this.
---
I like how all the staff robots sound bored and totally done with your shit.
---
Finally get a solid server, and do my 1st colossal problem, only for the game to crash as the mine collapses.
---
 What a fucking joke this is.
---
If you where on PC I would craft you one for free.
---
I think you should be able to complete the quest line that rewards you with the lvl 30 version without too many problems. Check the fallout wiki for more info.
---
For me, either the gane crashes or the event just doesn't load up for me
---
I switched to Commando some time back, but still carry the Instigating Lever.  That's good for most normal farming.
---
I struggled for a long time with that, too. But it gets easier. I tend to make trades on the Market for 5.56 an .45. I'm level 320 and currently have about 60k 5.56 and about 15k .45, which I don't use as much.
---
Same issue here, also on PS4. Can equip frag grenades, but every other type of grenade instantly auto unequips as soon as I try and equip them. Anyone care to proffer a solution?
---
I to guilty of AFK at drum ...RL call at anytime just glad my Toon helps complete for the ones who have no clue how the event works ...Lol Your Welcome
---
Yeah sorry.I was looking for him at the prime hunting event.
---
You have nothing to apologise for. Your response was right from day one. I'm glad at least Bethesda did enough post Wastelanders to make you happy for your purchase.
---
Dont care about budget.wanna display the cool stuff I'm hoarding!
---
Eight players, you are just unlucky I guess.
---
This, I take Lakeside Cabins for the lead. I’m level 70+ (have multiple chars). PvP doesn’t bother me. Kill me, I come back and kill you. Last 2 times however, I killed the attackers multiple times and they just kept coming back. In one instance the person destroyed my lead extractor. I’m thinking there’s a small group of griefers starting on Workshops.
---
In the end I got on mike told him congrats, I’m leaving the server. It wasn’t worth the 50 caps I’d lose when I was killed vs the 14 I’d receive due to them being wanted.
---
Yeah, it seems they were incorrectly turned into an outfit with patch 21 and Beth fixed it.
---
I found it funny the first time until it glitched and I hand to start it from scratch 3 times
---
Every hour
---
At the start of every hour.
---
There’s a few unique plans, a helmet and three cursed weapons that do bonus damage.
---
Every hour on the hour.
---
Its fantastic
---
Yep just encountered this five minutes ago. The mole miner in him was flexing. Beat him but when he died he turned into an ash pile and sank into ground again so we couldn’t loot him. Bethesda please make him won’t turn into ash pile just like the SBQ. So much ammo wasted.
---
So has it ever been confirmed that wendigos are classified as ghouls? If so, would ghoul slayers be good against Earle?
---
Thats kind of what I figured.
---
Shut down your Xbox, restart and apply the update.
---
Well I just started to go towards the place I need to go to to start that chain of quests and there’s a level 50 there
---
I just did the event for the first time with 3 other random people. Everyone else was so focused on killing Earle. I stayed in stealth, crouched far away, got my shots on Earle to ensure I got a reward, then made sure to pick off every single Wendigo spawn in sight to protect the team doing the damage to the beast. It was pretty fun.
---
Is it only for a limited time?
---
Yeahhh, I don’t have a huge problem with not killing it, but not getting the loot gets annoying. I have a two shot mini which tears through anything. But the whole dying way to quickly even when I try to play full health is just bs. Sadly we probably have another month of this if they decide to fix it.
---
I've another 3, this game is like no other I tell ya.
---
Those numbers are damn near scientific, no lie
---
&gt; especially since the daily quests never had this issue before they started the whole point system.
---
This actually isn't true. Daily challenges auto completing was a thing even when the challenges were for atoms instead of SCORE. They even claimed to have fixed that issue in the update 20 patch notes: "General: Fixed an issue that could cause Daily and Weekly Challenges to complete themselves automatically."
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/47XE9Dbh3weAd5kusOIA8p/fallout-76-update-20-patch-notes-june-30-2020
---
It's way, way to valuable to just give to someone.  Maybe if I'm in a really good mood I'd give it to a stranger, but definitely not someone that asks for it.  Get it yourself or trade for it like everyone else.
---
Apart from the 8 treasury notes, these rewards don’t sound enough to warrant the ammo for me.
---
I think you just pull up your favorites wheel and it should have a button displayed to drop it. I'm sure that will come in handy as it adds a new fast travel and it's pretty compact and easy to drop wherever
---
 you're just saving time.
---
What about ammo? As a rifleman I dont have to farm with the converter/armco.
---
Til Wednesday? But there's going to be another Meat week again not long after
---
As soon as you have 3 or more people, the fight gets way harder. Broken weapons are he only way to 3 way this fight. Use your brain and understand how levelechanics work in this game; the more, the harder.
---
If you're paying $100 a year, don't you think you should at least have the right to play the game the way you want? Compare this game to 7 days to die. Every server is a private server, because that's how the game works. The pay for server hosting and then you get to add your own mods and customize it however you want....
---
A colossus spawned down in the bog, in the pink flower/tree place, and scared the crap out of me. I didn't even know it could spawn there. I literally bumped into its legs before I realized what it was.
---
I had no hope of killing it, way too much HP for my lvl 70 unarmed self, so I just farmed all the wendigos. Went from 300 to over 800 screws before the rest of my public team finally saw my "come here" and wendigo fear emotes, showed up, and killed it. 2 gatling lasers and a gauss minigun, plus my punches, finally did it in.
---
I always feel like people are gonna use an exploit to get my gear by default cost
---
80% of the time it works everytime
---
Oh ok so it ends this wednesday?
---
But what if I'm both a tank and dps?
---
Bloodied Big Guns build with emergency protocols and dodgy makes me pretty tanky.
---
I use a BE 50 cal for damage and a VE one to heal.
---
What do you think I should focus on?
---
Edit: it was an honest question 🤷‍♀️
---
Sorry, mmo gamer term, it means another character, 'toon'
---
Were any of the players using tesla rifles? Especially automatic ones?
---
Whenever I'm near a tesla being used, it causes a graphical freakout of epic proportions, black pixels spaz out over everthing and the framerate drops to single digits.
---
But dude, they can't make more "viable" builds that you expect them to because the damage was so rediculous that they literally said they couldn't make challenging content like the Daily Ops work when the max possible damage was sooo high 
---
The goal was to lower the damage gap between non optimized builds and optimized builds, they want the game to be playable both ways, while still obviously allowing the optimized players to be at an advantage 
---
And they still are!
---
Just not as much as they used to be, but I don't see why that's so much of a problem 
---
I don't see how you can look at a bloodied pipe revolver build which currently hits for 3200 damage and say that's fine when it's in another galaxy of damage than what more casual builds would be capable of 
---
Even on the pts, like you said,  the non optimized builds have stayed the same, while the optimized builds were nerfed 
---
The same build that did 3200 per shot now will do 800 damage, not including any sneak attack multipliers and perks 
---
That's still miles above what a non optimized build can do
---
Like I'm genuinely curious why you think this much damage is necessary to be possible to do or else you risk losing your enjoyment of the entire game?
---
Sorry I don't mean to sound heated, it's just a game and all, but I just don't understand the hate for the patch at all, and I say that after trying out a bloodied and junkie build for the past 2 months
---
It's not the ash piles just the Tesla.
---
I wish Beth would give us a toggle so we could use them as either an outfit or underarmor.
---
In my experience, Earle isn’t too bad.  The environmental hazards are challenging.  Instead of just standing in place and unloading, it’s important to be aware of warnings that the ceiling is about to collapse, or positioning yourself so that you run into a drill or poison pile when you get hit with fear.
---
Hype
---
Nah, keep stealth out of daily ops.
---
Don't get me wrong, I was like you at first too. I even gave some suggestions on the PTS forums for how to better include stealth in daily ops. But now that I've thought about it more, I think stealth should be kept out of daily ops.
---
It's just not the game mode for it. Think about it, the only difference it would make to the gameplay is that you'd deal more damage. You'd still sit on the same objectives, doing the same stuff, but it would be easier. Stealth would be the optimal build. At least this way people have a few build options. 
---
There's also the fact that you will sometimes be set up with noobs who will try to stealth the entire dungeon. This is a fast paced mode where you have to run to each objective as quickly as possible. Having noobs stay in stealth would be frustrating (and if they're on mic, I can guarantee you they would yell at you because they're trying to be "optimal" while you're all running off leaving them exposed).
---
Anyone who currently runs a stealth build can just change their perks. There are tons of agility perks, like marathoner and moving target, that would be incredibly useful in this mode.
---
Even if you don't like doing that. This is only a small part of the game. Stealth is not "useless" just because it can't be used in 1 mode.
---
Keep stealth out of daily ops.
---
Yup. I can give you a bloody chef hat and outfit I'd you dont have one. Keep getting those
---
OK. I'm in the UK. I'm five hours ahead. But I'll probably be on for at least five of those hours. It would be good to have someone help with the MW event. 👍
---
It's max 8 people per group.
---
Early its good to do a purified water farm. Also build your camp where there is a resource node like junk. Look up on youtube for camp location with junk and water. It will give you what you need. Lots of junk and make lots of water . Sell water at train station each day.
---
👍 Cool.
---
No fix. Points are gone for good.
---
Dumb question here, but is this the type of event where you don't drop your junk when you die?
---
Whatever's needed most at the moment, probably
---
Earle does that sometimes. He has a "My people need me" moment and flies off into the ceiling and disappears.
---
Yes, but if the camp is that close to the drums, fast travelling in / joining event takes forever, if the game doesn't just get completely hung up.
---
Dont hold onto weapons and gear thinking you'll use it later, well dont do this until lvl50. 
---
Also just enjoy the game, appreciate the world
---
Good news is we get another week next month
---
OK so everything is now fixed and again thanks for the advice
---
Lmfao.
---
Yo Grahm pass me the aux cable
---
Some events are also breaking stealth, something to do with mole rats I believe. 
---
Regardless, the problem i have with it is in combination with legendary cards, where we need to scrap as many cards as possible to get the most out of legendary ones. leaving little to no room for build flexibility or experimentation.
---
Perks on SS armor? I'm not following.  
---
I should have went after the Raider underarmor and am working on it. The problem for the level 3 and 4 ones are the plans are random drops not from a Vendor. I'm fairly patient with getting the flux and got the one for the SS fairly quickly.  
---
My priority is ammo for this character who uses mostly .45 but .308 for sniper rifle, and shotgun shells for low level mobs.  
---
Are the rolls at least applicable? I HATE getting Ghoul Slayers or Bloodied.  
---
You can't sell or trade SS armor right?
---
Here's Sophia's build. I'll get the others when I have more time.
---

---
Top of the hour
---
You should check out the no russian youd like that.
---
I don't group that often and have hit that event as a solo most of the time.
---
Creeping up to 3k hours and I have 1 of those things. Nobody is going to give one away.
---
i dont want to be fucking with 20lb weapons unless Im using it.. 
---
Im not trying to make a fortune in caps.. Im trying to shoot shit in the face to death.. lol
---
&gt;I guess they couldn't be bothered to make internal walls like everyone really wanted.
---
You couldn't have possibly expected that to come in the weeks since the issue first occurred...
---
You hit X to ignore.
---
Stop talking literally no one likes it when you do
---
That's Gauss not Tesla, my friend
---
It will only pop up at the purveyor if you select to buy melee weapons.
---
Explore every inch of the map.  Discover it all, but if you run into tougher enemy territory,  come back later
---
Just saying...FT takes forever anyway. IMO anyway
---
I can see that from what you got, but I did get lucky and a pretty nice junkies railway rifle from it
---
That’s really true honestly, people sell them on eBay and game flip for a sizable amount, and people buy it. If I were to sell everything in my account, I’d probably make at least 200 dollars
---
Try adjusting your strategy.  Bump up your health a bit, use defensive perks or swap in extra in favor of QOL, save up scorchbeast meats or Nuka cola for quicker healing, use buffs, etc, etc.
---
Every time this task pops up I go to all the sites you go to to do the "Suface to air" events. Theres always one sitting in one of those many locations. Quick, easy and usually run into a legendary or two of some kind.
---
As a Rifleman then the weapon plans would be the best investment for my gold is what I'm getting from all this.
---
Y’all complained everything was so easy and made fun of Bethesda for it.
---
Do you have to do a certain amount of damage to earl to get loot from him or just tag him.
---
Are there details anywhere for these large monster / boss scalings for events? I had a really easy 2 person the first time I did this event with another bloodied stealth commando. Thought it was pretty fishy that one of the recent times it was just me + level 31, 50 and 54 and it seemed like I was doing way less to his health bar.
---
Yeah right it was fun and all but I guarantee that your game froze bout 5 times wendigos all over the place bodies flying people dying 😂😂😂
---
So you're not guaranteed them all being 3 start? That's a HUGE time sink.
---
Thank you for the heads up.  Going to stockpile mutant slayers and troubleshooters armor now.  Should have already gotten the troubleshooters set with how much I like doing Encryptid anyhow.
---
I just tried it and like four people showed up. That thing is a fucking sponge.
---
In the first place they should've give players an ability to sink all them freaking items to the ground, not just foundations. As well as improving walls/roofs/floors/etc clipping is a main priority, too!
---
Yes I’m reading them haha, I’ve been playing since right after launch
---
I am the same way, but it's so funny how the difference in wanting to be charitable in games varies alot based on whether You/Me know that they want the want the item lol
---
Aight ima head out, just pointing out funny social habits
---
Already learned this the hard way a couple of times haha
---
I have to wait and get more ammo before I can try it again. I and five other people went in and got trashed. I waisted all my ammo for my Prime Blooded Gauss Minigun on him. Every time we would die he would regenerate. I could see once because he is Legendary but 4 times is a little much. Did not expect that.
---
Huh, neat, I thought it was a Hawaiian version of the refrain from  
---
I Didn't Know The Gun Was Loaded
---
https://youtu.be/9vSfqR3Hyxc?t=19
---
That's not good. Considering everything you have to go through to even get to the point of buying the plans that's a big time sink. I don't think being end-game that is a good mechanic and BGS knows it.
---
It depends on what ammo you're using
---
Okay just the way you said that made me unsure lmao 
---
That would have been an epic bruh moment
---
Dunno why so downvotee sometimes not jumping that high is good.
---
No doubt. I was like "Holy hell, this is so real life....."
---
You have done us all a great service. You are the hero we don’t deserve.
---
Yea that’s what I’ve been doing I only hold onto level 10 leather armor im currently using and a couple of different weapons.
---
It doesn't matter as much as you'd think, so long as you pick a weapon whose ammo is generously produced by the ArmCo (like 5.56 or .38).
---
Course, if the current PTS changes happen, this goes out the window, but everyone's ammo usage will go up, period.
---
It was awesome. Best event since Encryptid.
---
Awesome advice!  Thanks for sharing.
---
The Harpoon Gun and Shovel are both Executioners, not Bloodied.
---
Charity is what happens when someone nice decides to give someone something, not when someone begs for it.
---
You're awesome my dude! It worked!
---
Yeah, unfortunately for me, I cant really trade around for armor since I'm too used to Secret service, i cant give up the rads man, plus the ammount is starting to rival some Power Armor. And especially as a bloodied build, I dont wanna grind around for other types, nor do I even have the space to store it all because of the scrip limits.
---
I'm really getting close to a breaking point with this game, too many things are simply working against each other
---
I just tried to start the chain of missions to get it and ran into a level 50
---
I caught the reference. It was a Mulan quote. And for the record, the "cow" was actually a horse.
---
This is a great suggestion I appreciate it! I’ll be moving my camp to one of these locations for sure I’ve been looking for a better place anyways!
---
I think its just one hit like everything else, still bad etiquette to afk after get one or two shots in.
---
Xbox? Yeah I haven't been able to play recently.
---
[Monk goes slide... awesome!](https://lionelwendling.bandcamp.com/album/electro-monk)
---
Yes terrible and and the collossus event is unplayable i have like 5 fps while fighting earle
---
I havent even tried.. 
---
I figured if my computer can barely handle One Violent Night.. it would be like reading a comic book of the game if I went in there.. lol
---
Dude....I do not want to see naked mole miners, ever!
---
I'm on PC. My bad. It's a common drop but I can give you discord link if you are interested with Xbox players
---
They need to fix its REEEEcoil
---
No. You don't.
---
Can’t wait for shelters this winter. A near limitless budget is what they have been saying.
---
Yeah 10lbs in your pocket including all the pieces and a fusion core, ... nah ignore them, we all do .. I also mute anyone who doesn't have their mic turned off. Reap the benefits ..
---
My tank build with a Vampire Gauss Mini is loving this event.
---
Scrap Scrap and more Scrap if You can pick it up scrap it 😁 or use it. Daily vendor cap limit is 1400 follow the train tracks vendor bot at every station. Water purifiers are very usefull. Good luck and have fun.
---
Sounds like you have a colossal problem then
---
Probably would’ve just gave up on life at that point lmfao, no coming back from that 😂
---
Pc Players... But yeah different story on console i mean it's still buggy on pc and the frame rate on console is horrible
---
8 Treasury notes and I get flux as a reward.
---
Best event since Encryptid
---
I never said my way was the only way to go play or the way you *had* to play. It’s curious that you decided that based on... absolutely no evidence. 
---
And a rose by any other name still smells as sweet. So what does it matter what they’re called, if the actions restored are the same?  Quibbling over the meaning of the word is literally what ‘arguing semantics’ means. 
---
Have a good day. And go play however the hell you want. It’s all optional anyways. Not required.
---
Reason im asking was thinking I could clean up the mobs easily with quad double barrel as long as I know im going to be able to loot early after they be team player.
---
I have 10 plans, what platform?
---
We shouldn't have to play on private servers just because y'all have inferior builds.
---
PS4
---
I think you'd have to wait for an event timer or notification to start it. I came to it in a nuked zone and someone dropped another while I was there and it still was closed. Haven't been in the PTS or looked up anything about it so no clue. I have the option to talk to the girl about how she'd think to get in but other then an exact spot to drop the nuke I have no idea.
---
[Charisma 4] I thought you Enclave guys would jump at the opportunity to get rid of them.
---
According to the lore, mole miners are trapped in their deteriorating suits and cannot remove them. That gets really dark if you think about it too long.
---
Still, I wouldn’t mind learning more about how they live when they aren’t standing around waiting for my Fixer to deliver a .45 round to their heads. So you get my upvote!
---
You should see me trying to keep my .50 cal mg fed :(
---
Get rid? Yes.
---
See nudes? Hell no!
---
Yeah whatever needed at that moment. the instances i was part of i was training wendigos around Harold like it was CoD
---
Sounds like a you problem and not a them problem. I have ran 12 now aside from 6 other people farming wendigos only and using 2000-4000 rounds in my gauss mini no problems at all.   
---
Take that back the first 3 had 4 of us killing it in less than 3 minutes but we all had broken guns. So 9...9 times 3/4 of the people are useless.
---
I'm a melee bloodied build, when I head in i drop some fury, fire up my minigun and focus Earl until the small wendigos spawn, then run laps keeping them off all the heavy gunners doing the real damage and trying not to die down there - that place makes me feel fragile like nowhere else lol
---
To be honest, these days you can remaster NV yourself better than any company could with how far modding has come.
---
I figured! Hope you found him.
---
what does DMV means?
---
I was Using a bloodied stealth commando build, it says that in the post lol, it was my first run of it and I ran it with randoms with no mics lol
---
you can only enter when the event is up. that happens like the SBQ where it only triggers when nuke is active
---
Yes, I attempted it today, failed but it’s out.
---
Mine used to disconnect me when doing that first meat week.
---
Ran 12 so far on xbox it's been fun aside from the ammo I use up since no one else seems to want to attack the colossus.  Still haven't gotten the cursed pickaxe, got everything else though now. What I really like is meat week t-notes along with the wendigos I have over 300 now and I started meat week with 0.
---
Just stay down there and kill the wendigos that keep spawning in, once the timer expires it drops you out the front with full event rewards 👍
---
I have yet to do the event
---
2 people I did the first time by accident and was honestly easier than 3+ people. If you have someone to be aggro, the stealth builds do a good bit of damage. Maybe 7 min of fighting?
---
It's ok I'll just make a post to ask people if they have any for xbox
---
I’m pretty sure it does on the newest Xbox app, you’ll have to download it though because I don’t think it new one rolls out automatically
---
I had expected it to just remain gone until they brought their proper fix at some indefinite point in the future.
---
I had heard it was reversed in the PTS but there was no expectation of that stuff going live for months at best. Why I thought it was note worthy to mention it was back at all since no one else was mentioning it.
---
With their simply reverting it back though, it suggests to me that the proper fix is so far on the back burner now as to not even be worth anticipating anymore. 
---
Which is disappointing when it's the camp builders keeping the game funded at this point. Especially when every other new camp item is broken or fundamentally off to such a degree as to not make them worth purchasing.
---
Halo CE and Halo 3
---
Lol bro you really zeroed in on the NSFW stuff. I never mentioned it.
---
I'm just saying, IF mods are introduced, those mods have absolutely no influence outside of the private servers that those mods are running on so what does it matter?
---
My introduction to mods was in fallout 4 on PS4. Sony highly restricted what could be done with the mods, so no explicit content, no external assets, no custom scripts, none of that. 
---
All of the modding was done within the existing constraints of the games ruleset. Just changing values and playing around with the tools BGS uses themselves.
---
IF there will be mods, it's just gonna be similar to that anyway.
---
Anytime *member*
---
*welcome to the enclave. Family... For life.
---
I give it a 50/50 chance dupers figure out some way to abuse it.
---
Run it with me then.  I’ll show u all the bad luck I have lol
---
I'm not surprised, me and a random rifleman did it earlier successfully. I'm basically the same as you, except I dont use the vamp weapons. I should start though, I was blowing through stims like crazy. Actually gets boring after awhile, it's just shoot, heal, shoot for 20 minutes. Good job though, I can see it getting dicey at times doing it alone. So many wendigos.....
---
It's just uncommon
---
Weirdly and I only noticed today, but i did drop my junk and had to recollect. Thats new or I didn't notice before. Public events like this shouldn't cause you to drop junk though
---
I saw the cursed pickaxe in a vendor for 3000 caps, so someone got one tonight
---
I absolutely do not understand why there is a cap limit and why there is a limit to the number of caps that a vendor has.
---
are you kidding me Urgh!...  
---
Well thanks for your answer anyway
---
How is it a me problem if the game as like 5 frame rates per second during the Fight? It's not DPS maybe you misread. I used a lot of different Weapons JE Gat Plasma, J25 Gauss mini etc. Dps isn't the problem i could probably kill it alone if it wouldn't be so laggy
---
Here in Virginia Beach, you have to stand in line to take a number. And it is preceded by a letter, they then call them in seemingly random order. I once needed a copy of my title I had Q4, they were on Q2. I sat there for four hours. I found this event to be rather quick compared to real life.
---
Thanks a bunch so just to clarify I should sell my junk to the vendors?
---
My bad, I'm always confussing those guys
---
How is the cursed harpoon? I got a cursed pickaxe with weight reduction and power attack increase. Booping people is always fun.
---
yes, but travelling to a Primal Hunt with a camp will take in excess of 5 minutes.  That... is much longer than normal.
---
Welcome to the club
---
Today I managed to kill the colossus two times. The first time I was killed by some debris out of nowhere and couldn't loot earl, the second time earl decided to bury himself into the ground. Nicely done. At least you get a guaranteed 3* at the exit.
---
I really wish I could upvote and downvote your comment as I agree with half and disagree with the other.
---
5 FPS is actually working as intended for fallout 76
---
Last one was yesterday for Double SCORE dailies
---
If you’re on PS4, I’d be happy to give you any duplicate items I have.
---
Us it normal to get the rug constantly? Done it 3 times rug everytime
---
Well it was 8 people then lol
---
Yeah for real, I just did a quick eBay search for "Bloodied Gauss Minigun" Top result is somebody selling Bloodied/FastFireRate/90%RW for $25AUD. Now he no doubt has dozens of these duped or available to be duped and you know there's countless schlubs out there that would buy every last one. That's hundreds of dollars right there.
---
Man, I just went down the rabbit hole looking at stuff on eBay. I had no idea there was so much hacked shit getting sold for real $ right out in the open.
---
Well what Lorespade and I do is go to his camp and spend a half hour or so with me picking a locked door and him relocking it. Time consuming? Yes. But also hilarious.
---
You're probably right 😂 Damn i should know by now
---
Here's the trick. Kill the wendigos and loot them. You'll get your ammo back nearly all. Unless you're using cores or something
---
Great, 3/3 successes, frames drop down to like 10 during some heavy gunfire but its manageable.  Running as a team of 5.
---
Seriously...?!? This event was much needed, we needed a challenge and they gave us one. The game overall is a breeze. The only time I died was on the second go, that was because I left and forgot to equip a hazmat, c'mon man. Sorry but it isn't the event its you, maybe your build needs tweaking or something, a better team even... I don't know but asking them to nerf it is ludicrous.
---
No junk is your crafting materials. Sell water, chems. Weapons/armor you dont need. Don't ever sell junk.
---
Eh I have a few copies so I haven't paid attention lol
---
This. Pretty easy to solo
---
Damn, that's bad news
---
With a good vats crit build it can be much quicker
---
I know, it’s crazy how someone could have duped 200 B2525 fixers last dup and sell them for a good amount each and make 100s, If not thousands of dollars
---
cores mostly. and I use more 2mm than they give back. I am still sitting on 10k lead and 50k steal so I am okay for a while.
---
First run was perfection. Second was glitches. Third was perfection again.
---
dont expect that for winter, at least you won t be disappointed
---
No. No its not. A junkies may have a magic effect, but that's determined by the secondary effect, not primary. If he had used a magic weapon he would have been done in five minutes.
---
It worth if you Heavy gunner build, and the Ammo is very cheap to get it only need is Steel &amp; Lead
---
Did you talk to Maggie at Foundation first?
---
Thanks comrade, and honestly same. That place is a big slice of humble pie.
---
Go watch angry turtles video on the effect and learn something.
---
Instigating, junkies, and stalkers primary legendary effect by themselves can produce the magic effect. Used to also include medics but a lot of people report that medics no longer works, including angry turtle. No need for any secondary. Can also have just one piece of armor with 15% blocking and every fast gun and shorty is magic.
---
The weapon matter less then the perks you're using.  The build that will get nerfed the most is the build that uses the most damage modifiers.
---
It is the Teslas making the FPS drop. Bethesda has somehow made it so ash piles can't be looted, so now a shitload of ash piles=craptastic FPS. Also experiencing this more in Radiation Rumble as well.
---
Does the nuke have to be on top/close proximity to the mineshaft?
---
They actually do drop prime ammo
---
Ahh okay gotcha thanks for the info!!
---
Finally got on to try the event, did the most damage, used  thousands of rounds of ammo and revived a bunch of people who didn't revive me when I was down. Then I died while Earl was at 5% health and lost out on looting him. Yeah I probably won't waste my time doing this event unless things change.
---
Finished my first attempt and had a blast! Everything the PC players said would happen did happen to me, of course. I died 8 times with the 8th being the exact second that Earl died. I went right to respawn without the option to be rezzed and was not able to get back to Earl to loot. Missed all the wendigo loot as well. Fortunately I was able to complete the event and got the plushy plan!! Can’t wait for my next run
---
They had double xp a couple weeks ago. Double daily pts this past weekend. Wouldn't expect another for awhile.
---
the mine's map icon must be in the blast radius
---
I love my black powder arsenal too much to ever change. Sucks so hard that pvp damage is capped at 110 when I can pound npcs for nearly 3k and just cycle my black powders
---
stable flux  
---
rare plans  
---
sometimes ammo (.45, .50, ultracite .50)
---
Drop a nuke on Mononga mine. Done.
---
Haha no worries! More attention in class next time :p
---
I just carry a semi auto and auto version of my handmade and swap perks depending on the situation. Rifleman is more than sufficient for super mutants and the like. Definitely not ideal for boss fights.
---
Yes I'm sure they are COMPLETELY unaware of it and would be shocked, absolutely shocked.
---
Is that new? I don’t recognize it.
---
and bad save points. i finished that some time in the late winter, imagine doing that early after release when servers crashed on the hour for funsies.
---
This has been THE longest day at work ever
---
Do you have sufficient credentials to enter this mine?
---
Not more, same actually, BUT it ignores 80% of incoming damage when the queen "only" 70%.
---
Oh shit nice, I just assumed they didn't apparently
---
I’ve run 4 events today. 3 completed. 1 just failed because I only went in with a junkie shotgun. Bloodied Heavy Guns PA is meta.
---
don't you think I've tried...  
---
I have to fuss with my gear because wearing my DPS loadout, I'm overweight by almost a 1000 weight - swapping out to my round the town loadout, I'm under 300lbs and not overweight...   
---
This is the only event where after the event, they continue to attack you and dump you in a radiation zone. Their lacking of planning this event really shines.
---
Stupid question but you have talked to the chick at foundation and read the three notes correct?
---
The weapon in general has a special skin, but the plan just allows you to build it and gives legendary drops
---
Flechette makes it needlessly powerful, and apparently mildly broken as I get more harpoons than I used
---
Ahhh. Thx. I think it’s also immune or very resistant to explosive dmg. My JE Gatling plasma is just as ineffective on earl as it is on the queen.
---
Lol I’m sorry that you’re still at work but I can guarantee that it’s a fantastic event!
---
Is it?
---
I've not heard that claim but it would be nice.
---
Kudos to whomever put that list together!
---
LMAO. Give you one? How about, NOPE. Grind for one, or trade.
---
This is an endgame boss... a level 20 with a hunting rifle and combat knife shouldnt be able to beat it
---
Yeah it's an ongoing glitch bethesda is aware of. I'd say file a ticket anyways but... It has only happened to me so far when I'm playing during the reset. If I log out before and log back in after it doesn't do it. Hope that works for you.
---
Trick for me has been to farm mats and craft as I go. Scrapper perk and guns for steel, and snatching up anything that has lead in it (rat poison, can chimes, toys, paint, weights, etc). I main with a Gatling and keep the mini in reserve for special events.
---
Very hard on cores I used 8 home made plasma cores in the final attempt, dealing 10-22 damage per shot.
---
is that what causes the pixel confetti and the CHAIN?  I haven't done ACP yet, but I did see that issue in One Violent Night and Radiation Rumble.
---
I am so very sorry, I did not realize that it was my Tesla...  But, I love my Teslas...
---
Happy to see some hype posts! This sub is usually full of complaining. Have a good one!
---
I believe it’s only on then chems u take.
---
The same on PC. Event sometimes runs at 15-30 fps. Lagout 76
---
You haven't started reputation quests I guess
---
Really that's it it's that simple I was really overthinking this lol so then what I go there and the giant monster should be there
---
Supposed to be on the hour.
---
Excuse me while I crap myself because I literally just got it after running the event again for shits and giggles.
---
Submachine gun... and a suppressor?
---
Ah damn, i hope they do give use double xp before the season end that would be super kind and extremely helpful for people who haven’t finished the run yet!
---
No. I died 10+ times and had all screws, fiberglass etc. I didn't drop junk once, even dying after Earl is defeated.
---
You Need to talk to maggie and ask who to get inside. Yes, we know irl to drop them but in game we don't. I'd say get on a team that is going doing it so you can be doing it together.
---
Glad we agree on one thing. I used to crawl in discords and try to catch the baddies, send evidence, they don't read reports is all I learned
---
no more legacy camps.
---
Once you've dropped the nuke, public event notice goes up, just like the queen. You can either just join the event, it will spawn you inside. Or, the mine will be open after the nuke. Just walk and load in.
---
Perk cards, mutations, other effects on the gun?
---
I hate the one where you have to save the little kid. I think her name was Ra Ra. Anyways she’s annoying af and the whole thing where she wants to go back for a stupid toy is ridiculous. I literally died 3 times going out of my way for a stupid toy smh.
---
You play with Lorespade? He’s a fucking legend. I’d love to play with him sometime if he’s on Xbox. I can’t remember if he’s just PC or not.
---
No I'd want it free for the million times I've ran whitesprings. 😂👍👌😜
---
I meant ask them how/why they did it? But thanks for your contribution.
---
Thank you where would I find Maggie I've been trying to find a team doing it all day yesterday and today and no luck I figured I would just go start it myself and other people would show up
---
I'm now imagining someone dying at the dude's camp and the Raider collectron looted their body. Took everything they had.
---
Do tesla users not get lagged out when using them?
---
Lol - I got a new LMG this weekend... Bloodied, vats 33.... 250 damage+glitch damage is just crazy.  
---
I kill the wendigo in 3 clips - it's a thing of beauty and the salt farm from my fellow event participants is priceless.  
---
Once I saw what it does, I now sit around for a few minutes before jumping down and wiping the floor so people get their hits in.
---
Me too almost always solo and hardly anyone joins my luck team lol
---
The wendigo enemies have a chance to drop the ammo you used to kill them.
---
We're on PC.
---
I've only played it once so far. 10 people all over level 100 go in, most see how much health the boss has, only me and 2 others were in there till the end and got caved in.
---
No. Headwear cannot be legendary
---
I've seen level 2s fresh from the vault fighting the queen in their party hat.
---
Is the event active? If its not the mine is blocked off.
---
I didn't understand the joke until I had a friend from the US explain it to me...
---
I believe you go to the garahan(?) mining headquarters, near their estate, and in there you will be given the plans for the excavator power armor.  Then, as you kill mole miners, collect black titanium from their copses.  After you reach level 25, go and craft the armor at the headquarters and register the armor with the system there.  You will receive power armor station plans as a reward.  Not too difficult really.
---
Your ass must be killing you!
---
I keed, I keed
---
Foundation across from Wards trailer.
---
Got a minigun w reduced weight for that :P
---
I cant wait :S
---
I submitted a ticket. My DA bought 2 of them not really paying attention. This is some of the shadiest practices I've seen from any business.
---
She's in foundation, in front of Ward's trailer next to the PA stations.
---
That stops fast travel?
---
I have 29 levels and some of the com cards already. Brrrrrrrr brothers...... Imma join y'all :)))))
---
What's your PSN name?
---
One is explosive does more damage but level 30 other is 10% damage when ads both bloodied no shotgun perks 
---
Bird bones and marsupial 
---
Bloody mess bout only thing that would host its damage but still it shows 200+ damage and does like twelve
---
I can't speak for minorities as I am not one, but I will say that I hope such casual forms of racism die out as more progressively-minded people begin populating the older generations. In my experience, even younger folks in small towns are more accepting than their older counterparts.
---
Yes. And its fine. Not everyone knows this about the teslas currently. They seem to be mostly okay in certain circumstances, but any event with large amount of enemy spawns seem to magnify the problem. Between the CHAIN effect, all the AI, and meat piles not despawning and other players around it seems to weigh down on the server and cause massive stutters, graphical issues, and even disconnects if it gets bad enough. Im sure Bethesda will fix it soon considering the tesla seems to be a fan favorite in both PvE and PvP.
---
I wasn't myself but I do not know if anyone else in the group was. Honestly hard to tell what anyone else was doing but I will try to keep an eye out. Kind of a shame as it seems like it would be a good weapon for the wendigo spawns.
---
I just tried on Xbox and when I used a Gatling plasma my system screeched to a halt. Using a handmade was somewhat tolerable
---
I’m in if you still need. Level 237 full bloodied. PSN: Saulty_11
---
Lmao 
---
Fallout 76 just wanted to know that it had indeed broken you, before finally giving you what you wanted
---
This is my plan. In your ex,which is better for auto: fixer or handmade? I have both so i figured lets go!
---
Where did you get that plan?  I’ve been trying to get a hold of a scout mask for a while now
---
My favorite is when I fast traveled to a player camp and spawned in before most of the camp objects. Got trapped in a collectron pod while wearing my sheepsquatch mascot getup.
---
I’m looking forward to trying tonight. I’m glad not everyone had a bad experience.
---
Yeah, that's right for everything important. As long as you've unlocked the stealth suit, you won't miss out on anything important (and even that can be bought with bullion later). The only exceptions are you get a faction specify outfit at the end (raiders is way cooler) and like I said you have a chance at a named 3* weapon if you go raider
---
Happened to me a lot yesterday.
---
I had to log off,  it was so bad.  I didn’t even try the new event.
---
I absolutely agree
---
Dumb question but are you a Bloodied build?
---
I loved it. Laughed my whole way through, it's so similar to the Australian experience of the Motor Registry
---
I have tried it twice and both times we ran out of time.   He takes ridiculous amount of damage (we are all 100+)
---
No luck for me
---
Got to make a crap ton of ammo now lol
---
It's frustrating.  All I want is some nice meat. Prime meat
---
Yeah but making double sided camp walls is not comparable to duping broken .50 cals
---
Well said. 👍
---
Players would hate that since it would give players who spend real money an advantage.
---
Also you donthave to eat spoiled food as a bloodied build just collect a few bottles of the fev goo at westtek and you're good. No disease low weight.
---
No they do, I was using a quad tesla during the beginning of the event until it actually started to cause this crazy pixalation ive never seen before. You can see it at the very beginning of the video.
---
how much damage is good damage on him? 
---
so, let’s talk numbers: how much is considered decent damage to him?
---
This is exactly why the game severely needs a proper rebalance.
---
I got it from the gold bullion vault. And oh yeah I forgot about that. Thanks.
---
10 people? Now I know your lying.
---
Kidding aside all my runs so far is fine. 10 to 15 min kills so far
---
Like legalizing Medical Cocaine!?
---
I did one event with my Junkie character, and despite it failing I made out with 309 screws so I’m gonna call that a win.
---
I have a BE90 gat plasma with the splitter it pumps out more than enough DPS 4-10 per pellet 12 pellets per 1 shot but breaks to often so  I' ve been using my magic gauss mini and my magic LMG that thing is so damn broken when it works since it has the 25% ffr on it sometimes takes a 1/4 of its health, when it works...
---
I know I shouldn't get used to magic guns but the irony is I have used them since the game came out. My old .50 could down the queen in a minute. Wish I still had that beast.
---
They were very [successful.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3qTeH-oIkPQ)
---
I saved my atoms because the suit was data mined with a decent drop rate.
---
The event only holds 8
---
When I got my license IRL it took like 10 mins of waiting tops. This quest was unimersive. Literally unplayable.
---
Shame. I’d have loved to fight him with my new PvP build lmao
---
The team is fill but you can always join the Server I’m in a silo rn so you got time
---
I feel like that would defeat so much of fallout. I could see this being a thing for events but I’d never want to implement it everywhere. All the high tier loot locations are picked clean too often already, and if the time to loot was cut down by 95%? There’d be nothing left for anyone else. Maybe it could work if everyone had there own separate loot pools but that’s a pretty major change to make.
---
Username..... doesn't really check out? Happy cake day!
---
I keep making posts about it in the PTS, I mostly get ignored.
---
Okay my apologies it was 8 then I didn't exactly head count
---
It’s a plan you buy from Regs at Vault 79
---
Try putting your hazmat on your favorite wheel, it will save your ass when you accidentally load into nuke zones. (I use the stealth suit on fav wheel, has saved me more ties than I can remember)
---
No I am not
---
I was very low health though
---
You die enough and there's a minute respawn timer.
---
Extra dailies from tomorow for a week.
---
Sounds good.
---
Just wait until you try heavy guns.
---
PC but ty =)
---
Thanks for the info I have a BE one I'll bring with my commando.
---
Using the meat spits counts as well.
---
After that fucking quest I wanted to nuke the dmv and I did many many times!
---
I totally agree
---
Some fine generalizations here
---
Try to find a magic shotgun.
---
Shit the bed, don't know why I've never thought of that, I'm embarresed to call myself endgame 😂🤣. Appreciate the tip, it will be the first thing I do when I get back on. Cheers, stay safe mate.
---
You’ll always run into people like that no matter what kind of game you play.
---
Out of all the ACP events I ran out of the 8 players at least 1-2 sits there’s doing jack.
---
That’s the point. That’s the DMV.
---
I..I don't see anything wrong with the picture they posted... Something up with their camp?
---
Ya since last update ash piles have been the killer of frame rates. I've stopped using Tesla, lasers and Gatling lasers just so I don't drop frames.
---
So far done 3 runs and finished it every time. My biggest issue with the event is that it's the first real new content in months and it's all over in 15 minutes.
---
We must have had two different events, because this event on Xbox was absolutely horrible. Not the design or anything, which it would had been fine and fun. But it was the unplayable lag, after awhile the lag was so bad he was skipping around, it was impossible to hit him, once he was dead it was impossible to loot him and you can forget about getting out of the cave.
---
That's a good idea.
---
But, you know that if you get in the SBQ event the queen had more resistance per player, or it was back some months ago. So even that small damage you did it didn’t did anything and also added a small buff to the SBQ. Pd: no offense intended.
---
One “friendly “ mole miner (the purveyor) is enough!
---
Glitched for us no time eveyone was pissed
---
The lvl100’s died once and sat at spawn till Earle was at 5% health
---
What an asshole. I know PVP is allowed I don’t engage in it but I’m like if you want to PVP go to nuclear winter
---
My experience wasn't bad, I had heard that if there were more than 8 people doing the event then a "second" event would be added, I assume me and the other dude were the second event.  And when I saw it was just 2 of us I just wanted to see how far we could get, I can actually imagine some well specced players could theoretically solo this event.  
---
Having done the 1st and 2nd event I knew to avoid the wendigos and concentrate on Earle, which was great experience for my 3rd event which we completed fairly easily.
---
Hmm ok thx for the info. There was definitely someone using a tesla
---
Fast travel to vault 76 is free and always there , no excuses. The event is right there...
---
That was never a thing
---
Have the head, still need the outfit :(
---
Ive completed it in like 10 min in a private server, im curious to try it in a public one and test the lag.. I really like it btw
---
Bloodied stealth commando here
---
Why not? I’m looking for a more in-depth explanation. Supposedly you only have to hit a fire rate of ~160, and the explosive perk doubles the fire rate.
---
Travel to the area the event is in, at the **latest** 2 minutes past the hour (every hour).  I tend to show 2 minutes or so before the hour and hop on the drums, because exactly at the hour a timer starts before the event truly begins, and you can rack up points by drumming to get at least to the first milestone.  The event only lasts a couple minutes in cases where it completes to the third level, so you need to be there right away or miss out.
---
Ah ok nice.  I JUST maxed out settler rep and am gaining on raider rep..slowly but surely
---
Certainly more immersive than previous entries in the series. I walked up and down Boston and there wasn’t a single Sox fan trying to fist fight a Super Mutant drunk.
---
For real, that dude clearly hasn't spent any time in the midwest, or the majority of the south. South can get iffy in certain parts, but the majority of the people there are so very sweet and polite.
---
People know which one that is and are selling it for very high.
---
No idea what that's from but I like that lol
---
I haven't tried this yet but I guess when you've already been shat on by the whole world for your shitty game you have nothing to lose. Why bother putting effort making the game enjoyable.
---
Alms.... Alms for the poor'! 
---
-_-
---
Yes, in fact even having them in your inventory Mark's you as a super, Bethesda knows the origin of every item and will ban anyone with any duped item.
---
I actually like primal cuts, great for XP and glowing meat lol. Treasury notes to but I have nearly 1000 now... Luckily they weigh notta.
---
Until you accidentally walk into a falling debris zone and die almost instantly.
---
Yup, just like real life. There's people who play the game straight and people who don't, people who always have to have an edge.
---
I've had both ends of the spectrum; the first time, a few days ago, we had the full 8 people there and it took us longer than any Queen fight I've ever attended. I was on the verge of giving up hope that we'd even finish. Yesterday, I joined one with only 3 other people, and one of them must've been using a God tier legacy or a straight up hacked weapon because Earle went down before I even fucking finished running over to him. I mean literally milliseconds and he was dead.
---
As a side note, that latter instance taught me that the Wendigo spawns are calculated based on Earle's health; the lower it is, the more spawn. Thanks to him dying almost instantly, I had about twenty of them spawn on top of me all at once. The last time I ran from a fight that fast is when a Scorchbeast saw me at level 5 back in 2018.
---
I have had so many people trying to kill me lately. That and some guy got into my locked house somehow and started shooting it up. I had to quit so he didn't destroy it. It's getting really old
---
I would suggest tagging him after he regens health at 50%.
---
 I've had a few instances where I didn't get anything from the queen cause I only tagged her for 1k damage before she healed, then focused on ads. That might just be a chance glitch though
---
A Furious Flamer might be what you're looking for
---
I'd be fine if it only worked in event areas
---
No it's not in at the moment mate
---
Buncha cry baby millennials thinkin they deserve everything with minimal effort
---
It just reduces chems you take . So your stimpack, radx, radaway and such is reduced by that much.
---
Its not legacies, its teslas, ash goo and meat piles, that with all the particle effects from earls puke pools and the dropping ceiling.
---
Do you think they might have had the re-spawn bug?
---
It would be nice if it were ".. to enemies with 90% or more health".
---
I only have a 3\* Zealots plasma cannon that i've been using for the SBQ events (and some good repair kits), now i'm going to have to be looking for something good against encrytids I guess.
---
No shit. Although I melted him the second time around. Bloodied Minigun worked like a charm. Did way more damage than a Bloodeid Gatling plasma or a .50 cal.
---
The guy has an ammunition factory there, sorry for the bad pic quality.
---
Huh? I solo these all the time.  Sometimes there's a glitch where the final enemies don't spawn, but absent that glitch, completed every one.

You could always try and find an armor piece to make it a magic one.

Laughs in heavy weapons.

No they were messing around and emoting in the respawn area

For console, plug your controller into the console and put a rubber band around the right thumb stick so it's being pushed down.

I just wanna get the Plushie &amp; that Mask,&amp; other then that...not that interested.
---
Much rather bang out Meat week until that’s gone,&amp; then maybe I’ll make a f@#kton of ammo &amp; give her a go.
---
Thinkin I’m gonna respec from riflemen to commando as well first,as I’ve recently been told it’s waaaAay better.
---
I wonder if it's just public servers...I usually run the events throughout the hour on my private and solo them just fine, then I hop to public servers for the cookout.
---
Came here to inform this.

I lived in ash heap and when 16 tons came on. Goddamn daaaaaaaark

It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, one of the best shows on TV haha. It’s basically dark humor on steroids, the main characters do the craziest bullshit and act like it’s completely normal. Definitely worth a watch if you haven’t seen it
---
I thought that same thing like no one likes going and they must've thought "you know what lets put that in"
---
AFAIK, the only weapons that need learnt to drop are the Fixer, Tenderiser, Bear Arms, Bow, and the various Bullion weapons. I'd include the Recon Rifle, but I don't think it can be Legendary.
---
To be fair I soloed it with a 1 star junkies laser gat in 12 minutes with a far from optimized build, only 2 of the heavy perks and no dmg consumables...I have a hard time seeing this fail with 8 players unless either everyone sucks dmg wise or most are farming
---
I usually crowd control the Wendigo spawns with my magic J/E Pump Shotgun, but there is a self conscious part of me that worries other players think I'm just hogging all of the screws. I only end up looting about a 3rd of all the kills, I just want to keep the heavy gunners safe so they can focus on Earle. I hop in with my Final Word between the waves of spawns.
---
I have a FFFR as well as my explosive, but you can’t get the fire rate high enough, correct?
---
Handmade ammo is easier to make, so I'd go that one
---
I moved my camp to a new location the week before, and suddenly theres a war drum in the middle of my camp and im being assualted by Fog Crawlers. Funniest shit I've ever seen.

Mobs drop 130 ult 5mm ammo which is insane. Gatling gun has basically have inf ammo here.
---
I managed to kill him in 15 to 20 mins with some players with the Gatling gun.
---
10 mins with my ultracite plasma Gatling gun and no it’s not legacy.
---
If a group of 8 players were actively shooting and are bloodied its a fast kill but that’s pretty rare to come by since I had lots of afk and players with full hp dying every second.
---
I can see this event being impossible for casual players.
---
It is not. Meat Week ends in two or so days, though we have a chance at a second week of it next month. Beyond that, we won't see it again for a year.
---
Might try booting in safe mode and rebuilding the database.  Shouldn't effect your screenshots and might help.
---
I wish your dog has a good and fast recovery :)
---
I dont know how to run it but id be down to do it if i could also offload a ton of my stash? *pleads in stash space*
---
I have one, doesnt work.
---
Mine usually registers a crit on the shot after what should have been a crit shot.
---
Ie; shooting in vats, crit bar fills, hit the button to crit, fire and do normal damage on the first shot after hitting the crit button and the crit bar depletes. Fire again for actual crit damage.
---
I notice it mostly at SBQ where im in VATS for a long time.
---
But there is a vats bug currently too where it will just eat your damage, normal shot or crit. I always watch for a hp bar drop after a shot, to know if im actually hitting at 95%, before I accidently drop a crit for 0 dmg.
---
You in the server?
---
Happens all the time when visiting family in my mother’s home country, only difference is that it’s a fairly urban area.
---
That's pretty funny
---
Yes the piles seem to cause alot of lag, but legacy gatling plasmas cause huge fps drops that are so bad it breaks the game sound. Laser rifles do it too, but not nearly as bad.
---
Did it only one time a few days ago with 3 random players. Used at most 7 diluted stims and died 3 times running it at 20 percent health since letting myself die is cheap and had no real consequence.  Did waste a bit of ammo, but expected that going in.
---
Situational awareness and non potato reflexes seem to go a long way apparently.
---
Have to agree, I've done the event twice competing it both times, but I saw low levels getting their assets kicked... It's and endgame event that engamers needed, noobs and lower levels have no place fucking with Earle. Pretty sure he hit one so hard he knocked him into another server. 😂Jokes aside though it is endgame, you need to be specced, you need to stay alive and do damage, lower levels can't do this. Unless there an alt and have specific weapons but these guys weren't. Saw a level 28 on my second run, didn't bother reviving him, no point. Harsh as it sounds he went down as soon as he got back up, so everyone gave up on him.
---
That’s fine I guess
---
Plus if you are using the armour piece then that's been patched out on the PTS already, so don't rely on it
---
Ppl been doing it forever. Who cares anymore. If they didn’t ban duper’s for duping weapons that they sell for real money. Then they ain’t going to get rid of ppl that make more ammo. I think you’re good
---
We’re going to find an other server to do more you can join us again
---
As has bash damage trigger
---
I wanted that as a varient when the junkyard armor came out
---
Ohh my wife's a fan but I never gave it a shot, if I see it on Netflix I'll check it out lol
---
It's a real problem for guns with spin-up.
---
dont' mind by nuking.. I just hate the same silo over and over and over and over and over and over... I wouldn't mind paying 10k per use for a button in my base, just to save me the tedious boring silo runs. Maybe use an old Sat Phone from pre war.  Obviously, they shouldn't give everyone a button, just to the end gamers that have killed the queen 100+ times.. something.. I dunno.. I think maybe I need a break. There isn't any other new content (meat weak is fun for about 2 hours, then I never want to do it again.  The new colossus could be cool, if they didn't force me to waste 20+ minutes just to trigger the doorway in to the event.    Not having fun in the game the way I used to.
---
What kind of build do you have that you need thousands of rounds?  I've not gone through more than 500 in a single event.  If your people struggled.. well.. they're really running with a poor build or terrible gear or something.
---
There has been a group working on a New Vegas mod for years but most of these giant projects crumble at some point. Not to mention it will only be available on pc if it did ever get finished.
---
Haha, for the longest time I had no idea either. Apparently you can fav wheel power armor pieces to switch out on the fly, too. Cheers
---
A couple hours later, I decided to turn my xbox on and give it another chance. Right away someone dropped a nuke and I showed up for the event. Like before, it started well enough. I started to get frustrated because I ran out of the rest of all my ammo and Earle hadn’t even mutated yet. Soon I began encountering even worse technical problems than before. It started when areas and objects began turning into huge pixelated static, which then turned into the majority of my screen filling with huge pixelated static. The movement and frame rate got so choppy and laggy that it grew more and more unplayable. Of course, we failed the event. I had to fast travel out of the mine because the screen was so glitched out I couldn’t tell what was going on.
---
I don't bother with these. The only reward is prime meat, which translates into scrip, but I'm always at max scrip with nothing to spend it on.
---
Honestly, I forgot about the settler power armor skin, though it does look like it’s more for building
---
Do you also have a recommended level for me? I might need to level up beforehand
---
I don't understand why they can't get such simple balance right. Automatic rifles have almost the same damage as a hardened receiver rifle, except the damage output is insanely higher. On the other hand, an automatic combat shotgun gets its already pathetic damage thrown down the gutter, for a pathetic fire rate increase. Literally 10%. It doesn't feel any different from just using the shotgun semi-auto, except that your shots barely tickle anything
---
I'd have to double-check, but I was able to melt a level 85 Sentry Annihilator in about 5 seconds when I was doing the one possum badge. That was without any perk bonuses.
---
As long as you are in the Event, yes.
---
So if you go around collecting Screws, and get killed by the ceiling, you'll still have those Screws on you.
---
That's also good to know, 2 things to do tomorrow then haha. Cheers 🍻👍
---
It’s a recommended 50+
---
I don’t understand why didn’t Bethesda “lock” these events until you at least completed the main storyline. It only makes sense chronologically and obviously lower levels aren’t going to help all that much. Maybe just don’t make them available on the map for below level 50 or even 100 at the very least.
---
Happens sometimes, all weekend.  It appears that the last enemies are not spawning.  Sucks, but hasn't happen to me in private games.
---
I think "RIP AND TEAR " from Doom would be good as well

It’s only on Hulu :(

I have a BE gat. And it has no affect on my performance.

Alright seems like ima be doing missions and events for xp tomorrow then. Wanna schedule the run for say 27th? Gt wirabletulip373 probably best if you pick the time for it
---
That wendigo is a heap of trouble
---
Use your camera, if you look around with your camera, it should show up in the top right corner of the screen. Then walk towards it until you find it. See Innosurvivalist's page on Youtube, she has a video on that and other tips. Which is here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpTAo0rwyM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpTAo0rwyM)
---
Bloodied builds upset at dying too much?
---
Haha I’m dumb. estlej26 I should be on in another hour or so
---
Why do you think we play video games all day? To escape from it
---
What level are you? What weapons do you use? What perks?
---
Totally would be if I had any budget or stash space.
---
So I don’t ever wanna judge someone when I see there level. Because maybe it’s someone alt and they’re stacked to the rim with weapons. But I’ve completed this event three times. First time was me and 3 of my team mates. We had no problem only couldn’t escape the mine without dying but still got rewards. Second time was on a private server. 8 of us, again easy. Last time there was everyone in power armor and normally I don’t use it as I’m specced to do damage as stealth commando with my bloodied fixer. But I wanted to try something different. There was some high levels like me as I am 300 but there was some level 60 and 80. Well that event went to the last minute. When 6 minutes was left I got out of power armor and did massive damage. I don’t know if everyone decided to do it but I don’t know if it was the weapons the low level had or if there was a health bug with earl. I did get my cursed weapon from that event tho
---
Now fix is so we can visit Smiley again,  ALWAYS SOMETHING WITH THIS GAME..... what a joke
---
I'm not a fan of you being a fan of the schutzstaffel.
---
I’ve had no issues over three runs, but it’s all been 100+ level folks outside of an occasional 60 something, so we’ve had the folks to do it. Focus on the spawns, I’m pretty sure they are not unlimited.
---
Does t matter to me.  Bloodied builds are almost a must tho it seems
---
Yeah i was starting to like the Brotherhood Fatigues as an Outfit. I'm going to assume the Steel Dawn Fatigues will be an Outfit, that'd look pretty snazzy to be completely honest.
---
What platform?
---
I use a heavy gun so you pretty much need pa.  Excavator because the flavor of power armor doesn't matter but the extra carry weight does.
---
Do I have to nuke it myself in order to participate? Because I've been in a server all day but got no event notification for it. I'm too weak to do the silo myself solo.
---
If we can wall hack the silo, which is a "secure" government building. It never crossed your mind someone can wall hack your camp? Or look thru a window and enter the workbench animation from the outside?
---
..........or just make sure to have someone with magic weapons there, really i have had the weirdest luck with that, both getting people using it and are nice enough to let people actually do enough damage to loot it.
---
Oh that would be awesome! I have no one to play with lol
---
Awesome news, 👍when did they do the update for colossal problem. I thought we console players where not getting it yet? Mind you I am not complaining. 
---
And to the aragent ass wipe from last week that said we console players should get to play it. The last laugh 😆 is on you bud, to bad we didn't have cross play because I would wipe 😉 your face in it 💩 Lmao! 
---
Because console players matter too. Just saying 😌 
---
Thank you for sharing this, I am going to give 🙏 it a shot soon 😊 
---
I wish you and everyone all the best!  👊👊👊👊
---
I just figured nobody would be a prick tbh. Guess I was wrong
---
It's the only reason I have PA paint tbh, unless they add some kind of legendary PA variants or at least ways of adding weight reduction perks on to them, I'll never use them for anything. But I'll probably have to tear down part of my farm to make room for the displays
---
This exactly. They call it "clearing the cache" on PS4. Similar to PC tools but without the interface. More detailed explanation:
---
Shut system all the way down
---
Have a controller plugged in via USB
---
Hold power button until you hear second beep, roughly 5-10 seconds
---
Go down to "Rebuild Database" option
---
Follow prompts
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
Alright ill go look up how to make a bloodied build then and get it scraped together
---
I never said it was easy, there were times I struggled, not all of us are bloodied, tanks, or stealth masters, considering how many attempts this was with different teams the frustration is real, and the rewards don't equal the amount of effort placed into it.
---
I was actually just about to post something similar. I’m not down for wasting extra ammo to carry the sub level 50 players.
---
The issue is limiting the number of players allowed while not having a minimum character level. Low level players should not be there.
---
I personally think it’s a challenging event, but not too bad if you stay away from the rocks and control the wendigo spawns. Are you low or high health?
---
Please don't even attempt this high level event if you aren't 50+, you won't do anything and will just die.
---
This happened to me on my first attempt, I died just before Earle did, and it spawned me back at the blocked mine entrance, still got the reward for completing the event, even though I didn't get to loot Earle or the end chest.
---
I accidentally did this in radiation rumble, I have no fucking clue how it's possible for a bug like to exist in the game. The whole entrance was a massive lagfest that looked like my monitor was dying, except it was fully rendered in the game world
---

---
I'm on my second account, not really geared, but can put some dps out... its lvl 60...   
---
The event started... 4 people total, me at 60, two level 15's and a level 200 something...  
---
10 minutes later, I'm out of ammo for my big guns and it hasn't even hit 50% to regenerate.... I left...  
---
I even logged in my main account that can 3 clip the wendigo to help... nope can't join mid fight... brilliant bethesda...
---
i just hit 50 a couple days ago, but whenever i see the sbq event it seems to end as soon as it starts.
---
Not a bad idea that. Gonna try it now. Thanks very much.
---
It's annoying but hilarious. I can't help but laugh while doing it.
---
They really need to fix this exploit, feels like it's been ages.
---
I just got done with one. Went in while on a team of level 200+ players. Got inside and the only people in there weren’t on my team and were between levels 14 and 20. My team was nowhere in sight. So of course we failed.
---
Credit where it’s due, the low levels had heart but didn’t stand a chance. I even like seeing low levels at Scorched Earth because it’s  easy for them gain xp (and they make good fodder) and for the most part they’re helping out the best they can. But for Colossal Problem... 
---
This event has issues to say the least. Capping the instance to 8 players is a serious problem. Not going in the instance with the team you’re on irritates me a bit. The respawn timer is a tougher enemy than the colossus. 60 seconds is a really long time to find out you can’t respawn without dashboarding and knowing you’re not going to be able to get back into the instance. 
---
Thankfully I haven’t experienced any crashes due to the event. Several due to the meat week events. But no colossus crashes. So that’s a plus. It’s a tough event. It’s fun when it’s working. Which so far I’ve done 7 but only managed to successfully complete 1. Failed the second time around because 10 people showed up to the event and I got into the instance with just one other person. We got really close to winning but ran out of time due to the respawn timer being so long. The other five times have been respawn bugs forcing me to dashboard.
---
*Gatling Gun has joined the conversation*
---
Console sure, an entire nuclear silo would be required.
---
I am level 176 I wouldn’t say I’m a fully bloodied build but I can be (I have all unyielding and have bloodied weapons on my quick wheel) I use a combination of final word (anti armor 50) and switch to anti armor Gatling plasma or two shot Gatling laser. For the wendigo spawns I use my explosive pump action shotgun. I have max level gear and even put the perks that increase heavy gun damage before enter the battle.
---
Department of Motor Vehicle
---
Sent you my PSN.
---
i just started playing a few weeks ago and get really annoyed "defending" workshops since you have to hunt down the enemies... is that a new issue?
---
it would be nice but not possible - level 2's at the SQB fight all the time... easy 'achievement' to get so not a good measure of a players ability...
---
I think the regular dr is just so high it essentially negates explosive damage.
---
It’s a floor decoration.
---
Not how that works
---
I wanna 100% this game but that means I gotta get alt all the way up to vault raid and side with raiders. I just can’t do it lol. I could’ve had it done like 4 months ago but I think I’ll wait lol congrats on that tho. That’s some dedication
---
I’m usually the median level at level 176. I see some level 60s or level 300s in the event and we still aren’t able to do it unfortunately I have yet to be in a full event the most I’ve had was 6 total
---
explosive tesla are legacy. I got a lvl 40 one drop a while ago.
---
Having a bunch of wendigos stun you over and over again while your trying to fight one is ridiculous, I didn't say make it easy, I said nerf the EVENT a LITTLE. Lower the stunning aspect of the wendigo spawns some so you can AT LEAST, Land one hit.  
---
A lot of variables of this event just need TWEAKED some. Not a lot.  
---
If my specs aren't good then every other player I've done this event with is just as bad, out of the six attempts all fail, that's a bit of an eyebrow-raiser, it's not just me.
---
Does explosive ignore armor or something?
---
A cool idea would be some little goblin friend thing that follows you around and loots things that you kill, I always love some personal npcs
---
Just to clarify 
---
not the rug plan I have that and found that.
---
Do you mean the hesd plan is found in the floor Dec tab?
---
F.  Its a toggle option in the display section of the settings menu.  Near the bottom, scroll down.
---
I did that a few weeks back. Made a brand new character and did a melee build.
---
Wasn't too bad to be fair but getting to level 20 felt like such a grind (need level 20 to start Wastelanders).
---
If you have the taxidermy gorillas it's mixed in with them for some reason.
---
Someone plays Diablo haha
---
Yeah, maybe I've just had *exceptional* luck, but all the times I've fought him with all manner of teammates, it's never been that difficult. I'm wearing T-65 and using a Two-Shot Ultracite Gatling Laser. When I shoot Earle in the face(s), which is pretty easy on account of his size, his health bar goes down at a pretty reasonable rate.
---
feel like parting with one? 😎
---
That happens to me a lot for no particular reason I can understand.
---
Thanks, mine is Cypherbro
---
Well, it was very fucking realistic. It just made me think of the real DMV and I got pissed just thinking about it.
---
It's not a Head on a wall, it's three heads on pikes. It's in Floor Decor.
---
I’ve actually never played it hahahh seems like a fun mechanic tho
---
I wonder if it is people waiting to see if other people will put the ammo into it, then deciding eff it, grab the spawn drops and bail
---
I've had the outfit like 3 times now, just been selling it for 8k
---
Vet players know all too well
---
That’s good news! Thanks for sharing
---
Lmao the wall on the left looks like it was taken straight out of the og doom
---
I'm not just talking about the Collusus, I'm talking about the event as a whole, the spawns stun you so much you can't even land a single hit half the time and there is so many it's ridiculous, as I said to others on here when I say Nerf, that doesn't mean the whole thing, I said a little so that people aren't scrambling to get away from over stunning spawns and the colossus having such high armour that we can't make the timer and lose the event. Losing all that effort, ammo, stimpacks, etc.  
---
Just because Stimpacks are everywhere doesn't mean it's frustrating to lose a lot of them without any reward for the effort.
---
Ngl after hearing about it on here, I was expecting it to be harder. Friend and I duo'd it on a private server since we couldn't find a single silo that hadn't been recently used and it didn't take as much resources as we thought it would. Bloodied minigun PA build + medic/vanguard shotgunner. If anything the biggest casualty was my nuka cola stash that I was spamming with cola nut on my way out the mine Enforcer was our best friend so we could cripple the spawns and finish them off easy. 
---
It's likely that the spawns and Earle's health scales dependent on how many people are doing the event tho. If it's the max 8 then I expect it to be chaos.
---
Oh okay that’s weird but thanks
---
Bud you’d be able to afford a home if you didn’t eat so much damn avocado toast!
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, HE DID IT!!!
---
1 cap. They're so ubiquitous now that they have no value beyond a scam sell to a newb
---
I think that there should be a minimum level requirement. One person made the argument somewhere along the lines that "low level players can do a decent amount of damage too" or something like that. Where I find the issue with this argument is that not many can. Those who do typically are using exploits or are running highly optomized builds. So the chance at a player under level 50 is on par with someone over 100 isn't all too likely(at least in a pve sense). 
---
Personally, for an event like wendigo, I was thinking a minimum requirement of at least 60-70 or allow the person who launched the nuke to have at least some amount of control on who enters(not total like they can kick whoever but maybe a priority or such? or maybe a waiting room vote? There's always difficulties and issues with different ideas of course, so just throwing some out there). 
---
Main reasons that I think there should be at least some requirement though is that like said, with the event having a max of 8 players, most players will usually want to maximize their chance of success and minimize resource usage and time. Having 1 or 2 low levels can easily impact the outcome if they can't pull their own weight. 
---
As for a level requirement, 60-70 minimum feels like a decent minimum range since players cap out Special and can use max level weapons. The reason for the 10+ levels or so over is simply for players to at least gain perks to optimize their builds since not everyone gets all the perk cardss they want from the card packs.
---
So what song?
---
it's a pretty old term, i've heard it used since at least ~2008 WoW. 
---
apparently much older: https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/77215
---
Kind of a stupid thing to fix considering it literally doesn't work as an underarmor. All the armor floats on top of it.
---
I thought this was r/outside and got real confused for a bit.
---
Line in the sand, a colossal problem,radiation rumble all suffer when someone uses a Tesla. It breaks the game.
---
Those 20 kills and revives were probably the worst achievements across the 4 games hahaha
---
I had the same thing happen to me in a Nuclear winter match. I’m assuming it happened because of the update.
---
100% this. My main was a rifleman build but since making my alt a bloodied sneak commando with a bloodied handmade I've never gone back. Every time I log in I CAMP hop to buy 5.56mm ammo and currently have over 30,000 bullets (+ bandolier perk!). I've since not hopped on any of my alts at all.
---
Ooo okay cool, there is a "Treasure Goblin" you can get and I believe every 10 common items they pick up, there is a chance a legendary item drops from him. Pretty cool mechanic for endgame players who don't pick up low end items.
---
If that’s the case just farm springs for 20 minutes and then fail the event. You get tons of xp plu 300+ springs which is better than most of the loot; they get nothing.
---
That's why I stopped.
---
Weird, on xbox its terrible. Once that thing starts firing about 6 or 7 seconds in it drops fps like crazy. I can take a video if need be.
---
I’d love to find a group to do this with on Xbox.
---
This is exactly why optimized builds are so frustrated. People keep seeing a single inflated base damage and assume we’re all running at that much power all the time. And before I get deeper, I’m not saying no nerf. But what many are trying to explain is that a good game is more than just dps and that’s all people have against our builds. Dps is one factor in what should be and is dozens of different things. So many people are shutting us down in conversation because they’re refusing to even believe that optimized builds have major weaknesses, and from there it just leads to everyone being ok with the current combat to people thinking an 130% dmg cut right off the bat is reasonable for balancing. 
---
as far as the number you’re listing goes, that is a combination of a lot of perks, many not being tied to bloodied. And many of them are extremely temporary. Food, chems, perks like revenant, and are unsustainable or weren’t meant to be. When you see “3K DAMAGE,” that is over a period of seconds or minutes, and once again bloodied is only one piece of that. Even with 40 str and all foods at 5% go I do about 2k with an unarmed weapon(which are suppose to do way more because of the generally lower dps). When you’re saying “bring that 3,200 down to 800 you’re really dropping our damage to 2-400 or less and at that point sacrificing 95% of your hp just doesn’t make sense. 
---
As far as the damage gap, while it could have been reduced for bloodieds there has to be a strong damage gap. This game wants to make all enemies scale to you and all players fight at equal footing despite their lvls so why would I sacrifice all the easy QoL perks unless I can ensure I’m going to run circles around the guy who permanently equips contractor or green thumb. The point of any MMO is for you to always scale and improve. The idea that a weapon that is nearly impossible to obtain could be matched by a mutant’s prefix just doesn’t make sense. 
---
As for things like daily ops, that isn’t how it works. Look at bloodieds running colossal problem. If they aren’t stealth they die within seconds rn. Having one stat that’s ungodly high doesn’t make the build any better in a well-designed game. Daily ops is doing the exact same with different mutations and basically disabling sneaking. The point of these game modes isn’t to just normalize everything, it’s giving specific players the ability to shine. 
---
Once again, I’m not against a nerf. I’m against the lack of attention Bethesda put to a major damage revamp and how many players are completely for it because their build isn’t the one being affected. We’re rewarding Bethesda lack of effort by cheering on other player’s builds being torn apart and calling it fair by repeating a single stat when there are dozens of other factors that go into a capable build.
---
*Btw I do appreciate you taking the time to ask my perspective. I don’t mind heated, as long as it’s not blind arguing*
---
Okay, thank you!
---
Shit that’s an even better idea! Port him directly over!
---
Gift horse, no look in mouth. Thats the blessing from the harpoon fairy. I have a 3* harpoon I've been rocking for months and have never needed ammo cause it always comes back in the loot. Shhh.... don't let them hear you or they'll take it away.
---
Someone told me they fixed this issue entirely with today's patch. Hmm.
---
Wow I had no idea that the instance could cap at only eight people, that’s definitely not enough especially if they’re going to be low level. They need to definitely fix that, though I could see where there could be large performance issues with this seeing as it’s already incredibly laggy in there, at the very least they should make sure that you go in with your team.
---
From my understanding, once a certain amount of damage is done to Earl, he'll spawn adds.  So, just do a bit of damage, then clear adds.  Rinse and repeat.
---
the legendary machine reset is 20 hrs too I believe.
---
Yeah just can’t bring myself to do it yet. So I got mad props for you my friend. One day I will do it just to have a completely different build. Right now all my characters I use just to hold guns. I recently rebought fallout 4 but digital this time. I just really wanna go back and play that again. That’s the game that changed it for me. I bought it on release but never played any before that one. It came with fallout 3. I played both and beat both. But then I was reading stuff about how long fallout 4 was. I said man I must of missed a bunch. The dlcs where just coming out. I went back and played prob 800 hours in that game. And then went back and did fallout 3 and new Vegas. I love fallout game’s but that is def a grind to 100% all of those amazing games. Good job, 😁
---
Thanks for assuming "Millennials" are cry-babies, as stated above, "A little bit" not Nerf the whole damn thing, I didn't say make it easy, just manageable, some of us are still getting the hang of this game and wanted to discuss or at least advice on making the event easier.
---
But thanks for your input, insulting people is SO MUCH more productive than offering advice on making the game easier for some who are STILL LEARNING. I suppose this community is more about insulting people rather than helping.
---
Yep thats the stuff right there. Thats exactly what my game was doing.
---
Not saying you, but a vocal amount on reddit did.
---
to be fair, I soloed it with a 3 star bloodied lmg in 3 clips with a fully optimized build....  
---
the only challenge is getting a steady stream of the clip into the thing to trigger the glitch dmg from 33% vats, soooo much wobble,screen distort and gun spread... Think if I actually landed a perfect unload, I could do it in one clip but that's not likely to ever happen...  
---
The best 100% hp attack I have is down to about 15% before regenerate which is why I think I could in a perfect storm 1 clip it.  
---
Was rather surprised this weekend when I found this beauty on a player vendor for 12k... insta-bought it. [https://i.imgur.com/znfZ4NM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/znfZ4NM.jpg) and I've not regretted that one bit.
---
Oh they may have didn’t realize there was a patch I’ll delete the post in that case
---
You really think they’re going to look all the way down here? It’s Bethesda. They more than likely won’t.
---
My world fell apart when i found that setting
---
Exclusive to the event and only available on pre-rolled legendaries.
---
When you first enter the mine, on your left, there will be a closed door that you can't open that has a sign saying 'Supplies' above it. When you escape, just before you exit the mine, the door will be open, and you can enter the room. It has a chest, some ammo containers, and a bunch of other loot like a military ammo bag and bulk duct tape. Nothing too mindblowing, but a nice stash nonetheless.
---
If you need broken weapons to do it with 3 then that just says you're useless.  It's a very easy fight.  I don't even use food and such and most of my perks are weight reducers.  Dude, go play Barbie Pony Adventure or something.
---
What does that mean, “pre-rolled legendaries?”
---
This was a day or two after the update. I was rejoicing that they finally fixed the damage bug with teslas and flamers after almost two years, and then I find out it's arguably worse, because instead of making you useless it makes everybody around you useless
---
I pretty much ran the same setup and probably only used 4k rounds and 10 stimpacks as long as you keep hitting you can tank the spawns.
---
Agreed. Played many times with multiple legacy gps including myself. One person with a Tesla and down we go. Goo piles no problems. Ash and meat piles galore and down we go.
---
It wasn't so bad but I do have some feedback.
---
1/ death zones generally don't suck in games if you can work the mechanic but there is a bit too much of the "make you flee to certain death" to be fun
---
2/ no looting is kind of a pain
---
3/ earle is dead .. at least to berry mentats
---
4/ second run I couldn't find his body to loot
---
5/ on that, far too much effort was found ensuring the event after he dies is annoying ... once it's done let it be done. Project paradise is a good model here. I don't care about the junk but the exit is more annoying than the boss fight.
---
They're exclusive the to the event. You can get a shovel, pick axe and harpoon gun. They do more damage but break faster and always have the same legendary effects. Personally the only use they have for me is light weight 3 star legendaries to stock up on for turning into scrip.
---
FFS. These things don't just build themselves or appear out of thin air. You or someone you were on a private team with built it. I'm sure you'll claim it was your "friend" and they built it without telling you. That's usually how the story goes anyway.
---
I'm actually slightly surprised more people don't know about it.  Does no one read patch notes anymore?  This one was a few patches ago.
---
I dunno, kina miss the quiet empty world. Felt more desolate, more "apocalypty"... I know that's not a word, but you get my point.
---
You're on reddit where 90% of the posts are that 2 minutes of legendary run a day is too hard of a grind.  These people are truly pathetic.
---
I never expect anything in life - just look forward to the possibilities.
---
Lol. Who said my build is inferior? I rock a Bloodied FFR Guass Minigun. I am just not a complete jerk who kills things before everyone gets  chance to attack
---
I didn't say it wasn't fun, just frustrating on the number of attempts with zero rewards from all the ammo, chems used to do this event.
---
The spawns stun ya way too many times considering the amount of spawns there are, you can barely get a hit in, the colossus armour is so high up, time runs out and we just got passed the first mutation and it's health refills.
---
Something I should have written to avoid a lot of hate comments from a few is not make it easy just manageable
---
I've died twice now after boss got beat. They need too do a insta add kill or something
---
I played New Vegas around 8 years ago on my brother's PS, decided I should try Fallout 3 and did a crazy amount of hours into it. Then did New Vegas. Then 4 came out and did easily 1000 hours. Went back and 100% 3, NV and 4 and then 76 came out. Took a year break and then came back about a month and a bit ago after Wastelanders and got back into it massively.
---
I agree they take up spots for higher levels maybe with one wasteland it will be fixed they’ll have a lower level instance of the event and a higher level I say lowest level should be 75
---
Oh no I wasn't trying to be a dick about it. It's just I was going to let some kid use my private server as a workaround but then he messaged and told me nevermind it was fixed after the update.
---
The wendigo colossus in my event spent most of its time in the ceiling
---
I read them but i wasnt here a few patches ago
---
I feel like low-health melee is the worst possible build for this boss. Tried it once, never again.
---
You get feared all the time, you have adds gnawing at your back and staggering you, since you're so close you have a limited FOV of the action and will often die to all the DOT effects that happen around him, and weirdly (although this may just be me) I found Earle's legs surprisingly difficult to hit with a melee weapon; the hitboxes on them seem remarkably thin/small. Oh, and Earle can 1-shot you with a single kick.
---
Tried the fight as a bloodied stealth commando, and it was easy mode by comparison.
---
I haven't failed one yet, not even on the PTS with the damage nerf.
---
Thats exactly how they work! Fix all the major bugs and glitches? Fat chance! Take away my extra harpoons? Oh yeah, that we can do!
---
&gt;Bethesda said no one would use in game chat on pc. 
---
 *Looks at all the MMOs that have active text chats*
---
I’d say I’m hybrid I can be tanky or bloodied normally for boss fights I’d go bloodied for damage but I find that I die so quickly and recurring deaths makes the spawn timer increase I’ve had to wait a minute to respawn after dying so I try the tanky build and I fare a bit better but I think it’s the synergy with who else is going into the event
---
I don’t need the loot or the xp I just want something to do because Bethesda thinks deep pocketed mods for ss is content
---
better reward when the event is over anyway. guaranteed 3\* lead pipe gives more scrip than the 1\*. The cursed weapons give scrip too. And every now and then get good 3\*'s when the event is over.
---
PSN is Legionnaire 2099
---
Ah, yeah I always forget some people haven't been around as long as I have.  All good, I'm always willing to help where I can.
---
It makes sense since they are suposed to be charging you for banging that drum. Also from a bethesda standpoint, since they are actively trying to make less players do stealth. Thats why the only daily ops mutator that is guaranteed to be on is the one that auto detects you.
---
I think you can upload the screenshots to the cloud saves on PS+ before you delete/reinstall.
---
Don’t know what level you are but depending which one you go to you have to have big enough weapons and armor protection. These events are kick ass for getting treasury notes and participating in cook offs really pay off. You need to learn what you need to do to make it successful or just don’t participate
---
I got to lvl 30 then quit, playing became a chore rather than being fun
---
There is only a pickaxe, harpoon gun, and I think shovel. They were custom created and will have the same legendary effects every time they drop
---
It basically means they are not random
---
Varies by build. My team is running same build, same buffs, same gear and we're doing 350 per shot but that will be wildly different for people at different skill levels or for different builds. I think Melee should be hitting the hardest, followed by Bloodied sneak
---
I did it for the first day or two but I figured what’s the point. I just goto event for cook off. I had a couple fail because of dumb spawns or whatever. Only once did i see a 3 star legendary which was in the bog and a sting wing. So no point. I’m only after the last two mods for tenderizer. And also another tenderizer plan so I can ask for legacies like everyone else is. Lol
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
The legendary items that are cursed, (pickaxe, harpoon gun and shovel) have the same legendary perks each time you get them, they never change (though the perks for the shovel are different than the pickaxe, all shovels will be the same exact roll and so will all the pickaxes)
---
Yeah the wait times justified for people who want an overpowered glass cannon
---
Added you dude thanks 💙
---
Ammo smith tho? 180 5mm or .50 cal for like 8 lead
---
Haven’t seen that but have had to sprint to get to an outlying enemy to clear the area before time ends
---
Yes, kill the only fun stuff that overpowers the annoying stuff.
---
It's actually WORSE than going to the real DMV. And the only thing worse than that is oral surgery.
---
I'll add you later, not home right now
---
If you want to make an actual app that people want to use, why not make one that gets the actual average price for things in the game rather than doing what Fed76 does and uses a small and very biased sample. 
---
Assuming it's even at all possible, I imagine that you'd need to have some sort of mod that pulls prices each time a person visits a vendor and then have that info pushed to your website db. So it's worthwhile for the person using the mod, have it so that if some item comes out being around the average or cheaper than the average, it's coloured different or marked with an asterix or something so they know instantly this is worth getting.
---
You could always partner up with someone if you're not familiar with the modding side but at least the web side of things would be useful for all platforms, not just PC players.
---
Same mechanic going into ops.  People are coming out of it with more flamer ammo than they went in with.  Err mer gerd, bullet sponges.
---
Tell the Tesla users to fucking STOP. The graphical lag inside the instance is already bad enough, idiots spamming Teslas make it almost impossible. Have 5 completions at this point, and the ONLY bad times I've had were with the Tesla crews.
---
Could you explain then
---
Tesla’s drop the frame rate for everyone playing and makes it impossible to complete the event
---
For some reason - I have been killed repeatedly when I fast travel back to my camp.  Who knows why. Maybe it's a glitch (shocker) or maybe Bethesda hates my fishing hat. Who knows.
---
Gauss minigun tried to enter the conversation but it ran out of ammo along the way...
---
I wish they always did that. I’ve seen it a few times but not enough
---
Fasho
---
Yep. Those are the only options. Obviously the second one is the preferred alibi for when Beth starts banning.
---
Ohhh yay I am so excited to go try this out!! I didn’t even know it was possible until it got removed and was sad that I had missed my chance.
---
absolutely worth it
---
Not if you're using an lmg that shoots .308
---
I need to stock up on stimpacks lol
---
Didnt go down once doe
---
That question is answered in his post.
---
Where you in a workshop at the time
---
I got a 2 star SS chest as a reward for the meat cook, so that could explain the last bit.
---
Its a case by case basis. Worked fine for me on a PS4 pro thats over a year old.
---
I hope not
---
I did lose my junk once. The event was over (Earl was dead) and the swarming wendigos got me. Couldn't get back inside to get to the loot bag. When Ive died during the event or didn't escape in time Ive kept all my junk. To play it safe, don't die in between the time after Earl dies and before you escape the mine.
---
I’m pretty sure the one level 60 did this in the last event I played in. But we killed him with a minute left but I got killed right before and when I respawned I couldn’t loot body and I was able to actually goto the loot room. Nothing but caps and junk but then when I exited mine I was in a black screen bug. I was pissed, somehow I got the rewards which was my first cursed weapon. I don’t know if it’s because I allowed the screen to be on for about ten minutes. Maybe that allowed my team mates to get the rewards to pop. Idk but I know the queen events have people do this too. So it will always happen. This is just worse being only 8 can be in at a time
---
Yes sir. Wouldn't be surprised to see:
---
Patch update: fixed bug that allowed players to regain harpoons in loot from killed mobs.
---
Oh yeah, and wendigo teeth give acid
---
The fire rate thing is pretty bullshit. It's dependent on consistent hits on the same limb in a short enough period of time. You can do it with an automatic laser rifle if you are accurate enough. You can trigger it with a lever action rifle, but because of how it works, you won't really notice any increase. It only goes into insane damage once you stack up a large amount of consecutive hits because it's essentially an exponential damage boost. It's also much easier to do on PC where you can get higher framerates, since for whatever ungodly reason this game still uses framerate in physics calculations
---
bloodied+33% vats LMG - 3 clips and dead, if can get lucky land all shots for the vats dmg bug, I think I could see a 1 clip kill but not been lucky yet.
---
I haven't died but I think it depends in part on the build. I'm a t65 junkies tank. I don't get hurt too bad until I get a horde of spawn stun locking me. Even then, I get free, heal and backpedal with the big gun.
---
Ok thank i already have a few black titanium and level 28, just need the ammo lol
---
In my experience the nuke will kill everything initially but if you exit the server then load back into it enemies will spawn. I think I used one character to drop the nuke then I loaded back in with another (not sure if that matters or not). Hopefully someone else can verify this
---
Thank you! Came here looking for the same answer.  Couldn't find the Damn thing. Didn't even think to look in floor decor.
---
I loved the meta humor of it,  but man that fighting...
---
Quit and then reload back into your privite server to farm. Your nuke will still be there. Clear and repeat. Reload at the golf club.
---
When I die is completely out of my control 😂 but seriously, thank you for the info. All I can do is give it a shot and hope for the best
---
Almost no issues for me on Xbox one x
---
If you aren’t above level 55 don’t do the event at all because most likely you don’t have a complete build or good weapons and you will just make others suffer and you will die a lot.  I’ve had a lvl 13 join the event we still won because it was only one low level but he died a lot and hid in spawn
---
Oh ,, thought ive your alter ego could perfectly fit between the other Toony Maloony's!
---
8 fusion cores and 100 40mm grenades are enough for me to solo it...
---
Think it’s a guaranteed 3 star so in that way &gt;&gt;&gt; queen. Lotta ammo though
---
Thanks for my first ever awards
---
My lvl 60 is a fucking animal!
---
Still pretty common to find and easy to make. I tend to sell off my .308 when I'm above 500 or so rounds
---
Just did it and we failed it :( but holy shit it is screw paradise! Got 227 screws so I’m happy
---
Yeah me and my friend just got two bad events in a row to the point were my friend just left 76 to play a different game
---
I can bet what kinda build you got
---
„lorewise“ the brotherhood got the plans about 2241. „lorewise“ the enclave is dead at year 2241 because the chosen one destroyed the enclave.
---
Fallout 3 plays in 2277 so about 30 years later. So „lorewise“ the lore is destroyed with fallout 3 if you don’t ignore fallout 2. 
---
Fallout 2... the last real fallout.
---
Amen 🙏 to that! Thoughs dam Vats aren't working so hot lately.
---
 I have had this happen on many occasions, if it not Radtoads 🐸 🥚 eggs, it a squirrel 🐿 3 miles away, well my target is a bear 🐻 tearing my limbs off and eating my throat. 
---
This has also happened in various other events, other than meet week, after last patch. 🤔 not to mention the other 30 thing not working right, including perccards. 
---
But nonetheless it was fun killing stuff for 🍖 week if I wasn't getting killed or eaten my self. 
---
I wish you and everyone all the best 👍
---
Perhaps you should have written that comment differently.
---
"Considering how the community complained about how easy this game is, I think this event is a good change considering."
---
Otherwise, the comment comes off as condescending towards someone who is actually struggling with something that's the first new thing in this game for months.
---
Just missing the good grief and the platinum trophy on ps4. Can't wait to get those 8 more kills. I just don't like NW.
---
Grats my man! Hope I'm there soon myself.
---
They’ll likely do another with the One Wasteland update (September 15+). In fact I’m so sure they will I’ll bet a $25 donation to ASPCA if I’m wrong.
---
Those are idiots, kindly don't lump them in with the rest of the community. Just as vocal of a minority as the people who can't play the game without beam splitter .50 cals and nuke miniguns
---
I had a free bin that said take only what you need. The first person always needed it all though.
---
Yea I figured it out it was just over when I got there but I killed him and got the gas mask on the first go with on 5% drop rate
---
Ive had it happen a few times now but I've become OK with it because the payoff for me has been cleaning up the areas of all the loose loot thats lying around from that bug. I usually do either the savage divide one or occasionally the cranberry bog one and Ive significantly boosted my stash of adhesives, acid, springs, fibre optics etc as well as max my daily caps selling meat and weapons. When that runs out I scrap everything instead. Its been highly profitable in unintended ways for me
---
It Has nothing to do with legacy’s man it’s all the Tesla’s doing it. Should see when some Tesla cuck has his reloaded to 9999999999. Fucking worst gun in the game they should actually remove it from the game all together
---
Yeah, I though about putting a joke to the "don't die" advice in parenthesis... I should have.
---
I know it is not a good reply but honestly if you have a "magic" weapon this event is not too bad. I joined in but got sent to the second instance with one other person. I watched as his marker got smaller and smaller aaaaand gone. I dropped to the bottom of the mine entrance where the rocks move and stood under the "canopy" of sorts and just spent the next 5 minutes shredding him my solo. Earle was only able to do screams and send his spawns on me but otherwise I was protected the entire time. Try it with more people and while you will run through loads of ammo, you may not go through AS much and a win every time.
---
Not the Enclave in Appalachia...we have many heads, cut off one and two take its place.
---
If you have *just* damage perks, it's an insignificant difference. A full set of damage perks and bloody mess is 184% damage in the live game, 175% in the PTS
---
No but apparently you dont have to you just wait for event notice to pop.  On a funny note just ran my first one and had a lev 2 there lol
---
Uranium fever is fine.  I thought it was something about ghouls that caused the lag and pixel confetti.   I will be more mindful of using the Tesla at group events.  👍
---
ahh
---
I just tried it on PS4, everyone survived, we killed Earl and escaped... But the event glitched out and I never got the "Completed Popup" so no flux, treasury notes or plans.... Only the legendaries I looted from the boss, and the Cursed Harpoon Gun for escaping....
---
How did they fare?
---
I can't even find the door. The end timer is a lame way to create tension. Let us loot piles, look around, take a picture or two. Instead, you beat cheeks and if you are like me die and respawn outside.
---
Yea it was over, I figured it out though and got gas mask on my first go
---
I'm not sure this can be run solo.
---
Ive spent about 3k .50 per run :/
---
I was told you could cripple the head (which one shows up in vats is unknown to me) and he won't scream but I can not confirm.
---
Get good free aim then
---
The colossus corpse falls through the map. No prank bigger than that
---
There's not enough time either considering the fear power and the wendigo able to make you stumble and stop reloading - it's too punishing. I wasted 30 plasma cores in one event and we ran out of time just as we were about to kill it. This game finally made me rage quit, I might need to take a few days off ha ha...
---
Just completed it with my buddy. I still can’t quite gaige it, as the first time we went in with a full group of 8, but lost as there were 2 players less than 50 and 3 players who either disconnected or just rage quit. The second time, we went in with only 4, he and I being upper 300s and the other 2 players 250~ and 450~. We thought it wouldn’t be enough, but we came through successfully, even with the 250~ guy again disconnected or just leaving. 
---
He and I are fairly “safe” players (non-meta; AAE weapons + full health), but with perseverence we got him with just 3 players - 2 minutes left. Disappointed though, as Earle fell through the ground, I got a leather arm, and a cursed shovel all for 8000 5.56. Still, we enjoyed it quite a lot. I’m sure in time, someone will “crack the code” and have this event running as quick as the queen.
---
I really hope we see more raids like this in the future, just with better and guaranteed rewards. (I was really hoping to get that rug or plushie :/ )
---
Level means little after 50. My bloodied Unyielding Unarmed was 54 and able to destroy all bosses and kill everyone at PvP. 
---
All people should be allowed. Rookies gotta learn and experienced players need to be able to lead. What's the point of being 300 if you aren't going to be able to make it count?
---
I've missed a few because of the fast travel issue. It's pretty annoying having to go back into the map to attempt to fast travel 5, 6, sometimes 7 times
---
That's probably why I didn't get any event rewards... I was trying to escape the radiation....
---
Are the original reallife ones not blind (or almost) ? Buth they can smell you from miles away, or they Just have good hearing... 1 of those 2 ive not Both! 
---
Actually make sence, you can test it out yourself.
---
Poke Both of your eyes out and you Will 'see' your hearing wil then improved by a lot!! 😶
---
Please post a video of this 😂😂😂.
---
That's what I call a nuclear family!
---
Yeah and with so many people have alt accounts and magic guns they store...level doesn’t mean 💩...I’ve seen people below 50 take out the SBQ in minutes.
---
Has anyone actually gotten a Brahmin Grill plan? Pretty sure that's not dropping for this event.
---
Or they are the 3 level 20s that I had in my lobby with 10mm pistols.
---
As an honest, hard working proprietor an Appalachian Munitions business, this really bores my barrels. This tomfoolery is spoiling the ammunition market and I've got a right mind to call the gunsmiths union on these darned scab factories.
---
If you see one if these unlicensed contraptions on your or your neighbors property, the only honorable thing to do is to destroy it. I reckon you'd best do so 'fore I finds it, as I'm fixin' to spec into wrecking ball on this balderdash.
---
F me in the B then, I guess
---
At only level 16 i would need triple quad xp to save my ass
---
Me either tbh but Atleast this post was helpful
---
If you're too weak for the silo you're too weak for earl! He's harder than the SBQ, and only 8 people allowed per instance.
---
Don’t even try and compare that to the post. 15-30 FPS is completely playable, they shouldn’t do shit for you PC players whenever us on console got the event a whole week later and it was STILL a buggy laggy mess
---
Money? Not really
---
Completed the legendary run about 4 days ago but today was the first day all the tasks auto completed. Even though I am done I was gutted. I am sorry if I ever seemed heartless to those experiencing it multiple times and still working for it.
---
I have to agree, but this is not those players fault, the fact that BGS Austin did not put a level requirement on it means that every player is going to naturally want to try it out. You can’t fault them for not knowing any better.
---
I never thought to do this but I LOVE this song it's so fucking chill! Thank you!
---
Why not? How the duck do you know what they do and do not have. I have a friend that could solo the queen with the weapons he stores on his level 15 alt account. Level doesn’t mean 💩. If levels are such a problem for you, go to a private server yourself or with a friend and so it yourself
---
In my experience, it's the opposite. Ignore the adds and everyone just focus on the boss. 
---
Unless you're not wearing PA or top-end gear, the wendigos are just an annoyance and you should really only be dying to danger zones if you're not paying attention to where you're at.
---
If you and your randoms are confident in your damage, you can just farm the Wendigos.
---
^(~~also trying to apply trinity role logic here? lol~~)
---
Same thing happened to me got the game played it until I was lvl 20 left cave back with wastelanders played until lvl 60-80 and just got bored I’m lvl 271 now it’s still not fun but I have nothing else to play the new events kind of fun but the entire game just needs update 22 extremely bad or else it might die off for me
---
Nice find :)
---
I guess my point was that it doesn't even take an optimal build much less magic to solo so lowbie leeches aren't the problem.
---
If you're there for completion and everyone farms adds too long that would be the issue imo
---
If your character is just LVL 22, you've got plenty of time to change it. You will stop getting perk points to put into your SPECIAL stats at LVL 50, so you've got a good way to shape your build to how you want it and still keep all of the stuff you've acquired. After LVL 50, you still get perk cards, and you can shift those points around to mold your build into something else completely if you want.

Mahalo!
---
You can survive the event and escape and still get nothing, shits really a glitchy mess!
---
My cowboy took his western revolver and I two-shot all minions, and hit Earl for 70-250. 
---
Guy is a sponge, but I could practically solo the spawns while the rest focused on him. 3 tries, 3 victories, 2 plans. So far, so good.
---
You won’t understand til you play other online game with multiplayer(eso) it work out just fine
---
Shut up dude
---
Crafting let's you snipe the weapon instead of rolling the random 3 star. Sadly the star rating is also random but the possiblity of getting a 3 star good roll is vastly better then buying the 100 scrip random weapon box.
---
I went in with basic t-51b power armor and an anti armor gatling plasma and did fine? I healed myself and revived the other 5 people sometimes, but I was fine?
---
I mean, unless your a bloodied build, and you don't tunnel the boss, its...not that bad?
---
I just wanna add; please let low levels at least get a hit in on primal cuts. I'm tired of levels 100+ obliterating everything in sight before I can even do anything
---
It's defo seriously fun. I had my first, and so far, only experience tonight and I was lucky enough not to die. Out of the 8 of us the other 7 all had PA and heavy weapons to go, and the only serious damage I could seem to acquire was from Earle himself chasing me down when I got to close and ended up aggroing him. The Wendigo spawns can hurt pretty hard surprisingly when they slap you. 
---
I'm probably lucky cus about 3-4 weeks before the event I found some 700 stimpacks and 100+ supers with some radaway just left in a parachute bag on the whitesprings floor, and me having the chemist backpack decided to vaccuum them up because I know I can't trust myself to play the game in a way that won't get me killed or close too.
---
They smell you
---
Doing this for ps4, and waiting for 40 sec death timer haha
---
Also be prepared that it's still hella buggy and you might get no rewards even if you complete the whole thing!
---
Legedaries like that all glow briefly when they first spawn, but lots of times no one is even around to see it. It would be nice if they glow just stayed on them.
---
Oh, thank you I was not aware
---
You just join it, like Scorched Earth.
---
They drop fuel too, don't seem to drop cores though.
---
Happened to me with meat week, they parked the event literally 10 meters from my door step and prime beasts started fucking my camp up
---
No. But, every time I log in, I have to disable and reenable Class Freak which affects my carry capacity. Could it be that?
---
Many of those players are unable to do enough damage to loot it though
---
Yeah I'm still rerolling secret service armor to try for better secondaries. Turns out I was really lucky rolling my original set because rerolling has been a real bitch. I've probably rolled the left leg more times than I rolled the entire original set tbh. Rough
---
Oh of course not, I don’t blame them really. Just annoying it even happens in the first place.
---
They didn’t stop using them. They use the lag to not get hit and well the Tesla just auto aims so it’s more fucked than ever
---
First two fights where easy with in ten minutes. The first fight he was up towards the ceiling and not walking on ground I was afraid it would disappear like pc players said but we finished him with only team of 4. Second fight on private server and was 8 of also easy. Third fight was 8 but I tried power armor even tho I’m bloodied. That fight sucked I don’t know why, but almost ran out of time. I got out of power armor with six minutes left and we had a sliver of his health left and I get frenzied into a drill when I respawn they killed him and I couldn’t loot body. First two times I died after looting him this time I could at least check out chest in last room. Nothing but caps and junk. I get to part where you go outside I get black loading screen bug. I was mad, as this was the hardest fight and for what. So I waited ten minutes then closed game down on Xbox got back on and actually had the two rewards. I got cursed harpoon that time and all the flux and caps. Don’t know how I got lucky but I did. First two events I got Crap off of earl and the 3 star where crap. This last time I got cursed harpoon and a 40% and +1 agility sledgehammer. Best thing from first two was colossus rug and then meat pile
---
This feels like a punishment
---
Sorry big man, I'll just go to the market place and ask for a bloodied explosive laser weapon and be on your level. My money is you're using bloodied with unyielding and such and firing from a distance. Go back to your private server, you giant man baby. Maybe your 2 frienda can helo you find a spare rib cage in the wasteland and add it to your character since you like sucking yourself off so much to prepare for the bloodied changes.
---
Let's say someone has a bloodied faster fire Tesla and is built around it. This person can cause a huge amount of damage, fast, and keep spawns under control. 
---
Are you going to gatekeep the thing for them? And I am speaking as a guy who has all characters and builds covered.
---
My bloodied 2525 fixer seemed to do max 105 damage on Earl, even though it easily broke 600 damage on the SBQ!
---
It was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
---
I absolutely loved staying behind and holding off the Wendigo Spawn for the other guys while they escaped.
---
It can do that on it's own
---
Was at work unfortunately
---
That's the Stalker Outfit and bandana from the Atom Shop. Hat is just Gray Knit.
---
Theyre not kidding! *Scorch beast* is right. What a smoke show.
---
Fairly positive it’s an exploit. I have seen full unyielding god roll ss armor and B/25/25 gauss shotgun in the luggage bag in whitespring station too.
---
Totally agree.
---
I can spray my LMG on different parts of an enemy and do magic damage. From what I’ve experienced, the magic damage is due to something like the game trying to catch up with the latency. Magic damage for me gets way more ridiculous in laggier servers.
---
Honestly I found it better than SQB. I hate sitting around while she flies in circles for 5 mins at a time.
---
At least Earle fights like a man!
---
That's what you get for spelling Grahm's name wrong.
---
Oh yeah I know they glow when spawned into the world... hard to see if what you’re looking at is alive or a corpse.  There’s been a couple times where I’ve seen a corpse glow like that for a few minutes at least after I killed it...not sure how long, I left. lol. That’s my bad, I thought you were looking at a corpse
---
That's honestly what makes it most fun. All that frustration
---
Guess it's time for...double corona!
---
I still have zero idea how to take part in this event. Can I just head to the mine after it's been nuked by someone else? Is it one instance per nuke drop. This company could stand to put out better information/instructions. It really unfun to have to study for 30 minutes to figure out how every gd event works.
---
When it works properly the entire event is well done.
---
I am very stupid. I read this four times and still can't follow.
---
I'll google for a video.
---
Be aware that it’s not the regular scout mask. It’s the one filled with branches and leafs. Just FYI if you didn’t know and were looking for the regular ones. Those drop at enclave events and have no plans (I’m pretty sure at least)
---
You lucky bastard
---
Ran it 3 times on same world on xbox.  1st time was just fine as the thing was killed in just a few minutes so all was well. Last 2 were horrible as the people couldn't get it killed within say 8 minutes so after that the game started lagging and by end of it was at like 5 fps and input lag of 1-2+ seconds it was almost unplayable.  Hope they fix the lag, seems to be tied to how long the boss stays alive and how many windego's spawn in over time.  Seems like after 10 minutes its getting into unplayable territory.
---
Too true
---
Add me I’m looking for someone to do it with I’ve tried it atleast 8 times all unsuccessful people aren’t playing the objective they seem to just be farming screws from the spawns
---
That's a decent build for the event.
---
You have a good build for taking the thing down but you won't play it because you might die a couple of times?  You can just not stim, waste nothing and then take some more whacks at the thing.
---
Yeah the videos can show you it. Just remember there needs to be a floor on both sides for it to work
---
Great actually only died once and got gas mask on my first one

Ah damn, mind sharing your build for the low health melee??
