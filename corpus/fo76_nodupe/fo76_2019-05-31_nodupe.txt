You can often get crap from the Leg Vendor and the different events but occasionally  you get a prize.

A few days ago from Encryptid I got a BE auto shotgun (3\*) from the imposter Sheepsquatch. Done it a few times since and only got 1 \* armor.
---
I just picked up an instigating/ss baseball bat and built an Emergency Protocol torso for when I'm strictly by myself.
---
Exactly! I sell everything dirt cheap because I really dont want things that I'm not going use taking up space in my stash.
---
I've heard the auto-pipe is bugged. I used an auto-laser pistol myself.
---
In Steve!
---
I've noticed this as well quite a bit this last week more than ever. I don't think the game is supposed to do that???
---
I have a friend doing just that but he is getting a crazy amount of 1\* scout. Like the tables are for some reason tilted toward scout or it is just because there are 2 different version urban and forest so it shows up twice as often but he is seeing it 3x more than anything else. We are kind of hoping he pulls a legendary PA piece but he is going to test it for minimum one week just to make sure.
---
True didn’t think of this
---
Ive seen some outrageous plan prices pop up but i sell all plans for 25 caps
---
I usually do maybe 1/4 the item listed value if not cheaper.
---
He looks more like a Dave! Dave the deathclaw!

When's late?
---
How much $$$
---
What about a setting to chose between show them or cover them with something
---
Sometime around 1045-11pm est. About 3 hours from now.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's not how it works. Do you have any proof to back your claims?
---
Okay kid.
---
I thaught I was just useless at the game
---
Those people suck. You know what doesn't suck? My shop! Fair prices, only 30% chance of death! (Mole rat infestation)
---
How do you guys handle the player shops? Do you use them? Are there unwritten rules about them? Are they just obvious traps?
---
Dunno, worked for me last week tenderizing with a dragon and finishing with an auto shotgun which checked both auto and shotgun.
---
I might still be up, LordJesusChrst, shoot me a message if I'm not on we can figure something out
---
I started collecting plans and recipes at day 1.  I continue to run the queen, and every treasure map I can find.  I also run all the events I can regularly.  
---
The method to success..  farm till you can buy one serum plan.  Make that one, and sell it till you can afford another.  Rinse and repeat.  I make around 3-10k caps a day and regularly spend as much near every time I login.  
---
It’s all about recycling returns.  I have all the serums and all the power armor plans now.  I don’t have all of the X-01 plans yet but continue to pick up a few everyday.  
---
I also wholly support finding a group to play with daily.  Sharing and team play help as much as anything else.
---
Nearly every event in the game that relies on waves of enemies is a crapshoot, hugely inconstant with the timing and amount of enemies.
---
&gt; but I have no idea how to run a marathon
---
Just a guess, but one foot in front of the other... lol

I feel like you're purposely missing the point yet again. None of this denies that most businesses do not close down during PEAK HOURS, which was the point I'm very obviously making. You do deny that EU peak time is worldwide gaming peak time, but as I've already mentioned earlier this is based on the steam charts.
---
https://store.steampowered.com/stats/
---
Now if you owned your own worldwide business and you would decide to close down during peak hours as Bethesda does, good for you I guess. I was just pointing out that most businesses do not operate like that.
---
That’s exactly how it works. Ill find you proof. Its on xboxs website. What is your proof that its not that way?
---
Yes it is.
---
That's why i spice it a little bit up... Only salt makes not a great meal.
---
If you're on PC and have the materials I can build one for you. :)
---
I’m having issues mounting my spotlights where I want them. They end up getting mounted in a different area from where I selected, or end up disappearing, on like one of them, ended up mounting it self to my foundation under ground. I can see the wire lead to it, and just a piece of it, and that’s it. Also, not working at all.
---
Still less than teddy bears and preserved pies.
---
I have found no consistency from the launcher. Sometimes I have to put my password in multiple times per day and sometimes not for weeks. Maybe it’s me, but probably it’s them, I guess that’s what I get for liking their ghetto rigged rpgs. I’m just happy to see that the game is alive and well still I can deal with minor inconveniences.
---
That was me. I tried the X01 an ultracite. One SBQ an both legs shot, chest is red wayyy over my carry weight so I have to walk clear back to my camp lol Now I take my excavator, an t51b in an I'm not having to do much of anything to either one. For some reason, my excavator can take a hell of a beating an its hard for me to leave it. I'm level 94 an seriously only have had to repair it 2 times since I've gotten it. My t51b is similar butttt its still not to par. Of course I only have 2 mods on the 51b.
---
Nice try, lazy shopkeeper. You don't want to use your own supplies to repair it.
---
nmprogue, I’ll be on tomorrow with my teammate if you want to join us.
---
Damn lol
---
For me I put items in there i want to sell, even if broken. Why? Some people will have good repairing perks, and can probably fix it better than me. If not, then an extra step to fix a weapon you thought was good enough to buy won't be a problem. Few adhesive, steel and screws? Not that big of a deal.
---
What about a radio tower at your camp then from your terminal you can set the songs and name
---
Maybe next time you'll think twice about becoming a European
---
It will replace it when you join a world that you can have it on. Vendor machine will keep your stuff. 
---
Best thing I’ve done is craft an extra turret and keep it stored just in case it goes poof.
---
Now your going after my cooking too!? 
---
Lol jokes
---
I sell cheap at my camp to reward people coming to my camp. I overprice on discord and reddit because honestly people on reddit or discord think a tse is worth 75k. 
---
There are people on discord right now asking for full vanguard suits for 100k (seriously). 
---
The economy is broken. And so are peoples expectations of what something is worth.
---
I’ve literally repaired a piece on my T-51 possibly twice in 170 levels. No perk durability at all.
---
If you camp can't be placed then it will remain stored until you hop worlds or build it in a new place.
---
If you hop worlds and find an empty place everything will spawn as you placed it. Moving to a new location will require you to rebuild. 
---
A work around to disappearing turrets is to build them on a foundation or floor. When they disappear you simply store the object they are sitting on and they automatically go into your camp storage allowing you to place them back on what ever you had them on before.
---
I've walked to it every time. :(
---
If the world cant put your camp down its saved in blueprints. Except for anything not on a foundation(like crops and water pump). If you decide to move when you move your camp it will have your mostly whole base ready to plop down so its not too bad unless your a legit farmer lol.
---
I dont use turrets so idk about that.
---
This is the best argument I’ve heard in this thread today sir or madam.
---
Because that all falls down when you try to think about pc or ps4
---
Should have started title with, " wouldn't it be nice..."
---
I just haven't been inside Uncanny Caverns yet and would like to check it out.
---
And ants! That's the only reason I go there but I go all the time, been thinking about putting my camp there strictly for them.
---
You on xbox?
---
It’s highly contested. Good luck.
---
The only explanation I can think of is that there are two separate teams for this.
---
A generalized Bug/Glitch Team, and an Exploit Team.
---
You can choose to stay on that world, nothing will happen to your camp as long as you don't try and place it down anywhere. Next time you load into a world, it should reappear like normal. Unless spot is taken, then ofcourse you continue to get warning until you find a world to place your camp in.
---
Not sure on your last question...
---
Please note the following post from a while back. Not sure if it's legit, so proceed at own risk. I myself have stayed in world without my camp without any issues and loaded just fine the next time.

However, they are not the most popular thing I sell. Despite having 30 Legendary Weapons and 25 legendary armors and 20 serums, my most popular item sold is Bulk Adhesive. :-(

How do u have soo much stuff!? I mean, I thought I was over encumbered :P
---
I'm working on it, I usually keep about ten minimum stocked at a time. Pretty much all I sell is food, drinks, and chems. Don't make much profit from it but I just like having full stock of every type since no one else does. I also really love Harvest Moon and games like that and I kinda just treat FO76 the same way.
---
Pic?
---
I recommend pressure plates it works beter in this scenario
---
Yeah, something like taming robots in the intelligence stat, we already have a perk in the intelligence stat to pacify robots so why not make it also to “tame” robots.
---
What platform?
---
That would allow players to store their caps before engaging in PvP. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing, but something to consider.
---
Thank you for telling me :)
---
Same

Picture or it didn't hap.. Nah, I'm kidding and I don't want to see that.

I don’t know if it’s “appropriate” but my knee jerk response would simply be “GFY”.

But that’s just me.
---
Yeah I think the hunters long coat looks pretty average but I'm looking for one also. I have found the vendor bot 3x lately but he doesn't have it in his inventory atm.
---
Oh no I don’t. I’m speaking about every person that screams for more storage or banks. learn to let go. This ain’t a hoarding game. 
---
I personally keep 400 pounds of scrap. And everything else is weapons, canned food and clothing. 
---
I rarely hit the cap.

This game isn't an mmo
---
Yeah, considering it's never been included on the booze lists for any of the brew or consume X types of alcoholic beverages quests.
---
Grenade i have, mine I need
---
It gets downvoted and called lies because the type of "raider" they describe doesn't seem to exist in game.  
---
I'm sure there's like a dozen of you that genuinely role play.  The vast majority of "raiders RPers" are using it as an excuse to be jerks.  I've never encountered a legitimate raider RPer, I've encountered plenty of jerks who destroyed my CAMP, didnt take any crops, purified water, or resources from the extractor(didnt "raid" anything).  I've lost count of the people I've had to block through xbox because I kept getting messages like "🤣🤣🤣 ur 20lvls higher than me and so scared" after I server hopped because they used a workshop on the other side of the map to force PvP.  My friend bought the game in February and was level 11 when a couple "raiders" systematically destroyed everything in gorge junkyard, though never contested it.  After waiting awhile and seeing they weren't in our server anymore I helped him repair.  The "raiders" left all of the unlocked extractors completely full, they literally didnt raid anything.  
---
If I actually encounter legit raide role players I'm sure I'll change my mind.  As it stands currently the people defending "raiders" are either completely ignorant to the behavior of most "raiders" or are straight up lying.
---
PC
---
I'd rather have the camper to use as a premade small building like the tents.
---
Let them enterna building and just wait a min. Then pop in and respawn all the mobs. Repeat rest of your session.
---
Thanks, how would you wire the pressure plate in this scenario?
---
I would but I don't know how it'd be accepted, it's all fused messed up skin like you can see
---
I’ve helped out a few others with this request. I suppose I can do it again. I’ll be online in about 20 min. GT PRL867 (same name).
---
They should know that it's part of the game. Not harrassment.  I dont get ass hurt if someone kills me while taking a workshop I own. Move on. Lol
---
I don't want to see it, but I need to see it...
---
I've only seen them once there and it was before I was looking for them. Do you know how to quickly tell when they're in there? Like does it only spawn them inside? Or is it always some of them and maybe some other types of bugs or ghouls? I've server hopped it a few times without finding any and I've been wondering if I should waste more time running through and looking for them, or if I don't see one when I first go in, should I just hop right away?
---
Yeaaaah its ass was fused together, made me think of the whole "I have no mouth and I must scream" thing
---
Nah, bulk scrapping is the perfect example of what you get when you try to make a quick fix.
---
* Mods were scrapping when crafting new items - quick fix, change that tag to manual scrap! Players will be happy.
---
* Now the Bulk Items (that used the same tag as Mods) do not scrap when crafting and must be manually scrapped - Quick fix, remove that don't scrap tag.
---
* Now bulk items auto scrap with the junk.
---
So instead of changing how an existing tag is handled (the first quick fix), they are creating a new tag for bulk items to allow scrap when crafting if not enough mats, while still protecting from Auto-scrap junk. And that takes a little longer to make sure it doesn't conflict with anything else - especially since these item libraries are imported from FO4 and may not be fully documented.
---
But yes, I agree they should have been able to fix this over the past 3 months if they were not so busy working on other things.
---
Okay. I can not join, but you can use the through the wall conduits to bring electricity into the structure from the outside to inside switch.  Run a separate line for the outside power line. Split from a pole to two separate power lines.
---
Quick question how tf did you get that much
---
I couldn't work mine with two separate switches, but I managed to get it to work if you connect the switch to a terminal inside. You have to have a cable running through a window though, or at least that's how I worked it
---
Bethesda doesn't care. They are busy at recoloring old items and putting them to Atomic Shop.
---
Just turned level 20. Yea I no that's a pretty noob move I no but I didn't no and I'm sure many other new players won't eathier so atleast they can read this and get that information  so I'm gonna safe them the embarrassment and  just gonna tell myself I took one for the team ☺

Mine was also level 50.

Ouch, was there a price increase? I swearine we're only a few hundred but I know they messed with the price/rarity of some items.
---
They stack. Nerd Rage adds 20/30/40 points to DR, which stacks on top of your armor. Doesn't do much if in PA because the DR is already high. Emergency Protocols on the other hand is 50% incoming damage reduction, which is incredibly strong.
---
They only spawn in the kitchen area of the second floor I believe. However, since this post, the new Campfire tales event is hands down the easiest way to get antmeat. Trigger it at night at Camp Adam's. When it gets to the part of the event to gather kindling, ants will pop out of the ground along with ticks and other bugs. But you'll get plenty of meat.

Tried to play fo4 3 times since it came out. Furthest i made it was to diamond city once... Its just so boring. If your going to gut out all the rpg id rather just play 76 with a more alive world!
---
Sigh. Numbers seem to be hard for you. Just because during "EU peak hours" the overall number of players worldwide rises 5 million from ALL OTHER TIMES does not mean that EU players make up the majority of the gaming playerbase worldwide. There's nearly a constant 10 million players on during the 20 other hours that do not constitute "EU peak hours". Additionally, these stats are not broken down by region. Also, this is concurrent logged in users ON STEAM. Hell, I'm logged into Steam pretty much all the time, including during "EU peak hours", so these stats don't really mean a whole lot. Especially because Bethesda =/= Steam. Steam is a social distribution platform that most users are constantly logged into, so if you want to get technical, the fact that Steam users logged in rises significantly at the same times that most of the United States wakes up and computers with Steam automatically logging them in are turned on, it deflates your argument even further.
---
I agree with this, separate armor and clothing, but more importantly please show how many of the weapons and armor for sale are legendary...
---
Hmm I'm on ps4 unfortunately.  But i can try and explain it. 
---
The switch needs to be between your power source and the garage door.
---
So if you want 2 switches, you'll need 2 separate connections going from your power source, 1 to each switch.
---
Then each switch needs a wire going from switch to the garage door.
---
4 wires total. Power &gt;Switch &gt; Garage. Repeat for the 2nd switch.
---
Most builds are pretty easy to convert to bloodied, and you can do it card by card. With a VATS sniper you should have plenty of luck for Serendipity and Starched Genes. Get your bloodied weapon and adrenal reaction serum and you're good. Chuck on Lone Wanderer if you're playing solo.
---
Dude i had some buy 300 adhesive from me today lol. Im rather curious what they use it for
---
Some Raiders only want to harvest souls.
---
Agreed.
---
If by gimmick bullshit you mean currently the strongest build when coupled with unyielding, sure. My DCG gets up to 1500 damage when you add Twisted and Talons.  
---
Power armor is just asking to get one shot with AA being so common now, but it sounds like you don't PVP anyway.
---
Not sure I saw it in a freinds camp
---
Exploits are usually an issue where code that is working correctly can be tricked into giving results you didn't want by following specific steps the programmers didn't consider when putting it together. So removing an exploit is usually just a matter of adding a rule or exemption to prevent the good, working code from interacting that way. It's like finding out a tenant's 2004 Lamborghini Gallardo that is 3 ft. 9.9in tall can exit your parking structure without paying at the gate since your gate arm is at 4ft. The arm works, the car works, and you can fix this by lowering the gate more.
---
Bugs are issues where the code is not working as it should and they don't know why, otherwise they would have fixed it before shipping. So they have to hunt through the interrelated portions of code to find where a typo was made, or a variable was re-used. Or your code may be fine, but tone of the libraries loaded with it is the wrong version, Who knows? It is broken code doing strange stuff, like if that gate arm just randomly opened or closed, so some people got out of your garage for free while others get their roof's damaged. Is it the arm? is it the payment module? Is it the sensor in the floor that tells it when a car is clear? you don't know, and have to go testing or replacing each part just hoping it isn't the controller software or maybe some other nearby business's RF transmitter that is triggering the whole thing.
---
Wow. Just wow
---
I'm still wearing the swimwear from when I did the swim test at spruce knob lake last week. I sometimes forget its on until I pop out of my power armor to use a workbench somewhere.
---
is there any point for a level 53 to try?  should I sport PA?  Would like to try it out but pretty sure will have my ass handed to me
---
No idea! Haven’t done it myself but so far, there is me (84) and another guy (125).
---
Its RNG
---
Haha with my unyielding set and high capacity backpack mod, I can carry **465 lbs**. That's nuts.
---
Maybe I'm missing something here... but how does that make them a griefer? You can't destroy camps, so how would you break into that box anyway? Maybe he couldn't shut it down and built walls to prevent sales because they are at 25k caps limit?
---
I'm guessing you're one of those that didn't get the titty enough right... Just relax take it easy if you don't like something which I think in your case is probably just life scroll past it... But one thing's for sure thumb ninjas make me laugh :-p
---
ok.  i will read up on it and if I decide Im brave enough Ill come join (with my big girl undies on). :D
---
Ha! Though with adhesive, I can kinda see why a newer player or one that isn’t willing to grind out the farming to make their own (Razorgrain, mutfruit, corn) as Adhesive is required for pretty much anything at a work bench. 
---
The ones that throw me are the occasional players that want massive quantities of totally random crap. Like a guy that wanted 2k rubber or another that wanted 500 coal. I have yet to figure out what coal is used for and I’m almost level 300.

---
So now you're arguing that Bethesda isn't doing the updates during peak time? You keep going on these weird rants, but the core points are folly every time. Earlier you seemed to argue that Steam updates are somehow easier and less critical than fo76 updates? Despite the fact that if something goes wrong thousands of games are affected? Even games that aren't Valve property? And yet these updates happen during off-hours, but because the analogy isn't pretty enough for you the argument doesn't fly?
---
And now you argue that EU peak time isn't also fo76 peak time? How about we grab the fallout 4 charts then:
---
https://steamcharts.com/app/377160
---
This just brings the update window even closer (right on top of) peak time...
---
I'll not respond any further, because at this point I'm just gonna assume you're just looking for someone to argue with.
---

We just try to remind people on here, being a raider and being a douche are not mutually inclusive.
---
Do you mean the player icons?  You need to go into the Atom Shop&gt;Icons to set them (which is unintuitive).  Scroll through as there are several that you own by default (as well as ones you can buy). Then just set the one you want!
---
Hmmm, this gives me ideas...
---
Good luck. Try to find teammates who play the same amount you do. There are a lot of new quest lines thanks to Wild Appalachia. If it’s not hooking you after a week, try another game out.
---
I think you're referring to flair on reddit? For example, mine says Windego. 
---
If that's what you mean, it's an option in the sidebar on the right-hand side of this subreddit. If you're having trouble finding it, try using ctrl+F and searching for flair. I'm not sure how to edit your flair option on mobile.

The Grenadier perk does not help. It's still pathetic.

I completed the event while inside defiance searching for stuff. Only killed the three scorched on the way in.
---
That’s exactly what I was thinking.

I think the OP means here, on Reddit. Like you're says "reclamation day" next to yours. I've seen others say "brotherhood of steel", "responders", "enclave" and so forth.

My favorite quote in any game ever. It really applies to real life, not just the game.
---
Try sending them an essay, they seem to love them.
---
I'd be cool with 3* legendaries dropping minimum of 2* star gear. They are clearly planning for eventually having 5*, so I think -1* minimum would be a good balance.
---
I have a 3* golf club... don't recall effects, I'll have to get back to you on that after i logon. If i recall it was bloodied and power attack.
---
Aside the fact that bugs are not corrected in several months, but that old bugs already corrected start to occur again in every update (like not being able to respawn after death when encumbered) not only is disappointing but also a waste of money from BGS and work hours from the developers. I always play solo because my friends are not a Fallout fan as I am, and after collecting eight nuke codes, collecting a nuclear key card, killing everything inside Alpha Silo, decrypting the code, launching a nuke, having the help of other guys on server (because this community is bravely passionate), when the Queen is about to die she goes to the edge of the map. It is so frustrating to see this happen with the main, end game boss, that I cannot say more.
---
So, got into game, went and did a quick full clear. Nine legendary drops. Eight from ghouls, one from a radstag, 4x weapon, 5x armor. All 1 star. 
---
Confirmed that you landed on a couple unlucky servers, or servers where the zone had already been cleared by other players.
---
That's brilliant. 👍
---
But there is never any camp there? When I see players there, they are consistently in the exact same spot. Doubt everyone would run to the same spot to fast travel. 
---
But good point about it being dead center. I'm now wondering if it's a display glitch showing players in the middle of a fast travel that's lagging out. The server puts their position marker there until the connection stabilizes.
---
Because people worse than me exist
---
Whatever I'll buy a duped gun. They are cheaper then people wanting 70k for legacy weapons. They fix the economy and give everyone a better chance at a even playing field while Bethesda nerfs everything.
---
I get your point about their profit margins, but a lot of us have already paid them full price for the game. It's not our fault that they released it way too early and are now facing the consequences and therefore, money sink, that is all the problems inherent with the game.
---
Todays has been out for little bit. There are others out right now as well
---
Yeah, they’re pretty sweet.
---
Thanks! I'm pretty sure I've got the exact one I'm after locked in but I'd still like to see what you have! Might start collecting them and opening a proper Caddyshack maybe?
---
whats the side bar?
---
Figured it out! Go to the subreddit on the app and in the upper right hand corner click on the three dots. It has the change your flair option there :)
---
You do realize the irony in this is actually you, right? 
---
The sheer lazyness required to actually be upset about entering a password is... well, jesus, that’s just stupid on every level possible. Security wise, lazyness wise, just plain fact there are better things to complain about...
---
PS4 doesn't have this problem I guess
---
It’s common for several to be present ever since FO76 didn’t get cancelled by sheer rage.
---
How's the delay on it? From what I could tell, it looked like ~200-300ms delay between you pressing the control and the game reacting
---
How did you guess my password was #97234. That’s creepy!
---
They made nuka cola more practical for the classic trip in a bottle.
---
Neat idea. But I don’t think it could be automated readily, at least not to that detail. Not with a voiceover. 
---
Something along the lines of a text based ad, maybe. But I’d say the level of player input would need to be limited; like from a preset list.
---
Pfft, you call that scary? I was chased down a dark tunnel by an invincible, naked, headless scorched
---

Thanks!
---
On wifi it's not much of a delay. It's almost pretty accurate to me playing on my computer. I tried on my controller and it works fine but...
---
Block and swing are swapped and the key used for pov or camp mode doesn't work since it uses the steam overlay for the function. I want to remove that function and make it what its supposed to be.
---
I can't stand having an auto receiver on my handmades. I understand the idea of bursting but it's waaaay too easy to get into a bad situation and end up using a ton of ammo unnecessarily. A three round burst would be a sensible solution.
---
That's half of market value.  You could be getting more caps, but it's your store.
---
Sounds like an opportunity to introduce the Escrow Vendor
---
A trusted third party vendor bot that can hold item(s) in escrow while property moves from one party to another, even if both parties are from the same account
---
Perhaps a time based system on top of any caps paid for services to ensure it's not used as some kind of perpetual storage to side step weight  limits
---
I like it!
---
Is that where the behemoth spawns? Is there a small lake there?
---
With playstations remote play app i can do this too, with any game. Granted i need to be on the same wifi network as my ps4
---
TSE is still a relatively strong combination because it generates two +20% explosions (or +32% with max demo expert), and the +25% damage from TS also boosts each explosion.
---
TS itself is terrible. The +25% damage isn't worth it for the massive accuracy/spread penalty.
---
About 40% of the legendary weapons that drop are Mutant weapons.
---
I font even run Starched Genes...
---
I’m thinking this could be it’s own atom shop collection
---
Okay I'll go there and check it out
---
This is the much more likely scenario. 
---
OP, was the vending machine powered and showing the camp icon on the map?
---
I'd definitely only do it, being that low, with others. But no need for PA if you don't carry junk on you (as if you die, there's then no real consequence).
---
I sell most half price. But I have one I double the price on and cannot keep them. Have sold out of them every day and have to hop to find more.
---
Its a latency glitch, been around for a while and its kinda hit and miss but they never spread to the area their supposed to. 
---
Basically the grenade itself seems to blow up the MIRVs before they have a chance to spread out and cluster explode. Probably wont be fixed for a while as those and the nuka quantum have been glitched since day one
---
At least this shows promise that we can play Fallout 76 on both PC and PS4 while mobile. Now we need to have Xbox and the capability of playing on cell service.
---
Nice one mate, thanks!
---
[This screenshot highlights the sidebar, and shows where the flair options are.](https://i.imgur.com/rMsd6kN.jpg)

That would be a lazy fix. Then it becomes "don't like racists, or hate? Don't turn it on", and that's not an option. I've played far too many games that allow that shit, to think it wouldn't be an issue. Hell, people do whatever they can to bypass even Minecraft censors, so I highly doubt the toxic players that have caused nothing but strife as is, wouldn't act like toddlers that momma said could swear....it's a no win idea.

I'm proud to say that my gang's prolific raiding has made many pacifists. We're spreading non-violence through violence.
---
No, all movement speed boosts are capped at either 20 or 25% (not sure which), so at best you get +5% extra for Speed Demon on top of Squad Manuevers 2.
---
This is a nice idea, but I doubt it will ever happen. You can always just do what I do and buy any one star weapon or armour that's less than 100 caps from player or NPC vendors and then cash it in for scrip. Good way to spend caps in my opinion.

Is there a certain level I should do this at?
---
Protip: They don't need to be alive for your viewfinder to tag them.
---
It just makes for a more interesting picture when they assume a pose.
---
Its increased its damage so obviously it makes a difference
---
ok so its on the main subreddit outside the post community options, Thanks!
---
Coal is for the water purifier I think?
---
Yes please!!!
---
Usually every server I go into I see people there as well, it's rather interesting. 
---
Occasionally there is a camp for someone there, most of the time without a vendor, but I wonder like you if it's a glitch or just so close to the center it's popular.
---
Saying the real problems...
---
Maybe I don't understand workshops, but why would you grab one on the way out. I thought they were only benefical while your on the server.
---
Lmao you're new, give it a few weeks of the same repetitive, unoriginal posts and you'll be tired of it too. Not trying to harp on you, but posting here is completely pointless. Lots of people feel the need to post the same thing thats been posted before so they can get the karma (likes) and feel like the center of the conversation. Quite annoying when Bethesda just announced a feedback forum a couple weeks ago.
---
Usually it's a mixture of doing preferred events for legendaries and junk, selling junk to make caps do I can peruse other players' camps and shops, do Daily or Weekly quests, and hunt down the occasional bounty.
---
Well said - didn't even bother to consume the plan I was so into thinking about it 🤦‍♂️
---
The US govt agreed with you.
---
Where are my Bone Clubs?!  I've only gotten one from the Purveyor so far.
---
And when I’m already selling 1400 caps worth of items to the vendors daily?  This is a way to exceed to ‘normal’ 1400 daily cap limit from traditional vending. 
---
Hell, that’s why I sell Diluted Stims &amp; Radaway for 3 caps each, etc. 
---
My default is 20% of the base cost (usually rounded down to the nearest 9) to save the customer a bit; the 10% tax means I’d lose it anyways, so why charge it to the customer?
---
I'm surprised you're surprised
---
It's it called lever gun plans
---
If u can manage to make enough ammo I would use it
---
Thinking about it, its probably because its the center of the map, as the other commenter said its cheaper to teleport, but adding to that its probably a focal point for people to trade stuff to their mule characters.
---
Drop Bullet Shield rather than Blocker. Bullet Shield does almost nothing when you're in max-level PA (the 40 DR works out equivalent to about 2.5% damage reduction), while Blocker is fantastic in tricky situations.
---
Power Patcher should be a swap-in, not a fighting perk.
---
No, thats further to the south east. This is north of Whitesprings.
---
Not really. You’ll know when shit gets too sketchy. Then ask for help.
---
That would give anyone nightmares.
---
TLDR the title
---
Idk about the shotguns, but most of the prime recievers add a few damage to ur total, and the obvious extra the scorched and SBs.  
---
Its a trade off tho.....farming the materials is a regular thing for some people and a pain in the ass for others. 
---
I made both my LMGs prime, and i think its worth it. But i can also get the materials and plants i need from whitesprings.... So its a nuke zone fairly often, even if i didnt nuke it.
---
It’s kind of different tho in mine craft most servers are full of toxic 10 yr olds but in my albeit limited experience fo76 has an amazing player base I haven’t run into a toxic player once
---
Putting it in plain text on your PC doesn't void anything about 2 factor. Actually the 2nd factor would help if someone got the password.  
---
Yeah, it could be stolen if someone got access to the local machine, but that would have to be a very specific place to look in an ini file that only exists on machines with fo4 installed. Then only an astronomically small group of those people would have their passwords in that file. No one in the world would take time to exploit something with  so few possible targets.
---
It's a bug. That's where uranium fever pops up too but we know it doesn't actually show up there.
---
Shotgunner and rifleman is what you're going for yes?
---
You scum! This is why we need to rid the wasteland of all mutants!
---
I do about the same, since I usually hit the 1400 daily cap from traditional vendors anyways. 
---
Usually either 20 or 25% of base cost, rounded down to nearest ‘9’; why charge the customer an extra cap that I’m going to lose to the 10% tax anyways.
---
Mail Todd a giant box of Ray-Bans with porn photos glued to them.  Tell him those go along with your inappropriate ban.
---
Yes
---
It is normally a weekly challenge to claim one. Timing is habit from when workshops made you pvp vulnerable.
---
First time is for caps, second run of the session (if it pops that soon) is for scrap steel to feed my ammo store.
---
DANGER ZONE
---
I found it can occasionally spawn in Junk Piles, it's only happened a few times though.
---
&gt;Hope syntax is ok
---
Took one look.
---
It's not.
---
Hilarious.
---
There is one that spawns in the open world naturally, that’s identical to the one from the claw machines.
---
Just FYI, it’s based on the type of container. It’s not really location specific.
---
Run two computers. Put the other one in-game with you. 2 shops, empath character, and always have a map!
---
I'm pretty sure you don't have to be a certain level to start the quest chain.  Just read them and it'll add the quests.  You can also run through The Burrows in Harper's Ferry.  I don't think there's any quest to guide you to that one, so just go to Harper's Ferry and then go towards an icon on your compass that looks like a water droplet. 
---
They added a mini-dungeon type deal at Arktos Pharmacy as well.  It's supposed to be for several level 50+ characters, but your mileage may vary on how successful you'd be if you went it alone or with a small party.  It's doable alone if you're geared correctly; up until the lvl 100 enemies spawn in.
---
Just check through [the roadmap](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/40o6r9tR5VkoMudGUgl9qg/fb745bd7f94a83991f95c53cf6bb8b8a/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-10-EN.jpg) and see what you've missed.
---
I recommend starting the Pioneer Scout questline and knocking out 3 of those challenges so you can get the backpacks.
---
What are you trying to do? Break the economy?
---
IIRC the sprint speed's the same in PA but the run speed is \~15% slower. Speed Demon works both in and out of PA though, and at any movement speed.
---
Same. Most are at 3/5 even though I've been to every location on the map.
---
Haha nice.. time line dont work.. but maybe a long lost cousin.. maybe Sheffield is the last name.. haha
---
Probably asking too much from the ancient engine they use.   
---
I don't think they'd be able to easily implement it, but it would be pretty damn nice.   
---
They honestly should have modded the engine more, or just made a new one if they wanted to make an online game.. it doesn't seem like a great fit, since we have basic online features missing that are more than likely almost impossible to implement without dozens or hundreds of hours of work.
---
😂it’s fine all of us were noobs at one point good job taking one for the team
---
Tell them to "git gud"
---
I’ll take cringey midwestern lawnfare for $200, Alex ...
---
Thanks man you too
---
Aren’t Marine Wetsuits still a good profit turner to the normal vendors?  Isn’t it like a base value of 180 or something?
---
Engineers uniform? Where’s that spawn in?
---
none that are going to admit it outside a dbmb...
---
The prime receiver has the same damage as the Hardened receiver against non-scorched enemies.
---
If you have another good shotgun then you can prime one of them, but if it's your main weapon then you'll never keep up with the flux costs.
---
Selling at 250c many players buy 3 or more. I get way more caps for an easy to craft item
---
You can sort the menu
---
The ironic part is these people think they have the moral high ground. 
---
My crew gets threatened with this kind of thing all the time. Sometimes we'll troll them a little bit on text to see if they'll say something we can report THEM for. Once every week or so one of us gets a message from Microsoft saying thanks for help making it a better place, so someone, not us, is getting banned (xbox). We're pretty much only talking about a communication ban, usually spanning a day to 2 weeks , you can still play.

Uh as far as I know you can only get it from tech data

Most of the new stuff is well suited to low-to-mid levels. The Arktos Pharma event and the final step of the sheepsquatch quest are suicide without strong characters though.
---
You don't *have* to be on your same wifi connection.  You can connect to your ps4 remotely with the app too.  I've played from across the state, from work, from a friend's apartment, etc...
---
As far as I know though, the app is only available for PC, IOS, and the Vita.  I use the Vita myself.  When my connections are strong the stream itself is great.  The only thing is, playing on Vita is limiting since you have to use the touchpad on the back or tap the screen to use L2/L3 and R2/R3 functionality.  You can buy an attachable grip for it that will add buttons for these, but i've never made the splurge to buy one.
---
I'm with you.. if it was just be part of hunter/hunted or monster mash I would do them.. but seeing as I dont use God Teir anything and I'm not a fan of PVP in this game I do not think I would win them enough
---
Wow, well done! This has got some serious style, and I like it a lot!
---
Just because it's comprehensible doesn't make it okay. You make a game to make the money and it's not making the money so they're directing their attention towards the developments with dollar signs attached and not on the joy from playability. 
---
No es bueno, Bethesda
---
Oh, i thought you had to be on the dame wifi, guess i just wasn’t on a strong enough connection when i tried
---
This is fucked up.
---
As are the deep pocketed combat armor plans, conveniently.
---
Haha, that's awesome!
---
Simply put, exploits damage ingame economy which in turn damages bethsedas pockets if not left unchecked because people wont buy things that they can exploit for, GTA is one of the biggest signs of this with how quickly they patch off any cash n dupe glitches that are substantial enough and cash wipe people, the game glitches are caused by multiple scripts all trying to run &amp; load at the same time and cause conflicts which isnt a new thing for bethseda so you would think theyd work on the load order or something of they're actual game engine but they are making steady improvements, just give them time by the end of all the updates they have planned i can almost guarantee the game will be how it should be., game companies are being put under more and more strain to put out games every financial year which is ridiculously fast for some of the level of detail were seeing in current day games.

Consider yourself lucky. Just a taste of what this community has been through: The Christmas Noob Hunt. Christmas Eve, through the following week was just hell for anyone that got this game as a gift. On Xbox we had to band together through a few Facebook groups to fight back, so these kids wouldn't be forced off their new game by asshats using bugs to bypass slap damage, to kill anyone. Then we have my groups last paid bounty: 15k to deal with a group of Male teens harassing only female players, just for being female. Yes, this game has gotten infinitely better since Bethesda took away nearly every way to harass players, but that doesn't mean it's all gone. If we give these people more room to hate  they will suck it up, and make use of it like crazy. I've already seen toxic hate via the letters, and neon signs in game as it is. We don't need more ways to do it.
---
That's what you get for being a degenerate gambler. I hope you keep getting wood armor until you come up with something more fun to do than grind legendaries.
---
He might not have been aware of it working that way. I didn’t realize it the first day or two I think. 
---
I actually originally set my vendors in an attached hallway parallel to my house, with a door I could lock. Once I realized only powered machines made my camp visible, I removed the lock and ran the power through to my private residence and setup a switch on that side. 
---
I even put in crafting stations and a nice bed &amp; guitar in the ‘customer hallway’.  Everything you could need, but I still have my ‘personal space’. 
---
I even leave my purifiers unlocked. I’m not at my camp frequently enough to collect them all in time. At least someone can use them.
---
&gt; You're speaking about something you seem to know nearly nothing about, claiming quality should be achieved in a specific time frame.
---
Somebody fast-track this guy to executive management!
---
Carnivore / Herbivore or Twisted Muscles
---
It does, but I like launching the game thru steam for Overlay and screenshot
---
I'm sorry you're not understanding. Let's try to make things simpler for you. 
---
Bethesda isn't Steam.
---
Steam peak times refers only to users logged into the Steam distribution platform. Not concurrent players actively playing games.
---
Updates to the Steam platform are completely different than updates to an active world game. If you want to compare apples to apples, you should compare updates to the Steam platform to updates to the Bethesda launcher, which are quick, simple, and have little impact. Even if Steam is down, you can play most games in offline mode if they do not require an active connection. Steam platform updates are also not immediately mandatory and can come at any time of day (I regularly ignore them and they're often not applied until days later when I happen to reboot and restart Steam). So your comparison here to FO76 world server updates completely falls flat.
---
Again, you're trying to use faulty numbers. Just because players login at noon in the US and it coincides with players logging in at 5 PM in Europe doesn't mean the EU makes up the majority gaming playerbase, and vice versa. You're using generic statistics and trying to make them fit your narrative. Provide actual statistics that show x number of players login in the EU versus x number of players logging in by country during x time window, and you'll have numbers you can actually use if they actually show more logins from EU than elsewhere. Those statistics do not exist as far as I've been able to find. For example, my system that I work on all day has Steam on and logged in slightly before, and during the entire peak EU time and beyond. I'm sure many others in the US are just like me. This punches massive holes in your theory because you have no breakdown by region.
---
I'm pretty sure someone datamined mailboxes at some point so I'm sort of hoping that interplayer mailing is going to be a thing sooner or later.
---
nice thanks for the info I love that arm
---
A lot of vendors keep there camp there since it's close to vault 76 and it's a free fast travel point but hes probably also helping new players out as well.

Either that or he's farming for stuff. There's some decent farming spots around there.

And if you should learn anything from Reddit, it's that upvotes are more indicative of truth than personal experience and reasonable expectations.  Good thing too, since you seem to be heavily lacking in both of the latter.
---
Yes, 104 was his level.
---
Damn, that sounds cool. I really hope this becomes a possibility one day. Fallout 76 is softcore enough that even with the restrictions of playing from a phone it would still be doable for most of the game
---
I had to remove the video for now. I gotta clean it up so that it looks better. My apologies.
---
Yeah and I hope Bethesda makes it happen.
---
The one no one knows about is how to initiate the mannequin pentagon. I’ll keep that secret to myself forever and I think it’s hilarious nobody has figured it out. It’s a random event where you are surrounded by 5 mannequin.
---
If anything you sound likes someone who is 'super butt hurt mad' as the kids say these days. You make inane generalizations on an entire population. Everyone who PVPs is a duping, cheating, assholes who seek e-peen. If anything it seems you're quick to throw excuses when you die. "Well they MUST have had duped weapons and they cheated! How else would I die?!?!" It's no different from me assuming you're a whining man-baby who assumes the role of a victim at every opportunity. Is this you? I don't think so but it's the way you act there blaming everyone for your small upset.
---
Okay, I’ll see if we can go to the lobby
---
When you're on the same connection it will be stronger for sure, but yeah man, you can play from anywhere.  Just don't do what I did a few times and turn your PS4 off before you try.  It's gotta be in rest mode to be able to unlock it remotely.
---
You're missing out on some damg opportunity not having bloody mess in luck or gun fu and adrenaline in agility. Other than that, I wouldn't keep the hacker and weapon artisan perks on all the time because they are situational and not always needed. Other than that, it looks okay. I'm sure there's other things that some other players may wanna add that I can't think of.

104 is his severity level in accordance with the eclaves most wanted criminal database .. he was prolly trying to wave you over to have his way with you and abuse your body for his unsavvory pleasure .. next time you see one of these degenerates 'wave' you on or attempt some other horrific gesture I suggest you stand your ground and attack viciously!!
---
Okay I gotcha. Then the only things would be the damg cards I mentioned. Those three cards will do wonders for your damg output

Could be. I can't even remember the name, just that even at 15 strength it increases your carry weight.

Try this analogy on for size. You run a website based on the East coast, and you track traffic hits to that website, but only by number of hits, not where the hits came from. You see a large uptick in traffic from 11 AM to 2 PM EST. Is your first conclusion that because this is 4 PM to 7 PM UTC, that the majority of your traffic is European? No, that would be stupid, and rather conceited if you happened to live in the UTC timezone.

Right now this post has 366 upvotes which is semi substantial on the fo76 subreddit, especially since criticism of this game gets downvoted to oblivion. 
---
It shows that the consumers of this product are starting to get tired of the ridiculous bugs in this game lasting 8 months. 
---
I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask for my game to play like a AAA mmo rpg after 8 months since release.
---
I want to know if they actually have armor or costumes before I waste 25 caps travelling there
---
Exploits prevent them from earning money, bugs don't.
---
Yeah it's +2 which makes the PA +10 str total, then 100 from excavator set bonus, and 2x50 from calibrated shocks makes it a damn dump truck of junk carrying.

Also, another Ohio-an!

There’s a piercing mod as well.

Flux isn’t something I’m overflowing on.

Should I remove mutations and cards and I never use vats
---
Maybe have your buddy put points into sneak and escape artist. The enemies should lose him when he crouches and then they'll turn their aggro on you.
---
That’s childish. I’ve been killed in my workshop, but I always make sure I’ve deposited my junk first (like, a stash is the first thing I build if I actually have any junk) and only build the bare minimum for what I’m doing (usually farming fusion cores). 
---
It’s part of the game. I do think that there should be a little time between contesting the workshop and PvP being fully enabled, though. 
---
I once got ‘hi ambushed’ when one player stopped to wave hi and offer a trade... while their teammate went up to my workshop and started a claim.  So PvP got started immediately between me and both of them, so he immediately lit me up at point blank range; his two buddies rushed up and there was no way I had any chance. 
---
That was kind of cheap. 
---
So I equipped Aqua Boy, took one of their workshops elsewhere on the map (Tyler County Dirt Track) and then jumped into the nearby lake (still within the ‘contested zone’, however). I was deep enough I couldn’t take damage and they couldn’t reverse the contesting timer. 
---
I went and made a sandwich and came back to all three of them still trying to shoot me from the shoreline. All three of them.  Wasting a ton of ammo.  And I’m laughing my ass off on open area chat the entire time. 
---
I probably got reported for that...

Upvote, but bad example. 
---
Vendors need to take a lap around a couple servers checking prices, and a lot of this would fix itself.
---
aw too bad pc here.
---
Try again
---
Because the network connection and all transfered data are unencrypted, plain text. It would open them up to them up to yet another clusterfuck.
---
i can craft you calib shocks
---
Have it charge a 1% transaction fee. Since 50 caps is the max (non-wanted) you can lose, then depositing 25k costs you 250 caps. That’s the equivalent of 5 ‘lost PvP battles’.
---
Ever since New Vegas.
---
Try using the cryolator maybe? Not trying to be a smartass. Just guessing that would slow them down.
---
I'm selling them for 666 on PC.
---
I think it might have something to do with level disparities. I see low level SMs do this much more frequently than higher level SMS.
---
My condolences
---
I've had a 3* one for months, seems like a different issue to the wooden armour
---
Build a fertilizer in your base, and some razorgrain. Attempt to milk from maximum distance. If it kicks, kill it. Repair, repeat. If you have enough razorgrain and steel, you can complete this in about 5 minutes.
---
It might help to sneak up on them. You shouldn't have to go too close to them before you are prompted to milk them. It worked for me and I also have plague walker. It might take a couple of server hops if someone milked them before you. Hope this helps.
---
Im a lvl 12 rn rocking a wolf fedora and some guy got pissed because hes done dozens of encrypteds and hasnt gotten a single one
---
Damn...I sold mine for 350 caps each on Xbox
---
But then you wouldn't be forced to kill them over and over and over and over and over. . .
---
Exploits are and will always be priority #1.
---
I only use 2 unyielding pieces in my set
---
&gt;Since player vending I've seen more nukes. My guess was people's stock was running low and they wanted more to sell.
---
That's been my experience as well, and if no one else launches them I do.
---
Really lol the fedora is probably my most dropped item, done it at least 12 or so times and managed to get all the cosmetics.
---
This will just result in less 3 star enemies. In other words, no actual change.
---
Jokes on them, I've never had 20k caps at once
---
Travel to a place close to totw and walk there works forarktos might  for this
---
Data ass.
---
The repair cost on 51b is fucking atrocious compared to t60. The slight benefit to rad resist or whatever isn't worth it.
---
Okay sounds easy enough. What is a fertilizer, like a pen for the Brahmin? And do I need to have the perk card to  pacify one or will one just come when I build that structure?
---
im here
---
Good to know thank you!
---
Your welcome friend
---
Yeah mang
---
Oof 1600
---
Pretty sure it will, but the odds of that person sticking around for the nuke is small to none. Remember everyone gets a system wide warning. Personally i always check where it will drop and I'm willing to bet most everyone else does too.
---
I'd tap that.
---
That's why they only did 2k...most everyone has a few thousand...
---
I do wonder if I'll see this tactic with bobble heads, magazines, etc.
---
Yeah, that’s the fastest way to convince me to server hop...
---
just use a hazmat suit
---
For the golden glove, I'd maybe pay that.
---
general plan is I check the dailies. After I stop laughing over how ridiculous 2 or 3 of them are I do the 1 or 2 doable ones for the day. Same thing for the weekly stuff. Make a small amount of progress on one of the long term challenges, like mod/repair a weapon type, kill a bunch of a type of enemy with a certain type of weapon type stuff. Then I work on a scout badge. If all the fast traveling around the map during those puts me in the general area of a side quest or story quest I do that. Same goes for any other random interesting things I might run across that distract me since outside of the daily/weekly atom stuff there's no reason to rush from one thing to the next.
---
I had no idea 😮 that certainly explains why I'm blowing through them so quickly. Ugh.
---
Ooh never noticed, I guess I stopped doing it before I started wanting to find them more. Been wanting to get the high capacity back pack mod anyway, gonna kill 2 birds with one stone from now on. Thanks for the tip!
---
im at arktos.  how long you think til youre ready?
---
Todd.
---
Definitely any ghoul that jumps out from the middle of nowhere
---
I'm laughing right now because that's literally what all the haters were parroting on this subreddit a month after release.  Get on the "This game is broken" bandwagon!  Toot toot!
---
Turning off the power doesn't prevent purchases. It just removes your camp from the map
---
Coming now
---
How did you get out of the Vault and still were level 1?  It’s been a while since I started a new character, but I could swear all my toons were level 2 by the time I exited. 
---
To answer your question, he probably was wanting to help. There are far more ‘helpers’ than ‘griefers’.
---
Also worth noting - for VATS builds, ultra light is better than deep pocketed on your armor. You lose a little bit of carry weight, but ultralight adds AP.
---
I'm sitting on caps and looking for a 3 star legendary lever rifle that does over 300 dmg. If you're on XB1 message me Kidliquid01 is my Gamertag.
---
Yao guai
---
In terms of visuals, the Snallygaster.  But the Wendigo is one of the few enemies that actually tries to go for a jump scare in certain locations of the Mire.
---
I'd also go with "the Scorchbeast corpse that drops on my head after fast traveling."
---
Nope
---
I’ve got the exact same one, I don’t run a bloodied build either.
---
Silvered because 🌮🤹🏽‍♀️🎤🎰 yeah, let’s art!
---
Use the taunt emote. Works wonders.
---
Ha, I just got my first Scorchbeast dropped on my head today.
---
My issue is since switch to a heavy build the tank killer for heavies, Stabilized, requires PA.
---
One appears every time you rebuild it, and is a separate entity that has a chance for you to successfully milk.
---
https://youtu.be/0Bn88rmA-xA
---
It used to force level you to show the mechanic of the cards and special so someone skipped something.
---
The Interloper in the concealed tunnel in Lucky Hole Mine.  Depending on how laggy the server is, the eerily subtle movements of its limbs and tentacles make the whole Cthullu aspect very creepy.
---
I have seen pumpkin pies in the open world. The ones that go bad if you don't eat them. Never saw a perfectly preserved one anyplace but in the machines.
---
You’d think the bugs that ruined the game’s perception from the beginning would’ve made priority but OH WELL
---
+karma
---
Okay, thank you, I’ll give that a try.
---
Meh, the Brotherhood would disagree with you. What is more canon-breaking is the fact that there is armor made from used tires and animal bones that somehow makes you invisible when you stand still. There are a lot of things in this game that don't make a lot of sense, but I would argue that power armor is one of the more logical elements. It does make for a weird gameplay balance dynamic, I'll give you that.
---
Do you guys get paid by Bethesda to defend every single stupid shit they do? Honestly. How hard is it to put a stupid option to remember my password like 97% of the other videogames out there? 
---
I knew this sub was a shithole, but not on this level, some fans truly are mediocrity personified.
---
Pointing out how absurdly lazy you are has ZERO to do with Bethesda. Absolutely ZERO.
---
Gotcha that makes more sense.
---
Epic gamer moment happening
---
I think they severely nerfed them. I'm stuck on this one as well. I haven't seen a single deathclaw hide since the update dropped.
---
cool, once my character who uses it the most gets up to 45 I'll probably take you up on that
---
Wait to see how plenty of scumbags defend their practice and say “bUt mY ecOnoMy maTteRs”.
---
Bethesda won’t fix bugs unless they’re related to losing money. That’s it.
---
Yep.
---
I just ran into my first snallygaster tonight. Saw it was level 14, figured how tough could it be......
---
I ran. I ran so far away.
---
Wait what? Where's it in lucky? I've been there but haven't seen anything like that
---
Now we just need to have it where we can play it without having to stream it and off our mobiles.
---
Funny you mention that. Today I killed a SB at my base looked at the loot and decided to take just the armor. I then fast traveled to the Whirsprings Train Station. Once I was able to move the same SB I killed teleported on top of me still with the same inventory I left behind at my Camp.
---
If I should learn anything from reddit is that the official FO76 subreddit is a shithole of a sub full of Bethesda dickriders who can’t accept the game is still broken months after release. All I read around here are excuses.
---
I feel bad for people that have 40 plus characters in there passwords
---
Myself, a swift FU would feel a lot better, especially for those like I just encountered during campfire tales event.
---
I started the event, for someone to travel in and run up and stand atop the lookout tower. Doing absolutely no work the entire time.
---
That would be awesome I could play during school lol
---
People would just make multiple mule characters. Thatll be the first thing i would do
---
High school?
---
Totally agree with this. Hell, they could even have some NPC “run” the market and could even charge us a consignment fee of sorts to list our items and it would make much more sense than the caps tax they take out on us now at our personal vendors. That way it’s sort of a universal place where we can go to buy items from anyone on the server.  Maybe even from multiple servers, though I don’t know if that’s possible. This could create a real market, with real prices that fluctuate and then you would also solve the problem of the huge price discrepancies between personal vendors. This could also form a sort of player hub they could expand on to allow group formation to complete events and stuff. Just seems like a pretty logical MMO staple to me.
---
I’m with you - it’s the wendigo
---
The weird thing is how this post got so many likes. I've seen posts similar to this get down voted to hell.
---
It's a good thing that Bethesda fixes exploits fast. Could they fix bugs faster? Sure. However, we have what we have.
---
Surprisingly middle school lol I just graduated and now I'm going to high school next year
---
The Vaultdweller.
---
Wait for a nerd to tell you:
---
“tHerE aRe mOrE iMpOrtAnT tHingS tO fiX aNd adD” 
---
Like **something something that makes bethesda lose money**
---
If you keep to your right hand side of the tunnels as you explore, there's some side passages that are cleverly concealed by overgrowth and outcroppings, take those hard turns and explore further.  You'll find some cultist areas, some costumes and masks, cultist blades and daggers, lots of lore behind the cults, and eventually a breathing living "entity" that is right out of the Cthullu mythos, slumbering on the cave surface.
---
What would it count as? Rifleman? Commando?
---
&gt; **what is the appropriate response?** 
---
The appropriate response is silence. They are full of shit.  Some guy with a bloodied build once hit me with a death claw and died on the spot because I had reactive plates on my power armor. 
---
  
---
Sent me messages saying I cheated and that he was going to have me banned.
---
I'm still here.
---
Find a workshop with lead, claim and build an extractor on the deposits, lock, build turrets, collect semi regularly.
---
Charleston fire department, any nuke silo, look for weights in the weight room. Both high schools?
---
Instead of multiple new types of receivers (for the various options usually available) why not just a simple mode switch key that's available when an automatic type receiver is attached? I'm not sure if there is room for any more buttons though due to compatibility with standard controllers.
---
O.o congratulations and make sure you don't get into trouble. It's going to be hard for you as a freshman. Trust me, I had to deal with people who thought they could do whatever they like.
---
Also make sure you plan accordingly for your future after high school. Now is the time to make the right choices. If you have a hobby you enjoy, try to mold off it and find jobs that are based off it.
---
Damn, that’s one hole in the plan. I’d say probably commando but since they’re both perception it wouldn’t really matter. Best case is some new perk cards that could include 3 round support.
---
sure, i can also make X01 shocks.
---
I think I've been through some of the tunnels, but never saw anything because of how dark it is.ill go through it again.Thanks
---
Look for pencils, easy source lol
---
Close the game, restart and try again. That's worked for me every time I've had a camera challenge that wouldn't register.
---
Edit 6? Enjoyable? Again? Was it ever enjoyable kek
---
I don’t know any though.
---
Thanks! I’ll check up on the fire department.
---
I wonder if there is a list of players who dupe, across all platforms, so we know who to avoid.
---
If not, this might be a good thing to set up.
---
gym at flat woods gym at firehouse gym at penitentery and the gyms at each of the launch silos.
---
While we're at it, why not double legendary drops, double stash, double camp budget, double damage, double accounts, double kabobs, double creole, double gumbo. There's pan double, deep double, stir-double. There's pineapple double, lemon double, coconut double, pepper double, double soup, double stew, double salad, double and potatoes, double burger, double sandwich.
---
That-that's about it.
---
Room temperature IQ, that's hilarious.
---
this
---
Ok, I'll try that now.
---
This is pretty freakin’ cool.
---
You know about lucky hole mines I presume. Hover over workshops and it tells you which produce lead
---
Yeah I'm looking forward to it I'm finally going to a school that has an actual football team lol all of my old schools were "soccer" schools so I had no fun there lol. I appreciate the advice nonetheless
---
Oh my god yes!!!  So freaking frustrating!!
---
All toys, baby rattles, blocks.
---
Thank you for doing this. Really helpful info.
---
Nah. I don’t really explore too much.
---
Thanks, I didn't know if I was doing it wrong. Do you think farming death claw island would be any good?
---
no one watches it, but i also found a murdoch mysteries easter egg. say what you want about bethesda and their coding skill, but their easter egg game is far and beyond anyone elses. imho at least.
---
This should really be hotfix worthy
---
Go try it. Should tell you how much scrip before you actually turn it in. Just have to initiate the scrip machine and select the weapon.
---
I'm currently playing with people, if that was you sending a message I can't view it for some reason
---
Grafton steel, and Charleston junk yard each have one. Breach and clear is a good way to get lead ore too
---
 LOL. Every tin can has one Lead. A tin can trap has 9 cans. There are at least 6 tin can traps at Camden Park around the Raider area. That is 54. 
---
 Now you will be happy every time you see a tin can trap. ;)
---
I dunno, how long have we known the purveyor? Isn't it possible that maybe, just maybe, she's not 100% ethical? I mean, she's just one step up from a used-car salesman fer crissakes. Caveat emptor!
---
I just have the burning staff plan plan, I must have sold the others.
---
4 star weapons aren't really 4 star, they're 3 star with a mod. So the scrip is the same, 40.
---
Good thing they added that.
---
Also go to Morgantown and read the frat party poster. Finally did this today.
---
Nope Ive been gaming since 1996 and pvped in almost all of them. the most brutal and fun pvp to be had is in ark survival evolved pvp hardcore. when you die you lose everything including your character levels. when you win you get their gear their house all of it. all the stuff these "leet" pvpers talk about like they're all just bad ass hard men exists in ARK compared to the rest of the pvp community this shit is just sad. 76 pvpers are the lamest of a pretty lame portion of the gaming population.
---
I started with a PC Jr!
---
Could you please explain what 2FA is, for all the idiot savants like myself?
---
Yeah there's some people that definitely ruin our name, but lots of us are cool and legit!
---
And you can’t make 4* any more
---
Maybe when it comes out on steam
---
I buy any legendary, bobblehead, or fusion core (if I have less than 10 already) that I find for sale for under 100 caps.
---
I have 30 2-3* mid-high tier legendary weapons in my vendor. Its right next to point pleasant so most people assume I'm low level. I put 100 stims to show I'm higher leveled.
---
I've thought about this before to myself and I think that a threat/aggro/taunt component would fit snugly with the Chr/Suppressor perk card. The short timer keeps things from getting out of hand and the perk card itself always felt to me like the type of perk card that a tank archetype would use. I don't see any glaring issues with doing it this way do you?
---
Been finding them in boxes and bins
---
Charleston has copper, ali, steel and junk. Doesn’t have lead but the Poseidon plant does.
---
Pretty sure it's just a visual glitch that happens when people first spawn into the world.
---
Did you get away?
---
Lucky hole mine, Charleston Fire dept, the weight rooms of any missile silo, top of the world(the resort just out side of it) there’s two resource spots in the hill north of the Whitespring
---
he does but it doesn't seem to work as intended often enough, they just go for him and i cannot stop it
---
I would love to have hogzillas in the game.  We could cook proper bacon.  😎
---
This! Although I'd prefer 2 shot to anti armor
---
that could be true, i have zero programming experience so i can't tell how easy/hard anything would be
---
Sigh....
---
[zzzzzip]
---
Fapfapfspfapfapfap
---
Nice. Looks a lot better than my real Danse character in FO4.
---
Breach and clear event in ash heap. That will give you a bunch of you unlock the executive boxes.
---
Also the big digger thingy in the ash heap when you take it over you can turn it on and get lead that way also.
---
Otherwise just build your camp on a lead deposit and collect every now and again.
---
VATS drains your Fusion Cores? No fucking wonder I can't do SQB and have my shit charged the entire time. Went to go do one the other night and I had like 3 cores. Figured that would be plenty to kill the queen and run around after. Nope, I was cashed out before we even downed her. I am a rifle VATS build FWIW. This is some serious bullshit.
---
you want a real challenge try sniping a guy off the back of a bred agentavis you have to hit him multiple times in the same spot to punch through the armor if he gets sight of you he can pick you up and drop you off a cliff or just flat out eat you if he dismounts and happens to be a sniper then you have to deal with the aggro of his mount plus work on the angles he could be attacking from. that is real pvp with real rewards real penalties and real pvpers.
---
Despite being in Fo4 not being able to slow VATS the radscorpion is eerie. And for new to Fo76 the honey beast
---
Quad furious 2shot AA reduced weight handmade 👌🏻
---
Bethesda Executives?
---
They don't drop from deathclaws. I've found my only one inside a green footlocker in the cranberry bog.
---
I’ll buy it
---
i have a quad cryolator, but it's not really enough to do the job, that thing burns ammo too fast.
---
that said, it's still an amazing option when the ammo are still up
---
4* doesn't exist anymore, scorched killer and sacrificial machete got fixed to not add a star one or two updates ago
---
Excavator power armor arms + 1 trip through lucky hole mine and super duper yeilded me about 1000 lead in 1 run
---
Best yield will be from lucky hole mine. The most I've gotten for ore was just shy of 600, but that's only if you have the excavator set.
---
That says nothing about that. Your diagram assumes it has to go through xbox servers when it could be more like this:
---
           XB
---
      /           \
---
You ------------- beth server
---
      \            /
---
         B acc
---
Beth server requires XB and an account for authentication but you're still connected to the server directly. The more services it has to go through to connect to the server the more latency there is. 
---
Following this diagram if beth banned your account you can't play and if Microsoft bans your account you can't play but if Beth banned your ip you can't play either.
---
There are a few games that have employed IP banning such as Battlefield and Rainbow six seige
---
I’ve never even SEEN a 4 star weapon!
---
Tin can traps in camden and top of the world work great. Top of the world also has what's apparently a very obscure cache; if you exit out the main ski lodge and head to the left, before going down the stairs there's a couple mannequins and some cannonballs/weights on the ground and in a box. Easy lead, I've only seen that spot picked clean by another player a few times
---
Harvest nuke zones with green thumb on. Also Serums that use fluorescent and yellow cake flux are the easiest to craft. I started my collection by just focusing on those serums. I can easily pull 75-100 fluorescent flux from a WS nuke zone.
---
I'm also always harvesting hardened mass glowing mass and high radiation fluids from those areas. I keep at least 30 of each on my character at all times. When I get too high on hardened mass I scrap it for Ultracite. I also always buy Ultracite when I see it 10c or under.
---
Does it bring it's damage up to the deathclaw or power fists damage with the mod?
---
Melee users could always tame. Anyone can tame, just carry a lightweight unscoped gun when you’re looking for a pet.
---
indeed it would fit amazingly, there is some crowd control in the game already and this makes it all the more frustrating that the one key perk that would bring order to the battlefield is absent. i don't need much, those 2 secs of suppressor would be more than enough to do the trick
---
What outfit is that?
---
Pictures or it doesn’t count.
---
No problem and sorry to hear that. I'm not really into sports. But also make sure you hang with those who will truly help you reach your goal. I'm guessing you are looking forward to football so you could become a football player and make it a career.
---
I talked this someone a few weeks ago. And tbh neither perk should gain governances 3round burst/tri Fire. 
---
Or at least bother perks should do the same. Rifleman3 gives 30% and commando 3 gives 30%. 
---
Adding a new perk now would gun up the system. Waiting until a new dlc that requires new perks would be ideal.
---
Yeah unscoped was the issue I had!
---
Pets can die and disappear by other means unfortunately.
---
NOT THE BEES!
---
There’s also some traps in Hunters Ridge &amp; there’s one or two at the Hot Dog place in the forest!
---
I'm the lead administrator for our Self Training System (among a slew of other system) and I and my team have used LOTS of different text to voice converters some on the internet and some locally installed I don't think its a stretch to think you can find a cheap text to voice API for this. Plus the crappier the Text to Voice is the BETTER this IS a world narrated by robots after all and it would be hilarious to hear how it would butcher some players chosen names.
---
I think it's called the Prepper Outfit, from the latest Atomic Shop update.
---
The workshop icons tell you what resource nodes they have.
---
I traveled to the Sennaca resorts where the mutants are and walked slowly to totw, but it still crashed while loading the elevator :(
---
Nope, you can only tame random spawns and deathclaw island is scripted.
---
Okay, thank you.
---
what but are you referring to? do you take pictures and they don't count? try this https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bpbn9y/psa_a_way_to_fix_your_broken_camera/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
The mothman. I came up close to the wise one and took a picture from underneath; that smile is horrifying. Also, I was once alt-tabbed while auto-walking down that long road between point pleasant and the waste disposal bunkers. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a mothman just crossing the street at the very end of that road. Probably the most terrifying thing I've seen in all 400 hours. It must be a rare scripted event, I'm pretty sure it had purple eyes
---
Yup this. Also they patched it so it no longer will display 4☆
---
Check metal crates. Also, gulpers have them from time to time. Can't confirm this myself but I believe scorchbeast guano piles should have some too
---
What platform are you on?
---
No problem
---
I had a random lvl 80 sheepsquatch wander by my camp yesterday...
---
...Editing my base in the flow of building and out of nowhere felt like i was getting mortared. 
---
Pure dumb luck a random neighbor camp spawned in to kill it with his 4 rocket turrets. Otherwise would've never seen it coming
---
..
---
Note to self need rocket turrets
---
Been saying this same thing for a while.. I can burn up an easy 5 full cores at a queen fight. I like power armor in a nuked zone, but even with power user 3 the cost to use my VATs with rifle build is just over burdening.
---
I can’t remember if it’s right there but my camp is near there and has a lead extractor but I don’t imagine that’s the reason...
---
Nice lol
---
A radio station that announced events would work. That way you could tune in of you were interested and doesn't clutter the GUI.
---
I defer to your expertise, my friend. 
---
If viable, it would be an amazing addition.
---
What is that
---
Before vending was a thing, and I was dumping a lot of stuff, I once gave a newbie a ton of plans and a bunch of other stuff for free. I just thought I’d help. Otherwise I would have just dropped them, which I’ve done a lot in the past. 
---
I found all jet packs at one persons machine for only 100 caps and I could only afford one. I see that go for so much more. I find more people are generous than greedy of those I find in game.
---
And you can farm a shit ton of acid if you server hop at Toxic Larrys 3 snallygasters always spawn there
---
Bahahaha! He really is! If he were to poke around a corner, wielding a plastic bag, I'd piss my pants!🤣
---
LOL my friend peed on an electric fence once. funniest shit I ever saw.
---
the only broken things i put in my vendor are crossbows in case anyone needs one for the archer challenge
---
Taking stuff from another players death bag during an event
---
I'm for this message, and I'm still trying to build up my character proper to run survival lol
---
Yeah, WHAT THE FUCK is this all about in the first place?! VATS draining fusion cores?!? WTF Fuels VATS when I'm not in my PA, my fucking farts!? Turn that shit off right now!
---
Wheres the proof of that?
---
Worth the perk equipped you have to walk up to it after you pacify it and tame it.
---
Wheres the proof they can ip ban?
---
I thought it was on the roof of West Tek?
---
Why is there no cross platform gaming in fallout 76 then?
---
I can imagine what the code base looks like.  When we FO76 players hear of a new feature related to, say, Fast Travel, you KNOW we all think "Oh awsome!.. but I wonder what part of some tangential thing is going to break"... I do code, and have done it for a crust, and am bewildered at what kind of structures cause the sort of random logic impacts that we see time and time again.
---
Bethesda, there's a bug (I'm on Playstation, so I don't know if this applies to all the consoles), but I'm trying to do the musician badge for the Possum challenges. I've been at both the Rusty Pick and Watoga High School playing instruments, but got no achievement for them, but I did get the achievement at Nuka-Shine. I should've gotten the badge already but to no avail.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thank you by the way for continuing the progression of keeping this game awesome! I just wanted to point out a glitch if you weren't aware of it yet.
---
Also, I'm a musician irl, it had to be the first badge I wanted to do first
---
I got the Imposter Sheepsquatch Helmet on my first go, lol.
---
For a long time I thought I accidentally stole it from someone else, because I accidentally looted the wrong bag in the chaos of trying not to lose my junk.
---
Only recently did that guilt go away when I realized it would've been impossible, since only junk drops on death, lol.
---
This is still an issue, eh? I wonder if this game will be less of a mess a year from now. Doubt it.
---
It's the only real reason I use VATS for melee.  Hitting flying things sucks.
---
Go down the main walkway and cross the bridge. 
---
On your right will be a door with a weapons workbench. Continue through that door and head up the stairs.
---
Find the big yellow cylinder marked Charlie (Or just a big C). Turn right there and there's a set of lockers in the upper part in the corner. 
---
For me it was one of the middle lockers, but it didn't signify anything until I took everything that was in it. 
---
Hope this helps!

Z and C I believe.
---
Before the option appeared as tame and pacify. Was this changed?
---
Yes. Many changes.
---
What you see on screen doesn't always match up with the damage you'll get per shot on enemies.
---
You should use Skeet Shooter (rank 3) under Perception. It affects accuracy/spread in both VATS and normal use. Also make sure you have the right mods for getting the maximum accuracy from your shotgun. Both make a big difference.
---
Also, any shotguns with TS (inc. TSE) are not so good now because the pellet spread is higher, plus now after the nerf on explosive shotguns there is less explosive damage from each pellet.
---
If you can get the *dense* or even just the *padded* mod on your chest armor, you'll be able to get closer to enemies without taking much explosive damage yourself. Use Fireproof 2-3 and Admantium Skeleton 3 (for no limb damage) too. You can even test this by standing on top of a car at WS, shooting it, and walking away like nothing even happened. But the chest armor will lose a little *condition* each time it gets blasted, so keep an eye on it and repair when needed.
---
I'm going to let you think on that.
---
One of my Deathclaws wandered off never to be heard from again.
---
Try putting you camp unit in a open area of your build space. I believe it solved mine from glitching out of bounds since my new replacement.
---
I'd love to pipe in here, but after buying the mutilated bunny head from the "atomic store" and attempting unsuccessfully to create it about a hundred fucking times, I swore off assaultron heads forever. Serious BS right there. All the prerequisite junk, perks, parts, at el, and never got the god damn thing!
---
Taunt emote? We need a ‘point and laugh’ emote.
---
No doubt! I’m done being all conduits during the Imposter SheepSquach quest just to have my loot grabbed and maybe get a 1* wood leg armor
---
Yeah, like the closest thing we have to a player market place is the large amount of player CAMPs around Whitespring, and even then its only like what five different CAMPs in the area, and then you'll have to keep fast traveling/walking to each and every single one.
---
And you can get a vpn. Ip bans are a thing of the past anyways even if they could do it
---
Lemme know what ya find out please. I'm holding on to it for now, but honestly, I kill more, faster, with basically everything else in my arsenal O_o
---
Forgive me but you may need another subreddit for that
---
I kill 3*** enemies just as fast as 1* enemies, average 5 min on the sbq, so I disagree as this would make it way too easy to farm 3** loot
---
Sorry but i'm not sure how this works to change the name. you have to log into [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) and there is a link to it? is there a breakdown on the actual ( this is how to change your name ).
---
That's already a thing...
---
This would make trading items and vendor shopping much more convenient while at work
---
What's obsurd here slick, is that despite the perk cards and impressive numbers the gun displays, even a 95% in VATS up close does less damage than basically every other gun I have. I literally wasted a half dozen perk cards on this fucking shotgun so far.
---
And those games got ip bans because people were modding. Very different. That violates xbox and psn terms of service. Duping does not
---
Swing, swing, swing, and whiff switch to gun use vats and its dead. I stopped all together trying to melee bugs for now.
---
Roleplayers.
---
I did! And not 2 minutes after I posted the above I had my first run in with Mothman by Pickets Fort. I used a lot of stimpacks tonight. But it was fun.
---
Lovely...🙈
---
There is a 3% chance I find a “HORRIBLE BUG” on here that is “GAME BRAKING” y’all are just over dramatic
---
I couldn't agree more. Rank 3 concentrated fire, rank 3 tank killer, full auto 3 star berserkers combat rifle w/+50% limb damage and a stinging magazine, plus my instigating handmade semi auto are my default weapons. I can cut through basically everything like a hot knife through butter with that com at rifle. Good fuckin times right there!
---
How do you spot a duper??? I never want to get in trouble buying something from someone or whatnot that’s duped... but I don’t know how to tell
---
tick 🙃
---
So I've gotten the responder vendor to spawn like 8-9 times at Charleston - no problem there, but haven't RNG'd my way into clean ranger outfit yet. I have seen a couple of the hunter's long coats - I bought one just to have, maybe throw it in player vending. I've never been able to get the vendor to spawn north of the long bridge though, and never at Lady Janet's, also no clean variant showing up at Alpine Cabins or up at Pricket's. Oh well, I'll keep digging at it! Thanks for all the suggestions!
---
I'll give you props for the witty retort, but even with VATS at 95%, up close and personal I get a big ole basket of useless
---
😂 I sold mine for 2000 because its a 1000 less then the vendor sells it for.
---
Legendary stuff, yeah, I'm guilty of that. I like playing with random shit for a day or two and then selling it. Bobbleheads and stuff? I'm a bit more picky. If it's a good bobblehead like +30% explosive damage for an hour I'll pay 75 for it. Something like +1 AGL? Meh. I'll give you 30 for it at most.
---
Nice!
---
Toxic Larry's has been bugged for me lately. Every time I spawn I get killed by invisible snallys.
---
Those games ip banned without psn or xbox interference.
---
Would really be cool for a photographer roleplay ;) I'm thinking a raider serial killer who takes pictures of the people they kill and post it over the walls in thier house along with some skull totems
---
I think people are launching nukes more because the new legendary vendor!
---
Where's the proof of the terrible line? The links you sent prove nothing
---
Because they decided not to.
---
Because it violates xbox and playstations term of service. Duping does not do that.
---
Yep because nobody wants that.
---
Sorry. Guess am level 2. So many new things to keep track of.  World seems so dangerous. Haven't been outside the vault in so long. Must maintain control. Can't loose it out here.
---
Lack of proof is not proof of the opposite.
---
Hence why I also mentioned a product key ban
---
Map location please?
---
Who makes the product key?
---
I wish I could call it expertise! I've probably only scratched the surface with what I use it for, a quick google search comes up with at least a hundred or more text to speech API's and with it being an online game utilizing cloud based text to speech like Azure and Google are valid options too! Heck Google's text to speech has been learning for YEARS now! No reason Fallout 76 couldn't have something like. The Process Automation side of me wants to jump in and figure this out but the My wife and Kids like me to buy them stuff like food and clothes side of my needs to whittle down the laundry list of planning, coding, and testing I currently have lined up so I can collect a pay check. I think if they ever open up modding for 76 this might be something I tinker around with just out of sheer curiosity but I'm SURE right now there are people better qualified and experienced in TTS than me.
---
[a better heavy build ](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f344c7b&amp;d=s22s32sr2sq2eu0ce0cu0ip2a04l71ls2lt2sx2pq1p10em1eh0cm0ev0ib4ic3a80a10lu2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=2cf1ei6&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
Bethesda.
---
Wheres the proof of that? They license the game to xbox and sony
---
I would want that if that was in the game!👍🏻
---
So much this. Every now and then I run into a total a-hole. Like earlier today some much higher level player was just whacking the crap out of me after I couldn’t run anymore. It was all I could do to dump a few items that were making me over encumbered so I could fast travel away. 
---
It wasn’t that big of a deal though. Especially when I ran into many others that were super friendly and a couple different people gave me gifts; healing items and such. I love to give back when I can but I run into far more people way higher than myself at only level 31 these days. 
---
I didn’t play for like three months and it’s nice to see people are still as friendly as they ever were before. Baseball season just made my life too busy to play with two boys playing on different teams.
---
Use that empath mutation. Works wonders.
---
Duping is as bad as using  castle glitching in r6s
---
It would make it even easier. The hassle of moving around the items is what keeps me from using mules.
---
I murdered someone but it let me revive them. As I fast traveled away they said, and I hadnt heard them talk before this point, "*what the hell was the point of that?*"
---
It would especially if you need to do it when the other player needs it asap.
---
It doesnt break xboxs terms of service
---
Did something similar recently. Sister and I launched her first nuke and I guess in her excitement, she hadn't stashed her newfound junk. So, she accidentally died while in the nuke zone and I'm like, no biggie. I grab her junk. I have more carry weight than her anyway so now she doesn't have to worry about being overencumbered.
---
Well my stupid ass *also* forgot to go stash it, because I ended up distracted by all those nice newly spawned glowing enemies. Between death and respawn was less than 20 seconds, but damn if the nearby players weren't just waiting or something. They snatched that shit up so fast. I felt so bad :(    I helped her go re-farm her stuff.
---
I would only use ammo smith when crafting so you can invest those two points into another category. Gunsmith is always really nice to have with heavy weapons, even when using LotD.
---
Also the same thing goes for perception, you could invest those 3 points into something like refractor or glowsight. Unless you value not having to equip and unequip those cards when you need to lockpick something, which is understandable because it can get a little annoying sometimes.
---
They do but almost no games had crossplay until sony decided to let fortnite have it. If what you're saying is true how did fortnite get crossplay?
---
So... you're finally awake
---
i thought about it, but i get damage from too many enemies at once to be able to tank a free 25% more damage, and him as a bloodied build can't really take it since the occasional straggler already kill him, that's especially true with big bosses that often cycle targets constantly
---
I think we're often over-critical of what we think up. Sometimes you just gotta go with your gut. E.G. my .50 cal machine gun is "Ma Deuce", my grenade MG is "Overkill", my quad double-barrel is "Boomstick", my super sledge is "Sledge Mammer" (a very old joke with one of my dad's friends), my handmade is "Kalash" (referencing Metro 2034), and my furious .50 sniper is named Simo (Haiya? After the most famout sniper of WWII). Sometimes you just have to come up with a name and stick with it until it grows on you, like my electrifid Chinese officer sword named "Kickstart."
---
Just follow the main quest for at least a couple locations. Then keep on with that or branch on the the many many side and misc quests to do.
---
True. Completely forgot about how bad it would be for you lol
---
I have but one updoot to give, please...take it... 
---
I'd plaster this all over my camp.
---
Neither did castle glitches or yaeger glitches but they got ip banned
---
I also basically copied captainoobs commando build after seeing that scorchbeast video
---
Also the more friends you have on your map, not just team mates, offer more free fast travel spots.
---
Another one is but i kinda like regular with limb damage better
---
Alright. Say you're working an office job, and you've got a stack of 100 papers you have to do. Your boss suddenly comes over to you with a problem, he says, "Hey Anon! I have a problem, it has to do with blah blah blah, and it's urgent." Your boss, Steve, then drops about 20 more papers onto your workload. These papers are now your priority, and every other week this happens. During these weeks you get all these minor papers worked out, but since you don't have all of them done, while still getting extra urgent papers, you get called lazy in the office. Word spreads around how you don't do any work and hardly ever finish reports, and even your boss calls you out on this.
---
maybe with that luck perk though? the one that reduces the negatives of any mutation. problem is i'm crap at math snd don't remember the numbers of this one, do you know if that would make it viable? also, does it always give me 25% more received damage even if i happen to play solo?
---
if user mods in fo4 and Skyrim are to be believed, a lot of qol improvements easy to implement.
---
From what I've read alot of mules have bought second accounts. But I'm sure mailboxes could increase mule usage depending on how they're implemented.
---
Yes, and that the issue with it. If you are fine with 8% more damage no matter what, go for it. But i dont think its worth it
---
 Its been like that since the game out. For some reason people do not study their junk when starting out.
---
 Did you know and un-battered clip board will give you a screw as well as a spring? ;)
---
Yeah and you may also get some progress by learning recipes on an alternate character.
---
Wheres the proof people actually got ip banned? And not just their accounts banned and they were speaking out the side of their neck like you?
---
Not really a nocturnal build, but I have rank 1 of Mr. Sandman and all weapons silenced.  Well except for the Dragon.  And the shotgun.  And the black powder pistol. 
---
But my main weapons are silenced.
---
Are you looking for the plans, or for someone to mod/craft?
---
No and I find the people that game the system with gimmick bullshit and duped builds they bought for IRL cash (maybe you didn't. I don't care what you say either way, but THEY definitely did) to be tedious morons with no lives that I wouldn't associate with if you paid me.
---
Can I retain all the plans I learned?
---
and you can still tame deathclaws and megasloths you just have to walk up to them the same way
---
i might tanl that little, and i could apply strange in numbers, but i see two more doubts at this point : would i have to share strange in numbers in order to give my friend the extra buff to empath? and would he still die in 1 hit with that less than 10% health bar anyway? anyway the input is great, thanks for bringing something to think about
---
Rifleman. It's not full auto until the 3-round burst degrades your weapon rapidly into a runaway gun &amp; you lose all your rounds.
---
Bethesda didnt even ip ban the guy they banned for life for using homophobic slurs. Its not a thing. They obviously cant do it or they would have done it there
---
.50cal or Gatling plamsa. They have very high dps with moderate ammo consumption.
---
Edited for grammatical errors: No need. You clearly ain't even  a* player who plays survival mode, you’re* a* adventure mode player. Survival Mode players* would already have a* camp that’s* meant to be in* survival mode.* Not* some "decorative" camp in some useless location.
---
Besides repetition of the word player/plays it’s getting closer to a cohesive statement. Cheers!
---
Unarmed and shotgun are my go to
---
Dolly Sods will spawn 1-2 Yao Gai on a regular basis.
---
Let’s be fair,  how about having them never drop lower than a 2*,  BUT it’s always leveled for you.
---
So you can’t get the mods my scraping then right ? Only drop from the event ?
---
Try "Phlblbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb!".
---
Two factor authentication. When you log in somewhere with your password, you’ll be prompted to confirm your identity using secondary means. Usually it’s getting a code by text message to enter, but it can be using a code generator app or other ways too. Basically it increases security by a lot using a small added step to logging in. Use it if it’s offered!
---
I'm sure that somehow explains why half the posts on this subreddit are complaints about bugs and features that these crybabies want Bethesda to make easier.
---
"Fast travel shouldn't be so expensive!"
---
"Deathclaw Hides can't be found en masse within an hour? BROKEN DROP TABLE"
---
"A rare challenge?  How can I be expected to complete 100% of a game that's expanding with every update?"
---
Daily challenges are imposible since camera went live.
---
Yes, except some ISP's use large scale NAT and some users don't have their own IPs any more.
---
You literally share with 100s of other people.
---
Its cheaper for the ISP than to pay for more IPv4 addresses.
---
True
---
Don't forget the longshoreman outfit and yellow slicker hat! I'm guessing that you didn't miss them but I'm just making sure. I like wearing that setup on my character that uses a pole hook as a main weapon. "Arr me matey, how be the fishin' fer legendaries treatin' ya?" I used to say as a greeting sometimes.
---
I love me a good ole fashion corpse hump.
---
Wait why are mechanics and perk cards that were clearly intended to be used together considered gimmicky? Is vanguard sent and END cards gimmicky then? What about Furious builds? 
---
I’m just struggling to understand why tailoring a character specifically for a gearset/playstyle is gimmicky just because it’s currently strong. It has tradeoffs and benefits just like any meta build. 
---
That’s like saying drifting in Mario kart with toad is gimmicky because it gives an advantage due to his character size? Or that arena armor in WoW is gimmicky because you had to earn it and spec for it?
---
I traded my way to my build which I feel pretty good about, and I wouldn’t want to associate with someone so narrow minded anyway.
---
Those scare the crap out of me.
---
Yeah that's the other part of the equation. I usually buy ammo from player vendors.
---
50 Lv Gusty
---
Exactly just because you make crazy statements and say prove without a doubt that its the opposite doesnt mean theres proof of your wild assertion. You have offered zero proof of anything you have said. ZERO
---
It is not about me not wanting to support bethesda, but they are changing challenges, to be impossible. That was not part of deal.
---
I tamed a Deathclaw yesterday.
---
Hell yeah that would work fantastically.
---
I’d rather go up against a Grafton monster any day over the Snallygaster. The two together are much worse though. Because that creepy monster(s) will sneak up on you as your ducking and moving around to avoid the Grafton. Lucky I had a friend around and it wasn’t nearly as bad as it could have been solo. Which I usually am solo.
---
I would prefer to have 1\* legendaries drop 1\* loot, with a slight chance at 2\*. 2\* loot should also be quest rewards.
---
Major bosses, the SBQ, ISS, etc., should drop 3\* loot, period. There should be no 3\* legendaries in the wild like we see now.
---
We do have the legendary vendor so...
---
Add a few more *worthwhile* legendary effects to the pool, but get rid of stupid crap like rolling pins. That way, the chances of getting something good &amp; serviceable are decent, but elite gear should be a challenge/dumb luck. As it should be. The + to this is if you want to farm 3\* gear, you at least know where to go and what to kill, and it would involve the community. I'm strictly a solo player but I like the event Scorched Earth--get together, kill together, then leave.
---
That’s not what we were discussing
---
Litterally every patch they fixes 60 bugs but noone seems to care
---
I’m sorry people are easy to exploit and sorry you somehow don’t have a ton of plastic lol
---
I’m super bummed.
---
I just got an anti-armor ultracite gatling laser from the purveyor.
---
Anti-armor still doesn’t work for energy weapons.  ;_;
---
I keep primed and non-primed versions of my favorite weapons, so I can use regular ammo and not have to make as much ultracite ammo.
---
This is exactly what it is. My made used to be right by there so I tracked it. It’s uranium fever glitch.
---
I knew. I’ve always been hunting them down.
---
Mine was the same. It had the tame and pacify options.
---
Good tip man gotta try it and put maybe dodgy on
---
All I will add is that if you use a pipe revolver and turn it into a rifle with mods you can stack rifleman and pistol perks on the same gun. I have a mutants explosive pipe revolver rifle that does just under 300 damage per shot.
---
Among the lowest I have seen. I personally go 7, 20, 30.
---
Me too... and the second one was a quad!
---
And don’t forget that the atom shop runs flawlessly ! They sure as hell don’t want to slow that 9- 14 dollar a skin money from trickling in.
---
Will it fix existing impossible items?
---
I think your pricing is fair, and very close to mine - 3 &amp; 7 respectively - 15 for super though. I made a post about this a few days ago, I'm just gonna copy &amp; paste it.
---
Anyone who recognizes my name knows I've been big into player vending since it started. Mostly plans, LOVE plans, but I'm mostly into honest vending. Even the best 3 star doesn't go for more than 2k, bulk and aid are plentiful and affordable, even the the plans I try to keep reasonably priced (I.E. Chem Bench was 2 caps.) Just encase a newbie came by.
---
Turns out there's a few disgruntled people out there. Thinking I'm killing the economy... and I'm just sitting here like, "?? Vendorbot limit reached, what chew want??" Some guy came into my camp yesterday and CLEANED 90 items out of my 3 vendors. Everything listed above.
---
Why? To sell it in his own vending for more. I mean, I got 15k caps out of it, so I'm happy, let alone a little over 250lbs of stash space - that makes me ecstatic!!
---
So thank you dude on XB1 who cleared me out. Your mouth and demeanor were fouler than mules rear, but I truly thank you from the bottom of my heart. You've allowed me to play for longer than 2 hours today!! Much love flippers, just please, stop being sad because some people don't value Chem Benches at 100 caps.
---
Excavator Armor + Lucky Hole Mines for me. I did a single run like a month ago and I *still* haven't run out of lead.
---
That would break the game
---
I go to west tek and Grafton steel for the steel. Kill the super mutants and loot their assault rifles scrap the for 18 steel each. For acid toxic larrys and server hop killing the three snallygasters then hopping. For lead as said above lucky hole mine but be sure to take excavator PA to double yields. Also use super duper and ammo Smith.
---
What do you consider a shithole?
---
 Lucky strike mine has tons of ore. The penitentiary and all the silos have weights that contain lead.
---
RPGs are not Mario Kart.
---
Metagaming is for losers in any RPG and always has been.
---
Also quick plug, i’m selling bulk and junks (except lead and screws since i’m also low in it. Don’t bother asking for ultracite(?) since i’m low leveled. Just 34.)
---
I can't remember the last time I used an app that \*didn't\* have the option to remember your password. It has nothing to do with laziness, its a common feature on virtually every application in modern society...
---
They recently nerfed Shotguns. The simplest answer is probably to either improve your build or improve your skill, whichever is easier.
---
Sure you didn't get the bladed mod plan?
---
It's amazing, man! Thanks for sharing.
---
Where i would get totally fucked over. I’m just level 34.
---
How would adding a new perk now be detrimental?
---
LOL alright dude, enjoy your blade of Bastet 😂😂😂
---
I like how you couldn’t refute my other points so you just glazed over them, thanks for that
---
I tried that with my PS4 and the iPhone app, screen too tiiiiiny :'(
---
I love people who try to flip my items for more it always lets me empty my 200+ pounds of extra excavator carry weight into my vendor. The only thing I try to price higher are GREAT 3* weapons. They are also the only thing I try to flip for more. I found a BE pump for 9k which I bought and promptly traded on the market for the side arm of my dreams BE 10mm SMG and a legacy tse laser rifle.
---
Yeah it does suck and I had an iPhone 5s back then. But I'm currently up to a Galaxy S10. I once had a 7 inch phone called the Huawei Mediapad X2. I loved it so much.
---
It's making me not want to play.
---
You figure out if it’s a lure?
---
My battery already doesn't last a whole day - it won't make it to breakfast if I get my hands on this.
---
Battery packs are the way to go. I carry one with me too work everyday.
---
I know that if you wait to do responder quest final departure you get a better somerset 44. I got a lvl 15 on my second character and i wish i would have waited till 25. That and pipe relover are your only friends for a long time.
---
Lots of agility for speedy, numerous vats attacks works for a while. Then i had to up my sneak. Getting tough now at lvl 28. O why didnt i wait for the better 44?😩
---
I've got 4 😂 I don't know how I lived without one before. I'm just not a fan of using while charging, and that's the only way I'd be able to do this 🤣
---
I think its fine. I've seen someone selling supers for 100 a piece before, which I thought was insane lol. 
---
I have that level 3 perk that helps you find more aid items (can't think of the name atm) so I'm usually drowning in them after a good hour or so of exploring. I sell them at 2, 5, and 15. (I figured most people who would buy them would be low leveled with low caps looking to replenish before going back on the road.)
---
One thing could be folks passing through to get to a new zone.  Lord knows I've done that plenty of times.
---
Woah. That’s HOT. Please don’t post stuff like this anymore - my underpants can’t handle this much strain
---
As someone from the UK who sees every game update at 4PM... Who cares, its just a game, ill just wait a few hours its not gonna kill me to not play for a bit
---
This, this right here. People fail to view it this way. I'd give you gold if I could.
---
Me in the wasteland : no fear
---
A wendigo in the wasteland 
---
Me: one fear
---
Eh, I make it up as I go.  And whatever strikes my fancy.
---
Xbox
---
I have a unique farming method that allows me to be swimming in stims in under 30 mins. Most of my customers are low-mid level
---
I believe you go into your photo gallery and there should be a set as profile picture option :)
---
Has the game improved since launch? sorry for the random question, I thought people have abandoned this game
---
Why didn’t you just leave the server???
---
And I was supposed to know that magically how?
---
Yep it is.
---
Wendigo has a nice creepy combination of being vaguely humanoid, but does not move like a human, is fast, is strong, screams.  
---
the feral ghouls of 4/76 are awesome as fast zombies. I was legit scared the first time one bolted at me and lunged toward me at full speed in 4.   
---
in 76, i think the scariest/creepiest  a tie between snallygaster and wendigo.  
---
I also think the Fog Crawlers are unsettling because they're so big  and can charge at you.
---
Im not sure if its greed or they just dont know how supply and demand work
---
Now see, that's how you play the trading game. I'm hoping to eventually trade myself to a legacy VE Plasma Gatling. Great find on that shotty!
---
Man, I wish. So far as I can tell enemies are not.aware of it on any level.
---
Almost killed myself by shooting that fence😂
---
that is sweet thanks
---
But where is the fun in that
---
Btw is it possible to get a legendary commie whacker from the vendor?  That would be a crazy roll
---
Oh yeah
---
Thanks for this. I was able to do the mods you suggested already without crafting guns to break down.
---
Excavator and 8 str gives about 540.
---
If its like fallout 4 with enough luck and some time you can get one
---
Dude rapid fires the buy button lol. I panicked and only thought to run to my stash and try to remove the serums but it was too late
---
If I found one of those I would start a new character just to use it.
---
That'd be great except when it runs out and you're over, how about just 1000 stash on all days that end with "y"?
---
im not seeing that just delete and hide ui
---
not recently, bit they had some several weeks ago
---
Don’t give any money ideas they may take you up on them !! Lol!!
---
nope
---
plans for the whacker do not exist. you got a plan for the bladed commie whacker mod
---
Hxfhhghgx
---
big yes
---
My level 5 Mirelurk died within like 1 day, level 16 Yao Guai lasted 3 days I think, level 30 Mirelurk King made it an entire week. I miss them all but I wasn't super attached to the level 5 Mirelurk, can't even remember their name. The Yao Guai was Fluffles and the Mirelurk King was Gil.
---
There’s sometimes one on the bed at the northernmost train station in the savage divide
---
Still one of my favorite threads on this forum
---
I could go on all day about what sort of deadly nasties that should be unleashed upon the wasteland.  
---
we can just go through [this and find all kinds of things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna_of_West_Virginia)

Mods are few hundred. He was obviously referring to plans.

How would the person know? And why would they specifically hold you up so they can buy all of this? Imagine trying to plan something like that out. "All right, you make sure this guy can't move, I'm gonna buy out his vending machines. That'll show him!"
---
After a sbq fight or impostor i sell out of all my stims and sometimes cherry nuka cola. Its like clockwork most of the time.
---
That’s close to my build.  I find bullet shield to be rather redundant to be honest.  Given how high your DR is already in PA, I barely notice any difference.    Like others said you can drop ammo Smith and out those points else where.   I can say that with PA you’re going to be over encumbered if you’re used to using a backpack.    I also wouldn’t waste pts on power user.  I have never ran out of power cores.   Might be better off going with batteries included depending on your weapon of choice.
---
I am more thinking of a Sheepsquatch esque pig or a super mutant behemoth. just a massive humanoid pig monster just squealing and smashing its giant fists in the ground
---
...what? The legendary weapon from the survival challenge? It's a harpoon gun. Exterminator, something something.
---
Weapon condition in this game is tied to hits for whatever reason. Two-shot makes weapons break faster. Explosive makes weapons break faster. Two-shot explosive makes weapons break exponentially faster. A two-shot explosive laser rifle with a beam splitter will last about 30 shots from 200% condition before it breaks.
---
He didn't say plans, and the mods are way easier to acquire/equip, so no, not obviously.
---
They accused me of having thpusands of nuka colas and serums, and I did, but these were all acquired by a duper dropping them. Besides, I dropped roughly 98% of all duped items the player gave me and they claim that they're, "TrYiNG tO rEMoVe AlL tHE iTEmS".
---
I apologize as I don’t wana distract from a very well put together video and example of soloing a difficult event.  It’s just something I noticed in the build portion of your post.  The video was excellent.
---
Oh. I thought it was a pistol. Iv been so focused on the quest. Whatever it is im close and i want it now after all this work. The bog is not nice to a 28 lvl
---
I picked a Vampire Gatling a few weeks back from a drop - totally wasn't spec'd for heavy at all. Easily the most fun gun I've had the pleasure of playing with - only thing that could top it would be explosive, if it were literal dream weapon + reloading damage resist... but that's beyond a long shot in the dark now. Suffice to say I invested 15 levels into perks so I can play with it somewhat correctly 😂
---
Ah yes, I understand now, thanks.
---
I don't like it either but it helps out. I have 6 battery packs and they are sometimes used for when I'm in the field doing military exercises for a few days.
---
That'd be great.
---
Where is that i don't see it.......[https://imgur.com/3tgY2us](https://imgur.com/3tgY2us)
---
That's awesome!
---
I know they were friends because the one who bought the weapon started pming me, haggling the price, after they both showed up together. They had already been there a few minutes going through all my machines, so if they had wanted the serums they would have bought them by the time we made the trade. While we were in the trade screen he started pming me about "look through my guns, see what you'd like to trade" so I did. But when I requested the ones I he just stood there without putting a price on anything. That's when the friend started buying out all my serums. After he bought them all he teabagged, did the "ok" emote then they both left.
---
&lt; They don't want more items on servers
---
double number of servers weekend too!
---
I mean, that would also be my response, so it's definitely not just you.
---
No problem.I think i got the sneak perk before Unyielding and didnt even think about that.
---
that’s super cheap
---
A bigger yes would be able to see what plans I haven’t learned.
---
I carry 3 different shotguns.

prison yard at the penitentiary
---
Next im gonna do it naked like West Tek yesterday.Did u watched that?
---
the biggest yes
---
I guess in retrospect *maybe* they thought they were being bros by buying everything and legit didn't know I was at max caps, but sheesh. It still screwed me out of 6k lol.
---
I don't make any build without Luck of The Draw Maxed out for this reason. I really like my explosive guns, especially heavy explosive guns - if SBQ lasts the full time I'm not worried about it 😉
---
Yeah I have the real bad habit I learned in FO3 was to run around mashing Vats to find enemies, and that's what lead to me noticing the drain effect.
---
Don’t take a workshop if you don’t want to be killed
---
just the old arrows, but those are very uncomfortable since you have to use your right hand, at that point it's easier to use the mouse.
---
one thing i can suggest tho is to use a mouse with a m3 that can allow both precise and free scroll, whenever i need to get to the bottom of my aid stuff i have to use free scroll, so i basicly just scroll once and let it roll until i'm where i need to be
---
sadly not working in the items section, z will try to place a camp and c will fav any item selected. you have to use the directional arrows, which is very very uncomfortable
---
I was joking, but would absolutely take more permanent stash space
---
Finally got it to work by traveling farther, thanks!
---
Tru7h. Thanks for serving 🙌
---
I saw a post about it but I didn’t watch the video.  Was that you?  This event Without unyielding armor Jesus that would be hard.  Not having 400 AP and OP sneak.
---
Yeah, yeah, you and just about everyone else were all "wrongfully banned" 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
last person driving it left the forks up causing a tripping hazard

😅 no prob. It's just another job with extra stuff to do. Rather be a civilian again.
---
You should be able to get a Ghoul mutation from radiation.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Oh man, please this be a thing.
---
I'd even settle for a simple "which faction do you want to join" type thing... ENCLAVE ALL THE WAY!
---
No gun durability perk is your problem.
---
The first ghouls appeared before we left the vault, theres a mission about them and notes saying how others were going to a play "for their kind" aka, underworld from Fallout 3
---
Yeah when the game was first getting details announced thats the first thing I hoped for when it came to mutations. My main playthrough on Fallout 4 I made a Ghoul General and united the Commonwealth with mods.
---
Or a specific quesline involving acuiring a certain genetic trait through genome editing  (I saw a video a long time ago that suggested that there is something genetic that allows ghouls to become ghouls) then standing in a nuke zone to permanently become a ghoul for that character.
---
Yeah, been doing  that. 3* under 500 caps have been great.
---
Interesting I never found that, well some surely would have stayed behind instead of leaving but I could see them leaving that lore on purpose as a reason you don't see any ghoul bodies.
---
How much longer are you planning on staying in? Just another job, or fighting a good fight - both are worthy of appreciation in my book 🙃
---
I didn't ask for tariffs
---
That would certainly be better then what we currently have where we just wildly throw suggestions to the wind and hope the the reasonable people who use this sub get to your post before the salty sea dogs who downvote everything do
---
A mission where you could chose to get dunked in FEV and become super mutant would be cool also. Then people could have there mutant groups running around.
---
But the hardcores are going to do what they're going to do anyways
---
Yeah maybe, but if you look at a lot of the corpses, even the "fresh" corpses they look like theyre in the early stages of ghoulification, just not full on like we see in the games set later
---
We're roughly 27000 employees
---
I only just figured this out! I've always made grenades a part of my game. I finally got the quantum plans and was underwhelmed. I'll just sell them all and go back to Nukas for now until/unless they fix it.
---
Love it.

You really need to pick one playstyle. Melee or rifleman, etc. Hybrid builds dont do well in FO76. That is not to say you cannot melee as a rifleman, or pick up a gun as a melee, you just aren't going to invest the perk points into the secondary damage type. 
---
They play completely differently, and have different setups.
---
Kinda funny how the person is wearing a responder jumpsuit, the responders have a communist mindset
---
Would love a complete quest-line for being a ghoul and what they have to go through venturing the wastes. 
---
Could make for an entirely new S.P.E.C.I.A.L card perk layout and completely change how the game is played PVE or PVE. 
---
I'm not saying it should be elder scrolls and start adding in all sorts of races to choose from, with special abilities and such. But it would be really badass to play from a ghouls perspective and their life outside of the vault enduring the nuke blast un-sheltered and all the fallout afterwards. 
---
Could even add in a new ghoul underworld like Fo3 that would both add in a new questline for humans as well as an entirely new story for playing a ghoul character.
---
Two shot is too inaccurate in distances and AA increases damage more in higher DR enemies.
---
Are you planning on going bloodied? Different perk layout for bloodied vs. non-bloodied.
---
As have you, so how about we just agree to disagree
---
They should bring back the R91 as a burst rifle
---
Holy shot we were just talking about the Chinese Cultural Revolution in class and I recognized the stance right away
---
the icon is always a pistol, but the weapon is different each time
---
Oh yeah, mutants would be better than aiming. Although aiming damage seems to work from hip now, but that is a bug.
---
Two shot is too inaccurate in distances. It's great in CQB but after 20 meters it's just spray and pray.
---
Now why would I lie about something like that? I have 3 screens, most of the time 2 of screens have chrome open and main screen usually has 40+ tabs open while the second screen has 20+ open 
---
I find it curious that you necro a 166 days old post and blatantly claim that I'm lying... What are you, 12 years old? 😳
---
20 meters is 21.87 yards
---
Yeah, but the plans don’t seem to drop. Neither do the lever actions themselves very often (I’ve actually found more legendary versions than ordinary ones) so buying the plans to make lots to break down is the only real way to learn the mods. Consider it an investment for a great rifle.
---
As long as I can make bacon out of it.  😉
---
I am planning on bloodied yes
---
Yeah it was me.And perception is also bad,instead of 1bullet u need 5 because 4misses the target 😀.Anyways im gonna do it when i have free time.
---
You were the one say they should do this or that. You can change your IP address and no proof they can do anything other than what they are doing. Work arounds to all your solutions. My answer is they need to fix their game
---
Hmmm, the mouse then?  That will work.
---
Yay pulse rifles!
---
Poor guy in #3 looks like he was stood up.
---
No, just what person has 40+ tabs open, the hell are you doing.
---
True I don't use two shot anymore for that reason.
---
Hopefully until next year. I have to cut off strings that are attached to me one at a time. I'm stuck working with radios and communication security. I was trained in AIT (soldier school after boot camp) on network communications but all of it was thrown out when I got to my unit. Did two deployments where I sit in a shelter that sits on the back end of a big truck. I practically sat, drew, ate, slept, and kinda lived at my workstation for most of my deployments. I also have to pick up the slack for others at times and at times others are willing to let me relax and do my job. I even trained my superiors and learned how to do their job so that I didn't have to bother them as much. That way we can sleep and not have issues.
---
But yeah the army is kinda hard but you get used to it.
---
Thank you but it's different from my point of view. 🤷
---
lol\^\^
---
I like this idea better.
---
I had someone actually show up in the missile silo with me when I dropped one last week
---
If it wouldn't be, i definitely wouldn't spend that time and effort trying to get a fix. Yes. There are a lots of frustratiing bugs and issues. But this game still has also good things. Like a huge beautiful world that gives you a freedom you barely find in other games.
---
lol uhh... i don't know, i research stuff.. i leave tabs open i don't forget to check stuff later etc...
---
I'm far from low level but if you have deep pocketed for a combat armor and trapper arms I would visit your shop

If you’re on Xbox I can unload a few dozen cores for you. My stash is full, and this way you can VATS for days.

There is a corpse flower event on the upper left corner east of aaronholt farm.

Could you make a vid on how to set this all up?
---
I remember the last few installments of FOnline sessions had a trait during character creation that let you start as a super mutant. It was permanent, took up a trait slot, slowed your animations down, and restricted the armor/weapons you could use. In exchange, you got higher resistances, more health, and got to be a super mutant.
---
Those kinds of changes might be a bit much for this game, but the great thing about it is that we already have the groundwork for much smaller changes. Mutants in this game are not restricted to the slow crawling pace they had in F1/2. They can use rifles without issue. Fallout 4 already had super mutant armor, they could introduce that same mechanic of higher base DR/damage mitigation at the cost of only having crappy, heavy mutant armor available. Same thing with ghouls, non-feral ones have pretty much just been humans with less hair and different textured skin since fallout 3. Considering we are nuking Appalachia on a daily basis to fight a dragon-bat, it wouldn't be far-fetched to develop a ghoulification mutation
---
Gonna be playing my melee again soon, gotta level her up since she's only like level 37 I think but I have an Anti Armor Shishkebab with Swing Speed and Reduced Weight, which is the main reason I want to play her again.
---
The event death blossoms gives you a ton
---
Rule of thumb: standard should be about four times what you're charging for a diluted one, and super should be slightly more than that.
---
Reasoning: You can turn one regular stimpak into 4 diluted stimpaks (assuming you have the Chemist perk), so if you're selling regulars at less than four times what you're asking for diluted ones, I'm not buying your diluted stimpaks. 
---
So you might want to lower what you're asking for the diluted stimpaks or increase the price for regulars.
---
Yo I play with a Gatling laser.

It'll get easier. Plus this community is pretty good about answering questions and being helpful.

Hooray! Many a time I've walked by those and wondered WHY NOT?

The mutants there learned of my anger the hard way.
---
Test the game. Fix the game
---
Cool idea, but no. The one thing that sets ghouls apart from humans is their immunity to radiation (and actually getting healed by it), so playing as a legit ghoul would trivialize nuke zones.

---
I wouldn't waste your time with any Two Shot shotgun, the ridiculously high increased spread and essential inability to use it in VATS beyond 2 feet makes them absolutely garbage. Even before Two Shot got nerfed, that effect on shotguns was awful because all that bonus damage is added to A SINGLE PELLET, which if it missed along with half of the rest of your pellets actually results in significantly reduced damage in practice and Skeet Shooter 3 doesn't really help much. 
---
If your looking for a Double Barrel specifically try and get a Quad Explosive one, for the pump, probably Anti-Armor Explosive, and the Combat Furious Explosive.
---
I saw that before. It might be possible but you also have to remember that the graphics on Fallout 76 is updated slightly more than Fallout 4. I know they look almost alike but the system that they worked around with is a newer version to add new features and you can't make it low quality like Fallout 4. We need something like the Nintendo switch's capabilities as you can see in many of the games that are played on it. The switch is also cheaper. Don't know why Bethesda didn't go with that choice like they did with Skyrim and Doom.
---
No prob
---
500daily, 1500weekly.
---
Yeah I mean it would just be a cosmetic thing, you could skill yourself up to be super rad resistant if you wanted that to be part of rping a ghoul. Otherwise if it was a buff that would be pay to win and no thanks on any more of that crap.
---
A good old smack to the head with a mini nuke should set him straight
---
Or just allow us to bulk ammo for sale...
---
I'm reluctant on the ideas of surveys. They can be setup to give you the answer that you'd prefer to hear than what the community actually wants.
---
For instance, given how Bethesda has handled the situation with Repair Kit, feedback was VERY clear that they were wanted but not to be sold on the Atom Store. They said they listened to and appreciated the feedback but did what they wanted anyhow. 
---
Do you think a survey would have changed that outcome? Even more so if they geared the survey to be biased towards Repair Kits on the Atom Store and no option for open feedback.
---
They have the sub and community managers to filter through the feedback. They're not missing our feedback, at least the popular ones.
---
Kids these days are too soft. They succumbed to a slightest crack...in game 🙄
---
I changed mine the day they allowed it, no issues here from 76.
---
 And that a Carlyle Typewriter has 2 screws?
---
I'm guessing you read it, people will pay top caps for that plan, along with most of the other Arktos ones (as they are absurdly rare, I for example have probably ran the event 20+ times and don't have a single new plan from it...)
---
Right? Those things have the radius of a fat man. They are insane. As a grenade build, I was super excited this is how it turned out: common mats grenade is amazing, rare mats grenade is worthless. I’ll drink the quantums and make grenades out of the regular nukas all day.
---
I play as a junk merchant who only uses shotguns and doesn’t wear clothes. So far I’ve made it to level 58 with just a pump shotgun and no clothes at all.  The shotgun perks are very strong and very satisfying, the pump shotgun can do a fuckload of damage and with the enforcer (I think) perk its very easy to cripple limbs which is really important. Similarly you can carefully pick perks that give you a shitload of DR so long as you are not in power armor. So for example today I was at Whitesprings and a level 92 *** legendary glowing death claw came out of nowhere and while each shell only took a tiny bit of health away, it only took one shell to each leg to cripple it so I could easily outrun it and then just keep dumping shells into it. Took almost 200 shells to kill it but I got a one star wood leg. Thanks Bethesda.
---
But then all 6 hit the same enemy. So stronk.
---
What about double vodka, is that good suggestion?
---
No I'm pretty sure there aren't any. If you're having problems you could always launch the nuke yourself. It's a pain in the ass but if you need the flux that badly then it'd be worth the grind.
---
Exact reason why i only have one character :/
---
I know more people that use nuka grenades than lever rifles. 
---
It’s me. I’m the only person I know personally that plays, and I use grenades and not lever rifles. Pls fix the grenades Beth. 
---
I’m not terribly disappointed because the regular nukas are so good. I don’t even have to worry about whether to use the quantums as aid or grenades. Makes the choice easy.
---
I see. Well that's a disappointment. Thought i was getting a new weapon for my pistol guy. Thx for the heads up.
---
Oh ok
---
More than fair
---
I saved up a bunch and took them to my first SBQ fight. I had never use them before, so I was excited to bring out the real power. Laughed maniacally as I rained them down... then deflated like a cartoon balloon. So pathetic.
---
What system do u play on? On xbox i cant seem to find a server that hasnt launched a nuke.
---
Yup. I pretty much only craft stuff and do legendary runs but won't do the buggy events or use the legendary  vendor is out until they fix the *** bug.
---
I never got one so I can’t try it.
---
I only have 5 in charisma.  4 for lone wanderer and 1 for travel agent.
---
No need my good sir. America works for democracy.
---
Apparently they patched it. It was just a 3 star weapon with a mod that gave it another star like the sacrificial blade on the machete
---
There should be a way to stop this from being posted every single day here.
---
My favorite is when you cripple gulpers and they flip over and scoot around on the ground on their back.
---
Thiccccc
---
Yeah sorry but enemies floating while not moving isnt as big of a deal as everyone having bloodied explosive handmades
---
Awesome 👍
---
Oh they'll add it. But then you won't have enough budget 😢
---
"Hey Bud. can i borrow your wire cutters? some guy is selling ammo for 3% of a cap per bullet, its a bargain and a half"
---
I got a few clicks to sell I'm on ps4
---
 I used Hunting Rifles for 50 levels. Now I don't because I find the Lever Action, especially my Instigating one, a better sniper. Its better for many reason bur mainly because I can follow up with another bullet before it moves, if it survived the first. That is golden for a sniper.
---
Ok again that wasn’t what was being discussed
---
I got on my camp if youre on PC.

Mole rats traveling at light speed when underground.
---
I legit get jealous when I walk into prefab houses and see cabinets, refrigerators and sinks. I just don’t understand why we can’t build them, they’re already in the game. Just like the nukaworld arcade games, they’re in 76 they just don’t work. Like if they’re reusing assets wouldn’t it have taken more work to make them non functional lol. Maybe I’m just an idiot but that’s how I see it anyway.
---
What platform you on I'm interested
---
It wouldn't be so bad if we could set the price with a key pad instead of that atrocious slider.
---
Just don't buy atoms till they fix them.

Ghouls that are laying on ground and floats around insta killing you. Normally a bug like that would be annoying but it's hilarious. Filmed couple epic videos thanks to that clitch

 I gave a mod list in the front. Its fairly obvious what to do to it. All I'm trying to do is convince you to try it further, as it is a better gun.
---
I've seen him at Berkeley Springs and a couple times on the greens at White Springs, if anyone is still hunting.
---
Cheers mate
---
I do use the lever action wtf are you talking about
---
Nah, you right. Server stability has been ongoing issue since launch. The more they add the more millions of players plug into their camp as permanent objects to account for. They do keep adding more and even expanded the budget and shrunk budget costs for turrets. So it looks like they are headed that direction, but gonna take a little bit longer.
---
Bear arm, same as sheepsquatch weapons, can't be legendary, so it is trash anyway.

 You said you had not fallen in love with it. I found that a bit strange.

---
Everytime I'm on there's at least one nuke on my server and 9/10 it's whitespring. So you're not gonna have any luck getting violet there. If I had more enthusiasm for queen fights these days I'd rock the nukes all day. But with the poor loot table and extensive setup I get bored of it. But whitespring isn't really that much better. 😂
---
 "but so far I haven’t fallen in love."
---
Where did I say that?
---
I hear ya
---
Unfortunately no
---
I swear they used to bigger then a couple weeks ago it changed.  I used to use quantum and nuka and both were good.  Now only nuka is good.
---
Just keep swimming.

Ps4 same mate

Thanks mate
---
Dood... Nobody buys .38 ammo.. That shits the most common and free! Ammo in the game... Why would anyone pay .01 caps for it? Give it away cause aint nobody gonna buy it. I have it for 0 caps in my machine and couldnt even give it away. Just gonna drop it in one of the whitesprings shop cash registers.
---
This is probably the most annoying bug currently. If your game crash/server disconnects you have to face terrible consequences. Quests will broke permanently for that character, you loose stuff, CAMP gets deleted, you loose game process and some quests you had active will mark as completed without getting the rewards or next quest.
---
I’m trying to be patient but I want a sink damnit!
---
They had forums on BethNet for Fallout 4. I'd imagine it's the same for 76.
---
Sadly I did that for an hour and still bugged :/
---
 LOL. 3 sneak makes you a sneak build. One bit of Chameleon armor and you can get damn close. I use Combat Knives myself, but I can do West Tek with my Lever Action.
---
You know I've seen a lot of camps installed on prefab cabins. They're really fancy. Even got doors on then. All cleaned up the best they can. Extra bldg to the side for crafting bench's. Very neat.
---
I couldn't do it with 4 base char, I allocated another 2 perk points for a total of 6 base (I have like 20 something cause of unyielding armor) and I could finally tame the claw.
---
So in my experience 5-6 char is required to tame a deathclaw. 4 Charisma failed on 3 separate tamable deathclaw encounters until I bit the bullet and levelled char.
---
The ghoul sleepers that just float along the ground at WS is ridiculous. I don't even get angry when they sneak up on me and kill me outta nowhere
---
Did you actually just make up words for me or are you deeply confused?
---
If its the normal typewriter, it has 2 correct?
---
Will try, although a significant portion of my base was missing so I suspect a large supermutant raid or something that the people buying from my vendors were not friendly enough to clear up.
---
Way to go!
---
Well, I try to be polite.
---
There's the huge price difference between mods and plans. Oh and it's systematic. Prices are same everywhere and mods are always way much cheaper than plans. And then there's the small fact that foreing WS bots don't have any mods.
---
So it's very obvious.
---
Maybe they'll fix it if you lie and say it duplicated all of your legendaries. lol! Sorry for your loss.
---
I’ve tried that several times but also comparing to 4, you can’t delete preexisting objects like the tables, chairs, and trash so it’s not organized enough. I like the “scrappy look” so I’m not trying to make fancy mansions but I draw the line on having my house filled with trash lol. Apocalypse or not I’m cleaning my house and floating trash chairs ain’t on my list of camp decor that I want haha.
---
Ghoul mutation: Changes your outlook, radiation has now separate bar and doesn't decrease HP and inteead regens it. The more rads the faster HP regen and increased strength but also lowers intelligence (becoming more and more feral). I'd love that!
---
 My mistake, I thought you were the OP. Why would I care whether you think I am one topic when you are just another commenter. 
---
 Anyway I'm trying to keep people informed, so they make good choices.
---
5. I'm fairly sure that this never worked, at least since I got Super Duper. Would have been a pretty obvious exploit: You could make plastic by bulking and scrapping.
---
8. I imagine you're just more likely to remember when you die from a big hit than when you don't. As far as I know, enemies never use the crit mechanics (otherwise I'd die a lot more, playing bloodied). All Sentinel pieces work together on a hit, so with a full set you'll either have 75% damage reduction or none at all. If you're squishy without Sentinel then you'll be randomly squishy with it.
---
You still need the gun. Suggest 3\* "90% reduced weight" pistol with all mods taken off. My 10mm weighs 0.3lb.

Go for 50 cal or gatling. LMG packs some serious dps but it cost waaaay too much to shoot. Went from 20k caps to broke ass vault dweller after a week of usage. Fair balancing. Grenade launcher is not viable. Breaks too fast
---
Bulk ammo could be a good solution.
---
How about an eye roll emote?
---
 Would of been perfect when this one dude kept dancing around me with his power fist while I was trying to put stuff in my vending machine. I just gave him the thumbs down emote, unplugged my vendor and locked my doors.
---
That's correct.
---
 About what, which is the better gun? No I'm not.
---
Hi, I was banned a while back for duping.
---
 Im not disputing it,  I knew it was an exploit and paid the price for it.
---
I'm just wondering if I'm banned from all bethesda games or just fo76, I dont want to go out and buy a game if I cant play it.
---
my psn is MickizM 
---
Any info would be appreciated, thanks
---
You’re commenting irrelevant information to incorrect people. Stay on topic or start a new comment thread.
---
Obviously that’s not what I meant.
---
I tried a one star 2 shot and a one star AA and found the AA to be underwhelming. Maybe I'll try it again.
---
I have always wanted to play a Ghoul in a Fallout game.
---
😂 so true
---
I've had this every time I log out. Assumed it was intentional lol.
---
This is why I always run with the perk that slows weapon degradation by 50%.
---
One thing I’d love to see them do in this game for the long term would be a “post” server.
---
Only accessible by characters that have finished a SB Queen fight. Changes to the map could include settled npc vault 76 dwellers, ghouls, friendly super Mutants and others from outside Appalachia.
---
Killamanjaro!
---
 No just one. As you have not studied your junk well you did not know that a tin can has 1 Lead.
---
 I'm mostly joking, but really knowing what everything has, makes intelligent looting possible.
---
Ticks
---
 I am on topic. You are the one that strayed. WTF is an incorrect person.
---
Like I know WHY we can’t but that doesn’t mean I’m any happier about it lol.
---
Bravo! Well done lol. There's a perk for crippling for shotguns did that help you fight 3 at a time? Idk how I'd feel with 3 of em on the ground 😳
---
You literally replied to the *wrong person* talking about something that wasn’t being discussed. Stop defending yourself you should’ve just said sorry I made a mistake and moved on.
---
This is raising multiple questions I'm not sure I want answered
---
Only if you don't participate, I've heard.
---
All I got were seeds. :/
---
Honestly wtf you know exactly what I mean be “the incorrect people” you literally thought you were talking to somebody else.
---
Hard to say. Probably either scorchbeasts that fly partially trapped in the ground or giraffe necked mongrels
---
When you are in the game, in a world, open menu with ESC or by opening map and then pressing Z, and go to photo gallery from there, not through main menu. When you do that there's option to make profile photo for your current character you are playing in that world.
---
I don’t think i have seen a carlyle typewriter yet. Usually, when i see a junk that has importance, (i.e copper, gold, silver, aluminum and etc.) i scrap them, but things such as glass, leather and plastic, i just straight up sell them to the station vendors or whoever.
---
That would be amazing
---
The first time you shoot one out of the air is cathartic. After that they just annoy. 
---
I do recall when I learned you could dodge the sonic attacks.
---
But, there are plenty of Commie Whackers at the Tyler County Fairgrounds you can pick up.
---
Only because you acted like it was your thread. I should have paid more attention, but I answered his fucking question.
---
 Still you have a point.
---
Another plug, i’m selling bulked junk cause i have a lot and poor in caps right now. Xbox GT is the same as my username.
---
500 seems ok for a purely weekend boost. If they started a double or X exp boost in weekend. 
---
Not by itself though.
---
I'm level 181 now but I still vividly remember the first time I said to myself "I'm not running this time Fartbat!"
---
Welcome to endgame.
---
Oh, so that's what Freddy Krueger's wife looks like...
---
I got a quad, +25% fire, faster movement speed one with the auto piston barrel. With those 40 spikes in the mag, I can anhiliate about just everything. The auto reciever benefits from commando, right?
---
\&gt; and if no one else launches them I do 
---
and that is how we got appalachia to its current state.
---
No you did not. You asked for a minimum wage hike.
---
 That's just wrong. "Wrong" is the word you are looking for. Incorrect is not really the same thing.
---
I didn’t act like it was my thread I just replied to someone to provide clarity. Op appears blue on their posts.
---
I have a Nocturnal 3* laser gatling. It's a frigging beast. At night. During the day it's not BAD, but I'd rather use my exploding 50cal during the day.
---
That is incorrect.
---
Console Master Race
---
 I know and I was careless.
---
That's so crazy. Maybe it's because you put it in the stash? I've been disconnected in the middle of flora farming too but I've always been able to come back and it be good still.
---
And that’s fine. Just move on now...
---
The guy was just trolling like you said. Most people I see selling on Xbox is 30-50 caps for normal stims. If I ever see them at 10-15 I buy all they have.
---
What?  man, give that grenade another try.  use them all the time and they work wonderfully against mobs.
---
There is a special place in hell for Cabin Campers!
---
 No that's right. Nearly always in the English language the shorter the word, the less connotations it has. Using incorrect instead of wrong is just one of those cases.
---
I've got rank 2 of action boy and rank 4 of lone wanderer.  My AP refreshes quite quickly.
---
Nope. Got that one long before I did my first Nuke launch. Was afraid she was dead, but then she came back to scold me for launching Nukes.
---
Sure allow, but then make design so that having an alt doesn't boost you economically. It is stupid how game currently forces you to make alts, just so that you can bypass those limits- scrip, money, inventory. This game should be about playing with one character. I get why in WoW you have alt option or in Destiny 2 or in ESO, but here having an alt is pure bs and just economical boost.
---
 After you. I am nothing if not polite. ;)
---
I’m not arguing semantics with you. You knew what I meant and I have no idea what you think you’re going to get out of disputing this
---
i dont think we'll be seeing any fixes till after e3. its somewhat frustrating. theyve been great about adding new content but bug fixes are coming way too slow. i bought a couple copies for friends about three weeks ago, but the amount of problems theyve encountered has already made them quit. Ive got a lot more patience. but one thing that keeps popping up in my head is that bethesda doesnt fix bugs. i hate to bring up fallout 4 but the fact that identical bugs exist in both games is very worrying. some people cant even play arktos on console and its been weeks. free range has to be the worst quest ive ever ran, with the brahmin just straight up stopping for minutes at a time. everytime ive tried to tell my friends its time to get back into it they encounter a ton of buggy bs and the hiatus continues. i understand the need to fix exploits and add content i really do, but at this point bug fixes are becoming less and less. if the game cant be made more playable then all the content in the world is irrelevant.
---
these duplication exploits are truly starting to get annoying. and duplication bs seems to be the only thing getting attention paid to it. though for this one i blame the dupers. bethesda at the very least are making sure they cant break the game further. more and more though i find myself logging in and asking why? why bother. all the stuff i want to do is made very irritating because of bugs. i used to be a builder, but the last camp update ruined everything. they trashed camps so that things could "float". well thats good for the people that love their bases to look terrible and not be immersive. thats great for them but why break it for those of us that like our houses to be on the ground?? I dont like to be too salty. the game has a ton of redeeming qualities, the community being one of the best. that keeps me coming back and logging on. I just dont understand why bug fixes are so low on the totem pole. new players will not change their opinion of the game no matter how much new content is added if its all broken content. Lots of people heard arktos was great. lots of people cant even get in to play. so whats the point of hooking them in with new content just to drive them away with bugs??
---
Anyways, nothing really useful in my post i just needed to vent i guess. love the game, love the c.a.m.p. i tolerate the bugs, but am gettting annoyed. dupers have to be the most selfish people in gaming, aside from game investors maybe. I wish we could see more dedication to bugs. I cant imagine how difficult it must be though to pump out new content with as fast as we eat it up, while simultaneously trying to patch bugs and keep up with exploiters. so i think that should be noted. expectations definitely need to be managed from time to time. i just truly hope we arent waiting till july for bug fixes.
---
I got a 1 star unyielding wooden leg from the queen today :)
---
Sure
---
Pretty Please with a cherry on top!
---
Me too. Why read them...when eventually,,,maybe(?) I can display them. Such artwork. Much wow. Versus...non breaking lock picks or 10%damage to robots.
---
mine was the camara glitch it was usefull as hell with the instant teleport.
---
I just had a customer pop into my camp, he didn’t buy anything but he jumped around with me while I was in underwear and armor. The he dropped a marsupial serum on the ground for me and left. Dude was a badass.
---
Here’s a quick vats pistol build I just made up, seems like a good idea with a vanguard setup.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=33f35de&amp;d=ad2ak2al2lv2lk2lt2l12l71a72a00ic4cu2ee2eg1ej4eo2ea0pb2sv2&amp;w=&amp;n=Theorycraft%20pistol&amp;m=5cf1
---
Lol in a genuine way.
---
Placeable junk why? Because clutter 👏👏👏👏 I still don't get why we can't place junk. Bethesda uses it for NPCs and yet...we don't get to use it? 🤔
---
That's good to know.  I was considering making a few of those.
---
To be fair I was mostly being sarcastic...but not really. At that level it’s like wow so cool must be rare.
---
I was like like level 47 and I bought the ritual mask from some for like 300 caps,,.so it happens to the best of us. Legit never found it until I looked it up and went searching.
---
I called someone out for standing around while I started a power plant a few days ago. I was surprised that they just left. If they hadn’t, I would have dropped it and moved on so they got nothing unless they did it themselves.
---
what a great, sleazy idea!  I have one machine that I load up with 30 marine tactical helmets for 5 caps a piece for people to buy and sell to robot vendors.(gets cleaned out quite often)  might have to try that as a joke.
---
I got mouse with burst fire mode.. using it with my 10mm sub
---
Sheepsquatch flying into oblivion. Every time.
---
Don’t the snallygasters in the project paradise count as encryptids? If so just go there and it’s easy
---
Yep they can be anywhere in the waste land I managed to finish it two days ago I got the last two without even knowing I had them.
---
Today was the first time it ever did that to me. Stashing was always the safety measure before.
---
Jeremiah Johnson Nod of Approval
---
Well on the bright side, you can get scrip for them at least.
---
Played like a fiddle, love it.
---
I miss Eve. Running around WH space with a cloaky Loki was so much fun. Or sitting off of lowsec stations in a arty cynabal plinking people was a blast. But that’s way too much work now.
---
Lol, like literally? Or is that a Nemo joke haha
---
I would disagree for a few reasons. Excavator armor is superior to any other power armor because it allows me to free up at least 3 perk points in str or agility by letting me swap out weight reduction perks that I would be forced to use in any other power armor.
---
What do I gain from the "better" power armors? A tiny bit more defensive stats, which in most cases are meaningless because I'm not going to be saved from death by 15 more points of armor(less than 5% difference) in most cases. But I damn sure will benefit from swapping out a perk like traveling pharmacy and putting in a 20% dmg card like slugger or heavy weapons.
---
And lastly I see no benefit to having any torso mod besides emergency protocols or auto stim, which can done on excavator.
---
Bite your tongue sir!  I'll have you know my omlettes and hashbrowns are to die for!!
---
This build will allow a high vats shot ratio with crits and refill potential, and some defensive boosts while prioritizing higher HP and AP.  This build doesn’t allow power armor for the full effect. Drug usage is a go, so psycho, x cel, and all the fun toys can be brought out to play for even larger potentials dps and damage resistance.
---
They used to load in like that fairly often, especially the pre-placed corpses in spots like the Wixon homestead bedroom next to poor Cheswick. Noticed the clothing bug isn't as common lately, which is nice.
---
Never would have guessed they were hiding curves like that under all the violent, genocidal rage, though.
---
Yeah hahahaha. But seriously you just have to keep trying. Sometimes it takes for ever lol
---
Good stuff
---
The T-posing enemies are always a treat, I really don't mind that one so much. Otherwise, it's when certain doors don't actually play their opening animation, they just ***snap*** open when the animation was supposed to finish. Like the service entrance at the Whitespring bunker.
---
But destroying my camp is bullying and it hurts my feelings. We're supposed to rebuild the wasteland, not destroy it. 
---
Ban PVP all together, in fact ban all others players so I can play safely by myself, where others can't play how they want because it offends me. 
---
You're all evil and sadistic bullies who live in your parents basement, or trailer. You probably all voted for drumpf too - no wonder you want to build walls, loot and pillage! 
---
Bear with me while I check pacifist mode is still on.......phew it is! Didn't want to accidentally shoot back and cause pvp, as my precious crappy, empty, standard camp that takes twenty seconds to rebuild, might be destroyed!!! :-)
---
I had to pull a bunch of ticks off of my granny’s dogs the other day. I’m thoroughly disgusted by them now. Even the ones in-game make me start itching.
---
The wiki says 25, is it wrong?
---
Haha! Alright thanks I appreciate it
---
Yes, they do, but that is not what this post is for, clearly. The Snallygaster is 1 of 9 needed and as you mentioned are pretty common to find. The flatwoods and “alien” have not been so easy for most to track down, hence my post. 😉
---
Ok sorry thanks for the clarification
---
yes but if you look pick you will be wanted and then he can just kill you, not a griefer but diffently he was trying to trick ppl into pvp.
---
Well done! I'm hoping I can get to that stage but my level 41  is still in "run away for my life mode or I'll die mode when I hear the wings anywhere. I don't trust my weapons yet. 😂
---
Either you moved your camp, your generators died(won't show shop on map) or you got bad DC'd.  Could have been an update as well that reset vending?  I had it happen once when I moved my camp 6 ft.
---
In this day and age, I'm not sure I'd put it past anybody. I'm likely just paranoid but why open the breech when it's so unnecessary? Its a password, its supposed to be important. My time is worth something. If a simple slip such as leaving it open were to cost me all I've worked towards in this game? Done. Just isn't worth it IMO to save a few keystrokes,
---
Gold!!! Because yes, this would be at the entrance to my camp. Great work!
---
I agree!!
---
I wonder if it had anything to do with the maintenance today then
---
If your'e going to lock away your vending machine or hide it, forget you... I'm not wasting my time, I'm moving on and it's your loss. This still makes 0 sense to me. Who the hell wants to waste their time and make that effort to access someone's vending machine?. Honestly, if it is some sort of ploy, who the hell would fall for it?.
---
Could ya be Epic and make one for Vault-Tek? We ARE the reason you vault dwellers are still alive ya know?
---
Reminds me of my first scorchbeast kill! I was stuck in the old bug where you were in a broken power armor frame with no benefits/parts but also couldn't leave. Because of the lack of benefits, I was also encumbered to the point where I could only crawl. As soon as I log in, and mind you this is in the ash heap when I'm still like level 20 or 30 something, a scorchbeast attacks me. I'm overencumbered due to a huge looting spree, so my gear is pretty close to destroyed. My combat rifle breaks, my pistols break, my 10mm smg runs out of ammo, I'm left looting the scorched for anything I can use to finish it off. I imagine you must have felt the same glory if not greater after taking out three

27,000 IT employees performing server upgrades at 130 am? No, like I said, you or a handful of IT employees at most.
---
Anothing thing I can recommend is going to your junk tab and pressing the button that sepperares the types of junk and marking the types you need. From then on, every time you look at junk that has that material, a little magnifying glass will pop up.
---
whiteSpring floor crawling ghouls moving so fast Bots can't keep up, robots all die but keep spawning. Rinse and repeat
---
im with you on this one, if your stuff is lock or hard to find. Im out, your loss my gain that simple.
---
For two straight nights I’ve been baffled trying to figure out where my 9 cores went. Friggin VATS. It all makes sense now. Infuriating sense. 
---
Thanks OP, for the enlightenment.
---
The world around me deciding it no longer feels like loading in, so I'm walking through the wasteland one moment and falling into the abyss the next. Eventually I die, meaning there's a ~50% chance that if I try to respawn the game will crash and I will lose my junk
---
A save password feature is like the most standard shit and it's super easy to implement, probably just got overlooked. Literally almost any developer will tell you feedback like this is a good thing. Small features like this make a big difference from a user experience perspective, especially something as repetive as logging in, it has nothing to do with being lazy. You're a dumbass
---
Why my pp flaking off?
---
Yeah. I’ve been doing that for quite a while now.
---
He was in the cranberry bog tonight, first time I have seen him since beta.
---
East , north east of Fort Defiance. Random spawn area....

Oh and he cannot be tamed.
---
Seems to me that as soon as you leave the nuke zone the flowers go bad real fast.  Even going into The Whitespring strip mall seems to make it age sometimes; when I leave with my 6 crimson they are at half health after 3 minutes at the chem bench and 3 minutes of loading screens.  I can run a few laps at Whitespring and whatever I pick up is good to go, but leave the zone and it's random.  Cooked food, diseases, bobbleheads, magazines, anything timed seems to work the same.
---
Final Fantasy 14. Star Trek Online. Aion. Nearly every single mmo or instanced mmo game avoids storing passwords locally, for good reason.
---
PEOPLE ARE STUPID. 
---
The fact you think something being a common feature somehow means it has nothing to do with lazyness kinda proves the point. The vast majority of people with breached game accounts say the same thing.
---
Every time I want to change char or server, I need to relogin into the game. That's the most frequent.
---
Favourite glitch is the excavator weight thing.
---
Checked the ESM. Looks like they missed the extra damage off Heavy Spiked Rocket, so it's actually inferior to Heavy Spiked, as it doesn't have the 15% armor penetration.
---
True, but when it comes to that......... I aint too smart....
---
Bethesda starting to implement CBBE with physics on f076 perhaps? Till you know it AP from previous Fallouts would be in game as well.
---
Think it was actually mention in the patch notes at one point IIRC
---
I really want to change mine to, I'm a guy.... And I've grown up now, so I don't really want to be MrsSnugglyGeoff anymore 😂
---
This isn’t the Bethesda official support or suggestion board. It’s a reddit sub. Just because a community manager visits it does not mean it’s some kind of lazy fucks dump zone.
---
Congrats! 
---
I remember my first encounter. I was playing with a buddy and we just started crossing the savage divide. We were both probably in 30's. He went off ahead of me and crossed some railroad bridge, while i was busy on my pipboy. He was far enough that i lost visual.
---
Suddenly i just hear him freaking out, and i look into the distance. Asking what's up???? Confused.... Finally  I'm able to see him again as he is sprinting back across the bridge, still confused as i see nothing around him... when suddenly i see this massive creature flying above him, shooting some energy blasts at him. Like a scene from a movie, he's just running for his life and I'm just cracking up until i realize he's bringing it right to me!!! 
---
We were clearly not prepared. Even by picking up weapons from dead scorched, we had no ammo and our bullets just seems to bounce off the darn thing. Needless to say, things didn't end well for us. Ooh how i miss those days.. enjoy it while it lasts!
---
Favorite was when a dead Protectron got stuck in a Watoga shopping trolley and spun in circles forever.
---
Scorchbeast corpses randomly dropping out of the sky in front of you is always amusing though.
---
I can give u 3.5k for free if u want msg me when ur up again
---
deleted, wat?

Her questioning her mother's actions is one thing. I think she was right to question what she was doing at first. However the selfish turn she took is something I think can't be explained away, especially once she killed the one girl herself. If she wanted to leave and stop she could have done that easily. She was already constantly away. She could have just not come back home. If she wanted to take over that raider group she could have done that. She clearly felt by then that the training her mother was putting everyone through was working if she felt she could take over that gang once she was there.  The petty and evil way she betrayed everyone made me so angry as I was going through this.
---
Weird my power armor wasn't doing this last time I played. Hope it's just a bug for a few people and they fix it soon for you guys.
---
Go to trade subReddits.  It will resell 8k easy.
---
I've been buying all the TSE shotguns from player vendors at around 5k caps each and reselling them for 12k caps.
---
Just make sure your camp and vendor are next to the whitesprings station and they usually sell quickly
---
Can honestly say I’ve only entered it once. Never had to again since installing the launcher.......oh wait that’s because I don’t play it anymore 🥴
---
That was my thought as well.
---
Ah Whitesprings.  I traveled to a guys camp there to check out his wares.  Well wouldn't you know it, there were super mutants fighting a pair of SBs.
---
I stood in the doorway and took pot shots at and killed the green guys.  Then the flappy shits turned their attention to the camp.
---
They took out this guys purifier and turrets, then started on the building (he built a concrete tower).
---
They broke some walls and other things, so I'm running up and down the stairs repairing the walls and broken benches since I feel bad I probably drew attention by attack the muties.
---
Eventually the SBs went away and I fast traveled out.  Never did run across the owner though.
---
You know that they don't drop as explosive anymore while they retool that effect on it right? That TSE flamer is legacy. I'm sure when they bring it back to the drop tables it will act more like a flamer should.

Hear hear.

Leader of the pack, 3 legendaries. Even if they're garbage, you can sell for scrips.

used to have to aim your weapon, how you just walk up and press E like opening a door

Agreed

I'm from fallout 3 so I like t51b just for looks
---
I killed my first scorch beast today in the glass tavern. I got super lucky and hid behind a barrier and the scorchbeast got stuck and couldn’t attack. I just spammed it with my bunker blaster and grenade launcher which did actually nothing, and switched to my one star double pump only to kill it after 200 rounds. (Level 16 and I rushed all the main quests)
---
Nope, just from the Purveyor.  I have two three stars and they're just fine today.
---
*(Too bad the imposter isn't a skin for them...they're all better than it!)*
---
This. Had a guy just following me and another low level doing Free Range but doing absolutely nothing but watched. Naturally we failed the event and this guy had the audacity to give me a thumbs down emote. I went to his locked camp and gave him a surprise on his bed.
---
Yeah, folks like it for stealth builds.  But also, if you've scrapped your limit for the day, you're hosed.  Unless you wanna play 20+ hours!  (good luck doing it without a crash...)
---
What’s theory of having life giver with bloodied?
---
Yeah, fake news--it's been fixed for a while.  My quads and 3\* explosive and 3\* instigating all work great, thankyouverymuch.
---
What kind of flux do you need?
---
Well done and congrats! I remembered when I got my 1st legendary pistol and decided I had enough with running away from SBs. Took it down alone after a while and commemorated it with mandatory photo and grilled SB steak.
---
Violet flux mate....
---
Thanks anyway mate, signing off for a spell.
---
Smart kid.
---
Yeah, there's no way I haven't learned enough recipes, and I know I've gotten at least one deathblow on a SBQ.
---
They really owe every one of us who's been in since the B.E.T.A. a pile of atoms.
---
That and all the plans that have failed to drop from broken events.
---
27000 total, we're roughly 350 in IT.
---
Compared to the expenses of having the servers down during day shifts, and paying us for doing it outside office hours, the choice is rather simple, really.
---
Just personal preference, but I love the pipe revolver. It’s a great gun for leveling up with.
---
Ok, final build with all interchangeable perks

 Actually no. I was confused by your use of incorrect. Wrong would have been obvious.
---
No, Xbox
---
So you come back after all this time to say you’re easily confused?
---
In case you're looking for a nice legendary pistol, hit me up. I collect them and am a pistol build myself.

PC mods
---
 Excellent! You are now ready to hunt them. :)
---
Abinsursec2814.  sorry was asleep but I'll throw one your way tomorrow!
---
I honestly always assumed a Fallout Multiplayer game would allow Player Characters to encompass baseline humans, as well as Ghouls and Super Mutants. I guess after Fallout 4 we could add Synths to that list.
---
I guess I figured Bethesda would eventually add in the option to switch.
---
with my build I'm hovering around 600
---
this one looks like a giant metal disc in its mouth.  what the heck does piercing look like?!
---
Same lol. Tired of the T-45.
---
Heck ya i am. Not even nice just something to work with. Things are a bit rough right now and my only decent gun is the somerset lvl 15 haha.
---
 No your incorrect use of the word wrong has so many connotations I did not know what you meant.
---
 Usually people use incorrect to denigrate people not point out an error.
---
Do you value selling to the robo-vendors?
---
Couple of pure waters and a stim pack sell for more.
---
Is 100 stims plus 200 waters + your time + very minor crafting XL worth what you would sell 460 diluted (chemist and superduper)
---
I'm trying for a little better than what I could sell to vendors but less than someone could buy from vendors.   Not enough time on lately to see if sales are good.
---
Boy what a series of laughable mistakes you’re making. Now you’re throwing a fit because words are hard
---
2 star mongrel can’t drop 3 star items. Maybe the mongrel ate a one-star ghoul before you killed it.
---
happened to me around week ago - I've logged in and all vendors were empty. Spend an hour to fill them again :/
---
😂
---
This usually happens to me when I have logged in in a heavily populated area and try to put PA or loot items. But these actions are only delayed by 20-30 seconds until everything is loaded. Complete your pending quests to reduce the delay.
---
Actually, I completely agree. It was because of my friend being griefed all the time that I decided to build a competitive build that is pretty great in pvp. I have been playing since beta and while griefers were annoying. I did indeed streamline myself and make a stronger character because of it. Learned to always put my junk in stash before going anywhere.  My main is Brotherhood faction and doesn't raid and protects the weak. My secondary character was created with pvp in mind and a raider at heart. She raids people all the time. In essence griefers made me into one myself haha.
---
This haha
---
The loots are so good!
---
Nice suggestion by lots of ppl , but lets be realistic ...i doubt bughtesda could pull these things off . But lots of nice ideas 👍👍
---
I actually think the train stations are going to be used for this. There's menu options that hint at this.
---
What would be great is, if we could have a cross server goal to work towards getting the trains back online.
---
Kinda like the war effort quests back in WoW.
---
Would finally make it feel like we're rebuilding something.
---
Just, no? I’m sure it could be implemented in a balanced way.
---
I always laugh when i see you on my friendlist 😁 no offence
---
There are some non feral ghouls. They got slaughtered, but you can find their corpses and some chilling holo tapes.
---
Or how about a selector switch mod?
---
Do you know where? Building near there and being a vigilante would be cool as a ghoul.
---
If your in ps4 Il hook you up with something
---
I have several magazines in stock I'll be on at 10 a.m. eastern standard time. My gamertag is: sleepy4792, Xbox.
---
I can see this as something they'll add for Halloween event.
---
I'm kn ps4 lol, xbox doesnt even have platinum trophies 😅
---
And let's leave it at that.
---
You could just move your camp a hair. and for a whopping 40 caps its rebuilt.
---
Yeah we all started somewhere bud. You'll get there no doubt. Proud to say I managed all the way with just pistols and it can be done albeit slower progress and always sneaking. Take care out there!
---
phased plasma rifle in the 40 watt range
---
I completely disagree. I play this as an RPG, and love going through the game on multiple specs as different characters. It would just be really nice to send an alt some of that gear to make the beginning Grind a little easier. Or to send extra plans to- because I love camp building- but don’t always want to move the camp of my main character to make a new one. Those are just two examples of why I would love this feature.
---
Please do not pigeonhole everyone else as only enjoying the game the way that you do, or assume that everyone is just here to go over cap limits and mule.
---
And if you are limited to a certain number of characters tied to the game- who cares if other people mule? It certainly does not reduce my pleasure or enjoyment in the game just because people liked to hoard things. If anything I think duper’s and rampant bugs are 10x worse than someone carrying more caps or resources between their characters.
---
I based my prices purely on what I thought I would pay for them minus a few caps because it doesnt take much effort for me to mass produce them. I didnt even consider vendor bot prices but I may look into it if I think I can make a few hundred more caps and keep them going regularly.
---
&gt; challenges can’t be completed 6 months after launch
---
One of these days I'll get credit for discovering Grafton Dam and get those 40 atoms for it. I believe in that golden age to come.
---
Same I got a anti armor ultracite laser pistol with fire rate and agility today. I'm going to hold onto it in case they fix it.
---
Yea im lvl 170 now and i remeber beeing lvl 60-70 ish fighting 5 or 6 scorchbeast at once. I had a friend with me tho, but it was so intense and i truly felt like a bamf After the battle was over.
---
Nowadays i laugh when a lvl 80 scorchbeast appears.
---
Well done m8, remember this triumph
---
Being a ghoul or a super mutie opens up a whole other can of worms when you consider factions. You're basically disallowed from being in the BOS, though the Enclave miiiiiight allow muties. I feel like you'd just be your own faction. 
---
Consider this: in TESV it was possible to become a vampire, and a werewolf *simultaneously*.  You could also pick your race at the start. You could literally be a cat or a lizard person, on top of a vamp-wolf. Why they didn't carry that idea over to a fallout game is... beyond me? I'd love to be a cybernetically enhanced, mutated super-ghoul. Hell I'd be down to pick a robot character and subsist on fusion cores!! Or an android! The possibilities are endless.
---
I'm on xbox and would appreciate the buisness
---
Except that you can literally spend 40 caps in game to move your camp and its instantly rebuilt even if its a foot away. You all are crying and you dont even understand how the mechanics of the game fully work.
---
Mkay.
---
Plans
---
Ahhh interesting!
---
Check the area around Pleasent Valley Ski buildings. There're about 6 semi-frequent spawn spots. Also, Watoga has some inside market and bus.
---
The only ways to counter this is either buy more of those same guns or buy the repair kits from atom shop.
---
Hell yea i want to be a ghoul or have a ghoul skin
---
Marine helmet
---
Do you happen to be on ps4 and able to drop me some
---
FACTION BASED CAMP ITEMS!!!!!
---
I’ve actually seen vendors filled with unwanted gear that looks like it’s from the purveyor. Many bad 3* rolls.
---
5) It definitely used to work with super duper, as I know how many I bulked and every so often I would here the super duper sound trigger and I had more than I had made. They changed this earlier this year around Feb or Mar. If it can apply for making armor and weapons, why not bulk? This was never mentioned as a bug fix in any release notes.
---
8) I am level 170 something with three star legendary sentinel armor. Definitely far from impenetrable. I can usually take like 5 or 6 hits from a level 91 deathclaw, though he put me down in 2 to 3 hits. 2nd hit I am at half health, and 3rd hit I go down. Why did the 3rd hit take me down from half health?
---
Nope. I'm not sure if the trophy works the same way as Challenges. For Challenges, picking mags from player drops or trades dont count...
---
Not sure
---
Seen way to many people like that. They dont realise that prices are usually based on the rolls and not the fact its 3 stars for example 2* tse or 2* bloodied. Explosive can be worth an absolute mint
---
What specific spots there so you know? I have the audio perk but idk the noise it makes
---
The vendor issues have been there since vendor machines were introduced. I've read here the number actually represents how many of that item the buyer has in their inventory but yeah it definitely doesn't show how many was actually sold
---
How about a weight reduction perk as well.
---
Anyone else find it curious that on the weapon wheel the Quantum Grenade shows as a gun, not a grenade? It's almost like it's meant to be a more targeted weapon. Its current behaviour is odd and I'd much sooner it performed like an even more devastating Nuka Grenade.
---
I'm having the same problem as well, I was playing the quest last night and up to the part where you have to collect the ingredient's to make the Nukashine and the marker for the Nuka-Cola Plant has disappeared
---
For me it is still AA/E even as i am not a low health player.
---
Yea I know but in my case it always was by selling ammo, now it's on everything I sell atm. Wrong numbers overall haha
---
Thanks, I’ll try.
---
I don't care if they drop the rate of 3* enemies appearing to compensate. I just want the number of stars on the drops to match the stars in their names instead of getting my hopes up every single time I come across a 3* only for it to drop some 1* raider armor. If the only difference between a 1* enemy and a 3* enemy is the drop, then why not make the name match the drop?
---
Thank you, I will try this!
---
Thanks for the confirmation amigo :)
---
Nocturnal. lmao
---
3 stars or 3 legendarys
---
El ttsunami
---
yeah i did that last night when i deleted and reinstalled the game and then i deleted the save data that is the setting still no luck unfortunately
---
Praise unto Ug-Qualtoth.
---
Sorry to hear
---
I usually sell chems in general for 10-15c. I sold around 40-50 stimpaks over the last 3 days for 15c. Your price is probably even more reasonable than mine.
---
Just wait a bit... my guess is it keeps worse the more time pass.
---
Can't wait for the upcoming daily challenge:
---
*"kill a overseer rank 149, while intoxicated with nuclear winter during a Suppressor."*
---
You could be a mutant and gain permanent plus 4 strength and enurance, minus 4 Intelligence and agility, and perception. You'd be mostly immune to radiation. Akin to wearing a hazmat suit in a nuke zone. Super Mutants won't attack you, but random robots might. Cannot use power armor, only super mutant armor. Fewer clothing options. But you're the hulk and can one-punch man everything if you have the perks.
---
Or
---
A ghoul that is totally immune to radiation damage, and is even healed by the ticking of your geiger counter, even in combat. You'd be a nuke zone god, and maybe even start glowing yourself! Plus 4 Endurance and 4 Agility while in the presence of radiation (i'm thinking toxic water could could be your go-to tonic water with its own fun effects, just for ghouls). Minus 4 Charisma at all times, making trading prices kind of suck. (But think of all the radaway you could sell!) Maybe minus 2 strength when not around radiation. Ghouls won't attack you, robots are neutral. Can use power armor and human clothes.
---
I'm just thinking there's a fallout race that fits everyone's play-style. Muties could be mostly melee and unarmed. Ghouls would probably go ranged, but melee wouldn't be out of the question.
---
Hahaha that would be to hard 😂
---
PSA: the *overseer chair (5/5)* in *win a Match* is a good spot to get it done.
---
Post a video and other players may be able to FIX it for you. Screen shot can even help im sure a fix will come granted, I know we need a camp update, but
---
the community knows almost all work arounds.
---
They should 100% NOT add *a si gle thing* that will make it any easier for greedy player who seem to have no job or anything else to do, to ruin it for casual players.
---
The whole fucking mess that was trying to find the X01 PA paint as a casual player... don't make it easier for them. 
---
I don't even want a transfer system. You want the benefit of 800lb with a mule character, you waste your own time moving shit back and forth.
---
Nice. My best wep so far from purveyor is 3* furious, explosive, +1 str 50. Cal machine gun. Also got a furious, Explosive lmg that I use as backup.
---
Now only thing I want is a tse gatling gun. Seen a dude selling one for 50+k caps not paying that for it would rather trust rng lol
---
I am on PS4, although I just finished up for the night. I can be on tomorrow though
---
I saw a guy build the spawn in location to his camp on top of an acid vein and sealed it off. He had one vending machine outside the camp.
---
This is cooler, good ideas dude.
---
  Earth Mover, Event: Lode Baring, Event: Breach and Clear, and Event: Battle Bot  
---
These are supposedly the only events of the many that spawn in the Ash Heap. Though I have had no luck getting the plan myself despite constantly doing B&amp;C endlessly. =(
---
Right lol
---
I've updated in regards to Bullet Shield and Blocker - thanks for the suggestion. In regards to Power Patcher I've decided to keep that in.... whilst I agree the 'cheaper to repair' part of the perk is only viable fixing the P.A the 60% slower to break is too valuable in my eyes to loose. Saying that though theory and practice are 2 different things and I'll see when in the field if what you suggest is the better option. Cheers amigo - really appreciate your replies :)
---
Cheap dude, too cheap.

Thank me later.

Nice spots are the road between camden park and Sunshine Meadows industrial farm, so is pleasant valley and whitesprings
---
I too am changing my build to a hybrid rifleman and Melee. I’ll tell you. I’m still not 100% with what I want for my intelligence, agility, luck. I recently got an explosive assault rifle, (+30% ghoul damage, explosive bullets, +1 perception) so I’m planning to use that soon. I my melee weapon for now is sludge hammer (20%  faster swing speed and Damage increased after each consecutive hit on the same target.) 
---
Anyways.. I it is hard to be both classes. But it is possible. I reck enemies with my Hammer up close. And I can easily solo Scorch beasts. Sure it takes longer to kill. But I can still kill them alone now. 
---
I use power armor  still converting away from the excavator set. It’s hard not being a hoarder. I all most have a full set of ultracite power armor. You can probably use whatever you want.  Here is what I plan to have. I’m still trying to unlock the correct perk cards I’m lvl 75 (I was a “commando” build before but the Constant ammo grinding made me switch)

It definitely doesn't I'm heavy gun so my strength is at like 15.  I get 405 I believe.  Although i dont have the shocks so maybe that's why
---
Medic might not be necessary, I’m not going for a bloody build. Idk.. You have and idea. I didn’t build this with legendary weapons in mind but it’s nice when you do get a legendary.

If anyone would care to know I have updated the build now. This is thanks to peoples suggestions etc.

I've reduced the perk Tenderizer to one \* and added in 2 points of extra Endurance for 25% each food/drink 'satisfaction'. This has had the added bonus of raising Hit Points from 315 to 325 - not much but you never know when those extra HP are needed lol.
---
Thank you one and all :)
---
No. I'm pretty happy with my PSN. And no, I'm not telling you what it is.
---
Idk what the sound is tho
---
Nah man, EB games in Australia
---
This is genuinely a great story! I’m level 61 and I still haven’t taken one down by myself. I’m a melee build which doesn’t help though.
---
I lucked out and got some really good stuff the night before but ever since it’s either been bad rolls that sell for a lot, like you said, or just garbage
---
I usually sell them for what I get at a vendor stim 12, diluted 3. I can always make more stims if need be.
---
It really depends on what you want to do with it. I use heavy guns and I alternate between Furious, Two Shot Explosive, and Faster Fire Rate Explosive. Some things I want to kill very quickly, so I go TSE and just sort of spray the mobs, but for the Scorchbeast Queen I tend to want a Furious because the damage adds up quickly. A fellow redditor (Sorry, I forget who) made this great calculator where you can compare damage outputs for various legendary effects in various situations.

I was about level 45 when I took on my first.  It was near Jack's Pumpkin House.  There were two guys there in PA taking on the three that spawn from a nearby fissure.  I was just there in my regular armour and non- legendary weapons.  I decided to stand with them and used up all of my 5.56 ammo and had to switch to my sniper rifle before we took them down.  I also took out the scrotched that spawn and did my best to keep them off of the guys in power armor.  I died a couple of times along the way but we finally took them down.
---
For real cuz it's honestly a beast, I'm sure AAE or Bloodied could beat it out but it's seriously an amazing gun, I miss it already. Just pull the trigger and blast everything away
---
Up with you!
---
Impressive that you can, but why play it on a tiny screen?  
---
This is why I don't bother with almost any form of mobile gaming, the screen's too small.  
---
I'll stick with my sizeable TV, looks much better.
---
I killed my first scorchbeast at around level 80 with a short gatling gun lvl 50 non legendary, no upgrades. Used like 30 stimpaks (this at the time when the search exploit was present - you could search first aid containers over and over with pharma farma after entering and exiting watoga Emergencu services constantly - used up all stimpaks now though and lost like 100 in survival mode) and around 500 5mm bullets. After this, I felt way more confident in any other fight in fallout 76
---
Don't worry! We all made mistakes once in a while. Like exactly the same happened to me. Good thing is: The vendor system is now in! I just put my shotgun in it for 7000 caps a few days, when suddenly someone recently bought it.
---
wait...

The whole entire reason why you are here is to pick a fight, making light of autism is not acceptable, stalking people, insulting them and desperately trying to pick a fight whilst hid behind your keyboard because you are angry over some video games is the action of a coward. Have a word with yourself.
---
I'm a simple man. I read phones i respond -

*"DoN't YoU gUyS hAvE pHoNeS?!"*
---
But now I'm doing an OP bloodied stealth commando build with VATS criticals - I can take down any scorchbeast (except scorchbeast queen) in less than 10 shots (record - killed a scorchbeast in 4 bullets once with adrenaline at +48% damage) with my bloodied handmade rifle. The build is so OP that I can do this even with a lvl 35 bloodied handmade rifle - imagine this with a lvl 45 bloodied handmade rifle!
---
Lol thought I was the only one digging through bat crap
---
With +50% VATS crit dmg lmao
---
Rather pay the caps for it and play the game for an hour instead of log in and out for an hour. What a waste of time when I get a few hours after work to play. Thankfully people will do it and I will pay the caps for shit I want.
---
Yeah I laugh at how easy it is to kill scorchbeasts with my build too. I can kill each one in like five 5.56 rounds with my bloodied handmade rifle. I once had 4 scorchbeasts flying around me and killed them all in around 1 minute
---
I don't know how to dupe, nor do I want to or need to.
---
Just gotta say, why would you use a 10mm smg? it's like the worst weapon cause it consumes shitloads of ammo
---
give it up, its hard to believe any off you guys with the same post, im not saying everyone is guilty but give it up, if you really wanted to play the game you would be right now.
---
and next time dont cheat.
---
Before getting Fallout I was really hoping I could be the John Hancock Of 76. Just building’ cool shit for people &amp; stabbing insurance scammers.
---
A mutant's with +10% damage while aiming would be decent, if you have any mutations.
---
This is exactly it. I buy stuff like this because server hopping for an hour is a waste of my time. Caps are endless, I can get more just by playing. But my time isn't endless and I'm not wasting it on boring ”gameplay”.
---
Especially Stingwings, when you can't even bloody see them.
---
So?
---
Yeah, this is a big that’s known to not be able to be fixed in game currently.
---
You recon it when you hear it believe me. It's a springy noise first followed by a sound like quick flipping pages.
---
Sometimes to make fast travel easy. However if someone joins your team, and initaites pvp with another, you become open to PvP due to being on a team.
---
Ahhh one of those I gotta move the damn camp bugs...
---
I’d feel like a badass too if my build weren’t in ruins lol
---
Could be a robbery, most of the time though folks do have perks that only activate when in a party
---
Your lucky it didn't eat a fat man and use it on you.
---
I'm not sure if its just strange luck or if its systematic, but always when I team up with strangers while farming, I get always better items. I had situation where 2 legendaries have been in one corpse.
---
The other reason is obvious, if your teammate or you kills a mob, both players get loot, regardless if hitting the opponent or not. If youre not in a team, only the players who hit the opponent get loot.
---
And where are those 2 places? Havent played in months...
---
Have you try ed a scan repair?.
---
I thought as you did and posted my 'build' on the FO:76 build sub reddit a few days ago. I got one reply and that was it. Came on here and got a fair bit of helpful advice :)
---
I've seen team invites sent out by players during events that do not have a server notification, for awareness I believe.  Such as Free Range or the Arktos events.
---
Lol what should i say... I'm a gourmet by heart.
---
I don't know what is going on with this challenge I did several deathclaws and scorched beasts and got it on the 6th dead deathclaw. I would just say keep taking pictures of different deathclaws/SBs and you will eventually get it. (note: I had the 105mm and the name popped up in every picture so it wasn't user error)
---
If they are a lower level than you they may want to do missions with you to level up faster. Or if they are a higher level they may just want to help you out. Sometimes they may just not have any friends online and want to team up.
---
I’ve yet to team up with anyone on the game who wanted to do harm or steal.
---
There’s also the other option which is they were trying to fast travel but your blip is over the FT point and they accidentally sent a team invite instead. I’ve done that myself several times.
---
I gave up on it just can't find it more chance to find elvis as a goulash.
---
Yeah feels bad :/ Pets are awesome but they need to be able to respawn.
---
I posted in here a good few hours ago about my P/A and H. Weapon build. Whilst I am going for a different approach my 'final build might help you some ......
---
I'm running no mutations in that build but I'm happy with it after some community feedback from here :)
---
Good job also you were at south end if the springs right? That place is bad news bears always, lost a base and 100 diluteds plus whatever armor and ammo I had when I thought it'd be a good place to settle... At any rate have fun killing the pinatas with four disappointing items inside
---
Yeah I'm so sick of this whenever I get 3 star enemies they almost always drop a fukin 1 star hunters wood left leg or some shit (once actually got a hunter's wood left leg from super mutant at west tek and then the next mutie i killed dropped a hunter's wood right leg - beautiful legendary drops, right?). also bethesda had better remove wood armor rolling pins walking canes and lead pipes from the legendary list cause they're so trash no matter what the effects
---
The puking emote should suffice
---
I am really late but please msg me on xbox my GT is Zambah and I would LOVE some people to do this mission with.
---
Ahh yeah this seems like a good reason.
---
Add 100lbs for the two mods. It's a big difference.
---
I have a vending machine and what I sell is my choice, mainly selling known plans, but it's my shop, my rules. (Lvl 123). I don't feel embarrassed, but then again I'm not whining.
---
erm excuse me? you have to launch a goddamn nuke to awake the sbq and that takes fukin ages. you need to get a nuclear keycard as well which is a random drop from a random strategic air command cargobot flying god knows where all over appalachia
---
I would add also I haven’t ran into many bad people out to harm me overall this game is the friendliest group I’ve ever played with online. I do get the random player trying to instigate PVP I believe.
---
The mire
---
You summed up almost all the problems correctly. You just forgot the players,they make new attackers spawn and the new vendor system is not good for this.
---
Before player vending ,my camp had almost no visitors and one deathclaw resisted for almost 2 months.
---
The pet system needs a overhaul indeed.
---
If you join a server where your CAMP spot is already taken; click the option to stay on server then quit to main menu.
---
Avoid the other option (Find another world)
---
that's a trash cost you need hard bargain at rank 3 that the only time everything has a decent cost
---
Synths won't exist for 200 ish years
---
I took on one solo myself the other night. I'm lvl 44.
---
It was a long battle with my Fixer, .50 cal hunting rifle and my Raider PA.
---
At one point I thought it was going to fly away. Fortunately it stuck around and I eventually killed it.
---
Nowhere near as dramatic as your story, but I was stoked to solo one after previously kiting one to a nearby Camp for assistance.
---
I too felt bad-ass and won't run away any more.
---
Now excuse me why I go and craft more .45 ammo.
---
For the first question. Yes it is in a better state in both stability and performance, this doesn't mean crashes and server disconnect s will bot happen though. Also many bugs are fixed, some has reintroduced and many introduced with new content, so it will never be bug free.
---
For the second question, we await the roadmap to next content to be revealed in E3. But the title for the DLC is "Nuclear winter". So far we know that there will be instanced vaults, player can become legendary and due to recent leaks Overseer ranks.
---
Like with almost all weapons Bloodied/Anti Armor with Firerate/Explosive and 25% less vats cost/15% faster crit refill.
---
IMHO Anti Armor is on heavies equally good as Bloodied because they dont have Anti Armor clips and the Anti-Armor perk only works while wearing a Power Armor. 
---
I prefer Firerate over Explosive in PvP and Explosive over Firerate in PvE. I always perfer 25% less Vats cost over 15% crit refill, but thats just because I always oversee the crit meter and almost always forget to use crits.
---
This I never considered but that could be a benefit. Do you add a comment or message explaining ? It would be hard to guess that someone wants to be notified
---
What? I never took a workshop. Yea I didn't realise you couldn't get killed if u don't fire at them back. Me n my friends a few times went to get exp and we would get high levels rush us with nifes and machetes. Now I think about it they probs did it to makes us fire at them without tbinking and with them noing we are noobs and didn't no the rule,  they would loot us every time lol. And I'm like How is this fair? Dudes that are 100+ levels above us wipeing us out every time and we can't defend ourselves! Next thing u no it my brain said " write on Reddit, you will feel better 😂 nec miniut I'm here writing this to you.
---
I've had people do it for the pvp with team mates to destroy my base but that was rare. Ive had people add me for fast travel options or for help with quests. I've had people want to team up just for the perk sharing options. It's hard to give a blanket statement but from my experiences it can end really badly however that does seem very minimal compared to the fun that can be had with some randoms
---
Amazon has a physical copy for $33.60, free shipping. 
---
A couple weeks ago it was $25, that's when I picked it up.
---
My apologies I meant a damage decrease when compared to Anti-Armor
---
Last night it was a guy that was like level 217 and I’m a 110 so maybe to work the blast zone with me maybe
---
Yup i completely forgot that players also spawn the enemies and that the camp is still spawning on their pc not mine.. so the Deathclaw spawned and got killed by the muties long before my turrets were even spawned in..
---
I just mean that that's probably why it hasn't been sold. I get you don't have one though
---
The way I read it, he was using it as a last resort before looting dead scorched.
---
That’s my main thought. There that one you get more XP in a team.
---
I bet they expect us to not use the radio and listen to other sounds from iTunes, SoundCloud etc. I do :)
---
I add people if I’m going solo for the herd mentality mutation, I then tend to share the perk card for when in a team gain 10% extra xp plus if lower level help out where possible with kit etc
---
Nope.
---
Hello no I've spent like 6 months levelling my character to level 180.
---
Which level are you rn?
---
oh ok
---
I usually check the map to see if anything is going on, a few times I've accepted the invite, if they have a mic they will say there is an event happening or without a mic just emoji wheel "come this way" and if I'm free I'll join the event, if I'm busy I'll kick the team. Prior to player vending, most of my random invites were low levels looking to fast travel to my location, I'm not seeing not much of that anymore.
---
I'm sorry for your loss. R.I.P. Steve... will there be a service?
---
107
---
Oh great, a whiner, please stop flapping your lips.
---
I was wary but I'm really glad I bought it. I've really been enjoying it and have had zero performance issues and haven't really noticed any bugs (other than the usual Bethesda engine quirks).
---
I partly bought it because they have said there will be lots more expansions and updates. I don't really miss NPC's as much as I thought I would and I think they have said they are coming, later this year I believe.
---
There is certainly thousands of hours of gameplay there already. I've barely scratched the surface. I always play solo and that's fine but if you wanted to team up, the people I've met in game seem cool too.
---
Not sure what full price is now but I got it on PC for £9!  I'd happily have spent more on it knowing what I know now.
---
In that case you will have to pay scrip to sell it lol
---
My TS Pump Shotgun performs pretty well, apart from being highly dependent on headshots.
---
Saying Preston in a conversation about Fallout 76 is terrible, it's almost as bad as having your undergarments infested with 1\* glowing radroaches.
---
I was like you. I clocked fallout3 3 times, new Vages twice and fallout4 once. I'm like no npcs? Reviews are shit and people say it's lonley as he'll....... fk that I'm not buying it. A few months pass......... pre own copie goes on special for $9.00. Eh why not it's only 9$.  My review now? The game with Npcs you don't even notice and there are heaps of robots vending and cruising around insulting you! L o l. The game is lonley? He'll no it's not lonley, so many players are All ways on and I've meet so many great people I now play with. Dude I love  this game and can't wait to get back on it at nights after a long day at work. But the game is very different with eating and drinking. It's a full time job on its own! And you can't max your player out with special, you only get 50 so chose wisely.  Don't don't even hesitate to buy it. Just get it All ready!
---
Can you split up the Abundant Flora further?    
---
Without Blackberry, Soot, and Rhododendron? it covers up some of the rarer ones and they're harder to see on the map. 
---
Thank You!
---
Good.
---
Head to whitesprings, on the balcony of the most northern  house is a spawn point, so is in the Golf Club in the small room behind the counter downstairs, another possible spawn point there is the lounge room in the middle, right side on the bottom of a shelf. Or upstairs in the bathrooms next to the resturant - the left one, under the sink.
---
Additional there is also a magazine spawn point at safe'n clean disposal - north of Whitesprings.
---
Drop demo expert and make gunsmith rank 5. You can than make the rifle csrd thsts level 2 up to level 3.
---
But I have a Explosive Handmade and it does more damage with it right?
---
I love my T-60 but I do use an Ultacite Helmet as I like the look.
---
For radiation zones, which is where I mostly use PA now, I use a level 3 ghoulish perk and any extra damage I take over the T-51b is healed by radiation and I take less radiation damage.  
---
This doesn't work as well for recent SBQ fights as the current strategy is to fight her out of the radiation zone.  But I've switched up from using a Melee weapon to a Zealots 50 cal explosive machine gun.  Since I'm fighting from range, I don't take as much damage as I used to when doing Melee.
---
I wonder in a radiation zone where you get constant radiation damage if the extra 100 radiation resistance of the T-60 and a Level 3 Ghoulish perk causes it to be superior than the T-51b +65 damage resist.   For example, I can be surrounded by glowing ones in White Springs and I hardly take any damage to my health and only a little bit of radiation damage.  And what health damage I do take is instantly healed by the Ghoulish perk.
---
"Some bought 53067 10mm rounds from my machine where I only got 700 in it."
---
The game doesn't tell how much they brough, it tells how much they have. No change.
---
You'll see people there if they are underground doing the uranium fever event. Often the Uranium fever hexagon marker will be there as well if the event is"in session". If the marker is over the Quonset hut, you'll know it hasn't been started by anyone yet.
---
Make daily limit 500scrips. That is more than you will get just by playing and dupers wont be able to exploit it.
---
Don't knock it. That's a great gun.
---
Don't think 3\* perks stack. Looks to me like you have the ideal situation to me though. I also have 1-3\* of the same perk so I change them out depending on what other perks I want to run.
---
Never thought of using that way. It's too much of a pain to craft though so I only craft it for challenges or the daily.
---
Ditto.
---
My character is a Responders medic with a Laser Rifle named "Oathkeeper".  I try to base as much of my gameplay around being a medic as possible.
---
Something along these lines would be great, I'm the only one left still playing out of my regular group. I've deliberately been avoiding the pioneer scout quest line because of the revive part as I'm flying solo.
---
[It definitely does](https://i.imgur.com/36S6edA.png), I get 545 on my heavy gunner with excavator... but only with the carry weight bug. Otherwise it's only 445 and that's with 15 str and dual calibrated shocks. Bonus points if you mod your excavator chest to give bonus str; I've yet to do this.
---
Really? It seems like no matter what I do they will always hit me. Pretty annoying
---
The only thing worse than communism is survival mode
---
We can't even get that new gramophone at our camps so what are the chances we get a new radio station?
---
I didn't realize I couldn't make more and scrapped a few of mine before I realized the mistake.  I still have a few but as many as I would like now. :(
---
The cargobot carrying Nuclear Keycards are not so random...  They only appear random because most don't know where to look.   There are three locations that I have consistently found them:  Top of the World area, Harpers Ferry, and Wavy Willard's Water Park.
---
I also understand that you can see the current location of the cargobots in the Enclave bunker at White Springs.  I've never used this method as I've always had no problems finding them.
---
The one thing that I didn't realize is that if you take down the cargobot, everyone in the area can get their own Nuclear Keycard prior to the container blowing up.  I always thought that it was one of those items that disappeared once someone claimed it.
---
If you want to be spared the effort of finding them, I have 4x in my store for 100 caps each \[PS4\].  Plus I have another 4x in my stash and 8x on my person.   I obviously need to go on a few Nuke runs but other players have been launching Nukes lately just as I'm about to go on a run, likely due it being a requirement for one the Pioneer Scout badges.
---
this weekend I got a break ... so maybe I try to play via streaming via cloud gaming (nvidia shield, I do not need a separate pc on any site) or maybe I have to ask someone to leave me a few moments teamviewer to look at least atomic store XD
---
What's wrong with melee right now?
---
Only time I use it is if I happen to get it for one of the biv repeatables.
---
Pretty sure that said we would be able to...eventually. So probably in the fall add-on.
---
I can kind of see why they removed the option to pick up and move things, that way people can;t troll others hiding quest objectives. 
---
At the same time, it makes sense to at least let us have the option we had in 4 which was to move things inside the workshop menu. Pick up and move things the same way you do camp items. Although they would also have to give us a way to get junk items and nring them out in a way not involving paper bags. 
---
Hell, maybe give us a camp item that if we feed 5 or 10 of a particular junk item, it gives us a plan for a craftable version of said item.
---
For example I feed it 10 jangles the Moon Monkeys and thereafter I can craft them, within my Camp only and only I, as the one who made it, can move it.
---
Theres a faster fire rate explosive gun?
---
It could work well with armour that has low rad protection or for extra protection with PA. The duration of the drinks effect just need to be worth the effort.
---
Unfortunately the new alcohol drinks don't work with Party Boy perk card. Radshield with Chem Fiend works alright, but higher rad res than one provided by a PA is needed if running with regular armor...
---
I support this totally. Also i'd say rifleman as the perk: it would be easier to code since it would use the same trigger mechanic.
---
I play a full medic build with the empath mutation, and I would absolutely love what you are talking about.  I really wish there was more diverse builds and more people willing to party up to play off of each others strengths and weaknesses.  I could be passively reducing the damage the whole party is taking, while the tank makes sure I never see the downside the empath by keeping the mobs off of me.  I could keep him healed up while the damage oriented teammates could be destroying the enemies before his taunt times out.  I know most games try to move away from the traditional holy trinity style party system, but I for one absolutely love it.
---
Would you mind sharing? I've found that server-hop killing Ticks at Moonshiner's Shack and Gilman Lumber Mill is pretty lucrative and simple, so I'm curious what another good method would be.
---
No idea why Bethesda restricts .308 round crafting to just 24 (48 if SD activates) per batch, it really does limit how often you can use the LMG. I have an Explosive Double Capacity LMG on my heavy gunner build and I only use it as an absolute last resort against the toughest enemies, otherwise you eat through its ammo much much *much* faster than you can craft the damn stuff.
---
Flying Radscorpions. Snipe a Radscorpion from long range on a hill, on the second shot they will dig underground to you, but you are able to see them move above ground whilst they do so.
---
Except in F76, all character are same, so there really is no need for alts in that perpective. I get in WoW, where you have Rogue, Mage, Hunter etc, so you want to play different class, but in F76, you don't have classes, so you basically can use same character to play different roles.
---
Hope the drinks not working is just a bug.
---
Username checks out.
---
Everyone else is sitting round the fire swapping stories and he's waving away like a madman at these "Flyinh Creechures". No more Hoppy Hunter for you!
---
If love to have this as a big poster on my wall!
---
I play a medic build and get the most benefit from playing in a group, so I try to group up whenever I can.  But a lot of times people just don't want to, not sure if it's Lone Wanderer, or afraid I'm going to grief them or something, I'm not sure.  I wish there was some sort of group finder or something of that nature in the game.  I don't have a mic and there's no text chat so most of the time it's just me shooting random invites at strangers... I could see how that comes off as strange.  xD
---
I recommend using perk card fireproof lvl 3 to counter the sonic attacks. Sonic attacks have almost no impact/damage after using that perk card.
---
It might not be what happened to you, but I always run into a bug where the condition of items with the same name end up matching.
---
Example: I have Raw Cobalt that's at 10%. I pick up Raw Cobalt that's 100%. It's a random chance if I end up with 2 Raw Cobalt at 100% or two Raw Cobalt at 10%........
---
This happens with flux, food, fermentable beers, etc.
---
TL;DR Maybe you had one close to expiring already and the ones you picked up copied their condition
---
The people who work on this game don't play video games, they don't play THIS game for sure, they don't take pride in their work and they openly despise people who play their game. These are verifiable facts. nuff said
---
Nice photos!
---
I saw a guy roaming the wasteland in a swim suit, welders goggles and a faded visor. I gave him the thumbs up and received a bullet to the face in return.
---
Would have appreciated the middle finger much more!!
---
Yeah, I love having a pet, but respawning is a necessity for them at this point. They are just too fragile, and with other players now consistently spawning enemies they just don’t stand a chance.
---
R.I.P. Steve :(
---
that's rediculous. I could go outside and rummage through my neighbors trashcan and put together an idea of what he was doing the last week. That doesn't mean I'm experiencing a fuckin STORY.
---
Yea im a bloodied PA heavy gunner...
---
I'd imagine a bloodied rifleman is fun to play aswell :)
---
As much as I hate wendigos the damn radtoads and ticks freak me out.
---
If you don't mind possibly taking a few hits in the process, the Eastern Regional Penitentiary also has quite a lot of tin can traps (some in the main building and some in the courtyard).
---
I like the bear arm. It's fun.
---
I've only ever received the item and no plans. :'(
---
Sssssshush......   don't let them know....   .grin.
---
Yeah, they didn't used to but they are now.   
---
I was lead hunting last night.  Had the Grafton Steel Yard (2x Steel, 1x Lead), The Converted Munitions Factory (.50 cal rounds, 1x Lead, 1x Junk), Hemlock Holes (2x Acid), and Thunder Mountain (1x Fusion Core, 1x Steel).  I also hit all of the big spots for lead.  Took me 4 hours (including all of the defend and retake events) but I went from 8K .50 cal rounds, 0 5.56 rounds, and 4K shotgun rounds to 18K .50 cal rounds, 5K 5.56 rounds, 4.5K shotgun rounds, and a bunch of plans for my shop...
---
I would have had a ton more shotgun rounds but that's what I was using for the defend events.  I must have gone through 1K+ shotgun rounds just killing off spawns.
---
The hardest part....  finding enough cloth to produce gunpowder and aluminum to repair weapons and workshop items.  Going forward I'm storing 100 cloth in my stash instead of just 50.
---
Pet peeve:  That we can't scrap ammo of other types for lead.  I think that a ratio of 10 to 1 would be fair.
---
Looks fine for a hybrid build. Has all the things you need and nothing you don’t.
---
You got extras to trade per chance still if in Xbox? Msg me gt chnm88 if so.
---
Um. Got extras fro trade per chance? If on Xbox gt chnm88
---
Yea i guess you are right. About that one. 
---
Do you know how much damage the explosive effect deals? I'm not too sure about it as I stopped using explosive stuff a long time ago
---
No issues with Pip-boy here but sprinting is broken. Someone it will for 10 seconds before the AP meter starts to decrease sometimes it refuses to Sprint at all for a second or two.
---
Go to cdkeys, got it for 13 bucks there
---
Thanks, I guess that’s just a bug in general. Any tips for the Pip-Boy one?
---
Martial Artist, Incisor, Iron Fist, Adrenal Reaction, Blocker, Serendipity, Talons, Twisted Muscles.
---
Brawling and Weighted armor mods both work with a PowerFist. You can add puncturing to it as a mod to tweak your armor pen and possibly skip Incisor.
---
Martial Artist is a must. Incisor if you have no AP (see above).
---
You can significantly raise your DR with the Armored Backpack and Scaly Skin but remember Scaly Skin costs AP - so you'll lose VATS (lol melee VATS) and, more importantly, sprinting.
---
Or from the queen
---
I'd ne Happy if the juke Box could also play the music from the frat house... I mean it's already there
---
Hey, that looks pretty dope! Do you have any other art works?
---
I wanted to level up all of my animated cards and am now stuck with the same problem. :\
---
Animated cards should be able to eat max level cards.
---
I randomly get the notification that i picked up 4 of them. Happens every single time I play and they actually show up in my inventory. I think whitesprings has a few on the course water hazards.
---
I doubt that because they specified Party Boy description to include "pre-war" drinks instead of "alcohol". Additionally, double effects would make the brews too powerful imo. Longer duration would be awesome, though.
---
I play on PS4 and usually accept team invite from random people. Most often it's from a lower level player who needs help on a quest (or chased by ghouls at whitespring). Higher levels usually mean they want a cheap fast travel point to my location or they are leaving the game and they want to give you their workshop. Haven't had any trouble yet.
---
This game isn't an mmo so people shouldn't be expecting mmo mechanics.
---
That's a better idea. Hell even 300
---
I believe both are slot 2 perks so no
---
How would that work with the Rifleman and Commando perks?
---
Understood. With a 30 - 60 min duration i might become a alcoholic ;)
---
What? O_O
---
I can't see anything wrong mate... You already have a 3* so the 2* up rank is useless to get two of the 3* cause they want stack at all
---
Gotta be honest, i didn't know pets were a thing until  i visited someone's camp that had a death claw and a cat. Upon spawning in i see this thing walking towards me so i blast it to pieces. Then the owner walks out stands there doing the mad emote, so i threw the ??? Emote and he had me follow him and pointed at his pet cat. So then i realized what i did so i went and did the thumbs up and fast traveled away in my embarrassment.
---
Makeshift warrior on 3 so u can put demo expert on 5, and u dont need white knight all the time, put that card off and level up adrenaline with the points of white knight, thats all
---
i used to send team invites for events and such, but been that ppl were trying to trick other ppl into pvp by team invites. I stopped and now i just send them a text.
---
What's wrong with the Nuka Quantum grenades? I was planning to craft some. I already crafted some standard Nuka grenades and they did their job.
---
To be honest... I only use it to get challenges done.
---
*ok... and to impress the ladys when served together with clean fancy lads and a ash rose...*
---
I've bought it last year for 25 bucks.
---
It has become better, more stable and more content was added.
---
In the early days 3 nukes would insta crash a server, now they're fine with it Most of the time.
---
There are still Bugs, crashes and dsconnects for me, but faaaar less often.
---
Is it worth 60 bucks? I dunno...
---
Is it worth 20-35 bucks, absolutely.
---
My advice:
---
Give it a Shot and play to lvl 20-30 on your own and then connect to people ingame with a mic or here on reddit. It's one of the nicest communities i have ever experienced.
---
Don’t forget about well tuned and corn soup. Both speed up ap regeneration......
---
This is literally the only wish i have for this game. Having the possibility to look like a legit Ghoul would be a dream come true for me. 
---
A pure cosmetic atom shop purchase is all i am asking for. :-)
---
Damn look at those mooscles
---
that's called lag.
---
Ha! Try to do the tadpole quest
---
Don't forget that one in the bathtub in tanagra town while farming.
---
Yea a mic helps a Lot
---
Except if you want a melee build you want strength and endurance but if you want to make a sniper build you need perception and agility. Plus the different mutations for each of them, there are many different nuances and as the saying goes jack of all trades master of none.
---
This happened to me too. Luckily the terminals existed for my teammate.
---
Have fun! You make such a cute couple.
---
Does pacifist basically work the same, as in you don't do damage if it's on? If so, why would someone do this in Survival? Is it to avoid friendly fire if they're actually working on an event with other people?
---
I have that deathclaw "plant"  at my base so i will put a flower pot at it in memory of Steve :(...
---
Us turning into ghouls has to be the only real outcome right?
---
I might just change it to SirSnugglyGeoff or something.
---
Or something fallout related but keeping snugglyGeoff
---
Upvote!
---
I will finally put all my precious memorabilia (fasnacht porcelain beer keg, case file of sheepsquatsh etc.) into the vault shelf to make it look less sad and useless.
---
Nobody knows you're platform or IGN/GT/PSN.
---
Kind of hard to "Plug" without that info lol.
---
That's my problem as well. I made a main character specifically as a sort of healer/coop toon, and I have 160 stimpaks (using Traveling Pharm). No space for these in the stash. I remember hearing that they made changes and lowered the number of items that drop, but it was still too much for my tastes.
---
Pulled a 3-star Bloodied Gauss and 3-star Vampires Deathclaw the first day of the Purveyor. Since then I have only received combat knives, ultracite laser pistols and disgust from the RNG gods. Good luck,  They are out there!
---
Sounds potentially like your controller either has a buildup of dirt/mess in it or is faulty
---
Some vendors sell a bayonet for a black powder rifle... which fits on a dragon. I don't know which vendors offhand, but I bought one for my dragon.. it is awesome
---
Make use of the hundreds of voter booths around Appalachia and let us vote on updates? Come on guys. OSRS has a voting poll, why can’t we?
---
Sounds like they really got to you then since you made a post about it just saying
---
Nice! Is there any way to learn the plan? Or is it only available as a mod?
---
I literally haven’t seen a “this game is broke” post get upvoted but it’s ok ur just dense
---
Favorite - a small glimpse of slender man optic while Leaving PA
---
Most Hated - get stuck in that same damn hole between robco and bog town...every...friggin...time.
---
0.99$ stores incoming.
---
I guess it is good information to share, but it just didn't seem like a good place to do it since you spawn at the bottom and have to climb all the way up and go through a horde of cave crickets
---
we literally snuck and ignored the enemies except for the legendary that popped up once... thus 10 minutes
---
Tried to check your sheet you linked and it's locked, by the way.
---
Survival mode always put me in the mood to try a build someone told me about once. It was more of an RP build, one where you take the cannibal perks, and only use food and dead victims for healing. Use only fist weapons, pick up no armor (use the Barbarian and Evasive perks), and heal using only food and cannibalism. Of course, the problem is you're going to get seriously abused using only fist weapons, so that condition might have to be dropped.
---
Well I guess lvl 145 is better late than never... Goddamn
---
Human and super mutant marriage rights??
---
It's a common bug, try changing server or restarting your game, should (not definitely) remedy that
---
If you try it - and as it seems it might work - could you let us know? Thx!
---
Bulk adhesive and springs easily sell at 30-40 each, 10 is shortchanging yourself
---
I will be online later I will take it if you like GT Just junior boy
---
I'm honestly not sure of a plan, or if scrapping black powder rifles unlocks it. I know I've scrapped quite a few with no luck.
---
Nah just amused at the immature false bravado/chest puffing.
---
Check your lag dummy
---
That's more than fair! Keep it up.
---
Almost got the same prices lol
---
Swing speed is awesome :) My first Legendary Vendor RNG roll gave me a Bloodied Swing Speed 3\* Flick Knife, I am chuffed, now with adrenaline it hits 750+ damage the speed is so much fun :)
---
Lmao just add a while loop what could go wrong? 4head
---
Not gone through the drain covers yet something to know about in case it happens, cheers!
---
Really? I've been playing a lot and no junk ever sells. Hmm.
---
My favourite is the running glitch where you're sprinting but your AP doesn't go down
---
This is the exact reason I use a tesla rifle. Perfect for bugs and tagging the legendary without one shotting it. Perhaps if you spot a legendary with reduced weight pick it up as a questing weapon
---
Hmmmm idk I've had this before and never made a post about it plus I've been told adventure modes isn't for PvP to get out lol if PvP wasn't for adventure mode then they would of never implemented it plus if you don't want PvP just don't take over workshops that's were it all happens at
---
Got it from another guy. I don't know how to un-lock it for you, sorry.
---
Wait isnt it more immature to make a post about it complaining over a game
---
People who PvP in Adventure only do so because they know they'll get stomped in Survival by actual PvP players. Funny that.
---
I just want to be able to clear solo so I don't bother my friends with the grind 😰
---
Never happened to me as I don't have a microphone :D The squeakers can squeak away while I'm blissfully munching junk.
---
This is why it absolutely sucks to get an animated card of a perk you already maxed out, cause if you previously maxed it then you cannot max out the animated one as a replacement.
---
I really wish pulling an animated card just animated all your copies of that card for this reason ;/
---
I've sent people so many randoms team invites in the last week.
---
I think a common thing people don't think about is accidental things. When you go to travel to a fast travel location sometimes my inpatient ass will click it fast to get their earlier or if I'm feeling last I'll just hit enter twice on a location, unfortunately some times I accidentally invite people to my team whilst doing this (though most decline)
---
we finally got squrriels after years of having squirrel bits be an item. so I think Iguanas could have a shot at getting in because iguana bits are in the game without an animal. drops iguana skin, intestine and bits.
---
snakes could use the animations of bloodworms from nuka world without being able to burrow and could inflict only poison damage. drops fangs, intestine and meat. Fangs can be turned into a throwing weapon and meat inflicts poison if eaten raw.
---
Skunks could use the animations of beavers, or opossum they would either barely any fur like squrrels exept on their tail or extra heads like possums. can attack by spraying being sprayed lowers stealth for 20 minutes to get rid of it you have to wait until it goes away, use an item, or use a rad shower. drops skin, meat, intestine, and scent gland. skin can be turned into a hat and scent gland can be used to make stink bombs. stink bombs would create a purple cloud similar to bug/pumpkin grenades the smoke would linger longer and makes enemies run away and become confused, if used in pvp slightly messes with players vision, covers them in purple so you can see them if they are invisible and gives them a 5 minute version of the skunk spray effect.
---
Wild pigs could totally survive an apocalypse they could have giant tusks, black fur that fades around their rear section, be covered in tumors and slightly smaller than a yao guai. can bite, headbut, and use a hoof attack. They tavel in packs always 2-4 adults and 1-4 babies, babies are smaller stay at a safe distance and if the parents are killed they will loudly squeal and try and attack, their squealing can and will atract other predators or more pigs. drop hide, meat, and rarely truffles and other kinds of mushrooms. meat would have alot of recipies like porkchops, or bacon they would be a good source of food but a tough fight.
---
Sometimes it depends on other players. Generally high level players will buy bulk springs, adhesive and flux a lot .
---
You aboutta get the dicking of your lifetime I’m telling ya
---
Yeah it bugs to no end.  In order to level up an animated card,when you already have the non animated maxed,you have  to find more animated of that card.
---
Agree about that!
---
I prefer no speaking for play through videos like this, unless you're really, really good at it (most aren't). Even Osborn gets on my nerves sometimes ( "in this mysterious chem container, . . . an ominous can of purified water"). Manyatruenerd can do it well, but he's a real pro at it.
---
Sounds likely, always good to go into those on a team
---
It's funny how much you're taking this post to heart .
---
Oh no I'm talking messages, not voice haha
---
Currently at 2 accounts with 9 mules. I paid £175 for the PA edition originally. Cdkeys sell codes for £9 now... best money i ever spent was a second account. You can run both accounts pretty well at the same time, based on if you are on pc and what your specs are.
---
😂😂😂 bruh that is not true I do survival PvP all the time the reason I do it on adventure mode is to piss off people like you that feel entitled to adventure mode to yourself just cause you "don't PvP" more like you cant. Y'all cant just take over a game mode 😂
---
You'll have such beautiful babies :)
---
Some of these bugs are probably deeply rooted in the engines faults.  I don't think there's a lot that can be done about some of them, and that's why nothing's being said or done
---
Messages? Is there a chat system then, I'm over level 200 but still feel like a Fallout baby :/
---
I'm not trust me I could care less I just think its funny how reddit is just filled with people like you complaining about PvP
---
You just proved you're the very person this post is about. Ironic and amusing.
---
A level 15 sent me an invite last night. I'm level 67. She wanted me to go to the wendigo cave with her. We barreled in there twice, both got destroyed by the level 62 charred feral ghouls. She left the team, dropped a bunch of low level legendaries at my camp, and then logged off.
---
Scrip out your mules.  There's another 600 right there.
---
The leaning protectron. It walks around like it’s about to go under a limbo stick.
---
On console yeah
---
How I don't message people I can show you countless messages of people harassing me over taking there workshop its a game bruh het over it PvP is here in the game deal with it or make 100 more post about it
---
OK I'm PC... understand now.
---
someone bought my preserved pie for 10k and now I'm part of the wasteland 1%
---
That's nice :-)
---
You remind me of a guy that made a big ass deal over me using a chameleon piece😂😂😂 literally screaming on the Mic cause he couldnt see me saying ahhh watch we gonna complain to bethesda and get chameleon nerfed😂😂😂
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
oh man imagine a 3 foot tall flightless featherless owl stalking you running up behind you breaking your legs and then dragging  you off to feed to its young
---
&gt; After that they just annoy.
---
Nah, I farm them for xp if I need a new perk card or something. If I find one spawning I can kill it before it crawls out of its hole and usually another will spawn so I can kill it too. That's a battalions worth of ghoul/scorched xp in just a few seconds.
---
I totally agree... But I know I'm terrible for hoarding stuff and I'm always running out of space even with 800 stash, so I'd just use the mailbox to hold more items between characters for a while 😂🙈
---
I agree 100%.Finnish rallyenglish would be super annoying😂. Captain Noob is amazing.
---
She! But yes, 100%. Covered in fucking bloodbugs.
---
yeah i cant sprint at all sometimes. lasts quite a while sometimes. pipboy are you using the see-thru interface or the actual pipboy?? i use the see-thru and it seems fine.
---
Wavy Willards and level 3 safes for cloth.
---
wow that went sideways fast, I love reddit :)
---
Get yourself a mid level bloodied and instigating weapon. You can often find 1 stars pretty cheap if you vendor hop enough. I keep a vats crit in the chamber for reasons like this, you can take 1/3-1/2 of their hp if you have an instigating black powder weapon at low levels. Then switch over to that bloodied and go to town, they'll be down in a few seconds if you've got vats. My 105 rifle toon can 1 shot them.
---
Everyone already has one tho. Most people have multiple accounts with 25k caps. This games economy is already beyond fucked
---
Music from a different source? Are you mad?
---
that actually makes perfect sense hahah I feel dumb not thinking of that, thank you that's a way better idea than what I did
---
thats fuckn hilarious
---
Name a patch where they fixed 60 bugs that’s has never happened it’s like 5-10 small ones that don’t matter
---
Beautiful.
---
I could see doing this over a VPN  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I've got both, they're both fun. Rifleman 1 shots them with an instigating dragon, heavy can burn them alive in seconds.
---
Ahh. I think I’m starting to understand what the milk of human kindness is.
---
I'm on PC so for me makes no difference where the music comes from, all the same, I like playing with no music anyway then the ambient wasteland sounds around me are more immersive.
---
While you're at it, fix the damb gause rifle vats. Every first shot is a miss, even at 95%.
---
My very first encounter with a behemoth (that specific one actually) was exactly like that. I was under levelled and it took a while to kill him. It was a proper difficult fight. Then he went wandering apirir mode and didn't stop any loot.
---
I did get some loot but it was a while before he appeared like that.
---
I would first like to see that we can play with the same bethesda profile in all platforms tbh
---
I am fairly certain that this morning I got black powder rifle large bayonet, but wasn't able to see a mod. Maybe tomorrow I will check if indeed I can mod a rifle.
---
Yeah I found a bloodied lever action and was super happy, then I realized it was lvl 35. Still a hell of a weapon and until just recently was my main gun. Now I've got a junkies/explosive lever action that is lvl 45 and it ruins things. I hit 450 damage per bullet before I'm even in nerd rage.
---
Was it at his spawn point or where he died? I looked around the trees and bushes but maybe I missed it. I'm glad you got to loot him though.
---
It was the spawn point nowhere near where I killed him.
---
Pro tip: Scorched beast aim where you're going to go so if you just switch to the opposite direction after they fire they'll overshoot most of the time. Back when they used to spam super fast attacks in Beta I got really good at this and could dodge about 80% of the shots (which just made them shoot even faster).  
---
But simply using the dense modifier on your chest piece makes you a sonic sponge.
---
I'm really wanting both super mutants and ghouls to be a playable option in the future
---
To get a badge you must do all of the challenges. You get the backpack when you level up to Possum. To do that you have to complete the quest,wjich includes doing 3 badges and saving a player.
---
all you need is 3 to get the back pack and get promoted to possum, but in the camp they have vending machines that the only way to buy anything from them is with them badges. the samething once you have the possum rank, vending maching with mod for the backpack can only be bought with the possum badges
---
same as me
---
Just need to do three, to obtain possum rank AND the backpack. Then you’ll have to do the possum badges to obtain their badges to buy the backpack mods/plans to upgrade your new bag
---
Thanks for the answer :)
---
So I need to do all of the 9 or 11 missions from one badges? (Regarding the world challenges.)
---
This is much...
---
Pick a weapon type and stick to it.  Do not spread your perk cards thin amongst multiple weapon types.  Same thing goes for armor.  Either play with or without power armor.  Don't do both.  You totally CAN do these things, I just wouldn't recommend it because then you'll be weak in late game.  Do a search on this subreddit for similar posts as yours.  Someone has already answered you in a way better fashion than I possibly could.
---
The quest with "revive a player" is mandatory?
---
Ionized meat never spoils
---
Glowing meat has always spoiled
---
Good for a giggle lol
---
Yes, try to kill 2 birds with one stone, the swimmer badge requires you to revive a teammate in water, do that and you’ll complete both requirements
---
Good one!
---
Then you must be deaf, blind, and stupid, because you're in one, Einstein.  xD
---
Thank Atom supermutants are sterile.
---
Even if they wanted to be lazy, they could just duplicate the explosion of a standard nuka grenade but have it do more damage.
---
Thx.
---
There are multiple badges.  Each badge has multiple challenges you have to do in order to get said badge.  You can see the numbers required in the "world" section under your challenges.
---
To complete the actual quest for the backpack, you will need to complete 3 of these badges.
---
So, for example (and i'm going to use random numbers because I dont know the actual requirements), you may end up trying to do Hunter, Swimmer, and Herpetologist.  Hunter may have 11 challenges attributed to it and you'll need to do all 11 to get the actual badge.  Repeat for Swimmer and Herpetologist.
---
I have it as well. Forgot where I got it. Thanks for the reminder.
---
He's been hitting the psycho hard
---
It's called military paint.
---
Wait, what? I met the same guy and all he did was tell me to go check out some glassy cavern because there was supposed to be some awesome treasure there. He even gave me a shovel and said I needed no other equipment. What the hell dude...
---
Thanks for the answer
---
This sounds like a hell of grind.
---
I hate PvP in this game however you sir are brilliant lol
---
You just gotta love Falkreath by this time of the y....waitwaitwaithooooolup!
---
Nope fresh start
---
Semi
---
Psycho. Psycho never changes.
---
I just tank em and tag em with a tesla rifle if there's a bunch of people around, and blast em with melee and RWR if I'm alone. 
---
I feel like the loot is better when there's lots of people around, though.
---
You don't get xp, but you will get loot from kills by teammates even if you don't do damage yourself. Good for the campsite event
---
With my gatling laser, I bring 20 cores with me to a SBQ fight, and usually go home with 10 or so. 
---
I discovered this week that tagging the follow-on hordes with an optical strike beacon means when the fight is over I get to spend 20 minutes mopping up loot from the 20-30 foes the OSB tagged.
---
**"It's like going to a book club and bragging that you could outlift them."**
---
Aaaaahahahahaaaaaa lmao omg this is just hilarious. Wish i could upvote more than once.
---
That's not a good analogy at all. They are more specific than that. They usually have the events that lead to a person's death or a town collapse or thier reaction to the bombs dropping. All relevant things that when put together tell the story of what happened to WV as a whole. You would know this if you read them. 
---
Notes have always been a very large part of fallout games. 76 just emphasizes them more than the last few did. If you don't like reading why are you playing fallout?
---
Well as long as we're on the topic.. 
---
It's a little unrealistic that I can carry four full power armor frames loaded with armor pieces in my fucking hip pocket..
---
**STRONG SMASH**
---
if i go to someone's camp and see they don't have a fusion generator sometimes I'll invite them to a team, if they are trusting enough to accept I'll give them a fusion generator and anything else i think they would like.
---
then i get out of the team and go do something else.
---
but mostly because going on teams and meeting ppl is fun, nuke zones are good places to make friends, I don't have any real life friends who play this so i have to rely on inviting random ppl and using my charisma on them
---
You should be with me, I've got green stuff.
---
My controller works fine on the Xbox menu (tested), it’s just the Pip-Boy. I can still shoot weapons and stuff
---
Tyler county fairgrounds for cloth. Nyla cola cups, burger and pizza trays EVERYWHERE in the ground.
---
Actual Pip-Boy, not using any power armour
---
What stops you respecting? All different nuances can be easily transformed from x to y, with little no trouble.
---
PA pieces are level locked however If you find a PA frame take everything off it and you can wear it for the strength bonuses and extra protection.
---
I encountered one outside twin lakes in Whitesprings for the first time in a nuke zone. 
---
https://youtu.be/psLmF6CpJTY
---
Yeah I think it would be cool kind of like Hancock from fo4 in Goodneighbor.
---
Id love it; would be so sick to walk around as a ghoul, even if it was just cosmetic. I hope bethesda sees this.
---
That's awesome
---
When super mutants hold a mini gun like a bat and trying to swing it at me. Mole miners shooting me while having a melee weapon out. Also getting damaged by a ghoul after you one shot them even though their hit never connected and getting rad worms lol.
---
An epic tale to pass on to the next generation.  Get that down on holotape!
---
Yeah would be great indeed.
---
But fixing the cat bush had priority.
---
Yeah this is what happens when the game is full of 15 year old kids. I set my messages to Friends only a long time ago.
---
I got the scolding for launching a nuke when I discovered site alpha. I have not launched a nuke or even been in a silo or met the bos.
---
Not true at all it takes skill to kill in Adventure mode while in Survival it’s whoever gets the first shot off
---
I found a few blackpowder bayonet mods at vendors and stocked up; when I needed stash space and steel I started scrapping mods and I learned the plans to make a bayonet that way
---
Did so.  Checked my support ticket on the replacement as well, and no update or correspondence since January; left a message on the ticket hoping for a response.  Thanks though!!
---
This isn’t news and it’s also not allowed here
---
I'm pretty sure it's just a mod I've scrapped 15+ Dragons and haven't learned a single mod
---
Holy shit
---
Challenges, vats meele, lightning issues on consoles, floating crops, disappearing named stuff... 
---
*Pah - Gotta live with it*
---
A tiny cat bush not worth more than 100 atoms
---
**FIXITFIXFIXFIXHOTFIXASAP**
---
Doesn't really bother me. If I end up in a low levels camp I will buy stuff from them if I'm capped on my caps to help them.
---
Nice, that name fits pretty well for a medic. I really need to start a new character to try using more laser weapons.
---
Who the hell uses VATS for melee anyway? Just run up to the enemy and swing wtf?
---
This fucking community smfh
---
I'd say maybe the gilded minigun or Alien Blaster.
---
You can only have 1 of each rank. It's the ideal situation and provides flexability in your build this is by design and not broken.
---
How many levels would you have to grind to respec a character though? Plus having lots of serums in your stash for changing your build also carrying multiple sets of armor and weapons, which limits your carrying capacity for loot
---
...Post banned in 3....2....
---
Wow a glowing one. Did you get any good loot?
---
I'm not your friend guy
---
You can find it cheaper than full price. That said I purchased on release day and have loved the game I took a month break and ended up coming back the game is good.
---
Just let him... I mean BOWIE KNIFE lol
---
He's definitely been on the juice!!
---
Raise the price to 8K it'll sell
---
I made a thread for brainstorming ideas for how those would work a few days ago and it was really interesting to see how other people thought it should change the game for those who choose to go down that path. 
---
i have wanted to play as a super mutant ever since i met Fawkes in falllout 3 and i just keep getting surprised how after now four games in the series under their belt Bethesda has never even touched this idea.
---
Nuke zones sound like it.
---
Came here to say this. Let us bulk ammo!!
---
It's only in PA
---
Mine is explosive.  I use the crap out of it.
---
I picked up a two shot explosive western revolver from the purveyor a little while ago. Goes nicely with my western duster jacket. Im not optimally set up to make the best of any particular weapon type but I have 1 level of gunslinger and 1 of expert gunslinger and Im getting about 240 dmg from it atm. The energy pistols, to me,  never seem to have good damage stats but I suppose the downside of the western is that its still just a six shooter. Speed demon helps with the reload though.
---
When you use the Perk "Ghoulish" your skin should change to that of a Ghoul.
---
Rule 34
---
Legendary grinding?
---
Walking in the woods in the middle of the night and hearing the sound that the Flatwoods Monster emanates had me sp00ked
---
Can you scrap these on accident?
---
I sell duluted for 5c regular for 10c and I sell Super Stimpaks to ingame vendors because of the weight. Your prices are good.
---
Considering that every member of the factions we already have in game are corpses i don't think anything would be stopping mutie players form continuing to be in them since we are basically playing pretend with robot pals instead of actually contributing to the power and prestige of a faction.
---
Stain*
---
I would think Free Range event in the Mire (short), Project Paradise at the Arktos Lab (longer), and West Tek are all good candidates. Rifles&gt;hand guns, with the relevant rifleman perks or commando perks in perception (maybe one point in all three tiers of either of them). Tank Killer and Bloody Mess if you don't have them with as many ranks as you can afford. Even a modded out non-legendary handmade rifle will do you well in a pinch, but obviously isn't a godlike weapon. I'm level 50 and I use mine all the time.
---
Not on ps4
---
This would force everyone running a radicool bloodied melee build to be a ghoul.  I’d rather have the choice to be a super mutant
---
I also noticed this about a week back. I used the quantum grenades back during release and they had a very large explosive radius. Not sure what they were picking at that could have ruined it.
---
Now THIS would be great for 76, especially the story. With all the humans bar vault dwellers dead, and the queen acting as the common enemy, they could use this to tell a story of different races coming together. Later we could turn into ghouls, and seeing as we are all vaultys there would be less prejudice, later still we could get an alternate start as a race for more intelligent super mutants, maybe from a different lab. They could even come up with a 4th race of some kind to pad it out.
---
Destiny
---
Rad Chickens are creepy they look like a KFC 8 piece assembled itself and started haunting the wasteland
---
I'm now convinced you're like 12 now LMAO
---
If your on mobile use the 3 dots in the top right corner from the main page of the sub
---
it could easily be balanced by making ghoul players not take health damage from radiation and in fact being healed by it but in exchange as your rad count ticks up you begin to take intelligence and perception penalties until eventually when you reach the point when humans would be killed you go completely feral and "die" with no chance of being saved by a teammate.
---
+1 STR on a ranged weapon? You sure? :\
---
[Something like this =)](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/875252309641386015/439EBCDF752F69B06D095055D4373AFBE0CA7D40/)
---
Can Arktos be done solo? I thought I read somewhere that it was made for teams.
---
I rarely see nuke zones anymore. Not like I used to. I don't get online often during "peak times"; more afternoons.
---
If you're level 60 you won't hit end game for a while, so no worries. If you're looking for better weapons: keep running any event that works for your character or that you think is fun, even low-level events, and follow up on every Hoard event you can find: you make the odds remarkably better for yourself of finding a legendary ranged weapon by banking scrip and checking the Purveyor's Legendary Ranged Weapons section :~p
---
What the hell my C.A.M.P is gone I can't see it in your picture it's on top of the snake usually.
---
if we start calling it an exploit they'll fix it faster.
---
I find it hilarious the ones that used to torment adventure players are the ones getting tormented now in survival. 
---
  That makes them come to adventure to try to feel like the big bad a** again picking fights with people who don't give 2 shits about PVP.
---
 I kind of feel sorry for them, they're stuck in limbo. They aren't good enough to play in survival mode and no one to pick on in adventure mode.
---
You obviously do it because you scrubbed out of PvP.
---
I see there is a mod slot open for The Dragon. And I saw the bayonet mod somewhere.
---
Sadly I do not remember where. But I need it too. My weapon need a tuning... :)
---
People will show up usually if you start it. Helps to watch some videos of it so you can see how it works. It will annoy people if you're just there to farm legendaries though.
---
I love you food builds who hate PvP but loving treating the other portion of the community who enjoys PvP like dog shit. 
---
Like you're to scared to be aggressive with other people in the game but on Reddit you're tough? What's that about?
---
I honestly thought this was intentionally done and not a bug, as trying to hit a creature outside of your range wouldn't be possible. 
---
It's hard enough to take a flyer down even with a ranged weapon, I don't know why it would be far easier when you're stuck on the ground having to jump up and hit it with a knife. 
---
They had originally had you essentially teleporting to hit it to make up for the fact that you actually shouldn't be able to hit it which seemed a lot less logical than just no chance to hit creature out of your range of attack .
---
I know people like Melee because it's great damage if you're a minmax build type but I honestly think there should be some sort of limitations like this so those pros also have cons.
---
The perk that gives extra meat when harvesting animals works with tick blood. Most people I come accross dont know that. I use that perk with the other expected crafting ones and I get a ton of stims.
---
what platform are you on?
---
Sadly this is probably what dupers do. I just don't have the time to send a bunch of legendaries to an alt thats boring :P
---
Apparently I have found some who don't have a phone.
---
ahh i remember stone bench hunting. it spawns on graham with (probably) the same rate as domestic kitchen tables, mirror ball, radiation emitter and such. Ive seen it on him exactly once, he had two plans and i gave one to a builder friend who has no clue how lucky he is.
---
well that sucks. Never seen it in grahm's store
---
I tried a variety of apps and programs. This one seems to be the easiest and best option so far.
---
Have you ever seen how they react to stealth boys?  😂😂 People get fucking salty when they can't see you 😂
---
I scrubbed out 😂😂 okay I basically only play survival I just stopped cause it ain't fun without camp destruction it funner to make y'all rage for a good hour while I sit there laughing receiving messages adventure mode community is just as toxic as any PvP player maybe even worse dont maoe yourself the white knights of the wasteland
---
I used VPN to stream Netflix and Hulu overseas but how will it help with this setup?
---
Water will be provided btw and anyone who is not fighting will sit and watch on the bleachers or play the drums to motivate the fighters
---
They have all the skins for planters, even potted plants. Why not pottwd crops?
---
With the rope, right? I was kinda irked about that too. And it looks so good otherwise.
---
Dude yes like hella salty there ways to see people in stealth boys lol people rather j8sr complain then figure out how to counter it
---
30% more damage but 60% less food and water loss
---
Sadly no was surprised it gave star item in first place
---
Yes. The easiest are swimming, athletics and archery, although some of the photography ones are ok. The hardest part for me was arranging to meet another player so I could save them from dying in the water. Doing that ticks the box for swimming and the required saving another player in one go. Some are impossible, eg medic which requires you to make a medkit that hasn't been introduced yet, and some are really ridiculously hard. I recommend using a notebook to keep track, btw.
---
Ahh... as a pure unarmed build, I am still waiting for this day to come!
---
Ran into a couple of these jerk-offs in adventure mode a couple days ago.  I needed fusion cores so built the fusion generator because I was too lazy to power up Poseidon.  3 dudes jacked my biz.  I killed them all but they just keep re-spawning right there at the power plant which makes no fucking sense.  Wasnt worth the time or ammo spent if they just keep coming back 15 seconds later.  Should at least send you back to Vault 76 or your camp if you die trying to steal someones workshop.
---
You can also use the dense torso armor mod. I don't use fireproof and scorchbeasts don't hurt me. Scorched guys do instead.
---
as someone said in this post, apparently you have to find the rare bayonet mods in the world or at vendors, and scrap them to unlock the plan to build it
---
I shot the clothes off one yesterday. It was awful.
---
What an evil genius haha
---
RIP Steve the Deathclaw :(
---
Got a couple for 300, a few for 500.  Would never pay 4k lol.
---
Maybe that's how they keep their junk stocked in the vending machines.
---
id you find him relog with a buddy holding him. it'll still take forever. but its my fave bench in the game for the difficulty
---
I know I have no choice but to admire the design. At least if players read this they'll be aware of this trap.
---
Lol, this is why I always player vend in PA
---
*Laughs in mouse and keyboard*
---
yeah, i already hopped on him dosens of times. Never seen this bench. Thanks for the info
---
Ow the edge
---
I just put a prime receiver on my LMG and, it shreds. Was very annoyed to find myself surround by 3 while trading in legendaries in Berkeley Springs, and that gun does work.
---
Didn't get any photos, was panicking to much the first one and the second hit me once and took off. I do have a wing now though which i didn't think I'd ever do that badge because i wasn't going to attack a friendly one and had never even seen an aggressive one until yesterday.
---
Yup, no lead at Charleston Junkyard.
---
Just yesterday I was surrounded by Glowing ghouls and struggling so I put out a shout for help. A high level player comes along and just stands and watches while I get killed just so he could steal my scrap.
---
Todd called out to him.
---
Its like they don't want to have to try in PvP. Food builds refuse to learn the good tactics, counters and the metas. Then they come to the reddit "PvP iS bRoKeN fUcKiNg GrIeFeRs"
---
I dOn'T lIkE wHeRe ThIs Is GoInG...
---
If you nuke something people usually show up even when it's quite.
---
I think even a ghoul skin for your character. Like you can get different paint jobs for the Power Armour, CAMP items, poses, etc,from the atomic shop, you can get a ghoul skin or mod to alter your characters appearance.
---
how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?
---
I use Lead Champagne, Radshield and Glowing Fungus Soup, as I really don’t care to be irradiated! Not sure on the duration. Usually long enough for my purposes.  You’ve reminded me I need to collect some Tarberry and make a new batch.
---
Seriously though man what's that about?
---
I had an event quest where I had to "find the source of the Sheepsquatch horde"... i was both terrified and excited. Turns out, 'Sheepsquatch' is just another way of saying 'Scorched'.
---
This, my hideaway in the mountains is looking pretty silly right now with holes above stairs. At least it gave me a good place to run electricity up to my turrets and keep that sweet fusion generator nice and safe inside.
---
Dude exactly they don't even try to do something about it they just complain complain WAWAWA ima complain until the wasteland is a go happy hand in hand world where everyone's loves and helps each other gtfo fallout has always been about robbing killing and deciding what you wanna be good or bad not a friendly place
---
From what I gather teaming up with randos in nukezones, whitesprings etc.. is so any kill they do or you do the loot drops without either of you needing to tap it once for it to register.
---
I can't see my camp because they are not on that part of the map. Did they delete my camp from the game?
---
i guess you dont know the difference between the 2. lol
---
Why are there no female super mutants?
---
Mouse does work. Z and C just change categories across the top
---
They usd to spread out properly and were really good for room clearence
---
I find it really weird when a ghoul corpse doesn’t show a loot box and when you hit it a few times it starts walking around and through walls now you are able to loot it
---
I just started as well. Healing salve is super useful and easy to make. Save the stimpacks for emergency. Stay well fed and hydrated. Pick up and scrap everything.
---
Guess I'll scrap that one. Thanks for the input
---
Oh there are they just all identify as men
---
Double bubble?
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubble_Bubble
---
I'm not narrow mindedly focusing on a single "build" so I have a toolbox of effective responses to a number of different situations and my mood at the time. The Blade of Bastet is only one of those.
---
Man exactly! I get told on the daily that I can't role play as a raider in fallout 76. That it has no place in the lore or in the game. What?!?! This is FALLOUT like you said, it is not a friendly place where we all hold hands. It is a post apocalyptic wasteland!
---
Lucky hole and hemlock holes is the best way to do a quick farm IMO
---
Oh and you think my bloodied gear is my only toon/build? 
---
There you go making assumptions again! Classic CertainPassenger!
---
Can confirm Graham still sells them, I was chasing stone benches and the gamma gun plan for the longest time and then found them both on him at the same time about a week or so ago
---
Calculator is fucking something up. I'm sitting right now at 10% HP with my Instigating Swing Speed Deathclaw Gauntlet with extra claw, adrenal reaction, claws and twisted muscles active, no strange in numbers, no damage modifiers, 38 strength, and calculator says I have 448 dmg, while ingame the display says 680%.

Yeah other then that the outfit is perfect.
---
well, i gonna keep hunting grahm i guess
---
Yup exactly in every fallout you couldnt take a few feet without getting shot at or getting into some sort of confrontation how should this be any different either grow a pair or stay away from PvP areas they already got there camp nerfed cause ah shit its so hard to get supplies to rebuold right well isn't that basically what you do on a dauly bases is hust get supplies??
---
If you enjoy the other fallout games you will like this one.  I have been playing since release and still enjoy the game.  I have taken a break or two though.
---
Which one is supposed to come from heart of the enemy... Protective or shielded?
---
Run silos by yourself and nuke things. Silos are totally doable solo, and if you’re spec’d halfway for melee you can do the whole thing w/ an instigating or troubleshooter big melee and be fine.
---
I tend to do near-full clear (the robots respawn so not fully cleared) for each section, I don’t do the hacking / terminals / etc. I probably use less stim packs than I come in with, so leave positive (plus a mountain of junk/scrap and possibly a legendary). Then I nuke someplace (usually SBQ, sometimes the Whitespring) and hit that.
---
Yeah yeah just cuz it’s not on my map doesn’t mean it’s not on yours. Anyways I just figured visiting the places again It’s marked back on the map. Point is if this maintenance ended up unmarking some things on my map who’s to say it didn’t bring more exploits or bugs to the game that’ll hinder our enjoyment to playing
---
Explosive shotguns are still quite good. But maybe that’s just because I also use demo expert. 
---
I’ve had a 1* Anti Armor combat shotgun I’ve used since right after the beta, and I’ve recently found an exterminators explosive combat shotgun. And I keep both equipped, as they both have different uses. 
---
Long story short, you’ll sell that gun. If somebody doesn’t snatch it up immediately, eventually someone like me will come along and decide to upgrade. I’d consider it if I wasn’t saving up for serum recipes. Also if I was on Xbox.
---
With my deep pocked unyielding combat armor I can carry a lot more outside of PA than in it.
---
Actually, according to Fallout lore, in one of the games (Fallout 3?) you discover all Super Mutants started female. The males that were experimented on were never really viable and didn’t survive transformation. 
---
They all sound male because of the transformation, but all are sterile, non-sexual beings. Many have lost their memories of their past lives but in one of the Fallout games, when you listen in on their conversations, a super mutant will sometimes remark about how they “used to be a woman.”
---
I'm level 47,and just got my first a few days ago. I was stuck on ledge and couldn't run very far, but i did have my gatling laser.
---
'Evil genius' I prefer 'twat'.
---
TSE and Bloodied build users mainly call themselves “raiders” which ruins the raider title imo
---
That's hilarious. And neat. A use for voting booths and terminals.
---
If you don't PvP you should have a bunch of time left for junk collecting and farming?? 😂
---
I traveled to WS station to sell some stuff and there were a few people on there. I turned towards one of them, used the hi emote and got a thumbs down 🤷‍♀️ The middle finger would have been nice right about then.
---
Regular lvl 50 possum backpack plus radicool and 15 STR and I’m over 370
---
Listening right now
---
I read this in Liberty primes voice..
---
As a VATS commando I personally don't have much advice other than kill the scorched that they spawn asap. Specifically the "Controller" as this seems to start the countdown to force them to land.
---
Or you can do what my buddy did and invest 6 points into Perception for 1 each of the commando perks and 3x concentrated fire. He then keeps a Anti-armor / Limb Damage Tommy gun and can force them to land quickly. Not sure if your build has those points to spare but it's something to consider.
---
We are those mutated bastards. Nearly every one of us has a monkey tail.
---
Do not trade demolition expert for gunsmith. Demolitione expert does +60% more damage to explosive wealons
---
Only thing that gives me trouble in a silo is the turrets. I have trouble hitting them with melee.
---
You can do what you want it's easy to avoid players in adventure. I just want you to accept that you scrubbed out of PvP.
---
The songs you mentioned are definitely still in the game. However I did notice 'Wishing on a Star' by Bing Crosby and 'Jumpin' Jive' by Cab Calloway were previously in BETA but got removed when 76 was released.
---
you don thave to start a new character becuase off your build, im at lvl 155 and I have changed my build like 4 times already.
---
Exactly😂😂 its not like its any other fallout where junk was hard to find they got workshops now god dammit I don't have to look for hours for god dam aluminium
---
This will probably sound annoying
---
I wanna start playing again where canni find grahm?
---
I'M NOT RUNNING FROM YOU ... ok dammit just land ...seriously please I need to hit you with this hammer and my neck aches from looking up so much
---
😂😂😂 dude if you have proof of me scrubbing out please reveal it to the eyes of reddit cause I can assure you I did not and to this day will not scrubb out of PvP
---
Dude you can even buy aluminum from a vendor? You don't even have to farm in this fallout to get junk
---
Don't get me wrong, I think my LMG is super fun to use, but I can only really use it on select sponge enemies (like high level Super Mutants) because of how bad the ammo crafting economy is.
---
It just sounds more like you scrubbed out of PvP and adventure mode bruh 😂😂🔥
---
5min in and im already really enjoying it, maybe because I love fallout lore and podcasts.. Great sound effects btw, especially for your first episode.
---
But apparently not on whitepages lol
---
on the roads, usually. [There](http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-graham.jpg) is map of his routes, but in 90% of times you won't find him anyway. He's very rare
---
When the fps drops to 3 every 5 min and I die because I can't tell what Is  going on.
---
I'm surprised people buy them at all. I'll buy supers pnly and only if a good price. Diluted are so easy to make in bulk so if you are a wonky heal spam build, you'll still be buried in diluted stims.
---
They seriously move out of your inventory?
---
what the name for it on itunes and is it labeled as a podcast or music
---
Exactly dude the struggle was real before this lol I literally would go a few hours without aluminium or ballistic fiber I would pray to the wasteland gods to drop me a single spec of fiber 😂😂
---
Ohhh ok, thank you i appreciate it
---
Yeah, I sell it for free as well. I just wish that maybe I could turn a profit.
---
Oh dear... the exams!
---
Yeah I don’t get people that vend most things at the list price.  I sell almost everything significantly below “list” price unless it is a very rare drop such as a clean ranger’s outfit or a deathclaw hide.
---
This is a great point. Why do use power armor users get punished for using VATS when non PA players get to use it for free.  I use to be a VATS user but have given it up in FO76 for this reason.
---
Awesome. :) Hope you enjoy.
---
Just had a Behemoth do the ground swim thing the ghouls in whitesprings sometimes do. Was pretty funny. 
---
For convenience the blast zones not giving rads is my favorite bug.
---
As long its not propaganda for the enemis of the Brotherhood im okay with it
---
There were bug fixes in the last update?  
---
I didn't see them.
---
Yeah, I think I might, but me up today
---
Have you seen enough hentai to know?
---
It's not a big deal it happens. You scrubbed out of PvP.
---
Protective is supposed to come from the Freestates questline but it's still bugged. I've repeated the quest on multiple chars trying to get it to drop, learning all the other plans before hand, learning all the combat armor plans, same reward still drops.
---
What about that nightkin  companion from fallout New Vegas? I forget her name but she remembers her grandchildren.
---
Where is the nuke launch tape?
---
Looks good to me. Only thing that could be worth trying is Luck of the Draw in Luck (3 points) in replace of Make Shift Warrior (5 points) and Gunsmith (3 points) in intelligence. This allows you 5 points to put else where. Happy Hunting
---
That and enough shitty fanfictions to make me permanently emotionally impaired, yes.
---
I would love it if they made the enclave survivor the first ghoul. Would explain why MODUS kicked him out.
---
People keep saying "Wastelanders" is going to be NPCs. 
---
I'm hoping it's just this, allowing us to diversify the types of characters we can play and allowing for things like faction builds or other playable races.
---
Well, that mutation process affects different people differently. Fawkes from Fallout 3 is able to retain his memories and intelligence, which is unheard of and is what gets Fawkes imprisoned by the other super mutants.
---
I agree with more music but both the songs you mention are still in the game...  
---
Unless it's a regional thing? Are you in the U.S.?
---
And to clarify, everything means everything that is not nailed down. You can turn scrap into bulk on tinkerers workbench and you can sell bulks on vendors. easy way to get 1400 daily caps (which will all go for fast traveling)
---
It's a clever design. At least you know what to look for. Also PA is a must when visiting camps makes these traps obsolete.
---
Epic man I really enjoyed this first episode, on to the 2nd one now. please keep going. Do you have a patreon?
---
Nightmare Fuel
---
Could be. I was just going off memory. 
---
I’ll have to check next time I play. 
---
I wish there was a solid ‘crafting for profit’ guide. 
---
Something that broke down component value to crafted item value.
---
*Ooooooooooooooh, Shenandooooooooooooooooah*
---
But seriously, i have turned the game music off and mostly playing Fallout radios on Spotify. And when i find holotape it's even quicker to pause than using PipBoy.
---
I always forgot to check there myself. Haven’t actually seen it, just heard reports and such.
---
I have one for Simi auto, it take cobalt, steel and ultracite. It's fun but even with ammosmith and super dooper you only get 10 rounds at a time
---
😂😂😂 I like how thats you're only statement you are just waiting for me to say something that'll reinforce this post like "add me then well go at it " 😂 but im not a child and dont need to prove myself to anyone especially not somebody who's only remark is that I apparently failed on something I'm backing up 😂😂😂 that would be very stupid of me, but you continue doing you
---
What kind of world do we live in now where a supermutant can kill a damn deathclaw. 
---
I'm sad for the deathclaws, besides the one in that cave. F that guy for scaring me.
---
When RNGesus has forsaken you, sometimes it stops being fun, lol.
---
That would defiantly make hitting the daily cap easier.
---
Thank you
---
Which platform?
---
PS4
---
While Lily says she remembers her grandkids I am not certain if we can take her word. Remember that nightkin basically became addicted to using stealthboys and very often developed schizophrenic symptoms.
---
I would love that, to be honest.
---
I play solo on xbox. I really want to team up with randoms in events or to do something like a silo run... but I won't accept random invites for fear they will exploit the pvp mechanics and trash my camp. 
---
So why should anyone trust my invites in return?... they shouldn't. 
---
Only time I send an invite is when we have done something side by side and we have earned a little trust.
---
Also. Why do so few people use a mic?!
---
~~bulk?~~ joel?
---
With... what?
---
Laughed so hard at the insultogram
---
No problem! I just find them to be some of the more interesting characters in the game so I spent more time learning about them and the process to make them when reading terminals and documents and listening to their insane conversations.
---
Really like the trader super mutant in Fallout 76. He’s adorable. Like an entrepreneurial 5-year-old.
---
Man out of everything that's already in the game what I want most is a pet Mirelurk King, but I refuse to go through all the agro when he could just randomly die out of the blue.
---
 In all honesty I'd even happily throw down 1000+ atoms just to have one that would immortal/revivable, at least have something like the Brahmin thing that I can hit a button to 'fix' each time the pet gets killed. But I'd rather they just overhaul the system, possibly also adding a quest to Arktos Pharma where you can gain one rather than endless server hopping.
---
I have a full set too and the stats end up around the same as yours but I notice I die much quicker than while using other armor with much lower stats. I feel like it’s bugged or something.
---
He’s a grower!
---
I still get some people who try to shoot at me for a while. No idea why. I always wonder if they just missed the memo about slap damage being removed. That, or they're just trying to irritate me to death into shooting back. I have the patience of a saint. You go ahead and waste your ammo tho, boo.
---
They totally should remove the negative day effect. It's totally situational without it anyway, and this negative effect makes it the least popular effect in the game. A good roll can be ruined simply by having nocturnal on it.
---
Fair enough, but I do sell clothes like clown suit and hat, skull mask, etc. for about 10 caps. Mostly because there may be the odd player coming by who's never seen those before and wants to have them. 
---
It's not always about the rare stuff, some players just like to throw out what to us seems common but to others might be something new or unexpected or just a 'could be handy'. 
---
There are so many players with so many different experiences and expectations in this game it's impossible to judge what will be common to everyone.
---
I understand what you're saying though, you personally don't like jumping to a vendor and finding what you consider junk...it's just that there are lots of players who may not find it all junk, that's all.
---
Clonal babies FTW
---
I hate super mutants. I'm more interested in fog crawlers
---
4 of my rocket launchers just dissappeared yesterday after making changes in a separate part of my camp... all the wires still connect them all... hoping they spawn back in tonight... 
---
So many niggling bugs...
---
Adds it to the fact that power armor actually have a defense buff and are all missing the 60 defense of the frame.
---
Thank you! :) I spent a lot of time on production of sound.
---
You'll like Episode 2 even more...started to get into the swing of it. Brought in voice talent as well.
---
That's a decent place for xp to. All high levels. I go in there every couple days just to clean it out. Always empty in there to, people wise.
---
Hi I’d like to buy this in B U L K
---
The fog crawlers are cool, but they’re pretty limited to Far Harbor. I like the super mutants because they’re widespread and even have regional variants.
---
It's pending on iTunes...give it a few days. :) It'll be under podcasts. "CHAD: A Fallout 76 Story". Once it's up on iTunes I'll let everyone know.
---
Or just 3 points into fireproof and never worry about a scorchbeast again.
---
That is my favorite part of that episode. I loved creating the dialogue so much I'm bringing him as a companion later on. I do...it's here:  [https://www.patreon.com/fallout76chadpodcast](https://www.patreon.com/fallout76chadpodcast)
---
They sterile, not dickless
---
And you continue scrubbing out of PvP
---
This thicc boy drinks his milk of human kindness.
---
And looking to Fallout Tactics, there are separate perks specific to those species!
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂 any thing else
---
I’ll provide overwatch from the hills of the marriage is a go
---
Should be able to blow up people's camps that do this. Don't be a vendor if your a sadist and want to scam people's dropped stuff. If I see a camp like that I'm reporting the player. Creative or not I think you're just a douche.
---
I'm not your guy, man.
---
Do you even lift bro?
---
I don't like them because every combat engagement involved with them for me is uninteresting. When they do choose to use cover, their large size doesn't help, which doesn't seem to be very often. At least with Fog Crawlers, they make you play more conservative because they can hit quite hard regardless of player level. Plus I already know everything about them
---
Nope. You may now scrub out of this conversation.
---
Once you go super mutant, you never need regular humans!
---
They should allow us the option to use their voice filter when we talk on the mic. So if we're in power armor, we talk as if we were in power armor, and if we're ghouls, talk as if we are. Of course for the sake of that rping.
---
The green mandingo
---
6 at minimum so you can send a full armour set at once, else it'll be fucking tedious as hell!
---
What about virgil though?
---
I agree that aside from Behemoths the Super Mutants don’t put up much of a fight, but I find the lore surrounding them fascinating. I like them from a sociological standpoint really.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is the pure definition of a child
---
Thanks for doing this. After the previous post I dropped BC and swapped in my Bloody Mess.
---
All day protein shakes bruhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!😎 swole tool 🔧
---
I give props where props are due. You have fun reporting a player for playing the game nothing will happen to them and you're just wasting Bethesda's time.
---
Also this player was not at thier camp I doubt they were farming junk but I can't be sure. It was just a good idea finding camps like this actually makes me happy to see the creativity.
---
I'd love to see where this has been verified.
---
Excavator armor double stacking the added 100lbs.
---
I just end up playing for an hour every few days because i'm full, my stash is full and sitting around waiting for the 8 people to check my stuff on the server is boring.    1 star and 2 star I can just leave on mobs and not lose any sleep over, but I got a ton of 3 star and I sell everything for about 500 caps.
---
Not finding much motivation to play this game with all the crappy limits that are there because someone thought it would be smart to convert a single player engine into a multiplayer one, even though it can't handle it.
---
This is the pure definition of a scrub.
---
With Virgil (and maybe even Fawkes) I’d guess either Bethesda fucked up their own lore, The Institute improved the FEV Virus (why?), or there is some small chance male subjects could’ve been viable in low numbers (but I’ve seen no evidence to support that that’s the case).
---
o lawd he comin
---
Mole miner would be interesting.
---
Did anyone get the shoot a Yao guai ,raggstad, wolf with syringer for the chemist badge to work ?
---
ok well now you know not to fight back.
---
I thought it depended on the version. i.e., the west coast ones created by The Master were simply sterile, with functioning equipment. But the ones on the East Coast were asexual, with no actual equipment. 
---
I would think the WV SMs would be like the East Coast SMs. 
---
But that’s about as far down the road about Super Mutant sexuality I want to go, to be honest lol.
---
I completely understand where your coming from with that. I like the lore behind deathclaws over super mutants. Like, how they were originally supposed to be war dogs in a sense, but they never got onto the front lines, and how some of them are more intelligent then most people know, some of them enough to speak, and the rumor that a couple of hairy deathclaws joined the Brotherhood of Steel
---
Had a look at the radshield you mentioned and with just that and chemfriend i can have a extra 300 rad protection for 30min, almost a PA protection.
---
maybe we can all get PO Boxes in Grafton :)
---
In the last big datamine there was some new furniture and a bunch of new plants which will help a bit. A one tile stair piece would help everyone the most I think, even tony hawk pro skater 2 has a U shaped stair haha
---
I wondered why I was getting these...
---
I've never even heard of the "battle that never was" event. Where does that spawn? 
---
I see irrational fear at least once a day. I think Queen of the Hunt can be triggered by walking up on the cabin where you get the cryptid info
---
You're whole existence on this earth is to be a scrub
---
Well, damage wise it's better than the 10mm pistol, so no reason not to. Although I believe this was before the automatic weapon update, so I guess I was just testing it out. And it counts as an automatic rifle for perks, and my character is specced better for rifles than pistols. The 10mm smg is pretty good though, now I have a furious one and it can stand its ground against end-game enemies
---
I never would send random invites, and rarely accepted them until recently. But after picking up herd mentality mutation, I try to send out invites until I get at least one taker. I don't want to bother/team up or anything. I'm just trying to get my stats boost. I get why people ignore them though.
---
This is good advice when first stating out, much later in the game you’ll find you’ll be able to run a couple of builds on the same character, but at lower levels sticking to perks like scrapper, ammosmith, super duper, strong back are you ideal options.
---
☺️
---
The first Camp in this video NEVER has any spawns. It has a massive cliff on one side and the edge of the map on the other :)

Best pet spot for sure

Rip what your wallet could have been dude
---
NEED TO FIGHT NEED TO SMASH!
---
This reminded me of fallout tactics. Near the middle of the game you unlocked this one ghoul sniper who was absolutely amazing, pretty sure he had 10 luck. Now I REALLY want this to happen
---
As hard as I may try I will never be king of scrubs as you have taken the crown.
---
What if... when you have gotten over like 5 mutations or so you turn into a ghoul, could be cool.
---
F4 already canonizes a cure for the super mutant condition, and this game already sort of throws lore out the window anyway, so we could totally have our own unique strand of vault dweller mutants without serious repercussions
---
Yeah. Deathclaws were another cool creature that essentially was the government playing the people. They created these creatures to use in combat, never deployed them, then some escaped when the bombs fell and now terrorize the wastes. Then you have the Enclave harnessing their power against ordinary people in order to claim what’s left of civilization for themselves. 
---
Plus, yes, with sentient deathclaws existing, too, it’s a twist on the lore that makes you wonder if there was a human element to their creation process and if they were meant to all be sentient beings like that or if it’s a weird fluke in the design.
---
Kitchen....furniture?! 😍

It was removed.

I'm assuming that's the Chinese fallout shelter expansion thingy.

Sadly no :( more couches and chairs haha. The best I’ve come up with is the vanity with the punch bowl on it

I understood you're comment im not being a tool for defending what I believe is what the whole games is based upon I PvP because I enjoy it because its the core element of the franchise I do not go out of my way to bother people but I also do not believe that toxicity of people only comes one way every PvP comment on Reddit is hated upon all I stated was that people complain until things get changed some people enjoy the excitement of PvP of not knowing if there gonna get shot down in the wasteland but if me expressing my opinion is so offensive to people that you have to go out of you're way to belittle people for wanting PvP then you all may be the problem
---
Have you tried reinstalling the game?
---
 does audio come out of the tv if you don't have a headset plugged in? 
---
Does audio cone through a pc if you stream your xbox to the pc via the xbox app?
---
Can people hear the game if you are streaming through mixer? 
---
Can you try a cheap pair of headphones to see if it's the current headphones?
---
Can you record a few minutes of gameplay showing it transition from main menu to loading screen to the game and it show where the audio cuts out.

I found a really cool playlist someone made on Spotify when beta was released. It has all the music plus extra and also old times ads which are beyond cool. They were very whimsical back then. It’s called Marvin’s Mountaintop I think

It's just like the door to the tattoo shop, sometimes it takes a few minutes to load in.

Ooh, hadn't though of that. Though technically that'd be like an outfit for a human/ghoul right?
---
Used to be a Pvp/pve event at Pricketts Fort where you got to reenact a battle.
---
Okay strange cause try that queen of the hunt once a day without success.
---
yes
---
Do you by any change use a Steelseries headset? It happend here on pc last night. Installed an update for the Steelseries software. Had to install the previous version AND change usb port. Now it works fine again. 
---
I heard intro but in game only a few sounds. I ddn’t for example hear my gun fire but i heard the shells falling on the ground.
---
And from a game design standpoint... a power armored player is roughly the same size as a mutie right? So you should still fit through doors and such, but definitely not fit inside power armor.
---
You’ve made my cry. Good job asshole 😔
---
Not tried reinstalling. Guess I shall have to do that.
---
Audio comes out through tv when in the sign in menu and load screen, I get roughly 2 seconds of audio when I get into the game then I stops. When messing with the audio options, flicking between team, area and none, I get 2 seconds of audio again and then cuts out.
---
I never use headsets, so ruling headset issues out
---
I’ve never streamed my game to pc or used mixer so can’t comment - however seems a little much if I need to do that bearing in mind sound should work on my game haha
---
Speaking is fine, commenting is better, rambling is the worst.
---
Explosive Legacy weapons are basically broken. Giving all these flamer mods unlimited range and turning the damage into i believe either all or some ballistic damage as well. 
---
What you want is a regular Flamer. I would say the best flamer to use for the flame effect would be a regular Two Shot, Bloodied or maybe a Furious.
---
Haven't seen Battle that never was for months, I'm talking like before Xmas! No idea what happened to it!

Pick up and drop mode only available in camps and only for the owner. Make static so people can’t steal items or knock them over. Done.

More artwork by you please!!! Great job with this one!

nice build..
---
I run similarly but weighted more towards the rifles with less STR and more Agility + Luck..
---
[like this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7c445bd&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72a81lb0lr2l11pp1pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1s50si0sj0l71ar0pe0&amp;w=p80p90c52i30ia0ij2i42iq2at1lm2pa0p00&amp;n=&amp;m=8c)
---
nah the mole miners are a unique mutation offshoot of humans who got trapped underground during the war.
---
Legendary Quad Assaultron head is the single strongest pistol in the game. Next being the Anti-Armor Black Powder Pistol. At the moment, there is no difference using Energy or Ballistic Pistols since there is 0 armor piercing perks for them. Until you get Anti-Armor Legendarys thats where Ballistic pistols trump most energy pistols. However from a pvp perceptive most people are stacking max DR compared to ER so ER pistols might give you more bang for your buck. 
---
In general pistols are lacking since they dont have access to a stagger perk or armor-piercing perk. 
---
Just know that Pistols at the moment are the bottom of the barrel when it comes to weapons right now. I think explosive weapons come close only because of how hard they are to up keep with ammo and the fact they are mostly useless in pvp due to the fireproof perk. Both however work wonders in Vats.
---
Looks good.
---
We do know that the Institute resumed FEV testing after an extended break (presumably) once Father got his diagnosis. I assume they were looking for a cure, but they never got it right.
---
Shhhhh we dont want this fixed. I swear the other day I ran for 20 mins straight. Lol
---
What’s your GT?  Im always down to unload a bunch of caps.

Haha yah there would have to be a very specific set of things to happen for this to happen canonly. A working printing press post war, responders being violently anti communist (which they could be especially if the liberators were active early on, and considering these were mostly people that were there for the pre bomb propaganda)
---
Adorable but it looks like he might have a virus
---
I price them at regulars for 30 and they still sell.  I only put them in there so I fill up all categories to entice people to visit my shop.
---
They had some great strong art
---
I just got there with my unarmed build! Took out 10 scorchbeasts in the last couple of days in order to gain rank of general of the Enclave. It feels liberating to say the least. You’ll get there! My vampires mole miner gauntlet + Fury + Glowing Meat Steak + Nukashine makes you a monster!
---
They've already announced this is happening.
---
It was bugggged as fuck and they took it down to fix it. At least that is what I heard. I can vouch that it was bugged as fuck lol
---
Do the Collision Course event at Morgan town airport.  You get 100+ pre-war money.
---
No more green slime!!!!!
---
Why not use both BC and BM? If you have to choose only one I would highly recommend BM over BC.
---
YES!
---
What platform and how much do you need?
---
Wouldn't say nerf more like don't work. If a 3rd enemy sees you your not sneaking and I think if a player nearby isn't sneaking you get no sneak kinda like followers in fallout 4 ruining your stealth.
---
Well...that fix took a bit then hu? lol
---
I don’t use any headset.
---
I don’t get any audio in game at all, tried to do as many things as possible to narrow down what I get but it’s absolutely nothing
---
I'm not offended or bothered by pvp players. Their reaction is to people belittling them as well.  You're never going to get buy in and mutual enjoyment from people who don't want to play the same game as you.  I agree that you shouldn't claim workshops if you're not prepared to encounter pvp players.  But when people are mean, people get mean back.  Just because you don't see what you are doing as mean, doesn't mean others don't see it that way.  You did say that you specifically go into adventure mode to make pve players angry after-all.
---
I have a sound bug since the last update.  It’s sporadic tho.  I think they know about it.
---
Stealthy sneak builds do seem to be somewhat hit and miss at the moment. Sometimes I can clear an entire camp without being seen, other times I’m seen whilst crouched and still in chameleon armour 100 meters away lol. It has been mentioned on here a few times but nobody seems to know why it’s happening.
---
Sorry this is all a little vague, but I there is definitely something amiss with it at the moment.
---
100 meters is 109.36 yards
---
Favourite: A Ghoul corpse having one hand stuck to the ceiling and spinning in circles constantly. Made it look like a pole dancer.
---
Most annoying: Being on a team, but the other person not being yellow so you cant fast travel to their camp for free
---
the humans of course
---
Qoth never spawns for me. Irrational fear spawns tons.
---
Fix a bug.. Complain that bug was fixed over others and that they do not fix bogs.  Sheesh.
---
If you’ve got Marsupial, the climb is much easier.
---
Also... That cave is one of my FAVE places to mine (yay excavator!) - happy to do it and get Royal Jelly to sell in my vending machine as well!
---
Get A vampire heavy, never worry about health again!
---
Maybe if they could code the game correctly instead of rushing out this cash grab, they wouldn’t have to fix so many exploits 😂
---
I’ve only recently started playing, bought it last week. When was the last update?
---
In the hallways the jump timing is rough.
---
In the other places, you can generally hit them by just standing directly underneath them.
---
Ok so it isn't me then.  I got swarmed last night just sneaking into a building, it was crazy.  I have been noticing this since the patch and thought maybe I needed more chameleon armor and that they made changes to it.
---
Or just remove the cap limit and let the economy do what it will do.
---
The cure was specifically tailored for a particular strain of FEV. Virgil himself says it would have no effect on normal mutants. 1, 2 and NV also have intelligent super mutants, and we know stores of FEV were handed out to a load of different places for study, so its entirely possible another place near WV has a new strain. Wouldn't be too hard or lore breaking to add player mutants.
---
I use a huge fallout themed playlist on Spotify so the music doesn't get old.
---
You are doing the Lord's work.
---
Say goodbye to your human form and say hello to your new supermutant form o/
---
Fix 60, reinstate 80 😄
---
Why should we appreciate them fixing their broken product? 
---
They were very quick to take our money initially, weren’t they?
---
100% agreed, i'm in a duo party so i just merged the healer and tank but i still love the trinity
---
As you wish king scrub
---
Awesome!
---
I'm never mean I go in with my mic asking for it first then they usually start talking trash cauae of my icon. Then like you said they say mean stuff so I get mean and I said that doesnt mean I potentially just focus my whole time in doing that dont assume I dont bother low levels or anybody unless I need a material
---
Seems like a fair compromise 🤟🏻
---
I've been playing a stealth build for some months now. Ghouls have always seemed to have this thing where *sometimes*, they just to into "swarm" mode and rush at you. Only sometimes. Other times you can clear out an entire area and stay in caution all the time.
---
but we do have mmo mechanics, all of them expect an aggro skill. i can crowd control, i can heal and mobs already aim for the highest damage dealer
---
Ad victoriam brother, clean the scum away.
---
No, in this case I asked for optional overtime hours not more for the same effort.
---
This is so cute I'm crying rn 😭💕
---
I'm not sure how range works on flamers anyway. It seems to have a large range when you read the stats, but it rally is right in front of your face only.
---
Last week.  But if you’ve just started playing you are using the latest version.  All devices must run the latest version at any time to log on and play.  You’re xbox downloaded the latest version when you installed it.  I don’t think uninstalling and re-installing will work.  Are you feeding audio thru a receiver or straight to the tv?
---
On 2nd floor, outside of building with robot vendor on a white table. Table will have a blue food cooler on it as well. 
---
2nd floor, outside of building that you cannot enter, nearest to Pleasant Valley Train Station. Sitting on a table with a random alcohol and another blue food cooler.
---
Cut Throat Raider Camp (Iirc that is the name), closest one to Pleasant Valley Train Station. On 1st table to your right if you are walking away from train station, w/ random drinks/ski pole etc. . .
---
When the alternative is a fist, lets hope WV follows suit with their western kin.
---
The jetpack is also good for quickly getting out of trenches if you happen to fall into one in the bog. I also like to use mine for recon.  For example during Free Reign when you're heading up the hill to the farm.  As I near the top, I blast up into the air and trigger VATS to target any nearby enemies. This way I know if I'm going to be dealing with radtoads, mirelurk kings, or yao guai and l can plan accordingly.
---
It crafts 10 with ammo Smith, or it crafts 5 and you get 10 when super duper kicks in? And what’s the damage difference with it primed?
---
That makes a lot of sense. Would explain the intentional “mutantification” of Virgil. What they managed to do was make the FEV Virus genderfluid rather than being lethal to men. Poor choice on their part.
---
I know this bug. Happens regulary with the Ghouls in the Burrows, especially the ones right of the "throne room" at the water. The Ghouls like to moonwalk sometimes, looks great :-D And after a period of time, they just appear at some point in the surrounding area.
---
You obviously never played Fallout 2
---
I couldn't find the tourist forever.  I checked this sub one day and someone had him at Whitesprings.  Now I see the guy all the time!  Your best bet is to check here when you log in and as you play.  I usually post on here when I find him.  Good luck!
---
Ok thanks, won’t uninstall just yet....
---
I’m going straight to the TV
---
Quick update though...... got my old headset and plugged it in as people seem to be mentioning them a lot, and I have sound coming through the tv and the headset. So seems like a need the headset for the sound?
---
If I take the headset out, the sound goes away from the TV after a slight delay
---
What if Nuclear Winter brings that? Instead of the shitty BR mode that everyone expects.
---
Then I'd recover my faith in Bethesda.
---
And is it 7 steel, 1 cobalt, and 1 ultracite?  Thanks for the info.
---
Capture workshops!  You get plans, caps, experience, meds, and you can loot all the monsters.  Not to mention you can set up extractors and collect junk.
---
It does 10 with ammosmith and I think the damage is about 200, with my setup, 3 demo expert and all riflemen perks, I'll double check the numbers after work today but I think that's the damage.
---
R.I.P. Steve.  He grabbed the glory on the way to victory.
---
I have a 30 Mirelurk King that's several months old.  I found him at the South Mountain Lookout random encounter spawn IIRC.  He's extremely durable and has survived the supermutant encounters you described, without my assistance or the help of my turrets since he tends to chase them (yes, they run) out of turret line of sight.
---
There's something about kings and their enemies running from them.  Kite one into Watoga to see what I mean.
---
I’m curious what the % increase is since the overall damage is so subjective. Thanks for all the information, it’s definitely helpful.
---
Dear God plz give more music...and perhaps give rose her own talk radio station
---
I not your man champ
---
I like it. It tells me each time I long on that I’m about to embark on the GREATEST OF ADVENTURES...... but then the game starts, and shit starts bugging out. :)
---
Sorry for your loss, Fluffy sends condolences.
---
Pets should definitely have more DR than random creatures, or level along with you - even one level for every 2-3 would be helpful.
---
what they need is to fix the bug we currently have, and test the new content before it rolls out.
---
I like the idea (not my original idea, I read it some time ago) that the personal computers could be used for such surveys...
---
I roll with Barbarian in strength, Iron Clad in Endurance Obvs Lone wanderer when I'm solo, White Knight in Agility and Lucky Break in Luck. Mutations can be bought in serums from players or from Modus
---
I just want those damn corner stairs in the prefab houses.
---
There's no way that I'm aware of to change the title music. Also, "I don't want to set the world on fire" was released in 1941.
---
I'm sorry if it seemed like I was making negative assumptions about you.  I don't believe it is your intention to be mean.  Perspective is a funny thing.  There will always be people who believe that anyone picking a fight with them is acting maliciously, because some people will always see aggression as a malicious act.  That's ok, as is acting aggressively in a game.  It's just important to recognize that the other perspective is going to exist and not become angry when things don't go the way you think they should.  
---
I don't like pvp much, as I'm not a very aggressive person and I know that competition can bring out the worst in me - so when people attack my workshops, in the rare event that I have them, I just leave (or occasionally shoot them in the head).
---
I don't take workshops myself because I know that it can offend people, and I don't care to do that.
---
Thank a lot now I want that too!
---
Dont worry, your only loot was a drill and yellow cake flux anyway.
---
There is a nice hotel with a pool in Flatwoods....
---
The reason they don't let you get infinite scrip in one day is because they want to force you to log in every day so you see atomic shop popups at every login. hate on me all you want, but you know that's the reason. And it's bullshit.
---
Ahh gotcha, honestly I have not crunched the numbers and don't have any Two-Shot guns.  I do know that just putting on the Tank-Killer perk which grants anti-armor does way more damage.
---
well, like, If my carry weight does not get fixed,,, then yes I am going to have to make a new character.
---
I have 66 pounds of unusable trash in my inventory. I can carry 160 pounds. Once I grab a weapon an armor and food and water, I have 40-50 pounds of extra space left.
---
That means I can go out and roam and loot and pillage to my hearts content for like 20 minutes before I become over encumbered, and its just not fun not being able to run.
---
I changed my build from Rifle to Heavy Guns due to the excessive drain on Fusion Cores and VATS. Hopefully it changes at some point, but I dont think it's a bug.
---
Wow thanks !! But i think is really important bethesda fix it instead of players need to do a lot of steps to avoid problems
---
But thanks !!! It will be really helpfull for me !
---
If your melee you can always invest in heavy gunner or shotguns and not have to respec your perks around, just invest in the cards and swap them around when you feel the need to shoot,.. if your looking for an off spec I would suggest only investing in 1 point of each rifle man or handgun (expert, master etc)this way you get a decent bonus but  can free up more perk points in other areas like your low Luck  ( bloodied mess is beast)
---
Ok sure ! I will thanks
---
really? I always thought they made it just for fallout.
---
Sounds about right
---
The Stockholm syndrome is strong with this one.
---
Because clearly between your post and mine you’re obviously the articulate one.
---
Virgil’s less successful twin
---
GreAt !
---
Never skip leg day bruh
---
Found one last night in a deathclaw nest. I'm thinking it may have been a coincidence since, according to many posts, they seem to mostly show up in garbage piles. I think the code may drop more organics/odd junk in deathclaw than garbage though, so make sure to check those.
---
The one I found it in was the abandoned waste dump. There's one on the west side of the lake mononga plant is on. Though deathclaw island technically has one, it has no junk because it's a spawn that just looks like a nest.
---
Also check poo piles, a few can be found around fissures, there's a SB haunt in the far north east that has lots of random piles.
---
same for me. As well as Grafton dam und Clarksburg. It seems it's the same location who are bugged for most of the people....
---
Possibly it only works on a new character who has not yet discovered those locations. Any Experiences with that?
---
If you are buying your scrip legendaries aren't you just breaking even on caps at best? 
---
Not saying it's a bad thing. I basically do the same thing but have more daily time, so I farm more of my scrip legendaries, and cash out everyday rather than stash over a 3 day work period.
---
ok great. There is the answer i was searching for...
---
He's using shotguns. Enforcer in agility makes their wings crippled VERY fast. A few shots abs they land. Then they're toast.
---
Just come to my shop, I sell them for 75 caps! 100% charged!
---
Well, I just scrapped 20 black powder rifles, so I'm pretty confident you don't unlock the bayonet that way. I've also been server-hopping vendors for over an hour and not found a single Large Bayonet mod. The damn things are rarer than frog's feathers...
---
ya the devs gave up on this whole part of the game, someone higher up is asleep at the wheel. If You must go to the main menu to look at a quest You are no longer in the world.
---
Exactly. To my mind, Bloody Mess is just a necessary perk  for any build.
---
Yea I’ve been playing less and less because of all the stupid limits, stashes full (including mules), caps full, 150 scrip earned in 30-45 minutes, what now? It’s like Bethesda doesn’t want people to play their game too much so be it.
---
They could make a M13 mock-up and call it Americanmade! xD
---
Armor resistence is not all. Nothing can compare to a power armor in numbers but with the right legendaries you can have a lot of bonus and "percentage" reduction that is calculated before the damage resistance
---
Oddly enough I ended up finding one in Robco in a metal box. It’s been the only one I’ve found this whole time. Have searched nearly every container or pile I’ve come across.
---
Well or possibly 4 months until the most serious buggs are covered, if you are lucky...
---
Super Mutants were created from various facilities/strains of FEV: Mariposa, Vault 87, the Institute, and Huntersville/West-Tek.
---
There are male AND female super mutants, however, due to FEV, they lose their secondary sexual characteristics. The junk is still in the trunk, but both male and females are functionally sterile. Super Mutants are immune to some of the physiological effects of aging, but they do suffer from senility (eventually.)
---
Vault 87 Super Mutants grow larger with age, and become Behemoths. This appears to be the case with the Huntersville strain, as well.
---
Jooooonnyyyyy Guitaaaaar....
---
I have had this happen at least 6 times. Usually when a server crashes or I attempt to join someone's game through their profile.
---
The build isn't very good. Very all round and doesn't specify very much. Take out the building perks and pick locking and pick something else to do with the weapons you want to use. When your not using them perks they can be switched out for weapon perks etc.
---
Not true, I got beautiful wood legs last couple of times.
---
Exactly. Now the hacker has to have your login name (super easy), password (relatively easy to moderate with software), and your cell phone or whatever licenced hardware you are using to generate the code (much more difficult).
---
FYI! Whitesprings. Winter Springs is in WOW.
---
I understand you're point but why ruin a game just cause a few people feel that way fallout used to be fun for high levels at least we had the enjoyment of a good PvP or something but now survival is just a turret camp filled mess just because y'all complained about it why should we lose our enjoyment because of people that have a different opinion on it seem one sided to me honestly seem like its politics here the majority number change everything and others get left behind because of it if you play tje game for hours and get supplies why complain when you have to use them ?? Like seem a waste of paly8ng the game if you just accumulate materials to never use them at least with camp destruction the stash was kept in not so full
---
Now there's an idea...I've never run a shotgun build, but I remember loving using them in the early parts of the game like the forest.  Shotgun and melee sounds like a nice combo.
---
Yes to pacifist, don’t know in survival- that uranium fever situation was on Adventure
---
Hah nice. Same here, 50 hour workweek, social stuff, girlfriend, life in general. So sometimes I just log in during breakfast, sell some stuff, quickly check some vendors and stay logged in while taking a shower (so hopefully someone buys something in that time). Gives me some extra room to buy stuff for the days I do have more time ;)
---
I like hanging out with people and screwing around and I am doing my quests very slowly. But if you feel bored, take a break. Nuckear Winter drops soon, come bck then.
---
It’s more than that, they want you to play every day, and they want to stretch things out. They didn’t pull the earnrate out of the air, they know what the popular items are, they know the drop rates, they know how long they want it to take to get them, and worked back to the earn rate. 
---
But yes, the end goal is to get you to buy stuff from that store.
---
Funny thing is they gave us a daily atom challenge about it, so if they took it down they purposely stealing free atoms away then.
---
Ok cool, I'll just take the leap and give it a shot. Is it worth they g to grab the three star armour pieces that give +3 to all stars at lower health? Will this trigger on those cards giving more bonuses? Or just do the chameleon armour like everyone else?
---
Good to know. I've never done a silo mostly because of disconnects, but it seems a lot more stable now. Always figured I needed a team.
---
Do the silos still reset on a certain day each week?
---
ýou do you, 
---
but i was just trying to point out that you dont have to create a character to get the "right build" you can change your build after lvl 50, but yeah if you think starting a character is the best thing for you then do that.
---
Hold right on the d-pad. I don't think that does anything and would make sense since it's the change weapon button.
---
good question. I too trundle around in ultacite, but that suits my method of play.
---
I,m more of 'whats down this road' rather than ' ah can kill onythin mate, in wan showt'.
---
each to their own,but , I dont need all this crap to do what I like to do.
---
seen others decry cards to reduce wieght or food spoilage ????? cause the card space could be better used for better criticals or something.
---
dont have mutations tse's,sentinal this or that.................quite happy. the only thing iv'e not taken down, is the queen.
---
What?
---
(If you know this dialogue lets act it out!)
---
They need to add some of RedEye’s tunes from the future brought by some time traveling Zetans whenever they come into the game.
---
Hey,
---
We’ll bang, okay?
---
im getting tired of these posts.
---
its a free market.
---
each individual can choose how much they want to sell stuff for.  You cant choose for them.
---
If you dont like a price, dont buy it.
---
People on the market subs and on discords WILL pay 200-500% more for things than what you think they are worth...
---
you can make 1400 caps a day easily, so prices should be inflated a bit to take into account caps are basically worthless now.
---
Do flares work at all for "summoning" people if you want to do an event or some of the new content that requires teams?
---
You'd be fine with only being able to carry 94 pounds of weapons and armor and junk? I'm doing a no strength build so this is going to be my max carry weight........
---
You think that's bad, you should see the Vintage Football Outfit's clipping issues.
---
I was going to post that if no one else did.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Don%27t_Want_to_Set_the_World_on_Fire
---
Good point, haven't really thought of checking here. I do check the discord to see if someone there has him, but no luck so far and it makes me sad.
---
I got two sentinel pieces of armor the other day after 8 pieces of crap.  I was excited then realized they were both for the same leg.  Still excited to get them just hate I have to put one in my vending machine.
---
yes, of course. I just didn't want you to have to wait for an update in order to complete the challenges
---
good luck on your challenges!
---

---
You are going to want Emergency Protocols on your PA chest. Nerd Rage is pretty mandatory also.
---
If you are only running Adrenal Mutation you can free up 3 points out of Class Freak and put them somewhere else.
---
Try to keep your health at 19%. 
---
19% health = 1839 dps (using bloodied FFR gatling gun). You can still be 1 shot... but it is pretty rare
---
10% health = 1941 dps (same gun). You can and will be 1 shot quite often.
---
20% health - 1532 dps (same gun)
---
Your standard stimpack price seems low, especially considering you can get 4 diluted stimpaks from a standard one with chemist enabled. I typically list mine for 15c in my vendor and sell for 10c to 12c in person.
---
A weekly complaint, bug, and suggestion thread would cut the duplicate posts on this sub significantly.
---
Wait... Me and you or you and the super fa- excuse me super mutant?
---
People are pretty good about posting notices on here. Just sort by "new".
---
I've seen and done "Irrational Fear" every day this week.
---
I've not seen "Breach and Clear" events for a while now; it was a regular event for me for a long time.
---
It has the same affect of salt perk lvl 2
---
So 60% and it doesn’t stack with the perk.
---
Because I, a member of the Brotherhood since fallout 3, will not engage in sexual intercourse with a member of the enclave
---
I've also been playing for months and the glofclub was easy, sneak in, one shot all of the using gunfu collect, sneak out. But since the patch its, sneak in, get swarmed, survive walk out.  Something changed and sneak isn't working.  Next time I'm one I'm taking all the cards off, reequipping them and seeing if that helps.
---
i had the same problem, I found myself just playing to do the grind(sell caps, keep vending machines full, and legend), and not playing to enjoy the game or simply to have fun. I took a few days off from the game and now im enjoying it again. sometimes you just have to put it down for a while too find the joy in it again.
---
RIP
---
I haven’t put enough points to use them both. But I do plan to shift a point or two to Luck after I level up a bit more (now at 59).
---
They have a 2-3 ft wide damage area. The regular nuka grenades have a wider area than the quantum ones
---
The elastic necks that stretched from the body of a scorched to the head a mile away was pretty scary too. That bug should be back again with the next patch release the way things are going, lmfao.
---
The civil war cemetery and monument are in spitting distance of each other and both spawn points. You don't really need to server hop either, just check those two whenever you join a new server, I had it in one night of playing for a few hours just playing like I regularly do; play an hour or so on one server and if things start getting quiet join another.
---
Fair enough. Don’t really get the whole stalker thing but I think the outfit is dope.  To each their own,
---
yes i believe you, I was just surprised.
---
Don’t you ruin it for me now .. XD
---
RIP Steve. 
---
We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honored dead. And yet it should be noted that in the midst of our sorrow, this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world; a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish. He did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one, and we will not debate his profound wisdom at these proceedings. Of my friend, I can only say this: of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most... human.
---
That would've been the one to use with the level 15 trying to start something with a level 125.
---
There seems to be quite a few people in the same boat.
---
The dailies in The Mire do not trigger for us. None of them.
---
Not just QotH but also Play Time (Ms Nanny that loathes children), the bomb disposal one that Boomer gives (been so long I cannot even remember the name) etc
---
Moreover in The Savage Divide I either get Trick or Treat or nothing, I never get Waste Not or the Vox Syringer one.
---
I haven't even seen this issue 'officially' acknowledged so I am not holding my breath when it comes to expecting a fix.
---
My first one happened at Fred's BBQ, I was lvl 34. Said fuck it and fought like hell and won.
---
My most memorable was a nuked whitesprings around lvl 45ish. By this time I was a decent melee set up. Right on the road by the entrance by the station I had a sb spawn, so I went to work. Next thing I know I'm fighting 3 of them, while my attention was on them another glowing spawn came about, so before I knew it I had 3 sbs and a pack of about 10 glowies on my ass. Well before me one hitting anything in this game, I fought tooth and nail with my non legendary super sledge, at the end I was ready for a nap, the old excavator armor was broke, but I had won. Hardest fight iv had in this game.
---
I grind for gear. I do 5 runs at white spring and West Tek. 
---
I also try new builds. Right now I'm using the power fist and it's so fun
---
Not really. It works out in the long run because scrip is more valuable than money, future purchases are either either
---
A. Very valuable
---
B. Useful
---
C. 40/24 scrip at a legendary machine
---
Is 60% noticeable? Or should i just invest in good with salt 3? 8 badges is a lot for only 60%
---
Sorry for the death, that was me checking your camp.
---
When I spawned there were some communist bots attacking there and Steve did a good job, with your missile turrets.
---
Although he did gave me a scare when I spawned as the first thing I hear is explosion everywhere and first thing I see is a Deathclaw running towards me. 
---
When things calmed I went to your shop and up to third floor and soon after heard your turrets go off again. Thought some bot had survived, so went back down and saw the mutants. That's when I switched to running and took them out as fast as I could, but did not see your pet anywhere after that. 
---
They should just make the pet part of the camp, so you could repair it (blood bags anyone?).
---
About enemies scaling to your level (or the level of your visitor), that is a problem with turrets too. Highest turret level is 28 (missile) and even those have hard time to deal with half dozen level 68 enemies.
---
Before player vending I had stopped using turrets. I just build camp where there was no traffic and spawns. Now I have to have 5 turrets (I use Hvy laser turrets) to guard it because the players coming to my vendors spawn all kinds of enemies all the time.
---
I think it would be good conduct from players to clear the enemies your arrival has caused and not just ignore all the fighting outside.
---
As soon as we don't need em anymore, we'll find em everywhere lol
---
Obviously.
---
yisss, his mooscles ache
---
The thing is, if she went there by herself, she'd have a difficult time, but she may not have faced Charred Feral Ghouls.  Your presence as a Lv. 67 probably bumped them up to that top tier.
---
It's one of the unfortunate consequences of the way the game scales.  If a Level 15 is all alone in the eastern half of the map, you may actually hinder them by trying to help because you'll inadvertently shove the levels well beyond their abilities just by being there.
---
I wish the outfit was brown like the picture and not blue.
---
Solid advice, I don’t want to fell into that loop.
---
An emote that basically coveys “BAHAHAHA!”
---
Yeah, that’s kinda what another friend said, might just do that.
---
np I hope it helps.
---
Yes it has.
---
10-4.  That means the issue is a setting on the xbox and possibly the game files and has nothing to do with the tv.  
---
Two things I would try.
---
1.  Attempt a different game.  If you don’nt own one, download any free one off of Live.
---
2. There is a slim chance that your controller port where the headphones plug in may have a problem.  But if its a brand new controller I’d doubt it.  Look in the miniplug on the controller and make sure no foreign objects are in there.  Might want to blow it out with some compressed air.
---
This is really interesting thanks for the information, I'm mainly pve. I never thought an assaultron head was a pistol, I'll have to give it a try!
---
Yeah, I kind of remembered that after the first time we both died. I also remembered when I was loading inside the cave that I'd stayed away from it on principle. Wendigos freak me out. I had no idea where she wanted me to go, she just kept doing "follow" and "compass" emotes. So I did. Won't be doing that again unless I have a mic plugged in and they're in chat.
---
I know they said this is happening, that’s why I put this in discussion instead of suggestions 😁
---
Damn! You’re courageous! I would become bored in the first one.
---
Extra health. Same with the high points in Endurance. This makes it so my maximum health is higher, so when I’m under 20% health for nerd rage I have those who extra crucial hit points, without having to give up damage or as much health for bloodied or nerd rage
---
Some say yes, some say no.  Depends on what you didn't enjoy about it.
---
And no, headphones are not needed for sound to come out of the tv.
---
They're so versatile too which I found fantastic, shame they don't drop as legendaries though
---
&gt; I preordered a copy for my girlfriend and I, but didn't enjoy it very much at the time.
---
Ask your girlfriend
---
If she doesn't know then yes it has improved drastically and will continue to get better.
---
They can be gotten legendary from the purveyor.
---
Wtf
---
This is so fucking weird, why am I part of this community.
---
Getting through tadpole really isn't that much of a grind, particularly if you pick easy badges. Arguably not a grind at all since grind implies repetition. 
---
Now getting 8 possum badges (high-capacity mod), and then 8 more (Fridge) and then 5 more (armored)... THAT can be a grind because for that you probably need to repeat the dailies and the Campfire tales event.
---
I have added one to a dragon   I will check tomorrow if I have the plan or it was a one off mod
---
Rest In Peace
---
Try crafting and scrapping lever action guns. You can learn a ton of mods for just the cost of materials.
---
It's very noticeable, and is a fantastic quality of life item: if you like wild or prepared food you can replace Through Hiker and Good With Salt with one bag
---
Yeah i want board games for my game table, ashtrays for my kitchen, a typewriter for my desk, maybe cues and balls for my pool table.
---
Indeed 😄
---
Stimpack diffusers weren't in the game when the Pioneer scouts released, but they were introduced in the Arktos Pharma event. I've seen the diffusers in player vending shops since.   
---
Rather than a notebook, multiple redditors made checklists for the tasks for every badge. Search the subreddit.
---
Poor buddy. RIP, Steve. 😥
---
That sort of funny cause breach and clear pops up for me daily. Exact the opposite
---
Oh it reduces the weight as well? I was not aware.
---
Xbox One here.
---
Adding to keep this issue alive. Exact same boat for me since I believe patch 7. No Queen, no Play Time, no Bomb Disposal. Savage Divide is always Trick or Treat.
---
Jumping around to different areas in the Mire does nothing. Manually going to quest givers/terminal does nothing. Re-installation and clearing cache does nothing. I even made an alt and went as quick as I could to the Mire and did all three Mire daily starters because some said that fixes, it did not in my case.
---
I ran multiple tickets on it on Beth's bug system, did all their suggestions (which amounted to rebooting, reinstalling and clearing cache) and it all ended with Beth saying to do a general bug report and nothing heard since.
---
Its been so long I forget what unique rewards you can get from those dailies. I think the casual underarmour lining, which I've been stuck at rank 3 for.
---
The bloody mess-gibbed rad toads are the worst. Trypophobia nightmare.
---
This...this changes everything
---
I don't even want a large transfer, 50 lbs is good for me, I just wanna be able to put certain weapons onto my main character from my other one
---
RIP Steve, you will be missed
---
I remember Steve fondly... Screaming at me, tossing rocks, but in a way that didn't hurt me. Sometimes I felt he forgot I was friendly, or perhaps he just wanted to play in his Alpha predator way. It's too bad a few green-skins decided to do a protracted walk-by shooting because they could smell a fusion generator from 6 miles away. 
---
It may not be much but I went and shot up their home in West-tek for you! I scripped all the legendaries in your honor!
---
 I hope you are gnawing some tasty bones in whatever heaven/hell death claws come from.
---
I would appreciate that. :)
---
Nostalgia is dangerous.  There are good things about the past but it's dangerous to get caught up in them, because it will make us miserable.  Metas change and people adapt.   Perhaps the reason things changed is because while a few were having fun the rest felt that the high levels enjoying pvp were ruining *their* game.  Survival is still in BETA, but the plan is that eventually it will be a solid PVP environment.  Bethesda listens to what people say in this sub if enough people get on board.  If you want to change how things work, speak up and get people on your side.  I can tell you now though, that you won't convince people by getting mad at the people you disagree with.
---
there's mine spots around there
---
Please please I accidentally sold my veil and would like to get it back. :(
---
If you need help I could join you? Always happy to help a newbie out.
---
That's sounds pretty familar to my  own experiences lately. Sort of good to know i'm not alone then - thx and maybe we get a fix someday although i'm with you about expectations.
---
Just look at the common spawns.  The picnic tables by the Giant Tea pot, the parking lot at Wavy Willard's, the railing at the top of Landview Lighthouse, etc.  It's really not that hard once you get an idea of where it has spawned for others, like the Trick-or-Treaters or the Civil War Reenactors.
---
You got it. I've been posting bestiary pages in the imaginaryfallout and fo76filthycasuals subredits every friday as well! Also on my deviant art; https://www.deviantart.com/drunkfu
---
I look for plans I don't know and cheap gear I can personally use or flip.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bpnk0s/i_think_people_are_missing_the_best_part_of_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
I got somersault legendary that scrappable too and it doesn't list the legendary effects.
---
I have 2 characters that bounce between still hunting for the perfect gear for them, a bloody heavy build as my main, and explosive shotgunner alt (still trying to optimize). Trying to buy all the plans from the vendors starting with those fancy mutation serum plans with my main, got 3 so far with number 4 coming soon. 
---
Both have explosive harpoon guns, which are just fun guns to play around with especially with the flechette mod. 
---
And i still enjoy nuking the queen,  though if she still dropped those serum recipes, I'd probably have them all by now.
---
tagging /u/deata: Don't want you to miss out since it's your story!  Maybe we'll see lots of Steve memorials.
---
Ah that sucks I heard it last longer than good with salt 3 perks
---
Plans and ammo if I'm light on materials
---
Something to add to the Royal Honey spawn map is Deathclaw Hide, if there are any above world spawns.  It seems that Deathclaws no longer drop hide.  I have only ever found deathclaw hide in containers since the Pioneer Scout update
---
Steve will remain in all of our hearts.
---
Thank you :)
---
  I used to run and hide as well.  Made L51 up at the cave just S of the pupkin house.   Heard a commotion, saw an L50 SB on the ground fighting a L42 glowing deathclaw.  (the SB won).  When that fight was over, I decided F-it, and took a couple potshots.
---
  Used an executions combat rifle.  Fireproof 1, incomplete set of T60 PA.  I ducked into the cave for cover during the sonic attacks.  Cave also makes it easier to deal with the scorched, as they only come at you from the cave entrance.
---
  Took me about 200 shots to take out the SB and the accompanying scorched.
---
  While celebrating that victory, picture taking, etc, another one flew over and immediately attacked.  Back to the cave and repeat cycle.
---
  Was glad I had well over 1k rounds at the time, b/c by the time I made it from the cave to the pumpkin house, I had taken down 4 of them.
---
After that experience, no longer afraid to fight them.
---
Plans I don't know, outfits I don't have, and junk I may need. I also look for low level weapons and armor, mainly one or two star stuff for cheap so I can gift them out to low level players.
---
Alcohol.
---
[Duck and cover!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKqXu-5jw60)

---
Yeah, I know of most places where it spawns (including those), and I check them pretty much every time I play, but the rng gods are just against me I guess.
---
congrots on your first.  May it be just the first of many :)
---
Plans at this point. I'm just trying to find ones I don't know and occasionally I'll find some really good deals on them.
---
Plans I don't know, outfits, PA mods, decent legendaries
---
Woo-hoo another one of these threads!
---
Most mobs in the game have a higher ER than DR, so you are doing less damage out the gate with an energy based pistol.
---
AA legendary is broken on energy weapons as well and does not work.
---
Fusion Cells do not fall under the bandolier perk (reduced ammo weight), so you are forced to either deal with it, or spend more points into INT to compensate.
---
You are also cutting yourself off at the knees with future drops because you are effectively saying no to 6(?) different pistol types. That is a lot of legendaries to say no to.
---
@greensoup2hot is correct in that pistols are the weakest weapon type in the game right now, and has been since launch. High rof combined with low dps and no armor pen makes for an unhappy player post level 50 or so.
---
I stuck with it until level 90. Couldn't do it anymore.
---
Best ways are to kill mole miners and scrap their suits and you can also farm scraps from deathclaws. There is also a workshop that has a node - the gorge junkyard but I've found between server disconnects and people taking it from you it's really not worth it - try server hopping deathclaw island or going to blackwater mine.
---
This is incredible! Thank you so much for posting.  Would you be comfortable letting us post this on our official channels? We would absolutely credit/source wherever your preference is.
---
let us plant the seed right into Harold's head lol
---
I’ve looked at many a build for a bloodied rifleman. And they all say the build is no longer working, and it’s weak? So I’m very confused and wondering whether I should just respec into automatic rifles.
---
I’ve played every single Fallout, over the past 20+ years. 
---
There’s a difference between West Coast and East Coast Super Mutants. 
---
WC SMs are simply sterile. 
---
EC SMs are genderless.
---
I played PA only to level 130 (now at 185). Then wanted to try stealth approach and chose my hoarded Vanguard combat armor pieces. Many of them are Sentinel ones that give 75% chance for 15% reduction in damage (I think I have three of those at the moment), I also have one that gives Chameleon for the invisiblity look, one that increases AP regen and several of them reduce weight of weapons or ammo.
---
It is hard to find the pieces that suit you, but they can be found eventually.
---
For perks I don't use DR giving perks as I have better things to spend those points. I do use Blocker-3 and that is instant 45% reduction in melee damage and Lone wanderer-3 for general damage reduction.
---
My DR with the armored backpack is 390 (if remember correctly) but those legendary effects give me 75% chance for 45% reduction before armor. 
---
All those combined I can withstand a lot of punishment when standing still and not getting staggered. I usually don't even have to use stimpaks, unless there are lots of ranged enemies or I'm fighting Sheepsquatches.
---
Kill mole miners where uranium fever is.  Scrap their loot. Or mine at gorge junkyard workshop

Depends on the day really. I am always on the hunt for the few plans I don't know but sometimes I'm looking for rare clothes or weapons for my friends or sometimes trying to find serums on the cheap\~
---
I’ve had that same thing happen to me on a frequent basis when I made a new character with the intent to only play survival and kinda made me not wanna play it anymore unfortunately
---
Killing mole miners in the Ash heap and scrapping the junk you loot off them would be the fastest way.
---
Survival would be way more fun with either no legendaries at all or if they made it so you had to make a new character and get all your gear within survival instead of people being able to farm for stuff in adventure
---
awesome thank you friend :)
---
Losing the violet....bummer
---
Upside is you have lots to drink now :)
---
I use a AA/E with 90% reduced weight.  Use it only to kill SBQ and it is awesome.  Thinking about putting a prime receiver on it to bump it up a bit.  I also have a TSE Gatling and a TSE lever action but the AAE 50 cal is best for the SBQ.
---
It looks good, I use a very similar build myself. Only perk I find really useful that you don't have is tenderizer. It adds more damage on consecutive hits and with heavy guns it usually takes more than one hit to kill. You have all the necessary perks for damage and weight reduction and the mutations look good
---
Mole miners drop items that can be scrapped into black titanium and death claws do it as well. There is also a workshop that has a node you can farm, the junkyard in the forest
---
Love it!!
---
I wouldn’t worry too greatly about what the Level Guide suggests at this point because you’re better off not following it religiously. Much like a compass, it can only point you in the direction of your destination.
---
As for your perk choices, there are a number of inefficiencies you will eventually have to contend with. Some of these are related to carry capacity, others to exploration and camp construction, and others are important to your damage potential. These are all fine perks to have when starting out and they are all very helpful. But, my recommendation is to throw out the notion of a “build” or a static character set-up. Many perks (like Hard Bargain, Picklock, Armorer, or Pack Rat, etc) simply do not merit constant use and should only be used to meet certain situations once you’ve reached a decent amount of versatility in your collection of perk cards. Swap them in and out as needs demand.
---
Those perks in Charisma, for instance, might be better as Lone Wanderer or Tenderizer. And the home defense perks on a Rifleman/Commando are far less useful than Escape Artist or Action Boy. 
---
Take care to calculate when your character is receiving diminished returns— for example, you are spending 6 perk points for +40% damage in Level 3 Commando &amp; Expert Commando when you could spend just 3 perk points for +30% on Level 1 Commando, Expert, &amp; Master.
---
I could ramble on awhile but I should say this: this game is exceedingly forgiving. No matter what your perks are you can find success, so don’t sweat building the perfect deck. There is a multitude of permutations and all of them work to some degree.
---
I know we've all been wanting a sorry emote for a while.
---
People who want to crit...? Also, some creatures have unusual hitboxes and VATS can fix that AND allow you to speed towards it to hit it. VATS is what makes Fallout Fallout. It should work.
---
Plans mainly. I do look for mats and ammo that are cheap if i'm low or not easily achievable.
---
Hey u/imcoveredinbeeees (hopefully I got the correct number of Es - great username btw),

This is currently on our [Known Issues list](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language%5B%5D=en) to be addressed in the next update.

&gt;**Melee attacks in VATS can have a 0% chance to hit flying enemies.**

&gt;**STATUS:** We're currently planning to address this in our next update. 
---
The only one who needs to have a word with themselves is the one who’s wasting their life obsessively spamming the same comment on Reddit every day. Good luck, dude. Hope things get better for you soon.
---
i didn't know they'd been added. What do they do? I used a notebook to make a checklist, it works fine.
---
My friend kept unstable flux in his for a couple of days before it spoiled - seemed pretty good to me
---
I buy when I see normal stims at 10 or lower
---
That looks amazing!  I love your artwork.  Every piece is so detailed and well thought out.  Keep them coming.
---
Running without PA is all about getting lucky and stacking the right legendary effects. Without some godly luck you're unlikely to get enough mitigation effects on the right pieces and Bethesda has already started balancing those effects. If you're running regular armor it's for the other possible buffs you can stack, I personally have 100% fall damage mitigation, several chances at auto reviving, huge boosts to my specials and enough ap regen to choke a horse.
---
Absolutely. Consumers have just been so inundated with shoddy/unfinished games for long enough that it is all becoming normalized, which is a tragedy. Now it is at the point where one can simply call out an unpolished product and many will rebuke that saying, 'oh you're just cynical'. Don't stop calling it like it is pal!

I got stuck in danger the other day even when nothing was around and had to reset my game because I lost all stealth
---
Got a QE +critfill pipe pistol off the Purveyor. The gun is a hoot and a half on my pistol-packing mama. If only I knew it was loaded.
---
As for leveling I went melee until I got all my perks set. Shotguns would be fine but at lower level you might have issues with getting enough shells to use. At least with melee you don't have to worry about ammo
---
Always mole miners in Welch. :)
---
RIP Steve - Long may you reign.
---
I thought I read elsewhere on here if the WS nuke covers the fissure....there's violet there?
---
I got chills bro.  Chills.
---
Yes. Basic communication.  Pointing, yes and no. But neutral yes and no.  And sorry would also go a long way.  I also don’t use a mic.
---
Again if you're obsessing over my profile and stalking me then that is your problem, i don't know who you think you are but you don't get to dictate to me.
---
There is a mining map vendor that sells three maps at a 100 caps each that nets some
---
plans, weapons, ballistic fiber(reasonably priced), armor..
---
I just want to know how people run out. I've never focus farmed them and I'm sitting on 1000 regular stims and 400+ super stims on my mule.
---
Thanks, I'll definitely have a look over it.
---
I'm not mad and I do post about it but PvP things rarely get upvoted they just get bashed on
---
Solid. You won't really need power patcher slotted for combat as your armour is incredibly durable already.
---
I play two different characters - I have my main and then my friends and I all have low levels that we take turns helping each other level and just hanging out and screwing around. Don't take anything too serious.
---
Level 345..sounds like a winner
---
What I do is run shotgun perks with the unarmed perk, (I have 15 in Str ) , if any enemy’s gets close enough after being shot I swap to school real quick and the fight is over , Enforcer in agility is a great shotgun perk , also Skeet-shooter in perception
---
Do you want an even more broken pvp experience? Because that's how you get an even more broken pvp experience.
---
Uranium fever
---
Coal is used for serums.
---
They don't want to punish players who can't play as long or as well, while also giving you a reason to log in daily.
---
They've tried adding cap sinks like Encryptid but it's hard to get people to buy the cards to do it successfully.
---
Strangers in a strange land
---
It sounds really pointless..I mean who doesn't have good with salt maxed?
---
But it don't matter I just got bashed on in this tread too but hey its fine as long as its a group of people with the same ideals right old ways you say
---
Good to know thanks. I can swap it for batteries in that case. Or maybe demo expert if i get an explosive weapon.
---
My other games work, COD and far cry 5. No headset plugged in for them.
---
Brand new controller, and port looks fine.
---
I think I’m gunna do a reinstall overnight and see if that sorts it.
---
Thanks for your help!
---
I would like it if the daily limit became a weekly limit.
---
Yes, the Shielded Lining for the Casual Underarmor should be linked to:
---
\- Bomb Disposal
---
\- Queen of the Hunt
---
\- Waste Not
---
\- Irrational Fear
---
However the levelled list that contains this plan as a possible reward is only referenced by Queen of the Hunt. The other three they do not seem to reference it at all which would make it impossible to get it to drop as a reward.
---
If someone with more in-depth knowledge would like to have a look the relevant FormID for the levelled list is:
---
LLS\_Recipe\_Mod\_UnderArmor\_Casual\_Mk5\_Chance \[LVLI:003D6542\]
---
NUKA COLA! Those nades are keeping me alive right now 😄
---
Oh sweet summer child.
---
Tbh I think the scorched are all females so are the ghouls.
---
Not yet.
---
I saw Irrational Fear the other day but I've never even heard of the battle that never was o-o
---
♫ Too hot in the hot tub-ah! Burnt myself-ah! ♫
---
yep any of the miner suit scraps will give Black Titanium when scrapped. I was able to get plenty of it pretty quick when i ran out for the last 2 or three pieces of the excavator armor. 10 needed for each power armor piece. :(
---
Plans I don't know, lead scrap, ultracite scrap, Weapons with bloodied / AA / furious / junkies + 10% aim / explosive / 25% fire rate / vats crit at low prices, armor with Vanguard / Uny / Bolstering / Chameleon / Assassin + anything + sent or cav, heavy weapons bobbleheads, scrapping magazines, heavy weapons / ballistic damage magazines, disease cures for very cheap, psychotats for 20c each or less.
---
I’m not, seriously.
---
Like I said, I don’t even have or want to do a super dmg build, enemies fall apart as is, so I don’t really see a point.
---
My friend is close to 200, but I might try to find some fun in venturing or something.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Taking you out for dinner, no doubt
---
Cheap plans and recipes I don't know
---
Cheap glowing mask, garden mask and high radiation fluids
---
Weapons and armor to use or burn for scrip
---
Hey, thank you for your reply! Can you tell if this feature is planned or not?
---
OP, I'm in exactly the same boat.  I've quit playing after lvl 50 with all the gear I wanted, but refuse to grind bullet-sponge mobs for the rest of my life to keep leveling in '76.  I started a new character and immediately thought "ugh, I'm not going through *this* again!".
---
This is from a guy who has 1000+ hours in Fallout 4 and still fire it up occasionally.
---
Evidently the game resonates with some folks, but I'd rather jam my eyes out with an ice pick than hit the hundreds like so many.  Just too many other games out there to experience.
---
What do you do for work? In Portugal oficcial work hours are arround 8 per day.... but most people do 10... 5 days a week... I would not mind to do 12 hours 3 days a week and get two extra rest days....
---
Didn't you just get Steve yesterday? Lol.
---
And the worst part is that pets health wont regenerate until you leave the server.. so if you stay in a server for a long time its bound to happen that something finishes your pet off :/
---
How clever!
---
My CAMP is near by this has been happening to me for about two weeks now
---
I don’t, but then again it doesn’t fit in my build nor do I eat prepared food. Canned goods is where it’s at for me
---
we might have to steal this line for the bestiary.
---
You lose the Workshop
---
You loose it.
---
That's definitely not worth reporting - that makes you a douche.
---
I want to play as the Nightkin from that mod in Fallout 4 that buffs the SMs. Nightkins are bad ass
---
U lose it im guessing
---
Bc d s
---
Okay, thanks. That’s what I assumed. Guess I’m gonna afk for a bit
---
Tamed Steve, went to bed and the next time i fired up fo76 it was dead within 5 minutes :(
---
Yeah bear arms and batteries included are the only two reducers I use. Ballistic ammo is very light anyway and when you put calibrated shocks in your armour weight won't be an issue. I'm currently carrying 15 weapons and 60ish fusion cores and have no issues.
---
Well for the Encryptid if the loot is anything better than wood legs and drills, people will be all over it, including myself. For a couple of times the loot was suddenly good, like three star armors and weapons, that lasted a week maybe. Apparently they quickly fixed it so it’s back to wood pieces. Why would anyone wasted thousands of caps and rounds and stimpaks for a piece of wood...
---
Yeah I'm getting close to 200 on my main and some days I'm just like there's nothing to do with her right now and so I just switch to my low level &lt;3 I don't have a real camp on my main because it's dedicated to my pet and I don't want people going to it so I built a really nice camp for my low level :D
---
Wow. You're... something.
---
You do you, man. Speaking of swinging "epeen"...
---
Tenderizer seems prety damn good. Easy fix. Perception down to 3. Charisma up by one. 1 point for a 5% increase. Nice
---
I've been using the Quantum grenades but they are terrible, same with the MIRV.  Might switch to Nuka grenades myself
---
Duped weapons.
---
I always play them until well tuned. I’ve hit every spot with instruments to see if it was location or the instrument.  It’s just the instruments not registering you played them.  Rusty pick. Nukashine   None of the site challenges work either for playing.   Oh well.
---
Problem is that then there is a chance that the pet will spawn on the edge and die off fall damage
---
get rid of all your crafting cards, super duper, ammo smith, etc. There is just no room in a final build for them.  They will need to be swapped out at camp.  You still need them, but they wont be in your "Battle Deck"
---
I would also ditch power patcher the same way, just for camp. unless you run ultracite you dont need it full time, gunsmith is also good at 2\* in the field paired with a 1\* luck of draw.
---
traveling pharmacy and thru hiker are also good for weight reduction, as you cant use weight reduction legendary armors in PA
---
I run out of my vendor caps by running either Uranium Fever or SBQ and cooking and Super Dupering all of the meat that drops.
---
It would be interesting if getting mutations, either specific ones or combinations of existing ones, altered how your character looks.  For example, if you have Scaly Skin and Unstable Isotope, you start looking ghoulish.  Or if you have Carnivore, Twisted Muscles, and Adrenal Reaction, you start getting big and green.  Or maybe just have that kick in at a certain threshold number of mutations.
---
You could even have combinations that unlock different, new appearances.   Insectoid, reptillian, alien...
---
I work in a hospital.  It's better for patients and staff burnout to work twelve hour days. Hospitals are notoriously under staffed,  and it's easier to only offer 2 shifts since we must maintain a 24 hour operation.
---
Why would you need two rank 3 EMT cards?
---
You have a perfect scenario there; one of each rank. Just use whichever one you can soar the slot points for.
---
Great, i can tweak the leveling guide i made for myself.
---
This feedback is great, so cool to see how differently everyone plays the game
---
This is actually a pretty good method..but for me personally..I think I'm done farming legendaries..it's so frustrating taking down a 3 star when u get a one star or a terrible loot drop..the thing is.. is that essentially..the purveyor is just a slot machine.. so if u are purchasing legendaries to feed the machine..u might get something good or u might just be throwing it back into the machine..with my playstyle..I am usually too busy to be going from camp to camp to check out inventory..I also realized that it's much easier to farm caps and then buy what u want in the market subs..I'm trying my best to just max out the legendary scrip (I believe it's 1000) and then take my trip to the casino..I mean purveyor
---
It seems like the lvl 21 deathclaw is a bit power resistant to damage then a regular lvl 21 deathclaw but the issue is that when it comes to lvl 68 supermutants that little bit more DR that it has wont really matter..
---
Yep, and completely different than game servers for an always online 24-7 worldwide game.
---
I want this so bad! Please also put it on the LMG!
---
It's a live game so there's always a chance.
---
Post on the forums and post here but make it an interesting post and people will upvote and comment on it.
---
There have been several community originated things come to the game and more that are on the board to come to the game.
---
Just give them ideas. It's in there best interest to keep the player base engaged and happy.
---
Best of luck.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel would like to know your location.
---
it remains "as is" for a while... and someone else can take it over, while paying a higher cap cost than a "non upgraded" workshop.
---
Might want to mix 1/2* bear arms with 1/2* bandolier if you'll be using a 50 cal weapon. 5mm isn't too bad without that perk (10lbs per 10K), but 10K 50 cal is 50lbs.
---
Melee would be better than shotguns for leveling due to no ammo usage and 3* Incisior + 1* in each damage perk makes them ridiculous.
---
Here is my personal build that is a mix of quality of life perks and damage: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f374e3a&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s01sb0sw2pq1p10ep1c71cr0e52e10e40id0ip2ib4ic4a72lt1ls2lu2l71&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=   I use an AA gatling gun, TS 50 cal with 90% weight reduction, and a TS auto grenade launcher with 90% weight reduction. (Currently testing that vaccinated perk, it doesn't seem to actually work.)
---
They are quite good!
---
Best emote ever!! There are so many a-holes running around being dicks it would be fitting!I wish there was one on Reddit for all the armchair trolls.
---
Oops, you're right it's been quite a while since I've taken over that place. Must have confused the aluminum deposit with lead.
---
STEVE! STEVE! STEVE! STEVE! "Steve is dead dude". ALAN! ALAN! ALAN! ALAN! what to soon? RIP
---
Yeah so the backpack serves no purpose for u at all
---
I just have 5 in Luck  and I am mutated so I prefer the backpack cauz I can’t use the perk
---
But I mean I won’t be able to just log off and then come back in like an hour and just collect my resources right?
---
Thats what I keep hearing, plus regular Nuka Cola is SO much easier to find than Quantum
---
Just remember that people can claim it off of you, so if you do go afk it might not still be yours when you get back
---
Perhaps it did it before and I hadn't noticed, but after patch 9 - 
---
in certain areas, I can hear heavy breathing.
---
First time I heard it, I though there was another player around with area chat active...but nothing was indicating another player.
---
Still, the heavy breathing continued...down the hall, still heavy breathing...around a corner...Wendigo attack!
---
Plans.
---
and, occasionally, if I *need* it... ammo.
---
maybe a sweet outfit, if it fits the character, and the price is right.
---
Just one of those things where we all wonder does Bethesda hate money?
---
Like seriously, i'm pretty sure ALOT of people would pay good amount of atoms for a pet that either stays in camp or follows you (Cosmetic of course so no combat advantage)
---
Yeah, it works great. I only use one point as well. Not really worth spending two more points for 1% increases
---
And that awesome 👌
---
And again, for the 50th time, nobody is obsessing over you.
---
I’m gonna watch it just gonna be doing some other stuff at the same time
---
I started shooting a DC at someone’s house thinking it was attacking it. Once I realized it was tame (it showed as red) I stopped and apologized to the pet DC.
---
Plain text passwords are very insecure. If your system is shared or compromised you really risk losing your account
---
You meet Marcus in FO2 (and then again in FO:NV), and he is/was male.  Melchior in FO2 was also male, and there are male recruits in FO:Tactics.  The processes and results might have been different between Mariposa and the east coast, but there have always been super mutants who used to be male humans.
---
There is no other proper reaction to this then.. Oof
---
I'll be back home in 30 min and I'll share my hybrid vats/ranged/mutations build with you. It served me well so far
---
Is it the Excavator's map, Miner's or the Prospectors?
---
Gotcha..I guess the +carry weight comes in handy..I cook so much food and my character(s) are hungry all the time
---
I’m in the same situation, my friend.
---
^This, and when you go feral a max level feral ghoul will spawn on your corpse, and it has your junk on it.
---
It's probably not great for business by the seller but this wouldn't stop me from buying the right item. Repair kits have made weapon maintenance trivial.
---
They really need to fix that. It makes those perks not worth it at all. I am sorry for your loss. I know within that 24 hour period you became very close.
---
At least 1 a day........smh
---
Damn! Sounds cool!
---
Tbh the sweet spot of this game is somewhere lvl 20 and 50, after that becomes increasingly boring.
---
But hey, to each his own!
---
Yeah you just happened to stumble on this thread and pick out my comment, post reply after reply including lies and petty insults, desperately trying to pick fight...
---
I placed them there to remember to take them. They are classified as swap cards and are not part of the main battle build that i will be using when running around.
---
Power parcher i will throw out. Others have said that the armor is durable enough. Will replace with batteries for sure.
---
Hopefully we can both get something out of this topic, then.
---
 If you're not going to make a new character then I can't recommend The Fixer enough. The quest to get it isn't too hard, and the gun hits waaaaaaay above its weight.
---
I try to do one of two things before logging off. Either store everything, so the next person to take it gets undamaged workshop items. Or send random team invites to everyone on the map. Once someone accepts I log out. They inherit all my workshops.
---
The codes reset on Monday, but usually someone has them cracked by Tuesday. I've decoded once myself, but others have it cracked faster.
---
I tend to do Charlie, only because of habit.
---
I would suggest Bullet shield and I would also drop Int to 9 or 10. I use big guns and gunsmith is not needed for durability. Just have it for crafting. I feel like all the weight reducing perks are situational. I run with bandolier bc I have 10k ammo each for 3 guns. Ammosmith and Super duper are must haves in my opinion for all ammo crafting. West tek will be your friend for steel and Lucky hole mine for lead. Gatling gun is a great weapon to run around with. Queen fight prime 50. Cal, prime gatling plasma and prime lmg (if you take the time to craft the ammo? If you run low health, emergency protocols and calibrated shocks for PA. I would also suggest Nerd Rage.
---
No. You need to stay active and in world.
---
I appreciate that, thanks!
---
Okay thanks
---
Improved?  Depends what you're looking for.  Combat is as terrible as it ever was.  Hit boxes are a wild guess, you still can't hit the side of a barn in third person and the mobs are the worst bullet sponges of any game I've ever played.  (example - a Stuper Mutant *half* my level still taking 3 or 4 head shots from my lvl 50 sniper rifle - is a joke)
---
That's kind of my biggest gripe with the game, but it's so very fundamental to game play that it ruins it for me.  I'm forced to play in power armor and melee (which I hate) because of this.
---
Kids who grind into the hundreds have a better time of it because they've defeated the RNG gods, but I've got better things to do with my life.
---
Thanks! I'll look out for it.
---
That’s what I’m starting to think, time to give a chance to other games.
---
What is a reasonable price you would say for nuka cola?  Have a hard time pricing beverages.
---
Mr fuzzy tokens, always looking but never finding lol
---
I close and relaunch the launcher when the game prompts me for a password. It's like the launcher loses connection with the server or something. Then it usually behaves once have it running again.
---
Damn is that Subject K-117M? he looks good! Guess he didn’t find his first wife...
---
Stable flux, *** Legendary items with solid perks, cheap stims, fusion cores, bulk lead..
---
Ill keep it in mind and adjust the weught perks in the later game. Thanks
---
Radshield is great, though the Strangler Bloom can be a challenge to source.
---
I'm not sure i can ever face a deathclaw again without a deep wave of sorrow hitting every part of the body still capable of feeling in this harsh wasteland.
---
Ok maybe a bit too far, i miss Steve
---
No kidding!
---
I use ballistic bock alot
---
As has been said, Uranium fever.  Make sure you tag every single miner you can.  After it's over, pick up everything then run over to the train station and scrap it all.  You'll walk away with 300 + steel and around 50 black titanium.  Well that depends on how many MMs spawn, but that's typical for me if a few other people show up.
---
What kind of flux?
---
Keep mine near top of the world as it is a cross roads for not only missions but the train station seems to be a preferred fast travel spot.
---
I moved from Twin Lakes to WS and my sales have doubled. For now I suggest a camp move
---
How often did he play? Is it comparable to good with salt lvl 2?
---
Where is the Uranium Fever event?
---
Player Vending is an option if you have the caps or go to Welch or Uranium Fever as other have suggested
---
I'm looking for good legendary weapons at good prices and ALWAYS plans I don't know.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Thank you! I hope this cool feature will see the light someday.
---
lucky get though
---
Yeah that would be really helpful for players who don't use like LFG or Reddit to find the tourists.
---
Yes, as a temporary fix. But since vamos are so large, usually I have to respawn  a few times before I can set up shop. 
---
Thanks for the advice though
---
i do it is the best thing ever stuff last for days, and it frees up to the 3 luck points
---
I had a mirelurk king for like 4 months. One day I logged in, Todd Howard had came by broke my fishpuppers neck and left him on my porch. I keep going to the random event humane society, but still havent found my King. :(
---
We were on for at least 5-6 hours both days and I don't use that perk so I'm not sure.
---
I just hit level 100 and just started leveling bloody mess.  Probably would have made life easier but I am a hoarder and have banked most of my points in strength and weight reduction cards.  I'm still trying to figure out how to reduce my hoarding so I can shift some points into luck as I don't currently have it equipped and it's not even fully leveled.
---
Surprised nobody mentioned Breach and Clear yet
---
I’m just doing it for the resources
---
Alcohol may not work for your build, but each one gives different benefits; for example with the right perks whiskey becomes an effective combat boost. Nukashine is a lot of fun to use and can provide a very situational escape when you'd rather be anywhere aside from where you currently are, and you can revive players with alcohol if you're playing a quack surgeon. Hard Lemonade requires vodka, and if you plan on selling lemonade in your shop and want to include a hard version you could trust in your scavenging skills or can buy from a vendor, but I'd rather have as many ingredients made at home as possible. Some of the new beers and liquors have decent effects, as well. Plus: if you're playing a pirate character brewing means that the rum will never be completely gone
---
I'm on the outskirts past your average blast zone radius. I don't have much of an issue finding a server.
---
Black water mines, right next to white springs resort and directly next to the white springs train station.  So, you can easily walk to the station over-cumbered and scrap all your stuff at the workbench there, then drop it all in the stash box that's there too.  Look up a wiki or youtube on how to do it.  9x outta 10 someone will join you.  There are also 3 spawns of legendary mole miners so that's why most people do it.  Lots of times they're 3*.
---
Also, when you do find them in vending machines what would you pay for them?
---
Jesus Christ you just love going around in circles don’t you?
---
Dirty variants are usually common, clean is rarer and/or available in Atom Shop
---
What I would do is choose between semi or auto and go with that.
---
Given current trends, I wouldn't be surprised to see a wash basin added to the cash shop. Probably something $15-$20 for one.
---
Bet the horse likes it!
---
The Musician possum challenge is bugged.
---
I like the idea of finding holotape(or buying atom shop ones) to improve the variety of music.
---
Plans I don't have yet. Super cheap serums as backup in case I ever need them.
---
Recently I went on a .308, lead scrap, and aluminum scrap hunt. 
---
I'll always buy reasonably priced Ballistic Fiber.
---
lol chill out this is a brilliant trap.
---
Good grief, why do you bother playing at all, you know you have better things to do with your life than hang around with grinding kids.
---
Im just replying to this constant stream of petty comments you keep on posting to me.
---
What would be a reasonable price? I've only got like 7 but I'm def not gonna go farm enough to get anything good, so I should just offload them.
---
A dead t-posing falling through the ground, teleport a few feet above the ground, only to fall back under in an infinite loop
---
As has already been said, you got a VERY good roll.  Damn nice.  I have zero heavy gun perks, I'm a bloodied melee; yet I keep a vampire's gatling with 90% reduced weight and faster fire rate on me at all times.  With zero perks it does noticeable damage.  I can't imagine a bloodied explosive with all the perks in place.
---
If PC the .ini file allows you to turn it on and off. Turning off that damn music is a great QOL improvement.
---
Armor, plans, ammo, cool trick shit
---
I took over someones workshop at poseidon energy plant after they logged off it was all set up with gun turrets and all even had 2 fusion cores in the machine and a bit of lead.
---
Purveyor for legendary, WS Bunker for normal.
---
I’d say 30 - 40 caps a token seems fair, but if someone was really close to getting their costume and just needed 10-15 tokens to do it they might pay a lot more just to get it over and done with lol
---
humane society random event? Haven't heard of that one
---
protective i though, not sure though
---
great thanks, i check the ini.
---
Currently that is broken and it stacks with GWS lvl2.
---
It will be fixed eventually but if spoilage is a concern, well...
---
I have not tested if the two stack 'additively' thus reducing the spoilage rate to 0 or 'multiplicatively', thus making it 84% slower.
---
For my usage the backpack is more than enough, and I love freeing LCK points to fit some of the best perks in the game.
---
Flair checks out
---
Can't believe they haven't capitalised on this yet. It would increase the RPG aspect of the game if you could choose to be human, ghoul, super mutant. Ghouls could start with lowered charisma and strength, with a buff added, and mutants could have something similar.
---
I think everyone would love it.
---
Gonna be instant buy for me
---
It sucks you get bored! I've found that 20-50 sucks personally cause it just feels like a grind to 50 but after that I feel like I'm free to do whatever I want. With my friends we never seem to find an end to the bullshit we get into lol
---
I have some good urban armor. A 3* chest piece,  and another 3* and a 2* limb armor. All max level.
---
I don’t know if there’s a going rate for them but if I saw some in a vending machine I’d be happy paying 30-40 caps each for them, but if someone was really desperate to get their costume they might pay more
---
It'll only be this low for non-U.S. versions of the game.
---
Do you know if there's clean variant of arktos lab coat?
---
We've gotta draw the line somewhere.  First it's super mutants, then what? Next we'll have someone trying to marry as radstag or preach about man - yao guai love.
---
I've started wearing a full set of armor under my power armor and jumping out of my PA when I can.  The core drain is insane with VATS.  I usually carry a TSE double barrel shotgun and a TSE handmade.  Using them in combination on a scorchbeast will drain a core or 2 in no time.  I'm basically carrying cores for VATS now.
---
I somehow glitched a water purifier so that it is partially floating/glitched into the top of a wall.  I can't select so I can't scrap it.  I was tempted to place my camp down again but I had just spent hours on a new camp build when that happened.  Pissed me off.
---
Its's just a random event. Only said humane society because that's typically where you adopt pets.
---
yes, in fact I'm wearing one now =) It's one of rewards for completion Project Paradise event
---
k
---
I'm wearing too but it's dirty, yours is clean? Can you do a shot for me
---
Snallygasters are awful looking, but Wendigos are the creepiest looking because of the uncanny valley aspect and the odd movements.
---
Only creature to consistently scare the crap out of me, though, is the Mothman. Hard to see, jump-scare bastard.
---
I can't wait til I get my unyielding set finished!
---
[It will be like this in game](https://coub.com/view/246f9)
---
party time. bonus.
---
Awww do you need your safe space??
---
I use a AAE 50 Caliber and a TSE Gatlin love them both but the AAE 50 is better for the SBQ.
---
The highest level item I've sold (had it listed for 6k) sold when I was at 23k caps.  :(
---
Just don’t put your camp right on the edge and only go out 3-4 tiles :) I’ve had some success moving the camp around inside the circle to move my own and my pets spawn point
---
You on PC? If so try caps lock, it should be the toggle slow walk button. Not sure if console has something similar
---
Then I assume the all-female super mutant concept was either unique to capitol wasteland or is a Bethesda goof.
---
A constant stream of beer has supplanted my need for water, and in the game too. 
---
Seriously though, I picked up the party boy perk when brewing came out, and I haven't looked back.
---
*Come human human human...*
---
If you have any weight reducing perks or armor try unequipping then re-equipping them.
---
Lol, yeah, it would look like that. And t would be cool :)
---
Radio relay towers should be contactable like workshops and let you DJ. Some wacky commercials would be cool as well.
---
Interesting.  Veeeeeeery interesting.  Welp, think its time to start paying attention to those daily quests then!
---
&gt; you could become a football player and make it a career.
---
Have a backup plan. Not everyone who tries to go pro will make it. And there's always the risk of injury knocking you out permanently.
---
Don't half-ass classes because they don't fit your plan/
---
Im just nipping out for a smoke, you may as well take your eyes of my profile for 5 mins lol
---
Not in *this* wasteland!
---
Welcome to Appalachia! I would honestly save your atoms until you see something that you really want! 
---
Don't worry about buying plans early on - they'll come easy from taking workshops, doing quests etc. Also check every container you come into contact with - in addition to junk you also have a chance to find plans there as well. 
---
Hold onto ammo like shotgun shells, .45 and 5.56 as these seem to be the most used ammo in the game and even if you don't end up using it - you can sell it to other players thru player vending (same with plans you already know) 
---
If you'd like - when I get off work today I can try to hook you up with some low level gear and stuff as I'm on Xbox too &lt;3
---
I'm at work now, so sorry. But there are screens on wiki:
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Arktos\_lab\_coat](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Arktos_lab_coat)
---
Mole rat marriage you know what Fuck it pologomy mole miner and deathclaw plus others
---
If sarcastic, this is uncalled for. 
---
If not sarcastic, scorched aren’t all female. The lead Raider from Rose’s quest line was a man and he became a Scorched and you have to kill him to get his key fragment.
---
Also, Gob is male in Fallout 3 (Ghoul), as are Charon (Fallout 3), and many others in Underworld and in the tunnels trying to take over Tenpenny Tower.
---
Deathclaw island. Low level deathclaw. Kill loot and change server. Repeat until overweight with titanium and gears.
---
There natural spawn from original placement is all the way back in the trees for the cliff side Camp. I’d bet even a cat/dog would have an 8% chance of surviving up there haha :) jokes
---
Materials. I vote 1000 times for materials.
---
Holy crap, everyone sells the same damn plans in every single vending machine. At 180 I've got most of the plans i can find already.
---
But you want my caps? Have well priced materials like Steel, Gunpowder, Lead, Aluminum, Ultracite, Stable Flux, hardened mass, nuclear materials, high radiation fluids.
---
If you have a ton of that stuff you WILL be a scrap tycoon  even if your selling 1to1. The last time i came across a player with gunpowder, my buddy said grab a bunch. 700 caps for 700 gunpowder, 500 caps for 500 steel, 400 caps for 400 lead. 
---
Thats you you please customers. Not overpriced shit because you think you're a Mercedes dealer.

---
Makes fast travel easier. 
---
Allows the benefit of team cards like Inspirational, Bodyguards, Squad Maneuvers, etc. 
---
I often offer to team up with a random lower level player and share my Inspirational 3 perk card so they get +15% experience. 
---
Also, for vendor runs...
---
If I can get just one teammate, a +2 to Charisma from Magnetic Personality 2 combined with Hard Bargain 3 is a passive Charisma boost of +11.  Add in Military Fatigues (Resistant) for another +1, throw in a Mothman Egg Omelet (+2) and a Pickaxe Pilsner (+1), and pop a Grape Mentats (+5) , and that’s +20 to Charisma. With just a Charisma of 5, you could equip those 2 cards, and get to a 25 Charisma, which puts you at 25% of base price for selling to vendors and only 175% of base price for purchasing. 
---
With only a Charisma of 1 overall, you’re selling at 10% and buying at 250%. 
---
So, for example, if selling a 100 cap item to a vendor, you’d get between 10-25 (so effectively your selling at 2.5 times as much as you normally could) and if buying a 100 cap item, you’d pay between 250-175 (effectively getting a 30% discount).
---
Sometimes, even I tag the queen (with 3 full barrel of gattling gun ammo...) I do not get any loot. Noob and poor me :(
---
Xbox?
---
I feel like this could also work as an inspirational recruitment poster for the Responders. Like a Rosie the Riveter kind of setup.

Lol innit I wonder the same thing with the slow pace/types of Atomic Shop content.

ESO makes bank off pets so I can 76 being the same.

Stepped out of the elevator and a bunch of lvl 60+ ghouls came at me. Nope! Also, I answered the questions on multiple of the tadpole quizzes and got a 5/5 on most , do you need a 5/5 on all?

This comment.  I cannot upvote it enough.  I'm going to drastically change my vending machines tonight and take all this into consideration

Not 100% sure but try checking the blackpowder shop in whitesprings.

Is it OK to simply remove it? Does somebody know the filenames of the other songs?

If bethesda can add differant variants of the jukebox into the build mode, that would be great.
---
These are the variants:
---
Regular Jukebox (as it is now)
---
Frat House Jukebox
---
Nukashine hideout Jukebox (can be an unlockabe upon completing "Wasted on Nukashine"
---
Sons of Dane Jukebox (I like this one) (Also can be unlockable upon completing "One Violent Night" event.)

Any other Jukebox variant.

I agree with this. Or raise the amount of scrip to somewhere like 200 per day.

Beware the bloody flip knife.

Oof, I would of loved to check it out. Too bad abot the post being removed.

Aim at the belt and control your right index finger.

4th shot is usually in the forehead, release, adjust aim, repeat.
---
Works for me :)
---
Throw in some tips  for the unexperienced players too. I'm about to hit level 3 and was thinking of doing a stealth sniper build. What are the pitfalls along the way?
---
Less a glitch, I think, and more Bethesda's wacky physics, but I love when the final shot/hit on an enemy is super overkill. Rather than just dying it launches them into space.
---
Sucks when it's a legendary but otherwise it's fun to chase them and try to be where they land.

said this yesterday. keep going back to the m/miracles site. if mole miners are on site,do another run. 20/30 moles. anything else spawns, leave or server hop.loads of b/t in no time.

have fun
---
Fun times!!!
---
Yeah, thing is you become so op that nothing really matters anymore, the mystery and danger is gone.
---
The real difficulty is having enough 5 mm rounds! LOL
---
Thats why in F3 they kidnap people from the Capital wastes so they can douse them in FEV. 
---
Though I think I remember seeing something from fallout 2 IIRC where a super mutant said something along the lines of “Of course we can reproduce. It just takes a while to get the juices flowing.”
---
If you spam the VATs hotkey you will see the fusion core energy drain very quickly.  However, I don't know if it's a bug or not, but if you equip even 1 rank of Power User and spam VATs, it hardly drains at all when you spam the hotkey.
---
Try to look in the menu. I forget whar was that button, but I found in the list there.
---
It was the caps lock but it was changed.
---
I want vehicles. Motorcycles, cars, trucks, vertibirds. All would require upkeep and fuel production.
---
That's a good point. Having multiple options is best.
---
are you trading or selling any of them?
---
Marcus would like to have a word with you.
---
I thought they announced some form of display case? Not a full blown drop anything anywhere in your camp. 
---
I would prefer the latter of the two as I dont want a case of bears or mr fuzzy bowties. I want them strategically placed in obscure areas doing unconscionable things.  
---
That's right we're looking at you Lil' Ginger Snuggles.
---
Or when you open a door and it leads to a Twighlight Zone of open terrain or only half-loaded open terrain and gaps to fall through the world.
---
Close the door and re-open - it shows the room it leads to like normal.
---
Been happening to me for the last two days on PS4.
---
it's like my character occasionally drags his feet in the mud ans slows down. then goes back to normal.
---
(also I should note I based this off of an old chinese communist propaganda poster from the 50's "Let 100 flowers bloom" to site my source)
---
It’s Richa Shukla! Looked her up on YouTube and can confirm.
---
You are literally the Amazon of player vending, you will put us all out of business!
---
I thought my diluteds at 12c were a steal.... Lol
---
Though I dislike these trap camps. But they are a part of this game. “You decide who’s hero, and who’s villain” This is the idea of this game which describes by the director himself. If you can be a hero, why others cannot be raiders?
---
It sounds like they plan to do seasons for Survival mode eventually. Will make starting a new guy way more competitive.
---
Yeah...it gets exhausting. Here you go: https://anchor.fm/fallout76podcast
---
This happened to me last night. Took like 15 minutes, several game restarts, and even a desperate PC reboot before I got past the infinite loading screen. :(
---
I was walking back to a train station after an hour of looting to stock up on aluminum and stuff. RIP all that time and effort.
---
Try an auto railway rifle, it works with your build and does great damage. Ive been using an explosive one recently; shooting in bursts or 3-4 or else it pulls up.
---
base stats? or with mods and *s?
---
5 and 10 for regular and cherry.
---
If i get a big stash of them (like 50 or so) then ill bump it to 7 and 15.
---
If people can one stop shop it i find they will buy the whole stock in one go. Saves on travel.
---
Cherry acts like a diluted stim +water and with the perk it gets better then a regular stim. So they sell well but you may have to wait couple of days on those. Just keep adding to the pile and someone will buy it all.
---
He wants to show you his green stuff.
---
Mine just doesn’t stop walking slowly.
---
If I remember correctly Bethesda has said in the past they have a reason for not doing this. I don't remember what but I'm sure it was stupid
---
Both scout and combat armor are great options for durability and protective purposes.
---
Thanks
---
Yeah I think I'm definitely leaning towards the .50 cal
---
Im back bro
---
Hopefully better worded surveys than the few they have run on their forums. They have a tendency to shoehorn people into results that do not really express their opinion.
---
I could see them carrying on that pre-war anti communist spirit, especially with Liberator bots crawling out (Unless that happened post-scorched which I seem to remember it may have for plot reasons).
---
If you stock thousands of junks, you WILL sell. I know people that server hop and icon hover looking for JUNK numbers, not weapons or anything. My weapons are already god tier, some at least. 
---
Fluxes at 30-40 caps, i purchased 6k worth of yellowcake without even thinking about where to store it.
---
And once players realize you are a scrap dealer, they will friend request you and turn into regulars. Guaranteed.
---
Plasma gun yes, Enclave plasma gun no.
---
There are a lot of games that have a large open world with a much more stable engine.  Let’s not pretend this game doesn’t have loading issues - there are many times I go to an area (posieden energy plant is a primary culprit) and it is barely loaded.  One time I got trapped in a truck that finally popped into existence as I was moving around :( it’s a shame because I really enjoy the game, but I’ve never played a game that has so many issues, new, old, reintroduced or otherwise...  
---
Where is the polish? 
---
I’m not talking about graphics - that is a necessary sacrifice for a large open world multiplayer experience, as you mention.  I’m specifically referring to the bugs, clunky UI and qol features that games now have as a standard (long presses on certain interactions, for example).  
---
Basic stuff.  
---
They’re clinging onto this archaic engine, which I can only imagine is a convoluted mess of spaghetti code at this point...  it worked for 10 years ago but not anymore and it really does fallout 76 a huge injustice.
---
Do you mean toggle Always run?
---
yep winner winner chicken dinner you beat a lvl 7 equipped with a pipe rifle and wood armor your the best lvl 345----------------- prob teabaggged him to boot
---
Yes. Maybe you pressed it somehow.
---
Awesome to know, thanks g
---
I could do either, prefer trade, but caps if you dont have anything I like. I've been debating switching over from my heavy bos set because they look cool, but I just cant pull the trigger on it. I'll do the whole set for you for a good deal. I'm not sure the specifics on them at the moment,  but the stars are accurate and all max lvl. I'll check the specifics when I get home. Do you have a max lvl aae combat rifle by chance?
---
I think the imposter should have its own loot pool that leaves out wood and 1 stars.
---
Or, balance things so that wood armor is useful in some situations.  Right now it's supposedly great for stealth, but when I tried using it as a stealth rifle build, while it took mobs longer to find me, they made up all of that time in how quickly they could kill me.
---
I'd make wood ridiculously good against melee attacks.  Like it would be worthless to attack someone in wood with a melee weapon.
---
If I hadn't just watch this clip I'd say you were lying. The last time I saw a Behemoth was in the damn BETA. What's up with that??
---
I like the game music. Ion Zurr and Fallout are a match made in heaven. A big part of why I like Fallout so much
---
2 handed melee isn't bad.
---
Yeah that happend to me. Got killed shortly after leaving the vault.
---
I said F this shit. I only play in Adventure mode now.
---
I would recommend you to have some patience. After you reach lvl 50 you can start to respec your SPECIAL points and get new perk cards. For builds… it depends on you; bloodied commando it's one of the best, but need to be carefull about life and rad management; vanguard with AntiArmor and/ or Junkie weapons seems pretty solid, etc
---
I’m running all 3* scout and like it so far. I’m building sets of unyielding weightless combat and marine to test out
---
I mean ofc they will, they can finally kill someone with the $50+ tse gun that they bought off of ebay with their parents money. They just finished middle school and now have all summer play instead of just the weekends.
---
Your right. Damn I’m dumb👍
---
Fair point. That mechanic in this game is 100% cheese. It's a self-powered, mobile suit of armor, you should just be able to send it back to your camp or summon it with some kind of waiting period. Making it vanish and magically appear in your inventory was an odd design choice.
---
With mods that can be learnt. It would be a chore to buy them if there's any naming confusion.
---
Nice, I’ll have to try it
---
I love my abomination build, lol.
---
Level 60. When I hit 50 I had 12 Charisma, but I've dropped down to 10.
---
Perks all over the place. Lower junk and food weight, reduced food spoilage, lockpick. Mix of stealth, rifle/sniper, and 1-hand melee.
---
It's entire an Explorer build, lol. Focus on QoL and being able to explore for a long time, not focused on being able to one-shot or solo anything.
---
One a day!? Please look back at any given day. It’s typically one post every 1-3 hours, 15+ posts just like this every single day!
---
I just want my buggy shithole called my CAMP to be fixed.
---
Its suffering from DTS.
---
You can not turned in your stored ones I think. It does not let me neither. But you can find and turn in as much as you want.
---
Here is my build:
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3d337de&amp;d=sb0s01p00pd2pk2pp2pl2eh2c70ce0ic4s11a72a41an2ao0a00a32l71lt1lu2lv0l12lk2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3d337de&amp;d=sb0s01p00pd2pk2pp2pl2eh2c70ce0ic4s11a72a41an2ao0a00a32l71lt1lu2lv0l12lk2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=)
---
a few things to consider:
---
\-depending on your play style, you can choose to go with commando perks in agility tree for an automatic weapons build
---
\-i love using energy weapons and carrying 10-15 fusion cores for nuke zones, so 2 ranks of batteries included is useful 
---
\-if you don't plan to carry thousands of ammo (but you'll have to especially if you go full auto), then you don't need the bandolier perk in strength tree
---
\-fireproof is necessary for pvp to reduce the incoming explosive damage
---
\-in charisma tree, if you're not in a group, use lone wanderer and traveling agent or tenderizer (1 rank). In a group, definitely go for the strange in numbers
---
\-1 rank of adrenaline is good enough for value. during night time, swap marathoner for sandman (to get 3.5x sneak damage)
---
\-definitely put a suppressor on your weapon
---
\-class freak+ starched genes god-tier combination to get the best out of several mutations
---
\-gun fu, critical savy and one rank of better criticals are the only essential perks for a vats build. i can one shot almost any non-boss creature with even a regular combat rifle or handmade
---
Well they probably got their asses handed to them a dozen plus times before so they’re taking what they can get...lol
---
Roll out with higher levels and you can be bait...lol
---
No not sarcastic at all, it’s just the scorcheds’ voice and the way they are dressed resemble female much more than male. Many of the ghouls are completely naked yet no male feature, that’s why I thought maybe they’re all female or neutral.
---
I guess you have a female character? The male one is worse ... it clips everywhere, the worst part are the arms.
---
It happened to me too once or twice...
---
Didn't even know it was there, so you're not dumb at all.
---
i can top this I ran into a guy who built his cliff side and had traps push you over activated by floor switches he had installed on the patio overlooking his vending machines a evil fricken genius I am pretty sure he had sharks with fricken lazer beams placed underneath(best dr evil voice)
---
Oh is that the push to talk? I'm used to the other fallouts having toggle walk there so I may have changed it. Sorry about that
---

---
    Pioneer Scouts: Completing Stings and Things, Operation Tidy, and Campfire Tales will no longer award Possum Badges to players who have not yet been promoted to the Possum rank.
---
Can they be unyielding and weightless? That would be great for my build, so I can be perma invisible but in armour.
---
Breach and Clear event gives you a lot of ore of all types. 
---
Deathclaw Island spawns a lvl 21 deathclaw.
---
I agree. I feel that DXP weekends bring more people into the game.
---
Suggestion: have a celebitory double xp weeklong celebreation in leau of lauching the Nuclear Winter DLC pack!
---
Ah. Gotcha. I can see how you’d come to that conclusion. I just assume that it’s fallen off since they’re losing parts a lot (think Patches from Fallout 3). Gob was implied to be an intact male ghoul by Nova in Megaton as well.
---
Mine,would be the same thing.
---
You can turn in stored ones. Take them out of your stash, put it in a container and then take it back out. To do multiples, you have to server hop in-between.
---
i can give you some for charity sake if you're on PC and on now.
---
When the season hits it can be a pain to scramble to make things like healing salve. Thats what i want it for. Lvl 2 salt is amazing difference when hunting for items.
---
They can't be both Unyielding and Weightless, no.
---
I feel dumb. I trashed my collection in anger :(
---
Quest triggers every time I find one in the wild... never triggered when taken from stash... you could try putting them into a container then taking them out again...
---
Oh okay. Thanks so much!
---
If you have a teammate it becomes theirs.
---
NOT regular items you can find all over the place. Been seeing that a lot! 
---
Plans like metal beds and chem benches or ivory handled grip should just be dropped for other players or stuff them in cash registers or overseers caches. 
---
Regular spacesuits / helmets that people can get any day of the week... stuff like that... sell it to vendors and make more. 
---
I think most want just good deals on stuff overall... 
---
Legendary armor, plans weapons serums...
---
Try this solution u/Jackaljax321
---
Anyone whose played Bethesda games knows, 75% working = game release, 95% working = done patching.
---
And the arguments that "we don't know how hard it is to fix" doesn't hold water. People have been modding (and fixing) this engine for so many years.  Numerous bugs, their causes, and fixes are known and spelled out in other threads.
---
No blame on the devs, they likely don't have any say in what they work on. It's pretty clear however that management and up couldn't care less about putting out a fully functional product, and for the most part never have.
---
Plans and recipes. I also look at legendary weapons,and armor to see if what the vendor  has is better or worse then what I have.
---
I do browse junk too to see if there is rare hard to find junk items.
---
[](/v33)TIL from that video I've been using the shredder mod wrong for like nearly 4 years. I've just been using the bash button.
---
Snap. Did a restart character for survival too. 
---
In the 60s now but got taken out loads of times along the way. I really love the level xxx players who TSE you straight after finishing an event together before you can loot your kills...
---
Still struggling to get decent gear but when that day gets closer I’m going to start taking names. :)
---
This. I don't need an auditory alert because there's yet another Tinkerer or Chemist workstation plan nearby.
---

THIS PLZ

THIS PLZ PLZ PLZ
---
I wanted this soooo badly the other day when the group of 6-7 tard noobs were trying to tell me this was a "enclave only nuke zone" go  f---- your self Tommy........
---
Do you have all of the mods unlocked for it? Might be that sort of thing
---
Also if u farm flux u need that perk
---
Do it like Diablo 3s season system. You start a new character for a short time, and then you can take the gear you earned and move it to your main adventure character
---
Yes sir!
---
I sell Nuka Dark at 15c and can barely keep it in stock. Ballistic Bock does pretty well too
---
I find small objectives to keep me busy and go from there. For example right now I'm grinding Possum badges by doing the daily quests/Campfire Tales (the actual challenges are largely too tedious for my liking) because I want to get the Stash Box skin. In the process of doing so I sometimes make side pit stops because I feel like it, such as running to the Golf Club to clear it out and get some legendaries to cash in for scrip, or maybe completing the odd Event I stumble across for the sake of some XP and caps, etc.
---
So why not have lvl 2 salt +30lbs extra in your pack with no perk points needed. I really want a backpack ☺
---
I love this idea but sadly I think it would be too resource intensive on the servers. Server stability is already on a rocky slope.
---
The steel columns are your friend - place a column next to the stairs, then snap on the roof piece to the wall above the stairs.  
---
As for scrapping stairs - I have found that if you sink the stairs into the ground, instead of anchored on a concrete foundation, you will not be able to remove them. However, sometimes you need to place the new stairs before you delete the one you don't want. (Also, always ALWAYS finish the structure before you start decorating.)  
---
Additionally, NEVER use the wooden foundations - they have so many problems, plus players can zone in under them. (Concrete foundations will lift the player up out of the concrete.  
---
Additionally, additionally - to stack the stairs with a 1X2 platform - place a steel column on top of the platform, and then a second column on top of the first. Delete the bottom column, then snap the second story platform in between the floating column and the first floor platform.
---
Tbh I’m a casual playing level 49 with a weird build and I can’t wait to be op because combat is my least favorite thing. I’d rather combat be easy so I can explore freely and do what I want instead of creep around and stay away from baddies
---
yes im interested in the rifle. send em the stats on the armor when you get a chance. i have a bunch of caps i can spend right now
---
All three if I remember correctly.   I can sell you all three this evening if you want.  I think they are 100 in the vending machine.  I’ll do 50 to get rid of them
---
Good luck with that. I think at one time i had 33,000+ .38 ammo juat sitting in my stash before i offloaded it at vault 76. Im sure some level one was like whaaaaaat! Lol
---
If you are on PS4 that is
---
yep that would do just fine
---
[A good write up about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/)
---
I was running with someone I had met on the server and heading towards Watoga when we got jumped by a SB. This was before I got any 3 star explosive weapons, so we started chipping away at its health, we weren’t doing much very quickly. We’re getting beaten down and it’s not landing. At this point I took out my 90% reduced weight Fat Man, lined up the shot and hit the thing in mid air dealing a ton of damage. It was so cool watching the mushroom cloud form in mid air.
---
I don't think you can complete that one. I've done hundreds of queen fights and still haven't gotten it. Plenty of them were with 3 or 4 people and I run high rate of fire weapons so I've definitely gotten the last hit a few times.
---
I will play survival when they start a fresh server with new characters only. Too much duped god gear out there for me to take it seriously.
---
You lose it, you're usually joining and different server every time you relog.
---
I'd argue slightly more than 4 times for standard:diluted price ratio, because Super Duper exists.
---
I pre-ordered it. Played for like a week after BETA, but performance was so crap I quit (also Red Dead Redemption 2 took up all my free time).
---
Came back recently and have since definitely gotten my money's worth of entertainment hours for the full price.
---
It's a little more.... hollow than Fallout 4 because of the lack of human NPCs, but you get to follow a ton of human stories via notes, terminals, holotape stories, etc. The story is there it's just not flagged on your map or being thrown in your face.
---
Camp building is great. Seeing other camps is awesome. Player vending is fun.
---
Some people complain about solo, but I play solo and don't suffer too much. For big events that need a team, lots of players usually show up, so you can complete things without being on a team.
---
I put way too many points into weight-reducing perks in strength. They don't help your stash limit which is where you'll store everything anyway. And you eventually learn that this isn't a game where you can hoard things.
---
i sell my stuff for super cheap.  every once and a while someone will come by and buy pretty much everything, i'm sure they are selling it for more, but idgaf cos it's still 5 or 9 more caps then i had before.
---
900+ hrs in. Here’s what I always tell people asking this question: Be the NPC Bethesda didn’t give us! 
---
Play the game as if you’re just an NPC helping the other vault dwellers along their adventure. Do quests and events to assist some randoms. Drop them stuff they might need or want. Buy stuff from them that you don’t need to give them a few caps. Just overall be a good dude. You’ll be very surprised what this can lead to. Everyday will be a different experience filled with randomness. Spend some time building a place others will want to visit. If others like it, build them something similar. Learn to shopkeep better and earn income constantly. If you have too many caps, make it a mission to buy ALL the plans. Guaranteed it’ll take over 900hrs as I’m still nowhere close to that goal. There’s so much to do if you play the game for other people’s perspective on you, but it can be pretty short if it’s all about you just getting to the endgame. If you like it, keep playing and build on the foundation you already have.
---
Thanks for this, I'm going to check this out later when I get home.  If I have to hear about Ol Man Mose or how A Good Man is Hard To Find one more time I'm breaking open a fusion core and drinking the contents.
---
Why start over? Just making regular mat/legen farming runs and dauly events, I can level up 1-3 times every time I play. Why not just rebuild on the foundation you already have?
---
20 more levels to respec/reperk will be faster than the 50 to start over.
---
At some point, you stop even bothering with perk cards, at 197, I have 50+ banked, and have every perk card combination I could want.
---
hands down 100 pound extra carry glitch on the excavator armor
---
Looks like he skips leg day
---
the clipping is terrible with the Enclave Underarmor too, doesn't have an issue with any of the other underarmours
---
That's what I was looking for. A number of perk cards as well as a temporary bump to certain attributes I think we all use.
---
However,  the sweat put into brewing doesn't pay off at vendors. I mean purified water and bulk anything is easier than some of the brewing recipes but the vendor doesn't pay near what you can get for water or bulked junk.
---
Before vending machines those vendor bots acted as a store for things not easily craftable. I don't think the balancing of the brewing prices at vendors allows that to really take off.
---
I'm just looking to start a convo on a big addition to the game that doesn't look well thought out in terms of use.
---
Depends on what your build is but I've found BOS Combat Armor to be the best "regular" armor.
---
Same here. But for me, it would be my obsessive collection of "clean" items. Clean coffee cups and stuff like that.
---
There was a post of a person who took the time and made a Excel spreadsheet fir the tadpole and possum challenges.
---
I think the institute and WV ones have junk, they were made from separate and altered stock from the capital wasteland mutants. 
---
That and in 4 and 76, they wear underwear. Gotta be covering something.
---
I have scrapped many revolvers and haven’t got it.
---
Thanks! I like seeing your thoughts behind each perk. I'm trying to merge a few different builds to suit my play style.
---
I think sticking with semi-auto weapons but focusing on criticals will be good for me.
---
VATS/rifle builds are tough for a while but end up being kind of awesome in the end.  You might not hate it if you stick with it and tweak your stats and cards.  [This site](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) is extremely helpful when planning out your build.  Just bookmark it _after_ you create your build, otherwise you'll lose it.
---
This is really embarrassing and probably not your issue but I had the same thing happen only to realize after a while that my pipboy light had been turned on the whole time but I never noticed.
---
I like punching, smashing, or hacking at things, but sniping from a distance to soften up targets is always good :)
---
Come on mate, I feel you but they're all rushed cash grabs. Some of the PA horsemen paints look abysmal and I feel cringed when I see people wearing them. 
---
So many better looking outfits available for free in game.
---
And it affects other publishers too.. This stopped me from any pre-order activities for Borderlands 3 too and this is a completely different publisher!
---
additionally not til they are on Steam, but that is a different topic.....
---
Just saying that one publisher's actions can also stigmatize others in the business.
---
1) stop being butthurt over the auto moderator
---
2) post the damn platform you're on, before you expect people to help you.
---
What's a DCG?
---
Sleeping ghouls sliding along the ground then getting up and walking through walls after I kill them.
---
Exactly this. This is one of the reasons I can't get my friends into this game. That and the lack of respeccing and unfriendly building mechanics.
---
What does that mean, Charlie? (sorry for the basic questions...I've never done any silos)
---
Yeah, same here for me. It used to remember the password but for last week or so I need to type it every time I open the launcher.
---
Nice I hope to come accross more traps like this. The creativity and shear evilness makes it worth the risk. 
---
Well no risk to me I learned to shop in PA a long time ago but these camps are fun nonetheless.
---
Get gunsmith early. It sucks having to invest in a perk/stat that doesn't increase dmg, but the savings in mat costs and repairs at 20-40 will repay itself many times over. It also lets you apply advanced mods to your rifles.
---
Ahh.. good idea on the emotes...
---
Off topic.. got a Bloodied handmade in the store. I personally got it from the  SheepSquatch last night..
---
All three will give you some amount of black titanium. It depends on price. The least expensive gives you a map where you can find 5 (I think) of different types of ore (again, can't remember, maybe scrap but I don't think so). Next tier up gives you ten, etc. My numbers may be off (I did it 25 levels ago).
---
But if you're at least close to level 25, Welch is a pretty good place for Mole Miners. You can pick some of them off from above at the Train Station pretty safely. Unless someone higher has been around, they should be level 14 for you. I've also gone their multiple times and they were all dead. I think people like to go down there for XP, some plans (there are like 3 spawns of plans in town), and use the vendor at the station. They often leave all the moleminer gear on them because they don't need the black titanium.
---
Crafting junk gives us a plan to make that thing sounds awesome! I could have board games out on my coffee table, a Teddy Fear over by the bar, a giddy up buttercup in the yard, munching hay ... sounds great
---
they also had a reason for no push to talk button but that went away to
---
Bethesda barely have time to do bugfixing, how would you expect them to have time to protect copyright material in every single radio station?
---
I always have Good With Salt 2 but will equip 3 if I have Ant Meat. Butcher’s Bounty helps massively to obtain more ant meat. Generally I have 50 Nuclear Material at all times. I Keep 6 corn stalks at my camp and use Green Thumb when harvesting. When I need to restock I just server hop the power substation in Watoga for ant meat.
---
For Nuka Dark I just wait until I have about 40 Nuka Colas, then I go to Hillfolk Hotdogs to gather Snaptail Reed and water. This is a good one because you can kind of passively collect Nukas and they never spoil.
---
I forget all the Ballistic Bock ingredients but it’s also fairly easy to obtain all its ingredients.
---
For scout, I haven’t received either yet of those but I have for CA and Marine just not both on same piece. 
---
Seems many of the new 3* armor also has perks like breathing under water or reduced weapon, ammo or junk perks attached to each piece.
---
I think they said they would get to it before Wild Appalachia ends
---
honestly I've always thought it would be cool to be a robobrain

#NOT IN MY WEST VIRGINIA
---
Sorry, was asking if you had that rifle. Really the last piece I am looking weapon wise. Ok I'll check when I get home and let you know the stats, but I do remember thinking the chest piece was really good. And the other 2 were pretty good as well.
---
yeah i hear alot of people go shopping with 2 pieces of falling dmg armor equipped for just such occasion
---
Not really. They can't be seen from very far away.
---
I am looking for fasnacht plans on PC and no one seems to have any. I need the balloons, confetti and giant wall ribbons.
---
To answer your question more generally, people look for rare plans, mutations and good weapons/armor. Low level legendaries are also great, so save those. People use them for their alts.
---
My ideal survey for something like this:
---
*  there are X options
---
*  You can 'spend' points between the options until they total 100
---
This way if QOL item 7 is really important you spend 50 of your points on it to boost its ranking, this also indicates that the other things aren't as important to you.  
---
Otherwise everyone says everything is a MUST FIX NOW issue.
---
Yep.  Better profit margin than the civil war hat (now at least), but requires more materials that are slightly more difficult to gather.
---
Whenever I do a quick craft-n-dump, I usually go to whitesprings and then go to a shop next door so my sold inventory isn't cluttering up a commonly used vendor's inventory.
---
Especially if the closest vendor has starred inventory.
---
I occasionally run into a glitch in the ski lodge where the scorched are walking on the ceiling. Once they die they teleport to the floor in T pose.
---
I would drop Pack Rat and instead apply those points to E and perk out Ironclad at 3 points.
---
How so?
---
You can only have 1 on your character at a time, they don’t stack if you’ve started that quest line. 
---
If it doesn’t trigger the quest, place the tech data in a desk or world location then pick it back up. This has worked for me a few times.
---
That sucks. I absolutely love the concept of taming, but hell if they're gonna die protecting my camp just make them passive and immortal. I was devastated when my Mirelurk King passed away. We need taming to be fixed, and a Beast Master DLC could be a fun way to fix it.
---
Yup! Works for me!
---
There are SOME good and great fanfictions out there.  😋 
---
Fanfiction is where I got my love of writing and telling stories. 😁😋
---
12 hours would be good.. 8 or 10 would be better...
---
Scrapping ammo would definitely be nice. I always end up with a bunch of .38, fusion cells and 10mm that I just end up putting in a suitcase at the Flatwoods train station. I really wish they'd raise the limit of the stash box or let you build containers for specific things.
---
sadly I don't think nightkin exist for another like 50+ years but hey who knows wouldn't be first time we discovered something wasn't the first (just the fact they suspected it was)
---
&gt; made it so you had to make a new character and get all your gear within survival instead of people being able to farm for stuff in adventure
---
That would level the playing field for a week at most. The hardcore players would quickly farm their way back up to almost god tier weapons and you're right back where you started.
---
Maybe not a dicking, a phallusing?  Lol!
---
He’s talking about the weekly challenge, not the permanent challenge. The permanent one is broken though, I also can’t get it and I know for a fact I’ve gotten the final blow lots of times. :(
---
Are you sure?
---
I agree that loot is better in groups. It was probably designed that way.
---
You have to get the final blow. Also, the permanent version is broken and can’t be completed for a lot of people, not sure if the weekly one would be too.
---
Those prices are very good prices, and ALOT cheaper than if bought from a vendor.   
---
My plans are pretty cheap. Have some ammo for free and most for 1-2 caps. Just because we can't set a flat rate for ammo like armor and weapons. I have some items that prices are what I would like to sell em for, but I have been in camp and said they're negotiable when i've overheard it was too high. No one has ever taken me up on it. 
---
/shrug People will complain regardless.
---
On a related topic, any legendary gear you get but don't want, is it better to sell it in your vending machine or trade it to one of the Exchange machines?
---
After looking at builds I'm seeing that my current build isn't all that bad. I'm going to try to respec for now. Thanks for the advice.
---
oh no sorry i dont have that gun
---
I started my survival character at level 1 in survival, and it's super fun. And weirdly, I managed to kill way more high level players than they managed to kill me. VATS pistols and crits to the head are so fast, even high level players have a hard time dealing. If they could see me, they could kill me, but getting 5 headshots off in a few seconds takes down just about any player build in the game.
---
Those kids are gonna be .... Pretty cute?
---
A cockening!
---
Deathclaw gauntlet
---
Just grind out the respec. It is faster and less irritating by many orders of magnitude. Seriously, take it from someone who has done both multiple times.
---
&gt;Did you know Deathclaws mate for life? This is possible because they understand and feel the concept of love, unlike vault dwellers.
---
That is a good line
---
I ignore 99% of the team invites i get. Unless its from someone on my friends list (which isny that masny people) or someone whos a low level player.
---
Helping a low level player is how ive undergone the transistion from solo to teaming up.
---
True, but there are a lot more cringy and/or bad fanfictions out there as well.
---
&gt;I moved from Twin Lakes to WS and my sales have doubled. For now I suggest a camp move
---
Yup. The key to sales in the game is just like real life: location, location, location. For best results you need to set up shop near some place that people will go anyways, like WS, near the purveyor, or near one of the popular daily/event locations.
---
Nice :D
---
So that's why the Enclave are a dying breed..
---
Cuz, da'y don't
---
Got better drops farming for scrip habit than I have from the purveyor... 
---
Jeez... just dawned on me...
---
Hi. I'm a scrip junkie. It has been 3 days since my last fix. I farm white springs to feed my habit and at the end I feel hollow and empty inside. I know I should just keep the loot but I can't help thinking thay my next 3 star roll will be the one... and I can give it up...
---
Truth
---
I just fast tracked and blocked. No biggie. Just was annoying me for that moment. PVP really isn’t a big deal. 
---
One time I also had a really low level play start shooting at me right at my camp. Just took a moment before I realized what was up and blasted him away. Problem solved.
---
Yes, Bethesda pls...ghoulification when? pls...
---
Leaded polymer
---
I have definitely left the area because of someone’s voice on area chat. Maybe it’s not a good idea to spread that server wide. It’s why I don’t use voice chat, emots are good enough
---
one time I went there an assaultron was spawned..
---
I got melted multiple times...
---
No it must be giantess milk (GoT)
---
I gotta look into this. I didn't know a shredding minigun without ammo could still spin. I wonder how it compares to the ripper and Mr. Handy buzz blade.
---
Could be a lot worse. Could be a gourmand chef inviting you over for "dinner".
---
I don’t use any weight reduction perks. I’m also not a hoarder.
---
your statement, while correct, would be totally irrelevant in this lore/timeline breaking installment of the franchise.
---
If we got to choose races, Gen3 Synth (or maybe Gen2/2.5) would absolutely be one of them.
---
I like the way you think!!! Immersive, challenging and fun!!
---
NP, you'll be fine. I had the exact same late game doubts as you when I was close to 50, and was lvl 70 before I finally had every base perk/stat I wanted. My build changed quite a bit again from 70-100 as I filled out gear, and started weighing QOL and DPS.
---
Ultimately, recommendations are good, but you'll need to make the final decisions on your playstyle.
---
mute your tv/monitor until the world starts loading.
---
first thing I do in any FO game is mute the music. i find it more immersive without it.
---
once I’ve played a ton I do turn music on just to check it out but i eventually get tired of the combat music kicking in before I’m aware of enemy presence, then I turn it off again lol
---
I sell mutations at my store and from sales history and speaking to other 76-citizens, I don't think there are any "regular humans" left!!!
---
The bull barrel doesn’t exist in the vanilla game, you need to use mods on pc if you want it. Not sure if it’ll be added later.
---
I agree though, the other barrels look like bitches compared to the bull. Really wish they hadn’t skimped there.
---
Excellent reading!
---
I also thought about that, but there’s a problem, at least for the questing part, higher lvl enemies will spawn because of me, right?
---
But this is very solid, thanks!
---
weird stuff low lvl legs useful for alts fun things like 10mm tse boom boom and knives really good knives seem hard to come by everyone seems to hold on to them like grim death
---
If you know how to scrap cars please tell me, I would love to know any tricks. It feels so frustrating to be standing in the middle of a scrap field and your crafting table says "Need steel"
---
They give the basics for free. They can’t make everything for free or they won’t be able to afford to keep the game going or afford to update/monitor glitchers.
---
Welcome back. How was your smoke?
---
^this
---
*I got a treat for you....*
---
I realized when I was around level 40 on my first play through that my build was all over the place..created a new character specifically a rifle build and it took about 5 weeks to catch up with the other character..now that character is actually higher on level..86..and my first character is 78..the more u level the more u can fix up your perk card selections..it's good having multiple characters so u can earn more caps..which comes in handy while trading..so yeah..I would advise u create another character this time u will not make any bad perk card choices..but..I'd pick one specific build instead of two or more
---
I run BM3 all the time.. 
---
Ive got a BC2 that is a swap card for me.. it isnt always in like BM
---
Well, there's another source of lead to mark...
---
Unfortunately, I agree with you.  O.o  I've read some bad ones...
---
There are... they just look SOOO BUFF that you can't tell.!
---
You know what needs to happen now, new random encounter with a friendly deathclaw named Steve  
---
u/Ladydevann
---
the only thing Ive spent any atoms on so far was an emote...
---
Make sure to include it in the game!
---
I think your experience mirrors most of everyone on here
---
Mole miners. Good source of plastic and rubber too for mass crafting/selling of *cough*, *cough*, **not this time Bethesda!!**
---
LGBTQ+SM?
---
Which emote in the atom store is so vital to your online interactions that it should be free? Emotes are cheap, you can get enough free atoms to buy one in a few days.
---
it costs money to play music in the game
---
Try lowering your graphics to minimum before you do that again
---
aaaaaand you are blocked
---
Hey, hands off [my man](https://i.imgur.com/zEqlKXB.jpg)!
---
Haha. Super mutants need loving too. They’ll just turn you into one when they’re through with you. No biggy.
---
After several hours of server hopping and visiting camps, I finally have it by getting plants in a nuke zone.  No one nukes anymore and I'm all tapped out.  Thanks mate for the reply.  Cheers!
---
It’s kinda neat having a physical copy. I like having it on my shelf
---
I’m playing today for a little while, psn Linzsays

Just suggesting using the work of others, who have already made the lists. It's easier to check-tasks-off than to take extensive notes. See the following:

I’m thinking that the female-only SMs were a Capitol Wasteland-only phenomenon. If you recall, the Super Mutants travelled with these unspeakable horrors that clearly used to be human. I’m wondering if these failed Super Mutants are the Capital Wasteland FEV’s affect on males. I think the creatures were called Chimera or something like that. They had gross, long tongues and were a puddle of human goo, basically. They were replaced my Mutant Hounds in Fallout 4 and 76.
---
I love the Super Mutants because they carry caps and put cha-ching in my pocket. Weary of the Rule 34 peeps reading this!!!
---
It is still possible to get your daily events bugged. Completely locking you out of rewards tied to those. Like shielded lining among a few things.
---
Same comment on every god damn survival post,
---
Get over it already.
---
[deleted]
---
I spent about 13-15 levels fixing my bastard build. It's not that bad
---
Would love this, wouldn't be hard to balance alot of things and give +dmg to group weapons a usage.
---
Just did it. No problems.
---
this one knows
---
umm...OP, it seems YOU are the @#$@#$@$ griefer in this situation
---
so you couldnt access something in another players CAMP so you figured you'd just destroy his CAMP by kiting enemies? 
---
full stop---&gt;you.are.an.asshole.
---
Sorry, onn Xbox but thanks anyway
---
No worries 😊
---
Farm deathclaws, they drop it.
---
I'd prefer to see a compromise that lets the player horde up caps with a larger limit than 25K in a bank, though the pocket limit should stay the same or be reduced to encourage use of banking. Just rattling off a concept.
---
yep agreed 100 percent 
---
give those ffffers some tinfoil hats plz
---
I will place flowers at my deathclaw bush for Steve, we are all at loss this day
---
I tried running Spotify in the background (xbox) but after being smashed in the back of the head by a Super Mut a few times, I stopped.  I just could not hear the big noisy guys coming.
---
As much as I would like to be able to clean my mr fuzzy suit, it would make rare clean versions of current outfits instantly worthless. I hope they never do this
---
Wait, so you can befriend super mutants in 76??
---
is that todds voice as the principle at watoga high?
---
whats this?
---
No, wearing PA unequips the backpack.
---
3\* Scout Armor Right Arm w/ +1 STR and 90% Weapon Weight Reduction and any primary legendary effect so long as it isn't Junkies or Nocturnal but preferably Chameleon or Cloaking.
---
Been weeks, still haven't found it.
---
Dude. Amazing! You need to link to whatever you use for an official point of release... Deviantart, Facebook, whatever. Somebody should hire you based off this alone!
---
It’s hit or miss for me but two things that always sell out immediately for me are plans and treasure maps.
---
Personally I would advise fixing what you have and making a new character in a different style.  Don’t just make a second sniper, go shotguns or melee or what have you.
---
This is my current sniper build, which I’m changing to now Bc of the high capacity backpack and not needing 3 str anymore.  I’ve easily spent 20 levels on stat moving over time, just hit 146 last night.
---

---
At your level you can go anywhere, and your drops would be near your level.  You also should have starched genes and be working on ideal mutation setup.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’ve got 5 characters (1 of each weapon base type), and enjoyed leveling.  However my first character was a huge mess of wasted perks and the second a slight mess of wasted perks.  It wasn’t til 3-5 that I figured out good perks, and honestly I’m still learning them.  The 5 weapon styles all play a bit different (rifle melee shotgun pistol heavy) so try something new then come back to your old character.
---
I have been posting about this since launch. Since I wanted to make a charisma and int build. It's just not possible for some to use some of the content sadly. It's really stupid and together with special changes bugging with charisma cards will never be changed I think. Kind of the reason I gave up.
---
Same, I like the treasure maps because I almost always get a plan out of them which I can sell
---
You see that Red Blur? That's me. That too. There I am again. My name is Barry Allen. I am the fastest ghoul alive.
---
Hey,  a kill is a kill.
---
You on PS4?  I have a black powder pistol with anti-armor.  Level 45 or 50?  Cant remember and I'm at work.  Im a rifle guy myself.
---
Nice. I have a bloodied pipe, and that works pretty well. The plentiful ammo is a bonus. A handmade is tempting, but at the bloodied scale I'm not sure the damage boost would be worth the constant ammo scrounge.
---
As a purveyor of several dozen 3\* legendary items with many more in reserve what do you consider 'solid perks'?
---
Yeah for this reason I do not have a camp on my main character because people were spawning - causing enemies to spawn - said enemies killed my pets. It happened a couple times and I completely removed the shop and now my pet is my camp on my main and I've moved to selling things on my other characters who don't have pets.
---
it's still really frustrating when they just watch the super mutants destroy my camp - every time I visit someone and enemies pop up i do my best to kill them - thought it was common courtesy but i guess not in the wasteland
---
That fixed it, I didn't realize the bethesda launcher had that
---
Basher perks do increase the damage, they did in fallout 4 and from my own personal use I feel like I notice the difference if I don’t have basher on in 76.
---
To go along with that, the +40% bash damage legendary effect works too. Noticeable difference in my opinion. I believe this stacks with Basher rank 2 also. 
---
I have an anti armor +40% bash damage minigun shredder. Compared to a non-legendary shredder with the same barrel, I definitely noticed a difference.
---
I **believe** anti armor works with it since it’s applied to the whole weapon. I’ll have to watch your video to see if vampires works. That should be easy to test. In theory Furious would be a good prefix too if it works.  I could be wrong though. 
---
Overall though I’d love to get concrete info on this. Not sure if the damage values are available in the game files but I’ve never seen hard numbers for the shredder before.
---
I'm not your friend, pal!
---
(No,  I never got an error like that)
---
2 spots south of deathclaw island along the river.  If you travel south from it and stay on the shore you will see them both.
---
Gotta get them throwing knives. Lmao
---
PS4, right on d-pad uses stimpak. 
---
Maybe down. Trying to remember if down does anything. But changing fire modes on (combat) rifles would be a plus.
---
"lose your farm"
---
great reason for not helping others!  like you would ever even see any difference, the game has so many players and servers and different systems gated off from each other
---
greed is a helluva thing
---
Maybe the non reproductive gene is dominant in sm, so they eventually lost the ability

You can turn them in as many times as you like - I've bought it from players and I Just have them give me one at a time and turn it in!

Campfire stories event drops recipe
---
Awesome! there is something about looking at a battle ground and seeing multiple Scorched Beasts lying on the ground that makes you say HELL YA!!!! It doen't get less funn at higher levels either.. except you say.. which one of these didn't I get the goods off of yet...???? and have to run around checking the 10-15 dead scorched beast bodies...
---
Also luck of the draw can proc with the shredder. I’ve had it happen.
---
Durability goes down super super fast though in general but it can help when it procs
---
The girl with the power...
---
My CAMP! 
---
Or do some tadpole / pioneer scout quests.
---
There's an event that's triggered when you go to Camp Adams at night. Recipe drops randomly from there. You can do the event solo.  I have the recipe for sale if you're on Xbox.
---
My friend has a bar camp and he sells out of alchohol all the time - he makes all the different types and sells it all day - especially the Ballistic Bok and High Voltage Hefe - I usually buy the drinks from him whenever there's dailies/weeklies to drink
---
i did a white spring on my sneaky stealth melee last night worked as always didnt get tagged once and they ran right by me

Nothing will ever top Sims fanfics tho

I would like a fix to the "place an item on a surface, and it glitches to the roof" bug.

---
I'm bloodied, and only recently (lvl 170) I started trying to leave PA behind. I found a full set of unyeilding weapon weight reduction armor for $37k caps. I have no regrets.
---
Want to try to balance things out, as bloodied I have very low health at any time. I have a mixture of extra effects on my armor sure as ap refresh, that helps a ton with dodgy which costs ap, serendipity is another big one. I also use evasive as I'm melee, my survival percentage has gone up greatly as I figure out more and more. 
---
I also changed my play style to help, instead of constantly running and swinging like I did in PA, now I kill a couple and find cover to refresh and stimpak. My whole style of play is changing and I'm becoming more aware of my surroundings and noticing things I never noticed before. 
---
I can carry a metric ass ton of weapons, which is great for makig steel runs.
---
From someone with 600+ hours of experience running a heavy weapons power armor build, who melts queen in 3 minutes or less and almost never dies, here's my advice:
---
**Strength:**
---
You don't need lock and load or Full Charge - fusion cores are plentiful and reload speed is bearable with just speed demon. Recommend getting Travelling Pharmacy
---
**Perception:**
---
There's no reason to have 4 points in perception. You can swap out Glow Sight when you need to pick locks (very rare) or put in Green Thumb. Not having glow sight for an enemy or two when you're farming flux won't be a big deal. Recommend dropping to 3 points of Perception.
---
**Endurance:**
---
Rejuvenated is an OK perk, but there are better situational choices, like 2 pt ghoulish will mean you never need to use a stimpack while in a rad zone - just diluted rad away occasionally, and revenant is a huge dps boost for queen if you can pull it off. Consider picking up Radicool if you want to run a bloodied PA build (trust me, you do, it's like 3-4x the damage of a non bloodied build and you won't die as long as you know what you're doing). I'd boost End to 3 for Radicool if you're going to use it, to leave room for other stuff like 2pt ghoulish or revenant for queen fight.
---
**Charisma:**
---
Lone Wanderer is a good perk. I'd also consider Travel agent (it's a real pain to swap it in all the time and it saves you tons of caps over time) and 1 pt each of Suppressor and Tenderizer, especially for SBQ fight.
---
**Intelligence:**
---
You can drop Gunsmith (decent for leveling, definitley not needed once you're using heavy weapons) - you'll have far more improved repair kits from doing SBQ at end game than you can ever use. You can also drop Power User (again, not needed, cores are plentiful - take all 3 of the power plants and get 12 free cores every 15-20 minutes, stock up and you're good to go). If you can't mule your cores, I'd say take 3/3 batteries included. If you decide to go with a bloodied build, you'll also want Nerd Rage.
---
**Agility:**
---
Adrenaline is great. Dodgy is great situationally (can reduce incoming damage to almost zero between Dodgy (30%), Lone Wanderer (20%), Emergency Protocols (50%) and Power Armor), Action Boy is also nice for faster regen - more sprinting. Marathoner is also great but it doesn't work in PA sadly. You'll probably want Thru-Hiker. It makes managing your inventory so much easier.
---
**Luck:**
---
All good choices here.

---
There is no balance and there is free auto aim. PvP is crazy broken and they showed no sign of even a will to improve it at all.
---
I did the same thing and was equally naive. I thought - we we're all in the vault together, do we really have to kill one another on sight? So, at about level three or so I just stopped in the forest near Vault 76 to play the banjo. I mean, no one would kill a third level while they're playing the banjo, right? Of course, I got killed. And killed again and again. Another time I was stupid enough to ask for help after someone killed me, thinking - well, that's over, now we can chat. Nope, stimmed me and killed me again. Later, at about level 10 or so, I'm at the Charleston airport, and someone sends me a friend request. I accept thinking, - wow, how nice, someone who want to help me. Of course, friend request gets cancelled right after I accept, and the next thing I know I'm getting TSE'ed. 
---
Eventually I realized that I was just going to get killed a lot, and prepared for it, always being very calculating about how much aid I needed to have on me, moving my camp constantly so I could stash junk. 
---
However, with all of that, I loved it. I would highly recommend going through the main quest in survival, not for PVP, but for the extra tension and sense of adventure.
---
Fallout 76 is not your personal erotica.
---
If you can live with repairing it all the time, it’s worth it. It does absolutely insane DPS. 
---
I ripped apart a normal scorchbeast in 3 seconds. Super mutants go down almost instantly. It’s insane.
---
Not worth using in a SBQ fight though since she’s just too tanky. It will do noticeable damage but it’ll break too quickly into the fight.
---
Though one time mine broke mid fight but somehow I could still use it as long as I didn’t switch weapons . Kept shredding away and did a lot of damage to her. But that was definitely a glitch and I haven’t been able to recreate it.
---
Well.. for the reviews of said beverage.. It tastes like some sort of berry and it does not glow. I guess we could do better.

I ain’t your buddy, guy! I’ve been kicked like once an hour lol. Just happened during Uranium Fever :’)

Well that's shitty. Maybe Bethesda's legendary customer service and support staff can assist you...
---
 BoS Heavy Combat is the best armour in the game.
---
The miner maps in Ash Heap. You can get 10-20 each time and they're relatively cheap
---
Is it wrong i want game more rich and immersive?
---
I have fought it 4 times now and only been able to loot once. Do you have to do so much damage to it?
---
Bolstering and unyielding are good for melee. I'd try out some combat armor with +1 agility or endurance if you mainly use melee. Vanguard is good if you prefer high hp. You can buy the Brotherhood of Steel mods for Combat Armor to boost the damage and energy resistance for around 100 caps each now in Grafton.
---
It's a note stuck to the door of a church (...how original) with a knife, forget exactly where.  I think it actually points towards that mall that's now infested with ferals.  But yeah, it makes some sense at the Capitol Wasteland has some Appalachian refugees, they are right next to each other.
---
im sorry that happened! 
---
i've seen players run right to the vending, ignoring the enemies they made spawn in, even when the enemies run up and attack the players as they are looking at the vendor... and they dont do anything! they just keep looking at the vendor wares
---
ive heard of "shop till you drop" but this is ridiculous!
---
the stuff to make stable flux and anything legendary under 80 caps to put in the exchange box, ppl selling good legendarys are way way over priced, just because it has 3\* does not mean it's automatically worth 10k or 20k
---
Find out what he moves them for. Having a bar vending machine sounds interesting.
---
survival would be more fun if only people within 10-15 levels of you were allowed in your map until a certain point. maybe lvl 50 or 60 then its open season.
---
So this is our “Inside the Vault” for this week....?
---
It's not the damage of the sonic attack it's the "crap.. I lost my steady stream" of ultracite 5mm that I was nailing them with.. It's the blinding that I dis-like.. but no I don't want it to disappear..
---
In the early days..(like this game was out for 10 years...) peeps were complaining about how they could never target them. they kept that scream up and never landed. B changed that and life got a lot more fun.
---
I think the highest price thing is like 30 caps - except Nukashine he sells for like 50 caps
---
Relaxing bro thanks.
---
How about a robot DJ after all everything was ran by robots with themed playlists summer/fall/winter ect
---
Yep.  Holding off real news for E3.
---
I'll make sure I check that, I have done that before lol
---
Yeah I feel you there. Wish people were a little more considerate - like I understand like low level characters running from scorchbeasts that sometimes spawn but like normal players can handle some molerats/scorched/mutants you know lol
---
Yeah. Given Bethesda's E3 presentation is literally 9 days away, they're likely not going to talk about any new content until next week at the earliest.
---
i was not ready for this star trek quote, this hit me in the feels
---
They're not missing, you're just playing a different game.
---
Hey no prob, bro.
---
... nevermind.
---
Yeah, specifically Destiny 2, Battlefront 2, and FO76 left a very bitter taste in my mouth. But it's also happened with lots of other releases in the past few years from lots of different publishers
---
Thankyou for your understanding.
---
Speaking of advertising Camps, a sticker feature would be great, or maybe flyers you can post up around the map? Something that despawns after a good while and let's players know where to get the best deal!
---
The lack of Hank Williams on your soundtrack is disturbing
---
I may still be salty about the Fasnacht drop rates, but I'm glad they're using that as a template for future events. I loved that event.
---
I was only teasing :(
---
Yes, #1 is to make sure you keep track of where the fissure is so that you don't become goo and loose your junk bag. If you drop into a fissure, you WILL not get your bag back.
---
lvl 203 Farplace I've lost 4 bags to date..
---
Absolutely, bro.
---
 I'm level 96 and still have one more move to make. I need another Luck and it will come from Intelligence. I just need 5 slots for my Explosive weapons and one more Bloody Mess is useful.
---
 Think about Mutations. Some are great for your build and some will be a pain. ;)
---
How much for the recipe?
---
I’ll test the column thing when I get back in game.
---
&gt;Also, I just about died laughing about the guy that accidentally cannibalized instead of revived.
---
I must have missed that post, but that's hilarious.
---
Shit, I meant the other right. Some people call it left. Down is emotes.
---
There's only one version of the Arktos lab coat. It's kinda clean compared to the regular ĺab coat. The only clean lab coat is the Vault-tec one from the atomic shop.
---
No, Todd hates PA and decreed that it must have no advantage over legendary armor
---
I just assume when they don't patch something they just aren't capable of doing it for whatever reason.
---
Being unable to hit a target in VATS I just get stunned everytime and the random mobs falling out of the sky dead
---
The herd mentality when anyone claims they were wrongfully banned is pathological. 
---
Now I know why the players of this game are also the NPC's.
---
I love unyielding. Great for increasing all your stats, except endurance. Just get 80% irradiated and you're good to go. Deep pocketed and a few perks can get you 450.
---
So i give you free advice: find a gf and tease her, and end of story cos it's discussion not   about game.
---
About time
---
I made a FO76 Spotify playlist that I play in the background on Xbox. Seems easier than having videos playing in the background.
---
&gt; 1 stars pretty cheap if you vendor hop enough
---
Got a Bloodied handmade for I think 3k-5k caps. I can't remember. Handmade's are not my style. I'm heavy gun.
---
PC IGN Farplace
---
My wife would be upset...
---
Lol yup Marcus says that. Devs confirmed he just said it to fuck with The Chosen One because Super Mutant sterility is the argument the Vault Dweller could have used to convince The Master to destroy Unity.
---
Im just going to prep a pizza and put it in the oven, you may as well take your eyes of my profile for 10 mins lol
---
I feel like some of these bugs are new.  I just moved my camp and I had a stash box tucked underneath my stairs in my old camp but now it just teleports to above the stairs when I try to place it down in my new camp.  
---
As for not being able to place a roof over the stairs, I just reverse the direction of the stairs temporarily to place the roof and then switch it back.  Hope that helps!

I like crafting a ton of ultracite ammo for weapons I intend on priming before I prime the weapon itself. That way I can use up the regular ammo while stockpiling the ultracite ammo.
---
Some weapons it makes good sense to prime when considering crafting ammo, take the LMG for example. The LMG crafts 86 rounds for ultracite ammo and I believe less than 40 for regular ammo.
---
My default for things I could vendor is 20-25% of the base price, usually rounded down to the nearest ‘9’ if it’s above 20 caps. 
---
My stim prices are 3c for diluted, 7 caps for standard and 15 for supers.
---
My reasoning is that I almost always hit my 1400 vendor sales cap daily, without selling the bots chems, so if someone wants to buy my stuff to make a small profit margin at the robot vendors, that’s more caps in my pocket. 
---
And I’ve been told ‘nah, I can get them for cheaper’... and this was before vending machines. 
---
I’m like, seriously?  I’m selling them for less than I could sell them to a vendor bot, but you think I’m overcharging?
---
For your situation, he probably once saw a vendor selling them like I do and thought that’s the ‘basic fair price’.
---
IMHO, a true fair price for most items is between 25-50% of the base price. Anything below that is a really good deal, and anything above that is more of a ‘convenience store’ situation. 
---
‘Frak, I need more ammo to fight this SBQ, but I don’t have time to go craft. Huh, this guy is selling ammo... *sigh* I guess its worth it right now’. 
---
Anyone selling items (other than legendaries or super rare) for the ‘base price’?  Yeah, not happening. I don’t need Bulk Lead that bad, friend.
---
Dont know the labyrinth. Uncultured smh. /s
---
Hey thanks
---
I also do this.
---
I have seen one male player wearing the outfit with no clipping, so maybe it depends on your weight etc. 
---
My favourite haircut has clipping issues with my forehead, but I've seen others without that.
---
Oh, I can’t move the stairs at all. Can’t get rid of it, says if I do that part of the structure would be inaccessible.
---
&gt;I forget all the Ballistic Bock ingredients but it’s also fairly easy to obtain all its ingredients.
---
IIRC, it's grain, a couple units of gunpowder and some nuclear material. Much easier to farm than ant meat.
---
Haven’t looked at your profile since yesterday, but hope you enjoy your pizza, bro.
---
I think this best explains it, but also that FEV on the west coast is different from it on the east coast.
---
Er, the... reference I wanted to make was to fallout 2...
---
True I did see that just now, what a waste
---
&gt;prob teabaggged him to boot
---
I mean wouldn't you?
---
First time is always special hehe
---
Load of shite these developers are 😂
---
I'd love a pair of sturdy combat reduced fall damage legs, so I can dispose of goat legs.
---
i think you’re right, i knew it was grain and lead, but nuclear material is ringing a bell now
---
Whatever your taming has to be a random spawn with no other mods and high enough charisma so far no luck with muntant hounds or wolves and bears here.  Plus you need the perk cards maxed out
---
How do you know he's cute under that ritual mask??
---
New players, or mules coming in?
---
I may do more, this was sort of a last minute (I had too much coffee) inspiration when I was browsing stuff and saw the old communist chinese propaganda posters and one struck me as being perfect for making a poster of using my hammer wielding friend as a model. I'm posting a bestiary art journal thing every friday at various places, and I got a 3 times a week gag comic strip about a Deathclaw that thinks its' tiny, so this was sort of a one off. If I get inspired to do another I'll think about doing something Vault-Teky.
---
If one of those DEVS is reading this, please reconsider how enemies spawn into our CAMPS when players fast travel to visit our vending machines
---
As you stated you were impressed how popular player vending is, please dont punish us for simply taking part in the new content by having our CAMPS destroyed repeatedly every time someone simply fast travels to our CAMPS
---
U can scrap crash in f76 but it doesnt give u steel
---
Maybe a difference in the mutation?

Mostly Deviant art  [https://www.deviantart.com/drunkfu](https://www.deviantart.com/drunkfu)  (but I repost it on the fo76filthycasuals subreddit here, the falloutillustrations subredit, my twitter, tumblr, and sometimes imgur )
---
This thread is very inappropriate.
---
Yes, same for me as well.  But, I was able to select the stairs and rotate them so they face the other direction.  It seems you can't place the roof over one side of the stairs only.
---
I could def go for a 2x weekend. I need to start a new character after i messed up my build on my most recent one i leveled up.
---
***Wtb perk card resets though***
---
But please don't give them black eyes like FO4 did, I enjoy the redesign but the black eyes don't make any sense they're ghouls not demons!
---
That's fine, if they feel like working that hard then let them. They've earned it at that point. 
---
But letting people take regular characters between the two modes was a huge mistake in my opinion. 
---
Why do I even want to play survival when it's just battle Royale at this point? Well, not really battle Royale, seeing as everyone starts on an even playing field in them.
---
That’s a safe bet but in this case they full on lied about fixing it. In all or at least most other cases they just ignore everyone who tries to bring it up.
---
I did the same thing but pushed through.  At level 200 I can pretty much respec my character on the fly because I've unlocked so many perk cards
---
You have to have the Home Defense perk in AGI equipped for turrets. The only plans you can get are for the advanced traps.
---
Holy shit dude you fixed my camp!!! Are u on Xbox I feel like I need to reward u
---
Excellent idea.
---
Maybe it's not a bug. Maybe the world is meant to slowly fill with unmovable statues. Maybe "Rebuilding America" just means "filling it with propaganda".

there's always a jerk in a community, just like in real life.

---
Well that was a fun read! Nice to know there are actual RoboBrains working on the game and not mindless Protectrons! And can I just give a shout out to my man Biv E Ridge? Love that guy!
---
I have been getting this too. I just roll my eyes, close the app and come back in.
---
I just got a bloodied faster fire rate and that seems to be pretty dope so far
---
Plans and recipes, first ad foremost. There's one picnic table that I just \*cannot\* find anywhere and it's killing me since I've otherwise gotten a pretty full selection. (I still need one generator, but if I ever take a power plant I \*should\* get that one,s o no big.)   
---
After that, Stimpack Diffusers ... I know that they're out there but I've yet to find one.  
---
Rare outfits are next, followed by legendaries ... I more look for cheap junk legends that I can toss at the vendor right now, but I'd love to build a couple of armor sets ... Weightless Marine, for when I want stealth, and Troubleshooter Leather, for when I finally get brave enough to try a silo. My combat armor day-to-day armor's fine. I check for legendary weapons as well, hoping for that magical level 50 instigating Hunting Rifle but, as of yet, no luck.  
---
I had no idea that anyone looked for junk, chems, or ammo at all. I've tossed thousands of rounds of .308, .45, and 5.56 into the dirt over time and I never even bother picking up gunpowder (despite being very much a shooter build!) ... it's simple to craft my own bullets once a week or so to keep my stock up.   
---
I'll have to start a small "bullets here!" section in my machines, now, see who needs some stuff. Some VERY interesting comments here, for certain!  
---
(also, if y'all need plans? I gots plans, and recipes, for \*days\*.)
---
Lose and your. Also don’t expect a good pvp experience, ever. Fallout and Skyrim will always only be good for pve. Pvp is just a kinda fun thing to do on the side. Not Bethesda strong point.
---
Yes.
---
1400 day pool shared between all vendors, that resets 20 hours from your first transaction of the day since a while back, same with all vendors except Enclave being inside Whitespring.
---
Wow, from a joke to a massive thread talking about the lore of super mutants.
---
Shared pool. Changed a few patches ago.
---
All vendor bots share from the same pool after patch 6. They used to have 200c max per faction, but moved it to a shared pool for convenience.
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Back online bro
---
Flair checks out.
---
For real though I've had 80% rads for like 5 months
---
No developers advertised the backpack as working in PA to begin with, then they back-pedalled and said it wouldn’t be. Nothing about the backpack can be used in PA.
---
Sometimes rebooting the game doesn’t even help me. It always happens at the worst time possible, too.

Excavator PA gives 300 weight. Last I checked that’s more than the 120 from a backpack.
---
No slight intended at Hank Sr. No artist was represented more than once or twice. I'm also still working on the thing and might break that rule to add "I'm So Lonesome I could Cry"
---
Had the same problem yesterday when we tried to do Project Paradise - 3 drops in 30 min.
---
Edit: this was on XB1 around 9pm ET
---
I'm sure you can find the answer in one of the 5000 other asinine posts asking, the exact, same, thing.
---
&gt;until i realize he's bringing it right to me!!!
---
Still friends????? tee hee...
---
A lot of mods aren't unlocked through scrapping.
---
After reading the last post that said bc does nothing I upgraded from level 2 savvy to 3 and I'm not changing back. Only takes 2 shots to get crit back
---
Yah all of that! Need it, need it now.
---
They all charge/pay the same.
---
I thought they all gave the same for stuff. Even if they don't, I doubt it's really worth the hassle, since they all pool caps now. Use Hard Bargain and grape mentats and sell to whomever is closest.
---
As you can see below/above...this question gets ASKED A LOT! 
---
To put it simply, yes, this game is worth playing.
---
They all share the same price and cap pool. Use grape mentats and hard bargain
---
Away with you!
---
All bots have the same pricing table. Equip the Hard Bargain perk, pop a grape mentats, and sell for whatever you can get.
---
They will all give you the same price.
---
What price you get is determined by your Charisma score. In addition to that, having all three ranks of Hard Bargain helps plus Grape Mentats, pluse a beer of some type (+ to Charisma) and then any gear you are wearing that has +1 to Charisma.
---
i didn’t know! i’ve barely played this, i’m only level 18. thanks!
---
Yeah I always tried to mod them to have a yellow redish whites of the eye
---
thanks!
---
Awwww
---
Tactical nuke for obvious reasons.
---
Me too. Maybe I'll get a rare mask in the next 100+ times running that event...
---
When I first load up, I always go to a world where my CAMP can be placed where I left it last. 
---
However, when I server hop, it's 50/50. Either way, it takes a minute to try again...not that big of a deal.
---
Chemist + Butcher’s Bounty 3 + Super Duper 3 = So many Stimpacks...
---
5 Antiseptic, 1 Tick Blood, 1 Steel = 4 Stimpacks, if not more. 
---
If only the Ticks were easier to kill...
---
Yayy acid!!!
---
They can, because they made a lot off of game sales. Even if we pretend that isn’t enough, most people are buying atoms for the skins so their income won’t be affected by much.
---
his testicular deficiency probably contributes to him being over aggressive - some guys have such small pee-pees that they seem to be angry at everything and everyone
---
You use what you have... right?
---
It does seem to be taking much longer since the player vendor update.
---
Hardball journalism, right there. /s
---
had a stealth sniper build and sneaking thru AV medical center they saw me 2 floors down in the dark with chameleon Armour i was 20s at the time so broken is a good term for it.
---
A few days might not be much to a kid who’s only commitment is 6 hours a day, 5 days a week at school but for someone with a full time job and a social life it’s not easy to get all the emotes without dedicating all your free time to it for a few weeks. Not cool.
---
lol see my other post in this thread
---
I've been having this problem a lot over the last couple of weeks. Most noticeably when I'm trying to power up Posiden or Monongah.  I'll get about 2/3 of the way complete and the server will disconnect.  Sometimes randomly throughout the game and it has quickly become a big pain.
---
I really liked when you could teleport using the camera
---
It's a cool little tool they Inc.
---
Server hop, that would make sense, you want to go to as many servers as possible, regardless. But on first game entry? It's just weird. Maybe I'm over thinking it.
---
Same with me except I get it a lot more when I'm powering up the power plants. I have tried to look to see if there is a connection with XB1, but I haven't found anything.
---
Survival mode: Great in concept
---
But the game is mechanically in the wrong place, and has no balance in place
---
I am excited too- Fasnacht was one of the most fun events in the game! And I am excited to see what other events they're going to cook up for us.
---
I recommend you visit the robot vendor at Harpers Ferry, at least to be comforted by his *"soothing voice"*
---
Yeahh this is why i didnt even bother.
---
Problem since beta, but has gotten world's better since then. Was someone in a silo when the server stopped responding? That is a common cause.
---
I remembered my first legendary!.. Junkie something.. Also the day I learned that "Junkie" legendary weapons were properly named!!! 
---
Sold  that sucker to the nearest vendor.
---
sometimes im actually happy when my CAMP doesnt spawn like when im at max caps, it gives me time to buy stuff before people buy more at my vending and make me go over
---
its crazy to say that!!! before player vending the most CAPS i ever had was 9000 and i thought i was riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiich
---
Half the price of legendaries at purveyor. Flood market with 3 stars. Allow some build diversity through trial and error that way. Then start a fun pvp style, that'll probably actually make pve'ers want to pvp. 
---
Fortress mode:
---
Pick between enclave/modus or brotherhood/overseer/enclave survivor. 
---
Next, two random computers are picked on a server. 12v12. Protect those comps from being hacked.  Computer becomes spawn point and build point for custom workshop shareable between team. Whole server is open. Everything goes.  Think warsong gulch in wow. Deposit junk for builder types to build up base/upgrade units. Example: robots=enclave, reclaimed scorched for brotherhood. (Explain lore later)
---
Large budget for base. New smaller budget for forward bases. Enough for generator, few defensive structures and a couple turrets/arty. 
---
Lock card selection upon entering world.
---
Lore time.....
---
Overseer alive? Well she would be looking for other survivors right? 
---
Enclave soldier that escaped alive? I think....also looking for survivors because he was exiled.....because he was a ghoul. Intelligent ghoul, first of his kind. Retconning I know but itll make sense. 
---
They meet, fall in love.  She just lost somebody to scorched, vows to cure him with what she learns. Think of him as degrading due to condition. Injects him with vaccine for scorched....viola he is now first stable ghoul. They then want to spread vaccine and heal all the scorched. MODUS wants to stop them.  They are abominations. Instant reasons for random conflicts.
---
Sorry for format, on my phone at work. Let me know and discuss. In a little hazy on those two surviving. But would be funny in my opinion. Have seasons and everything, winners getting God-roll weapons/armor.  Like you get to pick based on rank kind of thing.
---
K
---
well put on a bathing suit, pack a lunch and make a day of it....!
---
and there you have survival mode in a nutshell. I also have a dedicated survival toon grown from L1. Lots of deaths to guys with great armor and guns. My main goal is to die with minimal shit, so the experience is not memorable for the dudes that pop over from PVE.
---
Man did I enjoy that event
---
Lol. Left switches two most recent weapons. :P
---
its been in the same "beta" state for awhile now, i think its time they listened to feedback and try something new
---
I think that's the price a vendor will give you. Your vending machine price comes up more like 150.
---
Support gunner.. Dude your my kinda guy!
---
Ammo, plans I don't have, Black Titanium, Two Shot pistols for a friend.
---
or at least level them properly for the area and whomever generated the spawn...   
---
My (elevated) camp is in the forest, a little south of Monongah.  Worst I've seen was a couple of L5 mutants taking out a few crops, and a mole that ate a manual water pump.
---
One day last week....
---
Had been in my camp for 15+ minutes futzing around with stash, building stuff, etc.  
---
No enemies at all....
---
Until a level 16 visited to check out the vending machine.
---
I carried on with what I was doing.
---
A few minutes later, gunshots - walked to the edge, looked down to see....right at the perimeter of my camp...a bunch of L30+ ghouls attacking the 16...
---
Well to be fair, us the fans are abit to blame 4 early release. Bethesda has received alotta flak over bumping back releases in past. Not to say there wasn't abit of the cashey grabbies.
---
Sooner than latter your problems will be gone then.
---
LOL I hear u, I'm at 20k rn and have someone buying up stuff. Bought a bunch of flux from a guy once, 10k worth, he went max (I felt bad, didn't think to warn him), but not by too much he said
---
Lol you think about guys' genitals a lot.
---
That’s kinda what I’m doing right now.
---
Does Radshield affect/suppress mutations?
---
Would be really cool. I've missed this event because back then fo76 could barerly run on my PC without crashing every 10 minutes
---
I DON'T SEE NO Teachers NIETHER
---
I'm in my 30s, I have a full time job and social commitments too. Getting all the emotes isn't required, it's just a nice to have. And they're what, like 100 atoms? Just keep playing when you can and you'll get there.
---
I would swap Full Charge with Bandolier because cores are easy to farm huge amounts of and ammo is heavy unless you’re using a gatling.
---
You don’t need power patcher either. Sure it slows down wear and tear but PA takes ages to break without it. When 76 was the only game I played I still only had to repair once a week despite doing SBQ fights back to back.
---
Virgil gave himself a very specific strain of FEV, likely modified genetically by himself to suit the needs of his plan.
---
Woah what gun is that? I don't think I've come across that yet.
---
Looking for something, a question, as simple as “what does your internal testing process look like and how can that be further refined to smooth the player experience?”
---
Sick bro that’s tight.
---
Interested. Send info please
---
Super low considering I vendor regulars for 10 almost every day
---
aaaand you just outed yourself as one i was referencing
---
hey some women might like your shortcoming
---
dont give up hope!
---
Thanks for the info; kinda figured most would work with it.  It's just Twisted Muscles I'm not sure of.  I wonder if anything can be datamined to figure things out.
---
And that's a Captainoob video; his 76 weapon spotlights are the shit.
---
Yeah, these new camp bugs are game breaking, I moved one of my character's and these lifted restrictions do not seem as freeing as I'd hoped for.
---
If playing "properly" and not straight farming - I dont think you'll hit daily. 
---
The scrips are an extra little bonus - not the end game slot machine system. 
---
I assume what the developers would say - makes the most sense anyways.
---
Going to take it out the oven now and eat it, you may as well take your eyes off my profile for 10 mins lol
---
Vault Raids are coming soon, all a matter of time. :)
---
I’m on xbox. So since 9:30’am til 10:37 am I’ve been disconnected from sever now 8 times. Have never had this problem this bad before.
---
Can’t remember the name, but there’s a location with a pond in the southeast of the map that has one spawn in the water quite regularly.
---
I’ve also encountered a few when fast travelling to the location east of the abandoned bog workshop in the Mire.
---
Never skip leg day.
---
That sucks, but you knew they weren't invulnerable to begin with right?  Can't expect them to last forever, and sounds like not even very long.  Just be happy you had him while you did.  You may even want to consider moving your camp to a much lower level location.
---
People saying is worth coming back should also mention the amount of bugs the game has now.
---
Ha that’s actually a good possibility, body parts tend to fall off quickly under extreme circumstances. Another reason made me think those were females is because there’s hardly any facial hairs on scorched and ghouls, all smooth. you’d think at least some of them should have a beard or something. The dead BOS soldiers and raiders do have hairs so I thought the males all died first and females got transformed.
---
It leaves them well alone. It's like a better Diluted Rad X in that regard.
---
Which makes you wonder why they brought in another studio (battle cry) that allegedly specialized in online gaming to help gear this game for PVP. I'm sure the Austin studio had to work a lot with one hand tied as Bethesda gave them strict criteria but were they ever the right studio for the job? I never played battle cry games so I cannot speak to that.
---
You're going to need lube.

---
Excellent. Thanks. Bought sone at a vendor then had second thoughts.
---
Yes, I had found the holotape that said the robots were now in charge of the calendar so expected a repeat. Sooner rather than later I imagine.
---
I bought bulk adhesive, aluminum, and lead yesterday for 20c each. 
---
I loot a LOT so I don't buy junk very often, but I had recently done a bunch of building and repairing so I was out, lol.
---
Why stop there? Your deathclaw deserves it's own cave! The cage will kill it before anything else in Appalachia.
---
You can use the same Bethesda.net account, but saves are platform-specific.
---
I don't think they've made an official release date for either topiary.
---
I don't think you can
---
No question on the (still) unstable servers, the constant crashing, constant lagging, long load times, or the broken translated versions? Ok then.
---
Just give me your money and I'll decide for you ok.
---
Please PM you debit card info.
---
It's not PvP, it's "survival" mode.
---
Yeah, that's what I gathered too.  Lore seems to make a distinction between east and west coast super mutant development, but I think most of that is just due to Interplay/Obsidian vs Bethesda writers.
---
lol thats it?
---
Very fast fire rate so furious would be pretty dope
---
I disagree. The ease with which you can create them doesn’t matter to the customer. What matters to the customer is the effectiveness of the product. 
---
Standard is twice as effective as diluted, so the price should be approximately double. Same from standard up to super. 
---
IMO, anything more than 10/20/40 is excessive. 
---
In fact, since you can get more than normal when crafting with the right perks, that’s even LESS of a reason to overcharge.
---
truth.
---
Try harpers ferry vendor. I used to see them there time to time. Always buy and put in the vending machine when they come up. Not really very rare to see, have more trouble finding the dense combat armor plan in watoga. Crazy too, the marine dense is labeled combat armor too.
---
How? Super Mutants have no genitalia.
---
So, my car has this leak, I'm not sure if it's oil or fluid, what should I do about it?
---
You must have had a decent build for that fatman.. I did the atomic badge and I had to kill 20 enemies with a nuke.
---
I remember running around in kiddie land (you know basically just outside Vault 76) with this fat-man trying to get my 20 individual scorched as they raced towards me with this slow fat-man. It was REALLY hard to get them before they got in the area where I'd kill myself. Just picture this level 200+ character trying to kill level 3's with a fatman!!!! My was team mate was laughing at me. I started out where the scorched were level 30+ but was not getting any kills. That's when I decided to go to kiddie land to do this. Even there it was kinda hard. sheseh.. I hate the fatman weapon!
---
Kind of a fun read. However, I was looking forward to more info on the next DLC.  Maybe they will have more of a reveal at E3.
---
The bad thing is it makes the stats worse. I took mine off.
---
If someone wants to jack up their price fine but think about the fact that some people, especially newer players may not know or understand how to set a price. You put an item in the vending machine and you get a pop up saying item is worth X caps. Now you go to a robot vendor to sell that and the value is significantly lower. So just because you're tired of seeing posts about prices doesnt mean someone else couldnt use this information.
---
You have no business sense whatsoever.
---
Play it again!
---
You make some good points but I'm gonna play devil's advocate...
---
Additional emotes should NOT be free. 
---
1. Outside of the freely given emotes, addtional emotes do not impact your ability to play the game effectively. 
---
2. Emotes are simple QoL animations and are a gimmick not unlike other online gaming systems
---
3. FO76 routinely gives us massive DLC, at no additional charge, which requires revenue to pay developers and support staff. 
---
4. People pay for them - so there is a demand for them which means there's a market for them.
---
5. Additional Emotes are the 2nd cheapest item(s) on the Atom Shop - per median.
---
Nope.  
---
Which sucks :(
---
The nastiest dirtiest trick I  can teach you, if you're gonna be one of those guys, use grenades and abuse the fuse. Prep a frag mirv at their feet about when you hear the event end cue (fire in the hole is THE perk for this) wait until the rewards start listing, throw grenade, watch as that little yellow arrow become red because they've still got their gun out, then watch it disappear. I swear frag mirv is more dangerous than a fat man.
---
I sell unwanted legendaries in my vendor at 10 caps per script. Nothing stays long.
---
Jesus!
---
And tumbling tumbleweeds!!
---
200 There's a bug that gives an extra 100, but I wouldn't count that in balance arguments.
---
Excavator also has abysmal DR/ER, less than even certain non PA set. If we're counting in the High Cap backpacks ER penalty then it does win out on ER, but not DR. This is not counting the whole series of perks that don't work in PA.
---
Of course, if you're using legendary armor you can't very easily just use full BOS Heavy Combat. But even then, your legendary armor is very likely giving you more benefit than you could ever get from PA.
---
All that said, this is a primarily PvE game so it doesn't make a huge deal. But man does it feel bad that PA somehow got even worse than legendary armor. I didn't even want the carry weight, after you get enough of it, it stop being particularly useful. I just wanted the friggin refrigerator.
---
It will be different for everybody that visits him.
---
This.  I run Fireproof 3 all the time simply because in PvP you have to have it and you never know what you will run into.
---
If they still only get part of the caps - this seems really pointless.
---
I agree! There should be more enemies!!! Way more, like triple!!
---
As far as I know no speed boosts stack with eachother, and speed demon takes priority. If you dont have speed demon than EP torso should work
---
Buy from vendors
---
I waited forever to do that quest because I don't care for power armor that much.  I finished the quest in about 2 hours.  I lucked in to finding 300 black titanium at a guys vending machine and then just scavenged for a bit for the rest of the pieces.  Sucks it isn't working for you.
---
Beats asking them to pay licensing fees when they could put that money towards the game itself.
---
I switched from PS4 to PC a month or two after launch (same account, two different game keys) and basically nothing carried over - not even stuff I had unlocked in the Atomic Shop...
---
I still do it from time to time but at least now I realize I’m an idiot fairly quickly.
---
Can't be on my end. Have the issue on ps4 and xbox one x. Most likely to do with how many enemies qne players are on a map at a time.
---
Well that's terrible news, because I've been doing bivs quests for a week or more trying to get that stupid recipe.
---
Hopewell Cave! I had the same thing happen, although I didn’t finish the fight with the SB because it was taking too long.
---
There once was a man who was waiting,
---
For a game to become bug free,
---
And while everyone else was playing,
---
He posted for all to see,
---
"My taste is refined and demanding,
---
My standards are through the roof,
---
In case you're not understanding,
---
Is this game GOOD?! I NEED PROOF!!"
---
But the masses lost all their fight,
---
To help this poor lad in need,
---
'Cause while it was obvious he could write,
---
It was just as obvious,
---
HE CAN'T READ!
---
I'm camping near an area that is for players around lvl 20, also i didn't expect it to last forever.. i just expected it to last more then 10 minutes
---
Fusion core costs? They are so easy to come up with. I mean, I understand not wanting to use PA as I recently left it, but fusion cores are easier than water to get Imo.
---
&gt; I'm not sure the damage boost would be worth ....
---
I'm not a bloody type person either...
---
Got that ammo covered...
---
I make only 5.56 ammo just to sell.. I use ultracite 5mm for me..
---
last night I sold 4000 rounds. I always sell at 1 cap ea because i can't sell for .5 each.
---
Exactly, they already have official threads. If official threads are on multiple platforms, then they might as well just keep scrolling through thousands of posts.
---
Great question.
---
That’s ridiculously high. IMO anything above 10/20/40 is overpriced.
---
It’s a long way to topiary.
---
1 word: Coupons. You can find through exploration of the world.
---
Gives a discount to your purchases but the vendor gets the full money.
---
Scrap some Sealed Charleston Heralds for a chance for some to drop.
---
Most of my customers are low-mid level and they typically buy 10 or so stims each. Although I have had a few 100+ level players come and buy my entire stock
---
I'm not sure what I would have paid for one.  I would've just waited to see what people offered &amp; would base my price range upon that.  If it felt outrageous then I would decline &amp; if it felt worth it, then I would buy it.  I didn't really have a set price in mind...
---
I must share the sentiment about the community in this interview. I admit that F76 was the first Fallout game I was going to pass on release for various reasons, but after the latest Wild Appalachia updates I gave it a chance and bought the game. Since then, I do not regret any single hour spent in the game and to my surprise, the community in Adventure mode was/is much more friendlier than I thought it will be. It's not about the words, but about the acts. It can be even the simplest thing like meeting somebody in the wild and waving to each other. It can be things like players selflessly donating their stuff to new players. It can be many other things, but in dozens of hours in the game I have never met any single case of griefing or a hostile behaviour. So, similarly as in the interview: Thank you, wastelanders, to be such great company! :)
---
I'd be fine with taking the shelves, making them all stashboxes and allowing you to "tag" items to show like tagging items to sell and having them appear on the shelves. 
---
Why the hell do we have all these empty shelves and magazine racks!?
---
But… what's the point? The tax exists for a reason...
---
I really have my heart set on the 50 cal but thanks for the offer!
---
Plans and cheap fusion cores
---
Same I used to only sell 2-3* weapons but didnt get much buisness due to my camp being in the west side of the forest. I put 100 stims in and buisness is booming fir stim sells and weapons.
---
My unyeilding set plus radicool gives me way more than PA could give me.
---
I hardly carry anything in survival mode cause ill just lose it. I just pick up others aid that i kill and store/use it.
---
Yea this should definitely be a thing. If some asks you about a plan or if you know a mod there is no way to know except go through the process. A list would be cool!
---
Damn was hoping there was a way.
---
Thanks anyway :)
---
&gt;not even stuff I had unlocked in the Atomic Shop...
---
That's...
---
That's depressing. 😣
---
They can't see your cap balance so that's not the reason. Probably the dumbest way to fuck over another player anyway. "I'm gonna spend a bunch of my own caps but this guy isn't gonna get any of them!" You can also exit a trade screen at any time. They can't hold you in it.
---
They probably bought them all because now they can turn around and sell them to vendors for 500. 280 caps profit for each one in like three minutes.
---
When do you use concentrated fire? I like it for my pistol guy and that 2x damage is needed but sometimes the head is like 10% to hit. I can never tell when i should take it off.
---
In pa I noticed if you pull out the camera, you end up running full speed at full health. Certain guns do this too, like the dragon and syringer. There's a cap speed, not sure exactly but you'll know it when you're running as fast as speed demon without pa on.
---
The armor pieces are no longer attached to the chassis?
---
Need help here.. what the hell is going on with Robobrains?
---
What's the lore here? pumping out smoke and only recently are they hitting me with tesla shots...
---
Maybe I'll get chance to tag an enemy, maybe, once in a dozen runs... if I can get a shot off between all the asshats in PA with explosive weapons.
---
You need acid? Have I got a tip for you...
---
would be SOOO hard to know who not to shoot at..
---
only a  small % of players visit this sub, and most of us already know the game waaaay more than casual players  i.e. an echo chamber
---
besides, there is no "right" or "wrong" price
---
My favorite is when the Whitesprings clubhouse was full of bots instead of ghouls. The bots clogged up the main entrance so i was just picking them off one at a time. Glorious!
---
ok, so who is going to start Megaton?
---
That event gave me over 3k in one day so.... whats ur tip lol
---
As Mo0kish said, no plans necessary, just upgrade Home Defense.
---
Okay cool. Not the biggest fan of speed demon anyways
---
Have they not invented big band in West Virginia yet?
---
Hella
---
Lol there you go, thinking about dicks again.
---
I know 10 people have said this but it is definitely worth investing points in hard bargain. I have a full unyielding set (the perk that gives +3 to all stars except endurance) it still makes a big difference in my prices!
---
This is actually an interesting idea, I like it.
---
I don't want them and I don't get a choice to remove the clutter.
---
Evan is scorched when you find him as well.
---
The tax is such a non issue, who cares about the 10%.
---
So basically, 10% still disappears but it’s name is just changed from tax to sale?
---
For me, levels 40-60 are the awkward phase.  You're up against tougher enemies with crappy equipment.  Keep at this character with short and long term goals.  For many players the build starts coming together between levels 80-100.
---
I don't like pvp either, but starting a new survival character to get the special weapons was a fun experience, I'd recommend it if you want a challenge
---
PC.  
---
Your gratitude is reward enough.  ;)  
---
Just share the info widely.  ;)
---
Agreed. Since classes let out for summer, i've been putting in 4-6 hours a day, doing quests, events as I notice them, wandering around, etc. Not specifically farming Legendarys basically. I have only hit the cap once (on a day when someone nuked SBQ AND Whitesprings back-to-back). Usually I'm only cashing in 40-80 a day. Maybe that is too "casual" for a lot of the people in this thread, but rolling 1.5 legendary weapons at 3\* per day seems reasonable to me.
---
Someone get this printed and framed and tell people its their grandparents.
---
218 comments! Wow this is the largest thread from something I've posted I've seen. Usually i just lurk in the shadows.
---
nothing I said was wrong. an op item will be op regardless of duping.
---
and you're the one arguing in favor of rarity for the sake of rarity.
---
You wont notice the lack of npc. Its the exact same roll that robots or supermutant vendors or listening to storynor reading story.
---
I thought it would be a big deal too... Oh how wrong i was. Im just going to say the writing and voice acting in this game is leagues ahead of fo4.
---
Hands down fo4 is the worst entry in all of fallout for me. Thought it would be this game but here we are lol. Is good dude.
---
I'm glad since I made a second character and new main after the event and what I want the most are the camp plans. I found one player selling them, but each was 1000+ while masks are relatively common to find in shops.
---
My first encounter with that one was also my first rad storm.
---
I hid in a bus while listening, not knowing what beast was going to pop out at me.
---
This is a very good build out for rifles.  Actually has me thinking about moving more points over to luck.  Hmmmm...  With the new back pack we certainly don't need all that strength anymore.
---
My only change would be Sneak rank 3 by reducing Action Boy and Marathoner to just one perk each.
---
Really? With my Unyielding bonus hard bargain adds 4 caps to the price of a golf shirt (25 vs 29 caps).
---
Mole Miners are "stuck" in their suits.. no alt apparel.
---
What makes you so sure?
---
Bloatfly syringer loop. All you need is patience. Spawn a fly, hit with the syringer, kill it, repeat all day long. Trash the glands for acid.
---
Maybe not 3000 a day... but it's an easy way to farm it
---
I think it has to do with the ai sometimes. If you aren't using a silence weapon then you are always in caution mode and enemies like super mutants start shooting at you, but if you move away from your initial shots it seems it is their ai programming to shoot were you shot at and not that they just immediately know you are there kind of thing.
---
i’m definitely going to, ive been currently building strength but i’m gonna venture out a bit. do you know off the top of your head what lock picking is under?
---
Number 1 and 7 are highly unlikely to be changed.
---
 They want you to buy Atoms, that's the whole point of the Atom shop.  They need your money to fund the game for years to come.  People like myself who don't want anything on the Atom shop need people like you who do want that stuff to spend their real money.
---
 I still have thousands of Atom's with nothing to buy.
---
2, 3 , 5, 6, 9 I agree with you.
---
4 I partially disagree. No more free fast travel. That's the chance you take. Walk if you dont want to spend caps. But I do agree there should be more of an indication of what they have.. legendaries vs crap gear no one buys...armor vs costumes ect.
---
8  I don't give 2 hoots what other people think I will launch a nuke where I want to launch a nuke.
---
10 I am indifferent.
---
Post of the day.
---
I found plans for ultracite power cores... now if I could find a plan or mod for a receiver for my laser Gatlin gun
---
So who wrote the Qs for this? It's not exactly journalistic. All the questions steer the interviewee into a positive-sounding answer.
---
I can tell you sure as shit the players would have more interesting questions to ask.
---
I don't know why you are being downvoted. It's a valid question. How about we ask some questions about the issues that have been prevalent since launch rather than this?
---
It's surprising that people still haven't seen the road map
---
will do! thanks for the suggestion.
---
I'm not playing Survival until it's out of Beta, and they presumably disallow cross-play between Adventure and Survival.
---
I hope you're ready for the milk of human kindness
---
1 item in a game doesn't affect balance.  3000 does.
---
29 guys can kick the shit out 1 no matter the weapon the single one has. 1 dude doesn't stand a chance if he's the only one missing that weapon.
---
Personally? I'm for getting rid of the shit entirely.  All the existence of this crap does is raise the bar for "average", and lead to a new arms race for the next big thing, when it all repeats again. It's game-ruining.
---
And stop being such an aggressive douche. it's a discussion, I voiced an opinion, and you respond with insults. Chill the fuck out, man.
---
thank you!!! i just started playing again so i didn’t know!
---
YAAAY
---
Not bad not bad, i usually go yao gaui hunting
---
I feel you can definitely see its influence on Free Range.
---
Bloatflies are less risk ;)
---
I did a handful of Survival play. Getting into a good, even match was fun. Getting gunned down before I have a chance to react from someone with OP weapons is pretty annoying.
---
Nice,  I'll have to try this.   Boomer never gives me the idle bombs quest,  but I want that wendigo mount
---
That would be absolutely awesome if they were working on that creative clutter was one of my key fallout 4 mods I used. They wouldnt have to worry about it causing server issues either if they just made it count against the budget they set already.
---
Not lookin at your profile, but thanks for the suggestion, bro.
---
I *think* OP means "We can price shit at 500 and get the whole 500"...
---
but as to how that constitutes a "sale", I dunno.
---
Your tiny epeen is showing.
---
I send team invites to the blast zone once i get my fancy rad suit. Mostly cause i want to fast travel there and have not explored anything east.
---
Then just be letting the sbq have it with my 10mm while guys are blasting it down with real weapons lol. And the sweet photos of the blast! 📷
---
Ohhh okay, tax evasion sale!
---
Why..? it made a LOT of sense to move the pvp'ers out.. but what makes you want to separate the high from the lows?
---
B did a wonderful job making it fun to have high peeps next to low..at level 200+ I can have fun with a level 5 player.. and we both play parts towards a goal albeit we have to do it differently.
---
not often anymore.. I used it more before I started getting legendary weapons and I was doing less damage
---
since I have been spending more time on the east of the map the glow sight has been a little more useful to me lately
---
Fasnacht was by far my absolute Highlight so far - it was so much fun celebrating with all you ladys and gents out there - Thanks for that!!
---
Sent you a message
---
Im back online now.
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking. Tap to switch weapons hold to switch fire mode, or vice versa.
---
Btw - still looking for the wall mounted switzerland flags lol
---
Very surprising indeed.
---
Yeah, I recently moved mine from near Helvetia (where it’s been since Faschnact) over to TotW as there and White Springs are definitely the two major hubs for CAMPs, and the mountain seems less likely to get nuked into orbit.
---
There's one standing up where I camp, can show you where that it depending on your platform.
---
Starting to sound like we just hopped on a WOW server...
---
meh whatever..
---
I just wish bugs and balance were higher priorities...
---
When are you ever not?
---
Get rekt. Enemies either need to spawn, or camp damage needs to be brought back. If you want a game with no consequence, Minecraft has a creative mode.
---
Fact of the matter is that CAMP destruction is a great cap sink. Completely immune CAMPs will never happen for this reason alone.
---
I have it too. I try not to look there now! Hope it does get fixed.
---
Diluteds sell for 3c with 4Chr and max hard bargin, might even get them to 5c if you had max CHR. Dont see much point in selling them for any less
---
It's a fucking Inside the Vault blog post, they're not going for a pulitzer. The fact that you see positive sounding answers as a negative speaks volumes to your own prejudice.
---
i saw low lv people in flatwood and say hell yeah, we could help out each other to lv up faster, so i wave to them from the church door frame
---
next thing i remember i was being chased by two lv4 with a machete and a shitty pipe pistol until we went too far away that they stop lmaoo
---
Fallout tactics had ghouls, mutants, raiders, reavers, deathclaws and robots I think.
---
I know this is Bethesda's franchise now, but yeah. 
---
I think adding races so to speak would add some of RP flavour that 4 was sadly missing.
---
Fasnacht in July!
---
 That's how I summon them, to my knives. ;)
---
Did you submit a ticket to Bethesda?
---
I was attacked by 3 as well one time and a bunch of charred ghouls on a separate occasion. At that point I decided to move. Best decision I ever made. Nothing big like that attacks me. I had a couple of Super Mutants attack me once. They are basically my neighbors and I test weapons on them or just go on a killing spree when they tick me off.
---
Gun-fu has absolutely no use in that sort of build so you're better of putting the extra point in adrenaline. It's not really a tank build as 6 endurance is low for hp and even with survival perks that will go quickly against harder enemies. An alpha will one shot you no poblem. It's fine though, I just wouldn't recommend standing in harms way too much.
---
Except that those of us who have spent time on building really nice CAMPs that are tied to the terrain can’t do that.  Hence my comment about the placement bugs.  
---
In other words, I can’t move my CAMP an inch or it wouldn’t set down. 
---
Floating CAMPs tide to a single foundation have their place, especially when starting out and you need to move your CAMP with you.  But there isn’t any fun in building them as there is no challenge. 
---
So yeah, being able to move them an inch to repair is not a real solution until they fix the build mode bugs (i.e. object is floating, intersects with another object, green means it’ll work, etc.).
---
I'd probably in combat use some Aid item perks in INT. I prefer marathoner to moving target personally. Also... at 12 AGI you're so close to just going a full 15 and taking Evasive. 
---
I'm going for a more balanced build here: 1H and 2H with some sneak attack bonus tossed in. If you wanted to look it over. It's a lot like yours but Less Damage and less HP as a trade off for More AP (and better AP consumption) and more physical Defense. 
---

I can prime those if your on xbox (and can deal with my ridiculous work schedule, ie waiting)
---
Also, you typically can prime the weapons the ammo is for. If you can prime Plasma Cores, you can do gatling plasmas which require Ultracite Plasma Cores
---
Reading yours though, I'd guess you can do laser pistols/rifles. I've had an Executioners Gatling Laser Prime and found it sucked compared to my Executioners Gatling Plasma Prime.
---
Im just off to watch that absolutely amazing Death Stranding trailer once again, you may as well take your eyes off my profile for 8min and 52sec lol
---
As far as I know there are no “plans” for ultracite ammo. Rather what happens (I assume) is you got and unlocked a plan for a prime receiver for a weapon that USES ultracite power cores, thereby unlocking the ultracite power core ammo recipe automatically.  The only other gun that uses plasma cores is the Gatling Plasma, so presumably you unlocked the prime receiver for the Gatling Plasma, which would explain why you can make ultracite cores but don’t have the prime plan for your laser.  If you have a gatling plasma you can check by going to a weapon workbench and seeing if you have the prime receiver unlocked for it.
---
The Hunter’s legendary also has a bonus to the SBQ.
---
Listen, I've been to West Tek...
---
So yes, I'm jealous.
---
this, looking forward to it too!
---
A few tips...
---
* You don't need to carry all the materials with you in your inventory; all crafting stations will automatically pull materials from your stash
---
* You don't need to craft the pieces at the power armor station inside Garrahan Mining Headquarters; you can craft the pieces at any power armor station (the most convenient ones are at Gorge Junkyard workshop near Vault 76, or inside The Whitespring)
---
* You don't even need to craft the pieces yourself, despite the quest's instructions; you can be gifted a set from someone else, and skip straight to pushing the button to register it and complete the quest (for anyone else reading, just make sure you've learned the plans to craft the power armor from the computer terminal first, because you can't learn them after completing the quest)
---
* After anything important in this game, leave the server, to ensure your progress gets saved
---
If you're on PC, you can message me your account name. I have a lot of steel you can have (if you're under level 45; otherwise, I have extra Excavator power armor pieces you can have if you're at least level 45).
---
If you’re just selling to vendors, then 1 Stimpack &amp; 2 Purified Waters will net you at most 20 caps. 
---
Now factor in Chemist &amp; Super Duper; you’ll average 5.2 Diluted Stimpacks; each DS can sell for up to 4 caps to a vendor. That’s 20.8 caps compared to 20, a 4% increase on average. 
---
Plus you get a base of 14 XP each time you craft them. 
---
100 Stimpacks &amp; 200 Purified Waters will vendor for 2000 caps. 
---
Converted to Diluted Stimpacks, that’s 2,080 caps and 1400 XP.   That’s 17% of what you need to level up if you’re 50-99, I believe. 
---
Even more XP if you’re Well Rested, Inspired, are some Relish, Leader bobblehead... like, +35%. So, like 1890 XP... I probably forgot some XP boosters. 
---
Point is, with the right perks, you’ll earn more caps and a good amount of XP.
---
Oh yeah bro I’ve watched it 3 times already. Can’t wait for November.
---
I just assume if something is broken in the game now, they'll never patch it. Much like the unstable servers, the lagging, the long load times, the broken translated versions, the spawn into player camps when fast traveling for vending, the unstable Arktos event, the camp floating items glitch, the camp unable to scrap certain items glitch, etc.
---
Thanks.  I’ll keep that in mind.  
---
Here I was picking up old dish rags at the Super Red Rocket and pillows from the cabins at Top of the World when I could have just been helping clean up Wavy Willard’s and the Fairgrounds...
---
someday they will land
---
and that... that day they will know what true pain means!
---
Dang, hadn't noticed, should have. /u/tiptherat
---
Good call! Didn’t consider that SBQs are also categorized by the game as “animals” but that makes complete sense. Post updated with this info, thanks!
---
\&gt;  I think some of the random encounters that went into Wild Appalachia were very fun, especially the Insult Bot who got rave reviews 
---
Content like this makes all the Fallout games ROCK!! Even end-gamers have things to run around to see. Thanks for allowing the creativity shine with all the releases.
---
The 3 scorchbeast attack usually happens at least once a week. By chance are you close to fort defiance, cause I think that has a lot to do with it.
---
There have always been bugs and bugs there always shall be.
---
To add to this, I was the one waiting to load into help her out and I was unable to load in before I was attacked by 3 scorched snallyghasters and let's just say it didn't end well for me by the time I was loaded in lol.
---
Something came up, I'm not gonna be able to be on till late tuesday. I'm 100% still interested. If your on shoot me a message MeritedNewt7538
---
Yeah...finding a good CAMP area is hard. I like to find a place and stay. I hate moving especially since I am a vendor now. You have to repost all that stuff in your machines. Ugh.....
---
Max a DS will sell for at Charisma 25 is 4 caps.
---
I hope a Fallout 76 DLC in the future puts our most important questions to bed. Like, do super mutants have dicks? The Fasnacht party next year is going to be a blast.
---
Summer is about officially here and thats when NWinter starts. I wouldn't be surprised if it dropped the following tuesday
---
&gt;1 item in a game doesn't affect balance. 3000 does.
---
of course it does. the 1 will always come up on top.
---
&gt;29 guys can kick the shit out 1 no matter the weapon the single one has. 1 dude doesn't stand a chance if he's the only one missing that weapon.
---
that's categorically untrue. maybe now with the TSE and sen/cav nerfs, but before the 1 could dominate an entire server.
---
even now, a relatively decent pvper can consistently top the leaderboards with proper equipment. someone sporting full sen/cav and legacy weapons is a lot more resilient and deals a lot more damage. and, like I said, 1 or 29, it's op all the same.
---
&gt;All the existence of this crap does is raise the bar for "average", and lead to a new arms race for the next big thing
---
then this whole discussion is moot. not that I disagree, grinding for the sake of grinding is poor game design. but, again, *you* were the one making a case for "rarity just because", not me.
---
&gt;And stop being such an aggressive douche. it's a discussion, I voiced an opinion, and you respond with insults.
---
pretty sure I never outright called you names. I should have though, considering you're so irredeemably wrong and Bethesda listens to this sub. your "opinions" can ruin my experience.
---
Say it ain't so!
---
Your statement is a paradox.
---
First you say eh it is whatever.
---
Then you say it's on your wish list.
---
Thank you ill look over it
---
I mean... It isn't like the wasteland would suddenly be enemy-free just because you aren't home.
---
It’s so sad when all that gets listed in one post lol. And that barely scratches the surface, too.
---
Nope I was near the ammo resource place.
---
I was power armor myself until I found out I could 3 shot scorchbeasta with a bloodied power fist and unyielding armor, impossible to go back man. If you have a any decent bloodied weapon stack the unyielding armor and prepare to 1 shot almost everything
---
I did my own tests and came to the same conclusion. I think the original test failed to include any damage resistance numbers. Despite the same name and level, super mutant DR varies.
---
Won't Chem Resistant negate the addiction? Thinking of doing a low strength assassin lucky junkie build
---
Make Appalachia Great Again
---
get rekt? really? are you 12 years old?
---
Ahh good to know... I’m going to check tonight
---
That Post is still my favorite post ever.   i was literally laughing in tears over that.
---
did you even read my post?
---
**I have had 2 CAMP spots on the map for months now that have been peaceful and never had anything destroyed by enemies, i have had no reason for turrets or anything, even with lots of food and lights.**
---
**However, since player vending has started, those CAMPS have been razed repeatedly, I've had to repair things each and every time i come home to my CAMPs**
---
I have have a zealots ultracite Gatling lazer ***(90% reduced weight, +10damage while aiming) I just pulled from the vendor I’m looking to trade. PS4
---
How much do you get with the full set and radicool? Not counting alcohol buffs.
---
Shortly after i made this post i saw another post where someone was asking if his pricing seems fair so there goes your first point. And never did i say there was a right or wrong price only that something is only worth what people are willing to pay
---
3* junk
---
Really, because ONE dude with an OP weapon at Fasnacht doesn't leave me without reward, I can still tag stuff, can still get a shot in. 
---
15 of them... absolutely do.
---
How do I know this? Because I've done them in both situations. ONE guy does not "dominate a server", at all.
---
And "your experience" is not "THE experience". It's not my fault you play games with non-stop FOMO. 
---
RNG would have kept the existence of OP weapons low. Dupers fucked that up. it is NOT Bethesda's fault.. it's the duper's fault.  Now, those OP weapons are the new normal, and anyone hoping to play on the same field HAS to have them.
---
"irredeemably wrong". Kiss my ass,  you sanctimonious know it all.
---
Oh F\*&amp;K I got all the time for 3\* junk
---
I nutted
---
cant access that site at work, ill make one when i get home
---
Sadly I am on Xbox, but thanks for the info! Someone somewhere out there will make good use of it I’m sure!
---
That's gotta be it because there's a fissure site really close to it lol
---
I always struggle with pricing my flux, but I have Yellowcake, Violet, and Cobalt for daaaaaaays
---
By far the best event in fo76. It would be nice to have another chance at some of the loot.
---
 Toss Barbarian and get the rest of your one hand perks in there.
---
 Fireproof in Endurance for Explosion resistance. I was laughing at exploding cars in The Whitespring yesterday as a Scorchbeast tried to disturb my troll of the Golf Club and surrounding area. I have  Dense Chest and Explosions are fun.  
---
 As you want to melee, consider sneak. I get a lot of sneak attacks in with my Combat Knives.
---
 You want Bloody Mess in Luck. Just do it. ;)
---
I'm not sure if pipe rifles have a auto .45 receiver. I have a explosive ghouls slayer .38 pipe that one tapes ghouls white springs / borrows.   Its a vats / crit build
---
doesnt negate the addiction just makes you less likelydende to get addicted.
---
on another note they fixed the addictions somewat so you can actually get them now. unsure if they presist through death though.
---
Speaking as a someone reading comics for 40 years, what a weird split in the handling of DC property. 90% offensively-bad garbage movies, 90% amazing fun t.v. portrayals.
---
Couldn’t give a crap less about almost anything coming out in the theatre anymore, but can’t wait for each new t.v. crossover.
---
Your douche is showing
---
Probably combat rifle. Submachine gun takes .45 as well, but not many mods for that one iirc.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/.45_round_(Fallout_76)
---
Okay ill sort that out
---
Im back online.
---
Yeah it looks absolutely amazing, seeing big budget AAA exclusives like that on console, is one of the reasons why i prefer console gaming over PC.
---
I found a way around this because it was annoying me as well. Just go to you camp and click repair all structures and that should force repair it. If not then i'm not sure.
---
Wow I had no idea. Thanks for the info I think I’m going to incorporate this into my build 🙏
---
Granted, but for an inside the vault I feel it's appropriate. This isn't a actual news article more of a publicity vessel that is used to directly tell players what there working on without having too much "noise"(aka hard press questions that they may not be able to answer due to non disclosure legal mumbo jumbo)
---
I look for plans/recipes almost exclusively. I will buy any and all plans/recipes I don’t already know and can afford. Make your plans cheap and I will buy them. I’ve even bought a few that I already know for friends who I think may not now them. I rarely buy anything else. 
---
The only exception is if I’m trying to build something and you have a component I need for cheap. 
---
I can barely scrape together a thousand caps, so anything over a couple hundred is not going to be purchased by me. Too rich for me. 
---
I get it that super high level guys are dropping a couple grand on stuff, but I’m not there yet.
---
What's wrong with dicks? Dicks can be fun,  I don't judge.
---
You know.  You've always known.  Deep inside, where the special place is.  Forever.
---
Power armor has a 20% speed debuff by default so emergency protocols will basically get you to normal speed out of PA.
---
 Its 20% max. No matter what you do. I use Gun Runner and carry a pistol myself.
---
I just got it today. It would have been perfect for my heavy build, if it actually worked.
---
High level player was there just before you.
---
I don't. Eat it raw, or eat... people.
---
It's warranted prejudice. We've been fucked time and again with this game. So when they blatantly choose not to communicate with us directly regarding the issues - it comes across as a giant middle finger
---
Server hop to reset the area to your level
---
Heh, I have maybe 200 lbs of scrap max. I have maybe 400-600 of heavy ordnance.(missiles, mininukes ect)
---
Mine have done that twice now when I don't join the world successfully (like crashing while loading in or infinite loading screen.) And yes, setting prices on everything again sucks.
---
Hang on, did you just suggest that we are to blame for their poor choices?
---
I can make you a bird bones serum... works great even in PA.
---
Adrenaline, tenderaiser, bloodied mess, would be something that you might want to get more damage out off your build
---
Forest is low to -mid-level. Anything east is going to be upper-mid to high. Toxic NE can be tough, as can Ash Heap, but not nearly as tough as the Mire and Cranberry Bog.
---
Wait but at full perk 2* it says full resistance to chem addiction? Is that not right?
---
Knock on wood I've had my first and only pet, a Scorched Megasloth (Hubert as I call him) since I moved my CAMP, which has been a long time. Now sometimes I wish he'd go away since he constantly spam attacks my camp. And it's loud. And repetitive. And it gives me a headache and actually makes me nauseous. But i love him.  
---
edit: one time he followed me out into the Queen Nuke Zone (?!?!) NO clue how he did this, I was panicking the whole time and people were shooting him but he didn't take damage and eventually went back to my camp.
---
I play with my friends almost every day and we just kind of do whatever comes our way- events - like the new Arktos Pharma event which has new plans like the Stimpack Diffuser and the Arktos backpack skin - Campfire tales to get possum points to upgrade the backpack - collect items to sell via player vending - then blow our caps on stuff we don't really need like new weapons to try out and outfits. If we get bored on our mains - we all have alts we switch back and forth between and level them - just got my friends alts their backpacks+cameras last night! It's much easier to always have things to do when you have a group of people to play with.
---
You just have to find stuff that you like to do because it's really different for everyone - I like collecting outfits, magazines and plans i don't know but my other friend likes to run the queen as much as he physically can lol while others spend their days chasing atom challenges - it's whatever you like really
---
Im pretty sure only most active hoarders get separate accounts. It can't be very common thing.
---
yea so you wont get addicted with it on. it doesnt supress any addictions you already have.
---
Ha! I’ve never kept a mutation, so I’m still a regular Human!
---
I rock a Automatic Bloodied FFR combat rifle that puts in the work. My opinion one of the best weapons in the game.
---
You'd have to be at a crafting table
---
meh whatever @ the downvotes part..
---
Sorry I was lying that's why I was downvoted, the game has no bugs, please come back.
---
Not sure if it was by design but I was shopping at someone's sky castle overlooking a cliff and he logged out. I had no idea how I had died for a moment.
---
Mothman cultists are blessed with attractiveness!
---
You are in an area with no max level cap need to stay in the west of the map if you want to avoid the possibility of max level enemies
---
What system are you on? I'm on xbox and camped next to one of the spawn points, so I post every time I see him. Most "I have the tourist" posts never get more than 2-3 upvotes, so if you're just looking at "hot" posts you'll never see them.
---
you're talking about pve. have you ever considered pvp? you can repeat events, as much as you want, until you manage to tag something. even back when Uranium Fever wasn't worthless and I didn't have TSEs, I would just jump servers and camp near the legendary spawn. I managed, even though I was at a tremendous disadvantage. maybe because I'm not a trash player. but mainly because pve is an entirely different beast.
---
in pvp, 1 person with access to absurdly rare and op equipment is going to dominate the server and there's **nothing** you can do about it. even if duping was never a thing, and this is the point you seem to struggle with, op is op. eventually *someone* would roll one, and that's all it takes. but it sounds like you just don't really care- so long no exploiting is involved. it doesn't matter if someone is steamrolling everyone else, he got lucky after all!
---
&gt;"irredeemably wrong", you sanctimonious know it all.
---
I better be, I spent the majority of the last 6 months playing this game. case in point: the sub moaned so loud Bethesda couldn't help but heavy hand the TSE nerf. but the sub was still squirming, so they went and nerfed sen and cav. and you know what changed? **nothing**. people here are still getting shredded in pvp.
---
so maybe, just maybe, you should listen. everything you're suggesting would do more harm than good and is of no use- at all.
---
Place a small letter wall decor on it and blueprint each individual machine. (I label what's in each machine; armor, mods, loot ....)
---
It helps the game remember it's inventory and no need to relist.
---
Doing that, I can store them and replace them and they keep inventory.
---
...Now you’re just fucking with me.
---
I'm on PS4, but I'll definitely check the new posts here more often while searching for tourist or camera.
---
You may be better off with Furious instead of Zealot's, as it's +50% vs everything at max fury where Zealot's is +30% vs Scorched. With the very high rate of fire of the UGL it should reach maximum fury in a couple of seconds. Zealot's might edge it against minor enemies but I think Furious would win for sustained dps.
---
Griefing others, bored...um,mostly they’re bored. 
---
There is no end game.  Fo76 wasn’t planned for any type of long haul.
---
These idiots thought they could make a “fortnite “ fallout where the gameplay is a repeated death rush vs other players and no real content.
---
They figured out pretty damn quickly that fallout players don’t do fortnite bs , but there really isn’t much they can do about it at this point.
---
Hell, even the atom shop garbage is all geared towards fortnite players - any idiot can tell that.
---
The truth is, this game will never really be a fallout title.   It’s a fortnite game that failed.
---
This is what happens when boardroom idiots make policies across multiple companies based on one success without knowing the user base.  
---
They should never even be allowed to do that and I think they’re getting it, but possibly too late to save pc gaming. 
---
So, no.  There is nothing to give a second chance to.  If your not using fo76 as a chat skin to hang with friends or go grief people struggling still, then there is nothing to do.
---
O, the bugs are still here and very very severe.  That shits one step forward, three steps back from this team.
---
Oh that's fine, see I ran this build in Fallout 4, took injected Psycho and psychojet if things got too hairy for example the bar situation in nuka world bar.
---
This isnt true, the majority of god tier weapons and armor being used are all duped and bought. Resetting the economy will make it take much longer for people to farm back up because they will actually have to earn good legendaries this time. The amount of players with maxed out gear will drop drastically and hopefully seasons are short enough that theres not enough time to get there before its over. Not to mention the xp exploits that are gone now that inflated peoples levels into the 300s. I dont think you understand how long it will take people to get a god tier weapon and maxed out armor without being able to buy it from the pool of duped equipment. This will also get rid of legacy weapons like exploding energy weapons that completely ruin the balance beyond what it already is.
---
I think I’ve seen raider goes up to buttressed but I’m not sure as I don’t use it
---
If you're on pc I can lend a hand whenever I'm online.
---
Didn't think floors or foundations could be destroyed...
---
I know all this thus the server hopping for hours. But thanks for the input. 🙈
---
The devs I guess changed it so taming cant be done at a distanace anymore.
---
Just replying to my no.1 fan bro ;)
---
Chambered in .45 I'd say the combat rifle.
---
I have been after a good one for a while to complement my Handmade.
---
.45 is ubiquitous where 5.56 is scarce.
---
yea junkies worked great in fo4. I miss that jet.
---
I know one of the defend ammo shop is scorchbeast attack, sometimes there are 2 in the area, same with the red rocket workshop.
---
Everytime I get a good kill in survival that nets me a lot of junk and aid I just swap straight to adventure to bank it. Theres nothing the person I killed can do about it. Theres no risk. The current system is super lame that it enables people to do that but hey ill abuse it til its changed.
---
I experience the same thing.  Frustrating.  I've tried different armor combinations but not convinced as far as a solution.
---
My god I wish I’d seen this before last night. I just sold a zealots gat to moleboy. 
---
Every zealots gets sold because nobody ever wants them.
---
Got overloaded and tried selling 35 Cherry for 5 caps. Nobody touched them for days. Yes, my spawn is fine. Yes, I’m in a moderate-high traffic area.
---
Gave up and drank them throughout a day. Needed the stash space too badly.
---
Does pipe rifle have a .45 auto receiver?
---
oh man i ll try that tonight!!!! good call! hope it works, thank you for the suggestion!
---
Yay, I loved the fasnacht parade 😎
---
So even a Nick Valentine prototype would be a no-go?
---
I have a 3* bloodied SMG that works really well.  I’d sell it if interested.
---
What level are you? You can't craft the pieces or equip them if you are below 25.
---
I love this idea. I would actually play if that’s the case.
---
It's normal and the only reason why I don't have one
---
Only 2 exist. Dima and Nick.
---
No. No to all.  
---
Dead game is dead.  That which is dead may never die, but it sure as hell isnt living either.
---
No problem hope it fixes your issue until Bethesda patch it :)
---
explosive legendaries  even though I already have them all except the laser type
---
I might have them, let me check for you. What's your IGN?
---
I fast traveled to a camp the other day, soon as I arrive I hear a boom, and all the lights went out. I knew a monster had destroyed the generator . I wanted to kill the monster then repair it for them. I searched all over the convoluted tree fortress for half an hour never found a enemy to kill or generator to fix. So whoever you are, tree dweller of the mire, I'm sorry your stuff got busted , I was still able to shop tho, power only advertises your shop . They still function normally without it.
---
No problem. Nicely written and informative post!
---
Buttressed &gt; Hardened &gt; Tempered &gt; Welded &gt; Standard.
---
Well shoot, I didn't know that. Do you know if there are any food/drinks that boost player speed?
---
I was really looking forward to the extra speed buff because I can't afford to use any points towards class freak so I could have speed demon. I've never used the mutation but it sounds like a nightmare without it. Do you think it would be worth taking it anyways with no class freak if I'm a bloodied build? I also may or may not have enough extra carry weight (still leveling so I'm not sure how much room I'll have when I'm done)
---
That is pretty unfortunate. I really don't see a reason to have one at a camp tho... You can go to Flatwoods and farm from Brahmin there.
---
ha ha
---
You can't transfer progress, when my cousin switched over to console from PC he had to start over again.
---
TL;DR version. 
---
Best vendor price for Stimpacks is 10 caps. 
---
Best vendor price for Purified Water is 5 caps. 
---
Best vendor price for Diluted Stimpacks is 4 caps. 
---
1000c + 1000c for those 100 Stimpacks &amp; 200 Purified Waters, max. 
---
Crafting Diluted Stimpacks from those with Super Duper 3 would average 520 (400 * 130%)
---
520 at 4 caps each = 2080 caps. 
---
Plus the XP you earn. 
---
It’s better to craft Diluted Stimpacks if you have Super Duper 3.
---
That is literally some expensive shit
---
i see what you did.. well played...
---
Plans, 3* legendaries, sub-100 cap garbage legendaries for scrip, and rare outfits (as in quest-only drops). I don't buy from many people, but when I do, it's exciting.
---
I assume well get the full rundown of the summer roadmap at E3. Thats why this inside the vault is just fluff to prepare for the E3 info dump.
---
Good one
---
My buddy spanwed into a camp lastnight that was set up with 4 flamethrowers at each wall and a tesla arc on the roof. No doors, or exit at all.
---
Well I guess I figured that there could have been others that, while not true Coursers or Gen 3's, would be "human-esque" enough to serve as a "race" option for the game.
---
How are you getting 12 caps from a vendor for a Stimpack?  Max with Charisma 25 should be 25% of base price, or 10 caps.
---
Its the cow that eats up the budget. What a bunch of bullshit...
---
I suppose that's an idea. I really only see the extra speed mattering in PvP and I already have two points in agility. I could just have it out while I'm sprinting and then switch to my melee
---
Those giant ticks are pretty gross.
---
High 300s-low 400s depending.
---
Shit.  
---
Pa is already weak ass crap vs x6 three mod legendary items = shit game balance and then they go and remove backpacks from pa too...
---
Wtf.  Pa is only used for a str boost on melee and a wtf moment seriously, a perk card for heavy weapons.
---
Anyone developing the game who thinks that six pieces of gear with three mods each is weaker than a single Armour that eats up an ammo to run and gives less overall defense with its only merits being a str boost and a requirement due to a single must have heavy weapons perk isn’t worth his position, but here we are.  
---
If I didn’t main heavy weapons I’d actually laugh .
---
Are you able to do buttressed on a raider leg by chance?
---
&gt; "The community has done a great job of providing us with valuable feedback"
---
Translation: "The number of reports about bugs, broken things, wrong design choices and inconsistencies was overwhelming."
---
Hard Bargain doesn’t have anything to do with player vending machines.
---
Lmao.
---
My play time depends on if I'm solo or if friends are online. Solo, I hop on, check/cash out the robo vendors, hit up some camps to see what they're selling, look to see if any fun events are happening, and then drop a nuke to restock on flux. I  like the challenge of speed running a silo by myself and trying to improve my time. My best run is just under 15 minutes (no exploits), but I think I can probably shave another minute off that.
---
If friends are on, I just bounce around with them doing whatever it is they want to do. Finish quests, go farming for mats or ammo they need, claim workshops, help them remodel their camp, whatever.
---
yes did you hear about the other method ...it involves the long load in while you are getting attacked before you can move
---
I’d happily take it if you still had it.
---
I spent five hours (from midnight to 5 am during insomnia) hopping the ice cream stand trying to get it, and only got the bot three times.
---
It's because it brings a whole NPC with it (the Brahmin).
---
You can read that at any train station, and build it in your camp.
---
Have you even played the fucking game?
---
Yeah, I'd definitely recommend it. I have marsupial, speed demon, and adrenal reaction on my bloodied build and don't use class freak. You do have to eat and drink a lot but there's food literally everywhere so it's not a big deal. I'd recommend all three of those mutations, actually.
---
I'm not aware of any food that buffs movement speed.
---
ITS A TRAP!!!
---
 I walk a lot. My char was born to farm and he did. To the point I kinda burned out on fast travel and started walking.
---
 I shoot low and mid level stuff with my Pistol, but just for jollies. I don't look on it like its a real weapon, more a travel aid. ;).
---
Exactly.  The motto of fallout 76.
---
Man, my first thing if I were just coming back would be checking out player vending. I've gotten some sweet loot through that, and sold so much stuff I had to turn my vending machines off lol. 
---
A few new quests, too, which were pretty fun. 
---
What level are you, and what platform? People can probably help with the higher level stuff if you're still a bit squishy.
---
I'd have to say no then.  I have way too much time invested in my character to do the grind again.
---
I deleted mine and just have a bunch of rotten food  and  craft fertilizer when I need it.
---
Lol that's just mean. That's why I book ass away from the camp before it finishes spawning
---
Plant crops. Harvest. Use only what you immediately need. Let the reds spoil. Craft fertilizer. Repeat. 
---
My adhesive farm ends up making more fertilizer than adhesive. I’ve never run out and usually bulk sell 3-5 a day.
---
I can honestly say at lvl 333 i need nothing atm. Mostly checking for plans i might be missing .
---
Do you constantly need other people to tell you what to do with your life when it comes to other things as well? Do you go ask strangers if you should go out with a girl even you like her? You have the damn game, play it yourself for an hour and make your own decisions.
---
try to all weapon weight reduction pieces, you can carry more than 20 guns. fully modded, including 7 heavy guns.
---
Very good point, problem is this one is definitely my favorite - by far. I assume switching between receivers is as easy as materials, so at that point it's really just about timing... 
---
Meh, I'll wait. I appreciate the input about non-schorched enemies - definitely a decision swayer there.
---
As soon as they get done sketching more fortnite skins for the atom shop, which is to say never.
---
I agree. I only wanted to install it for a possum badge challenge, and I thought I'd just be able to delete a couple statues or something.
---
I was gonna say that!
---
L E T  G O . . .
---
Container?  Just pick one out of stash (or two if your one of those that thinks turning in two at a time gives better rewards- I’m on the fence myself), take it to turn in, drop on ground, pick up, turn in quickly 
---
Did all my huge stack that way.
---
Where are you located?
---
I can assure that you haven't completed the game yet. I (similar to you) gave up on Fallout 76 a few weeks after release date due to reasons alike. I decided to get back into Fallout 76 about 3 days ago only to come back a few months later with a boatload of challenges. Go to your map, select challenges, and you will see numerous challenges in about every section, including Social, World, Weekly, Daily, etc. + there are more secret quests around the map as well.
---
I keep so much of scrap so I can mod stuff before selling it. And the majority of it is stuff for laser weapons. Crystals, copper and that stuff. The heaviest amount of something I have is: vegetarian ham, cajan rice and beans, canned coffee and  that stuff.

Its bugged again atm . I tried with 37 agility , 3 sneak cards and 1 chameleon piece. Still could not loose danger as before
---
Usually i dont use the cha piece and sneak cards , and i can sneak around enemies around their faces without trouble
---
Somewhat agree. The limits could be based on totals on account.
---
I tried it but all I got was a three star wood armor piece.
---
I use a bloodied Gatling sometimes. I keep thinking I should go Ultracite with it. But I shy away at all those added ultracite runs in addition to the steel, acid, and lead runs I already have to do.
---
Not as bad as the minigun, but still chews through the resources. I have not found Ultracite 5mm for sale. I might go that route and see how it goes if I did.

It would be really cool if there was maybe a semiannual contest or something for fanart posters to be submitted for consideration as in-game posters.
---
All the bells and whistles add up to disappointment. I haven't been playing my solo char as much due to it. I used to breeze through zones going about my business sneak attacking left and right not getting myself into serious danger. Nowadays it's every session I have 3 scorchbeasts TRACKING ME or a horde of X just KNOWS where I am and comes at me 3-6 at a time full sprint.
---
Yeah, he's a bloodied build too. Didn't help his case, lol
---
oh, well, this is just propaganda.
---
No one is going to be so stupid to consider it like anything else...
---
I tried it and got a furious explosive reduced weight assaultron head.
---
0 x 2 = 0 LOL
---
My buddy does crazy damage with sneak on the queen but latly he doesn't always seem to get it to trigger and he's deffinatly an expert at it, saves me SOOO much ammo lol. Also explosive perk Is bugged also and sometimes doesn't work. Really noticeable sudden drops in dmg, I go from melting puny mutants in a flash with my 50cal to wondering if a whole clip will be enough to finish em off.
---
Indeed. I'll place some flowers by my Topiary too. );
---
Do you always take Psycho before posting?
---
Any reason why they dont have it in fo76?
---
This is a ridiculous work around to excuse not adding chat
---
Also, that means deaf people would have to *unlock* the letters plan and craft a sign to put a discord steps. That inconvenient as hell.
---
Yes, we understand it is a workaround. But people are asking for a feature that exists in most multiplayer games. Nobody is asking for crude workarounds because they shouldn't have to do that.
---
well there was a bug with them they actually always had teslas they just didn't fire the smoke is actually riot control gas that hurts you if you get into it 
---
the basic background is they needed supervisors and since the tech they use doesn't have microchips the robots are well dumb so they jammed a human brain in a tin can and boom robo brain they were supposed to be cloned or grown but they actually couldn't grow them so they took convicts mind wiped them and jammed them into the tin can's they kept wiping them which generally caused them to go crazy and thus why the automatatron dlc's robobrains were psyco nut jobs in fallout 4
---
that said people who were put into robo brains volunteer and didn't get the wipes were actually generally pretty stable and could live for hundreds of years
---
Wait. Is the +30 in addition to the carry bonus he backpack had before the mod?
---
I don’t think they can be. Maybe roofs were used?
---
If you are asking a serious question, no. You can't. This is a glitched super mutant. He has no weapon or armor on, just stands there
---
All NPC vendors buy at the same amount. Max is 25% of the base price (if you have Charisma of 25), minimum is 10% (at Charisma of 1). 
---
Purchase price is similar; 175% of base at Charisma 25 and 250% of base price at Charisma 1.  
---
Recommend a Charisma stat of 9 (that way you could Team Share up to a level 3 perk card). 
---
Get Grape Mentats (+5 Charisma for 10 minutes), Hard Bargain 3 (+9 Charisma for buying/selling at vendor), and make some Mothman Egg Omelets (+2 Charisma).   That puts you at 25 Charisma. There are other ways to boost Charisma, but these are the easiest &amp; most reliable. 
---
Save up all the stuff you want to sell. 
---
Go to the vendor.
---
Equip Hard Bargain 3. 
---
Pop the Omelet &amp; Grape ‘Tats. 
---
Sell all your wares.   If the vendor runs out of caps, check for things you may want to purchase. If you buy something for 100 caps, 25 go back into the vendor for your sales. That’s why you should always sell before you buy; the max caps vendor’s will have us 1400 (shared across all vendors in the game; resets every 20 hours from when you made your first vendor transaction). 
---
Good luck, and happy selling!
---
What the hell are you talkin about you wrote all that but all of its made up and nothing like fortnite.. at all
---
1. As far as I can tell through this game's data spaghetti, Ultracite Gatling Lasers do not have any specific bonus against Scorched. 
---
2. Prime receivers are +25% against Scorched, Scorchbeasts and SBQ. Multiplicative with everything else.
---
3. Scorched Killer receivers are defined for the 10mm pistol, pipe gun, 10mm SMG, assault rifle, combat rifle, combat shotgun, double barrel shotgun, handmade rifle, hunting rifle, SMG, lever rifle and pump shotgun. I can't guarantee that all of these are unlockable. Sadly they're useless because the -20% is applied before the +50%, so they deal slightly less damage against scorched than a hardened receiver.
---
Gross. I usually have the Master volume or my TV set low so the differences in normal vs atomic shop aren’t as obvious.
---
probably my friend marcoo he already has a shrine to a exploding statue so seems like megatons cult will be the next step 
---
also the master (nightkins) wasn't in fallout 3 it was fallout 1 and the main enemy of fallout 2 was the enclave
---
 Its a crap shoot. I do it all the time and you can get lots and you can get almost none. 
---
 It appears that its server wide as I have found rich times at The Whitespring usually mean lots of Legendaries in Harper's Ferry underground.
---
 If I am getting none or very few I will server hop.
---
Wow this thread got toxic really fast. Wandering and exploring new things is the key to enjoying this game for me. But if you finished everything you possibly can. You kind of answered your own question. If you like doing the daily weekly challenges, helping out other players and farming then there is still plenty to do.
---
Which comment, this one?
---
"Same comment on every god damn survival post, Get over it already. "
---
Yeah I'm tired of seeing people say that too.  It's so unhelpful to the conversation!
---
You're in the part of the sandbox that the big kids frequent, lol. In all seriousness though, probably passing through higher lvl players spawns that weren't killed would be my guess.
---
Yeah I highly recommend using a cliff or large lake or such. It limits the approaches to your camp making your limited defences far more effective. My camp gets decent amount of visitors from vending and I rarely have to repair anything.
---
I personally like being above the cliff but below works too, and might even allow building some nice stairs.
---
Also I think fixed spawn points(locations) reduce spawning, if they are close enough so no spawn point could be between it and your camp, while being far enough so that whatever is there, won't attack your camp. I have fairly high level enemies that spawn in nearby roadside toilet stop, but they are just far enough not to care about my camp.
---
Why do you need to ask others if you should give the game a second chance or not? It is not easier to fire up your PC/console and play for 20 minutes than to make a reddit post, wait for replies and engage in point-counterpoit with them for an hour?
---
Wait, does the Enclave vendor have a separate pool or different reset time?  I wasn’t aware of that.
---
This looks like one of the more recent threads on this responder vendor - I'm looking for Ranger Outfit clean, and gotten him to spawn at Charleston RR (can never get him north of the bridge or Lady Janets for some reason) - and while I've seen hunter's long coat, I haven't once seen Ranger Outfit Clean that I'm after - is this bot still got this outfit in the list? tia &lt;3
---
Oh my god, so many wasted hangovers.
---
Move away from whitesprings Station then.
---
&gt; I never played battle cry games so I cannot speak to that.
---
That's probably because they never released a game before Bethesda bought them.
---
This happens a lot to me as well your best bet is to get the marsupial mutation along with starch jeans and it will help you combat against higher enemies by allowing you to be places where they have a harder time attacking you.
---
Switching receivers is usually not a great option because the prime receiver costs 4 stable flux to install. Maybe if the gun uses a different type and you have tons spare.
---
It’s better everywhere to work 12hr days four days a week.
---
I fought like hell to get seniority to do that over the years.  Should be a basic option.
---
8 hr days are really10-12 hr days with ready time, transit, transit, breakdown (multiple definitions) and then a short “rest” every damn day nonstop.  Humans aren’t ment for that shit. 
---
Gimme four days of hard labor followed by a single sleep day and two to three days of my time.
---
Well.. shit.
---
Thanks, appreciate it!
---
Counterpoint: As a fully employed adult, you likely have some discretionary income that you could use to purchase Atoms. 
---
Time is Money, friend.
---
I got a 3* bloodied ultracite gatling laser if you are on ps4 and still looking.  Bonuses to vats targeting ap costs and fire rate.
---
*shitheads* - Rose of Sharon Cassidy
---
I play because I like my routine honestly LOL always in search of a better melee weapon or range weapon sometimes I play solo, sometimes I play with friends I'm not looking for the best big mind-blowing game every 3 months like a little kid with ADHD.
---
It's a good game with replay value and I like Fallout Aesthetics that's about it.
---
If you didn't like the game way back when you're probably not going to like it now at least not for more than a couple weeks. Yes it's more stable and they got a few more tricks up their sleeve but basically it's still the same game.
---
Yes happened to me a couple times whitesprings is an interesting place lol
---
*Someone there?*
---
Im just going to put the kettle on for a hot drink, you may as well take your eyes off my profile for 2 mins lol
---
Thanks. I did not want to be toxic, I hoped to see something good it the game. I missed and just got insulted instead.
---
Valuable input jaj - I appreciate you ✌
---
* Cheap (less than 100 caps) 1-star legendaries to scrip
---
* Plans that I do not know
---
* Steals on nearly anything that is grotesquely underpriced
---
You can only share 1 perk card at a time
---
Whose to say?  I’m mean really. They ALWAYS bring more bugs than they fix.  
---
It’s how this dev group operates.
---
What they had to do was kill legendaries and force the people to start a survival only character.
---
Sorry I don't follow this, how do you spawn a fly?
---
The combat rifle costs 26 AP semi auto, 13 AP full auto. For comparison, everyone's favorite handmade rifle costs a whopping ~34 AP semi auto, ~17 full auto. 
---
The combat rifle is a superior vats weapon.
---
Even with 15 charisma? Just can use a 5 point perk card to share?
---
That's not surprising. It's promotional material, not journalism.
---
Yup
---
Thank you. That's reassuring.
---
That's lame o.o
---
Well played!!!!!!!!
---
just from memory?  That's a lot better than I could have done in an hour!!
---
You can only share one card, it would definitely be a nice idea tho to share two cards. Otherwise ill just stick to my maximum of 6 CHR point's.
---
I’ll try my best.
---
If you were looking for journalism you came to the wrong place my dude.
---
Read you twit.  It was DESIGNED to PLAY like fortnite. 
---
It’s pretty damn obvious that at the beginning it was a genuine fo title.
---
It’s also obvious that an idiot in a boardroom heard of it and demanded fortnite from it, which they then tried.
---
If you can’t read between the lines and see this than your obviously too young for this conversation.
---
Go nap and let the adults talk kid.
---
&gt;Fasnacht Parade
---
I'm upset I had to miss it! Looks/sounds like it was a grand adventure.
---
Ikr
---
Na you could have an overpowered team if you could share more than 1 perk card. You could already have a really good team with 1 if you're smart about it.
---
Oof. Not looking forward to losing my blackbird power armor paint.. that’s actually fucked up that MTX don’t carry over....
---
Nitpick:  There's no such place as White Springs.  It is The Whitespring.
---
But yes, the ghouls are all kinds of screwed up lately.  Wrong names, wrong poses, wrong loot.
---
Got it, thanks mate
---
I remember that day too. When I was like you know what, how hard are you to kill anyway? 
---
This was pre eternal screaming so very hard but I shot that sucker out of the sky.
---
No
---
It’s a male I have tried it on a female.
---
Do you know if I can share a +20% damage card and my buddy who has the same card equipped still gets the buff or can you not double up?
---
griefing still happens in adventure mode sadly.  the excuse is "lol how else am i supposed to get junk?".  IDK, PLAY THE GAME LIKE THE REST OF US?!?!?!
---
i understand the pvp system, but its silly that i STILL cant own the ammo actory for less than 20 minutes before someone steals it.... after its been unclaimed for the last 2 hours
---
I understand. Just pick it up and give it a try. If anything play with some friends. I've noticed a lot of high levels actually are pretty good at helping lower levels out which keeps their mind busy and gives them something to do. It makes the game fun for us lower levels as well playing with someone who is more experienced and knows the good items to go for.
---
if they make atoms to easy or over rewarding then no one would buy atoms, they want people to buy atoms as often as possible to generate more $$$ flowing into bethesdas coffers. thats why every week or two you are going to see the all new shiney for 12-1800 atoms, (more than could be easily made in a week or two) to get the whales to buy the new thing every week and have to purchase atoms to make up for what they couldnt scrape together through challenges. i personally dont pay attention to challenges and in my opinion most of the atom shop stuff is trash, i really dont like the 50's era stylings.. so my purchases has mainly be PA and weapons skins with my most recent purchases being 3 of the horsemen skins (didnt care for looks of plague). currently sitting at like 190 atoms, but would have no problem droppin 10 or 20$ on atoms if it was something appealing.  
---
i would love to be able to tell if the camp actually had legendaries or not, hat spending 50 caps to other side of the map to find some witch costumes and straight jackets. i dont mind paying but would much rather know what i am paying for.  
---
far as nukes i drop it all over the place, just to see what will happen or what i can find. or looking for flux always looking for a better flux farm.
---
subpardeity, il be on around 6 est
---
Shutting down and restarting worked for me.
---
What power?
---
The handmade is heavier than the combat rifle? Jesus... that's just nuts.
---
because the assets are already all in place, so they will just straight up use them, timeline be damned.  thats how we have all the same creatures from fallout 4, despite it being 200 years earlier.
---
if we are lucky, they will make up some contrived reason as to why Appalachia has Synths when it should be impossible, just like they did with the super mutants, BoS, Power Armors, etc.
---
If we are unlucky (99% possiblity), we will get zero explanation, just like how deathclaws, brahmin, fog crawlers, etc all some how exist so soon after the great war, in an area with practically no radiation.
---
I’d rather listen to Johnny guitar than a good man and that “I DIDNT KNOW THE GUN WAS LOADED” over and over and over holy fuck
---
They don’t stack anymore :(
---
It would be nice to have one, especially as a WV resident.  Still, given the game's problematic launch I kinda doubt they want to devote any resources to that.
---
White Springs
---
~~i can't tell if you're agreeing with me or mocking me. I'll reply as though you're agreeing.~~
---
If stabilized didn't require PA, I don't think I'd use PA anymore.
---
I just hope Legendary PA comes sooner than later. It's in Mumrgh's pay out table so I'm hopeful, and there's a datamined set of legendary t60 that's a quest reward iirc. Even if it's just one star (I'd honestly prefer that it be 2* max. Fighting against Protocols and 6 pieces of sentinel sounds ridiculous)
---
I uh... yes.  Yes this absolutely happened.  Bethesda get on this please!!
---
Whitespring and where else?
---
Well I would try to explain that hardcore players will get that gear and armor and power level level up to 100 in a week.
---
While me and any normal player with a job will be level 5 still running away from ghouls and getting recked by others.
---
At least now you have an option to get better  adventure then only join survival when you are ready.
---
But I will be down voted anyway so what's the point
---
Yes hence why I messed up his front arms and legs so badly. And thank you!
---
Found out you can use those bait mines to make them land.
---
One other thing. The game makes you keep one point in the bank when it comes to sharing. 
---
If you want to share a 3 point card, your charisma must be at 10. For 5 points, you have to be at 16
---
Im convinced that it brings in more enemies as well.
---
Where my camp was I'd see a few scorched or the Chinese bots I can never remember the name of.
---
Put in the fertilizer thing, bam my house is no getting snipped my max level mutants.
---
Scrapped it cause the stupid cow wasn't giving me milk &amp; fertilizer is incredibly easy to find. No more mutant attacks.
---
I’ve checked vendors too
---
Sadly that's how it goes nowadays apparently xD Find a way to exploit it to force the developers to fix it if they neglected it during it's "it's just a bug"-phase
---
So far I’ve had issues with it and I know of at least one other poster mentioning this too. I think both of us were XBox people too. Idk what it is, but it’s frustrating!
---
Just heads up, you can get the reduced fall damage effect on arms and chests now too. Any two pieces will make you immune to fall damage.
---
That's pretty damn good for 5 minutes- don't sell yourself short!
---
I wanna say yes, because with strange in numbers I could fly with myn equipped and my friends sharing it but its been a while since we did that. So Idk if that still works, like the guy above said.
---
The perks won’t stack if they already have the same card equipped.
---
The hair on scorched is patchy at best. But I think that has something to do with getting covered in scales and crystal-like protuberances.
---
Ghouls have hair until it all falls out with the rest of their skin. That’s why the ghoul named Snowflake (I think) in Fallout 3’s Underworld is happy you show up. He was a barber but can’t cut ghouls’ hair without just cutting the flesh from their scalp. He’s super stoked to cut your hair because you still have some.
---
Plus, Fallout made two distinct ghoul voices for males and females. Both are raspy, but the male voice is noticeably deeper. I think it’s easy to assume they’re all females in FO76 because there are currently only feral ghouls.
---
The scorched only have one voice sound from what I’ve been able to tell. Must be something to do with the disease or the theory that the disease creates a hive mind so those afflicted are no longer individuals so that when they talk you’re really hearing the voice of the SBQ, which is female but also a bat monster. Maybe she’s a psychic bat monster?
---
I want those big creepy totems with the vines and sheep skulls
---
Like the other guy said, it would definitely take longer than a week to get full sets of sentinel assassin and stuff.  That took players months, even with duping and trading.  In survival, trading is much less common, and if there's no duping then it's so much harder to come by.  Starting from scratch would take months to get to the levels and gear people are at now.  The leveling part is probably accurate, lvl100 in a week, but without stupid good gear it's not an insane advantage.  I think the point holds true on a long enough scale, and eventually everyone will be outclassed by those players, but to say it would take a week is just not true.
---
I wouldn't bother with most Sheepsquach stuff.  Sell those quills at an ordinary vendor.
---
I've never had much luck selling Bulk junk, myself.  Things like Screws and Ballistic Fiber move sometimes though.
---
Definitely no, both are major modifiers
---
Key words being At Least, but yea its ridiculous.
---
I feel you on that waiting for the right moment
---
Lol weird how that works. Every other day im totally empty on colas. But i have had 50 stims for 7 caps all week and no one wants em.
---
They would work really well with the totems they just released but the bigger ones do look better!
---
I always thought we weren't allowed to vats flying bugs since they were flying I guess, but all this time it was just a bug.
---
its a multiplayer game and a timeslowing drug that you can use whenever you want makes it very unfair and unbalanced. so they didnt bring it over.
---
It is super dumb that most alcohol only sells to a vendor for one cap. I'm not saying it should have a crazy high value but it should at least sell for the sum of its parts plus a few caps for the time it takes to ferment. Like maybe 8-10 caps total.
---

My go to post on this sort of thing.  If anyone has a better link would love to see it.
---
There’s so much more I just can’t think of it right now but I’ll add as I go!
---
He's not your man, bro.
---
Happened to me after the last bug fix.
---
Yeah sometimes these threads get ok responses and sometimes they don't - really do try picking it back up- there's still bugs but they're not that bad most of the time. Try to find some good people to hang out it- made it a lot better for me.
---
lmfao. dead game is dead for a reason. and it's not because of the fallout.
---
Just add them as atom shop items, boom profit.** Junk bundle pack ** **
---
Honestly, they should do this at normal vendors/ammo vending machines too.  If you are in dire need of rounds, they only tend to carry a dozen at best, and an exorbitant cost.
---
Ok what about new player that will buy the game after two months or even one year one where most got the best gear.
---
One of my favorites is when the ghouls raise one arm in the air at WS lol it's like "Here I'am"!
---
Honestly, I set my prices the way I'd buy them. Not too high and not too low, my prices normally fall on the lower end but I want to help people more than make tons of money.
---
Im just going to nip out for a quick smoke, you may want to take your eyes off my profile for 5min lol
---
I sell steel, wood, leather, glass, and other super common materials for .5 caps each, so 15 caps for bulk steel (30 units), 7 caps for bulk glass (15 units), etc. Adhesive, acid, gears, screws, etc are priced at 25-30, and things that can't be bulked are generally 1-3 caps each depending on rarity.
---
The only thing I sell for more than that is ballistic fiber for 10 caps, partly because it's a bitch to gather in large quantities, and also because it you buy it from the vendor your'e paying ~28 caps each, so 10 seems fair.
---
Sounds like you found a no lifer...yes it's sad
---
I'll give my answer in the form of a story. My father is into very old music, so I played Butcher Pete for him the first time I heard it.  He got about 30 seconds into the song and told me to turn off that &lt;racially insensitive term&gt; music.
---
His bigotry is hardly unique for the region, and I'd imagine it would carry through into the Fallout universe, a universe where the worst American traits were on full display before the war, let alone after.
---
Country music in the 50's and 60's stayed apart from Rock partially for racist reasons - rock being descended from jazz. Eminem of all people touches on this in his song "Without Me" with the lyric, "But I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley who touch black music for himself see and used it to get myself wealthy..."
---
I'm not saying this is a good or right thing. I'm saying it's a realistic thing. It's also complicated - there are after all black country musicians, though they are as rare as white rappers at the very least.
---
Even in my childhood, in the 90's, Country music stayed well apart from Rock, R&amp;D and Pop; even in the social circles the performers stayed to. People who listen to Country tend not to listen to the others, and did so deliberately.
---
Back to the topic of the Forum, Fallout '76. I think that a station that calls itself Appalachian Radio would stick to country. The big band music would be on another channel - even GNR since it's not inconceivable for that signal to reach at least the eastern side of the map on the AM band range.
---
Maybe I can stash a few beret as they've had a tendency to vanish from my character :/
---
Stop looking at my private place,... perv
---
That's not been my experience. I have 9 charisma and have no problem sharing level 3 rad sponge or inspirational. If you can't share a level 3 card when you're at 9 CHR it's probably because you have an invisible addiction that's lowering your stats. Pop an addictol and it should fix the problem.
---
If you want to experience that event afterwards just listen to the event music during your Fallout play [https://youtu.be/hqe3MRb3StY](https://youtu.be/hqe3MRb3StY) :p
---
“Solid Perks” would be subjective of the person who is shopping. Depending on build.. Same goes for flux, also subjective.
---
I guess I'm thinking of private servers like Minecraft where you can have godly control. I'm curious how they will balance or limit private servers
---
The market is already flooded with 3 stars. I've been dumping them in my machine dirt cheap to get rid of them when I need weight. Some guy got a bloodied critical +50DR gauss rifle the other night from me for 900 caps with a heap of 2mmEC for free because I got tired of how much the ammo weighed.
---
Yup, I've been getting 8-12 legendaries per run later.
---
Craft a bloatfly syringer.
---
Shoot an enemy with it as your first shot, then kill that enemy. A bloatfly will spawn from their body.
---
Shoot that fly with the syringer to "seed" another bloatfly… then switch to a *MELEE* weapon (melee kills seem to result in a greater drop rate for Bloatfly Glands, than ranged weapons do)… kill that fly, and it spawn *another* fly. Shoot it with the syringer…
---
repeat until you get bored. Then take all those bloatfly glands, and junk them for acid.
---
Ah I get'cha.  Ya pretty much same. If I'm really desperate to lose wieght I just become a wasteland Santa... dressed like a wierd crow man tho.
---
That's what they do, though... lol

Skyrim/Skyrim LE &gt; Skyrim SE &gt; Skyrim VR

And as you implied, there are some past bugs which have apparently returned, so it just seems to fit with how Bethesda operates as of late! :P
---
Excellent thanks, will try this tomorrow.
---
paying 1c per round of anything but ultracite or plasma cartridges is just not happening, for me.  that's just dumb.
---
I think it drops the weight of other chassis in your inventory
---
Yeah I'm not seeing how that invalidates my response. Nobody had reason to spawn to your camp then, so no enemies spawned except for when you did. Now that vending has started, people have reason to spawn at your camp. This can be garnered from reading your post. There's no reason that enemies shouldn't spawn at player bases. It's the wasteland. There are enemies. It's PvE. Enemies are the E. Your base is part of the P.
---
When you're wearing it, you carry the full armor weight. If you store the chassis in your inventory with all the pieces on it, it only weighs 10 pounds
---
Always looking for flux but rarely see it at camp vending. Currently I’m looking for Cobalt. I could farm it but if it’s at a camp vendor, likely just gonna buy it..
---
Sweet. I am singlehandledly trying to bring the Syringer to popularity. I love the damn weapon. it doesn't deserve it's rep as a "garbage" weapon at all.
---
Hey mate you wouldn't happen to know if the Zeolots handmade +30% equipped with an  anti scorch receiver+50% would stack too give 80% extra damage to scorch would you??
---
Agreeing.  I fing hate what they’ve done to pa.
---
I can’t hold my breath on a fix because if they didn’t code pa pieces to be legendary by now, they never will.
---
They just need to tweak that perk card to not just be in pa and I’ll vendor every last damn set I have.
---
Yes but you putting then in the machine literally means it's no longer in the system.  Another mans trash is someone else's treasure sort of thing. And one anecdote of people in your circle, does not equate my experience. And my guess is most other people's experience. Sure I have 3 stars, but they kinda suck. I've gotten 3-4 this week. None of them usable among my two toons. I've posted them for sale, and they are still up there. One week in the rotation and they are gone.
---
Just ran into my first snallygaster the other day, scared the shit out of me. Thank you for a reminder, lol.
---
Im back online now
---
FUCK. No one wins in limited timed seasonal events. The Fasnacht event is getting the wrong signals from the "success". I'm really disappointed in the reaction from Beth/Reddit.
---
When sailed fails on server is usually cause you're buying to much of different things
---
Or to fast after opening machine
---
&gt;them so they took convicts mind wiped them and jammed them into the tin can's they kept wiping them which generally caused them to go crazy and thus why the automatatron dlc's robobrains were psyco nut jobs in fallout 4
---
I think it's more subtle.
---
The automatatron robobrains don't really seem evil by human standards. They don't seem to have any personalities. 
---
It's just their interpretation on how to best help humans. They were portrayed as ruthless utilitarians just doing their job.
---
its still pretty tedious garbage, but there is almost enough to keep you   going.  the amount of bugs is still pretty staggering.  i keep myself entertained by grinding caps and figuring out how to satisfy my ammo whore habit.
---
Thats kinda what fallout used to be?
---
Screw that I'm sticking with Fisto.
---
Yeah maybe
---
The thing is concentrated fire perk would be giving you 10% more damage per shot in vats up to 30% after 3 shots with rank 3. So you wouldnt be able to see the furious as clearly.
---
Realistically just put it at 0 caps. Only ammo you really want to pay for is cores, .50, 5.56 and maybe .308. 
---
Everything else is so cheap it’s worth it to not sell for caps.
---
Love!
---
I don't think weight has any baring on AP cost. I tested a weight reduction perk for heavy weapons and nothing changed. It seems only attachments effect AP cost. Everyone weapon has a base AP cost. The combat and radium rifles are just naturally cheaper than the handmade and assault rifles.
---
Nope. 1 card.
---
With 15 charisma, you can share up to, and including, ONE  5* card.
---
Yes it was serious, I have only put an hour into this game. I'm gonna come back soon, once I get live and beat some these game pass games. But I didn't know if there was an update I missed reading or something.
---
Thank u very much bro !! It was really helpfull
---
Community should Stop asking for useless gimmicks. F76 need a big expansion asap and a proper endgame.
---
Reading most of the comments just makes me more certain in my decision to never bother with survival.
---
I got griefed enough back in vanilla WoW for leveling as a resto druid. 😶
---
been all over that area near mill, no sign of his bloated blue arse lol
---
Nope. I shared a 3* card with a 9 CHA. Never noticed this "1 pt in the bank thing".
---
All normal scraps at 1 cap and the rarer stuff at 5 caps per
---
They’re my favorite new enemy from fallout 76. I love crazy they look and I was pretty sad that they don’t have centaurs anymore
---
I like this idea
---
Thanks for putting the time into this.  At some point I'm going to make a crit based build, so this info is invaluable to future me :)
---
This is the best "username checks out" themed joke I have ever seen.
---
i can tell you are trying too hard, it shows.  
---
your response is invalidated, again, because of your lack of reading comprehension.
---
no enemies spawned in when it was just me for months, i had 2 CAMPS where i never had enemies spawn in, in fact it seems i found spots where the actual spawns were harmless creatures like squirrels and cats
---
but no enemies.  in the whole time i have been at those locations.
---
do you get it yet?
---
honestly, it seems you just want to argue for no reason. 
---
i however, do not.  life is too short and its friday to be argueing with a random antagonistic person on the internet.
---
 so i say to you, good day.
---
They do actually change clothing - there's some generic clothes for those out in the world but you do see like all the scorched in the hospitals are typically wearing nurse outfits etc although I do think a little more variety would be good - and in addition to the scorched -the ghouls as well. where the BOS clothed ghouls at? fort defiance is full of ghouls... naked naked ghouls
---
furious caps out at 50% increase after 10 shots so it would be very good. bloodied would be better since you can get up to 95% increase at 5%hp.
---
Yeah, I'm not going to read this.
---
Are we getting Pioneer Scout Squirrel badges?
---
I do it for shotgun shells since plastic is a huge pain in the ass to get
---
That’s an impressive time, specially solo.
---
That’s kind off what I’m currently doing, thing is we both have all our quests done, and he lives being in Whitesprings all the time.
---
Oh well....
---
You can farm .308 cartridges all day though... seems like Super Mutants carry the crap almost exclusively in the forest and nearby areas.
---
Platform? Also, will you consider doing this again?
---
I'm literally levelling an alt for the sole purpose of being able to double up my scrip income :P
---
the community is absolutely carrying this garbage game.  it sure aint the designers/devs.
---
that makes sense. I was trying to buy a bit over 1,000 rounds of .45
---
There can only be one.
---
Right, and there are definitely ski Scorched too.  But for the most part, when I think of the Scorched, I think of the green jumpsuits.
---
Same game different problems
---
Yeah but you know people are lazy and highly aren’t going to be bothered to do so.
---
Cult of the mothman...I wouldn't call that regular. :-P
---
i used to have a thing for plastic until i found that charging sniper lasers off the supermutants scrap for 10 plastic each with scrapper perk.  now i never pick up or pay for plastic.   copper, though, is still a whorebitch.
---
So I decided to unplug my tv, router and xbox. Gave them a good 5 min timeout. Restarted and played for a hr problem free.  Go figure.  :)
---
What the hell? I just explained my line of thinking and you got all defensive, sarcastic, and condescending. There's no reason any place in the wasteland should be safe. Not everybody is obligated to agree with you. If enemies attack my camp, no matter the reason, it's just part of the game. I repair and move on. There's no reason to start being rude and trying to insult people. It's a frickin' video game.
---
I see that and I'll raise you that at full build budget I took down 1 regular poster and was able to build a pool table. Somehow one poster has the same value as a pool table
---
Top of the World
---
I believe they mentioned in last week's Inside the Vault the next batch of DLC info would come at E3.
---
Bulked ammo should be great. But 1 cap for 10 rounds? Oh boy. If prices ever get that bad I would stop selling ammo lol.
---
Heh, true. And I imagine most people don’t go around in cultist gear and a plague doctor mask either. 
---
Yay, I’m weird! :p
---
whats that sposed to mean
---
Reboot your system will fix this. As well as not camping in a popular spot like the lake at whitesprings. When I lived there it was about 50% of the time I had to server hop.
---
Or a laughing emote
---
Oh yeah. Those posters are going to build up at the train stations the more DLC we get.
---
Isn't that what survival is, being aware of others, your surroundings etc? Yes some guns are op but are there not guns in real life that can one shot you or every gun just about?
---
Ah. Yeah I did see those. I thought they did bug fixes every Tuesday.
---
Will do, thanks for letting me know
---
I hate super mutants, so damn annoying!
---
I got that defending the workshop in Berkeley often...sometimes I can get them with grenades...nuka's work best.
---
I sell 556 and 308 pretty easily at 1c each. Lazy people buy because it's still better than having to waste perks and time crafting their own. And if they're lazy rich people they buy bulk for the good prices.
---
What’s your build? I’ve been running shotguns for aaaaages &amp; ditched tse in favour of situationally dependant loadouts.
---
When you kill something and can't loot it but can pose with it, that's better loot anyhow.
---
Are you on PC or console
---
At least on Xbox, you’d probably get a report for unsporting behavior or harassment.
---
I'm nowhere near that place
---
I have a new gouhlfriend... things are getting pretty serious
---
"Properly" is abit subjective. Cause I'm always overflowing with legendarys, and admittadly do farm runs, but only once or twice a day, and more so as an RNG test before I spend scrip. So I can see the benefit in increasing refresh rate, cause I'm heavily conditioned to never drop a legendary from Fo4.
---
Oh boy. I guess I'll have to go back to all of them because I have no idea. :/  
---
Is there somewhere specific I should look?
---
Which is why all ammo has value.
---
1 cap per cartridge... or farm it yourself. THAT is why ALL ammo has value. 
---
Sure, on paper... 1 cap per when compared to amount of mats required, blahblahblah… but none of that matters to the average player. 
---
Value in this game (and most like it) translates to "time spent playing". 
---
Personally, I think 1 cap per is totally fair. I can farm caps way faster than I can farm mats for ammo.
---
I think low levels could benefit from that. 
---
When I play with my low level mule every place I go, even if there's no player around, is mostly high level enemies. High levels don't generally seem to care to kill everything so those enemies spawn, then they stay for quite long.
---
Granted with a mule, I go to placed most low levels won't actively go. I can use 50 caps on fast travel no problem, I've died plenty of times not to worry it too much.
---
I wear the robes of a preacher and the mask that makes me look like a killer so weird is relative but I bet you scare the crap out of people fresh out of the vault.
---
I’ve seen it a couple times. On the plus side if you’re there you can’t fail the event, and they do eventually pop out of whatever floor/wall they’re hidden in.
---
if we're talking real life examples there this is going to be a very long conversation. going to ignore that part. 
---
Being aware of surroundings doesn't help much when I fast travel to Vault 76 and there is a dude on top of it that shoots people when they spawn and his gun is so OP that it kills you in one shot. 
---
This has happened a lot, and literally nothing you can do except just not re-spawn there.
---
Don't get greedy now.
---
Ehh. 50% of vendor-bot pricing, at most.
---
True, similar to how the ghouls at whitesprings are sometimes wearing golf outfits.    
---
But the problem is this is very limited and only a few areas have "costumed" scorched.  Imo it should be the rule that scorched wear outfits and armors not the exception :)
---
Gotcha, you on PS4, PC or Xbox?
---
Yes, I had this happen last night. Got 90+ scrip from one lap.
---
You need to pick a different location. That one is obviously crazy popular.
---
PC. Played Fo4 on PS4 it was terrible. 😂
---
that's cool, i feel ya.  there are a lot of rich people who are always near cap limit and to each their own.  i'm just saying, for me, i'd never ever pay 1c per bullet for non-prime (or plasma carts).

I think seasons with a character and gear locked in to that season would be a great idea for survival, the main reason I don't play it much now is because I got into the game late and I feel like I'm so far behind everyone else gearing up. Not really up for fighting full sentinel assassin's guys and loosing the caps I'm grinding to try to get that top tear gear
---
Ya,... that sometimes happens... I once had several gouls get up and start moonwalking about the burrows. It was unsettling.
---
Its probably cause you don't have sentinel
---
im gonna have a holy child with a cazador
---
Are you on Xbox? I can set you up with some black titanium scrap just let me know
---
Yep...last several times...looking for solution now
---
Me too
---
Instead of compounding, the bonuses might be reflecting the base damage. So Having say a rifleman perk isn't included in the BC or drug effects.
---
Unyielding armor is amazing for sneak, VATS, or melee builds. Sneak, because high Agility makes you nearly invisible to enemies. VATS, because high Perception means 95% chance to hit most of the time and high Agility means a ton of action points for shots. Melee, because every extra point in Strength is an extra 5% of damage.
---
High Agility also means to can sprint forever and high Strength means you can carry all of the things.
---
But if you run a low health build you pretty much have to make room for Blocker, Lone Wanderer, and Serendipity in your build. You also have to accept that you're gonna die sometimes and you might lose some junk every now and then. But it's a super fun way to play so I'd recommend giving it a try.
---
Masterpiece!
---
Maybe a system of ranking, so the strong fight against the strong and the weak fight against eachother.
---
Can only share one card at a time, but it also doesn’t matter how many perks you spent on charisma. What matters is how high your charisma stat is on your stats page of the pipboy. Gear and buffs can let you shar higher perks but diseases and addictions can block you from sharing as well.
---
There’s a lot of sense in rolling 2* armor over 3*. It basically follows the same rule as weapons. 3* armor is endgame gear for when your armor is already pretty solid.
---
For example I am hunting full unyielding/powered armor for a bloodied melee build. I don’t sprint much or stand still in combat so it doesn’t make sense to pay more scrip to try and roll for sentinel/cavaliers (an additional 30 scrip on a 1/6 chance) when I can just buy two more pieces of 2* armor instead. 
---
Once I have full unyielding/powered then it makes more sense to start rolling 3*.
---
Does anybody know if the Zeolots handmade +30% damage equipped with a anti scorch receiver +50% damage  would stack too make +80% extra damage to scorch??
---
and I'm on PS4. lol
---
I was wondering why all quests are so boring and generic. Now I know. Looks like that Lead Quest Designer has no personal gaming experience at all. Just checking her linkedin. Previous working experience: Canadian Cancer society.
---
Interesting concept. Great to know! Thing is you lose the bonus if you miss one shot, so I see the trade off possibilities either way. Thanks for the info!
---
The power of VOODOO
---
That sounds like something sandman would do
---
Don't worry! Official text chat is probably soon going to hit the Atomshop! You get the chat panel and the first letter for free but have to pay for the rest of the alphabet though
---
I think the Survival Mode should have had everyone start from scratch in that mode.
---
Happened to me the other day. Admittedly a lot of the drops were 1 star though. But you can't complain. One other thing I noticed was that some of the ghouls were non legendary.
---
Someone with a camp like this was nice enough to show me that with birdbones and two pieces of fall damage reduction armor I take absolutely zero damage falling from the top of the cliff by the monorail elevator.
---
Now I've been making a point to jump off the balcony at every cliff vendor I go to like a crazy person.
---
I call this a legendary server. Seems to happen as a server gets closer to being taken down for reboot. Usually the server isn't full. When this happens, either run WS as many times as you can, or hit other legendary hotspots like Westek, Harper's Ferry, Steakhouse, etc. You'll see a higher drop there as well. Sometimes on these servers I get multiple legendaries from a single body. But be quick because these servers usually don't stay up for very long after this starts happening.
---
A buddy and I just tried it last night out of curiosity. Looking for people as well, for some semi-regular attempts. Have mics and discord. What's your Char name?

..hurm..typical Raider.

High Luck, Agi, Str build. I get Class Freak from a friend sharing it.

Holy shit is that true? I've been scrounging cat bowls each week without knowing that. Thanks for the tip. I use the steel yard workshop and sell the steel, keeping the copper

The map gets harder the more SE you go.
---
I look for legendaries and clothes I don’t have. Ammo that sells for me: 5.56, shotgun shells, .50, and .45 almost consistently. 
---
Legendary armor and weapons too but you won’t get a good amount of caps if you overprice your weapons and armor.

K, this guy's definitly in need of a padded room and a snug coat, Stat!

Couldn't agree more.

---
Don't know why you're downvoting this post... everything stated is 100% true.
---
If you are ALREADY on the quest, you can have NO MORE THAN 1 Technical Data on you. 
---
My main character has the quest, and my Alt does not. In the early days of that alt, I would transfer all of them to my main (via friend who I play with) and be all happy that I now had 15 to go deliver! Except... I go there, and noticed after having fast-traveled that there's a "Technical Data" item under where I'm standing that despite having the "Collect" option... doesn't ever let you pick it up.
---
Low and behold, I reach the turn in and look at my Inventory where I... only have 1 Technical Data.   
---
Took me about 5 exchanges before I realized you can't have multiple on you **if you're on the quest**. 
---
My alt, who is *not* on the quest, currently has 175 on her.
---
This is intentional as it would seem, because I decided I might as well sell some of them in my Vendor... I put up 10 and, not knowing a good price, listed it at 1000 each. That worked, showed 10 available.   
---
Someone comes and to my surprise, actually bought them all; however, seems that might have been partially a glitch, and they only bought one. Because I look in my Stash and now there were 9, no longer for sale. 
---
To make matters even stranger, the next day when I logged in, now my Vendor had magically re-listed **ONE** of them, and 8 were still not-for sale in my Stash. As such, it would appear that they've put in a safeguard to prevent players who are on the quest from buying multiples, only to be able to have 1 in their inventory.
---
**TL;DR -** McSaltMaker is correct, and Bethesda even put safegaurds in place with Player Vendors to prevent anyone currently on the quest from buying multiple Technical Data items for that exact reason. 
---
And the solution is also indeed to drop or place in a container (NOT your Stash) to re-trigger the quest each time. There are multiple containers right around the deposit box, and even one *directly* under it. 
---
**But I suggest** that if you have multiple in your Stash, to *just take one out*, otherwise you risk them being lost after fast traveling!
---
Thank you!
---
regular DResist is useless by itself. you'd need upwards of 1000 to feel a difference, probably a lot more. more or less the same with end/hp.
---
what you want is %DReduce, like emergency protocols. DR(esist) is only useful to protect against the "chip" damage that gets through your DR(educe).
---
You know what they say, you can do anything once and it’ll be forgotten, but the one time you fuck a mole rat you’re a ratfucker for the rest of your life.
---
How much are you willing to pay? I've got at least one of every plan that I've been saving.
---
Centaur! That’s it! It’s been awhile!
---
I wish the devs would acknowledge just once - just one single time - that the game still has its fair share of problems and disappointing shortcomings, that they're aware of it and that they're actually working on resolving these issues as soon as possible. 
---
Is that really too much to ask for? 
---
And I'm not talking about Mr. Howard telling us as a side note at Pax East that some "difficulties" they had during development "unfortunately showed up on screen"...
---
So a full bolstering sentinel would tank most of the damage?? Considering 5 pieces of sentinel is 75% damage reduction. + 20% from lonewanderer
---
okey
---
You loose more caps if you get killed in adventure than in survival now which is ridiculous
---
I forget where I found it, but there's a holotape about the BoS hunting down a group of ferals, but the person recording says "but I think they still retain what makes them human, is this actually okay?"
---
And then I found some compound with a bunch of dead non-feral ghouls, one had a holotape of her pleading with people to leave them alone, they're still human, they're not feral. Pleading specifically with, I think, a BoS guy she had known before.
---
I'm just going to get this one out of the way before anyone else makes another stupid comment.
---
YES, they're aware of the bugs that we've been discussing (complaining) about for awhile now.
---
NO, they're not sitting on their thumbs doing nothing. It takes time to figure out where a problem comes from in the code and considering they're dealing with very old code mixed with new code its going to take time to fix issues.
---
I'll end this with a little rhyme other coders know. "99 bugs in the code, 99 bugs. Take one down, patch it around.."
---
"129 bugs in the code."
---
Survival without legendaries would be an incredible PvP experience. Without legendaries, it’d be a lot more like Rust, but more forgiving AND with better pve encounters. Survival without legendaries would be a lot more balanced, and perk builds would actually matter beyond the one that reduces explosion damage. Survival without legendaries is exactly what I want out of fo76.
---
I don't think players wanting to be super mutants, ghouls or robots really care to think balance at all. I think "races" could be implemented, but it would have to be well balanced. 
---
Or one just becomes retarted meta and anyone making an actual chose based on character, would just be fucked by poor balance. 
---
And seeing how well balanced guns, melee and various legendary effects are right now...Bethesda is not the slightlest fit, to make races balanced. So I will say no too until they get other things balanced.
---
Yeah, you should definitely stop wasting Bethesda's time with those reports.
---
No legendaries
---
At watoga or west tek
---
Makes me really sad
---
Perception mate
---
You can leave the event area. Then you will get the retake the workbench. Whatever was stuck has gone away for me and new creatures spawn for me. The payoff is sometimes better for retaking a workbench than the defense. YMMV
---
Nah only when theres an actual bug uodate, sometimes they'll do smaller patches where they target 1 specific bug or exploit or improve server stability
---
You may find that you need to go back, see the sergeant and finalize your training.
---
Most ppl dont lose any caps in adventure mode tho..
---
I did!
---
well atleast it seems alot better for you guys on PS4 now than it did at release. :)
---
Yeah thats the mission i was talking about, you start it in Harper's ferry
---
I wish I was lucky in finding instigating weapons. I just started belly of the beast and used chameleon to sneak past 5 SB  to get to the transponders but extremely low  on ammo and doubt I'll be finishing this quest right now. So need to prepare my self trying to finishing this BoS quest 😅
---
it's not 75%, the bonus is multiplicative and not additive. so it's more like 45% for a full set. and keep in mind it's been nerfed so there's a chance each piece won't trigger.
---
but yeah, except for pvp (assassin's), bolstering is probably the best you can get for a bloodied build if you don't want/need unyielding.
---
I do 5/15/20 and seems to do well enough
---
Nerd Rage will work well with a bloodied build too
---
Can the bloatfly spawn as a legendary?
---
Illustrating once again that ignorance is a choice.
---
what does your latest quest marker say?
---
Not really. The whole point is that it is more dangerous. And if you kill someone you get more caps
---
Oh, I didn't start it there, I just stumbled across it, haha
---
Are you on ps4?
---
“Accuse” “and I did” seems to me it’s not a accusation or a claim but a fact. That’s your fault
---
Getting the mayor's stamp is bugged and you need to know where to go.
---
It’s whatever you like it to be. I’m just trying to get rid of what I have. Selling mine for 50 caps with a few takers since player vending began.
---
&gt; and if there's no duping 
---
duping still works. Each time they "fix" it, the dupers find a way around the fix in about 10 minutes. Until they fix the server database lag from disconnects, duping will stay around.
---
You can get 1400 caps everyday from vendors which is easy to get if you just farm an area (pick up everything and sell it). Events usually drop legendaries
---
The music always reminded me of the Original "dawn of the Dead" mall music ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksR0wDS-L\_c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksR0wDS-L_c)).
---
That's not true. When you are wearing it the armor weighs nothing. The weight you are seeing is probably the weight of your regular armor. So, no. The perk only affects PA that is unequipped and in your inventory.
---
Surely you don't expect them to rework the spawns on a map of this size? Being able to build almost anywhere is a dynamic system and so are the enemies that spawn around the map and/or your potential CAMP.
---
What if your CAMP is near a specific spawn point that other players like to farm? Should the nearby enemies not spawn anymore because of your CAMP placement? That's a bit selfish.
---
Having enemies spawn near your CAMP when someone fast travels to it is just one of the many compromises you have to accept when the game has so many dynamic systems working simultaneously.
---
Or put on green thumb while running through the forest picking flowers.
---
no ofc not its the same.
---
are you kidding me? its so much better than launch.
---
Would be great if you could build your camp right next to peoples camps who are in your team. Like a small village.
---
I mean there's an off button
---
Turn this record over, you ain’t heard nuthin yet.
---
I mainly run so there’s not too much of a crossover with what you’re aiming for but I’d probably up adrenaline to rank 3 &amp; drop gun fu to rank 1. 
---
 Maybe drop inspirational &amp; up your shotgun base damage. 
---
 Also running first aid &amp; nerd rage seems counterproductive, maybe invest in auto stim armour instead or emergency protocols if you’re going PA. 
---
 As for legendaries, bloodied will get you the highest damage output, or AAE for all round.
---
as long as no one is nutting

Obviously but all the other songs are decent. Guess I gotta sit in silence once and a while.

For that soothing voice

they could just make it so enemies DONT spawn in automatically whenever anyone fast travels in...
---
they made the game,you seem to think it is non adjustable?
---
With all the times I get one shot by sassy teenagers barging in my workshop with a shitty attitude, it makes the whole idea of Survival Mode seem worse than Chinese water torture. Why has practically every PVP shooter always full of assholes? Like I thought it was bad in the CS 1.6  days... But it definitely got worse. People who have an insatiable desires to exploit and bully will always complicate things it seems. Putting in seasons or making people have Survival bound characters would just be putting a bandaid on a broken leg.
---
Do a few daily junk/scrap/bulk sell runs for ammo production and caps mixed with runs at whitesprings golf club. Also westec, burrows and pharma are good for the rotation.

Oh, right. My bad. Since they’re in the bunker I never really separated them in my mind, lol.

The Free States always have your back citizen!

Yea, been having alot of fun with it despite all of the crappy coverage and publicity it got.
---
Cheap legendaries to scrip. (max of 100 caps per star) I hate farming legendaries.
---
Rare outfits and plans. Especially event-only drops. I will pay a premium for these.
---
Project Paradise loot. The event is too hard to solo and not enough people are playing it right now to farm the rewards efficiently.
---
Good legendary items: bloodied, 2-shot, exploding, instigating, anti-armor, or quad on weapons and chameleon or unyielding on armor.
---
Cheap chems (less than 1/2 of base value)
---
Cheap fusion and plasma cores. Less than 100c for fusion and less than 50c for plasma
---
Yes, I know I'm cheap.
---
I think its just when youre used to a gaming pc going back to a PS4 becomes weird. So it was probably a personal preference.
---
Lmao i had the same thing happen to me, and took the same pic with the same pose LMFAO

Where can I find a guy like that

Asking for a friend 
---
The friend is me 
---
I’m lonely
---
Did you even ready my reply? If your CAMP is near someone's favourite farming spot then that's a problem. It prevents enemies from spawning there. Don't you see that as a problem?
---
I've also got a heavy build, and this saddens me a whole lot. apart from not being able to aim straight, and I haven't even had a drink yet.
---
Thanks for the feedback. You're right. I actually have 2 points in Adrenaline and don't run Born Survivor. Any insights into the accuracy issues with shotguns?
---
Right back at you.
---
Commenting for the learns

*Asking for a friend with radworms*
---
If it's a popular legendary effect like bloodied, instigating, furious, maybe mutant's, anything explosive, unyielding or chameleon for combat or marine armor, you can probably sell it fairly quick in your vendor. Anything else you'll probably be better off recycling.
---
I usually give things 3-5 days in the vendor. If they don't sell they get scrip'd.
---
The SBs I can understand.  They're mutated bats, bats see with sonar.  The rest are a bit suspect though.  I'm almost  3 times the level of every mob in the game I should be able to stealth past ANYTHING especially if I spend 4 perks to max it out and tweak it before gear. And it's not an agi issue either I run 14 agi after mutations. Pretty sure they tweaked something somewhere too and didnt say anything cause I ran a stealth build to 50 and never had issues.
---
Lol. Maybe make a spotify playlist of the ones you like? That might help you out. ^-^
---
whackin' his meat.
---
What is your build?  
---
But generally speaking I'd suggest focusing on earning easy trash legendaries.  Horde events, uranium fever, one violent night, etc.
---
Search for tips on horde and one violent night: there are guides to maximize your legendary items.  
---
Whitesprings is another area for easy legendaries as it's mostly ghouls that are easy to take down.  
---
The idea here is you are unlikely to find good legendaries via the above though you might get lucky.  Rather, the idea is to generate SCRIP for the purveyor.  You can easily get 150 scrip per day in a couple hours with the above strategy.  
---
If you literally have no legendary items of any kind I'd probably start off buying 2\* with scrip as you can get a lot more bang for the buck.  Once you have a couple decent gear you can then start going for 3\*.
---
As for caps imo this is the easiest thing possible to acquire.  Go to any area where enemies use guns like assault rifles and just kill everything, take all the guns and any chems or other items you can sell.  then hump all that shit to a vendor and sell it all with "hard bargain" rank 3 equipped.  You will easily earn the full 1400 caps per day and if you focus on just earning caps and not spending you'll get to 25k max caps in no time.
---
Actually a good idea and then I can throw some New Vegas and FO3 songs in there. Thank you stranger
---
What you see in your  Pip-Boy is at full charge :) (from a Gauss old timer) lol
---
You should only let Bethesda use this if they give us all a free copy for our camps. Or buy the art from you to sell in the Atomic Shop.
---
There was centaurs?
---
Beatin’ his meat like a POW
---
The feature I was most looking forward to was Junk Decorating. Player Vending ended up satisfying me in ways I never thought possible but it would be nice for them to at least update us. If Junk Decorating still has issues to work out, just tell us Bethesda.
---
Listed damage is for a full charge. You get about half damage for an uncharged shot.
---
It was truly the only server wide event. Everyone knew it was for a limited time, so everyone would be there.
---
Mac's are lame for gaming or so I hear, I don't want to take the time or effort to find out, usually remote playing on my Macbook though.
---
This made me laugh!  AND now that song is stuck in my head...
---
When will they learn
---
And clicking to read the poster gives a prompt to fast travel to their camp!
---
I really like the no legendaries idea in survival. It makes the fighting legit skill, and no special effects being in control of the outcome.
---
Loot Server. That's what I call it.  I hop until I find where Whitesprings ghouls drop a ton a legendaries like this.  When you find a loot server, you stay on it and farm it to shreds.  That's how I farmed my TSE handmade at West Tek.   Just hope that the server doesn't kick you or you'll have to find another 'loot' server.
---
Charge what ya want to :)
---
Its incredibly reasonable to exceptionally reasonable depending on the legendary stats. I'd be chuffed to get a 3* unyielding or something for 225c just saying
---
Uranium fever, arktos pharma, awol armaments, encryptid, horde events, and the golf club are where I usually farm for legendaries. 
---
Once you do them enough you’ll learn when and where they spawn. 
---
Also with vending I’m finding quite a lot of decent to good roll legendaries prices way below what they would be on market.
---
Yeah skill vs luck I would love skill to be the deciding factor
---
I’ve easily spent 5k in caps today at vendors across App buying them. They’ve averaged about 65-70c per star so it’s not bad in my opinion.
---
Play on xbox. Less problems. But seriously, are you sure its not ypur connection? Or psn? I know its not as fast and solid as Xbox live but i thought it was stable enough.
---
It certainly seems to boost the damage but I've don't no testing or really paying much attention.
---
I just base it on if I quick fire at a lvl 68 mutant it won't drop in one, but if I hold it they will. Maybe the extra second or two is just allowing me to better place the shot, hard to say.
---
Replying for the heck of it.
---
Im just nipping over to my cousins (he's a bit of a PC gamer like you) so you may want to take your eyes off my profile for around 30mins lol
---
Sounds a bit low, but it depends on the weapon
---
10 reasons why Minigunners might disagree.
---
Number 6 will shock you.
---
It's splitting the stack best I can tell. If you remove them all, on by one, it'll restack properly in characters inventory.
---
Kind of a chore when you've got 80+ for sale.
---
I’ll of course double check my claim when I get home, but can’t share 3 points if it doesn’t say 10 cha when I open my pip
---
Yeah thats why i asked since he/she wrote that they have one
---
Are u ps4
---
Who do?
---
I mean, all we have to go off of, is how other games have done it. Private servers and public servers have mostly been separated as far as I've seen. Perhaps you can import your character at the owners discretion into private.. but I doubt they'll let you pull from a private to public.
---
Pretty sure they are additive based on the weapon base damage and not multiplicative.
---
PC mainly but also on XBOX
---
It's one of the silos. Alpha, Bravo, Charlie ... Charlie is south near the end of the raider railway line
---
No. You can't loose more than 50 caps on survival.
---
Not really a PC gamer but cool.
---
I don't know what that receiver is but it will stack
---
Really? Ok. Guess I was wrong then is it the same in adventure mode also?
---
Depends on how bad someone wants one I guess... I've sold a few for closer to 500 caps and I've sold a couple as low as 185 caps. Depends on the economy and the supply/demand.
---
since most of us don't carry rando pieces and we stash our extra frames, its' not that useful.  Being "in" a suit make it weight zero. The energy weapon ammo one is nice to drop the weight of the fusion cores down though. It's probably a more useful perk if you want an alternative.
---

You take that back, that lady screaming like a chicken is a tinnitus trigger and the song deserves the cruelest of deaths.
---
That's strange... because, I recall, very clearly... me being excited to share my 15% Xp bonus with my buddy when I finally put the 9th pt in to CHA.
---
PC?
---
Why not hahaha
---
I was a combat rifle guy all the way up until 2 weeks ago when I got a BE Submachinegun.  Fell in love with that Tommy gun feel and sound.  Wish I had found it sooner.  Has a ton of mods including hardened reciever (still an automatic though) and the extended drum holds 62 bullets.
---
k I would have went to ur camp
---
yup
---
Camps take too long to load, almost a full 30 seconds till my camp renders so basically unplayable
---
I'm not really sure but I think you loose more in adventure
---
The last patch really dropped a steamer on explosive shotguns/shotguns, you really need to get up close &amp; personal now. 
---
 TS/TSE have always sucked in terms of accuracy, particularly in VATS. You’re better off avoiding TS in favour of another prefix. 
---
 Another thought, if you can drop bandolier in favour of blocker, you’ll really up your survivability. 
---
For reference this is my solo build.

---
hmm depends really. but if youre having a good time without to low fps and not to much stuttering I’d just keep at it. If I didnt have my computer I prolly would’ve gone PS4.
---
Hey, there's gotta be a cost to stuff. Besides...we run the very real risk of this game becoming a "rich get richer" kinda thing lately.
---
Have a lot of caps, can afford to fast travel, buy everything you find at a cheap deal, sell, repeat.
---
While the low level players have to walk, farm, etc... can't get the cheap stuff, because, well.. it's gone by the time they get to the vendor...
---
They do if they pvp
---
I logged out about a half an hour ago can anybody tell me if its worth picking back up?!
---
You have to find it in the world...yeah. Not too easy.
---
Good call! I'll have to do that.
---
Beaver badges coming soon.
---
It’s guys like you I love, one mans trash is another mans treasure.   Someone sold a TSE pistol for 750, flipped it for $8,000
---
Sweet rolls and mothman egg omelettes are also good CHA boosters and they stack with grape mentats, hard bargain, etc.
---
I dunno, but I would like to know the state of it since 7:30 AM MST, May 31st, 2019.
---
I've been trying to sort my build over the past few days. When I was playing before I just got what ever perks sounded like I needed them. Barely any max level cards.
---
I've been getting a rifle build set up with tank killer, rifle expert, covert op etc. It's going to take a bit of effort to get it all sorted.
---
Wasn't sure if vendors were worth it. I know before they had some silly small caps limit, I'm guessing that has changed.
---
I just want it out of my stash space. LOL
---
See, where you went wrong was you stopped to sleep. There have been too many changes since last night to list here. I can however, direct you to Bethesda's site for a full comprehensive listing of all the changes.
---
Lemme tell you about a Ranger, with a big iron on his hip.
---
Because one stimpack with chemist gives you 4 diluted, with super duper you get even more. At 3 caps each you can make more then 12caps per a stimpack.
---
You must have a charisma debuff from something.
---
Yes it tends to be the players who play the game who ensure people are playing the game, that is how player numbers work
---
I don't think so... but I guarantee some player that treats this game like a business is running to sell it online for 10 times that.
---
I usually set my prices at 25% of the base price, often rounded off to the nearest 9 to minimize tax losses. (Why charge my customer that extra cap if I’m not going to get it myself?)
---
25% of base price is the most I could sell it for to a vendor bot, so that’s the basis of my logic. 
---
So, like Bulk Steel (30 units, 36 caps base price) I sell for 9 caps).  
---
Bulk Adhesive (10 units, 88 caps base price), I sell for 22 caps, sometimes 19 if I’m really overstocked. 
---
Bulk Lead (20 units, 40 caps base price) I sell for 9 caps. 
---
Bulk Fertilizer (20 units, 48 caps base price), I sell for 9 caps (I’m ALWAYS overstocked on that crap). 
---
YMMV
---
And my hoarding stupidity can’t resist so please continue on, not everyone is caught up with obtaining massive amount of caps but for those who are you make their day every day, plus people who do this help me out a lot with reaching my script quota, you guys are my MVPS
---
Also, WS Golf course is so unrealistic after the apocalypse with NO golf balls in the sand traps AT ALL.  Rage quit.
---
I mean COME ON, Bethesda!
---
Especially when adding new systems!!
---
Typical Bethesda, get your shit together Todd! Instant loading or gtfo.
---
An unexpected ghoul, rushing from a corner of a room you never expected.
---
Pants-shitting scary.
---
I don't see why not, just do it it's not like you have a lot to lose
---
Is FO76 any good?  Never heard of her
---
I believe what you say. My Cha may have been under effect when I tested this. I was also working on a rebuild to share 3 points and found it strange that at 9 pts I still couldn’t share. I thought I had checked for negative effects nut guess I didn’t 
---
Because all characters start the game with 1 pt in each stat, I assumed that point just wasn’t applied to sharing
---
You guys I stopped playing a week ago because I had work, school, and a quick vacation to attend to. Has the game gotten better since then? Actually answer me in three days cause I still won’t be able to play until then and I need an up to the minute opinion on the matter. Many thanks.
---
Your unmodified Charisma (i.e., your raw number in your perk cards screen) is what matters. Any external modifiers, positive or negative, don’t affect this. 
---
I run 9 Charisma specifically to be able to share Inspirational 3 to my teammates.
---
u/ladydevann  There is one question that I have that wasn't answered in this post.  Will there be a patch next week?
---
It would, but the total bonus against scorched would be lower than Hardened + Zealot's. Numbers should be +62.5% (1.25\*1.3) for Hardened + Zealot's compared to +44% for Anti-Scorched + Zealot's (0.8\*1.8).
---
Its not hard to find a new server but if you're built in a popular spot then the server isn't the root of the issue
---
ikr? What a dummy.
---
We've got ticks BAD right now. Nothing "latched" yet on us, but any yard work at all results in finding at least one, on one or both of us.
---
I hate ticks.
---
I DO question, though... why Beth modeled the ticks as though they're already "full". They should be smaller, closed up... and only expand that blood sac when they've successfully attacked you.
---
My only critique is that it needs more eyes.
---
I'm currently playing the game, but looked down at my phone to read this post. Is the game worth looking up from my phone now? What's changed since then?
---
I... What?  I'm so confused by Sims being something people would write fanfiction for... Unless they're having the Sim come to realization that they're just a pawn for someone's amusement...
---
That's... I have no words. Lol.
---
There’s a black titanium resource point in Gorge Junkyard workshop, on the road between the house and the building with the chem crafting bench. Take the workshop and drop a resource extractor in it. After the initial defend quest, let that do its thing while you go hunt mole miners elsewhere.
---
plans/recipes I don't already have.
---
Mods for my gear that I don't have access to (or mods that require materials that I don't have - calibrated shocks, for example, require violet flux and I'm plum out).
---
sometimes clothes that catch my eye that I don't already have in my extensive collection.
---
Yeah, but remember... you can use that 1 pt in a stat as soon as you have a perk card to fill it.
---
Neither. It's the percentage of hp damage, or after the damage vs DR calc.
---
The equivalent pip-boy damage (without explosive) would be about +20%.
---
I confused the hell out of two of them just outside the Fissure Prime nuke zone.
---
I was standing near the drop site, in the middle of the parking lot area, between two of the low riot barriers. Not even good enough to provide cover.
---
But I guess the pathing couldn't figure out how to navigate to the narrow space between the two objects where I was.
---
Both of them kept circling, screeching, and eventually landed on each side of me, close enough I could have pet them.
---
Eventually one of them figured out pathing enough to sonic blast me. I was in only a hazmat suit, so it very quickly went downhill from there, lol.
---
The anxiety/fear/giddiness was fanastic though. Like I realized I'd been holding my breath and trying to to move, irl. Because I had a peice of chameleon armor and "If I don't move it can't see me". Except that armor was not equipped, cuz hazmat suit. And my irl actions did not affect the in-game monster, lol.
---
Cool, just let me know when is good for you
---
Those damned fairways are unforgiving. F this game!
---
Ohh good addition! I think this should be added to the game. Tag's in general should be added, maybe personalized even, I expect many penises but they could have tags you buy too. Kinda like Overwatch or Warframe, something to leave a mark for a little while.
---
Most people who are pricks online are trash as people in person. they have no life, no ability to make friends, and never faced a threat of getting punched in the face for the shit they say.
---
There is a skill at luck, don't know how it calls ins English, but it gives you, while you are under 20 or 30% hp the chance to ignore dmg. My favorite skill
---
PSN anthonybundy71
---
Haven't noticed any of these (Xboner, here)
---
That seems a bit cheap considering the effort required to make it. How much do robot vendors sell it for?
---
Since the ratio between stars and scrip varies, I'd suggest the following **minimums** for **trash** legendaries: 
---
* 60 caps for a 1 star armor (3 scrip)
---
* 180 caps for a 2 star armor (9 scrip)
---
* 480 caps for a 3 star armor (24 scrip)
---
* 100 caps for a 1 star weapon (5 scrip)
---
* 300 caps for a 2 star weapon (15 scrip)
---
* 800 caps for a 3 star weapon (40 scrip)
---
Max level legendaries with valuable affixes (TSE, BE, AAE, BSS, etc) will sell at substantially higher prices.
---
Yeah, it's not the reason I have never had one, but it's damn sure the reason that I will never have one.
---
0/10
---
Wouldn't it be more economical to either sell the excess adhesive or raw vegetables? Bulk fertilizer isn't all that valuable.
---
&gt; Yes but you putting then in the machine literally means it's no longer in the system
---
how does selling them in your vendor remove them from the system?
---
Butcher Pete is fucking fire.
---
Store what's under the turret if you can
---
I agree with the first half but wouldn't the pip-boy equivalent be more than the 29% increase, since what ever pip-boy increase would have to be reduced by DR and arrive at a 29% bump.
---
Maybe things have changed but I thought the numbers in the pip boy, not the card screen, show your true modified stats for that moment. 
---
I could swear that I’ve had my sharing ability broken by healing too much while using unyielding armor to keep my CHA high
---
10-20 caps per scrip is a better trash metric. 225 caps for a 3-star weapon would be a bit cheap, regardless of the weapons and stars, but 75c for trash 1-star armor may be a tough sell.
---
Anything that's actually useful and supply-limited is obviously worth a lot more.
---
You are charging by possible scrip return this way. Seems to make sense. It's a higher than what I have been doing.
---
Dude it's not even worth playing anymore, I haven't seen a legendary for 5 minutes. Todd hates us.
---
I've spent exactly 3 minutes in Survival.  Logged in, saw my character was on the leaderboard while I was still inside the vault at level 1 and figured something is very, very wrong with this mode and left.
---
Need Big Iron on the radio.
---
I mean this is all true but they're certainly not doing themselves any favors. Sounds like a miserable existence.
---
Stuff like this is always cool to read about. Really interested to see what the game looks like by its 1 year anniversary.
---
I agree entirely! Theres a lot of music out in the royalty free market that would still fit and be nice to have in game.
---
Personally I dont play with the radio on. I really like wondering the wastes with the sounds of the land and times where the original tracks slide in during combat is great! I also love running into the table radios almost giving the area more charater because it may be smashed but theres this little glimmer of hope as a semi jaunty tune plays. Its like the teaser trailer for FO3, love or hate the game, has this amazing feeling that a lot of games still cant hit.
---
Too bad after I run into the 40th radio playing "I Didn't Know The Gun Was Loaded" it starts to pull me away. We need more songs!
---
I use a Zealots Explosive Prime Gatling gun at full damage perks with stabilized.   It one-shots any minor nuke zone enemy. kills lvl 91 scorched deathclaws and mega sloths in about 6 shots.  honey beasts, mirelurks and wendigos in about 4 or 5.  The damage is immense and I'd rather go with the immediate 30% dmg than ramping up to the furious. This is mostly because the scorched like to run up and jump in front of the shots holding their pitchforks and fire axes.  Next on my list will be getting an executioners explosive prime gatling to switch to for lower half of the scorchbeast health meters; because the damage increase is better at that rate.
---
I don't get your meaning on "no longer in the system". I'm putting stuff that would have otherwise not been available to other players into the system by putting it for sale. I have enough good stuff for my build that I scrap as many trash 3 stars as I can, vend the rest of the trash heavy ones to the vendor bots for other people to buy for scrapping, and then put the decent ones in my vendor for cheap (but more than a bot would pay me).
---
I'm a solo player so I don't do any kind of big legendary farming or event farming, but I pull about 10-15 3 star a week on average, playing about 2-3 hours a night. I hit up a lot of the random event spawn locations and know mob spawn points and that's the easiest way I've found to find 3 star enemies. Walking to them seems to trigger them better than fast traveling directly to them, somehow. Like I fast travelled to the NAR repair yard earlier and nothing was there, but I walked to the tunnel entrance up the tracks and killed the mob of scorched there and came back and there was a 3 star sheepsquatch at NAR battling with some mole miners. Days when I just do events I don't get many 3 stars but days I just wander the map in the high level areas I pile them up.
---
Ouch. He doesn't sound like a smart man.
---
Honestly I'd prefer the pensises.
---
Hopefully they let our characters names actually be our display name too. There's quite a few QOL changes to make around this to really make it seamless the more we break it down.
---
Nice
---
If you spent the time to download it - then just get in and play man. There were bugs then and there are bugs now and there will be bugs many years from now.
---
What was wrong with it last night? It hasn't improved in the last ten minutes that I've been playing, as the floor textures are blindingly bright.
---
I would love some more songs to be added so im not hearing the same few repeating more often then others. I do enjoy the classical station more, personally.
---
The DR calc has a 1.365 exponent on damage, so for example +50% pip-boy damage results in +74% hp damage. It's why low-damage weapons are even worse than they look.
---
Right you are. I still mistakenly thought that there was some special rule when it came to sharing. 
---
Now that Im better informed, lm eager to get home and test this again

---
I don’t think buffs/debuffs affect sharing. I know I’ve had a debuff from Daddy-O and still been able to share a perk 3 card (I have 9 Charisma). 
---
I could be wrong. I think I’ll test &amp; verify next chance I get. I know that even when using Grape Mentats I cant share a perk 4 card.
---
I still have one I was given during faschnat
---
Free range is pretty easy as well and people almost always show up to that for legendaries.
---
Serendipity is a godsend.
---
Yes but over two weeks and not a word? The bug with the spoilers in other languages is huge.
---
Its pretty low. I typically don't tell people how to price stuff but since you are asking. At 75c per star I would buy every item you have in the shop and waddle home like a proud penguin. The good stuff I would keep or resell and the junk I would turn to scrip. A junk 3\* weapon for 225 caps is an extreme bargain of only 5 caps per scrip.
---
Remember that even at junk pricing the stars are worth more scrip as they rise. So in your example a 1\* weapon (5 scrip) is priced at 15 caps per scrip. However, a 3\* weapon (40 scrip) is priced at 5.6 caps per scrip.
---
My suggestion would be to make your junk legendary items valued based on scrip value since that is what people will buy them for. You could price it at X caps per scrip. Then, I would learn a little about what makes a good legendary and raise the prices quite a bit on those items. You could have 1 vending machine for scrip junk and one for usable items.
---
It might not be a bug
---
Lol, trolling exists because bitch boys like you.

The trick is that you will have to get lucky and discover me. If I reveal a platform and username, everyone will flock to the machine.
---
great answer.. I got educated to Robobrains!
---
Sell low and sell quick, sell high and make more caps but at a slower rate!
---
Yeah I would love to know aswell i just had to restart the game entirelly my old character is frozen outside the map so its just prone
---
Im on X-box
---
No worries! Hope my vague ramblings can help your adventures. If you’re on Xbox I might catch you in Appalachia.

Fun fact if you're looking to milk 10 brahmin:

As long as you have the materials it seems to be the most efficient way to do it. At least that's how I did it
---
This is a great idea!
---
Yeah Serendipity that's it. Best Bloodied skill ever!
---
Fuck this
---
There are tons. I just sneak in and take them all for scrap before anyone else can get there.
---
I'm just sending everything to the grinder for scripts now, don't have a vending machine and still keep hitting max caps through just playing the game.  I'm happy with the 25k caps limit but would love a stash increase to salve my hording instinct so I can keep more aid items and junk.

Appalachia has been nuked entirely.. the game's location is now Rodeo Drive and surrounding area.
---
You won't regret it.. Prime receiver replaces the speedy so you use less ammo but kill everything faster (less ammo) I'm 2 -3 shoting scorched level 69's
---
In case anyone wasn't reading the other thread, these effects stack additively for a 1.8 multiplier, but the -20% from the Scorched Killer receiver is applied to everything (not just non-scorched), so the total modifier is 0.8\*1.8 = 1.44x. By contrast, hardened receiver + Zealot's stacks multiplicatively for 1.25\*1.3 = 1.625x.
---
tl;dr: Never use a scorched killer receiver.
---
I get this error when I've just shut down the PS4 and not closed the app first. Then it'll pop 2-3x's in a row for me. Now it's trained me to just close the app when I log off and then shut down the PS4.
---
Platform is fine. Helps people to see if it's worth it or not
---
for me it was a 197 damage to a 235 but feels like more.
---
It's up there with the "lead pipes guy" post back at launch

Ooh that would be nice.  I sadly missed out on it when it was here.

My property value!
---
I like how this was deleted, lmfao
---
I love/hate the fact that someone stimmed you just to kill you again. That's some top-tier trolling.
---
Is there a recipie?

Moron
---
I've had some of these problems on PC, disconnects and invisible mobs killings me are the most annoying.
---
Well...............
---
If you hated it yesterday, you probably still will. Otherwise, welcome (back) to Appalachia.
---
Okay, that makes more sense. You’re turning the one Stimpack into 4 Diluted and getting 3 caps each, not selling the Stimpack directly for 12. 
---
And you can actually get up to 4 caps per Diluted Stimpack with a high enough effective Charisma. 
---
With Chemist &amp; Super Duper 3, you can average 4% more value than selling the standard Stimpacks and Purified Water alone. Plus the 14 XP base per, as well.

I hear that damn bucket song more than the others and it makes my eye twitch.
---
yeah, Ghouls moved in next door... the front yard is just rusting old cars and cardboard boxes now. Parties every night... there goes the neighbourhood.
---
Greedy publishers love mindless zombies like you. Shame!
---
Technically, I believe so. But I end up selling so much other loot to vendors that it’s run out of caps before I start looking to sell the veggies themselves. And I split my PW between Diluted Stimpacks and Vegetable Starch, so I don’t always have enough to max out both harvests.
---
Yeah, it's BS. I have 5 mags left to buy for camp display. If collector badge doesn't recognize bought mags by the time Creation Kit comes out, then it's on my list to fix.

Yes, it's stays there until someone kills you and yoinks it.

Doesn't the high capacity backpack knock off a bunch of radiation resistance. I know it effects armor and energy.
---
I’m Level 5 on Xbox, I just started a new character lmao
---
I’ll test at my next opportunity. I could be wrong. 
---
With my build, I can usually easily get to 25 Charisma when selling so it’s rarely an issue.
---
I thought I saw someone sneaking into the crawlspace.
---
I've noticed that the fly swarm over the meat pile now has, larger flies. So lame, I mean they're bigger than the bee's which is inexcusable so I'm done, game is trash!
---
For real and it works on fall damage too for my clumsy ass
---
You mean Concentrated Fire vs Demolition Expert? For what weapon?
---
The damage modifier for Concentrated Fire is 1% per perk card, but I'm not sure whether that's stacked per shot or what exactly it modifies. There's not much info on VATS in the data file.

&gt; Some of the PA horsemen paints look abysmal and I feel cringed when I see people wearing them

I don't think this should be anything in the atomic shop. Added to the game as an update that just adds pets sure.
---
👌🏼
---
I hope it's a non curable, super rare mutation. 
---
(Though I guess there'd have to be some kind of protection or cure, because if not..... "Turning people into ghouls if they don't want to be one is a backhanded insult to players by Bethesda"....
---
Would be on the front page of this sub in a heartbeat.
---
Did it today from start to finish and got no exp and no drops. Thanks Todd.
---
I’d pay power armor skin prices for it since I don’t use power armor lol
---
Store all your junk and find a Level 5 player and shoot them a few times (just intentionally miss), and they’ll fix it for you.
---
On PS4..... Not having any of these issues.
---
Yes you may be able to get one from a vendor still. It takes frog eggs, Brahmin milk, cooking oil and razor grain flour I think
---
If you are wearing your PA it is weightless.
---
Portable power is only worth getting if you carry multiple frames around, or are too foolish to get more than one frame and carry around pieces that aren't on a frame because you are not so smart.
---
Otherwise you are looking at in a reasonable case reducing the weight of a single frame, maybe two, which given they only weigh 10 in the first place isn't usually a particularly heavy burden compared to any other things you might be carrying around.
---
Super mutants STRONG. Super mutants SUPERIOR. Super mutants SMASH!
---
I think Bethesda needs to fix spawns I know they have been working on it but for a lvl 345 player to keep spawn killing a lvl 7 player is not cool
---
yes those are all my favorite setting, you hit it right on the head lol
---
I've never noticed a difference in stability between the 2 services. I'd chalk most of these issues up to people's connection...
---
I've got a bloody ultracite gatling laser, but I can use normal fusion cores in it. I can also make them ultracite cores. Is there a difference between using the different cores?
---
Pretty sure its 0.36 not 1.36
---
Its hard to write equations but:
---
Damage Taken = (Pip Boy damage) \* (min(0.99,((Pip Boy Damage/Damage Resistance)x0.15)\^0.36))
---
Basically the damage given is never more than the pip-boy listed damage \* 0.99 and is always reduced by some amount.
---
Hate saying it but keep playing, do events and honestly use the player shop to get caps.
---
Gang gang gang GANG GANG
---
The dirt bags who get excited about killing a player at such a huge lvl disparity need to get a life. Like, I don’t get excited killing lvl 1 scorched so why is it exciting to kill another player when it’s literally zero effort on your part? How is that fun...??
---
But I agree with others: Survival should be its own mode with an entirely different character.
---
Holy shit, you're right! It pulls off 60 RR. Time to delete my whiny assed post!
---
You know during part of that song she isn't saying bucket...yes part of it she is but go look up the lyrics
---
gonna have to try harder to get rid of that junk ammo
---
Sweet thank you. I’m making a food vendor and need stuff that doesn’t expire. Any recommendations btw?
---
I had to move my camp to fix that bug.
---
I get some lag, but that's about the only problem except for trash loot
---
Man, just my $0.02 but I am not a fan of the idea. Coming across a "tamed" monster like the Grafton or something in a CAMP would juts be... I dunno. "Silly"? Out of place? 
---
Tabbys, foxes, frogs, etc... sure. Hell, a chained up ghoul, even, ikf you wanna play a  particularly twisted character... but, that would be it.
---
think they already said seasons sounds like a good idea and every season all survival characters go to adventure and you must start new on survival
---
&gt; So I've posted a few times in this subreddit about the flatwoods monster having a thing for me.
---
&gt;he dropped nothing of interest.. kind of a disappointing end to what I feel like has been an interesting hunt over the last 20 or so hours.
---
That's where you went wrong, it wasn't the material.
---
I use it frequently
---
&gt; Last, but importantly, I think we made a serious dent in the list of player requests and top bugs. While we may not have tackled everyone’s particular pet peeve, we got a lot of quality of life fixes in and that’s something I’m eager to keep doing.
---
They did.
---
You're probably right. But im only able to speak from my own experience and i have had nothing but bad experience with ps. I grew up on ps1 and ps2 and i loved them... A lot.. But when ps3 came out i lost interest. Had way too many issues and restrictions (fallout 4 mods was a huge issue for me on ps4) so i just stay on xbox and i gave all my playstations away to the neighbor kids. But like i said. Thats just my personal experience with both systems and networks. I would reaet my routher and get a ping to see what its hitting at and maybe they are just not having a fast enough connection.
---
I'm down. Can't promise I'll be available for the entire time but I'll be around for a good chunk of the day. I also have a few cards I'd be willing to donate. I'll check out the discord.
---
Feed the people over and over for canned meat stew
---
Camp display?
---
Because the story line is setup to be people coming out of Vault 76.  Why would there be Super Mutants coming out of a Vault that would have been sealed?
---
I think royal jelly taffy does not expire, and razor grain four does not expire,  thanks all I can think of offhand
---
It’s buggy AF, since patch 9 every one I’ve done she’s flown away. Sometimes off map, yesterday she flew towards Whitesprings (ish) so I FT to head her off &amp; suddenly she’s back in the event area.
---
Want to buy all 2800 rounds for 1000 Caps?
---
Licensing songs is expensive, money I'd rather they spent on content. That said it'd be really cool if you could link your account to some streaming music service or your local mp3 collection and have it shuffle in your own stuff.
---
I swear she sounds like she is just clucking like a damn chicken that one point.
---
That hilarious. I'm the exact opposite. 
---
Xbox, Xbox 360(Still my favourite console and controller of next gens) then I switched to PS4. Love th PS4 , hate the controller.
---
Cheers mate, thanks for the info.
---
 I was just curious as I Camp fairly close to a fizzure site and killing the SB with all here buddies is my main source of Xp so I thought this compo would be really good for that area.
---
So would you recommend using the hardened receiver with the Zeolots instead??
---
As I have a handmade stalker for other areas.
---
Back online 
---
Oh i thought you said you was big into one of those desktop battle arena things?
---
Priming a Zealots handmade is more effective, I have my Zealots Explosive primed and ready to go
---
Supposedly we are getting camp clutter display for mags, bobbles, weapons. I heard it was delayed by the Purveyor.
---
I'm actually surprised they don't already have minipets available for sale in the shop.
---
One thing to do on survival. Cap all the workshops /defend. After rewards place down a stash box and stash everything you got and move on.
---
They should use your picture for the atom shop lmao
---
With your charisma you could save a few point if you switch perk cards if ur alone or with friends as lone wanderer is solo and the other is team
---
So? Just play the game. It'll sort itself out soon enough.
---
Not that I know of and I mod mine all the time. 
---
Maybe you can find one.
---
Of if they spent the time typing this out to do a quick search in the thread for answers/similar post
---
Exactly
---
This is why Fallout players should have never been given a multiplayer game. What a jerk.
---
Playstation controllers are just too small for me first off. I have gorilla hands and i honestly cant play ps systems anymore with their Trump sized controllers. I didn't have this problem when i was a kid. Fo gigure. Lol. I miss playing some twisted metal on ps though lol.
---
Hey u/FritoZanzibar,
---
We are aware of this issue and investigating what's going on. As soon as we have more info, we'll let you know!
---
Thanks for reporting.
---
I'll kill you for 10caps, my gift to you 😁 I'll even buy a single bullet off you for 10 caps so you don't lose caps.

Let's hope not. Just thought I read something like this happening now..

Annoy them basically.

I've never had a problem modding legendarys personally

Wood. Always wood. Nothing beats wood.

Good ol' baling wire and planks.
---
Not using it to kill anything but scorch, so a simple yes or no answer would of been great. Cheers
---
&gt;Specifically though, for straight up damage my TSE pump is wildly inaccurate unless I use a VATS crit. I understand that the TS effect causes this... 
---
TS increases a weapon's spread by 2.5x, both for hip-fire and ADS. I'm not entirely sure how this works with VATS, but my guess is that one projectile (out of 9, for a TS shotgun) follows the percentage roll and the rest are spread as though you were hip-firing. 
---
The +33% VATS legendary effect specifically increases the VATS hit chance and not the spread values, so it may not help much for shotguns.
---
Not sure if this has the answer but definitely has a lot of info.

Same here.

Original Xbox controllers were too big... PS controllers too small....
---
But that 360 controller .... Just right. I love that controller
---
I heavily modify all of my armor and weapons, I've never had a problem with it losing any stars or abilities
---
Only way to lose stars I currently know of is getting a 3* Assaultron Head or Wood Armor. You'll have 3*, log off, find it at 1* in believe.
---
They did take away the ability to add a star by modding in a scorched receiver or whatever too.
---
It's literally a garbage weapon. I just wish it were a good one. :/ So much potentially, so many issues.
---
More often, I'm a buyer at prices below those levels. I tend not to sell trash legendaries due to stash size limits.
---
Totally would but my stash is full already and I have plenty of lead
---
She is saying f*ckit during part of it so yea it may be a bit annoying but think about when that song was made and saying  that word.
---
Seems fair to me. I think I’ll try 25 per scrip to start and see how that goes.
---
34 days and nothing ouch
---
Would you trade for 1000 lead?
---
Have you done survival mode?
---
Drop into Survival. We will take care of that for you!
---
I need junk as well so if you have bulk I will trade that too.
---
This event was the best.   I still smile and have happy thoughts when any of my photos from it come up in my load screen.   Would have been better if i got a rare mask,  or more plans, but i enjoyed doing the event 30 or 40 times and will do it again as much as possible when/if it comes back
---
It's not at all weird that fixing one problem takes less time than fixing all the problems.
---
Where did you see this? People keep saying this, but the only thing I see are people asking this question.
---
Cool. Looking forward to it!
---
It's been fine on PC, bunches of people &amp; she hasn't glitched out for quite awhile.
---
The yes or no answer would be "yes", but it would be misleading. The better question is "Will I deal more damage if I use a scorched killer receiver on my Zealot's weapon?" to which the answer is "no".
---
Whats amazing is that they still keep the grass green and sand traps racked so nicely.
---
Lmaooooo you're the real MVP
---
I didn't start hitting d cent amounts of caps until level 70 tbh, but I was hesitant to farm stuff. 
---
I made most of my surplus crafting and selling ammo on the Fallout market sub. Good easy caps. Shotgun shells were 1 cap each before the nerf. Dunno now. 
---
Now I tend to make a burrows and Whitesprings run quickly and can generally pick up a few legendaries, and Max out selling to vendors just selling them generic weapons I pick up.  Both of them can be finished pretty quickly. 
---
Combined with selling drugs at my vendor stations, I tend to hover around 8-10k.
---
I do 30c and 50c for armor and weapons respectively. That bumps up to 90 and 150 for two star pieces. I tend to scrip three stars myself but if they are absolute crap that is heavy  I do those for 240 and 400 unless they are heavy, then they get a discount. I sell out everyday and stash space is more important than caps at this point. I also sell some good stuff as well but those prices vary widely, anywhere from 500-10000. Tend to price relatively high on things someone might actually want and them come down gradually if they take more than a day to sell.
---
Too bad we can't actually golf? Maybe mini golf? Lol

I’d just stay in PA for a heavy build.  That stabilized perk and armor ignore is better than anything Unyielding or bolstering has to offer heavy gunners.

---
did you even read my post? fgt i see what you did there and its pretty sad and petty, reddit stalker style...
---
i realize you are just replying to argue, but as im holding out hope you are not just trying to be obtuse on purpose...
---
Im talking about spawning in at our camp DUE TO players fast traveling to OUR CAMPS..... not the independent spawn mechanics for areas on the map.    The enemies spawning in are caused by fast traveling to our fixed location on the map so it sends a call to create the enemies at our CAMPS...  if someone fast travels to a  location that ISNT a player CAMP, things can be the same, I for one hold out hope that Bethesda's devs can simply adjust the calls for enemy spawns at OUR CAMPS,a nd leave the rest of the world locations as is.
---
enemies will still spawn in at your favorite spawning spots ans our CAMPS are on purpose segregated from off limit areas where Bethesda does not allow CAMPS to be placed, as those are the spawn points for enemies at those locations.  Our CAMPS are separate from those map locations.
---
BESIDES,t eh point you are ignoring is that I was in a spot that no matter how many times I myself fast traveled to my CAMP, it never spawned enemies, just non aggressive little woodland creatures.
---
but once player vending started, something changed, and now fast traveling DOES create new enemies.  so, obviously something changed.
---
happens a lot

You're a bad bad man.

Thanks for the suggestions! We do send surveys to random players that incorporate sentiment and offer places to provide suggestions. They are just not in-game.

While we don't have specific topic-specific threads, we are looking at feedback/suggestions/issue reports constantly on here, [our official forums](https://bethesda.net/community/category/232/fallout-76?language%5B%5D=en), and social. I know we don't see everything at every moment, but we sure try! We can also look to adding more things into future Inside the Vaults.

Thanks again!

That would be so fucking gross. They definitely need to do that.

I found a guy with vending machines and it seemed like a normal camp. I walked into his outhouse and the door shut and rad radiators gave me cancer. Guess he doesn’t want people stinking up his place?

Regarding new holiday events:

I'd like to see some ridiculous Christmas festivities. Maybe we have to jump along rooftops and drop grenades down chimneys into houses full of naughty ghouls. Maybe the shopping mall in the mire has a mall Santa, and it's a sentry bot with a Santa cap on.

Yeah I don't think I'd want any big creatures as we can already tame fairly large things but smaller pets I think would be okay. Mirelurk hatchlings... I really want little molerats because in my mind one of my characters has a pet molerat named Pumpkin (but everyone calls her stinky!) but the pet molerats don't last long because they're normally only like level 1 and die to anything.

I think I have a raider arm piece with the effect, but I want those specific leg pieces to complete the 'image' I'm going for as I don't wear arm pieces.

See that pip-boy damage occurs twice in that formula? You can rearrange it to a much more useful form:

damage taken = min(0.99\*pbdamage, 0.5 \* pbdamage\^1.365 / DR\^0.365)

Oh

I was in your boat for a while. Like most other people have said for caps, pick up EVERYTHING in an area and take it to a vendor to sell. And for legendaries, I tend to farm the feral ghouls at the Whitesprings as I usually get about 5 legendary items a pop. If they all suck, take them to the legendary vendor and try your luck with the purveyor. 
---
Doing this, it took me about a week to get all legendary weapons, armor and now I hover at about 5K caps (Because I spend a lot of caps at player vendors).
---
*Lock pick,
---
You can pick locks but you can't pick lock, when you pick locks it's called lock picking.
---
oh man scorchbeasts can wreck a place super fast!
---
yeah those are world enemies that can be pulled in from other areas (they were already spawned into the world and are usually in the proximity of your CAMP, so they might fly over or run past if they are set into a scripted action)
---
like at my house by whitesprings, there are groups of enemies that spawn near my camp by the train station, they always then run to the whitespring front gate to attack those robots.  They can easily be kited or you can draw the aggro if you are not careful.
---
But im talkinga bout the enemy instances that happen only due to the fact a player has fast traveled t your CAMP.
---
my whitesprings merchant is very popular place to be so you can just sit and watch as people appear in your camp, then immediately molemen are generated attacking the base.
---
I'm playing the game now and my ping is 35ms.  Is the game going to get better in 35 milliseconds?  Please let me know fast.
---
Brain bombs, Faschnacht Donuts, and Razorgrain flour is the only stuff that doesn't go bad that is craftable. Flour is for donuts so may as well make more donuts. There's also Sunshine oil but it doesn't give food or water. Perfect for a Slocum's Joe RP though
---
Early on you hear the advice to scrap weapons to learn mods for them. But after awhile you don’t learn much new and you’ll probably find weapons you aren’t going to use. Instead of scrapping them go to the vendor and sell them.  Same with armor. Set up a vendor and sell ammo like 5.56 and shotgun shells. Either from your stash or craft ammo using excess junk. Also, search everything because the handful of caps you find can really add up.

They added Npcs. I ran into a couple of them this morning but there aren't any dialog choices. You just have to shout things at them. But it is realistic, they ask you why you're shouting and then tell you to fuckoff. The weird thing is they were discussing a muller report, is that a new event or something?
---
Doesn't make sense how could a gun and receiver made to out lay more damage to scorch, be worse than a receiver that wasn't

"That's the Good Ol' Sunny South" as well as "Great Long Pistol" if anyone ever heard the latter in the BETA at all.

Meanwhile the rest of us run standard run of the mill no murder death trap shops. Which is fun but a little boring. You know the old "oh look another person who thinks 1☆ Zealots Combat rifles are worth 1K"
---
IMHO like shops like this because it keeps the game interesting. This was very clever interesting and TBH fun for me. If there were no random murder traps and surprises at camps it'd get boring. 
---
Some players focus on this person being a jerk or they should be reported. I like to focus on the fact I have something cool to talk about and a shopping experience I won't soon forget.

Degenerate gamblers, all of you

My wife bought it for me on PS4. If I didn't have 900 hours in I might actually just go buy it on Xbox.
---
That's people doing it because of your rank. They want the rank points probably. And doing pve in survival farms points. It's the only way to get it short of stealing it from another. (Which means someone had to farm it in pve)
---
*GoT milk?*

In pa the are huge doughballs fried in lard and sprinkled with sugar...come out fat Tuesday...hard as a rock by Wednesday. So yes.
---
I was wondering why all the shotgun shells I put up for sale fly out of my vendor.  That explains it.
---
I've not bothered confirming this, but Fallout 4 counted V.A.T.S shots as fully charged. It's likely the same with 76.
---
One of my characters sells booze and drugs in his "candy machine"... they sell... but not great. Every now and then, though... some degenerate comes by and buys a LOT of it at once.
---
I'll tell you what though, that ranger would never be anything like my Johnnie. The one they called Johnnie guitar.
---
You do!
---
Reminds me of a line from Naked Gun ;)
---
So we are both on the same page. But then how did your example of +50% pipboy damage yield + 75% hp damage if the damage coefficient never goes above 0.99. At most a +50% pipboy damage will yield +49.5% (99% of max).
---
Opened this thread hoping the suggestion was to combine paint and a plastic bag for a Nuka-shine like experience.

Radstag pulling a truck?

I could also see something for the solstice coming up...

all sorted now, but thank you so much for the offer

Many thanks for your help, I really appreciate it, that had been driving me nuts

You're probably right... now Ima boot on my spurs, and jingle-jangle-jingle on outta here.

I bought the survival outfit and absolutely love it, but the mask looks too silly for my taste. I rock the plaid hunting cap on top for full backwoods immersion
---
I jump over from PVE for the weekly challenge in survival.  I don’t really engage in PVP and the only thing I carry on me is salt.
---
I sell scrip scrap at 11 caps per scrip (freaking taxes). I have no shortage of scrip and the stash space is most appreciated.
---
I’ll upvote that comment. That’s like saying, hey you earned a paycheck two weeks ago. What do you mean that you want to be paid again?
---
Two more 3\* wooden armor peces today from the purveyor... ugh.
---
I remember that but what was the story again
---
I don't think there is a paintball gun In the game lol
---
Also considering that it's post apocalypse West Virginia, there's really not alot of "country/redneck" clothes in the game.
---
That, would definitely be the best thing ever! 😢
---
At least you make it to the event, I always have it come up and then before I can open the map, it’s done....
---
it "blocks" them from seeing you on map, sending you messages, etc... not from ending up in the same server.
---
Last night on Xbox it was Legendary as you describe
---
Please don't, because I'll be waiting with hopeful heart for you to knock upon the door, and you'll probably come back and never mean to stay!
---
It's hit and miss. I find it's buggy as hell if people try to draw her out of the nuke zone and keep her there. If I see nuke placement like that, I just avoid that area of the map entirely.
---
Ha, probably the syringer?
---
I think I'm going to make a little cheat sheet to hang off my monitor until I get your chart above memorized. 20c per scrip seems more than reasonable and a lot more than what I was asking for some things.
---
I eventually started making my own lyrics to Jonny Retar.... er... Guitar.
---
Glitches by the number too...

Dammit, making me feel things man...
---
Good speech. Thank you for writing it.
---
I wasn't trying to disrespect your comment in anyway was just implying a gun shoots a bullet and a bullet can kill you in one shot so I apologize if that seemed that way. I do agree with you about people just sitting at spawn points. I hardly fast travel because of that and I try and shoot only what I have to, for food etc players obviously but I guess that's how I enjoy the way I play. I'm not into the battle royal style but sometimes you have to just to survive
---
Go to Purveyor.   
---
Cash in my winnings and roll the dice.
---
Leave disappointed.   
---
Repeat.
---
Nope. Gone. It's not that I don't have the materials. I seem to run out of steel pretty fast but that's mostly because I craft a lot of ammo, but I have the materials.
---
Now that gives me heartaches by the number
---
I keep a full set in my machine. I buy them when I find them for around 10 caps and I sell them for 100.
---
And if a woodchuck could chuck wood, how much could a woodchuck chuck?
---
Well played
---
No worries at all!
---
My only issue is that I don’t run a bloodied build. And I’m not totally sure that I want too. I’ve got a second character that I’m working into a heavy weapons build that this weapon could work really well for. I know I’m missing out without the bloodied stuff tho.
---
And when he explodes he drops presents.
---
Ok, I'll go out on a limb here.  If your build.is fairly messed up, would you consider restarting a character?  Now that you know how how to play, have some farming tips, you might be able to zip up the levels?
---
This is cool. Can we get a Pic of the ring?
---
I once had an open mic night at my comedy club. Only a couple people showed up too but we had fun. I put on the grease jacket and pompadore wig and recided the Diceman's dirty nursery rhymes.
---
I've still got stuff stashed from before the purveyor went live and pick up a few other bits here and there. Don't get much time to play in the week so my reserve is slowly going down. I just buy 2* weapons at the moment.
---
Strip down naked and go wherever you see people. The lack of clothes will probably give them the hint.
---
Currently I’m renovating the ring to make it look better. Will send an image probably tomorrow
---
Not bad but sadly...I'm in barracks and I can't do much to the router. My current setup is pretty good for now.
---
Not according to the response they send you when you report someone. Specifically says you won't see them on the same server.
---
Other posts have said that it’s an item from the dev room.

In my experience,  if you hop to a server where whitsprings got recently nuked, you can clear about 40 glowing ones which drop %50 legendaries  😀
---
I use XO1 for nuke zones and excavator for everything else.  I don't even bother with the others.
---
Purveyor was a good idea, and much like a lot in fo76 qas executed terribly. I ignore it.
---
Well this explains it
---
Taken directly from one of many video based reports on a cheater.. this is part of the response..
---
"Once you have added them to your Blocked list, you should log out of the game and log back in. This will place you on a different server, and you should never have to encounter this player again."

naw im sorta cute myself 💋
---
IIRC some guy made a post complaining that the game glitched and swapped his character with a character that had a bunch of lead pipes in their inventory. A little while after that, another guy made a parody post complaining that his plumber RP was ruined because his lead pipes were all switched for a character with really good guns. It was one of those "had to be there" moments and it was perfect.
---
should have to have a new chr and I wish it was like hardcore was in diablo 2 when you die you die ...kinda like survival should be
---
Ah yes now I remember that really was funny
---
I think T-60 has the lowest repair costs, X-01 highest rad resistance, 51b higher DR, think Ultracite has the highest (but highest repair cost). Raider &amp; 45 get no luvin.
---
Could very well have bodged some of that. I carry x-01 for nuke zones &amp; jet pack, 60 for the repair costs &amp; it has the War Rider skin applied.
---
Blueprinting machines keeps their inventory? That's a great psa!
---
Ain't you a stinker?
---
I've only ever spotted a handful of them, maybe 5 at a time. Probably best off just crafting em really.
---
I was trying to put it in my stash the first time I got hit and couldn't make it back. Lost 200 stims, and 8 squirrel stew.
---
I mean I don't disagree,  but some of them are dressed differently. Most notably the Ski lodge ones are wearing tuques. And under my theory we're just hallucinating regular people as scorched, soo maybe our imagination is the issue.

I apologiise.

Thanks...I'll take a look at the other perks for FCs.
---
God this si good
---
Their inside the vault mentioned how much they liked tricking/surprising players. Could it all be a fake out? Only Todd can tell for sure.
---
???? I hope you don’t ask the same question to yourself when you roll out of bed, lol JK bro.
---
It’s a sandbox game. Go where you want, do what you want. The only limitation is yourself.  Best option is to follow main quest lines and explore along the way. 
---
Play around with weapons you might like and use points to build your characters towards said weapon set.
---
Yeah.. seen some 250+ guy hunt down my scoreboard cause questing in the middle of nowhere put me on the map. Bloodied explosive auto combat shotty. I never had a chance
---
I've been quite lucky and had some really good weapons from the purveyor. Made some decent caps and traded for my excellent current weapons
---
Thanks for the tip...I hadn't thought of selling the "bulk" units in order to get the price below a cap.
---
In my experience that happens after a nuke has dissipated and the sever has been running for several hours without being renuked. If your on a team you can kill the app and rejoin the team to resplendent then
---
If we give them all clothes then we'll never get to see those big sexy ones hurdle themselves through the air,... those majestic bastards.
---
Alright thanks, I guess I’m not use to such an open world game lol
---
The game music (and a few other things) remind me of borderlands 1.
---
Adding 50% damage rarely hits the 0.99 cap, although it can be an issue if you stack enough damage and/or armor penetration. For example, 100 damage vs 50 DR is 64 hp damage, while 150 damage vs 50 DR is 112 hp damage. Neither result is close to 0.99\*damage. To hit the cap, you need to exceed damage = 6.5\*DR.
---
I was speaking more about "blocking" and playing... the immediate effects, sorry. I misunderstood.
---
I have the x01 and it's the only one I use. I can over repair it and with the right perks I only need to repair it once or twice a week even if I'm in it all the time.
---
Its usually a bust..got a few decent rolls..i had  4 toons filled with legendaries..i have all of them maxed on scrip. I have the guns i want.  So the scrip is used to restock my vending machines..which i use to fund my travels to otger camps to buy guns and armor..which i use to stock my vending machine..which i use to fund my trip out to the purveyor .. Honestly dont know why im still playing this game..but i can not stop. Need caps. I NEED CAPS.
---
Try this instead, https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=86565bf&amp;d=sd0so0p02pc2ek1ce0c62a00a32as2l71lr0cd1l12eo2a72sp0s01su2a80ir2la2lv2lt2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=02386bcefig49571
---
Basically fixed the luck stuff - one point in Four Leaf Clover is enough for it to trigger every hit or two with a shotgun, and you don't care how much of the crit meter is consumed if you're refilling it completely anyway. That lets you add some damage from Bloody Mess and yet more from better criticals, which you should be firing every few shots. Charge crit with a torso shot, then headshot crit, repeat till surrounded by a red slurry.
---
majestic... naked fat bastards
---
Yeah Ik lol I didn’t have enough time though and figured the spikes were a better choice than millions of eyes
---
//snatches my wiffle bat - LEMME AT EM
---
Thanks for helping to make it better!
---
It's definitely a cool idea, like it a lot! It just sucks farming for legendaries and then getting a 3* nocturnal tire iron or something equally useless. Though it adds to the fun, it'd be boring if you got god tier weapons every time.
---
I love super mutated freaky looking creatures
---
damn i tought it was just a bug with my character.
---
I've never come across any plans for sheepsquatch weapons. I did a Sheepsquatch quest of some kind, but it ended with an activity that required more people, and I was alone. I'll trash them.
---
All good! Nah, I was just testing to see how messed up this feature is. It works just as good as most other features!
---
I just wanted to prove it was up to Todd Howard specs.
---
Because Bethesda don't know what they're doing half the time.
---
This game still has servers?
---
It is a crap shoot 
---
Did several WS runs last night and this morning.  On one run I got only one legendary drop.  On another, I must have gotten at least a dozen including a 3 star legendary pipe rifle.   It just depends.
---
Erm, if your a sniper, you can still take those in a couple shots.  I remember testing White Springs at lvl 28 and scope headshot lvl 60 something.
---
Thanks for the feedback so far. I feel like I’d like to focus on only one other set than the Excavator. Partly so I can focus on doing mods for only one set. So it seems like X-01 would be a good choice as my second set (maybe Ultracite when/if I get there).
---
My very large scrapped collection of 3 star tire irons, rolling pins, and useless stuff is a huge waste of time.
---
I’m level 62 and I only keep two PA frames. I was present for SBQ once. As a melee I opted to get a shot off on her and keep the mobs off the tanks. I’ve taken down a couple sheepsquach and SB solo. 
---
I liked mining arms and the HUD I added to the excavator. I’ve jumped between all the T models and don’t know that I care. Last night I spent all night and finally got the Nuka- cola paint for t51. 
---
So to be an ass I have excavator arms and helmet with -51 torso and -60 legs. All with mismatched paint jobs. 
---
So let’s see if this Frankenstein will work.
---
this just happened to me, over 900 hours in the game this is new for me. did Bethesda "fix" something else.
---
Just explore. I had the same issue in the beginning but just explore stick to the forest and youll get there.
---
I'm curious about this...if I'm level 60 and went through the final quests, isn't that endgame? Or is there something else I'm missing?
---
:)
---
Of course it does... I mean... after all this?
---
...something's gotta give.
---
I really enjoyed survival when it first came out. The killers were always shown on the map so you could avoid them and just play like normal. I found people to be friendly too because people didn’t want to show up on the map for killing another player but once they changed the scoring system I find it incredibly frustrating to do any questing. If you kill 20 or so enemies your location is on the map for someone to come steal your shit. Ever since they changed it I stopped playing survival mode even tho it was one of my favorite parts of the game.
---
a MAN 🥵🥵🥵
---
I've read that if you put the wrong mods on an ultracite laser, it becomes a regular laser. No idea if true, but the post seemed convincing.
---
I hear that i was just thinking what could fit into the world organically, what would make sense if we truly immersed ourselves and solved the problem as if we were in Appalachia for real. Advertisements would ABSOLUTELY be something people in that world would pursue. You already see it all over with holo tapes and signs and even some radio stations are already advertising something. 
---
I 100% think there would need to be balance. One ad per song is ridiculous but one ad every 30 minutes not so bad. I have a long commute to work so i listen to a lot of radio and its more like 10 to 15 minutes before more ads.
---
Maybe it could be something you could opt out of ads in the radio in the game settings or maybe a dedicated radio station just for ads. That way those like you who have a right to not want to hear ads can avoid them and those clearly vocal players that do want more information about players vending machines have that option.
---
It just seems to me this issue of not knowing enough to justify fast traveling to shops could have an in world solution that feels natural and not just a modal dialog of text slapped over the map. Radio ads to me just seemed like a logical first thought as its the only fully functional consistent communication medium in the wastelands, no tv, current newspapers, magazines etc just radio.
---
But, Bethesda why
---
Did you send us a cheap bag
---
Instead of canvas
---
Ultracite lasers and ultracite gatling lasers don't do any additional damage to scorched, as far as I can tell, but the +25% prime bonus vs scorched does stack with everything else.
---
I swear I've seen Responder scorched in starting areas.
---
I've got the Confetti and Hanging Streamers, 800 for each. IGN: Scoots\_McBoots.

What system?

I'll count myself lucky that haven't given you that middle-finger emote you've been asking about.   😉
---
yup I love it myself, totally wort the 900 points to me
---
Iv got a tse. Ps4
---
move to an easier part of the map.  I've been camped near the overseer camp for months only had a handful of things destroyed ever, mostly crops and mostly before the vending machines.  I think I have a better turret layout now or something as I haven't had anything destroyed in at least a couple weeks.
---
Protectron Elves would be great!
---
Yeah I'll take the other guys advice. 
---
Against scorch only it's the best combo.
---
But against anything else with the -20% damage reduction it would be sht.
---
Jaj the info you’ve provided here it hugely helpful to know! Just curious because I worked most of what I’ve learned so far out on my own, how were you able to learn this info?  Some kind of PC program or port that allows you to view item IDs? I know there are ways to do this but I am by no means knowledgable about them.
---
Not me!

---
They need to add this soon. my friend has contented himself by placing an absurd amount of frog jars around his camp. It's starting to get too noisy.
---
OK, so here's here's some more advice based on stealth rifleman.  Please note my advise is PvE oriented here, PvP has totally different considerations.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1c11596&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2ar2ao0an2a51lt2ic4&amp;w=at1lm2&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
The above represents the "core" of your build for the immediate future.  Work to  get those perks and ranks ASAP.  
---
I put ammosmith and superduper as slot in perks as you will NOT be using those 24/7, only when crafting.  No need to take extra SPECIAL for stuff you only use occasionally.  you can alss put those off until after you have the rest.
---
I'd also suggest that the next important perks to take after you have all the above are class freak and starched genes so that you can start acquiring mutations.  Marsupial is a game changer for stealth sniping as it allows you to find perches to snipe from in relative safety.  Shoot for at least 8 cha as that will give you room for bloody mess and the other 2 perks all maxed out.
---
As for weapons you want to craft yourself a max level .50 caliber hunting rifle with a silencer.  With the above perks, you will 1 or 2 shot most enemies assuming a headshot.  lvl 60+ super mutants might fall to 1 shot at night when you have 3.5x sneak attack multiplier.
---
A lot of enemies carry hunting rifles so learning the mods is easy and once you start to slow down learning new mods start looking at vendors and player shops for the .50 receiver plan.  The best is just the regular ".50 receiver" but the refined plan is also good.  There are a few other .50 receivers that are not as good as the rest so just focus on getting one of the 2 I mentioned.
---
The main benefits of hunting rifle for you is the damage will be optimal for the build and .50 is super cheap to craft.  With ammosmith you craft 180 per pop and every time superduper pops you get 360.  The hidden benefit is also that you can easily stock up on other ammo types by using the .50 to farm mooks with.
---
If you can find a simple 1 star instigating hunting rifle you are golden.  this will 1 shot most enemies in the game save event bosses so long as you are targeting weak spots.
---
A lot of people advocate only taking 3 ranks in weapon damage because taking all 9 is a huge investment for less return per perk than then first rank in each card.  There is merit to that argument but only after you have good weapons, up until you have good guns you need every last scrap of damage you can get.
---
I left a lot of room for other perks for you to use as you wish to flesh out your character.  If you find an explosive gun that fits your build 5 ranks in demolitions expert will max the damage and 3 ranks in fireproof + padded or dense chest armor mod will insure you don't damage yourself with the explosion effect.
---
Great thread. Soundtrack pretty good too.
---
Play xbox 😂😂

Dev room only stuff
---
I feel like I'm the grownups in Footloose... constantly running from one radio to the next to shut them off.
---
I think in game we're all united in our love for Fallout, and I think that's beautiful. So many communities bring about the toxicity in the fandom and it speaks volumes about them, but it's nice to know Fallout fans, despite being a series of chaos, pillaging, and warfare are some of the friendliest folk out there.
---
I think it would be a little longer than a week, so long as duping is kept under control. But yeah of course the hardcore would get ahead, thats what hardcore  players do. The point is it would level the playing field every season so others could have a chance to be competitive. Maybe a leader board every season so there is something to compete for other than the top spot during your play session. It would also have a totally different economy which would be interesting
---
YouTube your question if you want/need someone to guide you along. You’ll get the hang out if before long
---
Just don't mod it with that particular atomic shop item and you will be fine.
---
If you want to sell them bear in minds that this week's ItV hints at the Fatnacht event making a return and getting added to the pool of available events in The Forest.
---
If that turns out to be a reality the common masks are going to be worth sweet fuck all.
---
2 questions what other thread? And what about the 50 cal since it doesn’t have another type of receiver?
---
Had that once - they were all one\*s but it was worth the scrip to be certain.
---
No, im pretty new, and i just got mauled by a deathclaw
---
If it is the metal picnic table then just buy it because I have never come across it in the game other than vendors. - Level 250 Plan Wholesaler
---
I'm sure if you are having thisnproblem it would be quicker to just download it
---
First let me say building a base is very helpful. You’ll be able to fast travel to its location for free, you can make ample use of its storage space when you’re hoarding items, and it’s always a place you can heal up for free by sleeping. You’ll also gain an xp boost when you sleep for 2-3 minutes (real time).
---
Think of the map as a difficulty level in sections. Near Vault 76 is low level enemies with low level missions and events. I suggest hanging around there till you’re 1) feeling comfortable with your skills and your weapons. Or 2) You’re around level 18-24. You’ll have enough perks to keep you alive if you’re picking them properly. And you’ll be able to stand against stronger enemies.
---
Could never get it to work. Always had to do a clean install. :( Wish it was as easy as skyrim to reinstall like that.
---
Then 👉🏻 and 👌🏻 emotes too. Followed by 🍆 and 💦
---
But pc master race, full 3 star assassin's gear, tse gaus + vats cost reduced, ae+vats reduces Gatling gun, and tse laser rifle with beta+beam split+auto, and like 450hrs lol
---
Bloodied is always better but not everyone likes having a bloodied build. I personally do and exclusively use bloodied weapons and full unyielding, however, someone using a flamer as a main is probably going with some type of higher health medic/tank build
---
I have never listened to the Pipboy radio in any Beth FO game. I generally turn off all in game ambient music, and only hear the radio when I encounter one.
---
I find the "silent" world to be way more engaging. 
---
Plus, I think Beth kinda dropped the ball on the ambient music in their Fallout games. 1 &amp; 2 had that *fantastic* discordant, blaring, scene-setting background music... nothing in the last 4 games has come close to matching the *feel* of that.
---
Then dont block..merc them 😎
---
He didnt post any proof.
---
I have seen people shooting it, so it is in game.
---
The in-game BGM is hella dope. You won't be sitting in complete silence
---
No, but the one-shot thing is off-putting.
---
So I stumbled upon a bunch of devs?
---
What? Don't imply that distributing scrip items to mules is "something that dupers do" simply because you are too lazy to do it.  People that dupe probably aren't even bothering to get scrip in the first place.
---
I'd like to buy a vowel.
---
But in all seriousness, cheaters will always cheat. They r on xbox too. 😉
---
Right, in-game but unreleased. They exploited to get into the dev room. Not able to loot it in the game regularly
---
Dear hearts is still in...
---
Fair enough. Will update if I hear of any others.
---
I'm not trying to argue. Just a reasonable reply with my opinion. You didn't have to insult me.
---
Whenever a new player fast travels to your CAMP, a new set of enemies is spawned nearby. Noone noticed that before player vending came out mainly because there was no reason visit someone's CAMP.
---
The individual enemy spawns for each player are there for consistency which is essential in a game like Fallout 76. Every player needs to have the chance to interact with said enemies wether another player's CAMP is or isn't nearby. 
---
Best way of looking at it is: someone might not be trying to visit your CAMP but just happening to be around the general area of it. If the spawns are altered, that player might not get to interact with those enemies.
---
Well there is reddit, just post your gt and what event you are doing.
---
I do not want anymore “costs” added in-game. 😂😂
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdn7ap/to_the_guy_i_ate_during_the_encrypted_event/), it's not too long, but enjoy.

That's a lot of stash space per cap though.

Also wouldn't you lower price to clear out excess stock, not raise the price?
---
My homemade assaultRon helmets sell really well.
---
I like to see what kind of legendary items people are selling.
---
Very very little plans are rare
---
Both lists are great for FO76.  I've listened to most of your list and it's great, it's a great replacement for Appalachia Radio. It's both era- and regionally-appropriate. 
---
The spotify list is era appropriate. It's Fall Out Radio with some Appalachia flare. Neither are less than the other, they both have a place.
---
Next update- Snoop Doggs "Atomizer." Hooka attachment is 800 atoms.
---
I sell bloodied 1 stars for 1-4k depending on the base weapon model and level.
---
Nope - a bunch of cheaters.
---
Piggybacking this, if anyone on PS4 has the balloons I’ll pay ~1k for them
---
If site prime is closed, how does a new SBQ come out?
---
So I have been advertising events on reddit for over a month every week and what I can tell you is that it leaves quite a bit to be desired as a coordination platform.
---
We really need something in the game itself. Paying for a blinky hex of some kind seems reasonable. If it didn't cost something people would just do it all the time.
---
Ultracite is far more complicated to repair than t51. T51 has the highest DR for power armor but has less RR than Ultracite. Ultracite is in between xo-1 and t51 as it has slightly less DR than the t51 and slightly less RR than the xo-1. An what I mean by less is 10-20 less.
---
If you want full rad resistance then take the xo-1.
---
If you want full damage resistance then take the t51.
---
Excavator is the car.
---
Agreed. I was just using that as a max example. Thx for the discussion. I figured out where I was off. Completely agree with you.
---
Well I am good with folks not doing it. And if its really something u want..you can pm everyone on the server. Their names r listed in recent players.
---
The lake upstream from Site Alpha, where Dr Frank’s skeleton is lying. Regularly a crossbow lying on the ground and you can take the crossbow bolts out of the radstag and the yao guai (Though I find it hit and miss)
---
Well of course, only cause the launcher is somewhat inept. Pretty sure I've done this with steam &amp; blizzard launcher no issue.
---
Not a huge deal, just a waste of time if I weren't already stuck in bed I'd probably care more. May as well stop my backup from grabbing the files as well.
---
I put it down before they took it out.  Rebuilt my camp and was still able to put it down.
---
I have an armor piece with this effect 'glitched' that I have been using daily for three months and it has not fixed itself so unsure what the time frame would be from 'over time'.
---
Why couldnt it have been me?!
---
Yeah its kinda balls. Thanks for the input though! 3ish hours left : /
---
We don’t know. It’s kind of hard to watch inside the nuclear blast.
---
I am pretty sure you get a full set of Ultracite for free from one of the quests so keep an eye out for that.
---
I have around 100-150 you can have if you want them. 
---
ign ninjasrfake 
---
Won’t be be on until an hour or so from now.
---
"He looked into her eyes for the lat time.. "
---
"NOOOP! CHUN BA BAAAAAAA!" 
---
or something like that.
---
I miss fighting enemies in Power Armor.
---
Not possible on PC. We have no message method at all.
---
What are you on?
---
This is why we need damage markers when we hit things.
---
Cause really no matter what anyone says. Its all just guesses. Well educated guesses but still guesses. 😂
---
I hate fighting deathclaws and im far from new lol
---
I hoping for a 4th of July event, let is chill back with some beers, 25 year old hot dogs the park while mothman shows up with a keg and jet.
---
Have you tried putting lead lined on it?
---
pc
---
Geesh I am saying this a lot today.
---
Play xbox. 😬
---
But u do have me curious..what kind of events r u running?
---
You can spend them at the vending machines near the camp
---
Im a little sick of whitesprings ive ran through there so much lately. But i usually go there then cash in for as many 3* armor i can get. Had some decent drops. Got a ffr tesla once i sold for a bunch of caps
---
What armour do you have too trade??
---
Or how much are you wanting to spend??
---
Samen but i dont know when i will be on
---
I came here to say the shovel needs more mods! //I am serious .\_. i like my shovel
---
I used excavator pretty much all the time due to the carry weight boost. Even for scorchbeast queen fights. 
---
Now I have the calibrated shocks for the T60 that is what I use every time, for every occasion. 
---
It's cheap to repair and suits my needs. Rad resistance isn't too much a concern for me as I'm always in a team in nuke zones and rad sponge sorts that for us. But even if I wander in a nuke zone myself it's not too bad. 
---
Never really use my other sets, despite having the ultracite and x01 as well.
---
Would love to, but they can't die. Have had groups of 5-6 people dump on them and they take 0 damage. Everyone running top shelf pvp builds too. The cheats on PC are BAD lol
---
Thanks for the link...I remember that thread.  Never quite understood the Anti Armor part of it.  I guess it just comes down to, do you like your anti armor handmade?  Does it do what you want?
---
According to one guy's selection I browsed, Fluorescent Flux is 2500 a piece...
---
I have a ghoul slayer explosive shotty I’m willing to part with if you like that spec
---
I throw holotape game tournaments. But I have seen plenty of other player run events that deserve attention as well that all seem to be suffering from inability to get word to the server that something is cooking.
---
And negative on the Xbox! PC forever!
---
What happened??
---
One 3* a day and a bunch on the weekend
---
Upgrades for power, rof and recoil, along with scopes would be awesome for the crossbow. Some skins for it would be a bonus too lol.
---
I've had times where I'm walking towards a CAMP marker and all of a sudden I'm stuck in a wall that just sprouted up around me.
---
That depends...
---
Could a woodchuck chuck wood, and if a woodchuck could chuck wood, would a woodchuck chuck wood?
---
And if a wood chuck could chuck wood and if that woodchuck would chuck wood...
---
Isn't it easier just to ask them?
---
Definitely annoying.  One time, the vending machines were still within reach, so I was able to do some shopping before FTing away.
---
Well then u got to deal with plain old vanilla reddit and facebook.
---
PC drools, XBOX rules!! 😂😂
---
[](/cefilly)MG42, Flare Gun(also needs level scaling, Legendaries), Cultist Blade, Cultist Dagger, Single Action Revolver, Ripper(also needs a massive buff to be usable, and level scaling), guitar sword, war drum, death tambo, Drill(also needs level scaling, Legendaries)  
---
And honorable mention to the chainsaw who has awesome mod options, but can only spawn at a max of level 20 with no legendaries, and even does pathetic damage at that level.
---
full charge silenced at night with instigating and all the perks.  Feelsgoodman.

Hey everybody there's a new cat around

No worries! Thanks for checking!
---
A radstorm blew in and the radroaches took over. They're in league with the Purveyor and she turned everything to scrip. EVERYTHING MAN
---
Not much in the way of armour. I'm willing to spend 3K on it!
---
I spam the jump button as soon as I start loading in.  Helps from getting stuck as the foundations form around your. Pain in the ass, but it seems to work. Have a good night. Grumps
---
Oh man does the shovel not have any mods? I was really happy when I saw it on the purveyor's list.
---
Tell you what if you can get your hands on a lvl 45 TSE hand made I'll do a straight trade
---
Is it stuck to their character or can it be traded?
---
75c per star or lower?????? NONE of you have ever been my server that’s for sure! If anything I’m always on the 500-1000c per star server...lol
---
Send me gt if on Xbox, I got plenty of caps!
---
Ok cheaters, sure I get that, but like if I got their attention is it still possible to get one traded to me?
---
Fine. Exorbitantly priced tattoos. Like... 25,000 caps per tattoo.
---
Beth, get on it.

Here is my stealth sniper build.

Weapons are Anti-Armor Handmade for close quarters and Instigating Lever Action for long distance
---
Armor setup five pieces of 2\* Chameleon w/ +1 Strength Heavy Combat Armor. Each piece is BOS w/ deep pocket except for the chest which is dense modded. Backpack has high capacity.  I'm around 301 carry weight capable. All makes up for low strength perk so I can put it into other stuff that I can use more.

Mutations are Bird Bones, Carnivore, Eagle Eyes, Egg Head, Electrically Charged, Grounded, Healing Factor, Marsupial and Speed Demon

As far as I know it doesn't and I've been scrapping the hek out of them.

Yesss, especially when that wall traps me in toxic water trying to radiate me to death
---
Darn. I'm ps4 I would have said I have a tse pump you could buy or trade for
---
Aquaboy perk is good to have coming to my camp...lol seems to always spawn players in the water... 
---
Better than the player who built it on a cliff... I saw people spawning in, jumping out of the way and off the building...haha!
---
Can be traded but last time they purged dev room users they also deleted them from everyone's inventories. Dunno if you got banned for having it in inventory or only for the dev room. Buy at your own risk
---
Not sure if it's meant to but has for me.
---
Don't feel that you need a large camp.  Mine has been just 4 workbenches, bed, handpump, and stash since I started.  However, many find camp building more enjoyable than the game.
---
Also, don't be afraid to waste a character.  It took me about 7 levels before I had the basics.  Then i started over.
---
Basic idea is to do the main quest here and there, then explore. Just following the main quest will get you dead fairly quickly.
---
Also, this game can be enjoyed slowly, many place to explore, little vignettes that aren't on the map etc.  Found a couple of skinny dipping skeletons just the other day....
---
Just think to yourself, what do I want to do today? And see if it can be done.
---
Wasn't Dogmeat part of fallout 3?
---
It's in the top left of the map

Extreme body mods : Fallout 76 edition
---
Ya but i dont need the space. I sell junk often. Have a few goodish legendary weapons stored for later. Im the only player who has no trouble with stash space i guess lol
---
When did it close?? It’s always open... is there a new quest?
---
near the river?
---
If so... I always see folks in that area.
---
Make scrip purchasable with caps... and tradable
---
That's a real shame, hopefully it gets some love soon.
---
I would spend caps on some gold greels right now, fo sho. I'd then be able to take a screen shot with the caps being reduced and tweet it. My peeps be like "ooooooh". Or maybe some of the stuff I mentioned in my post. Idk.
---
I have a level 70, don’t play every day but have been playing since beta, and that crap still happens in adventure mode.  2 guys over level 150 took me out and I was on pacifist mode but it was one shot and I’m down.  I thought they’d move on so respawned at same location but there they were waiting for me and one shotted  me again.   I just gave up for the night.
---
Sadly I never played FO3 and only gave NV about a week of playtime. But I still absolutely love FO4.
---
I have also seen this said many times. My guess is this is a mistake made by the devs which can easily be explained by the fact that this stuff was imported from Fallout 4, which had Gatling Lasers which used the same fusion cores as the Power Armor suits did for ammo.  When they made 76 they made a new ammo type-power cores- for the regular Gatling lasers.   Power cores have the same icon as fusion cores in the pip boy and have a condition-meter that drops as power is consumed just like fusion cores. However fusion cores were apparently supposed to just be for Power Armor and power cores were supposed to just be ammo for gatling lasers in 76.
---
When they coded the ultracite Gatling lasers  into the game however, I bet they forgot to make the same switch from fusion cores to power cores. Which would explain why you can somehow use them even though you really shouldn’t be able to!
---
Thought id spare you the headache just do something else till its done. 
---
I finally cleaned my apartement. 😂
---
So... typical bethesda? Ok. Makes sense.
---
The list price is 100,so if the robots have it is probably 175ish.
---
helps when you started at fallout 1 and 2 (the REAL fallouts lols) and have a few hundred hours on each game....
---
On the plus side, 10 caps ain’t as valuable as it used to be.
---
Damn I wish my lessons did that back in the day 😂
---
Did you complete Rose's quests at a level below 45? (or perhaps even below 25?)
---
No, but when I played I would have loved this to happen, if I logged on now I would want that to happen.
---
Super mutants are sterile, no kids for the lovely couple I'm afraid
---
Just tried that. When I replace the vending machine, a single Requisition Holotape is still listed as for sale, but greyed out, says Its in another vending machine (I only have 1 machine).
---
They deleted them but I saw them used just yesterday. That does not make sense. Is the dev room something people walk into weekly or something?
---
its caused however from the damaged sections of the brain the ones that were cloned or volunteered didn't have the morality issue that the convict wiped versions did they even admitted it causes issues in the lore of the game which was why they were supposed to work along side people so that if someone saw a error they could manually correct it
---
If prices are good, no problem. When they want 1k for a serum...
---
The same problem twice today, after infinite loading screen
---
Idk if it’s a bug but cream isn’t soiling at all
---
[YOU VOODOO BITCH?](https://youtu.be/YA32ABtHu2Y)
---
No, near the farm. It's quite a wide open area. Barely any people.
---
But that aside, if you want to find another world it shouldnt kick you back into the same world you were just in. That defeats the idea of "leaving the server"
---
Me too! It’s my favorite thing in the game after my deathclaw gauntlet! I got super excited too because I’ve always been joking with my friends about the shovels being legendary and they were like “you wish!” And Todd was like!!! “Wish Granted”
---
Thought  asked but I'm on PS4:
---
Unyielding left leg 2* +strength 
---
Sentinel weightless increase ap refresh speed chest 3*
---
Weightless, redufood/drink weight w/+1 int right arm 3*
---
All max lvl
---
They need to fix the cap bug.. it's only 1/4 the players lvl.. and I wish ppl would drop more stuff than jus junk and aid tbh. It's kinda rare but I got quite a bit of good loot last week from pvp!!
---
Yeah but power armor is gross.
---
Yah at a low level of 16
---
I found 2 extra power armors with parts in my stash. I only had 2 one full and one kinda excavator bc i got bored with it but now i have 4 and dont know how to get rid of them
---
If you have to exploit to achieve a carry weight I can easily get with unyielding armor and a backpack, I don't think it's worth it, sorry.
---
Like I’m not complaining but it little weird
---
Sell?
---
How did they kill you in pacifist mode, on adventure mode, since the update?
---
I’m going to answer this with a Lonk!
---
[How can you resist a Blonde Hair Blue Eyed Wielding melee build? Just look at this stick!](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/fSwqbr9)
---
For some reason I've all ways got a dark nuka rum or whatever it's called in my fermenter when I log into the game. I don't even have the recipe for it yet.
---
I am not, lol. PC.
---
Dang it!!
---
Can i have one?
---
Without marsupial ya gotta go up, I wanna day, the western side of it unless you’re gonna move your camp, extend it as high as you can, and rinse/repeat if you’re going for the top. 
---
Otherwise if you’re already at the top, you gotta find a decent spot for the camp to sit so it spawns you, and others, at a better location. If you’re in the middle, between the two large rocks, hahahah, good luck. Took me a little over 2 hours for that setup.
---
I feel like my spot will get a little more dense now That’s I’ve said this though lol.
---
This has been talked about, killed, revived, talked about, killed, revived with the dragon balls, many a time. 
---
At this point just wait and see what the devs do about making something like it.
---
Interesting aproach, probably helps keep ur carry wieght down.
---
I run with the 51. Honestly repair costs are pretty low in that I only repair once a week maybe. Of course I'm out of it if it's not high level areas. Switch in the perk for cheaper repair. Definitely had to invest in calibrated shocks.
---
I just think it would be a pretty good idea you know. I hate having to put all the rad based perks on when I enter a nuke zone 😟
---
Well ,then gatlin plasma is the best and i bought the wrong gun. Nice
---
Shhh, no unpleasant truths! It's hard to maintain the comforting lie.
---
You fought well brother. You shall never be forgotten
---
Have 5 pieces of weapon weight reducing armour carrying weapons not a factor lol .. no just more fun handling in a few not just 1
---
That is the reward for completing that quest. Weightless until you take it out. ;) (Same thing happens when you complete Brotherhood questline, but with Ultracite Armor)
---
The fact that you can swap characters between the modes completely killed survival for me.
---
Gorram snallygasters! 😆
---
Me: Suggests an improvement to something completely unrelated to bloodied explosive 
---
Salty sea dogs: No that's terrible. I need my bloodied explosive handmade to one shot deathclaws across the map without aiming from across the map.
---
you could edge the blast to hit the prime site and be like 20 yards from prime.
---
20 yards is 18.29 meters
---
Yes, I'm pretty sure I got the plan from a scorchbeast.
---
I use X01 for nuke zones and T60 for general messing around.   It is dirt cheap to repair.
---
Theres a workbenches in the mine right in the entrance to the event area... why run all the way to the train station?
---
Fasnacht Day event
---
trying to get a rare mask
---
Quite impossible
---
I can get hundreds of plastic and steel from 1 west tek run from all the mutants weapons with the scrapper perk.  
---
Bonus tip: the amounts can go up the higher your intelligence.
---
Now lead on the other hand, never enough!
---
Really weird. Nervous about the ones I've got for sale now!
---
Opie the opossum
---
The syringer isn’t horrible. It’s just that people either use it on the wrong stuff or dislike changing weapons every so often. I used to use the resistance debuff when I’d get stuck fighting high resist monsters. Just like when the game came out and people trashed assassin sentinel pieces and other high value now items, people just didn’t know how to utilize it properly. Just look how recent it’s been since people found out how over powering executioner rifles are.
---
Hitting the gym???
---
An actual third arm out of the stomach. That’d give a boost to reloading
---
If it returns I think they should make new masks because let's be honest, the rare masks are basically common now😂
---
Do you know if i have to move my camp buy spending caps everytime or if you can move it inside the building area to change the fast travel point?
---
I already threw in my best way to make it. 
---
D.E.C.K
---
You get 3 decks each one can be used however you want. And get one at level 1-2, 30, 50
---
Basic default one are combat, crafting, and utility. 
---
But sadly it was downvoted into oblivion.
---
you'll do that till Ol Pete comes along.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Hx87sem.png](https://i.imgur.com/Hx87sem.png)
---
Xo1 has the best RR so good for nuke zones.  t51 gets called out for it's high DR but ultracite t60 is literally 1 point off. Excavator most people like just due to the extra carry weight but with the ability to get calibrated shock plans from vendors nowadays imo that's not as important as you can add +200 CW to any suit you want.  
---
One thing that goes unnoticed in the drive to get the best defense is ease of repairs: t60 is amazing in that it doesn't require anything special to fix it when it's busted. 2nd best rr in the game and middle of the road everything else makes it the honda civic of PA.  Reliable all purpose and economical.
---
It just works.
---
Moms that you have to clear for the workshops appearing inside and un enterable building or solid structure.
---
wait..., what?
---
There's a program called FO76Edit which gives you most of this stuff, although it's a pain to read. It's based on modding tools for previous Bethesda games that use a very similar file format. There's also Bethesda Archive Extractor, which can extract a lot of other useful data, like level-based monster hp and damage values.
---
It was an interesting idea in Fallout 4 but it was useless. Now the thing seems to just exist to pad out exotic weapons lists. A lot of the fun weapons are useless, like the harpoon gun and cannon.
---
I still want to know why there are 3 revolvers, 3 pipe guns, 3 shotguns and one pistol.
---
Yea same lol
---
But that's actually a good idea, how and why would anyone ever downvote that😂
---
Dude. Here's the secret:
---
At level 10 you can kill any level. Just get a high damage gun and sneak/vats.
---
Obviously rifle builds are optimal, but level is not a huge deal in PvP.
---
Once you’re at the top/ideal spot, you should be fine to move the camp itself to allow a different spawn without having to pay caps in the green zone. It might take a server hop though. I’ve generally tried placing it in the most unedited part of the ground or the highest part in my camp.
---
Also when I originally was climbing, it took me 2-3 camp cap costs to get to the top, but that was back in beta. Basically I build a foundation, then as many ladders as possible to get to the top, tried to climb a little, and replaced it.
---
Endangerol does work. I use it every Queen I go to and it does wonders. Not to mention how it works. 
---
Each player can stack the effect on a target. It doesn’t reduce them to nothing but it’s effective at what it does.
---
I tried to make a full legendsry trapper set based on rad resist. And all the pieces where bugged and never worked not even with lead lined.
---
I've put in a few bug reports but nothing ever happened.
---
Because I’m cursed and people just don’t like me for some reason.
---
You can't spell frustration without f-u-n.

---
That is a pro goldfarmer handling 4+ accounts simultaneously.

He is just makig cents...
---
Instead of 150 scrip per day it would be a 1050 scrip limit reseting weekly.
---
I guess we can look forward to the steam release, as that should allow backing up...but I'm guessing we're still tied/stuck to Bethesda Launcher. So unless they decide to add it, and I certainly hope they do, we're kinda screwed eh?
---
Elevators would be cool. Pass on basements. With the janky way people build I feel it would be a problem more than help.
---
I would give you one but I drink them as soon as I get thirsty.
---
I think basements are impossible, because there's nothing under the ground. I'd like at least to be able to build stairs that snap to the side of a piece instead of the middle. I usually put stairs against a wall out of the way.
---
BUCK BUCK BUCKET!!!
---
I'm always sell it.
---
Oh i see, Thanks for the info!
---
I’ve run into two in my game, shot them both times with the black powder rifle, and poof. Also, would like to hunt down this guy successfully..
---
Yeah, maybe even the thing of letting players use the nice side stairs without a number of glitches- on any floor that they wish. (Without having to glitch the game more using post method)
---
Well thank you
---
No theres no reason to. Its just more inconvenient for us then them I guess.
---
Meant copper and lead and can i buy some
---
I got a anti-armor Plasma gatling... So it does not work properly?
---
&gt;Endangerol does work.
---
Does it, though? I've not felt any difference whatsoever using it. Are we certain this isn't just a placebo effect where it *feels* like it's working but it's actually just people doing really good damage on their own?
---
Agreed 👍
---
Dogmeat was the best and only companion anyone ever needed.
---
He could carry 50 purified water, he didn't affect the Lone Wanderer perk, with his perk card maxed (can't recall the name) he could take down the biggest of enemies, he didn't get in the way too much at choke points as you could shot over him, he would find you loot....
---
I miss Dogmeat
---
Thank you for the fascinating background knowledge! I haven’t played other FO before so I had no idea. Another reason I can think of is the processing speed, realistic hairs are huge CPU and memory hogs and the dynamics are even harder to simulate in real time. The wendigo’s hair is pretty impressive but can’t imagine a crowd of it all moving at the same time. Almost a guaranteed crash. 
---
Speaking of the scorched it almost feel like they are still doing their daily routine even though their brains are supposed to be wiped. Super mutants are more hilarious. I often wonder what they say to each other during a lunch break. ‘Hey bro I know you’re a really legendary suicider, you’re gonna let me know when you’re about to pull that thing right?..... Riiight??’
---
Any luck? I still need to find the plans for the chest piece and both arms
---
The bird bones isn’t necessary. 2x Acrobats pieces make you immune to fall damage. At that point Bird bones just makes you float further when you jump.
---
He doesn't sell mods, at least not since the new faction vendors got added to Whitesprings. I server-hopped 5 times to make sure, and he never had a single mod.
---
Damn the poster now its stuck in my head.
---
You're complaining over in game enemies knocking over your virtual sand castle, and I' the 12 year old?
---
Have anything to add about the loss of a major cap sink, or are you going to ignore that point?
---
It can, or could, when another player attacked camps previously. The system seems to be in the place more or less.
---
I found a server the other day where every ghoul In ws was a bloated glowing one. I got my shit rocked.
---
Sometimes I feel like somebody’s watching me
---
I think the real test is seeing how other crit effects stack- critical receivers, eagle eye mutant, critical damage legendary effect. Those were the ones (legendary effect and better criticals specifically) I’d head mentioned before as not stacking.
---
Yeah either buff the wood (less likely) or keep the three star bosses from dropping them. It’s really an insult after a bunch of players use a lot of time and resources and get rewarded a drill or a piece of wood. There are fewer ans fewer people participating iss and sbq events, because really why bother.
---
Someone missed leg day
---
True dat 😆
---
My daily driver is a mixed set of X-01 torso and helmet with T60 arms and calibrated shocks legs. Best of both worlds.
---
Take the card off and see?
---
Im guessing it's supposed to be an explosive but that's not to say is incorrectly classified
---
deathclaws and X-bows are not a good mix, i don't think it's bolts you need try some bullets
---
No it works I’ve tested it with people before. And while we couldn’t place the %. With 5 people hitting her within the 2 minute window she was weak can be. I’d probably say at least 65% would fair in the effect stacked from us five. 
---
If I could get a new group of more people while we won’t get her to 0 resistance I’d wager we can get her low that even a group of under geared players could do something.  
---
But that would require a lot of planing.
---
Huh. Yeah, I guess you're right. Ain't that a kick in the head?
---
50 capped in adventure mode

Weight reduced weapons gain a ton of weight if you mod them. Otherwise, it’s fine.
---
It is affected by stabilized, therefore it does have some kind of heavy weapon tag on it.
---
I can barely give away stimpaks. Dunno how to sell stuff
---
Do you have the floor entirely covered in atom  store flooring ? If you do try replacing one of them with a normal stone foundation (non atom store) see if that makes you spawn there
---
I pray
---
I have my CAMP on top of Seneca Rocks. No need for turrets cool view just fast travel is a pain
---
I used to buy a ton of stims from player vendors but I got the recipe now.
---
One reason that it can be useful- little known trick, if you are IN power armor, and have other pieces in your inventory, you can swap them just like regular armor. I’ve done this with my emergency protocols torso and another torso that has a jetpack. Had them hotkeyed but one big drawback is whichever piece you are wearing when you exit your power armor... is now no longer in your inventory so it gets removed from the hotkey.
---
Tested this as well, you’re correct 😭
---
I never get them as a warning. Only when I’m in the act of defending or after the attack. It needs to be looked at.
---
It’s nothing like what you’ve been told. It’s an entirely separate legendary effect internally, that just so happens to be LABELED 25 RR. Internally it’s “antiseptic” and supposed to be disease resist. That part is broken too.
---
Most mules don't need to be leveled up above level 15, (for the 11 VIP weight perks).
---
Some mules don't even need to be leveled at all like the dupers mules for delivery or the mules for caps.
---
God grant you the serenity to accept that your deathclaw is gone
---
The courage to find another death claw 
---
And the wisdom to run like hell if you can’t tame him.
---
They enjoy it because low levels are the only ones they can manage to kill. Anyone near their level they will run or server hop to avoid getting rekt.
---
Go back to Anthem.
---
Rejoice, for you have been chosen to raid, friend! Fast travel to CAMPs and allow the divine monsters of justice to rain riotous Hell upon the CAMPs of those who are lesser. Let the flames of their base provide the enlightenment they truly need in this Wasteland.
---
Be the hero we all need and free the server of caps.
---
Zealots is the Legendary Effect, Scorched Killer is the Mod, if that's any help.
---
Don't know if they affect Scorchbeasts though, but they should.
---
That worked! Thank you so much!
---
Lol? Since when is logging into the game an exploit? It's a bug not an exploit. Also some characters have to use PA, they don't have the option for regular armor.
---
Works well in the Arktos fight. Tagged it before switching to damaging weapons. Haven’t failed the fight yet due to not taking down the boss, but have failed because the friendly either dies or runs up to the boss then dies.
---
Well, that’s why I put this post in the first place, thanks for helping out though!
---
Agreed. My corn is constantly destroyed while I'm away. Lol really annoying
---
Did I read that right or am I high on something
---
More damaged to scorched I'm not sure as I've heard people say both, but Prime receiver does do extra damage to scorchbeasts. I'm also not sure about scorched killers receiver, but Prime would be better anyway.
---
I tested it recently with the ShowHealth Redux mod (warning, that broke vendor purchases for me). It certainly didn't have any positive effects. If I'm reading the ESM correctly then it may actually buff the target's attacks.
---
There certainly wouldn't be any stacking. It's perk-based, not actor-value, so either the effect is applied or it isn't.
---
I dislike PA. But my point was carry weight of below 400 is very little compared to excavator easily going over 500. 
---
And with max strenght it's easily near 600. I can reach that with +20 food, +2 str food+4 str whiskey and buffatts.
---
This would be great. A notification would be awesome
---
"Oooooh, that little white girl gonn' get raped."
---
"Should we do something"
---
"Naw, she'd just start babblin' on about women's rights and mutan' 'scrimination and what not. Best to just let her figure out this one herself. "
---
"Yeah. "
---
You have experienced the blessing of the Whitespring Golfer Ghoul :3 Very satisfying finding a lot of legendaries on every enemy
---
My advice. Run all the way to higher level zones and then just get higher level friends. Score some hits on those higher level enemies and let your high rank friends murder them. Or just run to high level zones then head back to vault 76 so you can kill low levels. And pick up high rank items. Watoga is a spot for that, sell the power armor and weapons at the vertibird to the the traders. And keep a camp across the river at watoga it will save you the caps. Then just buy shit.
---
When you leave the server, do you click 'leave game' in the same menu where the options and photomode are? Don't. Instead go to your friends list, and move your cursor all the way up so you've highlighter your own name at the very top. Click, and then leave the server through here. You will never end up in the same server ever again.
---
(I've done this for 500+ server hops while farming legendaries, and I've never ended up in the same server)
---
Ammo, guns, and plans.
---
I want camo and a neon orange vest
---
Technically, no need. 
---
You can use 4 of your 5 characters for mules, but it will be a hell everytime you have to move something from main to a mule, as you Will need two steps, and someone to help you. 
---
MAIN &gt; FRIEND &gt; MULE
---
The optimal method for muling is to have 2 (or more) accounts, and to move yourself the stuff handling two devices simultaneously… or a strong PC, capable to multi/handle VMs.
---
It’s getting to the point where I’m getting stuck in the walls of my own camp when I FT there.
---
You can turn off the Main Menu music by creating the following in your Fallout76Custom.ini:
---
`[General]`
---
`bPlayMainMenuMusic=0`
---
"He"?
---
Are you Sicilian? ;)
---
Do a hard restart of your platform. It didn’t happen again either. 0.o
---
If you pay me I can be 😂
---
It's a glitch, not expoit. Latter requires you to do something special, to cause it. Excavator weight glitch is in effect when you login with it.
---
I am sure I hav added a bayonet more than once but have just tried to add it to one, no option came up but it is a 2 star (exterminator The dragon) may only work a std dragon will try and buy one and try it again
---
Yeah but that’s it. A large majority of the time I play on PS4/Switch.
---
I’ll add you on PS4. This looks fun! My name is brandnewzo there too
---
Yup, you're definitely learning how the legendary aspect of this game is played
---
Like the way the x01 works, so usually use that on all 3 of my PA characters. The 51 is generally better though, and have sets but like the x better and the repair costs for all are marginal at high level.
---
You should be the "one" that helps others get that Scout badge for reviving people in water. Shoot them all in the face. Raise a massive bounty. Do a lottery for everyone that you helped, winner gets to end ~~you~~ your bounty! :)
---
Sorry I'm all for annihilator sentry bots
---
For a auto piston prime? So far I’ve only found a song shot prime receiver.
---
Same. Endangerol works great. It’s not too notice when your the only one doing damage but it works.
---
The scorchbeast race template has the ActorTypeScorched and ActorTypeAnimal keywords, so Scorched Killer receivers, plus Zealot's and Hunter's legendary abilities should all work on them. Prime receivers explicitly work on scorchbeasts.
---
Points 3 and 4 kinda contradict themselves. Raising the cap limit because it's too easy to reach it yet can't afford the fast travel fees?
---
Might reduce the amount of posts on this sub, you'd be providing a public service!
---
&gt; bPlayMainMenuMusic=0
---
thanks
---
I think I killed him.....
---
It used to be split across shotgun and heavy weapon perks, but that was confusing to a lot of players and was changed to be a heavy explosive weapon
---
hehe… a goldfarmer at work!
---
Thanks scoots! Looks like you've got everything but the balloons and confetti. If you end up finding any, let me know!
---
Rng strikes again. Shrug it off and keep killing.
---
The dense mod on a chestpiece will negate damage from exploding cars just fine. Would be a waste to spend 3 points on Fireproof.
---
Bloody mess would be a nice addition to your build though, as well as considering a Bloodied build!
---
That's not the mafia, I was looking for. :)
---
No, he blocked the doorway so many fucking times when there was a deathclaw chasing me.
---
The newer weapons without any mods seem to be assets from an unreleased game that used a different system of weapons and upgrades from Fallout 4's gear
---
Selling for such low prices would be a waste of stash space in my opinion. It would need you tons of useless crap to get a good amount of caps and nobody buys crap. Hell nobody buys good stuff either!
---
I don't mean you should sell for 10k, but give value to what has it.
---
Sadly there's only one prime receiver for the Railway Rifle, and it's semi-auto.
---
I don’t want to set the world on fire
---
Think I sold all mine except the Owl for like 100 each. They were just taking up space.
---
It’s nut.
---
Ive been randomly getting purified water even though i rarely check my purifier and dont do enough events to have that many. 
---
Not that im complaining about the wendingo that puts them in mu backpack when im not looking.
---
That's how they reproduce ... infect hoomans and they turn into super mutants ... say goodbye to that y chromosome ladies ... i do know a doctor in Massachusetts who has had some success in a curen but come on you're never going to Massachusetts.
---
Yes, it does. Both from data-miners as well as in-game testing.
---
How's that working ot for ya, champ.
---
Craft some, go to flatwood's church staircase there is at least 2 aluminum bars, then get some plastic (traders or school locations), steel (scrap any gun) and adhesive (at watoga).
---
Thats be cool if you could build underground, own little bunker
---
super mutants have no pipi
---
I'll just buy 2\* or 1\* weapons, 3\* are wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to expensive.
---
I can kinda understand what the OP is trying to say, but at the same time that seems like what you would expect from a wasteland/survival game. Not to seem rude but this isn't Minecraft... You don't just build a house and have people visit, you have to defend it and survive.  That's why there is a whole section of ways to defend your camp. Sure a scorchbeast sucks when it's destroying your house, but it also sucks of you travel to a location trying to find one and can't because someone's camp is to close by. Honestly the best solution is to either move your camp or build better defenses lol, I'm always coming home to dead bodies and I rarely have to repair anything....
---
the usual garbage
---
It’s something we could consider testing.
---
Sorry to hear about Steve.
---
[I miss Helen.](https://imgur.com/x9SuaIJ) She loved her bed and balloon toys, although she always kept popping them.
---
It’s something we could look into some other time.
---
You should try that Counter Strike game i think it's free, the graphics remind me of the good old PS2 days, anyway Im settling down for the evening now, so you might want to take your eyes of my profile for probably a good 12 hours now, nite nite x
---
I loved the black powder scrolling glitch...just switch weapons and shoot over and over w/ no reloading animation.. twin two shot dragons was hellish.
---
"the revolution will be televised"
---
noooo
---
On PC you can get the ShowHealth Redux mod if you want to test for yourself. Alternatively you can swap perks in and out and try to match the bar size for a legendary vs non-legendary rifle.
---
Anti-armor effects are reasonably well-established though. VATS mechanics and explosive legendary effects, not so much.
---
I want this in my camp.
---
Seems it's just part of the game to me. Nobody would build a house in a wild environment and not expect there to be something wild occasionally happening, regardless if it happened before or not.
---
The first three letters of Assaultron are ASS for a reason, baby.
---
Elevators would be a nice alternative to staircases.
---
That was the real imposter Sheepsquatch  (ghoul wearing a Sheepsquatch costume and mask)
---
I'm pretty sure they've only announced special display cases/shelves for certain specific items, rather than placing any item we want anywhere.
---
Maybe everything you hear a character say isn't like but that characters individual perspective possible wrong, miseducated or a lie (maybe they have low self esteem and they just say things to seem smart) ... maybe it was a joke you weren't in on. Maybe it was the actual facts. Maybe just go with it, have fun, make up your own little version of events ... who cares really. I mean, if you're right or not. Your ideas might be very entertaining.
---
Mmmm, gotta get me some assaultron action. I hear the head(laser) game is killer!
---
Such lack of imagination.
---
Oh god.....
---
I went to remodel my camp and the same thing happened. I ended up storing the foundation it was on and that finally worked. 
---
As an interesting side note, one of my workbenches would sometimes show me the option to activate the statue, even though it didn't actually activate it. I'm thinking it was the bench that was "using" the statue somehow.
---
Wasn't a choice, but he sure wasn't born that way.
---
Feel like you'd find this in the mire as a high level enemy or some mutated cryptid like the sheepsquatch xD.
---
Yo. What platform are you on?
---
In your dreams, boy scout,
---
Get a SSD. High GPU usage is good. You want to see that.
---
Ps4
---
The automatic receiver for the railway has ungodly recoil.
---
Please report for re-education, member.
---
Make scrip purchasable for caps...and not tradable.
---
Do you know where to farm for lead?  If you hit a couple of spots like twice, you’ll end up with a ton of lead. I farmed it for a couple of hours when I first started, and I’ve never run out between what I initially farmed and just what I casually pick up here and there. I main heavy weapons, so I go through a ton of 5mm.
---
It's a shame really they couldn't  even if they tried no weiners available they could finger your hole lmbo
---
At first i thought you could turn a person into a bloatfly, or turn the screen green like when you get attacked by a scorpion, but no. Would be way more fun
---
I'm pretty new to Discord.  How do I join your channel?

In game I'm Shankwell.  My main character is a lvl 220 sniper, but my lvl 160-ish melee/PA alt is built for silos and tanking bosses.

Then we all fall down.

fo4 had settlement attack alerts, perhaps they can crib the methodology they used for that...
---
I get this stupid song stuck in my head. I walk around the grocery store whackin' and smackin' in my head. Craziness! Lol
---
Is that confirmed? I want it to bad to believe it’s not a thing lol.
---
I agree, but with vats it’s manageable
---
 He was tougher than the level 50 Scorchbeasts I dispatched just before I met him.
---
 I got Horns and parts called Sheepsquatch, but I am no expert on these things. Oh he was Legendary, I forget what dropped. :)
---
Me too even looked into detail to make sure it is.
---
&gt; Maria: There’s a holotape in Helvetia that mentions that since the robots are now in charge, they can ignore the calendar and hold the festivities whenever they please.
---
Error.  Please keep synced with real season.
---
Loading of areas seems pretty bad atm, you can run too fast &amp; it can't keep up.
---
Sometimes my house loads immediately, other times it's a full minute piece by piece. If I have my mule account hop to my main, he'll see the house instantly yet main has to wait for loading. Very odd.
---
It could be down to ISP &amp; user's LAN but I dunno, I'm pretty meticulous with my network &amp; have full faith in it. As OP pointed out no other game has similar issues. My ISP is great but I'm being cheap with a 18/2 Cable line...works fine for everything else.
---
Yeah, the automatic prime receiver doesn't exist in the data files.
---
just purchase a plan for the mod
---
If you have the software installed, there’s a plus icon under your known channels. Hit join a server, and enter the code I have in parenthesis.

They take a few more shots from my handmade than others for sure. They seem on par with Mirelurk Queens or there about.
---
Their health does regen? I had a house cat at about 60% health for at least few days once. I wonder whether that was added recently, or something about the cat was bugged.
---
Thanks!  Joined.
---
And this is why I don't have pets, despite loving the idea of having one. Its 100% bound to happen and its 100% depressing. Thanks Bethesda.
---
If your on xbox I can add it for you in about an hour
---
CAMP loading is intentionally server-limited, I think. Like they're trying to avoid sending too much data at once after you join a server. Started a few patches back.
---
Map loading while travelling is mostly disk-limited.
---
Mine is mgs_otacon
---
***Currently at Bethesda:*** HAY look at this Todd this guy wants elevators and we can't even do stairs right..... the room erupts in laughter.....
---
My suggestion is that you may have to learn the mod by scrapping it. Odd, I know, but after scrapping TONS of Black Powder rifles it has become apparent you cannot learn to craft the large bayonet this way. Another user said he learned how by scrapping the Large Bayonet mod. Try seeing if you can add it to a Black Powder rifle first (just see if you get the option), then maybe scrap the mod it'self to see if you learn to craft it. :)
---
 Yeah that's about right. I have stabbed a couple of them to death. ;)
---
 Stabby stabby FTW.
---
On eso you can out-run textures and foliage loading in with a fast mount but that's on the ps4. It's also another Bethesda game so possibly they just don't know how to optimize? But seriously probably just your mechanical drive. I put a 2tb drive in my ps4. I don't have anything to compare 76 with but I bet my pc with its SSD would put the ps4 to shame and it's an 8 year old system.
---
Can you confirm that strength increases this particular bash damage? If I decide to use power armor, I don't wanna lose damage because strength caps out at 10 or 11.
---
Bigger camp budget would be nice.
---
Based on your earlier thread I assume you're trying to close down all fissures on a single server?  What happens when the server shuts down for maintenance?  I've had it happen several times on servers that have been active for at least 4-5 hours.
---
Damn, that blows. I have a quad ffr that shreds, but I would love to play around with it primed.
---
...turn...off the radio? No, really, turn it off because Bethesdas world music is always amazing. More Inon Zur music please.
---
Some days I try and bake as much money as I can. Other days I aim to gain a few levels. Other days I just look for lead. Sometimes I chase events, or decide to claim and defend as many workshops as possible. Or pick an achievement and go for it.
---
*If you already participate in the draw please add ezequielfw to claim your 2k caps reward for the inconveniences. The renewed draw will be made the day*  ***6/9 at 12 pm UTC.***
---
It’s worth having, IMO. I’m only equipping it when I’m scrapping anyways and it’s just Int 1, so if you feel like you already have all your necessary perk cards owned and there’s no other QoL perk that looks good to you, might as well get it.
---
I what?
---
Does anyone else immediately put on the wedding ring when it drops or is that just me? (Sorry noticed you had it equipped in the pic)
---
Everybody needs a stabby stabby, they're not to be underestimated!
---
Exactly!
---
Good to know but does it give more than just extra wood and steel now?
---
It’s complicated. Most of the time it’s not maintenance, but the server crashing from stress. We’ve managed to have six fissures closed at a time by spacing them geographically. Our last attempt to time a single fissure failed because the server disconnected, for some reason or another.

Hi!!
---
Awesome! Well thanks for the info, it is much appreciated!
---
Yeah SSD is probably the easiest &amp; cheaper ways to get pretty good performance boost. Run an m.2 for my OS and a 980GB SanDisk for my games. Speedy AF.
---
So eight to ten hours.
---
I'm going to make a three little pigs camp. Hey Todd, can we get a straw building set?
---
I mean, I've been fairly vocal about wanting more info about vendors before going there, it's not like I don't want or need that info. I just don't like the idea of having to pay atoms or whatever and then having to listen to everyone's ads. 
---
I'd MUCH rather have the info on a scroll over of a CAMP. Even if it's just level info and legendary star quantity. 
---
To me using the map, or the PipBoy would be entirely natural for the game, and having ads on the radio, would be super annoying. I mean, youtube is currently cutting videos into like 3 minute segments and starting to play 2+ ads in front of videos. You want in your Fallout? I would hate it. 
---
Although you mentioning tv made me think of all the newspapers laying around (yes random I know). Maybe we could have a dlc or whatever that opened a newspaper, and people could pay for ads in the newspaper. That would actually be kinda neat, and if you didn't want the newspaper you wouldn't have to read it. You could have a little blurb about your products and change it at the newspaper building. Then when you log onto a server, you could check the newspaper or something. Maybe it could be in your pipboy, so it could keep track of the people on the server.
---
it was super cool getting this mod plan tbh.  I thought I had everything from just farming it and then you get a plan that you had no idea existed Haha.  I am making them for people if youd want one!
---
Im on, username sammy33
---
It's really good for farming steel (from ballistic weapons) and plastic (from energy weapons). Doesn't do much for anything else, but if you're crafting a lot of ammo then it's useful.
---
You can get mods for the backpacks like extra capacity and refrigeration with Possum badges and some new outfits and camp items with tadpole ones.
---
Worth noting in case you don't know that you can immediately craft a higher level version of the backpack which gets extra carry capacity without needing any badge spend.
---
See that seems odd though, why would it take longer for the owner than for a visitor? It's only limiting half way I guess?
---
As mentioned my install is on SSD still can happen.
---
I am in the same boat when I play solo. When I play in a team the caps and legendaries seem to flow. I think it helps that as a team you can work together to all tag legendaries and then just mow everything down and move onto the next area. Solo you're more likely to take your time and possibly explore. I've only ever depleted the legendary scrapper once sbd it was only through running round in a team where I'm mostly playing solo
---
Right??
---
Hi!
---
Just the weight of the weapon is reduced
---
Random things that hover in the air. Gotten some great pics from this one.
---
Perk cards help out a ton. Iron clad, barbarian (especially if using unyileding armor), lone wanderer, serendipity, etc. There is on in agility but can't remember off hand. These are my fav to use.
---
So no screws or anything like that?
---
It's just the weapon pretty sure
---
It's pretty much only good for steel and plastic, but it's REALLY good for steel, and fairly good for plastic.
---
I see. Ty for reply.
---
Happy to lend a hand while I can.  I doubt I can play all day, but I can do at least 4-5 hours.
---
Dear Bethesda -- someone is playing your game, please make them stop.
---
My guess is that it's not prioritising your own camp, so it's actually downloading up to 24 camps at the same time for the player who just joined the server, but only one for everyone who was already present.
---
Kicked in the head? Stop lying, after all..."its a sin to tell a lie"
---
I would love to say the breathing underwater perk, still keep wanting to try it out in pvp one day...
---
For armor i like any stealth oriented like chameleon and harder to detect. Also ap refresh is nice.
---
I’ll think about getting it then for plastic
---
Bobbleheads are for the atom task to use 76 of them so I don't care which ones they are.
---
Thanks turner 
---
Haha tonight i finally got to grips wirh swapping the cards to suit 
---
After hours of playing just tonight i feel like such a dope 😀😀
---
No screws, no. You can get small quantities of slightly-useful materials like rubber or cork, but I don't think scrapper helps much there.
---
I'm pretty sure you don't lose the bonus that easily. It takes several seconds of not hitting or hitting another target to reset it.
---
Well that’s a rip

There's one other Bear Arm mod plan. You can't get those until you've learnt the Bear Arm plan.

Lol good job
---
Fallout 3 had wonderfully depressing ambient music. I honestly think it has the best ambient of all the new engine games.
---
I find all of bethesdas game music to be good. Sure the TES ones are better but i like the somber tone.
---
I'm kind of in awe you drew that much detail from memory. I can barely remember what the body shape or head looks like unless I'm staring at it.
---
I love that one when I’m running around in power armor.
---
Man you know those sliding catwalks in the Thunder Mountain? Can we get those too.
---
Used to be an nvidia fan, but ever since folding turned out to be a scam, amd cards were found faster for crunching by around 4-5x, switched. Anyone who's familiar with pyrit and other crunchers know what a scam huang was pushing back then. It's better today, but that really left a bad taste. The way they charged devs to optimize their shitty hardware with physx was monopoly bs too.
---
I'm running a older amd gpu with 8g gddr and quad channel 32g ram, it's fine. Intel always been good, I know someone who went with the newer ryzen and he was complaining about premiere not running right. I showed him editing 4k h.265 100mbps in real time and he knew he facked up. The maps take a while to load everything in from the start, but if you stay in, it sorts itself out. May have something to do with your network too. Far as frames dropping, I don't see that.
---
Makes sense to me
---
Ok thanks!
---
But you're in the free states tho...
---
Or the button bridges in the Glassed Caverns that extend and allow for a sort of drawbridge vibe. That over a massive drop, or perhaps something more sinister. I can already see myself getting ghouls onto one and letting them skydive.
---
It’s actually your weight in real life, so you’ll be able to jump with practically moon gravity
---
“Your settlement could use your help. Well mark it on your map”
---
Imo. They should treat the Cryolator, flamer, laser and plasma guns ammo like cores. One core per “mag”. 
---
It’s but hey I have to craft 30+ cells or cartridges and “use” each one as per shot. Just count one cell as it is “A Battery” 
---
If I mathed right is like 13.3 fusion cells to match the power of a fusion core. 
---
A flamer canister should hold a fair amount of fuel to fire the flamer. Why I should have to craft that many “shots” is just odd. 
---
I guess for game balance. But it’s not like changing the energy class would be that big of a deal.
---
A nice one is combat armor with the bos mod on it.
---
 Also i would suggest getting dense mod put on whatever chest piece you are wearing. This will protect you from explosions and scorchbeast attacks.
---
Zax has broken free.

It's fine we know its' weakness.

and its not like that would have been the only vending machine in your game
---
and if it was you could just server hop lmao
---
[why?]
---
I only brought this outfit due to coming back to Xbox after playing a load of games on Switch and forgetting that B and A are in different positions on each controller. There goes 900 atoms I'd saved up...
---
they were trying to tell us something :)
---
Yeah you're right. I mean all these other critters mutated, evolved, and started hunting something else. I really don't recall snakes in any Fallout. It would be cool to see what kind of snake their artists could muster up.
---
I don't think ur camp gets attack while u r nt there , unlike fallout4 there r no npc's at ur camp there for random enemies do need to attack it
---
I’d like to see a three headed hydra I mean Brahmin and stags have two heads so why not a hydra right?
---
..into parts unknown ;)
---
Wot
---
For the black powder rifle? I have one I can sell to you if you're on Xbox
---
I actually had the confetti set aside for you on my main character so nobody would buy it out of the machine. I've got it for you whenever you want it, and since you paid the vendor price for the streamers, I'll do 600 for the confetti.
---
I actually don’t know. My character has 15 strength but I’ve never really considered if it increases damage. I’m inclined to think it doesn’t given how bash damage is treated as its own damage type. But I’m not sure
---
Cat eye would be a better name imo
---
All I can imagine is the basalisk from Harry Potter with 3 heads now.
---
Stop fiddling. Smash!
---
\-Strong, 2287
---
We are now best friends. Exactly what I saw as well.
---
The last one I fought got stuck between some rocks and didn’t even fight back
---
At least your finding some legendaries... I’m having some crap luck the last 2 nights. I’ll take crap just to get my scrips for the day
---
Plus he wont be born for another 100+ years from the time this photo was taken. (Not sure on Dr Virgil's age in FO4 so, goin with the safer bet...)
---
Yep, never looked back on the in-game radio once I realized I could just play spotify in the background.
---
Sometimes I do miss listening to Country Roads while I'm exploring though...
---
packs of mobs
---
Looks like my prom picture
---
Server disconnects
---
with the prize so near my grasp.
---
Think I'll read a book.
---
Vault-tec sealed away.
---
That we may rebuild one day.
---
Will we submit? Nay.
---
encourages you to play with others?
---
are you serious? Im going to leave my response at just those 3 words for the sake of decency.
---
also if you dont use a microphone, its literally impossible without a 3rd party mod, and im not going to install that either.
---
yes i HAVE a microphone, but i dont want to plug it in.
---
 This one fought, but I fight from Stealth and circle strafe em', and he only got a couple of shots in.
---
Is that a super mutant npc?
---
Yeah, you're right, 175 years plus. Looks like she's gonna be a he. If she survives the gangbang.
---
I have no idea, I just figured they had found someway to cheat
---
I think so, but I would have to check and do some comparison scrapping (with it on/off). 
---
It’s kind of like Chemist for me; if I’m going to crafting chems, I just automatically equip it.
---
Its a limited time sale if the original price is slashed and lower, way to tell. Limited time items are always full price
---
Yeah for every jerk in game there are several kind and genuinely good players.
---
yeah that's true
---
Yeah. Fallout lore is fascinating. One thing I do know about 76, is that they are using an older game engine, so you’re right that the hair could cause a crash since server instability was a concern very early on. Though things have improved, there’s a fine line between a smooth gaming experience and lagging and crashing. It’s like playing on a knife’s edge. 
---
You should definitely check out the other Fallout games. They’re a lot of fun and give you the ability to dig really deep into the happenings that saw America fall and the construction of the horrible creatures that now inhabit the wastes. Fallout 3 is my fave but Fallout 4 also offers a really unique experience with a lot of references to Fallout 3. New Vegas is cool if you don’t care about Brotherhood of Steel and like Westerns and gambling (I like westerns and gambling).
---
They definitely cannot. 
---
I suffer 90% less connection issues than you? I've got 1gb Fibre Op..... And you're stealing wifi from your neighbour along with everyone in your student housing unit? 
---
Don't tell me it's not an issue on your end ....it probably is.
---
It's very good for 5mins did anybody from your class know it?
---
Night eyes already exists in game as a perk in perception, it just isnt very good atm and needs a little bit of love from Beth.
---
Collection of hostiles
---
I keep a weapon on me that I almost never use but I did put a night vision scope on it and that really helps.
---
The brotherhood of steal would like to know your location
---
what standards of his exactly are you trying to belittle? the bad game design and absence of multiplayer tools to facilitate this type of quote-group questing experience-quote? or maybe the lack of communications tools?  or maybe the lack of community tools?   I dont know, seems like the bar to pass any of these standards isnt even high enough to stub someones toe.
---
Bloatfly barrel is nice. You can get legendary glowing bloatflies shooting glowing creatures. Endangerol is a must have, always. The bleed and radscorp, better off with a instigating rolling pin (imo). Maybe someone found a good use for those. The bloatfly barrel does some damage too if using it for quests.
---
That would only make us targets for the crooks.
---
Only if they call them danger noodles
---
I might've skipped Mayor For A Day too if I hadn't learned you can just hide in the elevator till the timer finishes 😂
---
We should call them Raddlesnakes.
---
You can get the bear arm weapon as a drop as well - not just the plan
---
Once you go green...
---
My Steve Jr. ran away\* when I moved, as well. But I found her again a few days ago, so keep faith, your Willy will pop up again...wait that came out wrong. 
---
\*story told to myself when someone assuredly killed Steve Jr. Now I have another DC and instead of naming them I'm just pretending they're all the same DC...
---
XBox. Sorry man.
---
Two man enter, one man leave.  🤠
---
What does Formula P do? It's the only thing I havnt gotten yet...
---
The breathing under water w/ chameleon 🤔🤔🤔
---
I feel like it might make the servers run very bad
---
Numerous Nasties!
---
Gaggle of ghouls
---
you have map markers. Go follow them. 
---
you have quests. Go do them.
---
You have the ability to make a badass camp, whether it be on a golf course, on a cliff side or in a nuke zone. Go build one.
---
You got plans to make neat shit. Go build them.
---
its Fallout. It's just literally Fall out. Go whack things until they die. Enemies too hard? Turn around and find a new path. Or run right by them. Or shoot them til they die. That always works.
---
dude, for five minutes thats pretty damned impressive
---
There's a perk that does this?
---
I mean...the Ghoulish perk card is also used as the Pip-Boy icon when you have a crap ton of rads, so tbh I don't get why it isn't a thing yet.
---
That'd be rad.
---
ASSUME THE POSITION!
---
Yeah, because in all of the games where you can remember your password people get their accounts stolen. Give up on the nonsense, you’re just as mediocre as them.
---
Np  Bud I live in Seneca rocks so I know the difficulties of spawn placement
