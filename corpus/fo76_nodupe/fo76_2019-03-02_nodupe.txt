I don’t care either. Let’s get back to more important stuff. Have a nice weekend!
---
---
---
Good! Glad I could help!
---
I totally agree with this, this past event with the Mothman spawn rate was quite fun but I feel as though they don't bring anything exciting to the table other than junk. With the Mothman spawn rate increase I did see a lot more Flatwoods Monster not sure if that was intended or not but I enjoyed it. They were both like 30 meters away it was odd.
---
Damn, that's a nice looking bed. I mean the linen looks clean and laundered. It's nice to see something  new looking every now and again. 
---
I believe that high level mobs take priority when spawning in. I was questing around Top Of The World, at the ski lodge right next to it, and just after I cleared out a small group of 3 level 22 scorched, I went outside and was immediately greeted by a group of 4 level 68 scorched, because someone high level went to sell stuff at the train station just down the hill.
---
No worries man..no harm no foul 
---
Mononga was nuked once in a map I was in and it had good enemies mainly mole miners and tonnes of nuked flora, a lot of cobalt and crimson if I recall. 
---
 I gave a level 9 a level 10 Black Powder pistol yesterday. If you have your mic on I can make you almost anything. Otherwise I'll just try to help ;)
---
That's happened to me before.. Pro-tip, wait a few minutes, the meat pile will spawn back in the general area. I would have been angry if I lost that 1* Wood leg!
---
No kidding nice pull. Put that on an alt for sure.
---
 Worth at least 3 caps at your friendly neighborhood bot vendor.
---
I reserved 100 pounds for just that. 
---
Fix energy weapons 
---
Reactive plates are a strange way around. Melee hits guy, armor slaps back, wearer becomes wanted.
---
Not as quick to sell but not necessarily saving. Get enough coming in to not worry too much. I'm curious what the legendary scrapping does. 
---
Serrated combat knife.
---

---
Using it, I know I am ready for the next area, when I can kill everything in an area with my serrated combat knife, without using ammo.
---
The end game us when you can kill the QSB with a serrated combat knife.
---
Yes
---
The whole first year roadmap should have been content the game released with. It's just inexcusable how little real content there is.
---
They come along now and again, the highest I've seen was a level 42 2 star got a ts broadsider for it.
---
thanks dude ! really appreciate it 
---
Ever used a pistol in PA? Embarrassing. 
---
Saving anything that is not a 1 star 
---
And what was the loot?  Hopefully worth a ton of Ultracite ammo
---
Most of the time the mob will return to its spawn location. From what I’ve seen. Don’t give up. 
---
Grab your excavator armor and head to Lucky Hole Mine. You'll have more lead ore than you'll know what to do with.
---
Problem is, griefers enter build mode anywhere on the workshop and start to contest but then immediately stop. You'll get a single message that scrolls by in the notification are in the upper left and then vanishes in a couple seconds. If you are at all distracted or busy, you'll miss it. The griefer will then find and kill you.
---
Or worse, the griefer is on a team, one finds you first and gets in position, the other starts and quits contesting, and then you get killed before the contest notification even shows up.
---
It is just not worth owning a workshop, ever. Leave team, capture, get reward, rejoin server, rejoin team.
---
Yeah, am just wondering how much is enough at this point and how great the scrapping system will be.  I'm wondering if it's like gambling where each star scrapped gets you a spin on a roulette wheel or what. 
---
Awesome
---
I expect to be on a bit this weekend but may also get on the new division 2 beta for a while too 
---
See ya online soon!
---
yoo u fuckin better be able to 
---
The negative coverage was mostly but not all, misinformation from people who were trying to get clicks on YouTube and/or the people who got all their info from the people trying to get clicks on YouTube.
---
Don’t want to burst your bubble but in my case, it’s you, your junk and the caps I get from killing you, that I’m after. So I don’t care if the workshop is empty, has denfense or working collectors.
---
Ok man chill. I believe you. The video was funny 
---
IF, and this is a big if, they make it so scrapping will grant a legendary mod then those will be worth it. If it's a spinning wheel I'm probably not going to bother. Kinda sucks they teased it but dont give any info at all as to what it actually is. 
---
That sucks man keep in mind rad x will also suppress it, take off all of your perks and test as well. I hope this gets fixed!
---
Seems like it's clear locations like this should be buffed 
---
I would think their effective in pvp against stealth and melee builds, aoe weapons target the opponent even when invisible and offer effective resistance against melee builds by creating a buffer of dps at no AP cost. 
---
It does that for others as well.  
---
Enjoying pvp and slaughtering some lowbie are pretty different. If the person you are killing is under level 50 and you are not lets be honest, you aren't after some competitive pvp experience, you are just preying on the weak. Not that there's anything wrong with that I guess, it's part of the game, but lets not pretend it's your unabated love for pvp that's motivating you. That said to actually grief someone would require chain killing pacifists, taking their entire base to the studs (unless its behind whitesprings or other similar turret offences) or just general unprovoked harassment. IMHO
---
You mean, [like this](https://i.imgur.com/NsCsiIz.png)?
---
This was in early January. It was some sort of visual glitch. I entered the power armor with the gauntlet equipped. The game unequipped the gauntlet. I was bare-knuckle in the power armor, but the gauntlet continued to display until I equipped another weapon.
---
If your just trolling griefers, I have a MUCH better method.
---
Make a new alt.  Store all junk, earn not more than 25 caps.  Claim a workshop.  When any griefer shows up to contest/build DESTROY everything they build, don't worry about bounties.  They will easily kill you, but they can't stop you.  Ensure that Nothing can be done in the workshop.
---
They will earn nothing from killing you, will waste ammo or weapon durability.  All the while you can even bare knuckle DESTROY all equipment until the workshop has no resources and it simply uses the griefers junk for them to build/repair.
---
Even with the poverty rebuff you can quickly destroy the items built in the workshop.  You inflict your will upon them, they have ZERO recourse. ;)
---
Right! Thanks!
---
Thank you very much. My only other real need is to get rid of rads, but I only entered Morgantown yesterday and found some RA. Then someone called in a nuke and I had to rush out and get clear. You wouldn't happen to know how long the blast zones last, do you?
---
Thank you all so much for your help!!! The weapon was found using suggestions offered by you guys:)
---
That sounds even better. Might try it. 
---
Someone I met today surely had the same idea. He got none of that and less.
---
Saving some 3 star armour I was going to sell. I don’t think it’s worth it keeping one star stuff....
---
I’d really like to be able to curtsy, as a man in a combat helmet and bathrobe it just seems appropriate 
---
The mutation seems to keep you hidden in PvE much better than the chameleon armor set.  Further having BOTH means if your armor breaks completely you still have the mutation to fall back in in case of emergency.
---
&gt; How as a high level do you get higher level npcs to spawn?
---
Just by being somewhere. Enemies spawn because of you and their level is determined by your level. Has nothing to do with causing them to spawn at any level. Certain low level areas just spawn low level mobs to stop noobs from getting shit on constantly if high level players are in the area. The rest of the map is based on your level.
---
Literally laughed out loud at this. The dude abides
---
Enjoy your Bloodied level action!! I have one and it's my primary weapon :)
---
Again for the anthem example, there isn't any new content coming until May on their roadmap. The division 2, which I'm assuming they were trying to beat to market, is coming before then. It is very likely that people will jump ship to TD2 and stay because it has content to keep them around, the division also transformed during it development based on player feedback and that is all being brought to TD2. Even from the beta tests the division 2 is an objectivly better game than release Anthem, its just a different genre setting-wise.
---
Yep, sometimes it’s lucrative, sometimes not. 
---
A 3\* Mr. Handy Buzz Blade, no Stable fluxes and plans I already knew. Also the nuke zone was barren so I could only make 1 stable violet flux. No problem, I stopped making ultracite ammo as it is waste of time.
---
let me guess u camp located over whitespring near a lead mine. that is a random spawn point.
---
I'm wondering if they will have some sort of limit on how many items we can do per day 
---
Dumping all 2-3 stars on my mule
---
My level of jealousy is hard to express.
---
That gun sounds AMAZE
---
Like the order of mysteries?
---
Actually also sucks for newer players too... when you are around there for questing at level 30, and some lvl 150+ is farming there... then you just keep dieing to those high level monsters that guy triggered... no fun at all.
---
Soup fills both hunger and thirst meters, soup is your friend. Do the main quest/overseer missions up till the airport at least, lots of good rewards and they teach you some things you need to know. There’s a soft level cap at 50, you stop earning special points when you level up after that, you get the choice of a new card or to move a special point around after that. Scrap weapons and armor for chances to earn mod plans. When you craft weapons and armor you can choose it’s level. You can fast travel from inside buildings now. Some perks allow you to “over repair” weapons and armor, over repaired weapons do more damage, armor gives more protection
---
My camp is right in the end of the disposal truck on the map just south of that and I see mothman fairly often as well
---
The title like you are asking somebody to start sex with you.
---
Yeah. I stopped too. The cost exceeds the value in my opinion. 
---
What time zone are you in? I’ll try to come down tonight. I’m central America.
---
Am tinking along those lines as well.
---
Sorry, I don't speak "angry parrot".
---
lol
---
I’ve yet to see Flatwoods at all, and the Mothman always runs away when at half health for me. 
---
You need to be more specific when you say "odd", as that doesn't give any real information. The Display settings are very easy to tailor to your Computers capabilities.
---
I appreciate the info. I haven't touched the game in a long time. 
---
Haha.
---
What we need is a metropolis biome.
---
I'd like to know what happens if you close every fissure and then summon the SBQ, that'd be a super lengthy but fun experience. 
---
Stacking explosive bobbleheads is the likely answer, which i believe they've changed. 
---
I had Rank 2 for days and it never procced once. Rank 1 and Rank 3  procced normally. This was over several sessions (logging in/out) and on PC.
---
AFAIK it has not and still does not work.
---
You can power up a Workshop with the Workshops stock inventory. So it's not exactly hindering anyone. I usually roll in to Sunshine Meadow and plant a Fusion Gen and complete he 'Defend' Quest then leave. If someone contests it, it's no loss for me. Plenty of other Workshops to take
---
STELLAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!
---
I couldn’t resist 
---
Lol that makes more sense. We got it launched. What did you think about running it with a group?
---
How could you close all of the sites? Because, nukes only have limited area, and can only have three nukes out at once, right? I could be thinking about this wrong. But I dunno. 
---
I caught my first glimpse of it 2 days ago. Made a shot from distance and it teleported its self to....hell knows.
---
Elusive little blighter isn't he?
---
Lvl 77 and been needing 1 more for days now😂
---
To be fair, there is also a pretty big difference in the studios reputations as far as addressing bugs goes. Every single single player  Bethesda title has bugs regardless of how long they have been out that simply have not been fixed and those bugs are typically fixed by the modding community. Something that has been prevented by fallout 76 being online MP. Bioware has a pretty good track record/reputation for fixing bugs, listening to community feedback and admitting when they drop the ball. 
---
Bethesda is starting to get better at this, but as you said, for a lot of fans it "tainted" the fallout series.
---
Just posted a thread on the main page :) 
---
It might take two hits to kill you instead of one but you'll need stealth boys to avoid crits no matter what armor you use. Players are squishy though so with a bloodied unyielding build you don't need to be at 20% life and running that low in PvP is a mistake. Around half life will be enough to one shot pretty much anyone still and help survivability.
---
Great snapshots! Thanks for sharing! 
---
Nuking Wavy Willard’s Waterpark is a waste of time. Nothing of note
---
Or perhaps I'd been primarily playing Red Dead 2 since that released and so hadn't felt like buying another game for a while? Needlessly snarky response. 
---
I think if they lowered the space that lights and turrets take up it would really help a lot of people. Those seem to be the biggest cost for my build
---
Hey! Just curious what you mean by “task lighting”. 
---
Over at The Powerhouse, with such a huge amount of built area, I found it was really easy to light the whole thing fairly well by using the Work Lights. They put off a HUGE amount of light. I’m lucky that my shop looks the way it does though, with the steel mesh floors in the second area it looks great lit by (mostly) just those two lights. 
---
I found one a few weeks ago killed it, it dropped shit loot 
---
For sure. At least on the rare events when I find 3 star legendaries. I haven’t been saving anything below that due to the space issues. 
---
Yesterday I found a mutant explosive dragon. About 6 shots and it broke from full. 
---
I think there's a 2 or 3 hour cooldown after launching a nuke while the silo builds the next warhead, and there's a 30 minute window between launches so people don't drop all nukes at once. I have not tried this, but in theory you could have a large group of players working together staying in the same world to launch 10 nukes over the course of 10 hours (unless my math is wrong, that should work out). It would take a huge amount of effort, but I think the servers are stable enough now that an attempt could actually succeed.
---
I forgot all about it! Man, I need to see that, some giant sloths and Mothman
---
Yeah he kept teleporting around me,  then after 4 or 5 times he began to attack back. He has a really awesome lazer beam attack. Similar to the Assaultron but unique 
---
Id like it more with more skins. I rocked it for a while but with my jetpack Calibrated shocks and blackbird atomic shop skin for the X01 ive been rocking that one more
---
Yea it is confirmed, Andrew Badera has been skipping and missing out on the interiors
---
I mean you have to pay to move your camp sadly but it probably costs less then what it costs for the greifers in ammo or in stimpacks food, water
---
Well, if you’ll notice, I specifically said “any *future* claims...”. I’m not about to try and make claims about what used to happen, I can’t test that. This also wasn’t an examination of all the ways to end up *in* PvP with someone, which would automatically disable slap damage. This was just an examination, in the current game, if slap damage could be “overcome” when players were not in PvP mode. The retaliatory damage test was sort of a check of that, true. It didn’t really fit the intent of the rest of the test suite, it was just something that came up in my previous post. 
---
We're out there living life and rebuilding America! I prefer the 'Random Encounter' element. If you run in to me out in the wastes, you best hope you brought Deep Pocketed armor cause I'll be raining down gear on you. I haven't got the patience to wait around outside the Vault. I usually track down the nearest lowbie when I want to unload all of my excess Plans/Recipes, Ammo, Aid, Junk and low Level Legendary items. Just wish they wouldn't run away from me so frequently...
---
Is he right about robots?
---
Wendigos always drop screws, and super mutants often carry screws.
---
I don’t disbelieve you, it’s entirely possible they’ve been tweaking slap damage as patches have come, and not talking about it. I perhaps should have put a disclaimer at the start that these results are only applicable in this current patch. 
---
Someone is always Watching...

You should also move the location of Grant's Saber for lower level people following the Mystery quest line. 
---
[This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d3563fb&amp;d=s40sm0sn0se2ss2sg2a72a80aj2a40am2ar0ao0a00a30c71l12l71lt2ek1i42ck0sf0la2cu0eo2p52&amp;w=c12iq2ev0au2cm2if2ir2lm2pe2&amp;n=Melee%20Vats%20Ninja)  is what I run with an unyielding set (+1 chameleon piece). Stealth melee is very do-able with ~24 AGI. Gun-Fu and Adrenaline work with melee too. I’m happy with it. One each of the weapon damage perks gives you +30%, the next 30% costs 6 more perks. I would rather have blocker and full incisor. 
---
We will have to run it again at some point if you want and hopefully won't have as many issues. The server was buggy for me at times but luckily nothing was invisible.
---
Haha I'm already subbed in filthy casuals and I'm in the discord!  Thanks! :)  I will check that help menu out.
---
I only have the rusted knuckles mod for mine, after the new update coming my shotgun melee character will be regulated to building a bar, that armor is what ill be wearing when I start selling cocktails. 
---
They don't have a way to turn off the Vaseline effect while you play.  You can turn off depth of field for pictures but not when you're playing... which I find annoying.  I thought the game was broken when I first played it (well, more broken).  
---
If you're looking for a way to undo that I believe you can check the 76 Nexus for mods that clean that up.  Then maybe you'll have better luck tuning it while not giving yourself a migraine. 
---
Haha I’m not chasing down all the little glitches, just checking for ways around slap damage. But that’s a good point to see if low/high level differences somehow affect slap damage. I’ll consider it for future testing. 
---
Rumor around the wasteland is that you can use a flamers to bypass slap because supposedly burn damage bypasses slap.
---
Lightning claws are never wrong. Just like thunder hammers.
---
How about a map that is as wide and time-consuming to cross as that of Eve:Online, with resource-rich areas where PvP is free-for-all and mission-rich PvE areas heavily policed. 
---
Maybe there are more places and we just haven't found them.
---
Well, as others point out, it’s entirely possible that the mechanics functioned differently in the past, Bethesda patches them, and didn’t include that in the patch notes. These results should only be viewed as applicable for this patch. 
---
Would of been so awesome if it dropped Alien Blaster (possibly legendary) and Alien armor/clothing.
---
Thanks, I will learn how to put all pics in one link one day
---
Hell if I know, I haven't sold anything to anyone yet. Probably a couple hundred caps?
---
It's just the special version of the black powder pistol similar to how the dragon is the special version of the black powder rifle. 
---
Rank 2 has never proced for me
---
How about they *fix* 76 before they add in min-games?
---
It's not that rare depending on where u look.  Find them more often then lever action rifles honestly lol.
---
Yeah but if they’re actually griefers then I doubt they’d want the resources anyways, isn’t that the definition of griefing. If they were killing you for the resources then it’s not griefing just desperation. So I don’t think your example necessarily fits. 
---
Also if they’re griefers then they won’t care that they’re not getting caps just find enjoyment in ruining your play session.
---
Yeah I actually had my first pvp experience with a high level player killing me and taking over my workshop... First time for everything! Lol
---
There’s no window between launches. Literally one second after I launched my first nuke for Prime, somebody else also launched theirs there. 
---
Ya know i tried this. But. Its just lame. All rise is cool sure. But wont lie. Watoga before lvl 50 is dangerous when lvl 100s spawn the 68+ legendaries and assultrons are just murderers... 
---
My 2nd play through is pure melee and ive been using the mom gear since 25. That and the excavator power armor allow you to do whatever wherever whenever mostly. 
---
And once you start doing rhe brotherhood/enclave stuff you get legendaries either with luck or trades on the r/76trades.
---
Telling someone to not do quests on his first playthrough tho.. savage brah
---
Because despite the name they are nothing alike. One is old world technology, the other is new world jerry rigging.
---
This is actually pretty funny, I overheard some co-workers the other day talking about a game, talking about these still some major bugs, that they released some kind of road map for expansion, etc.  I stepped in and was like, "Whoa you guys are playing FO76 too?"  They gave me blank stares and told me they were talking Anthem.  It was awkward.
---
Yikes, ugly math. Good to hear. At some point I want to do a much more in-depth examination of attack damage, with sneaks, criticals, critical modifiers like food/chems, and critical receiver mods, as well as damage resistance (armor) and damage reduction (% effects). That’s a much bigger project, though. 
---
Oh, that's good to know. I'm learning so much today!
---
wHaTs ThE FuSs AbOuT?
---
Weightless pieces ares good because you can do the light builds and reduce many of them to zero weight.
---
Wait, so taking an owned workshop, one of the mechanics of the game, is “griefing” now? Man, go back to playing 4 if you can’t handle a PvP game. 
---
Yea ive known that for a while...just wish theyd allow one unarmed in PA for once...I mean its a Concrete block w rebar ha.
---
Still i hate having to switch to my lesser build. In 76, im an unarmed character for the first time in any fallout game except NV for the trophy.
---
I also want that nurgle armor skin. And I do have a character that wears blue PA mostly and red helmet because that's what the ultramarine standard for a sergeant is ....
---
My 2 shot non explosive harpoon breaks faster than a Gatling laser so it’s not just TSE
---
I can test that. Flamers and Molotov’s. 
---
I’m usually adventuring and exploring instead of waiting around. However, if I’m at my camp, new players will have to pass by it to get to the overseer’s camp. If ya want somebody to play with, I’d be down. 
---
I LITERALLY WAS JUST THINKING THIS! AD VICTORIAM!
---
I have nearly all the outfits.. Its just the one am missing.. Plus my occupation is a Nurse l, so its just one of things 
---
Huge mistake no, small mistake maybe.  Since two shot got so badly nerfed it's useless and explosive damage did as well, a scorched rifle damage bonus isnt as good as maybe armor penetration or quad on a dps potential level.
---
To be great something with armor pen or quad, explosive, 10% dmg boost while aiming triple legendary 
---
You could probably outperform it tho with a scorched armor pen explosive hunting rifle with the 10% boost whole aiming, since you can swap the receiver to scorched adding an additional legendary mark, it would be a 4 star legendary hunting rifle.
---
I have the same issue and it is affecting me being able to share perks to other players. It so damn annoying bro!
---
That happens when someone shares a perk card
---
The first one is great! Sums up everything Fallout.
---
After a couple hundred nukes, bet I am... 
---
Maybe two items for another kinda like diablo 
---
Only saving 3s, but yeah
---
Apparently you were wrong about interiors though
---
Nah.  I get saturated with legendaries from one Nuke in Whitesprings. Not worth holding onto them now. Just taking up space. 
---
I run a bloodied+Swing Speed Bowie knife on my main. 
---
Hits for about 300-500 at a ludicrous speed. It’s hilarious really. I use all melee weapons and switch out my perks to what I’m feeling, and it out DPSs my Bloodied Swing Super Sledge which hits for about 1k. The only thing I have that isn’t lagging behind it is a Bloodied Swing Powerfist at 1.5k-3k. 
---
My point being the right knife with the right build, mainly Bloodied, makes for an awesome main. Outside of that, they are truly treated as a sidearm. 
---
Thank you all so much for your help! You are all very kind.
---
I just started the game. Level 10 I believe, I saw one guy who was level 43 and wanted but he didn't kill me, thank god. 
---
Would love to have a higher level player give me gear haha
---
🖐
---
I spotted one as well, a month or so ago.  I was hiding in a building from a Scorch Beast and started hearing these never-before heard noises.  Peak outside and the thing and the Scorch Beast are having a fight.  
---
I spent the past few nights camping my level 5 guy  at the WS clubhouse and I was alerted to the fact that I was lowering the spawn level of everything by just being there. I wonder if...
---
First of all, many many thanks for this post. I went through these locations today and even though I didn't find plans/mods/recipes at every single location you listed, I did find most of them. This is going to be very helpful in starting up my shop that sells plans!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I also spend some time just wandering today and came across a number of plans, recipes and mods. I don't know that if by finding them in these locations once, they will always spawn there. But in case you want to check the locations out for yourself, here's what I came across:
---
Ohio River Adventures \[P\]: in the green footlocker under the counter of the shack by the water
---
Camp Adams \[R\]: On a bench around the fire spit
---
Silva Homestead \[M\]: Under the chair in the 2nd floor bedroom
---
New River Gorge Resort \[P\]: In the footlocker under the bunkbed in the southern cabin
---
New River Gorge Resort \[P\]: Inside a toolbox in one of the cabins on the hill
---
New River Gorge Resort \[R\]: Inside a cooler in the kitchen of the cabin who's front door is blocked
---
Flatwoods \[R\]: In the fridge in the building across from the church
---
Gorge Junkyard \[R\]: On the kitchen counter
---
Landview Lighthouse \[R\]: 2nd floor of house next to lighthouse
---
Landview Lighthouse \[M\]: Top floor of lighthouse
---
WV Lumber Co. \[P\]: On a metal shelf in one of the small sheds, I think in SE corner-ish
---
Clancy Manor \[R\]: Kitchen counter
---
The Crosshair \[R\]: On top of a barrel in the back
---
Kiddie Corner Cabins \[P\]: On the bunkbed in the first cabin
---
Kiddie Corner Cabins \[P\]: On the desk / table next to the bunkbed in the 2nd cabin
---
\*Unmarked\* camp site between Clancy Manor and The Crosshair \[R\]: In the tent
---
Hopefully at least some of those could be helpful / added to your list!
---
Yup that happens sometimes. The trade-off is sometimes the nuked plants spawn outside nuked areas 
---
I honestly think the biggest mistake BGS made was not sincerely listening/ responding to the legitimate issues that people had with the dumbing down of fallout 4. That really set the tone for everything else. I get the frustration with the bugs and I agree that they've long lost their charm, but I think to real driving force is coming from the issues with fallout 4.
---
Thanks! I looked online but obviously my wording wasn't working and that makes sense now
---
How about 371 on a Bloodied Explosive 10mm SMG? 
---
Never mind the fact he can do that damage from a distance. Which a knife obviously can’t. 
---
I like this idea
---
Found mine with treasure maps
---
It’s appeared by my base twice now.... i was probably well over 200 hours before the first time 
---
Nah you just speak "brainwashed sheep".
---
Yes, I'm not really into PvP, but definitely know how when it's called for.
---
I have wanted a multiplayer version of FO for years, but never even considered they would make it a PvP game.
---
I used to enjoy PvP in Call of Duty, and even scored an 87 consecutive kill streak one time, and got a temporary ban while they reviewed my activity, because so many players thought I must be cheating to Kill them so many times.
---
I wasn't cheating, I just knew the maps &amp; understood the game better than most. 
---
U are sharing a perk
---
Yes. Quite a few people.
---
This goes back to FO4 where the 'Quieter Settlements' mod became a popular staple in people's load orders.
---
Depending on your stance on mods and platform - currently PC only - a kind person made a similar thing for FO76.
---
Had one spawn in a Queen battle. Crazy!
---
Saving all lightweight weapons and armor. 1,2 and 3 stars
---
I've seen and killed one top right of the map near a fissure site
---
Fusion generator is quiet. I think the missile turret is too since it runs on electricity.
---
No prob
---
It actually doesn't have any interiors. Or at least nothing notable. I spend a lot of time at harpers ferry.
---
Used to, but they actually fixed that a number of patches ago.
---
Sell them to other players.  They will probably pay good money.
---
Regarding workshops specifically, anytime you claim a workshop, you run the risk of PvP.  You acknowledged the warning.
---
The attacker owes you no explanation and has no commitment to the workshop.
---
I don’t feel levels matter with regards to PvP at workshops.
---
Outside of workshops, if you’re slapped and choose to retaliate, you’re accepting the risk of PvP.
---
Destroying a C.A.M.P.?  The attacker accepts the consequence of the WANTED flag.  
---
I recall being lvl 33 and shooting at a lvl 28 that completely wasted my trading time.  He chose to retaliate and his lvl 23 and lvl 18 friends chose to initiate PvP with me.  I died more times than they did (I was carrying junk with me, and everytime I went back for it they shot at me).  Yet they messaged me repeatedly calling me a griefer.
---
Long story short: I had fun;  they chose to participate in PvP (and even initiate it) and complained.
---
What a great idea!
---
I like this idea, however another change needs to occur along with it. 
---
If you contest a workshop and kill the owner, they can enter the area and stop the claim process, however since they've already been killed, they're no longer flagged as hostile. This needs to be changed as well as it allows them to just camp out and stop the claim process.  If the shop is contested, anyone inside the circle should be in PvP simply from entering since the shop is contested. 
---
Absolutely mate! Thank you for bringing me out my comfort zone too. Super appreciated :) 
---
To make use of the crits, you'll want close to 15 in Luck w/ 3 pts in crit savvy.  Seems like every third shot for me is a crit. 
---
I'm not really much of a trader, I usually just sell them to vendors.
---
.....
---
Or it was completely warranted and the game can still be fun for some people. The two are not mutually exclusive
---
What about chain explosions of cars? Where a car explodes because another car ignited it and only the first car was shot by a player.
---
Hit me up when you're on next.  I can help out.  GT: ThreeCirclesNet 
---
Saying that I haven’t heard of seen anything about the Super Sloth? Is it even in the game?
---
Thanks for this! Just tried with my first-ever nuke and it worked well. Got 30 violets, 20 crimsons and a mix of the rest. There's some all around the outside of the city, but south/southeast of Harpers in and around the river is the real gold mine. The flash ferns are very hard to see, so just slowly work your way through the brush areas and you'll find them. 
---
I can look in to these. I’m going to test flamers and Molotov’s right now. 
---
This is what I was hoping to hear more of.
---
I had to check and without the perk it breaks in 19 shots. I'm in the process of testing with the perk and editing the videos together to share proof.
---
The negative reviews make sense because the game isnt good on several levels. I dont think the game is terrible and I can still have fun with it but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done.
---
"Missed Opportunity" is Bethesdas middle name, at least the Fallout studios.
---
Noticed a bug. Have a buddy come and wreck your fusion generator, then take the bounty off him. Some reason when you log back, the powered turrents still operate and the mobs leave your base alone.
---
Hey, thanks for the tips. I am a crafting fool, and should be taking more XP critters than weak ass scorched. but I tend to skip events as some have been rough to run solo. 
---
 
---
I’ve done a few workshops, and clearing waves has been fun. but I’m kind of tired of being out classed by any player contesting it. I should be smart and take the Xp and run. 
---
I added a disclaimer at the start though; look good?
---
Disclaimer added ;)
---
Yeah definitely. Why not take it a step further though. You kill the owner during the contesting, you now own the workshop. I mean, you killed them why can they respawn and try to stop you?
---
I thought it was. Heard of it early on around the beta/release time but nothing since. I wasnt sure of what of these mythical creatures were in the game or not.
---
Lol I carry one and use it a lot. 
---
Agree
---
Don't tell me what to do, devil-woman!
---
I feel part of the hate FO76 received was built up angst over ALL the bugs and problems in their single-player games that have been ignored for years.
---
Another part was fanboys of other games.
---
And finally, just the whole internet echo chamber and wanting to fall in line with social convention.  I've mention, I have friends who played FO76, loved it, and returned it just because of the hate.  Their own lying eyes betrayed them I guess, YouTube reviewers are infallible.
---
It only has Super mutants which they don't mutate.  
---
I doubt its a good place to nuke but you can try ;)
---
lol yeah I feel ya. I used to hate that too. I’m at a different stage off annoyance now though.
---
Bring wanted is hardly a consequence
---
Done and Done! Thanks!
---
Were you in Power Armor with a HUD mod by chance? (Not making fun, happened to me is why I ask)
---
i found one as I was jumping down a tall cliff.. he was just hanging out on a small ledge of the mountain.  If I would have jumped 10 feet to the left or right I would have missed him.  
---
that was a 2 or 3 months ago.  he didnt have crap for loot, but at least I found out what he was
---
I know right? I'd love a reason to put a set of calibrated shocks on another leg. More mutations would be great too. Maybe have some that actually boost ranged damage :o because honestly... More options is always better 
---
I’ve never tried it with gunsmith 5 as I always run stabilized 3 and my intellligence is only 6. I’m sure it helps but unless it provides 4x the durability I can’t consider this a viable weapon. I used it a couple times but now it just sits broken in my stash box as I wait (hope) for them to fix this. 
---
Good question. Very specific scenario, but common enough in Whitesprings. I'll explore that soon.
---
yes indeed bicat. that was you makin a C.A.M.P.  down by the river! i dropped you off some plans what for to make yr house a home 🙂
---
you are by no means the first or last player this has happened with but your frustration and bewilderment inspired me to post this. happy trails! 🤘🏼
---
They're not common but they've always been there.
---
If you run along the river/ditch inbetween Charleston and the power plant a few times you'll get it to spawn.
---
LOL
---
I forgot one current bug, thats a bit of a  pain and related
---
If you have bulked items in your inventory and hit the scrap all button, it will break down the bulked items wasting the plastic used to bulk them. 
---
But placing the bulked items in your stash will keep them safe until you take them out to sell and they will auto break down in your stash if you use them during crafting.
---
There's a depth of field slider now.
---
That would be pretty cool. I know when I'm on an alt I hate going anywhere outside of the forest because they tend to have ridiculous spawns. Issues like these don't tend to get much traction though. A player over level 50 that doesn't make alts isn't going to notice or care. It's just an unnecessary barrier to entry for anyone just starting out. Once we have legendary characters that have to trudge through the low levels again it might get a bigger voice and more attention 
---
Nope.
---
They still become legendary and drop hardened mass and such tho
---
That's awesome man! (How do you send in pics to them?)
---
Hmmm. Odd then.
---
Start with the suggestions in this thread:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr
---
Thank you! I did it through Twitter with #Fallout76
---
What I noticed is you can just shoot them now. You just have to be inside the build area. I did that first thing after the patch and the guy shat himself. He was building stuff and I shot him in the face from way out (but within the build area) without contesting. Crazy is it even gave me coins for initiating combat. I guess if your both within the workshops build area, it's on now. I'm not sure if it's the other way around btw
---
Hmm so let's turn off auto stim drops I don't like those... And chameleon, that's useless to me I don't stealth... Maybe turn off armor drops too. I only use power armor and could care less about getting any armor 
---
Good pic, stop wearing my armor!!
---
Tactical Helmet. The combat Helmet isn't available. 
---
Do the Watoga bots re-agro if you kill them once you have done the quest to pacify them?? I have been so careful not to shoot any of them since then.
---
Ad Victorium! 
---
XD alas, I cannot. It's mine :p
---
PA already uses UC cores. Just have some in your inventory, run around for a bit and you'll discover they're missing. 
---
Found plans not only on the cabinet but also in the toolbox. Thanks for the tip!
---
Test results added
---
Nope. The one you're shooting might,  but I only ever kill one or two now and then
---
i agree, the flair gun right now is like one of those gag gift guns that just pop out the flag that says "bang!" when you pull the trigger
---
What's wrong?
---
It depends on the variant of the Mothman. If it's a vengeful or stalking Mothman it should stay and fight to the death.
---
I’d love to but your not joinable 
---
Send me a message 
---
Just looked and there isnt anything in the atom store and the expand option is greyed out when selecting the wave. The only one that has any expand possibility for me is the team up emote whcih changes to taking a photo. 
---
Yes.
---
[removed]
---
Depends on your build. I’m set up for sneak crits so massive upfront damage is key for me. I take down a lvl 50 sb in 2 shots, but if the fight goes on any longer than that, waiting to reload is a pain.
---
I am on this step as well and trying to also figure it out without cheating. My understanding is the codes we find are letter shifted to form a word and the Enclave printers figure out that word eventually on their own. I'm not sure yet if the printed out solution is the sequence of coded letters you find or what the word is after you decode the found letters.
---
How to decode is still a work in progress for me as I only have 5 letters atm.
---
&gt;go back to playing 4 if you can’t handle a PvP game.
---
Way ahead of ya buddy.  Playing Falliout 4 now and honestly don't care to go back to 76.  I hope I'm one of many.
---
I love Grahm! He helped me defend my workshop last week - it was magical! 
---
I miss the ramblings and observations of NPCs - especially location/plot specific ones. 
---
I can’t inspect it, but in the earlygame having the weapon, armor, and tinker table with walls is all I would look for in a camp.
---
Yes I have heard of that happening and something similar has happened to me. My friend and I (lvl \~50 at the time) saw a wanted player on the map and they weren't too many levels above us. When we tried to attack they were a bullet sponge and swiped at us once with a deathclaw gauntlet and boom - we were dead. This was before the major duper patch, so it's possible they were stacking melee bobbleheads. 
---
I just think it's a texture glitch..I see super mutants like that too sometimes 
---
Probably bobble stacking. They may have changed the slap damage mechanics too when they supposedly fixed that issue. 
---
This has been patched. 
---
Sorry- I totally would if you were level 14 and 30 years old ;)
---
I'll add you. Next time I see you on I'll stop by.
---
I saw a nuke dropped on *Uncanny Caverns* this afternoon. To say the outcome was underwhelming is on point. I think the guy must have sneezed when targeting Whitesprings.
---
She could be wrong - people make mistakes.
---
Would be kind of OP. The mole miner gauntlet and deathclaw gauntlet both do pretty high damage for medium speed melee weapons. Being able to do that in power armor would be ridiculous.
---
Damn so close haha
---
I've heard the bleed damage effect of Talons can do so.
---
Have them show up as fake bottle caps under misc or something if the other player has the perk. 
---
What does nuking do?
---
We did this last night, I server hopped until I found a Golf Club building that was stuck spawning Glowing Ones, then had a friend join. 
---
Once it was set up, we just farmed ir all night 3+ hours of spawning Glowing Ones. People came and left, but we all just kept on killing and looting meat piles. I'd re-login and join my friend on this server and the instance would reset. Rinse repeat. Level 138-&gt;140.
---
That was a long sentence 
---
Like the guy said, check with vendors. Also, check any containers near by, lots of people drop stuff into suitcases and lunch boxes near the vendors.
---
Also try hanging out in the Whitesprings hotel if it gets nuked (if you can get there), lots of people just drop all the stuff they don’t want in the hallway with the shops.
---
As for legendary mobs, some events have guaranteed legendaries like leader of the pack, just off the top of my head.
---
Also try Watoga, there’s usually a legendary boy wandering around, and if you complete “mayor for a day” all the Watoga bots turn non-hostile from then on
---
Played Doom PC
---
This would also provide a larger incentive to fight over workshops as taking one could mean more lucrative rewards in the locked collectors. Also a larger enticement to steal their contents. 
---
A screwed up ini file? GREAT. I did not think of that as a possibility.
---
You can. There's a mod on Nexus
---
By great he means that it will be the same useless trash, but you'll hit more targets.
---
I don't think the tesla shoots explosive anymore.  I could be wrong but I think it is grouped in with the cryolator and plasma Gatling that won't spawn like that and those that were explosive had the effect removed if I remember correctly.
---
Why can't they both be a griefer and take pleasure in a taking over a fully working workshop? 
---
I didnt know this would cause them to re-spawn..thx
---
I'm going to guess it was related to the workshop pvp mechanics. I'm sure people were exploiting that system before it became common knowledge. In case you don't know, you could have claimed a workshop and then gone off somewhere on the map. Two people on a team split up, one hiding at your current location and the other at the workshop. The one at the workshop initiates a takeover and then stops and the other at your location can now fire on you in full PVP mode with full damage and you have no idea what hit you. Just one possible explanation.
---
I was reading one of the previous posts on this subject. One of the commenters stated they had not used mods, but was still able to fix the problem using the solution for people that had. I wish I had saved that post. 
---
I just want my hot rod flames and my military paint from fallout 4 but nope 3 months later nothing.
---
I've tried all these places with no luck. How strange. 
---
Pretty cool but pretty useless since it's not a lever action. 
---
The old ones still have the explosive effect.  
---
Got some of that brick stuff?
---
Super Sloth is in game. My camp is right by Treehouse Village and at least twice when I’ve fast traveled there one has been waiting. They go down pretty easy and are really fast like that loading screen makes it sound. 
---
I think we have different definitions of griefing. I was just responding to your idea that they would be mad you’re destroying the workshop, if they’re truly just griefing then they won’t care one bit imo.
---
Sometimes I log on to a server and the ammo shop is taken, I know I could just server hop and find a new one but that would take an extra 5 minutes, I’d rather message the person asking them what type of ammo they need and usually I have extra of that and they give me the workshop to make .45 or 556.
---
And yeah sometimes I claim a workshop to pvp but only to lvls 70 or higher as I figure they’ve experienced the game enough and I’m not making a bad first impression of the game for them.
---
Thank you for the followup. Your research is valuable for a number of reasons. It not only stops the rampant rumors and speculation that do nothing but hurt the game and those of us actually ejoying it for what it is, but it will also give piece of mind to those playing PvE in ever fear of the PvP griefer boogeyman. Keep it up!
---
Do u have one
---
What I do if it's a power plant and it needs to be powered up and someone takes the workshop I'll let them and not finish up powering up whatever. Its something little but then they will have to find where i left off. 
---
I killed the thus far took photos the first 2 times
---
There are..there's a bunch in harpers
---
Yeah but u need to formulate a plan to not get defeated..my low level ales basically were trained at WS
---
Excellent.
---
Canned dog food is the best item in the game. Endurance perks not so much. I got 1 point in the dog food card and that's it. 
---
I didn't really even venture to Watoga till about level 45
---
Can’t trust everyone and everything...
---
I heard Grahm is about to start fucking up camps along his path for all the times we try to kill him. 
---
Is there a way of wiring it so if you don't pick the 'open' switch first, one of the others being activated actually deactivates the open switch? So there's no way out if you pick the wrong one?
---
Also, what plan unlocks it? According to thst bigass imagur post it is just "Plan: Siren" but I haven't seen that ANYWHERE.
---
It spawns glowing ones (turns ghouls into powerful enemies with a ton of xp) and it turns all of the flora into valuable nuked flora..also known as flux..u should get a hazmat suit as early as possible 
---
It actually heals them.
---
Do you want some advice or guidelines on how to optimize a farm run?
---
yep!!
---
No, I was just curious to see if someone was still offering them.  They don't drop anymore so probably pretty rare. 
---
That's a good point.  I don't know, I think that in the very near future the griefers aren't going to have workshops to prey upon. 
---
Because of the recent patch, there has been a noiticeable uptick in people starting fights at workshops. 
---
People take over workshops to get ***just a little more resources,*** in addition to what they gather out on in the world.  They simply don't produce enough to make it worth fighting over.  They never did. Thanks to the patch, which now allows them to contest the place without interacting with the red work bench, the invaders now have the advantage. For those who want the resources, the workshops are simply not worth it now.
---
Because of the multiple star mechanic, and the prevalence of drops at the Legendary farm sites, people are starting to bank 2 and 3 starred items, 1 star items are still considered "vendor trash".
---
I haven’t been able to from XB1 and PS4 and I play characters on each console on the same Bethesda account (both show linked in my account).
---
I just sold 2 to a vendor. Lol got like 2 caps for them.
---
Jerry rigging a powerfist onto a power suit seems like just the sort of thing a raider power armor suit maker would do.
---
Oh dang! I need one! I have a gas mask at least
---
Oh that's what it is then! I always tried having this perk on at lvl2 to fill a 2 points gap and it never worked.not once.
---
I'm gonna try the lvl3 version now thx.
---
U def need hazmat suit..go to the watoga shopping center ..the robot vendor (Phoenix) has one 
---
Nope the game sucks. 
---
said this from the begin buff mob density nerf mob xp
---
Oh. I'm not the person you were replying to.
---
I was only addressing the part I commented on.
---
Stopping snapping altogether is not a good idea but being able to hold (button) and then have free rotation would be awesome.
---
Yeah but the old system where you could build around the red work bench was bad too, there should be a middle ground and if you’re not at the workshop then you shouldn’t be able to be PvP’ed, I think that’s too easy to exploit. 
---
I’ve been getting tons of flux lately there. But in all the ws zones I’ve done, I’ve never actually been able to get any violet flux. Usually the snap tails don’t even turn. I’ve only ever seen them turn to crackle tails (or whatever they’re called) once, and it wouldn’t actually let me pick them for some reason. 
---
Oh my b, I always forget to look and just assume it was the same person who responded. Maybe that means I’m looking to argue too much idk, I like discussing things about the game tho because inevitably I think it creates good ideas for Bethesda to incorporate in the future. 
---
Sounded scripted, but hilarious either way
---
I got a ghoul slayers radium rifle the other day...  You deal more damage but also heal them at the same time. It's like the ultimate passive aggressive weapon. 
---
Not the lights ,you monster!
---
Thank you sweet sweet person. 
---
Yeah the upcoming skins are pretty awesome. 
---
Id like to be able to paint it myself but.. a boy can dream
---
Well it always depends on if you are by yourself or alone. If you are alone with those super high level enemies, you get squished. If your friend happens to be said high level, then you may get lots of experience.
---
In my case it was by myself.. so that sucked.
---
I hope you're right, but I swear I remember seeing some 60+ mobs at the Morgantown airport before.  My point isn't just that high level spawns are a problem though, they are definitely the bigger problem.  I may be in the minority, but I feel that low level spawns are also a big issue due to lack of challenge and reward for high level players.  And that there may be some grumbling by high level players when the first new quest content has no challenge for them whatsoever.
---
I completely agree with your ideas on the timer and have some pretty similar experiences with causing and dealing with spawns.
---
I want to add one thing though, and that's that I'm not hoping the devs go through and make all spawns static.  Some of the most fun, challenging, and frustrating game experiences have been due to the spawn mechanics.
---
I'd like to see them limit the randomness, but keep the better elements and make sure that there's at least some hint you might be facing something unusual.  For instance, alarms triggering which result in additional spawns, fighting your way in through overly easy enemies only to have to fight your way back out through tough ones, and new mechanics which could be applied to the wendigo you mentioned being a shared target, with shared quest item drops like the code ghouls, that regenerates quickly over time so that players have to kill him, quickly loot and then get out before he gets back up or have to face him again rather than have piles of that same dead body in that cave.
---
I think nuclear zones dissipate after about an hour or two. So I don't think it would work. 
---
What is broken for you that you can't play?
---
Staged for sure, still a great vid.
---
Cool idea. I didn’t even realize about the ore thing (everyone launches in places short on ore). 
---
So how I had to do that is to control the power that’s going to the switches from up top. I tell the victim to pick one switch and one switch only. Because the first power switch I throw is to the three trap switches. If he chose the right one, nothing will happen. When I flip the other power switch which controls the door, it should open. I haven’t figured out a way for it to do it on its own, I still have to monitor the trap.
---
I could set the correct switch up on one of the interior walls that is designed to break upon trap activation. This will essentially deactivate the correct switch if it no longer is present.
---
I tested hunger... i noticed no increase. My damage on my rifle stayed at 562 until i died of starvation.
---
Sounds like something a synth spy would say.....
---
Golded. Nice job compiling all this.
---
My two cents is that there was enough anecdotal stuff out there to completely believe that an exploit or multiple exploits combined Captain Planet style allowed the “fatal slap” to be a real thing but that particular method or combo may no longer apply.
---
At any rate, it does make a good case for things getting better with the Pacifist mechanics, a good thing all around...
---
You can absolutely solo a nuke silo at level 76. Just bring around 10-15 stimpaks, plus water and food, along with a sturdy suit of power armor.
---
You cant use unarmed weapons in PA? Hmm there goes my next character plan, might just finally do pistol then.
---
I’d say at least 72 others. 
---
Its a glitch, happens to me sometimes as well. Seems like it could be card sharing related or something but basically if someone runs through and has the HUD helm on it light them up for everyone. And on occasion i have spawned into a server where all enemies across the map were highlighted as well 
---
Well Anthem at least had a story(kinda shitty). Fallout 76 does have anything after you drop the nuke on the Scorchqueen.
---
Congrats on the impression
---
Should've killed him and then put the gears in his dropped junk.
---
I have a vampiric one that I carry around just to refill my health. It's only level 35 so the damage is crap, but good for burning through low level enemies. Luck of the Draw also procs constantly with the buzz blades so I never have to repair it. 
---
Why didn't I think of that..lol
---
I like a claw mod. Let it consume a claw to craft, and the mod gets the specs of the base weapon...
---
I really appreciate the feedback I’m getting, believe it or not I somehow dropped or sold my instigating cultists blade I was talking about in my original comment, and have my entire build built around melee. So I’m desperate. 
---
I am Count "Fore"mula
---
Whitesprings bunker. 
---
Tbh, I'd consider that a form of griefing due to the stalking issue. You were being targeted repeatedly by someone who was only interested in killing you. One time, maybe even two, is one thing, but deliberately following from workshop to workshop until they can finally engage and kill you? That's something else.

---
i dont see any "farm" , if they limit the caps just 1400 per day. 
---
Ah yeah, very true
---
They are now mostly from maps, random plan spawns in the cranberry bog around watoga and the BoS quest forbidden knowledge.
---
You are a good man! Many thanks!
---
I think 76 was received so harshly because of Bethesda’s previous success. Fallout 3, Oblivion, Skyrim, and Fallout 4 were massively successful games. I think with the announcement at E3 that they were going in a different direction with 76 made people nervous and sowed the seeds of doubt. 
---
I think 76 is a great game and I commend Bethesda on trying new and exciting things, even if it isn’t safe and familiar for them.
---
 I wish more developers would take risks like this. Was it controversial? Oh yeah! Was it intimidating for the fans and developers? No doubt. Is it a fun game with a potential to grow? Heck yeah!!
---
I have a great time playing this game and I’m really looking forward to watching it expand and develop over time.
---
The only thing that works as intended 100% of the time is the Atomic Shop. What is not broken that you keep playing? And the 'fun with friends' is a moot point, you can have fun with your friends while playing with a bag of actual shit.
---
It’s a drop from completing the Power Up events at the power plants.
---
It's hardly a 'pvp game.' It's a survival game with some pvp components that the developers are trying to force. Hopefully when the pvp mode starts that will take most people that want that. 
---
Get them for free by doing powerplant events
---
Has more of a Jeepers creepers feel to me.
---
Lol, looks like a purse derringer in your hand. 
---
Bought mine from Graham
---
And my pants... wait THAT CAME OUT WRONG AND THAT TOO. UHH I MEANT LIKE KETCHUP NOT  YOU KNOW🤔🤔🤔
---
It's not high on my priority list.  
---
Considering how BGS is putting out all this crap physical items instead of fixing the problems has me disappointed in them. The jacket that looks like cheap trash bag material despite a more leathery looking promo picture for example.
---
I dunno, i rarely run into game stopping problems. Unintended consquences probably and poor balance definitely. Explosive weapons are mostly useless unless they are grenades. Some monsters T-Pose and they are usually ghouls which i only notice at whitesprings which is kinda buggy. The game never crashes on me and i ran all over the place.
---
I really wanted to play with the single shot grenade launcher, but that is game balance. Quests trigger properly for me and all that jazz. I also game on an older system (fx8320 amd with r9 280x with a 1360x768 monitor which requires special configs to even play) so i should run into walls more often than your average player.
---
Bethesda hasn't really balanced a game they have had since... forever tbh. This is the first time they actually HAVE to try to balance their game. Usually they just build an environment, plug in a bunch of lore, and hit the print money button. People have expectation this time, i just know that this kind of stuff.... isn't Bethesda's strong point.
---
Grahm once saved me from a Deathclaw. I'm forever in his debt that fine soul 
---
Okay obviously this is an annoying bug but.... It is kinda funny that deathclaws have such a taste for generators. 
---
What would be the OP part about doing it w/ PA specifically? Honestly asking ... do you think the defense of PA would make the Mole Miner Gauntlet over-the-top good?
---
The reason I brought it up was because they must have adjusted how slap damage worked because your results didn't match mine.
---
If you haven't tried them already you might enjoy some of the events.  Particularly the ones where you're following around a robot, like Messenger, Census Violence, Back on the Beat, Irrational Fear, etc.
---
It's more goal oriented than just following Grahm around, but they also toss out some pretty funny little quips and some have hilarious endings.  The Messenger going to Flatwood is still one of my favorites.
---
What's a king ghoul? the one with the crown on his name?

I’m level 99 and my camp is still just a big workbench for everyone to use by the Watoga station. I put it there for the free travel on that side of the map. Anything by the forest I’ll get free travel to 76 first to reduce cost. 
---
Ill keep u in mind next time I need a building plan!
---
Sure, here goes:
---
Coop Farming Whitesprings, a quick Primer by HappyCamper781
---
Whitespring Golf Club is an instanced spawn with a relatively high % of legendary spawns and drops. Like all instances it will spawn when conditions are met, mainly:
---
There are not active spawns currently in the spawn area.
---
There are no players already in the spawn area (not consistent).
---
Every new player that arrives in the spawn area when those 2 conditions are met will trigger a new spawn of all set of Ghouls in the spawn area, plus one "Boss" creature. This will be either a Glowing One or a Wendigo (50% chance of either). Spawns will of course scale to level of person triggering, but will cap at 42 / 62 for Ghouls, 58 for Glowing Ones, and 42 for Wendigos. Lower level of the triggering player, lower levels of the spawns. If Nuke Effect is active, replace Ghouls with Glowing Ones, with slight enhanced % of Legendary spawns/drops.
---
Once killed, the spawns degrade over time into meat piles that occasionally displace slightly from where a body fell. There are occasional glitches (worse when lag is present) that result in clipping errors, sometimes this leads to unreachable loot, so where you kill something is slightly important. Killing a spawn on the grass near a plant is risky, as it can knock the meat pile "behind" the plant's loot radius, making that loot pile unreachable. A work-around is to go third person view and "look up" from under it, but it's difficult to pull off in the middle of a fight. Likewise, killing spawns inside the Golf Club building is occasionally problematic as dead bodies / meatpiles are occasionally "knocked" into the floor / through a wall / under the stairs.  Optimally the best place to kill them for maximized loot are the walkways outside or the parking lot outside, or the golf cart area outside. Be aware that making the bus or other vehicles "explode", while pretty, will send ragdoll bodies (and loot piles) EVERYWHERE. 
---
How XP Works in a coop instance:
---
Everyone who "tags" (does some damage on a hit) to a spawn will get FULL XP off that spawn once it's killed. The methodology should be to everyone to maximize XP by "killing them slowly" enough to not let them overwhelm the party, and lets everyone "Tag" as many spawns as possible. There are certain bugs and issues to this system based on weapons (See below). In practice, a few folks up on vehicles as fire support with rapid fire ballistic weapons, people who are skilled with explosives (to minimize friendly fire issues) are going to be the maxed out winners here. There need to be a few Tanks/Melee DPS (damage per second) folks on the ground "pulling" the mass of spawns. They are generally the ones making the "kills" over time, but get the least chance to "tag" everything. Higher levels who are more experienced with Melee are recommended for this role.
---
Loot and Loot Hygiene:
---
Loot works on the same premise as XP. Everyone who "tags" a spawn gets an INDIVIDUAL instance of randomized loot. Each spawn that is killed will land in a ragdoll body that degrades over time into a meat pile. These are PERSISTENT until EVERYONE WHO TAGGED IT HAS LOOTED IT OR LOGGED OFF. This means that if you don't practice good Loot Hygiene, a Golf Club instance will quickly build up a high # of meat piles with resultant massive amount of Loot-related data for all the participating players. This WILL cause lag as you stress the server this way. "Good Loot Hygiene" is having everyone aggressively loot all meat piles and ragdolls as soon as the spawn killing is done. Deposit all unwanted loot in central locations (Ice Machine, Trash Cans) or away from the instance to minimize server stress by having to track so many individualized objects. (Objects placed in containers are not individualized and cause less server load)
---
BUG: Kills performed with Energy Weapons that result in alternate loot piles (Glowing goop, ash piles) appear to be unlootable and persistent, increasing server load over time if they are left alone. This affects what weapons you should use to get the killing shot on the spawns. (Tesla Rifle can be used to tag spawn group, but should be avoided for mass-kill-shots).
---
Sample Methodology:
---
Lead/Melee will place himself at the choke point (front door of Golf Club. Range / Gun users place themselves on top of the Bus and / or other vehicles in the Parking Lot. Backup Melee members interspersed on ground around parking lot. Melee/lead initiates buy walking up to open the front door and maybe running downstairs and back out, then stands to one side of front door and smacks each spawn going by. Gun users aim for front door and spray and pray/tag. Melee DPS members in parking lot finish off everything with kill shots. 
---
Once the "mob" is down, Melee / lead pulls a sweep of downstairs to "flush" any remaining stuck spawns (usually a few especially downstairs in the pro shop behind the counter) and leads them back up. The Wendigo is known to wander and there are occasionally a few rogue spawns out back by the Golf Carts and the Patio. A few Radstags sometimes wander by and get caught up in the festivities. Also the Shower downstairs spawns a few Radroaches that occasionally wander up.  Nothing that can't be handled by a decent group.
---
Post kills, everyone spends a few mins looting / sorting items, and dropping unwanted loot / trading using the shared containers (Ice Chest, Trash cans, dropped bags). Once everyone is done, everyone exits the building and a volunteer who has a friend in the group logs out, and logs back in and Joins his friend. This resets the instance, repeat from start.
---
Hope this is useful for everyone.
---
Found it at watoga plaza vendor
---
Okay I give you that Harper's Ferry may be completely devoid of doors and every building might be open, but there's a direct example of what I mean the game. The Harper's Ferry Armory? Definitely big enough to make into an interior cell. It may seem small but it's comparable to Watoga EMS in size, and that's an almost guaranteed legendary haha
---
Happy cake day ;)
---
Is it really that rare? In 100ish hours I’ve probably seen it like 5 times?
---
It’s true... all of it. 
---
I'm level 110, pretty solid build, and got one-shotted with some melee weapon today. I have pacifist on, and was at my own camp, not in a contested workshop zone. How, idk. 
---
Yeah, I’m so tired of trying to frantically wave and shoot at loot bags on the ground to get people to take my free shit!
---
Lights absolutely murder your budget as well, between 1-3% a pop.
---
I get the urge to prevent players from over placing turrets and lights as I imagine its harder on the server but shit just put a finite limit like 4/5 turrets, with HMG/LMG/Shotgun taking up less budget.
---
But.  But. Bobbleheads and forced PVP and..WHY ARENT YOU BELIEVING EVERY LIE THAT'S TOLD ON REDDIT? 
---
Depends if it’s colored it’s valuable if it’s white or weathered it’s vendor for caps 
---
Was never proven to actually happen. 
---
It's not a asylum worker it's called a nurse uniform never seen it before
---
I also hope we can put magazines on the racks among other things.
---
Oh cool! Are they expensive? I think i have 300 caps. I'm new.
---
I’ll add you. I’m level 45 right now and would enjoy having some people to play with instead of living the solo life. 
---
Yea not worth much unfortunately but if you go to fort defiant and find colored uniforms those are worth some major caps in order of least to most rare weathered, white, brown, green, blue, pink, yellow, red, forest. The hats aren’t worth more then 20 caps to a person but them unis are worth max caps the rarer ones 
---
9 hours minimum in the same server 
---
Also, super sledge needs a silencer mod, heh.
---
Oh sweet, I’ll try next session. Thx.
---
Cool, I’ll check more out. I’ve only tried a few in the past.
---
Once you get around level 25 the great screw shortage will be over. Not exactly sure why this happens.
---
I can't believe you really said the game is good. Must not be a fallout fan
---
When I get buzzed, I take my higher level player into the easy areas and harvest everything. I then put it at the OS camp or try to give it to people under 20. I always try to help at low level events, but if I one shot something, I drop the low level guns and point at it and wave. That being said, if they want to start some pvp, I'm a pacifist (in game), but they will quickly find out what a two shot gun can do. 
---
Strange place to be posting if you genuinely think the game sucks.  Go find something you enjoy and try being positive for a change. 
---
Pretty sweet. Bummer that 2 of them dropped at level 45.
---
You lost me when you started screaming like an ass hat. I hate that YouTube trend. 
---
Nope still want more stash space
---
It’s a typo. Supposed to read “Stanking” Mothman. You can actually see the odor cloud.
---
I do love how much light they put out, but I have a homey home, so it wouldn't look good in mine
---
These weapons, like all(most?) weapons in the game, can be effective with the right build
---
This would make a really good secret Santa event for x-mas.
---
Yeah it would be cool if when idling the rocket turns off
---
Two Shot legendary prefix reduce your durability by a lot. My two shot minigun only lasts for 4-5x super mutants lv 68.
---
Eh, if I run across 2/3 star low weight ones I'll do that too, but mostly it's weight.
---
Someone else in  the area had a targeting HUD on their PA or seems to affect everyone in the area
---
To be honest, I'm not going out of my way to save them.
---
I do have some weirdo 3\* items that I might consider re-rolling if that was possible, though.  They sit there taking up an annoying amount of space because I have a hard time bringing myself to ditch anything with 3\*.
---
Make sure you tag loose screws for search, from your pip boy (crafting stations too I think?).  Then you'll see a magnifying glass icon on any junk which can be scrapped for them.
---
Most areas have at least a few of those junk items, to the point that you can expect to get 5-20 screws clearing them if you're sure to pick up the right items, and it hasn't already been looted by someone else.
---
Like others have said though, "offices" like Sugar Grove and the two nearby National buildings tend to be a great source of them, and springs/gears/lead.
---
That sounds like a good plan
---
*I just want to customer service you!  Please!!!*
---
there is a firey landmine. is called the "Blast Mine" it looks a bit cool. but i could never kill with them (mostlydue to lack of attempt)
---
I get 3 or more cores with mine with rank 5 gunsmith 
---
I have started popping in at low level events where there is a newbie. Help them clear some quick and easy challenge, put away weapon and give a thumbs up/come here emote. They are much less skittish this way.
---
Also, two of them. 
---
Man sometimes Reddit makes me mad. The only comment to my post that got an upvote was the one saying I am probably just wrong. I submitted a support ticket and hopefully we will see something happen.
---
Mind sharing the perks used?
---
Watched a little bit of Anthem gameplay from various streamers, seemed like it could be a decent game. I doubt it will give me the thrill Fallout 76 gives me, if I were to ever buy Anthem on sale. I’ll be playing Fallout 76 for a while.
---
No like 150 caps????
---
Wowow thank u
---
Maybe it's because Anthem is still somewhat fresh, and has gotten a few updates already, as it's quite obvious BW is listening to its playerbase. Most games of it's genre starts out a bit bumpy but picks up steadily. Hell, they even made changes to loot drops, because people asked for it. 
---
Honestly, I'd say Anthem's backlash isn't even deserved to be fair. Fresh game, some bugs (most of the big ones) have been fixed. Only problems are lack of an in-depth endgame and customization, both of which according to BW, will be expanded upon greatly sometime this month and onward. So, it took BW less than a month to make major improvements to Anthem, where as it took Bethesda several months just to get the game in a somewhat stable condition.
---
I've been playing nothing but Anthem since it released and tbh, it's the most fun I've had in a game in years. Unlike 76, the dev team listens and rolls out patches frequently, and they don't add like 20 new bugs in said patches. Plus, BW doesn't have big issues like lawsuits, nylon bag incidents, wrongful ban issues, and lack of communication/care like 76's devs seem to have had the first 3 months.
---
Do you have to keep the perk selected while you're using it? Or just when you craft it?
---
And sorry if this is a dumb question but what do you mean by getting your lever action to max durability? Do you mean the over-repair perk? Or did you just get max int when you crafted one?
---
I admit it, I'm a dirty Ghoul Farmer....
---
I’m going to remake my camp to make it look like a military base. Station G4RD3N.
---
You're welcome, Happy Farming!
---
But... that's true? Have you seen lod comparisons between Fallout 4 and Fallout 76? 76 *does* use a new lighting engine called [enlightened](https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/middleware/enlighten/en/features/). 
---
Especially hard to deal with when you're trying to reload your the dragon and it staggers the animation at the end so you have to repeat the whole process. I died way to many times to this turn of events when it comes to them bears. 
---
My guy is level 347 and I am unable to turn in technical data.  Recruitment blues was bugged for me.  Somehow I completed the quest without doing the DMV portion of it. Basically I can hand people technical data one at a time and let them cash in for big xp and loot.  I had to make a new guy to get my platinum trophy though. 
---
I meant like my then lever. It was before the 200% I believe at like 90% of that full. I bought and made enough to roll one that I could get 200% on. 
---
Yeah when I show up to the golfclub with my friends and if it's dead we just leave lol 
---
Yes! Yes! Yes! Why isn't this a thing? 
---
What level is everyone’s sword that found it? I just found one and never seen it before but mine is only level 25. 
---
Who won? 
---
That was a fantastic picture. Hope this doesn’t go to your head and make you BATTY. 
---
I fully agree with this plea. My PA woes are normally along the lines of Excavator and "the one I picked up to scrap" but it still takes 2X as long to deal with them and I'm always paranoid that I am scrapping the wrong one. 
---
Ah thanks man 
---
Some very good, constructive discussion here. This feedback, as always, is seen by the dev team, but I'll be sure to share this thread now as well.
---
What locations aside from Whitesprings do you all think already fill this role well? I.e. Watoga has been mentioned a few times.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

---
So what’s a first uniform worth? Picked one up last night; first time there. 
---
 So that's with very little health then. I can do almost 250 at most ranges with my Lever Action if you toss in the stealth multiplier. I only shoot from a crouch and am pretty stealthy. The 250 will one shot most things.
---
 That's the problem, for me with a bloodied build, its just too close to death for open combat. I'm not giving up my Jet Pack leaps into hordes of enemies with my tiny knife. Melted many ghouls just a few minutes ago at a nuked Whitespring. Its amazing my new toy and I was starting to feel bad as they die so quick. ;) A bit selfish in that environment.
---
Fallout 76 carries the baggage of past Fallouts.  Anthem doesn't.  Fairly or not, 76 ends up getting judged by what it does, or doesn't, do compared to other Fallout games.  A lot of players have a very narrow-minded vision of what Fallout is supposed to be.  And, for that matter, 76 tried to be a lot of different things at once, and you usually leave the hardcore players unhappy when you do that.
---
Not having played Anthem, I'd also go out on a limb and suggest that Anthem probably explains itself a lot better than 76 does.  There are quite a few quality-of-life perks and gameplay mechanics in 76 that I don't think reviewers actually noticed, like scrapping for mods, which led to them being under-powered and under-equipped throughout the game.  I think for Bethesda fans, having that kind of ambiguity and learning curve isn't a negative thing, but it is for the broader gaming populace these days.
---
I was just doing the natural progression, bouncing through areas till I got to abbeys bunker in the mire, then I just sorta *zoomed through* because I hate the mire. Every 20 meters there's another group of super mutants, or double wendigo attack, or scorchbeasts.
---
Great!   And thanks for using “fracas”!
---
Max caps or any weapon or armor of your choice
---
Wearing a clown suit seems to improve things 
---
Lmfao! The screams! Nicely done sir!
---
Dang. I meet all requirements except I play on Xbox. 
---
Also are you positive it’s forest and not green forest just has a dark green line down the middle and green is a solid color
---
For real. I had 5 of the square color lights on either side of a door and it's 1% each. :(
---
All the time 
---
Weapon artisan is the one that gives you 200% durability 
---
I'll look at it tomorrow, but that doesn't sound like it's worth it. 
---
If you're with friends, just set up and have someone relog, then farm on.

---
My first log in today..got a nuke zone :)
---
Maybe it has a splinter. 
---
Skynet
---
This is my assumption for most cases, but it's still possible the mechanics were different in the past and have subsequently changed.
---
This absolutely will be my assumption for any CURRENT claims, unless overwhelming evidence otherwise is displayed.
---
Results added.
---
Hopefully you get this - just wanted to say I've already listened to three episodes in Google Play. Fantastic podcast - it's a pleasure to listen to people who are playing the game and enjoy it, but who are also cognizant of the many areas in which it needs to improve. Will definitely recommend!
---
If you can get some addiction that helped me out
---
The I Am Become Death quest leads you to an area beneath Mama Dolce's where a terminal talks about a keyword that can be used to decipher the nuke codes but there is no printer that just gives you the correct code. Starting wednesday every week 1 letter will be put up inside the enclave bunker command area and by the end of the week the entire keyword will be complete. You're supposed to use that and manually figure out the launch codes. 
---
Actually, found a good writeup over here
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ygyy9/stepbystep_guide_to_decrypting_launch_codes/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Did you own a workshop, though? They can initiate contesting a workshop and travel to you, you will be considered in PVP anywhere on the map once they initiate contesting it. 
---
I don't like this mechanic, and I do believe it should be changed, but it is how it works currently.
---
What does the printer below the letter board actually do?
---
I usually make a full run around Harper's Ferry when I vend there, and get usually 2-3 legendaries when the place is populated by ghouls.
---
Horde events are always good for a \*\*\* boss.  The level is hit or miss, but I got this [combat rifle](https://imgur.com/7cXTTsp) today in the mire while doing the horde event that happened to be right next to Fort Defiance.  I was riding high after that dropped.  My rifleman will love it when legendary respec is a thing.  I think most people are also savvy to the legendary bosses you get in Uranium Fever, as well.
---
But yes, I would love a different option besides Whitesprings and Watoga.
---
Yup, fair point that this may not be how it worked in the past, thus me adding the disclaimer
---
This is correct. I tested this just now.
---
Yeah, I think I did somewhere on the map. Like way across the map. I guess that's it. That is a dumb game mechanic 
---
I saw this too and it's a good explainer of how to decrypt manually. I think there's something else missing though. Other people were able to get a print out.. 
---
I have one with the automatic barrel if that’s fine.  Send me an offer, GT BenevolentDM 
---
Interesting...  
---
 I have there a few times but am fairly high level. I took my X0-1 and Nocturnal Combat Knife there tonight and must apologize.  I was having so much fun just destroying them I did not realize till a guy thumbed me down that I was hogging the pack. I then tried to half kill as many as I could but that was far more difficult.
---
 tl:dr I went nuts with my Nocturnal 40% Speed 200% Repaired Combat Knife hitting at around 180, and I guess about 5 times a second. ;) Sorry for being a pig.
---
I agree with the difficulties of navigating the silos, the constant robots, and markers disappearing. I spent 3 hours on my first (and only) attempt. Was nearly done when a group of 4-6 players stormed in,  all at least double my rank. In the mayhem that followed I was easily overtaken and after respawning multiple times, I ended up missing the launch. I will mention that the players who stormed in did their best to protect and assist me. But afterwards I was out of all chems, food, water, and down to a couple hundred rounds of ammo total. I had never been so disheartened from a video game. 
---
I got a printout once before I knew what it was for, but that's after the AI at the Enclave solves it. Other than waiting for it, I don't know how to help speed that process. Maybe trying to launch help it find letters?
---
I managed to kill him twice
---
Maybe try watching videos on bikes to save time it’s what I did and I can run a silo solo in 30-45 mins also to save from loosing ammo when replacing master cores equip a melee weapon
---
No offense, but it's pretty easy to launch a nuke and maybe they just thought you were working with them. What platform are you on? We try to launch everytime we play together.
---
I'm not sure I follow but I will go look. You say there's a printer in the bunker below Mama Dolce's?  Or are you talking about the Enclave command center? 
---
I guess I wasn't looking to speed it up, I just wanted to know about that and what happens. 
---
Do you just wait until a certain day?
---
That’s pure assholery. I sometimes enter silos to see if the players that have been stuck in there for 45+ mins need help. I grind through the silo with them, then let them launch it. Just common courtesy, especially since my aid was unsolicited. What platform was this on?
---
No harm no foul. Ghouls are a renewable resource if you have friends who can relog
---
I think the problem is that Camden Park, Wavy Willards and Tyler Fairgrounds are all populated by scorched.  I have seen legendary scorched, but they seem to be 10x less common than legendary ghouls and half as common as legendary super mutants.  I have never seen a starred legendary scorched.
---
I found Alpha solved one Saturday, but the other two were still In Progress.
---
If you don’t want your guns breaking fast as fuck it is 
---
Thank you! That clarifies so much.
---
Run
---
[from a lvl 93]:  I unfortunately can’t think of any other places besides Whitesprings &amp; Watoga that are challenging/fun enough to draw players together.  Personally, I think the Mt Blair excavator is an underutilized spot (I love the mini-quest to power up the excavator).  
---
I'm curious, you mention you were not in a contested workshop, but did you have claim on any workshop?  I ask because I had claim on Gorge Junkyard a few days ago (post patch) and was one shot somewhere in the Divide.  My understanding is that I am open for PVP anywhere on the map if I've claimed a WS and this is why I was killed.
---
Am I misunderstanding WS PVP? 
---
Gunsmith requires it to be equipped to get the decreased degradation. 
---
Weapon artisan allows you to repair to 200% and only needs to be on when repairing. 
---
No offense taken i’m definitely behind when it comes to end game content but I just thought folks would be able to recognize when someone was a “noob” or “first timer” through levels &amp; etc. unfortunately I think they knew &amp; just wanted a mostly finished solo to launch from.
---
What platform are you on? 
---
Please do!
---
If only you weren't homosexual! Darn.
---
I think you get the plans for the PA station when you complete the mission to get excavator armor. I havent done that one yet.
---
 There are PA stations all around.  There are 2 on the 2nd floor of the arkos pharma building.  There is also a PA spawn there. One you clear the building you can close the door behind you so critters cant get in.
---
Cores can be obtained in multiple places.  You can take just the core from a PA spawn. 
---
You can get them from an abandoned but running power plant.  I got most of mine from Poseidon. 
---
The Camden park challenge gave me 2, plus another in the PA inside the roller coaster, plus 2 in an ammo box, and another in the gerearator also located there.  Get the key to the gorge bridge.  Another there.  I thing there is also a PA station there.
---
The safest pa stations are in whitesprings, getting there is the hard part
---
The games are nothing alike.  When FO76 came out it was fundamentally broken.  Lag, disconnects, game breaking bugs, a lot of graphical issues.  Anthem's problem is its boring.  Its a solid game and it looks good but there's no content
---
Yes, kids play this game also. That is often forgotten. Play to win but no need to be rude arsholes.
---
Spoiled food is useful too, as it can be smelted at a chemistry station to craft fertilizer.
---
Unless they changed it, simply opening the transfer menu notifies them that their stuff has been taken. 
---
I’m console lol ;)
---
\+1 I like this.
---
There are two types of tool chests and lockers. It probably unlocked one of the other variants. This is a big reason why a lot of members of the community are wanting picture when you view the plan so you know what it actually creates
---
Xb1 or ps4?
---
Console I understand there’s more grief but I don’t have a good computer.
---
Haven't posted in a while but read your comment and wholeheartedly agree with you. That place is just so immersive. Large too ! So seems like a perfect place to me.
---
LOL.  I've never seen the golf club mods.  The heavy mod is actually pretty cool.
---
Go to lucky hole mine to get 350 lead ore for ~1400 lead ore (with super duper) and make a whole bunch of ammo with it.  Not only is it more useful than carrying around a bunch of scrap steel, it’s a whole lot lighter AND burns through your gunpowder haul.
---
Made 10K 5.56 and ultracite shotgun shells yesterday this way.
---
Poseidon event. You'll need a combat knife, pipe pistol with 200 rounds and 3 or 4 radaway, 2 or 3 rad x and 2 stim packs.
---
Stab everything you can first, no need to waste bullets until you take the security office.
---
Ye honestly the only weapons that look good with a PA are the Minigun, .50 Cal MG, Gatling Laser &amp; Plasma and Auto Grenade Launcher. Even the Gatling looks a bit weird since it's so old style compared to the PA, it would be like having Atomic cars from Fallout in a western film. 
---
Found one whenever I was still playing the game a couple of weeks after release, one shot it with my super sledge and didn’t get anything special lol 
---
Also on behalf of other players big thanks to your positive contribution! 😁
---
Yeah I was surprised too. Before you could shoot the owner before contesting and go wanted. But (since patch) I did full damage without hitting the bench. I wasn't contesting, just inside.
---
Hmm. I'll know more soon.  Asked a few other raiders to check it out. If it's true, shops just became a lot more dangerous once word gets out. 
---
Kinda creepy having someone stalking, forcing interaction. 
---
Go kill something. Leave those kids alone.
---
Number 1: she’s the first boss we have seen.
---
Number 2: not every 150+ player is going to have the same god rolled gear or want to use it. 
---
Number 3: with as many TSE and AAE rolling around she would be seen as a joke. 
---
Correct for what they said. Many plans for item have very similar names and whatnot. 
---
2:  I have been notified before when my camp was attacked. Even got a little miscellaneous quest pop up telling me about it. 
---
After my first run which took forever, I realized its better to just ignore everything except the assaultrons. The turrets are more irritating than anything, I detroy them just for the sound.
---
Dont bother killing the protectrons, in power armor they dont do that much damage, and the more time you spend killing them, the more time youre taking damage.
---
Save your ammo, soak up the damage as best you can, because that part is inevitable
---
To be honest, FO76 is more fun and has more content than Anthem. Anthem has really great fundamentals, but the loot system isn't fun at all, and that's all there is in that game.
---
Xb1
---
Ah gotcha. I was gonna say you could do a run  with us but I'm on ps4.
---
I wouldn’t mind if they nerfed sentinel/assassin, don’t really care though. 
---

You sound as if BGS have fixed nothing since launch. 
---
So, 24 level 150+. Which one of you gets a turret farm at Whitespring and which gets the moonshine shack?
---
I'm still not sure I believe that you could ever break slap damage. Too many people didn't understand some of the PVP mechanics (workshops could put you in PVP anywhere on the map; teammates could put you in PVP anywhere on the map). However, my belief and what I can prove are very different things ;) It's entirely possible there were bugs in the past (or maybe even currently, through a combination of effects) that allowed for it. Without more to go on in current gameplay, I can't test for everything.
---
“Have been” but it doesn’t always happen right?
---
You sir, are amazing. It takes just a few minutes to be kind to another. You could have potentially change the way he views games. You might inspire him to make more friends. This was a good read after a long day. Thank you for your kindness. 
---
I think thats just how they spawn at whitesprings. They dont want low levels just going straight there and power leveling to 50
---
Same for me man. My main group consists of two Swedes, two Romanians, two Dutch and two Slovenians
---
My camp is rarely attacked. Not too many people wanting to start fights with a level 260. 
---
Your builds and weapons must all be trash. Post Video. I've been failed am engineer with a group.
---
What would be even more cool is if all the lights on it worked. 
---
I think it used to like that. I don't get a notification on camp attacks nowdays. And to the op, the junk thing, have no idea why they did that.
---
Started a 2nd character about a week ago and most high level plays (40-90) just took over my workshops and killed me. HOWEVER the other night I was leeching kills at white springs and I meet this dude who invites me to join him and then proceeded to help me level for about three hours. We just talked about whatever was fallout and had a great time. 
---
Today I saw a lvl 7 at Charleston’s fire dept and he started making ugly jokes at me. I made some back and we both laughed a little. I left, he followed me and kept with the verbal abuse but I gave it right back. He then logged off and came back with his lvl 87 and killed me. But he helped me find my loot and didn’t take anything. He also dropped a few plans. I guess it was payment for the harassment lol. It was good times. 
---
You aren't open for PVP, necessarily. But someone can travel to your workshop, initiate contesting it, and then travel to you and be in PVP with you. Or be on a team, initiate contesting your workshop, and then their teammate already next to you becomes in PVP with you and blasts you.
---
This mechanic needs reworking, but it's how it works currently.
---
Right, this isn't the case though. I know what I bought, the 'Tool Chest' Plan that sells for like 680 caps is the large red tool chest. After buying it, it's still not unlocked. All the other tool type chests are unlocked for me.
---
I've tested Reactive Plates. I don't have an effective way of testing reflect-on-block mechanics as the timing is too tricky when I'm trying to run 2 clients myself.
---
Bye Felicia
---
It was a mistake. There's a system in place that allows items to be protected from auto-scrapping.  My guess is they just flagged all those items, but somehow included bulk, which was why bulk wouldn't auto-scrap for a short time. 
---
In their attempt to fix it, now bulk is no longer protected from "scrap all" and they have yet to find a remedy to this issue without reintroducing the auto scrapping of mods.   
---
Yes sometimes u get same server or eggs are bugged but with alittle luck u will get eggs every hop.
---
Lol, if your gear isn't good then you spend too much time at whisperings. You can pick up 3*legendary mobs wavering off the highway in the mire. Try it, by the model home i found 2 and i found 1 president ellas bunker. The last i ran into was over by gulpers lagoon. I ran back to toxic valley ( where i currently reside). 
---
This, mine does 900 damage, I can shoot it at a wall and it’ll bounce and kill a player in no time 1800 if sneaking
---
mh after 10 minutes, he find a new one... strange
---
Great read.
---
If you play on PC, I'll be happy to run some tests with you.  My sniper has TSE and instigating rifles, and my melee has reactive plate and tesla coil mods on his T-51b suit, as well as an anti-armor super sledge and a furious fire axe.
---
Seems like every fix they come out with breaks something ekse, therefore they HAVEN'T fixed anything in my eyes.
---
Battered have springs, no screws.  I don’t believe Charleston area has many if any regular clipboards.  I only find battered.  Non battered are kind of rare.  Occasionally I think I found some in Sugae Grove.

The one with no name?  You take a neg 2 to all specials and gain 3 when in radiation. While in radiation you move X percent faster but can’t use Rad-X, Radaway or radshield

Have my upvote, I really only take workshops for the potential plans from taking and reclaiming them from pve. Ill use them for fast travel points for as long as I have them, but I dont take them for resources, ever

Well the cranberry bog certainly isn't any better. Scorch beasts are worse cause there's generally no cover around.

Just got a 1 star instigating lever action i can fully mod it for u if u buy it.
---
a bigger budget would definitely be nice.  My hope is for a slight increase in build area, too  :) 
---
I know, it's greedy, but i just rebuilt my camp and being able to place "just one more" floor section would have made everything symmetrical.  :)
---
Looking at the metascores, it doesn't seem like Anthem and 76 are much different in the critical view. The real difference is the user score, and I think there's a reason for that.
---
Fallout 4 had a vocal minority that hated on it after release, and those same people were bound to hate 76 for essentially doubling down on what they saw as failed story and removal of RPG depth. Nothing worse than a spurned lover.
---
76 had a vocal minority that hated on it right from announcement due to its MP design, survival elements, and MTX. It had another vocal minority that built up hate in response to the release of information such as 'no NPCs', and the 'heads up' note from Bethesda right before launch that said the game would be a bit of a gongshow. 
---
This meant that by the time  the game was about to release there were plenty of people ready to crap on it, and the launch problems of typical Bethesda jank + multiplayer/server jank were just too much for a lot of others. Consequence was a burst of negativity that gave this sense of objective failure, likely killing a lot of interest in the game and driving away what could have been more moderate opinions. 
---
In the case of Anthem I don't think there was a lot of hyped interest but not really hate either. What I saw was generally disinterest because it was a game-as-service, but in the end I don't think there was the same negative undercurrent slamming into it that 76 had, and no further stumbles like the canvas bag incident to inflate. So in that sense less bias against it, less intolerance for the launch problems, and less reason for clickbait writers to turn the game into a circus.
---
...both...
---
Ah lost so many mods to that bug. It would scrap them when you repaired your weapon I remember. Actually just lost my x01 chassis after a server disconnect. I usually end up picking my x01 first, because it's not painted when I really want my excavator. Then spacebar it back into inventory and get in the excavator. The thing is, the server disconnected me after I got in the excavator and when logged back- was out of the pa and the x01 chassis was gone. They must be smoking crack or we're beta testers or something!
---
It is bugged, it’s not reducing the weight properly and probably never will 
---
" That lamp tho... "
---
I reject the idea that you must have god rolled equipment to beat the boss. That's like saying in order to beat the final boss you have to had beat the final boss. Maybe all 10 players were in trash equipment, highly improbable for a Friday night. Lol. But still, 10 players at a scaled event shouldnt be outscaled. That's illogical.

I can glitch it onto the armor but not consistently
---
There's issues with the power armor. 
---
During a queen fight something caused me to get out of mine instead of loot her. I subsequently died before getting back in. My only respawn option was the vault. Why?  I weighed over 400lb. 
---
All my pieces were now in my inventory for full weight, and no chassis. Eventually it caught up, but not before she turned into a meat pile. 
---
 Got jumped by a 3 star Wendigo in the Mire a couple of days ago. I don't remember what he dropped. ;(
---
Perk system is badly designed. I wish we could put some non combat perks into another category and have them equipped IN ADDITION. to combat perks. Maybe gaining one non combat perk slot per 5 levels past 50. Or make a blueprint system for perk selection so when I’m home crafting I can quickly swap out desires perks for undesired. 
---
The way they do it now is more a gimmick and it’s annoying. 
---
Actually the power assisted turrets make engine sounds like they have combustion engines of themselves to help them move (like the machine-gun turrets do) so if they just make them just make gear sounds when turn from left to right it would be not only accurate, but also less noise pollutant.
---
This is also a complaint that i carried from fallout 4, always horrible to have to listen to my 80000 missile and laser turrets at the castle (witch is my main base)
---
I asked for this a few months ago and it got a few hundred upvotes if I remember correctly. For me it was because my eyes are not what they used to be and playing on a console makes it harder to read from a distance. 
---
I didn't even know the area existed until I had a level 145+ take me under their wing and level me from 35 to 56 in two days. 
---
I'd shoot, run, he'd kill. Success!
---
I have no problem with gear. I enjoy a slow pace play style. So going to find and kill specific mobs has no impact on me. So your words fall on deaf ears. Also gear from the whitesprings can be pretty useful when used correctly. Just because you follow the meta doesn’t mean much. 
---
 I have not used it much but its basically a Stealth Boy field while you are crouched and still.
---
Sounds impossible. I can barely get a server to work for 2 hours lol
---
Just a thought.  When you set power armors down are you placing them or dropping them and climbing in?   Power armor should always be placed, and many people would drop them instead and step inside, but the act of dropping them would cause them to be lost when disconnecting c
---
I know harder to detect does not make you invisible but I'm referring to being sneaky and not being detected. Would you get detected easier with some armor with harder to Detect on it or a chameleon effect? Chameleon being a Major and Harder to Detect being secondary. 
---
Lol. Well we certainly didn't get the queen that just sat there on the ground. 🤣
---
Good idea. I only want plans, not PvP. 
---
Geez.. Yeah never lost a chassis and everything in it before, this is the first time so many something new. This game swear wastes more time to bugs than any other played. I remember buying one of my serums full price way back too, and when drank it- it disappeared after a hour. It was gone. Like 5k or something and I was low level so pretty hard to take back then! Ah well all can do is craft a new set and get the shocks, emergency protocols, hud. I don't know why I like it so much.
---
Personally, I think their loot and gameplay were far better at launch. 76 launched with game breaking bugs, like duping, massively unbalanced weapons, and a loot system worse than Anthems (which Anthem fixed up right quick, patch for it came out yesterday). Anthem's bugs were more system related, like audio glitches and crashes. 
---
FO76 had those in spades as well, but it didn't have well-balanced gameplay to fall back on, which was exacerbated by an immediately irreparably damaged loot economy (which only served to hide more unbalances in the system since TSEs hid the damage gap in ranged vs melee). No part of 76 launched as playable - duping that permanently changed the in-game loot economy, a poor loot system that encouraged it (ghoul slayer gamma or 3* boxing glove, anyone?), a broken PvP system, and crap servers that would cause people to lose hours of work and possibly days of ammo (SBQ).
---
Anthem launched with poor servers, audio glitches, an out of whack difficulty scaling with little reward, and a poorly concieved loot system.
---
*So why didn't it get slammed as hard?*
---
Personally, I find that Anthem's launch, while poor, was magnitudes better than 76's. Fewer bugs, a very well balanced and unique set of classes, and a unique combat system (albeit poorly explained in-game). Anthem has nothing that compares to the shitshow that includes: duping, broken balances (energy vs ballistic vs explosive vs melee), and a PvP system that makes little sense and is easy to abuse.
---
Additionally, nobody had high expections for EA while Bethesda had to date been doing well.
---
But the biggest thing that stands out as why Anthem is getting the benefit of the doubt:
---
The devs talk to the community. On a daily basisn they listen to complaints, they explain their priorities and how they plan to address changes, *and they do it*. 
---
Example: the loot system in Anthem. It was bad, with low drop rates coupled with attributed that were dead (did nothing). What happened? First, drop rates increased with guaranteed Masterworks on GM+ Strongholds. Next, they removed the dead inscriptions and clarified how inscriptions were chosen. Took about a week, and they were crystal clesr with the community the whole way through.
---
Fallout 76 and Bethesda were the polar opposite of this. We almost never heard from the devs. They were obscenely slow and incompetent in patching issues (accidental patch rollback). They didn't communicate with the community (look at when they annnounced Survival mode for an example), and they overall cut off from the community, which only amplified our frustration and guaranteed that they weren't in touch with us as a playerbase (evidence: look at how TSE nerf was implemented).
---
That, IMO, is the #1 reason why Anthem players are more willing to give Bioware the benefit of the doubt than FO76 players will with Bethesda.
---
TL;DR: 
---
&gt;Anthem launched with solid core gameplay and balance to offset its flaws, while FO76 immediately has its economy and PVP broken beyond repair, and no weapon balance in sight. 
---
&gt;People had lower expectations of EA than of BGS. 
---
&gt;Bioware devs interacted with and listened to the community, and were quick to deal with issues; BGS devs alienated and ignored the community and were far less competent in dealing with issues.
---
&gt;(my opinion) Anthem issues were nowhere near as bad as 76's.
---
I am working on this right now for a damage per second calculation. My own full auto pistol is being used as an example. At 53 damage, after sneak attacks, headshots and critical hits, I calculate my gun is dealing 322 damage per shot at 7.2 bullets per second equals 2320 damage per second.
---
I do not have anyone to test this against. It is just going to be entirely theorizing. 
---
I'd actually reccomend the opposite. Once you hit level 50, you're into all the fancy weapons. A level 30 all rise is a great leveler and all my alts used it from 30-50
---
If it has multiple stars and doesn't weigh a million pounds, I'm saving it. Of course, I have no idea how useful any of it will be. Is my three star mutant's Bowie knife really going to help me get a three star Gauss rifle? We'll find out.
---
Anthem is seemingly receiving a lot more mixed opinions then FO76 has gotten from anything that i gathered so far, that or youtube is prioritizing me positive videos about anthem instead of negative, witch is an odd thing for youtube to do imo.
---
then again, i actually never quite cared for anthem, especially after what i've seen from the game combat to be a carbon copy of ME:A
---
furthermore, despite me really enjoying the game (i mean i really do) the amount of new bugs that came with fixes for other stuff and the amount of fuck ups from Bethesda's until patch 5 was just enough to give fallout 76 a lot more negativity then anthem have gotten so far imo.
---
I've got 14 points in Endurance because I hate all the environmental impact that corrodes me while I solo (I'm a long-haul truck driver who mobile hotspots and is never home).  For me, Charisma is my Dump Stat.  The only thing I use it for is the Lone Wanderer perk and Hard Bargain.
---
You mean there's issues with the entire game right?
---
I would so use the gag bang flag gun be it would have to count as unarmed or knuckles maybe and beat someone to death with it 
---
Must try....

8:59 the fissures (probably) time out and reopen lol

when i went there on my 1st character at level 40ish ghouls spawned to my level
---
Plain and simple,
---
Workshop = pvp grounds.
---
Bethesda mentioned it on their update to workshops, that they made the change to encourage more players to engage in PVP for the workshop.
---
Today, 3 solo players and myself spent 2 hours killing eachother at the munition factory. None of us gave two shits about the factory itself. Whoever held it, had to fend off the base until its lost. I don't know them, they don't know me, but we all knew that is where to be for pvp lol. 
---
Players that feel it is griefing are those players that aren't ready to PvP. Once a player feels incapable to retaliate against an attacker, they start to feel it like griefing. like a dude with non legendary weapons getting caught up with sent.assassin 3* and whatever weapon that one shot the dude. 
---
Here we go again
---
I think I have one that is for 3 days
---
The fireproof/dense combo while they're at it.  Explosive weapons already suck. This just makes them nearly unusable. Maybe just have a perk where you can't be hurt by your own explosives and put fireproof back to how it was originally. 
---
I think it can either be chameleon or assassin's.  Plus sentinel as a secondary.  I think those first two are major modifiers.
---
From what IGN and Game Informer are saying it is fundamentally broken. Load screens are frequent and run an average of 8 mins., loot is broken and inconsistent, multiplayer is broken during cut scenes and multiplayer matches don’t sync, and the frequent disconnects. I feel it’s a very even playing field tbh. I have heard lack of content as well and boring after the main story. Graphics of course are beautiful from what I’ve heard...
---
I remember finding a note or holotape waaayyy into sloths
---
the areas are level capped though... like mobs over 16 or something won't spawn in the forest for example. each zone seems to have a cap on the max level mob that will trigger when you spawn in. so if youre in the zone that caps mob level where you are comfy handling it youre gold.  clearly going to watoga at level 12 is a no no zone...unless you like that sorta happy fun times. I can see frustrations at playing in the Savage divide and having level 68s spawn in when youre 20 and that sucks...
---
level doesn't seem to "matter" after 50 unless I'm missing something... a level 50 toon has same number of attribute points as a level 200 toon. they have a larger pool of perk cards to choose from but can only use the same amount at the same time. and they may (rng willing) have "better" gear just before they have more time played. 
---
multi lvl world keeps it dynamic and then no matter the level differences, ideally, friends can quest together.

---
Yeah, I don't see much I want to buy in the shop. Certainly not with real world money. The power armor skins are goofy. They rarely add camp items, which is what I would mainly want. 
---
They do seem to be running a lot of sales now, though. I'm hoping they're trying to clear out people's stock of free atoms because they're about to release some new and better stuff.
---
Correct. Assassin's and Chameleon are both prefix effects meaning they can't be on the same piece together. 
---
Sentinel and Cavalier are both tertiary effects and can't be on the same piece together, and being tertiary can't appear on any piece that isn't a 3*. 
---
They just dropped a loot patch. I never felt it was broke  to begin with. The loading though... Oh. My. God. The story, medioce. It's kind of a boring game to be honest. I wouldn't recommend it. I play it because it is new, and that is it.
---
Dude, thanks for doing shit like that. I'm the kind of pass it forward player and it's really nice to see other people doing it. Had that happen a min ago before I logged off. I usually have major anxiety about using my mic but I saw a guy lower level than me (10, I'm 15) and I'd been playing with that factory or whatever that makes food and set up like 63992 corn around it. Invited him to grab it since I was logging off, took a deep breath and put in my headset to walk him through it.
---
That felt good, man. All the shit I've given this game without being here to actually play it and, you know what, it's already doing me some good. Keep doing cool stuff dude.
---
Got you added! I'm taking a break, but my avatar is sleeping in camp behind the Flatwoods church. Several others are playing now, too.
---
How do you get stalking out of here I have freebies? I have had quite a few higher levels give me plans, weapons, recipies. There is nothing wrong with that .

 Well 3 sneak is basic. Its 75% harder to detect. What that actually means is hard to quantify.

 The Armor effects are more like a Stealth Field.

Yeah, Fireproof/Dense just ruins explosive weapons for pvp, I have a Gauss that does 2477 Damage and can’t one shot someone with it. Somethings wrong.

I once had a lucid dream involving Nick Valentine and myself hanging out at a local bar in my town.

If they wanted us to be able to build neat things they wouldn't force us to use foundations. I think they specifically don't want artistic builds. I have no idea why, but there is no reason to make an even more limited building system than FO4 if they don't want neat builds.  
---
I do it anyway, but it's really frustrating how limiting it is. 
---
+karma
---
Someone told me the Harder to Detect was like adding another point in sneak.
---
How much do you want for the assassin's laser pistol?
---
Not sure if that's sarcasm or not, but I know between fireproof and Emergency Protocols I am pretty much immune from TSEs in PvP. Good thing too, as so many people have them. 
---
I've had a few try to get me with the wanted bait and teammate(s) in the shadows with TSEs. Too bad suckers. I've tagged you with recon sensors so you can't run off and you're barely scratching my paint. 
---
It's two different types of bad.  Fallout 76 is an ambitions project with lofty goals that failed at the basic stuff like "having push to talk", "not crashing", and "using source control".  Anthem is a well polished well animated bag of nothing.  It's easy to point at a glitch in Fallout 76 and laugh, but Anthem holds it together with "shiny explosion pretty" and it's not until later that you realize "wait . . . that's it?"
---
real life karma :'(
---
Yeah, that is worth changing a build. A sneak critical headshot seems to increase your damage by x6. Double damage on top of that is just... disgusting.
---
It's always good to be careful, but I do not think it was staged.
---
Usually, the staging of such a trick would require the low level to have the bounty, which would attract players as an easy target. So it may have been real.
---
Then again, they could be just stupid enough to set it up backwards. The higher level is the bait and the lower level...
---
Ohhh I see the gig! They are trying to push players to attack with drama, the guy with the bounty probably got himself some sent.assassins and wanted to bait other players to fight him. The lower level serves to attract players that get sympathetic and keep seeking revenge.
---
Anyhow, I would have just fast travelled to their location and observed from a distance until i had a better idea before engaging. 
---
It’s not a TSE, just a bloodied explosive.  Picked up a nasty Tesla that’s been doin wonders so far
---
Yeah, im saving some, but I have a feeling im going to be disappointed in how it actually works.
---
Wow! This has been very helpful. Thanks.
---
I think forced foundations is an attempt to restrict how big builds will get, since foundations cost more budget than upper floors. 
---
That said, there are a few ways around it like building from an underwater stairway. That helped me save a lot on foundations!
---
Btw if I kill someone in power armor and they don’t respawn I will completely destroy their PA
---
Yep. I put ultralight on every armor I stash too
---
I think that's been patched. I've had a few teammates try and fail. I tried once with a super high DPS weapon and it didn't do it. 
---
I have broken pieces on a one-shot kill though. No idea what that power attack did, but pip-boy had damage listed around 2200 for a normal swing. 
---
This would actually boost the a quality of the game.

Please!!!!!! Just let me create pre made drop gift bags for the newbs. They have 0 attention span and I just want to give them a care package.

Interesting. I'll have to try again if someone is aggravating the crap out of me. It take a while?  Only time I had it happen to me was with a bobble stacker and a TSE shotgun pre nerf.  Two hits destroyed my entire X01 except the helmet.

I'm sorry. You're actually 100% correct. How, in February, could you know a ban wave was coming! No one did.

How could I be so stupid? It came out of no where. They gave us no indicator bans were coming....
---
Except that one time Bethesda announced, publicly, that they'd be removing the problem players using exploits a fucking month before you took your video. Literally. They told the entire community it was happening.

Fuckwit.

Your proof, your explanation about how your video couldn't have ulterior motives, are about as solid as a bag full of marzipan dildos.

Ground to Air nukes to take out bomber squadrons were also a thing. Look up "Nike Missle" on YouTube. Pretty fascinating stuff with the limited technology they had to work with in the late 60s. Truly amazing how far we've come in such a short time.

Bravo to you, sir!  I think being the wise old sage and powerful benefactor is my favorite aspect of 76, something that single player Fallout titles just didn't offer.  I don't think I go through a day's play session without *at least* leaving a bunch of scrap, plans and ammo for lowbies in the blue suitcases at either Pleasant Valley station or Charleston Station.  Here's today's helpful story.
---
I was doing my normal "wander around whitesprings" today and ran into a couple players around lvl 35-45 that were getting all they could handle in the golf club parking lot.  I built my power armor/melee to swap out a couple perks, change to my secondary axe, a tesla coiled chest piece and act as sort of a "legendary farmer".  The ghouls absolutely hate it and ignore everyone else, so I just ran around grabbing all the aggro, stood and blocked while they picked off the mobs at will.  I think they were confused at first, thinking I was trying to ruin their party, but it became clear after I dropped every legendary I got, plus scrap, ammo and extra stims in the ice chest that I was there to provide tank support.  We continued for a full loop around the place like this, and I got a party invite after we made it all the way back to the pro shop.  
---
As it turns out, these two were brothers playing together in the same apartment, and they had an awful lot of questions about how the hell I was able to just stand there with a dozen ghouls all gunning for me without getting smoked, and I was totally happy to share every detail about my build.  They totally thought I was somehow cheating, but I explained that T-51b offers the best ballistic/conventional DR, plus I had a tesla coil chest mod, three ranks of blocker, a vampire's fire axe with extra blocking resist and a variety of mutations to help me out, including scaly skin and grounded to boost my resists even higher.  If I have it, I'll also eat scorchbeast steak beforehand for the extra 15% damage resist.  Silt bean soup is really easy to get and always good for the +2 endurance.

One of them asked how to get fusion cores quickly, so I showed them that you could claim Poseidon yard (or any other plant workshop) and have it churn out fusion cores, so one of them claimed the shop, we defended it twice and got a bunch of camp plans.  Poseidon was already powered up, but I explained that you'll get a better yield on your workshop extractors if you complete the power up event associated with the plant.  I laughed when he pulled out three full cores after a while and was disappointed.  Those three cores will last for hours with only one rank of power user.
---
I think the riskiest move was to let one of them borrow a [lvl 20 TSE combat rifle](https://imgur.com/7cXTTsp) I'd gotten during a horde event in the mire a couple hours before, because they were asking me all kinds of questions about legendary weapons.  I was trying to explain about the system of tagging enemies, and how explosive ammo is really beneficial for farming legendaries during a nuke drop.  I also talked about automatic tesla rifles, but I didn't have one on hand to loan out, nor could this character craft an auto barrel.  I got a touch nervous when one brother traded the rifle to another in a paper bag so he could play with it, but luckily it didn't disappear.  (explained that too).  
---
It was a great experience for all of us, I think.  (I did get the rifle back, as they promised)  We added each other to friends and I look forward to some more ghoul crushing in the future, or whatever else they want to get into.  It'll be cool to act as tank support when and if they ever want to launch a nuke.  That's a legit tough quest, so we may need to kit up with some anti-armor or troubleshooters weaponry.
---
Two shots from my gauss per piece. My shotgun build runs 1700 damage and it breaks armor. You have to pass a certain damage threshold that s lot of players cannot pass cause they do not have the proper weapons and mutations 
---
Kill her 3-9 times a day with help ranging from 4-10. 
---
OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT IS LIKE THE BEST COMMUNITY EVER!!!!!! add me il make it worth !!!! thanks again im so happy!!!! lol
---
Super sledge will do so, no problem. I figured my buzz blade hitting at almost 900 combined damage per hit would have done it. 
---
Vendor bot at Watoga station has from time to time. 
---
Interesting theorizing, although you won't be getting critical hits on every shot so I'm guessing your math is off there. Were you hoping to test this to see what it would do for slap damage? I'm on PC, I have a willing target.
---
#3 Had one today at Westec and he went off pretty close. Combat Knives have their disadvantages. No problem in an X0-1 with 3 Fireproof. ;)
---
It has to be one hit, and melee can only break legs and arms 
---
I do play on PC, and I'm happy to have you test your weapons on my alt. At this point I don't expect different results, but more testing and third party support is always welcome. IGN Tazier
---
Fully automatic attacks in VATS retain the 100% accuracy bonus as long as you keep the trigger pulled. Based on this, I work under the assumption that all consecutive attacks retain the damage bonus as well.
---
I'll have to try. I've got a bloodied shotgun that should do pretty well as well. 
---
What a nice story.
---
Bad thing about the shorty is the spray of bullets moves their body and it doesn’t work. The gauss shoots one bullet do the body doesn’t move much.
---
So during those 4 hours of grinding at Whitesprings you didn't have to go back to defend the workshop?
---
Every Bethesda game gets hate. When you're the best, you inevitably attract haters. BGS can handle it, though, so don't worry.
---
Interesting. Good supporting circumstantial evidence. Going to be hard to prove with doing that much damage though; to actually verify continuous crit damage you'd have to find a high-health player and find ways to nerf the crap out of your damage.
---
As someone who has benefitted from another players generosity, I too have been paying it forward. I'm level 17 and have randomly messaged players lower than me to offer stuff I don't need. As well as the usual extra recipes and plans.
---
My wife was watching and asked what was going on. I explained with pride about how the community help each other out and so I do the same.
---
I've lost count of helpful players, yet can count on one hand the number of griefers I've encountered.
---
This community is special. 
---
You have to go into notes and learn it
---
No 
---
What even is left to do
---
The thing is I’m not asking for a big buff I’m only asking that they increase the weight limit on the machine from 1 -5 or something like that
---
One other thing, I'm semi-melee focused and right now I'm not using any legendaries, I'm using a fully modded sledgehammer I built to level 45 or 50 that I used the weapon artisan perk to over-repair 160%, raising the damage. Unless you're hunting mirelurk queens and scorchbeasts or trying to punch way above your weight then that'll still do a heck of a lot of damage.
---
Oh, I only use typically 1 foundation, but so far as I know you always have to start your build from the ground up. The entire system is one of the most limiting systems I've ever encountered. After the freedom of FO4 with mods on PC this is like building with both hands behind your back blindfolded. 
---
I'm curious about this waterstair, though. Tell me more, please! 
---
GOOD STUFF!!! This is a great story and I’m glad that there are still nice people in this game. I always try to help and gift lower level players with things that I don’t actively use. Also I have a 10 year old son and I would hope that if he played fallout, he would come by someone like you to help him out! Keep on doing good in the wasteland brother!
---
Yup! I'm saving any 2-3 star legendaries in hopes it might be a randomized exchange system.
---
Isn't that basically what Trapper Armor is? Or am I thinking of Robot Armor?
---
One of those two has decent Radiation Resistance and both are crudely welded metal for the most part.
---
i am on a quest to bomb the most unconventional sites on the map. so if you see driftpoet launch a nuke you will be seeing the wasteland in a brand new way, i guarantee it. 
---
my favorite activity in fo76 is wandering through nuke zones and seeing what changes. the post-blast atmospherics are the prettiest and eeriest i’ve seen in any game. i’m kinda hooked which sucks cause launching a nuke by yourself takes a couple hours from cargobot to launch, all for an hour of picking weird flowers and hoping something totally new spawns. 
---
it’s true, i’ve nuked fissures galore and unless they’re well south of watoga where SBs spawn anyway, none ever appear. 
---
btw the cranberry bog north of the prime fissure seems to generate some interesting throw-downs. i was fighting two glowing diseased mirelurk kings , some sundry scorched warriors and a SB 80 by myself when a level 35 mothman decided he wanted a piece. 
---
that was worth dying for. which i did. several times. 
---
No, he only says Graham when I find him.. Did he have good stuff? 
---
Halloween costumes. Finding the plans for them can take a bit of server hopping, but it's worth it in the long run. The witch costume sells for around 46 caps with hard bargain equipped and the skeleton one is over 50. It only takes cloth and plastic to craft them and they aren't very heavy, meaning you can carry a bunch of them without weighing yourself down, Super easy to max out the vendors this way.
---
Well I do appreciate your honesty. And I have heard the story is.. so so. 
---
Like i appreaciate the tips, but the goal of this post isn’t for me to get good at running silos i probably wont do another for months, the goal is hopefully it gets reworked. So its actually feels rewarding for the effort or its made more fun less tedious
---
https://xboxclips.com/TANAAS/screenshots/c38c40a1-23b3-497d-8547-f3e0e82aa64e
---
Imm not sure if they have lead components but I’m talking about just pure lead, they’re both great but I’’m coming up with ideas of new Armor
---
Sounds like my experience every day. 
---
Again if i really wanted to id do them over and over but for me its not even remotely worth the effort to get good at running silos the rewards are garbage it takes lots of time and recourses, similar to scorch beasts their rewards are garbage. You guys are missing the point of the post.
---
no he didnt't :(
---
Indeed. Ever since the patch, I've been avoiding workshops because I don't feel like watching my back all the time. If I do take one, I just get the reward and then immediately log.
---
Awesome! I'll be off and on all weekend. 
---
Yea there are a ton of QOL drops from FO4, not the least of which is the huge budget disparity, haha.
---
The water thing isn't fancy. You basically just find a lake or whatever that's deep enough to hide most of a metal staircase, then you plop your foundation + stair at the bottom of the lake-- when you place your first upper floor it should be hovering just above the waterline. That way when the build is done it looks like a floating base on the water instead of a huge structure strangely hovering in the air. xD
---
You can do the same thing on land if you can find a broad shelf of earth or rock. Try to find an attached lower area you can drop the foundation+stair on, and ideally your upper floors will be more or less grounded.
---
They're most definitely not being kind. Anthem does have FAR fewer bugs, glitches, technical issues, and server drops, however. 
---
Anthem is being knocked for it's lack of endgame. FO76 was knocked for it's lack of endgame *plus* an **embarrassing** amount of technical problems. 
---
With max hard bargain and grape mentats, I got mine for 9000.
---
Hey, I wouldn't mind joining you. WanderingWolf15, feel free to add me.
---
Yea ive got hundreds of hours in the game tho ive only launched maybe 7 nukes with huge gaps in between simply because its painful and not fun. When i did them it was before the tse nerf so i was a god. And i hated it then now its even worse.
---
Yeah especially thanks for deleting hundreds of post about bans because you all assume Bethesda never make any errors and all those who got banned mudt have been exploiters !     
---
      
---
You guys made a loosy sticky, calling them cheaters &amp; spread the 'I don't care mentality'.       
---
       
---
It should be a huge issue if people got banned for hilarious reasons like '100k ultracite 5mm ammo used over 30 days' or '100k halloween candy farmed within 30 days' but you guys did a good job by deleting 90% of the ban posts...     
---
It's beyond me why a gaming sub would surpress complains just because their mods assume hundreds of people are lying...      
---
Banthesda never even declined that they don't ban for dumb reason, in fact they called 'Halloween Candy' &amp; 'Ammo' you can craft yourself 'rare'. But who cares. It's Banthesda! They're totally fine to ban without giving reasons or answering on tickets. And hey, you're still there so it's impossible that they ban legit players right?      
---
It's not even Banthesda that made me quit. It's the mods here who assume it is totally fine to delete hundreds of claims about shady bans by an automated script which was written by Banthesda. Nothing could have gone wrong, right?     
---
Bye :)
---
Dont thank me :p thank the person who made it
---
Well I can tell you one place that does NOT fill the role: Charleston was the most underwhelming nuke zone ive ever been to. I think I saw 5 enemies total on two different occasions. No flora to speak of. 
---
The physical location would be fine, but there arent enough enemies (which is the main problem of most nuke zones)
---
Maybe an odd idea for a nuke location would be big maw, might be fun to be stuck in a big hole with enemies pouring in.
---
Ive heard morgantown is pretty fun alternative to whitesprings.
---
I would appreciate more camp space. Good incentive to pick up more Atom Store stuff.
---
Ok gotcha, thanks. Another reason I don't claim too many workshops. 
---
Nothing out of the ordinary.
---
Handmade in all terms, my main range char got the most out off it. best recoil even without any recoil mod, big magazine´s, better dmg/dps AND u can farm exp without a big lose of ammo if u hunt super mutants on west tek cause if they high enough they drop 5.56 from assault rifles ;) handmade are THE Endgame rifle for semi and full auto rifle builds IMO :o)
---
One was chilling at my camp a few days ago. Warped away before I could get too close. 
---
I've also encountered two while walking about at night. 
---
Ok thanks 
---
I use Grafton and the Lumberyard as cap, lead and steel sources fairly often. Not farming legendaries, but it has a similar vibe. 
---
People say the handmade is pretty much better in every way.  I think in terms of resources, .45 for the combat rifle slightly easier to craft in bulk than 5.56.  Combat rifle does lower damage than the handmade, and it's reliable as far as accuracy goes, I'd say the two guns are tied for accuracy at least.
---
For some strange reason, the combat rifle has horrendous recoil even when recoil-compensated in semi-automatic fire. All that stuff doesn't seem to affect the semi-automatic fire at all.  It's horrendous, and it makes using a scope borderline impossible because the jump is so large.  Better with reflex sights or iron sights really.
---
But for whatever reason, I know that automatic receivers on the combat rifle with recoil-compensation are FAR more controllable than semi-automatic fire.  Don't ask why, but that's just how it is.  If you're using the gun in automatic, it's somehow easier to manage than when shot successful in semi-automatic.  
---
As for the handmade, it seems as though the handmade's recoil for both semi-automatic, and automatic is very controllable, far more uniform and less jumpy than the combat rifle.  It deals higher damage, and gets access to pretty much exactly the same modifications.  It just uses 5.56 instead of .45
---
It was just forest. 
---
Would you still?  I've got one extra mod, and I could trade a LVL 50 leg with the mod attached.  Probably repaired past 100% too!
---
Ok then yea it’s worth max caps or whatever you want
---
It would be easy to confirm by crafting a level 1 pipe pistol, putting an auto receiver on it and testing the HP lost by a test player for non critical damage, single hit critical damage, and finally two consecutive critical hits. If the 2 consecutive shots are double the damage of a single critical hit, then we have confirmation. 
---
Anecdotally speaking, the size of the 'chunks' of health a scorchbeast or anything that does not die in 2 hits loses during my 12 consecutive hits appears to be roughly the same size. I have the confidence in daring someone to disprove me. Critical vs non critical damage is extremely noticeable when your gun only does 53 damage.
---
I’ve been there a few times, and they don’t drop legendaries in my experience. Shit tons of glowing ones, but it’s just loot. 
---
Yup
---
Wow. Had no idea. Good thing I’ve been collecting one of everything. Thanks. 
---
Yep. Daily. Xbox
---
Not a problem
---
&gt; Fuck. That was a depressing read. But you're not wrong. It would certainly lead to a separate branch of the Brotherhood, but there's no reason they couldn't /wouldn't be reintegrated at some point down the line.
---
That's true too, but since it'll be about 153 years before elements of the Brotherhood move that far east, the Appalachia "branch" will have had all that time to diverge from what was Brotherhood orthodoxy in the 2080s-2090s
---
The differences would be *vast* and well worth exploring if someone wanted to write that story. I think that would be pretty neat, actually.
---
&gt;350 for a table? Thats 5$ Canadian for a digital piece. A small little table. 
---
The Atom Shop prices are insane. I can literally walk ½ a block and buy a real table for that price.
---
They want $18 for a paint job. Most of which are monocolour or look like a 5 year old's fist time using MS paint.
---
For what is on offer, prices should be slashed by 95% across the board.
---
I'd say Morgantown during a nuke had a nice amount of ghouls and fills what players are mostly looking for, but areas like Charleston need a buff to their enemy density to make it worth it. Also Morgantown seems unable to spawn legendaries and so this hurts its viability.
---
Players are looking for areas with either a large amounts of enemies like Whitesprings or areas with individual cells like Watoga as users have already said. But we're also looking for a decent legendary spawns.
---
 The area around West-Tek is also a good example of this, as it has a number of enemies outside and several inside with multiple possible legendary spawns.
---
Also I wanted to thank you for being the intermediary for the community and letting them know our thoughts by linking the thread directly. I know the reddit users of the dev team have to read a lot of flak, but it's appreciated
---
Sadly, same here. This past week the consistently of temporary freezes and full crashes strengthened, tons of random lags spikes happening. Even died a few times to PvE due to it.
---
Someone just wants more turret space to build the floating B-52 flying fortress of their dreams.
---
Sidenote: I'd be cool with this if turrets were hardcapped at a specific number value (e.g., 5, 10, etc.)
---
Soon it will be was and we'll be thinking about the real dlc coming
---
I think I got two or three legendaries last time, but I was mainly there for the flux.
---
But you got the blue pallette swap of hot rod flames just different enough that no one called them out for copy+paste'ing content from FO4... at least not loudly.
---
Ah, so you still need a foundation. Trust me, I've done a lot of camps and tried a lot of tricks, everything still needs that first foundation.  Even the roof trick. You can still do some neat things, but you need a foundation. 
---
My current build is about halfway down the cliff near the Monorail Elevator. I do have 4 foundations floating, with the campfire trick, but only because it's the only thing my Artillery would actually work with. 
---

---
I hear ya. They are tedious, I dont enjoy them either. your reward for this hour long grind: another grind! Enjoy maybe getting a dozen 1* rolling pins and wood armor!
---
Kill him for a 1-star wood left leg.
---
Ya so ive played both alot.  I think fo76 is a better game but the bugs in 76 can actually prevent you from playing.  Anthem has a few bugs but is much more refined.  I have enjoyed the story in anthem better.  The gameplay in anthem is also stronger due to the engine.  However.... 76 has a great world and unique lore.  There is far more content in 76 and much more customizability. So for me i prefer 76 even tho i am playing anthem right now.
---
I find threes more console players as well 
---
Awesome, I added you
---
Yeah you can make both of these lead lined and you get a ton of rad resistance 
---
I was really planning on posting this when I got off work because I've been constantly killed now that you can basically steal workshops just by going in range.
---
This idea is great, either that or make Passives automatically surrender workshops because I don't think you can even deal damage if you're passive and being attacked so like you have no time to react.
---
I'm honestly really fucking tired of being one-shot and looted just because people can do it, I just want to enjoy the game.
---
People were not expecting much from Anthem in the first place, so less impact.
---
Fallout 76 had more hype, therefore had more of a fall.
---
Sure there's reasons 10 level 150+ players can't kill her. They have trash gear/guns. Just because you could scrape together 5/10/20/40 people for a raid in WoW doesn't mean you could actually COMPLETE that raid. 
---
I've watched plenty of high-levels take multiple melee hits to kill ghouls in whitesprings, or expend half a mag of gunfire on a single target, while I'm downing them with a single bullet. There's a MASSIVE variation of potential combat capability based on equipment and perk loadout, as well as skill.
---
Well said dude
---
Make the map more bigger 🐱🐱
---
To be honest...while more areas like WS would be nice...I'd rather see more events like uranium fever.  Events where there are *Guaranteed* legendary enemies that spawn during the event.  At the moment..I only actually know of 2 events that do this (Uranium Fever and Heart of the Swamp, if there are others...I dont have them memorized yet)
---
Killer migraine, hope he feels better soon.
---
So, why offer a waste of resources like a buildable shelf at all?
---
Was thinking this over the past few days...really haven't been seeing the legendaries in the numbers I used to. Glad it isn't just me noticing (well, not *GLAD*)...
---
Hey I would love to join this or start up another branch for the Xbox One
---
Let Go.
---
Agreed. I soloed all the way through...you just have to adjust your gameplay &amp; be more tactical &amp; careful.
---
Same here
---
I’ll hep you launch one sometime my GT ATXlien 
---
Shoot me a message and next time I’m on I’ll see if you want to launch a nuke! 
---
Never thought you could steal someone’s nuke but I guess it makes you all sort of the same quest once you’re in the silo so it makes sense 
---
Reminds me of the Beetlejuice shrunken head guy.
---
Needs a 3rd type.  PvP Death bags.  Basically...PVE kills and suicides should be owned (generate wanted tag for taking if not yours).  Deliberate drops should be open and marked as such.  PvP Kills....should probably also be "open"
---
I did one launch, and yeah it was awful. I think they make it that way to encourage teaming up with other people, but unless you sit outside a silo and are lucky enough to have a group willing to add you, you're pretty much SOL. 
---
PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAASEEEEEEEEEEEE.
---
I don't have a single turret. 
---
Big Bertha has booted me twice as well
---
What system? I'm fine on ps4
---
Took over the ammo plant?  Bad move. It's one of the most hotly contested shops. 
---
I swear every time I take workshops and spend the resources to get them up and going this crap happens, 
---
Xbox
---
You can collect the mainframe cores you break, they weigh nothing, then repair them later for a couple steel and circuits. This lets you skip that part completely cause you already have the cores and don’t have to scrounge for them. I agree with the bullet sponge part tho, but A good troubleshooters weapon would help you a lot I think. 
---
At least you got an email, only some of the people I know who are banned got the first email, and none of them got the second. 3 of which I know irl. And sadly none have heard a peep out of Beth support or on their tickets. 
---
The photo in the store is Preston's Colonial Duster from FO4 XD. What dude got is identical minus the scarf and radio strap, but how many cowboys did you learn about with HAM radios on their dusters?
---
Alright, so I'm playing on a new character because I got tired of my lv 93.  I'm currently Just due north of the clarksburg gun range and on top of a distant hill I saw this thing with glowing purple eyes, as I got closer it dissappeared.  Now I know this isn't the mothman because I've encountered and killed it many times but this is my first time encountering something like this, what do yall think that is?  Is there a new mythical enemy inserted for future DLC's or something?  I honestly thought it was some kind of robot at first I ducked behind a target in the range because I assumed it was going to shoot me.  I pop out and walked slowly towards and then bam, gone.  No smoke like the mothman when he vanishes, just gone out of mid air.  
---
Junk extractors are pretty great for these and gears. I have my camp set up in between one of those and a lead extractor.
---
it wasnt just there, i had one of the griefers just follow me and kept killing me while i was collecting steel at tyler county
---
Yes you can, the greaser jacket, sweater vest, skiing outfit, and space suit I have found in game. Although being able to craft it instead of having it take up 0.1 of my inventory would be beneficial. Also the military uniform is just the cop outfit with the decorative cord added.
---
It has gloves!? Sold.
---
Oh and the clown costume.
---
Sounds fun! I rarely get into epic fights like these. But man are they exciting!
---
I see now. I should’ve specified about it being an Ai not a player lol
---
If they don’t want us filling our camp with turrets, then just limit our turret count and don’t make them count towards budget
---
Mutation that boost ranged damage and decreases melee damage
---
Same boat, you and I
---
That's awesome, way to be a good human being.  Nice to see there's still some left in this wasteland of a world
---
I don't get that either. I use the vault as a free fast travel, and I've had level 1-2 attack me a couple of times. Like, why? There's no way you'll hurt me, and I could squish you. 
---
I've been out for a day now. Rations are gone, guns are broke, and i am irradiated to hell.
---
What is that thing?! I haven't seen one before
---
I'd like weapon skins for all the unstoppables, some green and gold pitchfork for manta man especially 
---
6 servers and finally showed up, but only the 2 clock plans.  Brahmin and 2 eye pts spawned. Killed them then the trader boy showed. 
---
THATS IT! I LITERALLY JUST SAW THIS 5 minutes ago and was like what the hell is that?  It dissappeared on me considering I'm on a new character only level 11.  Wish I was on my 93 so I could see what he/she drops.  Its 2019, can't assume a gender anymore, even if its a mythical flatwoods monster. lol
---
In the same vein, garage door needs all the skins as options too.
---
Im almost always in a filled lobby (xb1) unless it's like 7am and then it's like 15 people. 
---
I can vouch there is a Super Sloth in the game, I found one up in the Northeast corner of the map.  Dropped a ton of loot too multiple legendaries
---
I read this like a terminal entry of some pre war test. 
---
ITT: Everyone forgetting launch of every Bethesda game. 
---
I love this game.
---
Heya, sorry to bother you u/LadyDevann but do you think you could pass this to the Dev team please? I've been killed a lot more since the changes to the workshop and it's made  workshops a lot less viable due to people actively targeting those who don't want to fight now, especially since they can basically go to the far reaches of a workshop and claim it, and if you so much as try to fight back or just look their way they can one shot you.
---
this is one of the purest posts i’ve seen about f76. i go around helping lower level players too, giving out spare power armour pieces that are low level along with paks/weapons/and purified water. it’s one of the best feelings you can have
---
Your first point hasnt been contested.  May I see?
---
I came back the other day and finally decided to build a house. Some destroyed my shit while I was in passive mode and one shotted me in power armor 700 def. Fuck this game and it's broken weapons and PvP
---
I do agree on this, in my opinion the benchmark for the effectiveness of a weapon should be it's non-legendary level 50 fully modded variant. Legendaries are now the expectation not the exception, kinda takes away from them being *legendary* when they're completely necessary to even play the game
---
NP your welcome!
---
Nice write up. Level up yet?
---
No way anyone takes more than one punch to kill a whitespring ghoul, I have a terrible build and even I can do that
---
I cant do it consistently so I can onky give tips that might help.
---
I can only glitch thr claw on by wearing the claw first before stepping into the armor.
---
It seems I have more success glitching it on when the servers are laggy.
---
Theres an increased chance of it happening when I wear 2 pieces that are stacked/identical for example, I can double wear clean steel workers outfit x2. I havent tested other outfits.
---
Some other player put it there
---
Damn, this changes everything 
---
If you have some spare caps and come across an unclaimed workshop it's worth claiming it.
---
Each one you claim and defend gives rewards, often plans so it works out cheeper than buying them.
---
Plus it gives you a free fast travel point.
---
I helped a lvl 2 bingo bongo lvlup to lvl 5 by crafting lvl 1 and lvl 5 leather armor and weapons escorting them around junkyard, mama dolces, the airport. Then they said theyre lvl1xx on an alt and do I have any explosive shotguns. Waste of my time
---
Dude people beat it all the time with regular weapons and practice. Stop acting like your lack of teamwork and skill is Bethesdas fault. 4 gunners and 6 melee and shes dead in 10 minutes. Use ultracite gatling lasers if you dont have anything better. And all rises for melee.
---
Dont know why you're getting downvoted, shes not hard to kill. With semi decent participation. I dont complain to NAPA because my dog did a shit job of changing my oil. 
---
What's with all the cheaters that don't lose any health when you shoot them at all not even a tiny bit yet Two Shots from them will take all of your health just had my base and Camp rated
---
If low level characters are in high level areas I mean, run? Otherwise pop a bullet in stuff and let the high level character kill everything and reap the benefits. 
---
The nukes should spawn extra mobs, ontop of what it currently does. Maybe like waves of glowing ones, So everywhere is worth nuking.
---
u are right fans have screws and they are at that building
---
PC not a single crash all week 🤗 never happened to me before i was used to couple crashes per day, but now after patch 6 miracle happened. 😁
---
Take a workshop only if you want to be killed or you have op pvp gear and you want to test if it will help you.
---
The workshop thing is probably a huge one. It's not very clear that you can get attacked miles away from a triggered take over.
---
That's gotta be it. I mean, think of all the assets from fallout 4 that are nowhere to been seen. I mean they'd basically be free for bethesda to add in. Its a choice theyve made to give us a drip feed of garbage. Its gotta be some monetization strategy to get us to think "ok, most of this shit sucks, so I'll buy anything decent with these free atoms," then when you're out, they realease the good stuff.
---
Gamma gun is typeless. It's only Energy and Ranged.
---
Give this rep a raise. 
---
Communism wouldn't even work post apocalypse tho...
---
Caring in- and offgame, nice!
---
Sounds like something a capitalist would say. 
---
I agree with you there hence I'm not a communist.
---
But creating player factions is the goal here.
---
And the system I've devised is outlined in a post on the subreddit.
---
While I love both games. I will say 76 was even less polished than Anthem was at release. So it makes sense Anthem isn't getting as much hate.
---
I also have the 8 code pieces and the nuclear key card now. Do I have to do sth in whitebunker to decrypt for the launch code or can I just head to the silos? In whitebunker I dont get the reason for the code fragments on the wall (Silo A) and the code printer. 
---
Came here to say this. In Kentucky. 5 crashes tonight. Really frustrating. I have DSL but I don’t think it’s the connection. I haven’t had a crash in a month. 
---
PC that can run this fo76 smoothly is much more expensive then console, that's probably why.
---
This is what makes fallout great, the random in-fights
---
It's probably just some undropped/left over Super Mutant modifier tag in the creation kit applying the legendary buff when Graham first spawns in the world.
---
Good for levels but not good enough for legendarys 
---
Durability is calculated per projectile that hits, more projectiles more loss 
---
Terrible system
---
Whenever you help a kid and make their day, you’re making the world a whole lot better for us all in the long run.
---
Oh really? I've pretty new to the series. I'm charisma/gunslinger; what does "Ranged" mean simply non-melee?
---
i haven't tested what kind of perks affect the ammo and i've never gotten the Plans. I have Science/Expert but not Master. Do you know if that effects crafting one? Batteries included works on gamma gun rounds than? 
---
I've only gotten a singular 2Star Gamma gun my entire team playing with a team funneling me weapons and it dropped through the ground when I tried to give it to a teammate to mod. No idea what enemy or location drops it. 
---
I have the targeting HUD on my Excavator PA, and it appears that the targeting effect is server wide. 
---
You lost me at juiceman 
---
Anthem getting a break?  Everything I've seen is showing Anthem getting completely shit on.
---
Long loading times, ridiculous number of loading screens.  Forcing players to stay close to each other.  3 mission types.  Looking *NOTHING* like the pre-release promotional material.  It being completely obvious how much and where they cut finished content out with the intent to sell it back.  That ridiculous spreadsheet to figure out what part of the game you get.  Releasing the game to one group - and then claiming that two weeks later (in the general release) is when they'll push a 'day one patch'.  Bitch, its already day 14.  It was a, literal, MVP.
---
That's on top of a '90 day roadmap' - a fucking 90 day roadmap to when they'll actually finish the fucking game.
---
And you know what?  FO76 still released in a worse state.  That's the sorry fact that people need to accept.  FO76 was a worse game at release and wasn't even minimal viable product at release.  
---
There is a long process to get the code. You need 8 codes from the scorched officers for a silo. The keyword from the Whitesprings bunker. And to be good at scrabble. Or go to https://nukacrypt.com/solved for the launch code. There you will also find a detailed explanation on how to solve the launch code.
---
More like axe em. Bethesda should stop trying to make light of their fraudulent business practices; it's no secret that their licensed products **ABSOLUTELY** have gone down in make/quality over the years. You can especially tell whenever they re-release items like this one: https://gear.bethesda.net/products/enclave-hoodie
---
The re-release has noticeably less volume/definition to it compared to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/2qbx06/for_christmas_for_the_enclave/
---
I would guess it's easiest for a high level to be shot by another high level while their teammates are contesting a workshop and thinking he died to some other slap damage allowing him to be oneshot bug rather than intended game mechanics.
---
or it was just me.
---
Whatever fuck the customer. 
---
Lol...he’s a YouTube video maker...one of the few invited to the pre BETA party Beth threw at the real Whitesprings Resort. 
---
I can not stress this enough for level 20's looking to level up quick: go to white springs. Yeah, you'll probably die a few times before you master it, but once you do? You'll be a level 50 in no time. For those new players,  
---
1. Take some Rad-X, trust me, you'll need it
---
2. Buff up with whatever chems suits the build of your character (strength for melees, perception for shooters)
---
3. Fast travel to white springs
---
4. Shoot a few rounds into the building
---
5. RUN!
---
6. Get to a ledge where they can't get you. The wall by the pool is fantastic
---
7. Manage killing them, keeping your health up until they're all dead
---
8. When they're all dead? Collect your loot and enjoy the EXP
---
No problem.
---
TBH, that's all the workshops are good for now, there's no real incentive to take one other than farming them for XP. 
---
No, see you can move stuff using a container on a server. Suitcase, overseer cache, corpse. Some containers will become full others seem to allow an endless input. 
---
The biggest challenge with that is that you need to join the same server via a player on your in game friend list. So many people prefer to just get the stuff picked up by their friend to ensure it’s safe till they can collect it with the 2nd character. 
---
My build ended up kinda weird for that same reason, 11, 5, 10, 3, 3, 10, 13
---
Very creative!
---
And? That gives him credibility? Who's he Ted Koppel? He's just a click bait YouTube personality.
---
I did not know Bethesda had a 'gear' store.
---
What the fuck is wrong with these people?
---
I started to save everyone I picked up but then I realized I can get plenty of legendaries in may when the vendor comes out. I do still save all 2 and 3 stars tho because they are still rare for me, I barely got my first 3 star today.
---
Haha, yes that even, I can't even blame the auto correct for that 😳
---
With the stash at 800 and the fact that I have a ton of weight reduction means I’ve been hoarding every piece f legendary till he comes out, I wonder how it will work exactly
---
Not surprisingly this still isn't fixed. 
---
Good link .. thanks!
---
Yes to everything u say, the realy big downside is that u have to buy a plan for it and craft them to unlock the mods because of the rare droprate for the weapon
---
Oh now I feel stupid... I very rarely use that word let alone spell it out 😉
---
Doesn’t give him credibility at all...he made a video in which he wondered why the first DLC was a new crafting table, got me thinking and hey presto here is my post.  If you notice the post isn’t about a YouTube personality, it’s about what’s been going on in the game and my (equally lacking in credibility) opinions...unless I’m mistaken that’s the point of Reddit.
---
Good thing it's not war, because war, war never changes. 
---
Yes a thougt about something like that but i would say that 3 Slugger 2 Expert Slugger and 1 Master Slugger to get the 75% armor Pen perk is MORE worth then 15% over all extrea dmg IMO
---
Umm morrowind?
---
Turrets might be because someone hacked them maybe
---
Also, one of the coolest things in Fallou4 was to have them power armors at home on display and tune em bit by bit to the max. I am really missing this end game feature in F76. 
---
The player had that very same day achieved the Good Grief trophy (I had a peak), but I didn't want to feel as though I was being over sensitive about the ordeal. I was a little more annoyed that the player was using the cover of the workshops to target me though. 
---
Someone did a video showing all the math behind raw damage vs Armor penetration and raw damage wins every time, but if that’s your preference I respect it 
---
My proposed solution to this was a container we Can deploy into their camp or somewhere that marks it on their map as an objective. Wasteland themed replacement for mailing cuz we gotta do it ourself and transmit the loc via pip boy uplink. 
---
All kinds of great containers could solve every interaction prob the game has right now because drop bag and death bag are really unfinished ideas
---
All of the issues were made up and this game always was and is flawless. 
---
Excellent and thorough work. Could you check whether fall damage is also capped in pvp? Say I someone send someone flying over a cliff. 
---
I agree with you there, He is 100% click bait.
---
 I feel like its because of Youtubers such as Juice head that have given Fallout 76 the bad rep it has now. 
---
Could always do my exact build and take out blocker and put in inscisor to have both! 
---
I want the radius of camps to be increased, I can manage the budget, but I really wish the radius was bigger, and it was easier to see the boundary.  There should be a way to preview the zone you'd be able to build so you don't choose a spot, and then it turns out it's impossible to build there because certain trees don't get demolished, and the terrain refuses to play nice with your camp blueprint.
---
I literally only ever take a workshop if it's the first time (for that challenge) or if it's for a daily or weekly.
---
I have *zero* interest in PvP and the resources and rewards from holding one are useless compared to the pain in the ass that is players trying to take it and the constant defense mission.
---
Ahh, that makes sense. Thank you
---
eh, bad luck i guess, i run laser gats and jetpack and tend to float about 86 cores. There's always watoga farming. 5 cores there just from PA suits and a couple of places they spawn fairly often on the side. 
---
I’ve seen it once before. He was 3 star for me as well. Graham is the man
---
100% agree and he for money above all which is just sad. 
---
Wow men are so evil smh
---
Happened to me too. I dunno, man, it's just a bug. 
---
If you play on a pc my ign is the same as here. It is fun running through silos with new and seasoned players. 
---
I am but a humble level 36, but I wish to be part of such an illustrious cause that is greater than myself and do my part in providing a better life and future for my fellow man and woman! All around I see desolation and a struggle for survival and meaning in a wild west wasteland filled with the ghosts and remnants of the failure and suffering the old way of the West brought. Perhaps a glorious future for us all may be found under the banner of the Red and Gold Star!
---
I actually go out and seek out low-level players. Even though I had about 900 hours into FO4, I know what it feels like to not know your way around. I try to keep a hunting rifle and some ammo on me just to give it away. Quite a few I run across though seem to have been here before and don't want anything to do with me. Or maybe it's the X-01 PA and big guns that scare them off. No worries though, I'm a nice guy.
---
Think it's 200 per hour so check it regularly. I haven't really gone for that workshop since the workshop nerf. 
---
I agree, however golf course bases should Not be allowed, regardless of turrets or not. 
---
I've seen it few times, in about 600 hours. Fairly rare yeah. I think it's connected to region or particular enemies. Or if not connected, then different chances from different things.
---
A pistol shotgun yeah.
---
I can guarantee that. It's THE most satisfying experience. As a person I like being thanked general irl for helping out people (solving PC problems at work) so for me is kinda double the experience. Its amazing.
---
Hmm, the machine has a storage limit of 1 pound so that means different ammo will fill it quicker? I'm not sure either 😂
---
I give out plan at train stations when i have some time over! 
---
I wish I had that help 
---
What platform? Are you looking for something specific? I have a few pieces
---
https://youtu.be/Wjru8gDylwk
---
Dude I had claimed a workshop (I’m level 30 and I quest I wanted to complete over there) and these level 100s came over and claimed it and then instantly killed me like 8 times when I came nearby to try and do my quest. So fucking aggravating, like pick on somebody your own size. I had 0 chance against them. 
---
If your in the NE roughly the New England area we are getting snow and that could have hindered the game server. 
---
Goes by 'SneakySniper'.
---
Wants a server with lots of players.
---
"Social Interactions"... *wink wink nudge nudge* say no more, say no more
---
They get away with scamming and make jokes about it. Fuck em. 
---
I also got anthem for having origins sub service so it’s basically free for me, and it ran flawlessly for me at least even up till now.  76 keeps wanting to kill itself whenever I play.  I think those are the differences, ones still infested with bugs, ones... infested much less
---
So damage is based on targets hit?
---
Like if I had a Fatman/missile with a quad mod it would be even weaker?
---
Instigating explosive lever should be better. Also better rate of fire. 
---
Someone with such dedication to the cause must obviously be given a high position in the party, please privately message me to decide what role you will take on!
---
ACTUALLY YOUTUBER BAD! 
---
Yep pretty much. I recall it shoots several pellets, of course consuming just one .50 ball. It has really low range, much less than any bad shotgun.
---
I've been wanting a budget increase since about 2 weeks after launch. hopefully with all the new camp items they are planning it's going to happen. 
---
Each projectile that hits it's target reduces durability, it has nothing to do with damage dealt 
---
That’s awesome of you. 
---
Something like that would totally make my day
---
Haha I suspect THAT isn’t limited. I’m pretty sure that video the guy just posted of his trade-trap on the cliff edge resulted in deaths. But I can test it, and honestly it’s such a limited scenario (it ain’t easy to send someone flying) that I have no issue with it not falling under slap damage, 
---
Tested and results posted. Still slap-capped. 
---
This! Always felt strange that they didn't implement it in the first place and made a decision to just convert the existing spawns to higher level glowing ones. Nuke zones supposed to be the endgame content so let us fight glowing hordes in every nuke zone, for Todd's sake!
---
Normally for me it's just easier to take Grafton steel or just farm super mutants for gun powder and scrap their weapons for steel. 
---
Haha I'm just kidding. But yeah I suspect the same. 
---
I would think it's affected by pistol damage perk, but then it could also be affected by shotgun spread and possibly both damage perks. Few weapons incorrectly take two perks like bolt-lock rifle and meat hook.
---
Hell yeah finally can get rid of all my extra plans for something new. 
---
You would recommend instigating explosive over a regular instigating any time? Also lever vs hunting you’d go for lever?
---
What lol
---
The best way to look at it. Is that somewhere out there a lvl 20-30 player would see you and wonder: how is this humanly possible. 
---
I used to see people talk about mutations and I admired the idea but always felt that’s a bit complex to manage and nah I’m not gonna be interested. Today I have around ten of them :)
---
Also always wondered about those with thousands of dmg on their all rise. Recently I observed mine reaching over 900. 
---
That’s the way of life after all. 
---
You are correct. The hunting rifle has the better base damage but the lever has the win in fire rate. Effects aside of course. The IE lever wins. 
---
Nothing wrong with that. If it were desirable enough people could farm them.
---
Yes. You get two legendary effects. Also, in this instance, the hunting rifle has a lot of recoil. 
---
Black bowder weapons don't have any mods to learn. 
---
Most weapons you can judge with weapon workbench. If you can't see, for a gun for example, that it has standard or whatever receiver, then it doesn't have any receivers. Several melee weapons are also like that, not moddable at all.
---
I found the game hangs when killing multiple mobs in really quick times that the first one obviously gets its loot generated first and sometimes still gens when moving through the others. 9/10 times I’ll go find the first thing I downed to fix it. 
---
Possibly sold by vendor too. Or the one I saw at level 150 could have been sold by player too, thought it was stock.
---
Same! During the mothman week I saw him constantly. My camp is set up near where you are too! 
---
Sick story man:) 
---
Fuck, I wish Bethesda replied to people like this more often 
---
I was thinking about this  recently. I take workshops for the resources and defend events. Not interested in PvP. I also leave all stuff unlocked so other players can help themselves (there's only so many fusion cores I can carry). Being able to hand them over on request would be a bonus.
---
I did a Queen fight yesterday and I got loot. Idk. She’s buggy when she wants to be so you’ll have to roll the dice and take your chance tbh. 
---
Science!!!
---
i can guarantee it will never be fixed.
---
Agreed! Except when they get greedy. Then I got to set boundaries. 
---
I clocked my bloodied powerfist at 1722 today, my jaw dropped. 5166 if I'm going ninja, madness lol
---
This has been my experience in a number of online games in the past and my history is long, Asheron's Call and EVE especially jump to mind. 
---
With the bugs and features of 76, I am at the end of my patience though and being grieved by players so much is actually one of the contributing factors to why I will put the game down. 
---
So, thanks for doing this. An online game is built on its community and if you are willing to follow this road, then despite the developers, you can make it a cool experience for all the folks out there and they will pass it on. 
---
That kid will now hopefully always remember that 76 session as one of the positive highlights that shaped his gaming future. 
---
dude fuck yeah. ad victoriam!
---
Yeah i think so, my gf played Anthem and she got bored after two nights of playing.
---
Not because of the serious performance issues and many bugs, which were less severe than Fallout 76 but still bad. The truth is that the core gameplay is just incredibly boring.
---
Despite it's technical flaws Fallout 76 has a very fun gameplay loop. Explore through a post-apocalyptic world, scrounging weapons, junk, food and water. Use that to mod your weapons, armor or build your personal base.
---
Anthem, is just the same few things over and over. Very handholdy, the game just sends you following a specific path to a location to kill some enemies or interact with some things, then repeat that a few times and mission complete. At some point they were just throwing challenges just to pad out the mission length, where you had to find chests or kill X enemies with melee. Which didn't even share in a group!
---
Performance of Anthem was better, but gameplay wise Fallout 76 was much better. Anthem is a barebones experience.
---
If i’m A good aim. Would the better base dmg on a IE hunting rifle be better than someone using a lever action with not a good aim? Headshot one after the other?
---
Tbh I’d like to see proper 4-5 star gear to be released with new bosses like the queen. My only hope is the new legendary vendor doesn’t remove or reduce the grind. 
---
As for the new crafting. I sense a play on the basics of survival: shelter, water, food, medicine, weapons, etc... Maybe reading into it too much. But it’s an idea. 
---
And energy weapons do need a hug. I don’t think I’ve seen anyone running a laser rifle or pistol.  Which is sad, they can do really good so work before breaking. 
---
A level 200 friend
---
mmm here we go. Maybe I should explore my options with sneak attacks and ninja. 
---
Fallout is an existing IP with long time fans. Anthem is some random thing about iron man suits. They both made the same mistakes, except Fallout has waaaay higher expectations.
---
When she regenerates her health she takes off again. Don't worry, it's working.
---
Nah.... Anthem is getting its fair share of criticism and critique articles and plain old bashing because its trendy to hate (the irrational and ragey kind or the very specific politically motivated kind for the content these companies make) on BioWare and EA now. The clicks and views skyrocket like chum in the waters. 
---
There's plenty to criticize and call out about EA as a business and the practices, but I do get tired when I see many act like they're 9th level hell satan and the only ones that did (or tried doing) loot boxes and microtransaction scummy business practices. This entire industry is now built on those models and have been for over ten years, with countless companies on mobile and facebook doing the most predatory imaginable still today. Your fave Rockstar, Blizzard, CD Projekt Red, and all ain't clean and pristine either.  Again, in short theres whole large industry problems to tackle. But nah Anthem isn't getting any breaks over 76. 
---
Thanks goodnes. And here i was actually expecting to be burned at the stake for being a Thread-necromancer. Is that even a thing on reddit ? Im still rather newish here XD
---
Glad i was able to help though
---
Yes in theory. But the lever just comes out on top with the fire rate. The hunting rifle just means that if you have to get the one hit head shot. You also have to factor in the weight of the ammo. .308 standard for the hunting and .45 for the lever. How much ammo are you trying to use per kill. 
---
And do you get 5 separate characters on each console? 
---
A heart warming story..People remember the good guys a lot longer than idiots..
---
3) almost every time I spawn at West-Tec to clean it of mutants there’s 1 suicider
---
You can keep leveling up and move special points around or pick new perk cards. You can’t have more perkcards equipped, but you can swap them around. 
---
I swap around perk cards before crafting and entering nuke zones for example. 
---
This is kinda risky, because if you dump everything in a container and then a server goes down you'll lose everything. It'd be way safer to have a friend hold your stuff. 
---
At each new level over 50 you can move a perk from one SPECIAL into another. It's time consuming if you really don't have it how you like, but it might be easier than starting over. 
---
Ah, the ole' gauntlet. Raider-y good times.
---
I agree 100%.  Forgive a dated reference but the Legendary Vendor kinda reminds me of Horadram’s (?) Cube in Diablo II (probably misremembering it’s actual name but those who played D2 will get what I mean).  
---
For about 48 hours after patch 6 I was running into 3* cryptids, two in a row (if you count the Mirelurk Queen) in successive Heart of the Swamp events.  Was hoping to run into more 3* Grafton Monsters but haven’t seen any since.  (Not saying there weren’t any before but I’d never seen a legendary cryptid before then).  I’d love to have more of that around.
---
After seeing how toxic some players are and the negative comments on places like Facebook..... this is an amazing story. Maybe I will let my 5 year old try :) 
---
And at level 50, leveling up enough to respec isn't too big of an ask. 
---
Shhh!  The bloodied buzz blade needs to be kept a secret or it'll be duped ad infinitum, then nerfed. 
---
I prefer this method too.
---
Said that it would be more efficient in terms of exp/h and ammo/h to have the ammo factory, Grafton Steel AND going around killing supermutants if it wasn't for PvP which more often than not results in a waste of time and a net loss.
---
So I stick to supermutants because taking over the ammo factory is like writing in neon letters 'I want to PvP, come at me bro.'
---
Of course they do, they have shirts cups and stuff just like every other company on earth. 
---
😂😂😂😂 very true 
---
Yah I love him so much.... and he just makes me miss living NPCs all that more. How lonely and cold it feels.
---
I used to do launches with my friend and they went pretty okay. Now I can do it solo with my All Rise. I never use guns in this game for high level enemies but that’s because I don’t have those 3* ones. I only use my 2* for SBQ. But other than that I’ve done 2 solo runs and it was pretty nice and easy. Jack terminals and turn the turrets off or make them fight agains the robots in the room and then deactivate and go in. That’s how I do it and I barely use any healing. (Bc I’m in PA) I get everyone has a certain build. I play the game how I want and I don’t make myself be one “build” it’s uncomfortable to me. 
---
Say 2 each kill with IE straight through a super mutant’s head. There’ll be 2 dead before the first one even hits the ground :p besides i’m Only a PvE player and don’t carry anything else with me except armor, a sniper weapon and ammo. Some food and drinks.
---
Another tip too, if a creature ever falls through the ground, sometimes it can fall in another part of the area. A few days ago I was in the mire, and me and my friend killed a legendary gulper. He fell through the ground before I could loot him, but looking up and behind my friend, I saw the corpse fall from the sky and to the ground about 20m away. 
---
Put a nuke a little to the west of in between hemlock holes and the waterslide, I got &gt; 200 violet flux. Make sure you have other ingredients first though because that's literally all there is.
---
Kanai’s cube? I just hope the vendor isn’t set up so that one could spend all day and get over 20+ 1-3 star items and just recycle them. Maybe adding an internal timer to prevent spam would be nice. 
---
And I know what you mean on that. I rarely see them. And when I do it’s mostly wendigo and the odd Grafton. 
---
&gt;so how about in adventure mode instead of contesting immediate flagging for PvP the owner gets a dialog box with "Fight for your workshop or surrender"
---
Wat? Why? Mostly no one wants to fight for workshop.
---
&gt; Choosing surrender relinquishes control of the workshop to the attacker, attackers can no longer tease workshops to kill anyone more than once or force server hops.
---
So you don't even want what you suggest? Instead you are trying to want a sollution to another problem.
---
Choose.
---
Waking up to see this as the first post I saw this morning. Way to go OP.
---
This this this!!!!
---
The ammo varies on the type. It cranks out about 5x10mm and 5x5.56 about every 10 seconds or so, or something like that.. But for .50cal it pumps them out one at a time, with a weight limit of 1lb over the whole machine, I believe. It's 1 or 2lbs. But I think for 5.56, it stacked up to 200 (or 300, I wasn't paying too much attention), before it I grabbed it out, which at that point, it might have maxed out in it's weight. 
---
&gt; You kill the owner during the contesting, 
---
Which many times is just one good shot. Yeah sure make a bad system worse. PvP fights are short. If you want it, it should require more than just one kill.
---
Okay this is it. I read it everywhere. I want to know. What is PSA!? 
---
Thank you all for the advice!
---
thats epic! 
---
Agreed. Someone clearly wasn't careful enough. Every other business that designs/manufactures things has a QA department. Where's the quality assurance? Like I previously stated, maybe they should have a test server just to test their patches before putting them out. Perhaps even one that players can hop on and tell them about any issues before they're live. Wouldn't that help eliminate these kinds of problems? 🤔
---
The machine can store 1 lb and 200 5.56 rounds :)
---
Thank you, my group is the one who usually handles the machine.. I'm just the heavy guns gal. 
---
Ah :'D
---
The lever still wins. Even though it’s less damage per shot the fire rate beats the hunting. But it’s really just play style. I enjoy the lever more than the hunting. But I still respect the hunting for the shear damage. 
---
I’ve always assumed with the instigating effect that if the explosive damage hit another mob that would cancel the instigating effect as they aren’t full health? Which would make the next shot not as powerful.
---
I got mine from Phoenix in Watoga. And a mod from the train station 
---
Hmm I'm doubtful. The word would be out already.
---
I applaud you, thank you for doing that :) 
---
Maybe just a scrapping aspect that can only apply to the 4th star perhaps.  Scrap an instigating item and have a 1% chance to obtain an “essence of instigation” or if it’s a three star 1% divided by 3 so could be weight reduction, could be swing speed, etc etc...then have to combine say 10 essences of instigation with hard to find items in order to make a mod like the sacrificial blade...just spitballing but you see where I’m going.
---
Damage ain't shit.
---
Claim or not claim? On your prior post, which btw you can edit, you said they just shoot you.
---
Are you now saying they are initiating the contest on the workshop, AND then shooting you? Because obviously that's how it should work now.
---
I review the crashes and the only crashes I get are bear the Charleston power plant. The video shows some sort of graphical error before giving up.
---
I do. I can see as a closed auction house. It sells base inventory weapons and armour. But can recycle and give you things that others have given it. 
---
Like if I give it a double anti armour lever action and you give it a poisoners 10mm smg I can have a chance at getting that or something another player put in.

Lots of companies (not just game companies) have stores that sell branded merchandise, Ubisoft has a store like this, Microsoft has a gear store, some companies people work at might have a gear store 
---
I've seen the armors around the through vendors but personally I've only seen the wetsuit plan in random spawns 
---
Yea that’s a good idea...we need more mechanisms that encourage community 
---
Public Service Announcement
---
...Im a low level player lol
---
So a big problem mentioned often is there are only two good places to Nuke. 3 with Morgantown with ghouls spawned in.
---
A couple of fixes I have seen mentioned before are:
---
1. Nuke Zones should have their own spawning and continual respawns so all nukes are valuable no matter where you nuke. Nuking new areas makes a nuke zone feel fresh.
---
2. Nuking non ghouls need to be buffed in terms of do/loot. The only reason whitesprings and ghouls are popular is because of the loot/XP payoff is the highest. Buff all other enemy loot table and xp to match. This makes it more enjoyable to have more things to kill without feeling like your wasting bullets and supplies.
---
3. More boss fights. I watched a YouTube video where a behemoth was nuked. That a extremely disappointing and underwhelming fight.
---
4.Non Nuke Zones- There should be more high level areas with lots of enemies and lots of loot added into the game. There just really are only a couple of places for end game reward systems. 
---
I figured editing and tagging wouldn't actually tag LadyDevann which is why I made the second comment, not several btw. I've had many instances of these issues though. There's been times where before this was a thing I've been one slap killed by exploiters, there's been times where people have shot me and not killed me and as a passive I couldn't do anything about it, and then theres where someone stormed my workshop and killed me in one shot my contesting. It's not a singular instance.
---
Tactics and Brotherhood of Steel... We do not speak of these. Lol. Although the Midwest Power Armor from Tactics did look kinda cool. Even though the Advanced Power Armor Mk. II (Enclave Power Armor from FO3) looked similar in some ways. Especially the helmet
---
I also want to launch a nuke but i need help and i'm in EU
---
I just want to be able to highlight an entire structure and move it all together.
---
They’re aren’t going to reply they could care less you already paid them they’re money even though the game wasn’t ready to be released 
---
So let me get this straight so I don't feel stupid. 
---
The Queen was bugged becasue EVERYTHING was bugged.
---
So they fixed her like they fixed the bobbypins.  Except not like that at all because she's still broken.
---
Sometime.  Kinda depends because either she is broken OR the entire loot system is broken in a loot game.
---
And according to the other guy you can MAYBE fix it by finding the first thing YOU (and I assume only you) killed in giant battle that takes 20 minutes with tons of creatures.
---
F#@king awesome
---
Exactly! I play with my brother as well. We should be able to overlap into each other's build space and create a larger single camp together. Or better yet, create a community with other players. That would be sweet
---
It would be nice. We need more weekly events to  bring us together to work on something for neutral goal. The queen was that. But people are so varied on it it’s hard to get people rallied to help. I’ve met a lot of player s that are openly nervous about helping the 100+ players with TSE apt AAE weapons as they don’t have those weapons themselves and feel useless. Which is a bummer. 
---
Definitely not a way bigger break. Possibly a small break but anthem is currently 60 on metacritic which is only 7 points higher than fo76.
---
So wait you knowingly and willingly let a duper give you his duped gear to hold on to 
---
Uh that's against rules 
---
Ban is justified 
---
Hopefully these new brewing drinks give the edges needed. 
---
I got mine from doing the Power Up Event at the powerplants. 
---
I don't have any caps at all currently lol. Need to get on that! 
---
There are options to make the process of workshops easier.
---
I could also give it a try, Malgone is the name. 
---
Well I’ve had 15 perk slots in Strength since the early days because I knew I’d max them out. Just wish I could use more!! Dabbled and swapped but settled for the following...
---
Incisor x 3
---
Martial Artist x 3
---
Blocker x 3
---
Those 3 basically make you a bit of a fearless beast that can take a scrap, and dish out faster more brutal damage. I think those 3 are a must. 
---
Now unfortunately I’m a hoarder of Stimpaks and Radaways so I’ve still got Travelling Pharmacy maxed to 3. If I remove that perk my weight jumps by 200 lol.
---
I used to rely on the All Rise and a Bloodied Super Sledge so I put the Level 1 perk in Slugger, Master Slugger and Expert Slugger.
---
So I don’t actually use the equivalent one handed melee perk to buff the switchblade, I don’t feel I need it. 
---
I do have Adrenaline maxed to 5 in Agility though aswell and Radcool at 1. Throw in a couple of unyielding armour parts and drop your health to a low level that you are comfortable with (I like to play 30%-40%) and it makes all melee weapons awesome. 
---
I can easily just run into a corner faced with 20 or 30 ghouls and let them all run into me. One fast poke and they die. 
---
If they fix Adrenal Reaction then this set up would be even better. The switchblade base damage I usually find is around 150, sometimes higher sometimes lower depending on my health. So double that the first stab (instigating), and with its rapid movement you can easily dish out so much damage very quickly. But most enemies drop dead in 1 or 2 slashes in a split second. And it’s so much fun!! 
---
As with every other online games, I wished there were more people like you to make the world - in game and reality - a better place. Inspirational! *thumbs up emote*
---
Yes, the latest change probably makes the typical workshop griefing a lot easier.
---
Now I don't know, but I'm fairly optimistic that the claim is still required to initiate full scale PvP. And, by making the workshop big, you can deter people from trying to contest it from you.
---
I like that you've said and I have to agree about the carried over bugs from FO4 but also a bug from the coding of the dragons that was used for the Scorchbeasts... I saw one flying backwards. Lol. Now it was only one time but still. Hahaha. I actually loved seeing that 🤣
---
You made me smile.  That is what gaming is about for me.  There is a lot of hate and negativity surrounding fallout 76 on the internet but ingame most of the people have been nice / funny / friendly.  I am only level 57 myself but yesterday I helped a level 20+ and 30+ during a fight and they were really appreciative.  And when I made mistakes in the past (not sharing some kills at whitespring) I just got a thumbs down and no other bullshit. Learned me enough.
---
Saw this late. :( How'd it go?
---
So that would mean instigating without the explosive is better off? If there’s a pack of ghouls not half an inch next to each other then it’s better not to use IE?
---
This is really heartwarming. Respect
---
It’s still better too. Just a thought. No need to switch weapons like that. Unless you are out of ammo. 
---
Super not good. I forgot I had set my profile to offline so I ended up fighting her solo for 20 minutes of the fight. Had some peeps join up with like 10 minutes left, but too little too late. 
---
If there is a potential saving grace to the new vendor is hopefully allowing newer players to build up weapons and negate the feelings of uselessness.  I remember walking around bums-springs with a two-shot Tesla (that I found in a bag of items some heavy dropped as trash) just hoping to get a tag in on a few legendarys and maybe get something that made me dmg relevant.  Getting over that hump probably turns off a lot of players.
---
Ah sorry, I know what you mean now. No. West Tek won’t have them I don’t think. 
---
You may find them scattered around the Summersville Lake area but I reckon they spawn very randomly. 
---
That’s awesome.  I just may have to buy one because of the response.  
---
Idk all I’m saying is before they “fixed her” apparently (I didn’t really know they fixed her. I’m usually a see for myself type of person) when I would go to the event and help, sometimes we would kill her but there’s no loot, we would kill her and there was loot, or we could never kill her (there was just no damage being done) but now after the patch, there has only been at least 8 fights and 4/8 were successful with loot drops. I haven’t had a problem with her loot recently but have had a problem with not doing enough damage or just feeling like we could never kill her. 
---
Hindsight's a bitch, right?
---
Next time, just hold the world open for them instead of actually holding their stuff.
---
:( 
---
No I should have been more specific at the time I didn’t know he was a duper nor did I know that the ammo was duped Even tho it seemed weird I didn’t think nothing of it. I was helping him out in which now I realize the stupidest thing I could have done was help someone. So it is was it is I guess. What good was the maintenance that got rid of dupes if there just gonna ban people. 
---
Why do your little robots keep trying to kill me?  And why do they hover just outside Vault 76 trying to kill the unitiated?
---
The robots are not associated with us, sadly they mistake any living being with capitalist swine
---
I agree this game should not have been released yet. And no they will probably read this post but they more than likely won’t respond to it. 
---
I found mine in the open train carriage between watoga and the nar repair yard 
---
The system in itself seems extremely unstable, it may or may not work as it's supposed to, however I could be halfway across the map with no intention in reclaiming a workshop and someone who took it will downright track me down to kill me since we're both marked as hostile. That shouldn't be the case. I feel like there should be a limit of distance and time. There should be no reason someone can fast travel to the nearest marker, find my icon, and then kill me without slap damage just because they took my workshop.
---
Yeah I created a new psn just so I could play this game. I’m not even gonna trade with people anymore. I’ll hold worlds open but that’s it. 
---
Where have you been finding them? I've been all around the circle, and nothing. I'm level 79, am I too high of a level to complete it? 
---
Totally this. The first nuke I launched I targeted about there (had been there for an earlier zone before I knew how flux worked). The team playing with me was probably a bit annoyed at picking a spot with so few enemies (handful of ghouls plus a periodic Mirelurk Queen) but the violet flux was worth it. Picked up and converted enough to finally make my calibrated shocks, and made some for others in the group as a ‘thanks for letting me nuke somewhere totally boring’ gift. Absolutely worth it though :)
---
The best is trying to communicate with a new guy how to take the loot you just dropped him.  Constant squats, hitting the bag with a melee weapon, shinning your light on it.  Then finally there’s that eureka moment and he takes the contents of the bag.  I give him a thumbs up and I leave him to his business.  
---
Now here's a good idea
---
Thing is when you rent (which is already the opposite of buying and a mute comparison) a year later. The movie doesnt suddenly come with twice or four times the content and run time. There isnt suddenly 2 more hours of Avenger movie and cannonic lore on the redbox DVD. 
---
The realistic example is people paying 60 dollars to see a movie that hasnt been edited, no special effects or CGI yet, the camera at one point was left on for 10 minutes after the stage was cleared, and none of the story makes sense because they never edited the sequence of the plot just the order of which ever scene they acted out first. Then a year later they sell the movie with proper sequential order, good shot angles, fixed lighting, no "Action"/"Cut... redo!", CGI, and music added finally. Oh and the movie theater at least the movie runs or you get a refund. Unlike 76 which crashed for a majority of players and had multiple incompletable missions. But Bethesda had a no refund policy... so theres that. 
---
Just so we're clear; it's gear as in merchandise, not gear as in bought from the guy in the alley
---
Had that happen once after a nuke. It became a
---
a blueprint somehow. And couldnt place it. Destroyed the BP and it became stored, in its complete form. 
---
There are other perk cards scattered about which can and do make a big difference to my play style too. But it’s all about trying to fit all of them in that you find make the biggest difference. 
---
Serendipity x 3 in Luck gives a 45% chance of taking no damage when your health drops low. This is great in melee. 
---
Yeah - can't remember the last time I crafted and normal armour or weapons. 
---
Oh wait, it was back when I needed to scrap handmades to learn mods for it. That was about 80 levels ago. 
---
There are many gun plans I will never bother purchasing, because there is never any reason to craft them, sadly. 
---
Awesome I’ll check him out! Thank you
---
So conclusion? Either instigating explosive or just Instigating on any rifle? hunting or lever? I need to be 100% sure before I pick my main rifle.
---
I’ll take the armor over plans so thank you!
---
I can really advise just scrapping *all* your turrets. When it released I really wanted shit loads of cool rocket turrets to destroy everything, but I eventually realised that your camp can be really sweet if you don't waste half your budget on them.
---
Great thanks! 
---
Is that one of the common places to farm plans? 
---
They don't need to travel anywhere. The people doing this like to team up. One goes to workshop to contest it, other is aiming your head. The second contest is started, boom you die.
---
I can make u a basic wetsuit if u want mate. 
---
So if someone would nuke the Morgantown airport while I was playing, that’d be great, sips coffee, proceeds to watch office space. 
---
And this gets downvoted... why?
---
How cool of you, thanks.
---
I’m on ps4 and can pay you for them if you’d like. If you’re on ps4 also I won’t be on until tomorrow or 10 or so hours 
---
Where are the albino DeathClaws, Radscorps :( ?
---
Awww, that sucks.
---
That’s ambitious...
---
Well, you can try and use the PS4's messages to communicate with other players (if they allow random messages), if you don't have a headset, so that's a plus.
---
Otherwise, it's exactly the same game, but with a controller.
---
Oh damn forgot to check platform Im xbox. But would have done for free bud. 
---
&gt;His reaction once he realized what was going on has got to be the funniest thing I have ever seen. He was only a level 3 and obviously very new to the game.
---
He says he got memed. Yeah, he's more likely on his fifth alt.
---
Wow,  tear worthy story there. Absolutely top marks there. That's given me the good vibe boost I needed the day. 
---
My bro and I were thinking about Nuking Wavy Willards. But it's a lower level zone so that might be a dick move. 
---
Tbh all I know is I’ve had 2 crashes in F76 since I got it on release day.
---
And I’ve had 2 crashes on the same mission on Anthem, and I’ve only used 3 hours of my free trial.
---
The reviews I’ve seen for both were equally harsh.
---
&gt; I keep 15 of each bulk in my stash and sell the rest
---
Guess you don't use a shotgun much, that's a horrible waste of plastic.
---
Only bulk for sale.  
---
Awesome. I love how decentralised fallout76 feels.
---
Never knowing who you are playing with.
---
Omg I would pay real world money to have a server all to myself lol
---
Anytime you go to Watoga check the train car (on top of boxes) and then down to the train yard (on the table in metal building) I’ve gotten a bunch there. 
---
I once popped in just to see some 15 lvl player had his camp at my spot, so my camp didn't spawn. Instead of server hopping I stayed and added her to the team. I started building some new walls she might need, I had basically placed 3 different walls next to each other and she stood in front of the one she wanted and made the "shoot" emote, to let me know. She kept asking for stuff but it's ok since I had a lot of resources. Kinda greedier than other people I shared resources with, others are like "is it really ok, you don't need that? You don't need the junk?" but she was like "more walls!". It was a funny experience. And tbh, I'd spent the last of my resources if it meant helping someone. (Unless they want my primary weapon)
---
I make all low level players escovation armour level 25, mats are real easy. 
---
There are two outright lies in the statement and one half truth. Your response is to pick out the one half truth, claim it as being totally true and ignore completely the two outright lies. I'm afraid I'm not very convinced by this counter.
---
That 451 lvl is either a dev player or someone that does not need to go to work.
---
Great work!!
---
"Robot vendors no longer recognize you as human and won't trade with you, Grahm still will, and perhaps certain Ghouls will too."
---
welp, guess not many would go ghoul
---
This was always something I used to do in Ark: Survival Evolved.
---
I was essential the richest person on the entire server, and so if I noticed any new players who didn't know how to play or needed help, I would pick them up on one of my 30ish wyverns, give them a set of armor and weapons, along with a pteranodon (I never used them, they're easy tames and for some reason I had shit loads). I always answered questions they had and then they went on their way with their new gear and pteranodon. 
---
Always made me feel really good, helping all those players.
---
Highly agree. The no slap PvP related to workshop should only apply to workshop area and maybe little beond it.
---
I want a Vox mutation, like the vox syringer quest, so I can hear dialogue from all creatures and critters when in range but the downside would be all chickens, squirrels etc become savage because they don’t appreciate you even dropping on their conversations lol
---
I think the hate vs Fallout 76 was much higher because people were greatly disappointed. It was not the game they hoped for. Except for the people that jumped on the hate train to get some reviews and released hour long rant videos, Fallout 76 clickbait titles etc.
---
Fallout is a big and beloved IP. It has a huge fanbase. 
---
Anthem... well... people expected not much, specially because it's an EA IP and we all know EA. They always get the hate and people are already fed up with hate news about EA.
---
Doesn’t everybody pick up 100k ammo?  No?  Oh, ok
---
I don’t have a ton of experience with the queen, but I was a no-legendary carrying level 65 when I beat her the first time. It was me and about 4 others.
---
In the future, there is only war. And the Emperor, he protecc.
---
Only f. Can put an armed mini nuke in one! "Finally I found you!!!" POOF!
---
Lol I don't know.
---
Quoting it's wiki.
---
"The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on February 22, 2019.
---
Set on [...]
---
Anthem received mixed reviews from critics who found that it suffered from feeling repetitive, shallow, and purposeless. It's story, gameplay, grind and technical aspects were criticised, although its controls and visuals received some praise."
---
So do I understand it's been out like a week, and people are finding it "repetitive, shallow, and purposeless"? 
---
Yeah I mean it could be and you could find it out in a week, but maybe people need to find games they like, instead of finding games they dislike. Be more selective!
---
Anything that can be demolished should turn red so we know what we have to work with.
---
Im happy with 10% increase
---
As if the children of atom aren't already radical extremists
---
Everything.  Literally.  I’ve done the SBQ at least 30 times and it’s never not glitched.  Every time, without fail.  😑
---
Exactly
---
For anything Instigating higher base damage is better ifbyou use it as intended. You want to front load as much damage as you can into the first shot against a full HP enemy and after that shot the weapon no longer has a legendary effect. If you use it against enemies that you can one shot fire rate becomes a non-factor.
---
Furious 50 cal is pretty nice.
---
So god damned wholesome I love it 
---
I love this idea - I’m so tired of losing caps (and resources and time) after some dude has fast-travelled into my workshop for an easy kill (sometimes within minutes of me claiming it for the first time).
---
I’d much rather just surrender and get on with exploring without the grief.
---
I love building people the heavy gun turrets and fusion cores if they don't have them. The only time I was like, nah, was when someone wanted a lot of caps or my deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
Great. Thanks!
---
No, caps never. I remember a guy asking 9,5k for the neon letters plans. "I'll pay you back!" certainly doesn't make me trust someone. lol. But yeah fusion generators are really good for people. And after a while the cost isn't much for us.
---
Same.
---
Calmex for the Sneak attack bonus.
---
Canned Coffee for the AP regen.
---
Not sure what else, sorry.
---
The other day my brother and I were on a server with just one other person. If that server hadn't been laggy AF it would have been awesome. 
---
I'm a PC player and I don't think I've ever been on the marketplace lol 
---
I had one come to me and to this day I wish I had more to give... had just stopped at a trader to get rid of things (weight) and came across a new guy (with mic) I only had cheap armor to give but I gave what i had.  He said in the mic: 'Good luck to you fellow traveller;?" 
---
I reaally hope i meet him again in the wasteland
---
All they cared about is the money I heard of a bunch of people getting banned who just bought stuff they don’t care about there customers and the quest line in this game sucked beat it in 2 days was basically running around doing the same thing 
---
Wow the downvotes on these comments. People sure do love being lead by the hand.
---
It’s funny y’all are getting downvoted for saying facts about Beth . They’re a joke and they killed fallout 
---
No, I want to make "being a sack of shit" something that has consequences. 
---
Get out from the rock.
---
Do you have a link to these power armor model edits? I know about the paints, but haven't seen anything for models
---
No. Because the griefers aren't going to head over to "survival" mode. Their preferred targets will stay in "adventure" mode, and bethesda's shown zero inclination for making the game less shitty for people who don't want to be griefed by random shitty assholes. 
---
If they do this...I'll probably leave the game completely. This is a fucking horrible idea. 
---
I would typically be against children playing games like this, for the frightening elements and assmonkeys on the mics. Seems this waa a good experience for him though.
---
Enjoy your duped item ban...
---
Usually if I go into a SBQ fight, the server lags by about...literally half an hour. It's completely unplayable. 
---
Characters like Cait &amp; Codsworth are what keep me adventuring in the Commonwealth.
---
I mean, the salt is real, but the "jokes" that lead up to it are completely justified. I honestly wouldn't be shocked if they shipped one made out of wood that doesn't have conductors at this point. 
---
Managed to succeed last night after 4 attempts though out the day. Total luck nothing else so annoying 
---
He gave you 100k bullets of course he is duping, you should have never picked it up. Bethesda has been quite clear that if you have any dups in your inventory you will get banned 
---
This is 100% your own fault, I've had dupers drop me shit too just wake away with out touching the bag and no problems 
---
Sorry you couldn't fallow the rules and that resulted in a ban 
---
This is the best thing I've read all day.
---
I hardly think 2.8k is duped
---
Pretty sure the abundance of sales is due to their being no new Atom store content this week. We'll be back to one off sales again soon, I think! 
---
Agree with the first thing, disagree with the second thing. I think thats hyperbole. 
---
We all know 76 isn't a "main" fallout title, otherwise it would have been called fallout 5. This is meant as kind of a "snack sized" game to hold you over until the next big release (Starfeild, TES6, FO5), and was marketed as such. I had no delusions of grandeur that this would be the defining game of the series. I got what I expected, more with the new roadmap, and I'm relatively happy. They never said "NPC's! Dialogue! Impactful Decisions!" at any point leading up to launch. It had bugs, those got fixed, it has a couple more bugs, those will get fixed. Other BGS titles have had far more serious bugs, never to be fixed, and still have won game of the year.
---
But their merch situation is fucking laughable, and people should absolutely be pissed who paid money for that stuff. 
---
TLDR, quit whining about the game. We know, they know, go play Apex or Anthem or something because no one cares anymore. At this stage you either play bgs games or you dont. 
---
You probably would have torn down my camp anyway, so good riddance 🤷‍♂️
---
And we will keep an eye out for your 
---
"I did nothing wrong but I've been banned!!!"
---
3k bullets lol at once? Lol don't people understand what duping is 
---
Enjoy the ban 
---
Personally i find 800 to be enough and "sane".
---
Could be cool if they were tied together somehow. Like you get more stash when you have fewer camp items.
---
Even fo4. If you’ve played the earlier titles then you know Beth just turned it into a re-skinned Skyrim kiddie game 
---
Wow you guys really don't understand how the duping bans worked do you?  Less than 3k 45 ammo in a bag with much smaller amounts of other ammo?  That's just someone dropping extra weight.  I sometimes craft 5-10k in a day.
---
**"Dev Note:** The ability to  contest a claimed Workshop is intended and encouraged behavior as part of Workshop design."  
---
Why people don't want to accept that Workshops are made to be contested and to encourage PvP?
---
If you don't want to take the risks, nobody is forcing you to take one.  
---
I know that a lot of old Fallout players are used to only do PvE, but this isn't (exclusively) that type of game, it's time to understand it.  
---
The wasteland should be a dangerous place.  
---
For in-game lore you're only talking about how the mothman is depicted in the game. I was expecting references to the *The Mothman Cometh* holotapes, the museum, all the notes and other holotapes, the worship of the mothman. And then see if you can find corresponing events in the west virginia folklore. 
---
They might make camps not take damage from other players in adventure mode? Would be great! Can't imagine how else to do it... Hoping to stumble on other people's homes with a possible vending machine is unlikely... Just have a terminal where all current server's players stuff is for sale is lame and will get old fast.
---
Maybe building the vending machine should show your camp on the map? 
---
If you haven't been to Johnsons Acre please go there for nearly unlimited (actually 3 shots per server) fun. Its disconnected to the main story of your post,  but its an absolutely great place to show people weird stuff
---
L:dr
---
This should be an option, and you should turn it on/off
---
Got to admit it’s moments like that which really build the trust between strangers, shows that people do look out for each other and help in games when they have no need or agenda to do so, gg!
---
It's also being knocked because it represents nothing what people expect from Bioware.  None of their games do anymore (looking at you Andromeda).
---
*This is such and admirable and interesting post, I took the liberty of copy proofing for clarity making it easier to read. Hope this is not to presumptuous of me, I'm no English major, just did my best.*

(Spoilers just for a hidden area at a location, not story spoilers or such) 
---
I was minding my own business, scrapping all the golf balls in the  world at the White Springs Station and checking my challenges late at  night and 2 people ran up to me asking if I had a mic. I didn't see them  as they were coming from behind while in my pipboy and honestly thought  they were griefers cause this was about 4am. 
---
Lo and behold, it was a high  level 60 player and a low level 30 player. They were amazed I had a mic when I responded and they told me they quit after 2 weeks because of the monotonous cycle that 76 created and other games that came out, so decided to try 76 again. 
---
No one talked to them and I said that it was pretty common that not everyone uses a mic that often unless its the  Queen. Things have changed a lot since that time though. 
---
I filled them in on everything that has changed and occurred and what the future entails; the pacifist mode becoming more known, the TSE meta, the dupers crashing the trading market prices, the big patches that changed things (and reversed things accidentally), the annoying current meta of assassin and sentinel/cavalier, making PvP a snoozefest, the new  content we're getting and all that stuff. 
---
They were surprised so many  things have changed and whatnot and were curious what a level 190 was doing still playing the game and I told them 'Easy', the exploration.  This game has the best and most realistic approach to exploring that I've felt in a game. Has some cool things and has some normal things. A game about Easter eggs and enjoying the story the environment so you have to figure out what happened.

In their time, they said they hadn't really found too many awesome places and felt that was a factor that caused them to stop. I never stopped and have around 350 hours in since beta time, so I joined their squad and showed them to two specific areas that perfectly showed what Fallout 76 was created for; Lucky Hole Mine and  Tanagra Town. 
---
Lucky Hole Mine is amazing for lead veins and crystals but it also has the best Easter egg in the game I feel (not really a spoiler since its not story related but I've marked it such just cause). I fast travelled and told them to come to me there. They didn't know about the place and I explained that this is the absolute best place for lead making and all that stuff. We went in and since I had the keys, we went into the awesome place much faster.
---
&gt;!We ran and I went inside the tight gap behind a small dead bush and they thought that was neat, because they never would've noticed it. I then mentioned if they didn't see it then they definitely won't see this one coming and I backed into the wall of grass and they flipped their shit cause they didn't expect a hidden area inside a hidden area. We went inside and I showed them the Lovecraftian creature Lucky Hole Mine is known for, they thought that was crazy and super unique.!&lt;
---
I explained Fallout 76's background lore and the crazy cultists that followed the veins and vines that have slowly taken over the Marshes and made their way through the ground and &gt;!pointed out the bizarre heads lined all along the back wall and the vines that moved from the giant creature on the ground!&lt;. They never  expected something like that and they were immediately hooked on the  preface of exploring extra areas to find the hidden lore that 76 offers nearly everywhere. 
---
Next stop was the town in the sky: Tanagra.  
---
This one they really enjoyed because of how unique of a location it is visually. &gt;!We went inside and I showed them the same face that was inside the Lucky Hole Mine!&lt; and told them that everything sort of connects together in mini stories that the player has to connect themselves and showed them how unique an area can be, but also once at  the top, how there wasn't much of a point. 
---
I did show them the one house tilted so hard that it gives everyone a sense of vertigo and wooziness. Seriously, whoever designed that was great, this was the first time a game visually fucked with my senses and made me feel weird, I showed them some notes and such. 
---
This was only about an hour of interacting but pretty much told them that the game is all about exploring; looking  into everything and such. Talked about how some additions like actual humanoid NPCs and some other things might help but the small adventure I gave them gave them a new perspective on how 76 functions versus the other games it builds from. 
---
It was late about 5:30am, they added me as a friend, thanked me for the adventure and left, but it gave me a feeling of jealousy because how they reacted is exactly how I reacted when I played those areas first and how there is an innocence that the Fallout franchise creates that leaves memories that we cherish. 
---
Lots of  people help out low level people but literally bringing life into a game for people that they think was dead that I still enjoy gives me hope for the future of 76 and for those that will come back from the past and notice how much the game has changed and all the things it can offer if the effort is put in. 
---
In my experience with high levelers, they drop a bag for me and I'm like oh that's cool, then i look in the bag and its stuff im clearly not high enough level to use and a bunch of ammo
---
....^am i just an inventory dump to^you
---
Last queen I helped kill yesterday had no loot. All the mobs killed around her also dropped nothing. They all had empty inventory. 
---
It was either an infinite spinner or you could access her body but it had nothing. Was a bit pissed to be honest... Stayed around until she disappeard. Nothing in the end. 
---
Previous kill gave me 1* furious walking cane... 
---
I always feel this when I log out, I'm always putting far too much effort into workshops.. 😅
---
Hmm... how much have you built around it? you may need to move camp if it wont let you select the piece.. or possibly jump into the water and you might be able to get to it from there.
---
That’s a horrible idea unless they remove all PvP from adventure mode.
---
Or I guess I could assume it’s what Bethesda wants and use that opportunity to wreck bases and cause hate and discontent.
---
No, no revealing camp locations unless more thought is put into its implementation.
---
Yes, WANT
---
While a creation of the old world Communist army designed to harass Capitalist forces, it was the Enclave who released the ones that now plague post-war Appalachia in an attempt to trick the region’s DEFCON system into elevating its alert level. I find them to be a useful source of steel, fusion cells and posters to further the cause of Appalachian Communism, as well as a valuable XP boost and target practice at lower levels - I aid those who have just emerged from the vault in dispatching the little menaces when I can. We only have the best interests of our region’s people at heart. Remember: whenever you destroy those robots, you are helping all Appalachians!
---
I just hate that the free resources go to waste. Like, I used them all... if you stand in the camp while I log out, you can keep the structures AND restock the materials to add on additional structures.
---
I’ve fast traveled to 2 lower level people now and invited them to my team hoping to give it away... but both have ignored me and then logged out of the world 
---
Legend
---
&gt; A lot of players have a very narrow-minded vision of what Fallout is supposed to be.  And, for that matter, 76 tried to be a lot of different things at once, and you usually leave the hardcore players unhappy when you do that.
---
The issue was and is that even though it tried to cater to the beth sandbox audience and the online pvp audience, the implementations and mechanics for both of these games inside a game are fundamentally flawed and broken.
---
You can pick 5€ indie survival early access games from 5 years ago doing a way better job.
---
This is not about the nature of jack of all trades at all.
---
The issue isn't "are the items duped" the issue is, Bethesda doesn't like it when you pick up large volumes of "rare" items from the ground. Such as ammo. 
---
Heavy combat is the best overhaul, but if you managed to get a full heavy metal set with grounded mutation , you’re set , because energy weapons in this game sucks lol . 
---
Nice try when you it have 50 points to spend and you seem to have 8x7=56.
---
;)
---
&gt;loot is broken and inconsistent
---
From what I learned about Skinner boxes, loot (reward) has to be inconsistent (unpredictable) for best results (dopamine).
---
Not now. Unless the spinning arrow problem is solved, it is unwise to add more load to the server.
---
Beth released a statement on who was getting banned and why.  Anyone banned had a minimum of 100k of particular items.  Why don't you do some research before you go fear mongering?
---
I just go to whitesprings golf club n keep server hopping killing the horde that’s inside 
---
The only ammo that gets you banned is ultracite.
---
I think I can craft sturdy metal, how/ can you craft heavy metal or heavy combat armor? 
---
Do you just rush inside or aggro them to the cars?
---
All you people saying he will get banned...you guys are on a whichhunt. Ultracite ammo was the only ammo that ever got anyone banned, the only ammo actually hard to make. 
---
Caps don't mean anything these days imo. You need to trade something; godly equipment of yours to get AAE Handmade / Combat Shotgun. But good luck getting one! :)
---
PS: this is why people excited about the incoming patch legendary vendor, because everyone can scrap their useless legendaries for your "dream" legendary.
---
I was shocked the other day when level 68 super mutants spawned at Billings Homestead. That's in the Forest. I had never seen that level there before.
---
No I wait like 30 sec so everything loads up , on PS4 btw then I rush in , I have a vampire machete with swing speed so I don’t worry bout dying to them 
---
Great idea! I can't wait to accuse the opposing candidate of being a sexist, racist, homophobe, xenophobe, trasnphobe along with everyone who doesn't vote for my candidate. 
---
Where did they say this? I'd like to read it myself as there's a couple of things I've been waiting for a sale on and I'd be disappointed if I lost my chance to get them altogether.
---
'Look at me, I'm better than everyone else and don't (can't) read' O\_o
---
Advertising your short attention span, displaying your limitations like a badge of honour?
---
Very sweet story :)
---
Do you keep drop site v9 outta nuke zone or anything like that?
---
Can I please find an actual ultra left communist ONCE when looking at the post history of someone rejecting reality? It's so predictable what I'm going to find it's ridiculous.
---
No idea, 500+hrs and im still looking lol. If you find it let me know pls. Got heavy armor arms plan from an encleave quest and heavy robot chest plan in the marsh but no dice anywhere yet with bos heavy armor or plans 😐
---
&gt;Johnsons Acre
---
Thanks for the tip, on my list of places to visit.
---
I can craft heavy combat armor . You can easily farm heavy combat armor pieces (legendary and Normal ones ) by doing BoS events . Monster mash event is a almost guarantee heavy combat piece drop too .
---
Incoming the 20 different videos from youtubers about this single tweet. LUL
---
I received my plans from doing BOS events and handing in Technical Data. I got the Heavy plans from the Watoga vendor if memory serves. 
---
Buy the plans now at vendors and learn BOS skill by scrapping loads of Combat Armor.
---
Wotaga, Grafton and Charleston I think.
---
I got all mine from grafton, train station and responder.
---
And this is why I love this game. Honestly I’ve had great experiences with other players! I’m a lowbie myself (lvl 30) and a higher level player straight up came to my camp, dropped me a shit tonne of pricked water and kitted our my CAMP for me, and I mean kitted it out! I’ve got everything I need now. Such kindness goes a long way 
---
Haha that was a golden reply :) 
---
Above 50 all levels are essentially equal in pvp
---
prior to patch 5 they where common off the 2 grafton vendors, since that patch i hvnt seen any plans for it. bos paintjob for helemt can be learned by scrapping armor
---
I think they have fixed this. No plans at grafton anymore.
---
If your level is low, go to the club house, quickly close in to spawn then jump up onto near by bushes and walls so as to snipe/tag as many as possible, eventually a higher level with bully in and clear out the mobs, just get your tags in quickly.
---
As your level increases you'll be able to handle the mobs yourself. I have raised 50 levels in about a week of casual playing by running the Whitespring circuit to sort out my mess of a build. This seems the fastest way to speed level.
---
Obviously 
---
It's generally how it works for games that release on multiplatform, that consoles have a larger population.  The barrier to PC gaming is often considered (even if it isn't really true) to be prohibitively expensive.
---
I've been playing every day since the B.E.T.A. was launched, maybe four hours on average, and I just hit lvl 172. I'm mostly only doing one level up per day (for the daily challenge), but I noticed I can easily manage two levels a day when I'm doing the Whitesprings round excessively, even at my current level, and without any EXP boosts except Well Slept.
---
That said, &gt;400 sounds quite over the top, but maybe it's doable without exploits if that person is server hopping and clearing every blast zone they can find, or constantly launching nukes themselves.
---
All above level ~65.  You still need some additional levels to collect the higher Level perks, E.g. Adrenalin. 
---
Then why did you make your (obvious) post?
---
I am going to enjoy survival for 1 reason, seems 90% of the time i'm tootaly invisible and cant be attacked while playing. Knowing bethesda that bug wont be fixed b4 servers are launched
---
What do you mean, what is this bug you speak of 
---
It has been &gt;75% off in the UK for PC
---
Once you get to the end in the Glassed Cavern, there’s a woman’s body and if you loot it you can sometimes get BoS armor. If you don’t see the one you want, make sure you don’t pick up anything because if you do and server hop, chances are you won’t get something new off of her body. (And do not pick up anything at the glasses cavern as well just on the safe side.) But if you are going in there just to grab armor and scrap it, do understand it’s probably really rare to learn the BoS paint for it, or if you even can. Still trying to find out by doing my own runs occasionally. 
---
thats why IMO \^\^ i feel that the 75% armor pen does more on higher monster with high def rate, sure on mid level mobs raw dmg does more but as u say its a personal preference... yeah but i think blocker is a importent skill because we are all time in melee range and if we die much more because of not having blocker, we do also less dmg because we are dead \^\^
---
thats why i run a PA Bloody build with all possible def perks and a emergency protocoll on chest to stay long as possible alive :)
---
Ok, yeah I got fix it good maxed. So I can the heavy type from scraping combat armor? If so, that's awesome, I just need to keep scraping. 
---
to other players it's like i'm not even on the server. i can be in partys with friends and even that dosn't give a nametag or any indication of where i am.
---
Tested it out yesterday i don't take any dmg when shot at during that time.
---
But there is a lot of people with duped guns yet they aren’t banned? They had maintenance that removed dupes but only left one of each in there inventory. They aren’t banned. And did you even read what I wrote. Yeah I’m aware that I held duplicated ammo did I know at the time that it was duped. No. Only thing I knew at the time was this dude was wanting me to hold ammo for him so he could switch characters. I’m just saying that it’s bs. Take for example  you have a person who doesn’t get on Reddit, Facebook or YouTube. Or maybe doesn’t have any friends that play and he or she is just running around the map and comes across a bunch of stuff that a duper’s left in a world container and they pick it up then a week later there banned for picking up something they didn’t even no was wrong is it there fault also. Either way I’ve said all I’m gonna say they can do what they want. Be sure to down vote all y’all want. Have a good day. 
---
Need this on PC... to destroy it. Raiders for life! 
---
Even when I am in the water I can't scrap it and I don't want to rebuild my entire camp either 
---
You can get mods by scraping armor pieces , to craft the armor itself you have to the plans .i don’t remember where I get my plans, but I think that the station vendor bots my have these for sale .
---
The first day I played it for 2 hours and when I went to exit the game it shut my PS4 down completely and I had to manually turn it on after a unplug. If that’s not game breaking idk what is. 
---
Also made a post on the anthem sub and got a lot of people having the same experience. 
---
Still not addressed by BioWare.
---
Silly question but have you restarted the game? will it let you select the piece at all or swap it for a different floor? Which platform are you on?
---
Probably cap farmers
---
&gt; I've mention, I have friends who played FO76, loved it, and returned it just because of the hate.  
---
Yeah, no. I seriously doubt that's what actually happened. Most likely they played it a while and enjoyed it, then got bored when new games came out.
---
and THAT is Content we WANT... nice ideas men :)
---
Great idea!
---
It's true that there are a more helpful players than griefers. However - and maybe it's just my bad luck - I've run into 5 of them over the last 2 days, and I've noticed a great uptick in the amount of griefers over the past month in general. Heck, even last night I had a dude level my base before his friend killed him off for the caps. 
---
Not sure if it's just my bad luck, though... But griefers do seem to be becoming more of a problem lately. A raider faction would probably tickle their fancy tbh.
---
Thank you for sharing. 
---
Don’t the clean skins in the atom shop do this? I could have sworn I saw a video saying less smoke and noise from the clean version. Don’t hold me to it though.
---
Ooo the end bit got me. Gaming can be such a good escape for kids
---
Love this story
---
I'm level 29 and the panic for screws died down for me after I completed my Excavator PA and I crafted/scrapped enough handmade to get the essential mods I wanted. However, I still go on runs for them as I know there are still more I want and eventually I'm going to upgrade that armor.
---
Oh ok, I'll have to start searching for the heavy plans I guess. Thanks man!
---
If we're being real- that's a really shitty response. That PR rep might be tired of the jokes, but Bethesda put themselves in that position by attempting to shaft their customers with an underhanded bait and switch on the canvas bag. If you don't want irate customers making jokes at your expense and smearing your brand, maybe don't be scummy and lie on your product descriptions. You don't have a right to get sarcastic and pissy at people you try to scam and cheat. 
---
Yes I restarted the game I am on PS4 and it doesn't let me select it 
---
8 mins load times? No. There are far more load screens than is necessary (Hell, you need to go through a load screen even if you just want to swap loadouts, and that's a huge negative for the game) but if your game takes 8 mins for each load screen then there's something wrong with your hardware. The story is so-so for a game of this genre. It's nothing compared to the story driven single player RPGs, but it's enough to keep you interested in what's going on in the game. I've played for about 15 hours, and haven't been DC'd mid-match yet (I think the frequent disconnections were a problem with the beta, and not the actual full release). The looting and shooting is excellent so far, but the lack of end-game is gonna be a bummer once I finish the campaign.
---
Stopped watching gamer youtubers years ago. It's all one big pile of garbage. 
---
I love when higher levels help me out. I'm level 33 now, which isn't exactly low, but I've had bullets, aid items, weapons, plans, even a set of power armour dropped for me. I love the community that have stayed with FO76, all (most of) the toxic players have abandoned it because of the bugs, and it's pretty much a humble and wholesome Appalachia every time I log in. Thank you, everyone.
---
So BOS amor is basicly just a paint?
---
If you want the plan you will have to be one of the first to watoga after the server refreshes. (idk when that is)
---
Generally I find them a lot easier in the early a.m. as it seems when people get up or off work the stations plans get low. I’m still missing the chest piece as of now. I’ve seen it once, but it was after a cap run and spend so I was broke 🤷‍♂️
---
I try the Come Here emote but they often stand 50ft away and get jumpy. I usually get through to them eventually. Sometimes I just leave the supplies and walk away. I check back after 5-10 mins to make sure they took everything. Whatever they don't take gets given to another lowbie. Because I spend so much time scavenging, I often leave 10-15 Plans/Recipes.
---
Probably should’ve used a better word for it. I never know what it’s called so I just call it paint. I’m on right now so I’ll check. 
---
The reason why the interior of the Whitespring is not affected is because all the npcs in there are "unique" Whitespring-variant robots already at their maximum possible level, I believe.
---
Assassin’s Sentinel if your ranged. Assassin’s Cavalier if your melee. These are the best two sets for pvp. They are normal armor.
---
Why exactly shouldn't I be allowed to build on the only flat and manicured ground in the entire game?
---
Agreed, it’s actually been a pretty fun bug to deal with. Deathclaws are scary but losing your camp is even scarier :0
---
I’ve pretty much done it in every way possible, leaving this and that out, spawning in different places, less people, more people.  It’s just a serious bug that needs some work.  The TSE’s don’t help still, lots of ammo noise glitches and sometimes causes the SBQ to freeze up completely in one spot.  It’s really odd, but in all those fights not one of them was clean server wise.  It’s gotten worse with the infinite loading bags and bodies too, the lag itself is really brutal no matter how many people show up.  Not sure what needs to be done but I hope there’s a patch for it soon.  
---
Kill critters for food, they're plentiful around Flatwoods. Radaway is easy to scavenge. Take the Gunsmith Perk up to Lv5 to help with Weapon degradation. Weapon Artisan also helps with keeping your Weapons in top condition.
---
This is so good, I also love doing this. Was helping a few kids out and they wanted my power armour hahah had to explain how all that works too but I said when he is high enough leve I will make home ones
---
It was discussed once but yeah its a rad edition to the game now tables and stuff have more purposes mabey especially with the patio type furniture it needs more than just a table and some chairs
---
You must be new to earth.
---
I'm level 29. Saw a level 7 and waved at him to follow me to my camp. I gave some purified water , tato , and 2 simpacks and ammo. I dropped the ammo and simpacks on the floor and pointed with my shotgun . He didn't understood and I shot the bag I dropped, he was confused I shot my gun and was ready to run , he hesitated and finally returned to pick up the bag.... There was love all over the place when he was starting throwing hearts at me ...😂. 
---
On the other side , I saw a couple of 5 levellers wandering around my camp , suddenly they were wanted and starting waving for help .My turrets started shooting at them , they began to throw granades at my camp and then I ended there miserable lives with a head shot... Suddenly 2 high levels popped up in the map , seeking revenge. ( There's somewhere a review about them ) so I think the wanted players were bait so the high levels could kill me. 
---
I logged out of the came to enter another world. 
---
That's not my kind of game....
---
I enjoy meeting new players and learn about the game. 
---
greerings from Belgium
---
Human skulls and empty vodka bottles everywhere
---
From what I've seen having bloodied or furious is great and from what i hear swing speed is useless so far no one knows if auto melee weapons will ever be effected by swing speed
---
Be that as it may, it's still a funny response as in it has a hint of self-deprecation. While that not might be everyone's cup of tea in regards to joking, it's still a popular modern format for joking.
---
I prefer the eye socket gotta stay classy
---
Only one greifer but I've run into a dozen or so total douchebags.  That's just the way that the math works out though.
---
Sorry, NutSupreme, let me get out the empty wine bottles to give this place some class.
---
&gt;Why people don't want to accept that Workshops are made to be contested and to encourage PvP?
---
Because of the way it works out. People don't want those workshops. They want easy kills.
---
I was hoping it would since martial artist increases damage 
---
Now were talking those dumb candles finally have more use just me my eye sockets and a bottle of wine
---
This is gold 
---
Yeah ive seen people do the test and it seems those weapons already go so fast it cant really go faster it would he awesome tho probably loud as hell tho
---
You will laugh hard once you find it
---
Now I can store those volatile materials boxes really unsafely like I've always wanted to! One under the bed, next to the oven, in the fridge...
---
I need gas cans next to the fire pit 
---
Set up a camp next to a crashed car and put shot glasses, whiskey bottles and beer bottles in the car
---
Dieeee you commie scumm!
---
I’m not crying your crying!! Who is cutting onions!!! 
---
Funny that most of my group of friends I was playing FO76 with are now playing anthem and want me to join them. I'm not enjoying FO76 as much because they left, but I'm still not jumping ship to a game thats where FO76 was 3 monthes ago while I'm still enjoying myself. 
---
It’s not hard to accumulate that many bullets over some time, I dropped 4K 10mm bullets the other day because I never use them. Hope someone found them and has a use for them. I never crafted them so those were found from enemies and ammo boxes. 
---
I've also never played it, but didn't anthem's servers all go down during the beta? 
---
I would use Mr handyj blueprints as kindling, I've found so many. It isn't as bad as the mole miners gauntlet, but it's still really common.
---
They aren’t great but it is the only thing right now in the game where I feel like I’ve accomplished SOMETHING when I’m done.  And when I do launch, I feel like the other people on the sever are excited as well... I know I look forward to it when I hear the warnings. 
---
I haven't gotten any duplicates of it yet. 
---
Yep.
---
Are you over encumbered?
---
No even my reload speed slows down.
---
KUDOS 
---
OPs idea doesn't change anything with regards to the dev note though.  People would still be free to take owned workshops, it would actually be easier to take one.
---
Only someone who has played both (small group) could answer this BUT if you want to add a few mods which greatly increase enjoyment, like glowing plans/cap containers/bags and like to have a perk loadout manager, then PC might be the way you want to go.
---
I got stuck on main quests too. They just stopped telling me where to go. 
---
Yep, hire this legendary Wendy's social media  girl to burn the trolls. Couple of weeks would be enough. 
---
Another thing that I have heard before but is always worth mentioning is give us the ability to have clean non broken windows. Why would I build a wall with busted out windows?
---
Except ItsaGundam haha love that cranky old fart 😉
---
The plans are available (albeit rarely) from the vendors at Harper's Ferry and Watoga.
---
I had same problem but I enjoyed the exploring and finding things by my sel pretty sure I did the main quest line out of order 
---
Not every new player wants to be gifted your hand me downs. Many people find most enjoyment in finding their own stuff. Especially right out of the gate. 
---
I'm pretty sure this will never happen. IIRC it was explained in new Vegas that it'd be difficult to manufacture those bottle caps as most of the technology has been lost to do so through the war. Especially the unique paint the caps have. It's the reason caps are even used as a currency.
---
I have met similar great and fun people trust me i didn't use a mic now i do its more fun you can meet all different people.
---
As soon as I log on I try to find the lowest player on the map and try and drop some stuff off in from of them....stimpacks, maps etc
---
Well, if given the chance, everybody would surrender them.
---
Workshops are a gimmick made to put people against each other, in a fight for resources.
---
It shouldn't be an "easy" way to farm them.
---
They should buff them, right now nobody takes them because are pretty useless.
---
MATN goes alright
---
My Friend at level 28 one killied me in one head shot when I was lvl 109 fully buffed. Thought it was hilarious in some ways but also broken. We where testing out how pvp dmg worked at the time.
---
What he said. My friends had me wait and I am so thankful! 
---
Holy shit, that’s great. That kid really will be talking about that for a long time. I think it’s a seriously good lesson too to see that there’s good people on the other side of the screen. Plus his parents sound great too to be checking on what he’s up to online 
---
if adding camp budget becomes a pay to acquire item they will lose people. Smarter to give it for free and have people pay for decorations. 
---
Here's a porta potty trap:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKv1gW1qSF8
---
This is a prime example of why we need an in-game chat system.
---
It would be more helpful than coming to the forums to say this which everyone will probably ignore because the odds of landing on your particular server are not very good.
---
It would just be so cool to be able to say that on a server wide chat so you know the items you put in chests for others won't be wasted. 
---
Tip: put a skin on one of them and you will have the Atom icon after the name.
---
&gt; provide food and water
---
This isn't true communism comrade
---
Hmmm did they increase it's difficulty last patch? I don't realize if they did. I don't often do them but usually if I go it seems to gradually go down.
---
I recently tried to participate on my first queen on my level 26 alt. Excluding me, the lowest level was 60+. Then the rest were all above 100, few above 200. About 10 players in total. I joined there about 4-5 mins from beginning as I was busy looting my 3 workshops,  I tagged enemies a bit with my molotovs, tried to dump all my nuke granades on the queen with no impact. 
---
As it seemed the players were not really making good progress on the queen healt bar, some shooting it, some shooting the other enemeies, and I could't even sufficiently hurt any of the level 50 adds, I left the area about 17 minutes left on the event so that my presense doesn't hurt it. It did kinda look like they weren't going to do it, I can't remember if the whole time is 30 or 25 mins. Many times teams that do it, do in like 5 mins or little more.
---
But so, it's an end boss. The only one we have, currently. And not a very elaborate one.  So, should you always succeed it? I think it's fair for it to be challenge enough, so that some groups will fail it.
---
Farm legendarys for 2 hours and sell all those 1* wooden armour pieces, I'd be rich
---
do u use grenades or switch often weapons?
---
i got early the problem that my max speeded hunting rifle slows down on reload AND firerate after equiping grenades and stuff or switching weapons.
---
ok that should not effect your movement speed but i have noticed that speed bug on my weapon (was fixed after unequip grenades and the rifle and reequip the rifle)

That is the sweetest thing ever. A teammate of mine helped my daughter out yesterday - made some combat armor for her, and gave her a vampire's handmade and some serums and stuff (she just hit lvl 25). She was so excited and turned to me after she killed a few Scorched with her new gun and said "Oh my God, I'm healing as I hit stuff! I'm not gonna die as much now!!!" It was gold.
---
The thing with leveling up nowadays is that after so many nerfs, you need to kill dozens of enemies to get a inch of the level bar filled.
---
Even yesterday I was close to leveling to 93 and I thought, ok lets grind until its done. 
---
I cleared the golf course and surroundings, then I cleared 20 super mutants at summersville, then I went to Hopewell Cave where I killed one level 85 deathclaw, 2 scorchbeasts and at least a dozen of scorched and also 3 fogcrawlers. All this to fill like not even 1 cm of the level bar.
---
Grinding like is frustrating af...
---
I do use mutiple weapons it was fine until i put on mutations its very strange.
---
Are you sure? I just did 2 levels in an hour just clearing the club and hopping
---
At the end of Glassed Cavern there is a body that will have a couple of pieces. That's the only guaranteed world spawn I know of.
---
Not rebuild. Just make a blueprint of all your Camp and then move it a bit until the floor is out of the water. Scrap the piece and re-settle your Camp where it was.
---
\+karma
---
I’ve been avoiding that part of the game because I feel like needing to deal with a mule would get in the way of just having fun with the game. Hopefully once vending and the legendary trader gets added a lot of those kinks will get worked out. 
---
Tag
---
So every day once i assume? Found it and it had two pieces but had no luck.
---
Nah. 
---
Hats off to you 😁😁
---
Yes im sure. Why would I lie about this?
---
Im currently just trying to reach level 100. Im pretty much done with everything else.  
---
Maybe the grind depends on the level? Later levels are harder to grind bc they get less xp from kills? What level are you? 
---
I have an instigating buzzblade.  Perhaps the most ironic roll possible. 
---
That’s awesome! Enjoy it!
---
And to those who are saying duped, relax. Someone could totally make that at Munitions in a few hours.
---
Fot the common ammo types, such as 45, not having few thousands of em if you don't just drop em would actually be strange
---
Don't rush through the main quest; that was my mistake
---
49 points. And you start with 1 in any special, not 0. (8-1)*7=49. Math confirmed
---
Basically in the circle. Mostly in the houses/apartments. I feel your pain, been doing this since just after Christmas. I had a couple of lower levels with me and didn't notice any improvement. Bitch of a quest.
---
Buddy got a vampire faster swingspeed with some 3 stat never dies
---
Depends, for protection its combat armor, but if you want to balance cost to build/repair, protection and durability, leather armor can be extremely useful on the long run.
---
86 actually
---
Thanks guys and girls ;)
---
Was fun as always, never been to a SBQ fight with you that failed, lot's of fun :)
---
IM NOT CRYING 
---
A lot of the time you have to pick stuff up to initiate the missions. Just keep exploring and you’ll run into quests. Play all the holo tapes and read the notes everywhere. 
---
Turrets should be much stronger and durable. Their build cost are just fine so people don't make pure turret farms with ridiculously amount of defense. However normal structures build limit should be increased a bit so people could decorate more their camps.
---
I played one handed for a bit i recommend the ski sword i thing there is a named varient aswell called black diamond, personally i used a legendary vampire combat knife and shanked everything in my sight that moved rarely died due to the vanpire effect combined with the fast swing speed.
---
Thanks didn't need sleep
---
I just go to the bog. Grab cranberries make a pie that gived me an xp boost. If They spoil i go gather more. It's quicker than feed the people. The diseased cranberries makes juice but lower so gain
---
But dropping bulk stuff into a box sounds a lot easier and straight forward.  Someone comes up, they already know stuff in box is free.
---
What else would you do with the legendaries, if not use? Use them to fix your broken grand piano leg?
---
&gt;from them being legendary
---
You sure you conception about what a "legendary" is, is correct?
---
I have to disagree with you.
---
I want vending machines on my Camp property and the only way anybody will ever find my Camp is if it shows up on the map.
---
Maybe they will add an optional on/off for it if people get so upset about it they threaten to leave the game. 
---
I have lots of great stuff to sell. I don't use 3rd party markets and have been hoarding. 
---
As for griefers, who cares? I have enough junk to repair my entire base dozens of times. 
---
Lol grandpa
---
Hmm, that's at Seneca Rocks south peak right? I built my C.A.M.P. on the North Peak myself, love the view from that place!
---
The thing is, whe don't even need human NPC's. Other humanoids would fit perfectly. Like Ghouls or Harold the living tree from FO3.
---
I wish this was the norm in gaming, absolutely awesome dude! Thanks for sharing this.
---
I wish they'd get rid of PvP altogether. I'm sick of people trying to kill me for no reason and taking the materials I've worked to get.  Especially after making a workshop and building everything only to have somebody attack you for a few caps. It's pretty lame. 
---
This must be one of the best (if not THE best) post i’ve seen here! Did not know that so many places exist in the real world! Never been to the states, but now i want to see WV for real. Amazing! 👍
---
I downvoted because I'm a sheep and I have that herd mentality, while some of the replies here had no reason to be downvoted.
---
I can't help the sheep within me!!!
---
Not worth the bullets IMO. Haven’t seen one nuke drop this entire week hopping multi servers. It’s more rewarding doing Teck White Springs or Uranium Fever. 
---
You on PC? How much do you charge?
---
Get a good legendary weapon for those.  I have a bloodied deathclaw and a TSE weapon. 
---
The water park, mt Blair, tanagra town, the space station, and maybe the sattle lights, I think these could all be cool places to nuke and maybe have a reason to nuke them 
---
Just not worth it IMO. 
---
Commenting for later retrieval.  
---
Go to west tek
---
Take long to kill higher levels and hordes?
---
Please god no. 
---
I like designing my home and if I had no stash, where would I put all my Junk to make my home a reality? 
---
I found gouls where easy to kill however most of the other mobs where a pain to kill the only thing that kept me going was the vampire effect and chems 
---
i just want some more customisation for the excavator armour and all of those damn spotlights to serve some purpose
---
Ya I'm concerned I can't dish out dmg like 2H builds
---
Check your level.   It will unequip if you are lower than the level of the piece.
---
Yeah i switched 2h after that just cause of the damage output you can get with unyielding armour and whatever the effect is on your weapon where the lower your health the higher damage you do. 
---
I’m not crying...it’s just rain...
---
Fist weapons seem to be a good option. Atm they are glitched and gain a bonus from both one handed and iron fist perk cards making for some decent numbers if you run 15 str
---
My camp is build into a tight space and I wanted to avoid this option but still that's what I am gonna do . Thanks 
---
There is always a legendary wendingo on the top floor of the Watoga Medical Center.  Lots of Stims as well and not many enemies to fight off.  
---
The issue I have with nuking WS is there isn’t the best flora to farm (violet and cobalt) unless you get far enough to the east to include the railroad tracks.  There’s a bunch of them (neutron pods) south of the train station by the energy station. 
---
Dude nice! Makes me want to use mine more!
---
Saw a lowbie being sick so i gave him 5 stims 5 disease cures and a clean nuka outfit and bottlecap glasses. And he was feeling much better! I Felt like a random event trader ..
---
Yeah, many enemies are bullet spongy as hell. That's Bethesdas idea of "Balancing"
---
Does this mean I can finally display bobble heads? 
---
People are truly disgusting! I'm sorry for your troubles... 
---
If your talking about the under-armor BoS stuff like the knight and officer suits then your in luck, last patch phased them out of vendors but they still spawn in the cranberry bog at any of plan spawn points. Just server hop and i almost always find either a BoS knight or a BoS officer under-armor.
---
If you want the regular BoS gear like the scribe fashion and over armor stuff the your best bet is doing the repeatable quest forbidden knowledge
---
No. You can get a BoS jumpsuit, like the green mechanic jumpsuit, from doing savage divide events. 
---
Yeah one of the complaints with the cryptids is that the loot tends to be hot garbage. 
---
Blade of Bassett, I hear, is pretty good at the higher levels. Powerfists are good. 
---
I have an assaultron blade that gets the job done. For one handed weapons you gotta find one with faster swing speed. That'll make it compete with two handers. 
---
The lever action is sad.
---
I couldnt be mad at the other because I knew it was coming I just didnt think id get bated that easily. Though the mocking hit a cord with me lol.
---
It's awesome, I play it every day 🙏🦇
---
Pretty sure I'm not wrong for thinking that legendaries are necessary instead of being a "bonus" to players
---
Do you play with or without friends?
---
It’s not a perfect game, but I keep having fun with it. Read the roadmap with the future updates outlined. 
---
I bring an armor piercing 50 cal, modded grenade launcher, all rise, and my trusty 2 shot Gauss w/ultracite ammo just in case.   I do churn through a fair amount of .50 ammo but it’s all about working together.  The biggest issue I see are too many people focusing on the SBQ and no one is picking off the critters spawning on the ground.   
---
You picked a great time to get it.  I've played over 100 hours and it's still lots of fun
---
I’d say about 4-10, but at least 4 people need explosive shot weapons and need to be constantly firing, OR you just need people with much more powerful weapons. I don’t know if you know this but once you get her health all the way down, it will regenerate and you have to do it again.
---
And today on things that never happened...
---
To me it's because I haven't heard anyone talk about Anthem that the media aren't talking about it. 
---
Media needs crows, clicks, heads, ect so since there was so many people already talking about FO76 the media knew joining in the discussion would get them some views, but not a lot of people are taking about Anthem so not a lot of articles ect on it as they won't generate the most views over other content. 
---
Also don’t forget to use buffs, they are genuinely helpful!
---
It's worth even the full price, been playing since first beta hour, and still love it :)
---
Without, only time you need a group is the optional last quest. Otherwise no you dont. 
---
Would you say it has gotten better since the beta?
---
Ive tried a few times in my 95 levels and in my opinion she just ain’t worth it. I get way more caps selling the stuff from White Springs and West Tek plus I don’t lose a gazzilion bullets. Haven’t seen one nuke all week anyway. 
---
A "LOT" better, but the bugs that has been in it earlier never really bothered me, i just worked around them or adjusted to them :)
---
I just dropped 7K 5mm that's been accumulating in my stash. 3K is q fairly small number 
---
It has issues, but it certainly is!
---
Allright, well done Bethesda. This made me chuckle actually.
---
Oh, okay
---
Funny because the previous comment called people like you the herd mentality, while proving they were by downvoting you for just being honest. 
---
I have a 1* furious buzz blade. Before they broke adrenal reaction it was a monster. 
---
Right now my 1* bloodied buzz blade is the monster.  
---
I'd love to find one with limb damage and/or blocking 
---
Aim for the head when she lands!! I did a lot of damage to her yesterday and we made it out alive! 
---
It really depends on what you like to do.  I love exploring and this game has tons of things to explored.  They have fixed a lot of bugs and are continuously working on more.  For an idea of what's to come read this:  https://bethesda.net/community/topic/324473/100-days-roadmap-for-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
Hey me too. Spent a good 15-20 minutes looking through the dictionary to confirm overmatching was the only possibility. Never did a launch before but players stole it at the last minute. It’s good to know I’m not the only one who doesn’t just look them up. It’s actually a really fun game concept wish more people would do it honestly instead of snagging others launches. I guess I’ll have to try again when I regain some faith in humanity. 
---
Some of this is not true.  Explosive damage on the queen is just a small amount of extra damage and not necessary.  She also regens at half health, initially, not all the way down.
---
I had no idea that perk also raises damage, are you serious?
---
Back when people overreacted over a bag they forgot even came with the game 
---
Just to add - The perk that damages glowing ones is especially useful if your Solo in the area combined with a Ghoul dmg weapon you'll hit those ghouls like a Train 
---
The health thing I corrected, but in my experience 4 guys, with explosive two shots killed her fairly quick, so that part is true. At least in my experience.
---
BE BLINDED BY MY GIMP GLORY WITH MY MOLEY CLAW
---
Seriously, would love the fog lights to shine too.
---
I also said, OR have more powerful weapons.
---
Completely agree with you gulpers ain’t the greatest too
---
My experience is that placing the nuke north of FSP, trying to fight her outside of the blast zone, she is more likely to glitch out. 
---
Monster Mash is the best event to get legendaries in my opinion .  I’m pretty sure you’re guaranteed one for participating, typically there are 2-3 legendary enemies that spawn,  and every 5k candy you bank you get a legendary.
---
My lever action is TSE and my axe is a 3star grognak axe. 
---
There are things that need to be fixed and BGS is doing that, but the big thing is, with all the hate about this game dont think about that, play it and make the decision for yourself. I, like may others here, enjoy the game and are waiting for the 12th to come for the 1st part of the DLC.
---
Yeah. It’s not about the turrets. I’d like to have one or two,  it is also like more than 4 dang neon letters. 
---
I was about to write up something similar bravo sir. 
---
Nope
---
Stress from living in a post apocalyptic world...
---
I always like giving MATN a little looksie
---
I don't run around with loads of junk on me. Only stuff that I'm not bothered about losing. 
---
You can already ignore the attackers and let them take it, its literally the same thing as OP's suggestion.  All it would do is save the attacking team a minute.
---
Thanks for the offer!
---
Dissagree.
---
I think the problem is her Fight sequence and the mechanics behind it need improving , give her more damage output make her Dangerous and vary the tactics she uses allowing the player to play a tactical fight rather than shoot her as she's flying in circles. 
---
Watching he fly in circles for 15 mins between a landing and her catching aggro off a lone Supermutant 10 miles away is fustrating.
---
That would be the Two Shot modifier.
---
Don't know, but probably 
---
You can still be one shot if your perk cards, mutations, consumables etc all align. I would probably be able to one shot you with a melee weapon at level 49. It's about the build. Did the shots explode? That explosive lever action is a beast. Sorry it happened to you. Gankers are boring but I don't think it's something that happens that often. 
---
Uranium fever has a 0.25% chance of dropping jumpsuit outfit plans at once (BoS, Whistespring), and when it happens you get them all at once. Not sure about the second question.
---
Explosive effect is still good, adds 45% to base damage, better than most legendary effects. Instigating explosive lever action is a great gun, man! Definitely go with that one.
---
Would have been nice if we could place weapons on shelves as well, but I presume that's asking too much. 
---
Anthem is getting slammed, and rightly so. Just like fo76.
---
Okay thank you. I’ll keep at it then. 
---
Yeah I store what I wanted to keep that was extra stuff. I knew it was coming just didnt expect to be dupped then mocked. I assumed a shoot out
---
Well hold on, all they've said so far is "Items from your STASH". That could be weapons too.
---
Not nice.
---
Yea it’s never happened to me
---
More camp budget   and give us a workaround 
---
for getting the military ID
---
the obstacle course   and gun range is hell on us that can no 
---
longer do platform like quests due  to disability
---
Wouldn't that be good 😊 I loved having on my guns on racks and shelves in fo4.
---
I’m thinking I want either a bloodied, furious, or anti-armor blade with +1 st and limb damage. 
---
Bos armor found in glassed caverns on taggerdys body...... is a great balanced armor. 
---
Riflegaming has some pretty good fo76 content like which nuke sites are the best and showcasing stupid op builds
---
Np. I saw some legendary pistol I could upgrade and wondered if anything else could
---
Ultimately I think 1000 is the perfect number.  800 is acceptable though
---
I’m over 200 hours and I still stumble across stuff I hadn’t seen it’s been fun the whole time 
---
Contact Bethesda accounts are saved on thier servers
---
Yea I guess but dam it would of pissed me off to no end... im short tempered tho lol what platform are you on?
---
We also need stronger Turrets.... Seriously with the amount of what we can put up now, we can only “reasonably live” in one corner of the map.
---
We don’t have strong enough Turrets to deal with most encounters elsewhere 
---
Ill be getting on in a 2hr ish just add me with a.message that your from reddit
---
Ps4
---
TIL work blocked imgur this morning.
---
Furious should be the best but it's still broken. I'm saving a furious just incase they fix it.
---
Thanks for the info :D
---
Stop being such a carebear. It is actually a pvp game, embrace that fact and empower yourself. I regulalry check the map to see who is near me, last night a level 120 with a bounty on him tried to sneak up on me but soon backed off when he realised i was aware of him. 
---
The days of giving randoms stuff have passed. We evolved, now we put the extra stuff we have into the Overseer's caches and let the noobs take what they need at their leisure.
---
Not many use their mics and I'd estimate at least 1/4 of those who do are trying to take advantage of and/or trick noobs into PvP. 
---
I rolled a new toon and was surprised at the only two interactions I had with other players being one-hit killers. Both 'chatted' me up before slaying. One of them I didn't even reply as I was in a computer terminal reading for a quest, he still talked softly and talked like he wanted to help me. 
---
If you sincerely want to help the new kids, just drop loot into Overseer's chests for them. I advise all new or timid players to simply stop interacting with strangers, as silly as that sounds in an online game, as there is no use to it when communal stashes are everywhere and make helping the unfortunate out very easy and risk free.
---
I always knew I could level up the sword from the Mystery quests, but for some reason I never clued in to leveling up the Voice of Set .44  ..that was a nice surprise recently as the handgun is pretty legit against robots.
---
 But perhaps the Mystery regalia is the only "unique" weapons that can be upgraded?
---
any chance u had a workshop at any point\`?
---
Yeah, that's nonsense.
---
I’m level 31 and all the times high level people have helped me don’t go unnoticed, thanks! I’ve been saved several times when I have valuable stuff I’ve spent a long time trying to get. People always appreciate it!
---
Grahm saved my ass in the big bend tunnel once
---
A nuke stays active on the map for 2 hours. The cooldown between 2 nukes from the same silo is 3 hours.
---
Very cool idea, will take time to make it, but I'm gonna try :)
---
I bough it for £20 a week after launch, i havnt played much but im just starting to get back into it now and i already feel happy with my purchase. The big difference with this game is that its a service rather than a completed standalone story. Theres a mtx store but thats just for the whales to fund BGS to keep the servers running. Theres a ton of content and events planned for this year and theres lots of active bug fixing and gameplay improvements. 
---
The gaming community seems to expect things to be perfect on day 1 but thats unrealistic. Sea of thieves was written off at launch but nearly a year later people are hailing it as a great comeback. The YouTube coverage of the negative parts of 76 have been very vocal but the roadmap didnt even make it in 1 video to my front page on YouTube.
---
How do you come across so many other players? Are you baiting them with loot or something?
---
Holding a workshop opens you up to PvP, even with pacifist mode on; thus allowing anyone to kill you. 
---
I heavily believe in passing it forward. When I was around level 5, back in beta, I went to my first drop. As i approached i saw another player sprinting in power armor. I got super scared. I was about to run, when the power armor guy stopped, and waved at me. I waved back. He gestured to come here. I walked over cautiously.  He dropped me outfits, plans, and a power armor frame. I was so thankful. I heart emoted back, he did the same, then he ran off. I think I have a screenshot of him somewhere, because it was the first kool thing someone did in the game. Anyways, since then, I save all plans, outfits, and power armor frames for new players. Whenever my inventory is full, I make my regular pilgrimage to Vault 76 and give them to the first player I find. 
---
30 days later. Lol. I finally traded for it 2 weeks ago !  I now have ditched excavator ( in reserve) and can mostly use my xo-1 just to fast travel after junk runs / trade runs.  
---
Bloodied build. Death by lag / freeze regulary.
---
Behaviour can be vastly different. Played on a sever yesterday w/o any freezes or lag - first time for me since launch. However mobs on the server would not take damage from time to time. This confirms it's not a issue of the client/hardware.
---
Today: back to massive freezes, lag and disconnects.
---
As much as I apprreciate new content, **the game needs to work properly first.**
---
Probably bought off by EA. Honestly though after the shit show that Andromeda was, Anthem should have been PERFECT at launch. They need a fire lit under them like no other.
---
..just got my "76 Hours" achievement recently and yup, it's been a fun ride..though full retail price in Canada is $80 plus tax so I might balk at that.
---
Server disconnects are still a thing for me, but all else has been great. Enjoy!
---
Is this a fun plan? They release new things only so rarely, is the plan to max out everything before it even comes out so it’s useless a day later?
---
It’s hard to find someone to team up with. I just need to max my perks and special out but rarely anyone accepts an invite. It’s not like we have to hang out or even talk to each other. GT BLUBLZRedeux level 95
---
I accept all invites 
---
As far as I understand the Plans for Heavy Metal armor are broken and not available in game. I've not seen them since the vendor plan changes either, maybe they will eventually fix this?
---
For whatever reason the radium rifle is the hardest weapon in the game to learn mods for. It’s recommend you find an issue of backwoodsman 3 magazine which reduces material cost to craft weapons. After that I’d bulk up on the materials needed and have at it. As for any other gun in my experience I pretty much learn 1 mod per gun scrap. Melee weapons and armor usually take 2-3 scraps to learn a new mod 
---
I do enjoy a good laugh :)
---
Glad to see the consistancy of results here. 
---
I am not sure if this is worth testing or noting but I had a day about a month ago where I left Watoga HS and the event stayed active for some reason, to include restarting and giving rewards after completion as if I was in the zone. During this bugged period, which lasted about 15min, I found out I was not under slap rules and was able to verify this with a friend by having him not on a team, pacifist on, no workshops, and then log out entirely and join my server, then one-shot him. I was not able to duplicate this glitch and that server had been very unstable at the time (lag). 
---
It’s on the official Bethesda forums. The CM has started doing a weekly post in the general 76 section when they update the shop. In the most recent one he said they’ll be retiring items next week and the list of items that are being removed will be posted there on Tuesday.
---
How is .45 ammo "rare". There is shit tons in the game to pick up and easily craft
---
this may be totally wrong on my part, but I've noticed a much greater instance of getting mods by scrapping at the proper bench. Maybe it's in my mind, but scrapping weapons at a weapons bench gets me a mod almost all the time, while it's maybe half the time if I do it at the armor bench or Tinkers..
---
Am I imagining this?
---
Sounds like a Terrible idea
---
How did you test/measure it?
---
I'd love this! I currently leave stuff I don't need (ammo, plans, healing, low level legendaries...) in the stash box at the Overseer's camp, but it would be nice to have my own box for this.
---
If you see me (Lionneserra) on PC, go check the Overseer's camp. Chances are high I've made a deposit.
---
I stated further down that I use the workshops to farm fusion cores, black titanium, and unlimited ammo. Which is the reason to fight for the workshops. Most games thst have PvP is this way where by opening yourself up to PvP awards you better loot. The workshops are no different. They were literally designed to offer rare loot for risking PvP encounters and needing to go defend them.
---
WOW had the same thing with contested areas and the PvP arenas offering high end gear you couldn't get anywhere else.
---
To claim that the workshops aren't designed for PvP ignores the quests given for engaging in PvP at workshops, ignoring the message when you claim a workshop that says it can be contested by other players and to not claim a workshop if you aren't interested in PvP 
---
April is to far away :(
---
If i build Camp items for my teammates, will they stay after I log off?
---
&gt;There are many gun plans I will never bother purchasing, because there is never any reason to craft them, sadly.
---
Why not, like getting a nice drop from a weapon you haven't fully unlocked yet?
---
Yesterday I used about 10 plasma grenades on her when she landed and each made a visible dent in her health. I'd always been wary of grenades with other players around as they can disorientate people and can launch corpses away before looting but we were getting nowhere and I had pacifist enabled so thought I'd give it a shot. 
---
I'm confident the grenades brought her health down more than I could have done via melee and we just scraped the win. 
---
How? I kill super mutants without a problem at level 45.
---
Bwahahahhahahaha.
---
So "Skyrim is totally lame bro"? Ooooohhhkaaaaayyyyy. You're either trolling for yourself, or shilling for Rockstar. You need more practice young one.
---
Everyone recognizes Skyrim&gt;Fo4. There's not even a comparison to be made. If you hate Skyrim... go play grand theft auto? Why are you even here then? The only logical conclusion is that your either a troll, a shill, or a 12 year old that was too young to play Skyrim. Skyrim is at least on par with Fo3 and NV....and bgs didn't even make NV!
---
Anthem is awesome but like fallout 76  reviewers are scoring based on what people want not what the game deserves.
---
Back when I still played the game, I went out to help new players as fast as I could in the best way possible. I told them to quit this trash.
---
Pretty sure I got the wetsuit plans from a treasure map dig. If you're on PC and need a wetsuit, I'm Lionneserra, I'd be happy to make you one.
---
Don't vats her head, can glitch her damage resistance through the roof.
---
Cripple a wing to reduce time spent in the air. Melee is powerful, but can't hit her when airborne. Ways to cripple easily include one gun army with a minigun or gatling gun or enforcer with a shotgun and just go hog wild on her wings.
---
Its all in your head
---
Make an offer 
---
The only good barrel is Endangerol for the end game.
---
What I do when I see trouble coming toward any workshop I own, I instantly go into build mod and start destroying and removing everything (starting with expensive stuff first). Then I switch servers :)
---
This subreddit has been bipolar from day one
---
They are connected to the hive mind, so are able to maintain super human accuracy and using telekinesis they are able to increase the hitting power of any weapon they are using O\_o
---
In reality... fuck knows, I hate them so much, they seem to be able to fire though obstacles and hit my Power Armor always with a deafening thwack. I hate how they can run backwards or sideways and still maintain perfect aim. If this was a single player game I would use mods to remove them completely from the game and replace them with red glowy crystal teddy bears :)
---
Agreed. Between insane (and random) spawn rate of adds and the need to have a couple of melee peeps with OP weps at 1k+ damages to make sure you take her down within 30 minutes, this fight is now a complete joke since last update
---
Something similar happened to me. I was gearing up a new suit and accidentally pressed E with no fusion core in my suit of ultracite armor. My character froze when she tried to get into the armor, the server booted me, and my ultracite armor was gone when I logged back in.
---
Not the end of the world since I'm level 115 and was able to rebuild it pretty easily, but still.
---
In your home? As in the walls are comprised of junk? Also you bulk your junk?
---
The issue is too many unique items = server instability. You can have a big stash, a big house, or game stability. Pick two. 
---
But you can't have all three and the game still be viable for all current gen consoles and slow US internet speeds.
---
That would be especially nice.
---
Really? How much damage does this terrible build of yours do? And do you know if he talked about what particular kind of ghouls?
---
So basically the best thing you can do in this game is something you can do in real life for free? Why are these stupid post keep getting upvoted?
---
Syringers get scrapped and forgotten.
---
I normally run an automatic rifle build and between the Handmade and the Combat rifle the Handmade definitely has the edge on Damage with all things being equal. The catch is that seldom is everything equal especially since we're all looking for Legendarie's, so what's more effective can be a bit of a toss up.
---
Currently my general perk card arrangement is 9 points in Commando, 3 in Bloody Mess, with 2 each in Tank Killer and  Tenderizer and 1 in Adrenaline for damage and 4 or 5 in Gunsmith to slow down the breakage rate. (This is my grinding build with going for a max carry weight, so I'm giving up some damage abilities).
---
Currently my three primary go to rifles are:
---
TS \* Lvl 45 Handmade = 112 Damage, 75 ROF, 72 Accuracy
---
TSE \*\*\* Lvl 35 Handmade = 121 Damage, 75 ROF, 70 Accuracy (3rd Star is 15% faster Reload) 
---
\* Combat Lvl 50 = 83 Damage 75 ROF, 77 Accuracy (Quad Capacity)
---
I have Drum mags on both the Handmade's so they hold 85 rounds for fire power, and a Perforating mag on the Combat rifle for maximum armor penetration with it holding 80 rounds (85 with Stinging, but with less armor penetration).
---
Out of the three Rifles what I've found in use is that L50 TS Handmade is the most effective (even though the L35 TSE has more damage), followed by the Combat rifle with the L35 TSE coming in 3rd.  The reason for this IMO is that the stats only show raw damage and don't account for how much of that damage is negated by a targets armor.  So at least for what I have the 83 damage from my Combat Rifle in use seems a lot closer to the 112 of the TS Handmade than the numbers show, and it's also a little more accurate.
---
One other point I'd like to make is The breakdown rates for these rifles, My TSE breaks down crazy fast, So I end up using it Sparingly.  The TS Handmade also breaks down pretty quick, though it does last marginally long enough to go Grinding with, and the Quad Capacity Combat Rifle pretty much lasts double what the TS does and four times or better longer than the TSE. (and this is running with 4 or 5 points in Gunsmith, and repairing them to 200% durability).
---
Again this is just what works for me, I could change out the magazines on the Handmade's and get better effective damage, but with the Drum mag's boosting capacity up to 85 (for the handmade  ... most other rifle's don't get enough of a capacity boost with largest mags to make it worth while), I'll take the Firepower advantage over the increased Penetration.  Again Just my Opinion.
---
1 - Farm aluminum as much as you can  
---
2 - Fiend some friends to do this with you  
---
3 - Take the ammunition plant  
---
4 - Repair the Vertibot, kill hit with you friends  
---
5 - Repeat
---
We leved 8 characters from 3-5 to 50+ in few hours this way  
---
I dunno, having to give up 3 lbs of my limited stash just to be able to put a typewriter on my desk is kinda lame.
---
*if* they don't get the visceral treatment a la EA which is the current rumor at Seeking Alpha
---
Super Mutants have high armor, probably due to their mutated, thick skin. Armor piercing perk cards like Tank Killer or Incisor, Perforating or Stinging magazine mods on guns, or Anti-Armor Legendary effects are really important against them. It's night and day.
---
&gt;For whatever reason
---
I feel like this applies to a lot of the game and it gets a bit frustrating. I still enjoy the game but this just irks me a bit. Solid advice on the backwoodsman though, magazines have gone under the radar for me on this fallout so far. The 45 submachine gun and lever action rifle don't drop on enemies for me unless they are legendary, in which case they can't be scrapped. Is it rotten rng or a bug? 
---
I'm actually very slowly working on a theory that if you use the bloatfly barrel in heavy legendary areas than you should be able to get legendary bloatflies to spawn out of other creatures. 
---
It was a functional but fairly time consuming way to get legendaries in Fallout 4. Dont see why it would be any different here. 
---
I just keep forgetting that the bloatfly bits get scrapped with the other junk and I only have like 4 or 5 saved. 
---
I used to get this but they seem to have stopped. I know it's annoying as fuck for someone to suggest this, but have you allowed Bethesda Launcher to validate the game files?
---
My screen resolution for my Dell office monitor I use is 16:10 1920x1200 perhaps toggle a few different resolutions to force a reset? Just guessing really. Try windowed then change back.
---
Good luck  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
There's still a good percentage of gaming youtubers who dont make special videos about video game controversies and the likes, they just play games with their friends and put out content. 
---
If I do want to hear about the latest Bethesda bungle I have a few known channels to go to.
---
I’m on PS4 so can’t do that unfortunately 😕
---
Jesus, you have FOURTEEN people to play with?! 
---
I originally thought this as well but it doesn't seem to make any difference where or even how you scrap it. You can even equip each gun before you scrap it, but still the same result. 
---
Yeah this was my guess, too. But my friend didn't have one open I believe. Also, this guy was actively looking to hunt players, never saw them on the map. The rifle didn't have explosive mod, and all I know it was silenced. 
---
I'm guessing it opens up pvp even if I'm far away from the workshop, because I was. I don't mind dying, but getting oneshot out of nowhere without any form of chance to retaliate gets boring if repeated often. Twice isn't a big deal. I need to somehow remove my access from the workshop then. It wasn't even a headshot as I was sprinting, so no way he could've hit my head both times while I was zig-zag sprinting lol. I was also told that there's scaling that goes in favor of the low levels, but maybe not then.
---
Are you really complaining about this. -_-
---
You killed a clown 😬 the queen of clowns now has you in her sights, beware!
---
The Cryolator can actually stall the queen's movement, which is particularly good for when she lands and gets hammered by melee.  You want to keep her grounded for as long as you can.
---
Just depends on how you feel about Bethesda and what tone you read the tweet. 
---
I know, I feel kind of bad now...
---
It actually is. I love seeing lv 1 players first come out. I usually fast travel to their location and leave them a bag of modified weapons and health items they can use at their level and a couple after. 
---
It all looked great until there. If a robot will trade with me while I have a skull strapped to my face and am barely recognizable, I'm sure they'd trade with a Ghoul, after all, they're still technically homosapiens
---
I have no friends, I just craft corn soup in my camp and sit next to my scare crow eating soup and crying  
---
# 😔
---
I spent a few days running around with a bloatfly syringer testing this and found that the bloatflies never spawned as legendaries and they seemed to have no effect on causing more legendaries to spawn on other mobs. It was fun to use, however, to mess with low level players :)
---
Might want to consider a generating a permanent invite link for Discord instead of your personal account. 
---
My statement was kinda hyperbole.
---
I'm more than sure there are some great Youtubers who make great content. It's just not my scene anymore. 
---
By association. You ever knew someone who knew three people and they each knew two other people? It's like going to a house party. You bring a friend, everyone brings a +1. It sucks when you can only have so many people... 
---
Oh, what a bummer :(
---
Remember to use emotes. Greet and see who greets you back, see if things progress from there.
---
Maybe.
---
I for example have 3 star fat man on my main. Problem is, it's 20 lbs. I think I'll try to sell it for few caps. If it were easy enough to transfer stuff between accounts, I probably would stuff it on a mule. I don't know, I do have some old trading partners on friend list so I could try to use them as anchor and quickly dump it somewhere and then go fetch it with a new mule, since it's really worth nothing. I don't think Im going to spare any shit 2 stars, what I can't sell, I will dump on vendors or their cash machines. I do have fair collection, maybe 10 or so, of weightless one stars. Not really sure why I've kept them, but they are so trivial to have, that Im going to keep them.
---
I personally think people are wayyy tooo over expecting the usefulness of that thing. Plus we don't know the specifics of how it's going to work.
---
By the time I get a good legendary weapon drop, that i won't sell to a vendor, I have already scrapped enough weapons to know all mods. Handmade has been the only exception. 
---
Also, when I buy god roll legendary weapons, they already sre fully modded on sale. 
---
There is currently no reason to craft weapons or normal armour in the game post lvl 50. 
---
he attacc
---
And what about all the children who will miss out on the clown show... Oh never mind :(
---
Another post here showed it is **impossible** to one shot a player outside of PvP.
---
That means this player was fully engaged in PvP when he shot you.
---
That means you were in a workshop you took, and the moment he contested that workshop, he shot at you, doing full damage.
---
=&gt; When you take a public workshop, any player can come and contest it: during the time of the contest, both players are fully engaged in PvP and do full damage to the other
---
I’m confused. Are people still playing this game??
---
Damn. 
---
Did you try it in a nuke zone?
---
My other idea would be to sit on top of a building at Whitesprings or somewhere and bloatfly snipe enemies just to watch unsuspecting players jump when the fly burst out. 
---
It’s really not that complicated.
---
Its the same on all platforms
---
Exactly, lol. Just in game. Not quite as practical irl. 
---
LOL first world problems 
---
Yea it seems consoles are plagued with more issues than pc 
---
You gotta be kidding...
---
I always pick up spoiled food. I turn it into fertilizer...
---
In the actual state of the fight since last patch, there are tips, but no consistent method, since the spawn rate of adds looks broken.
---
Tips:
---
\- Someone using a cryolator to make her stay on the ground for longer
---
\- Having some OP melee characters (like bloodied build) with 1k+ damage to make sure to take her down within 30 minutes
---
The human search is one for meaning, and being the last humans around, in a collaborative game, is the outcome really that surprising?
---
&gt;It is actually a pvp game
---
No it's not, it's both a PVE and limited PVP game, but PVP is fine with the workshop mechanic and also if someone can kill me outside of that good luck to them, I just re-spawn and carry on with my day.
---
Or... maybe how this person feels about themself... (Sorry, I’ve been rewatching Fraiser).
---
Flash forward a couple hundred years, and your faction has been forced to move to the Commonwealth and create the Sunshine Tidings Co-op, only to rely on the Sole Survivor for everything.
---
I have the red asylum uniform on Xbox, how much are you looking to pay?
---
There are several main quests line popping out when you're exploring an area / pick holobandes or notes.
---
&gt;!For the raider faction (rosy) quest line for example, you get the quest once you're in range of the top of the world radio!&lt;
---
&gt;!Same goes for the secondary quest "Mayor for a day" for Watoga etc etc!&lt;  
---
PS4, and I don't unless it's got a lining.
---
Haha that's actuallly a good point
---
I just claimed some workshops and someone fast travelled in and two shot me with a TSE from behind, fair enough, I re-spawned, got my bag (they hadn't touched that which was a bonus) then sat on a truck and waited for their *workshop claimed* reward. Then carried on do my shit.
---
I'm lvl60 and never been inside a silo.. Never found enough code pieces and even then I don't think the Enclave missions/Mama basement really gave me much insight into how I even do this. 
---
Unless I just missed something.
---
Exactly what I said.

---
Yes, I indeed had a workshop under my name, but I was far away from it, and the assailant's name was not red colored, if that accounts for anything at all. Btw my workshop (Grafton Steel Yard) was not being contested, and we were both at the Crashed Space Station above it when this happened. 
---
Ey, good for you! It's always nice to stumble upon those goodies in the Wastes, huh?
---
Nah, Anthem is the hot game to hate on in videos these days.
---
My 3\* Instigating Combat Knife can drop a Lv. 68 Super Mutant in one hit if I use a power attack.  Double damage at full health + 40% Power Attack damage apparently adds up to quite a lot.  That's with Incisor (for anti-armor).  But it also means I have to get right next to them, and Super Mutants are pretty block-happy and can do surprising damage with their Super Sledges.
---
One way I leverage their sponginess is with Vampire equipment.  When every stab from a Vampire knife gives me a little HP, I can basically remain "HP neutral" during a battle with them without Stimpacks.
---
Backing up and hopping with my Anti-Armor Tesla Rifle is my emergency strategy though.  It may take several shots to kill them with it, but it will never miss and I'll damage more than one at a time since they tend to bunch up.
---
Seems just like bad luck... you can find the submachine gun in watoga near the train station it always spawns there and also some plans... the lever action spawn is in watoga too in a duffel bag near a holo tape not always id say 75% of the time cant remember the dam building tho... it could also be how much special luck points you have? Not sure if this helps good luck
---
What did a player got for $60-$70 at release?
---
FO76: 
---
* Nice world design, love for details, cool music.
---
* Bad performance, frequent CTD's, Terminal-Holo-Story is not my taste, Quest progression bugs, game breaking no dmg bugs, duping, no balancing at all, stupid AI, unfinished perk/plan/inventory system, dev room exploit, no text chat, no fow slider and few screen resolution options, ugly textures, ugly plants/trees, ugly water light/shadow bugs, long (endless) loading times, no improved FO4 mechanics and quality of life stuff (user mods), same damn bugs reappearing since Oblivion, B.E.T.A. was just a stress test, 40GB+ day one patch, Game deleted itself, no endgame, game costs after 4 months \~$5 or is free when bought with an PS-controller, etc.
---
* Tl-DR: Broken and boring
---
Anthem: 
---
* Really nice world design, dense flora and fauna, nice textures, good lights, under water content, nice water , good animations and effects, cool power armors, load outs, combat/combos are fun, collectable items.
---
* Performance hungry, lost connection and stuttering, day one patch improved no gamebreaking bugs, many clipping and pop in bugs, long loading times, some areas are sometimes quite lifeless, repetitive quests, story is short and meh, dialogue choices are not important, it's not really open world sandbox, no text chat, no endgame.
---
* TL-DR: Nice and boring
---
Which game is easier to fix/improve? 
---
* FO76 with 2009 graphics, 50% of broken/unfinished mechanics and major engine/performance problems.
---
* Anthem with 2018 graphics, 20% of unpolished mechanics, a few connection issues and demanding resource requirements.
---
I like FO76, but I understand the negative press and shitstorms. One does not simply release a game in this condition. I really hope Bethesda's roadmap improves the game. But seriously, I have some doubts: Old engine, ignoring players and must-have-improvements by the mod community isn't good.
---
That is a crying shame :(
---
Someone must be cutting onions near me
---
Run Class Freak or spend a single evening producing Salisbury Steaks at the food packing workshop. Water is so available it's not even on my radar, and I have Speed Demon. :)
---
**O O F**
---
I'd like to see 4-stars drops implemented.
---
Would be happy if they even kept the budget the same, but possibly added a perk card that allows you turrets on top of the budget. Maybe a 5 tier card that adds 2 turrets a tier. Or just massively lowered the budget cost of turrets..
---
Look dude, I was going to write something to the effect of your mom knowing what a low life is, but I just didn't want to be that much of a dick.

I’ve been saving mine for this reason so I hope so. 
---
I just watch the Yogscast. Fucking around on games is my go-to
---
I did. Unfortunately it didn't seem to work as I hoped. 
---
Not saying you're lying here, but the only explanation I can find *(and I'm not even sure, since I'm raiding workshops alone usually)* would be he was in a group, and someone from his group claimed your workshop while this high level player was with you.
---
The way contesting workshops works at the moment gives a huge advantage to the attacker: you can be anywhere within the workshop build area to contest it, and the very second you start contesting it, you can take down the owner.
---
Certainly made my night a lil better, I'm set for ammo for another day or so and don't need to farm steel lol.
---
I mean with that many people you could probably just attack people until they leave the server to make room for another one of you, but it's a dick move. (Haven't played in a while idk what's going on with pvp)
---
But most importantly, he don't give a fucc
---
wow! I have not either! I was stealthing through Harper's ferry other day and a scorch beast and the entire town felt like it spawned on me ...I see bugs and what looks like unintended stuff all the time :/
---
Whens the next patch?
---
The gatling plasma made me question every decision I'd made in the game. I was ready to give up my handmade and lever action rifles. 
---
30 seconds later it was broken, along with my heart.
---
As long as you don't actually move it, it will stay as it is
---
YES!!!  Time for the CAMP Budget to get a boost!  I don't have single turret, but I do enjoy building and decorating my CAMP / Gun Shop.  Increase the CAMP Budget, Beth!!
---
yeh but i just like the buffs of food and drinks crafted
---
The problem with the system is that it’s not well explained in game. That plus it’s one of the few times in the game where you’re not lead by a quest marker, and it’s just bound to be circumvented. 
---
I like the system, I just wish there was more to solving the code in-game than scouring a dictionary out of game.
---
The world online and irl needs more of this
---
YES!!  The CAMP is a big part of the game for me and several of my teammates!  Time for budget boost for the CAMPS!!
---
Idk what others pay. But I can give you 2.5K right now
---
Had no crashes on my One X, but did have one on PC yesterday...
---
And i play a lot :)
---
I'm not intending to stop contesting. I'm sure most people will go ahead and defend their workshop. It'll make contesting workshops more about taking them over and using them than doing PvP without consequences. 
---
Don't worry. I can think for myself. I know *Exactly* what you mean about downvote sheep...
---
I have a 7yo who is the same way, good on you for sticking around and helping the little dude. Kudos to you man, here take some more gold. You're the real MVP. 🤘
---
So what you're saying is that Fallout 5 should be set 200 years after Fallout 76?

Now this is something I can get on board with

I imagine this is Thanos at the beginning of Endgame
---
Ah sorry man, I’ve been offered way more by others 
---
Comprehensive and well written. Thumbs and hearts to you, player.
---
I was killed by a player on ps4 who had a silenced lever action that was a 2 shot variant. I'm not new to the game and know the combat system fairly well so I would say either he was cheating or knows an exploit that is not well known.
---
Do you have or did you at some point have mod's installed ? 
---
Alright, good luck with others then
---
lol I hate it, my fingers are always crossed for it to be posted on reddit so I can view it. 
---
I love this!
---
I'm a huge Beth/76 fanboy and there is NOTHING wrong with playing ANY game 200 hours and stopping, don't ever be apologetic about it!
---
Geez ppl.  The level a players is is not their age. Not all players are one shotting all lower level players and   I had a 2 * that I would have loved to have had at the level I was giving it to. I have been griefed, so what, I have had more good interactions with other players of all ages than bad. Some of you ppl watch too much tv. It's  not like I was sitting in the back of a van looking for kids trying to get them to pet my cute puppy. 
---
This is not real life it is a freaking game and I just think we should share the purified water and multi-stared armor of this game world and not be such shits to each other. stranger danger..LMAO. I am in hopes of pvp will go to the survival game. 
---
My point still is just ignore you don't  have to smack another player because they are nice to you. That is my point. And I will not change my belief that ppl are mostly good and not all are out to get you. Ug. I will continue to leave plans I have already learned and ammo and such at the vendors and occasionally help lower levels out. Thanks
---
This is why I'm ok with separate servers. I can't understand the mindset of griefers. For me personally I find it far more gratifying just meeting people and helping new players. I already finished all the end game content and don't really need anything and so I just seek out people who could use a hand. Just remembered to equipped a lower level weapon to give them a chance to tag enemies for XP and loot. The party system is shit in 76.
---
If you're level 301 you know all the best farming spots

Put this at the beginning of your custom.ini file, instead of what you had previously before the list of your mods:

Everyone except JuiceHead and LegacyKilla

---
You are the type of player that makes the game great!
---
I'm a friendly anti-social, lol. I dreaded the multiplayer aspect of the game and for the most part I prefer to play on my own. The part that draws me into multiplayer is the ability to help lower level players get their bearings and load them up with good stuff for their journeys.
---
My problem now is I'm level 150+ and low level players don't trust me. No matter how many friendly gestures I use. I met a level 25 last night and had 30+ plans, ammo and food I wanted to drop for him. Each time I waved him over he would wave and then run away.
---
According to Pete Hines it is a main fallout. I wouldnt expect another main fallout for around 10 years, either way. 
---
I think the Scorched would like some representation here as well!!

Juice head has gotten on my nerves, it’s too drawn out and most of the content is here from reddit

As some one who worked in retail. Yep, especially if they are stupid.

I am a firm believer that anyone who works in retail of any type should have a permit to punch one stupid person each quarter. 
---
Bethesda likes to sell jokes. How would we know otherwise without asking them?
---
Don’t cheat...
---
I have noticed the free states vendor sells sturdy and heavy plans of certain things (torso IIRC), same for the BOS vendor but different parts, same for the watoga vendor (different parts). They only show up randomly though not every time like other plans.
---
So you have to hop and shop around a bit to get them.
---
All your reflect/electrically charged/unstable isotope weren't done when the aggressor was wanted. Try it when they're wanted and find a surprise. Also, this needs to be fixed
---
Had you claimed a workshop? This flags you for pvp. 
---
800 is workable but 1000 stash limit feels like the 'sweet spot'.

As someone that does PvP, I'm all about both of these changes. Before the last patch if anyone entered the circle around the workbench it flagged them as hostile, yet that reasoning doesn't seem to apply for the build area's contested area. I'm not sure if the current mechanics are intended or a bug
---
Better to clarify that, farming is such a generic term that applies to a lot. You could farm for screws for instance.
---
ESO and OpenWorldGames

If you press start too fast it opens up that menu instead, it's nothing special as of now

Until level 5 they can't attack, PVP unlocks at 5
---
Na, I don't believe it's in-game. Maybe DLC or Atomic Shop eventually. 
---
I think youtubers are part of the reason this game caught so much attention negative/positive. Every time Bathesda would fart or sneeze they will drop a vid.
---
I don’t personally like very many “youtubers” because they flood the 10 seconds of information I want out of a video with 10 minutes of annoying commentary to make their videos seem more relevant and get people to watch them longer. It’s just a shitty YouTube tactic and it just makes me avoid the site as much as I can compared to when I was watching music videos when it first launched.

I cant start juicehead. He says he doesn’t like the game and then the creates a 10 minute video as soon as he gets the chance that just regurgitates Reddit opinions and any news article that anyone can find online. mattyplays is just as bad, except he kind of likes the game.

I also have this problem - the gatling gun is almost useless at close range, as the bullets go outrageously wide. Even aiming down the sight doesn't help much, if at all. Right now, all I use it for is long range and weaker enemies that it can take out in a couple shots. Everything else gets the .50-cal.
---
Silenced Hardened Perforating Medium Recon Handmade is as end game as you can get without legendary effects.
---
Pre-patch 6, aiming down did work with point blank range enemies, such as Ghouls, but it misses half the time now after Patch 6.
---
Yeah, fuck those two. They just create controversy for their own benefit.
---
As a lone wanderer, I find it nice to join a friends world but not necessarily join their squad. You can still technically fast travel to each other and you can still help each other with quests. I don’t wanna instantly be put on a team at their location.
---
The problem is that it seems to be more and more common. Almost everywhere I travel on the Eastern part of the map, someone tries to attack me.  Sadly, I'm starting to enjoy the servers where there are only a few people playing, and I used to enjoy randomly encountering someone.
---
It's a different situation.  Anthem is a new IP, and there isn't this built in "tHey'RE uSiNg aN oLd EnGINe" nonsense like Bethesda's game's have. 
---
Norespawns makes really good camp based videos, he use to make amazing lore friendly settlements in 4 and is a really chill guy 
---
I know! When I was a lower level I was so excited to see someone else. Now I’m just like “please leave me alone. Get away.”
---
I wish them good luck with that. I'm very picky having not paid for the atoms with £££s.  They will have to bring out something awesome to part me from them.
---
Get more combat perks. While I will agree that supermutant's are bulletspoungy, they are manageable with all the right combat perks.
---
It isn't so much about that as giving folks a way to dump the workshop before they are killed on the other side of the map. Since I hit 200+ I have caught people a couple times following me and watched someone else on map head to my workshop and BAM, they contest it and the friend starts shooting at me even though we are WAY far away from the camp. Sometimes they get away with it, sometimes I still win, but generally now I don't bother with workshops just to save caps potentially.
---
Yeah just have to keep going into and out of sight aim till it works.
---
Upvote for Captain Noob. Always entertaining.
---
Endangerol my friend, use it, love it, appreciate it!
---
I thought VATS didn't work on players. If it does then that's a big shame, kinda takes the aim aspect out. I can respect a skilled shot, but pressing Q for instakill is lame.
---
You probably don't but,do you have starch genes on
---
I've def had two new items from using 3\* Pharma Farmer :)
---
Happy late birthday! And I’m sorry your bf was a no show but that’s really cool you met some great people in the process! I love hearing cool stories like that! Glad you didn’t have to spend it alone in the wasteland :)
---
Your bf sounds like a dick. 
---
i STILL keep forgetting i'm supposed to have a bag with the game....
---
Captain Noob is hilarious. He's weapon spotlights are also really informative
---
I believe it's Phoenix the robot vendor in Watoga that has all the t-51 plans
---
I like them both too 👍
---
Also Widgeon TV.
---
And pumpkins, all the pumpkins 
---
Thanks! It was a bummer, but those three others I was in a team with were great people and I immediately friended them before I had to get off due to controller dying. 
---
She's probably dead if you consider the holotape she left at the mountainside B&amp;B
---
the same people showing noobs in game how craft or essential things to succeed are sometimes the same people IRL who helped shovel their neighbors snow and take their kids to help at a food bank. 
---
So the altruism some show in game is an extension of who they are. Some dickheads I know IRL are griefers in game. 
---
Yes Phoenix most if not nearly all of the plans. Or at the least could have. 
---
Do you know where you got it?
---
I’m really sorry I couldn’t log on as promised!  There was a lockdown on E Block so I couldn’t get to the prison’s library.  Maybe tonight?
---
The rng has nothing to do with what you already have 
---
You’re welcome! And look at you now though! He missed out lol you got some good loot! 
---
This is one of the biggest problems for me and Fallout 76.  Respecing shouldn't take 33 levels to accomplish.  Respecing should be encouraged and easy to do.  Imo you should be able to do it whenever you want.  Find a new weapon you want to try a build around?  Go for it.  You should be able to experiment and have fun with builds.  This one point per level crap is absolutely horrible.  It's one of the reasons I haven't been able to play the game any more.
---
&gt; You don't have a right to get sarcastic and pissy at people you try to scam and cheat.
---
mind your sir, we are on r/fo76 
---
The guy was alone. Why I think this is because I could invite him to party, and I doubt you can do that while the other person is already in a group. I also didn't get any message about any contesting, nor did it show on the map. We were both quite far from the workshop, as well.
---
The thing about him is that he finds the game boring now despite all the new stuff coming soon and has been trying to get me to play other things. I tend to hyperfixate on games I enjoy a lot and he just can't understand that. I really wanted to do some nuking, and him not showing up just bummed me out. Definitely gonna have a stern word with him later.
---
Do u have starched genes equipped? Un equip them use radaway
---
I need corn...where is the mysterious factory? 
---
Sounds fun! Just shoot me a message on PSN whenever you're ready! :D 
---
Yeah! Getting three Grognak's Axes really surprised me, especially when all three are really useful. 
---
Haha I know 😂 screws, plastic and springs.. the never ending search. Oh and violet flux..
---
Partially because last year at Christmas, we all had a great time uniting against EA and BF2 Star Wars. We wanted more but there wasn't a clear big baddie :(
---
And this represents trying to do his job, and he's being impeded in that and in giving service to those of us who are actually using the product by a bunch of trolls who've never even bought the game. And even those that have bought the game don't play it anymore yet are bogging down service reps with bulshit
---
It’s at 20%. Which is enough for Nerd Rage and Serendipity to proc. If you’re stealthy, then the low health isn’t an issue cause you don’t get shot. Makes sense right? 250 and 500 is cute for a semi auto weapon. Never mind the almost 400 Damage, 800 from Sneak and a firerate that spits out about 9000 Damage from a full clip in 7 seconds. Yeah, Bloodied isn’t supposed to be in open combat, I thought you were sneaky?  But yeah, you’re doing /something/ good I guess? 
---
What do you mean by “players stole it at the last minute”? 
---
Or just have them break less, maybe.
---
Thank you for linking that. Seems like I'll have to check back early next week to see what they're removing.
---
It's very punk rock of you/you all ... per Joe Strummer of The Clash before he passed:
---
"In fact, punk rock means exemplary manners to your fellow human being. Fuck being an asshole, what you pussies thought it was twenty years ago."
---
and
---
" Without people you're nothing."
---
We/gamers do have an opportunity, as the OP proved and in my opinion; obligation to help one another and we CAN make a difference even if just a little at a time.
---
Find me on Xbox (mention the OP's post), love to roam around as a gang with you all leaving a trail of random acts of gamer kindness.
---
Sorry for the rant. \*embarrassedly steps down from soap box, leaves legendary megaphone\*  behind for another gamer to find\* 
---
Norespqwns is the only one I care about, his camo builds are great
---
Yep I'm 400hours
---
Before Patch 5 leader bobbleheads were stackable
---
Serums give you mutations, they don’t cure them.  Get in a rad shower and clear them all and then buy the serums for the ones you want.
---
I actually never played morrowind. So I don’t have anything to base an opinion off of concerning that particular game
---
Oh for sure If I hadn’t seen someone post here how to do it with the whiteboards example I wouldn’t even have been able to do it at all.
---
I’ll test this! Thank you for sharing. 
---
Unless you're server hoping, in which case sometimes it will just disappear. Went into storage but it was still a pain putting stuff back where it was supposed to be.
---
That’s just proof of why the event isn’t working as intended sadly
---
That unfortunately really doesn't matter much to consumers if they enjoy the product. They'll supress that information because of escapism. It's understandable, in a way.
---
I have the plans for the submachine gun and I run the spawns when I can, I just never get the mods I need to make the gun worth using
---
Yeah, the EA circle jerk is out of control 
---
Well now. That’s definitely an interesting bug. I doubt I could replicate it, but it’s good information about possible other (bugged) reasons you might have full PVP enabled with someone. That one’s pretty messed up actually, but also sounds rather unique. However, noted for future consideration. 
---
This is the truth every time I’m in the bog mutated fern tea n cranberry pie n juice are always on my gathering list 
---
I could have sworn they do, but now that I’m thinking about it you might be right. I’m either case I’ve tried curing them with radaway
---
Shilling for Rockstar, what?
---
Thats funny as fuck lol! Good, no one wants to hear the same shit over and over...
---
It' a bit inconceivable to me that the general thought process here is to hail so much bethesda does. I like 76 enough to be here for news, but it's so annoying to see people trying to act like it's a hidden gem or that it's all because of "Gamer Youtubers" that the game is doing poorly. 
---
I just give one to every player I find (sometimes is hard to get their attention long enough to drop it in front of them though). I like to think that Feed the People is meant to be shared, though I never liked the fact that they removed the bug that gave canned stew to the whole server (meanwhile I'm still getting useless corpse flower stamen for no reason).
---
You can always sell it for caps, but that's a waste. Also if you inspect the item is actually not canned at all for some reason.
---
It's never even explained. You switch from letters to numbers and back and I forgot the entire actual process  but I remember you rearrange the alphabet and and do something with an anagram and see which number each letter is and my head hurts. We need a tutorial in doing this IN GAME, cause everything is done irl then applied in game
---
People were amazing to me when I was lower level (Dumping good legendaries, food, stims, etc) so I also try to pass it forward whenever I get the chance. It’s a real feelsgood moment :)
---
Not youtubers, but Streamerhouse on Twitch was streaming Fallout 76 for a month 24/7 when it first was released. Those guys knew EVERYTHING about the game. 
---
Legendary farming, flux, how to farm nuke zones, perks, setting up your character with different armor, leveling, using chems to buff your character. Just about everything. 
---
Awesome, awesome content. 
---
I didn't I never got banned I just lost the account 
---
You don’t have the Luck Perc called Starched Genes on do you ?
---
Never mind, I need to learn to read lol.
---
I mean... I've walked off some pretty crazy shit with stims lol
---
I asked awhile back and Bethesda commented directly back they are specifically addressing this issue!! 🤘
---
They can be overpowering if there is 4 of them all shooting at u at once 
---
Quick tip about controller dying. If you have a micro USB phone charger within reach, plug it into the top of the controller and you're good to go. 
---
Well 900 hours guy said in3 days he got to level 56 but I think he plays 12 hours a day
---
So that works too? Awesome! Thanks for the tip! 
---
Angry Joe is great. He just did his best ever review on Anthem
---
He wouldn’t be red-colored. That only happens if he’s Wanted, or once you have both shot at each other.
---
It's videogame merch, it's basically Primark tier quality. There's bigger questions to be asked if you bought that expecting it to look good to be honest. 
---
I was soloing alpha for my first nuke attempt and got stuck at the part about repairing mainframes didn’t realize why my only prompt was to use the workbench. So as I finally finish that part a group of three don’t know if they were together or not showed up and “ helped” clear enemies then as soon as I put in my keycard they kept using the code input pad so that I couldn’t don’t know why.. then finally they give that up and stand in front of the launch computer. I enter in the code finally and like I said I couldn’t interact with the launch computer so they launched it. Leaving me with nothing.
---
76 released in a far worse state than Anthem. Sure there are time defying loading screens, but at least it works across most systems and doesn't have T-pose enemies flying around the map.
---
Used to watch him a very, very long time ago.
---
But I feel like he nowadays just makes sure he is saying whatever Reddit is saying, to afraid to go against the general opinion of the internet.
---
Also, there is ZERO guarantee you can even place your house after you choose to move it. I have yet to have a single blueprint of my house be placeable.
---
Or how they pushed full price the pre-order and then discounted the game a few weeks later for Black Friday. 
---
Or the the whole canvas bag thing. Where they just tried to blow it off and offer in game Atoms that didn’t even cover the cost of the digital version of it. 
---
That’s the two things that come to mind for me. Messing with people’s money generates a lot of hate. 
---
Same with my friends. everytime they google the game for any question they are blasted by youtube hate videos that drive clicks when most of them are slanderous middle school book reports. 
---
Non of my house was built with glitches either. 
---
The mechanics for workshops, and contesting, are pretty stupid. He could start contesting it, immediately leave the workshop and travel to you wherever you are on the map, and be able to engage in full PVP with you. 
---
Bruh u had a bounty and u had ur junk on u
---
I love my bloodied electrified Buzzblade for crowd control. I used to go to watoga high school grab the mask then find a corner &amp; let the waves of ghouls crash into it, massive pile once it was done. 
---
Oxhorn will be my go to for lore and a good time with the game. Something about his voice or personality is just top tier. Just wish he’d post a little more. 
---
Juice while at first I enjoyed, he kept flopping back and forth on the the game is good the game is bad or BGS did this and did that. We, you, they get it. BGS messed up. Move and stop beating a dead horse. Just pick a side and cover content and be a (reporter) leave your opinion in a single video and stop tagging it in every video. 
---
I’ve started to grow on RifleGaming mostly for the what if’s with the nukes and things like that. The jury is still out as to whether I’m full in. 
---
Wouldn't this make it so someone could raid your camp and steal all you stuff?
---
I was going to pre order fallout 76 but I KNEW there would be a sale on it. I got mine during Christmas on sale. I mean games go on sale all the time during Black Friday or Christmas. And the Black Friday sale on it wasn’t even a sale or I would’ve gotten it. It was still a little overpriced for me and see how many people complained about the game. 
---
everyone talks about end game. You can beat anthem in 15 hours. Fo76 has 150hrs of side quests alone... Games do end you know... I mean play wow if that is your expectation.
---
Grind
---
What does this mean!? Lol
---
Where
---
Please explain?
---
What do you mean?
---
Idk. I love 76, but I could never be that blind. I'll never trust Bethesda after that 
---
But really though, find a high level player willing to carry you through white springs over and over. What platform are you on?
---
Both places are very vague about how to solve the launch code. I could not figure it out until I seen the process posted on here. 
---
Any they probably thought YOU were the loser. Pfffft.
---
She said she ran out. She also alludes to being attacked by a mole miner.
---
Uhhh. It depends on how much raw damage vs how much AP. I’m pretty damn sure 25% AP beats 5% damage. 
---
I stored what i wanted. Before death I had 900 or so steal I stored 200. So they got the rest. I am honestly not upset about that. 
---
I am annoyed about the mocking and about how I fell for such a sappy plow to kill me. I wantes an epic death lol
---
I have checked there many times and this one doesn’t show
---
They drop stims ? Idk don't shit on my hopes shes aliveeeee
---
They are all over the place. Just go look up yoir typical antivaxxer.
---
I kinda like the fact that it’s a mystery is she or isn’t she. At the sunny something or other ski resort near the raider train station in north section of savage divide there’s a body of a vault dweller on a pole. Out of the 10 times I’ve been there it’s been a 6/4 female body and for the longest time thought it was the overseer. 
---
Yes I love building and it was one of my favorite things in fallout 4. It’s my go to stress reliever. I had to download a mod to make the budget size stay at 0 so I could build continuously. 
---
I fuck your ass. 
---
Does’t mean it still won’t glitch out. I have this issue all the time. 
---
The most common error I have come across is ceiling height and generators. 
---
Stay away from sewers! 
---
I’m on ps4 and I’ve been fine this whole day. 
---
If you have a bunch of mats on other characters that you need crafted, dump them on you're lvl15..
---
Huh? He was pretty on point in his last video and completely the opposite of reddit's general opinion 
---
Ok good..yeah steel would not bother me ..i mostly pass on it
---
The can give you weird looks all they want, they'll never have a Chally The Moo-Moo in their game
---
Nice!!
---
Game is still young. As the growth comes the servers will no doubt get improvements to make it better. 
---
I ran 1h for awhile. God roll is a Anti-Armor, Swing Speed Combat Knife. That’s what you need
---
But then we'll build bigger camps with bigger turrets, eventually we'll build a camp with a turret so big it will destroy the world!
---
troubleshooter’s nocturnal +1 intellegence leather right leg
---
Supply drops are where I got most of my levers for mod scraping. 
---
I'm sure they're glued down like any other CAMP item. 
---
LOL. I was at The Whitespring last night during a nuke event and got a thumbs down for murdering Ghouls too fast. 
---
 I used a Nocturnal +40% speed Combat Knife, Serrated and repaired to 200%. It hits around 180 at night and I'd guess its close to 1000 dps when used like that. I used one Stim Pack for that whole event and could have probably forgone that.
---
 I did a test with 4 high level Gulpers. My Combat Knife is better for putting down these fast regen monsters than anything else I have and I have serious weaponry.
---
 Just the best melee weapons I have found, and I sold All Rise to Phoenix for 19 caps. ;)
---
Potentially it could equal the other weapons damage numbers but youd have to land alot of hits and not hit anything else with said knife for it to be effective.
---
A good one handed alternative to the two handed builds though is fist weapons. Atm they (not sure if intentional or not) benefit from both one handed and iron fist perk cards.
---
Whitespring has a good spawn density, you can server hop there. Craft like crazy. Make sure you're well rested, squad up with anyone willing (invite everyone in server) with the charisma perk that gives +5% exp, use leader bobble heads when grinding. Target super mutants in the prison and Grafton steel (careful of high level assassins, they love low level players with workshops.) If you're on ps4 you can squad with me later this afternoon or tomorrow and I'll help you out. If we work hard we can power level you fast. Try to buy or trade for a decent low level weapon in your class.
---
Posh is correct on this one. My first two toons were never attacked, excepting one incident in beta that nobody involved really understood lol
---
I made a crafting only INT/LCK toon recently and I've been attacked a few times. Knowing how to advance quickly and taking east end of map workshops at low levels definitely brought out the jerks.
---
Both were chatty types who fibbed about their intentions until they pulled out the PA and the shotgun with the flashy looking explosive effects. Both clearly had some kind of comedy agenda they were trying out on me with their mics. Both decided to open fire while pointing at a bag on the ground they claimed was full of goodies for my low level ass.
---
Go in ur pip boy
---
So it's purely RNG, fair enough.
---
You can find one at Philippi Battlefield Cemetary, which is on the far east side of the Toxic Valley.
---
The actual plan is a rare spawn that happens in the area between Summersville and New Gad.  You'll find a Civil War Re-enactor corpse and he'll have the plan on him.
---
That was such a lovely thing to do.   My daughter likes to play video games online and as a gamer I know that there can be a lot of nasty folk online.  Thank you for proving that the opposite is also true
---
I didnt care about the bag i wanted the helmet, bethesda sent me the new bag and its a really high quality messenger bag
---
I find it useful for starting a long fight. Sb sbq or Mirelurk queen. Stuff like that. 
---
Just wait till the dlc comes where you can display items in your camp from your stash box, those bobble heads and un-scrapped junk items folk will want to decorate shelves with etc with are soon going to add up, and what if the player vending machines they’re introducing also has to share your stash space?  Sooner or later 800 is still no going to be enough for essentials plus camp decorating and vending. I hope the vending machines have their own separate weight allowance but nothing’s confirmed either way yet.
---
I have learned that when you place a base, try to keep it out line of sight for a spawn point. 
---
Those scorched can shoot at your base from crazy distances :-/
---
Yeah I run a bloodied DCG and at about 20% health it has a damage of 1100+. That’s difficult to beat and it has 40% swing speed. It swings fast as fuck but was considering playing around with a combat knife and just switching perks out for specific situations. 
---
I just wish I had that perk enabled that drops a Grenade on death. Omg that would have made my day!
---
Shoot them in the head. It's honestly that simple.
---
Dunno why you are being downvoted, this is an insightful and useful bit of info.
---
Thanks for that but I'm on xbox1
---
Yeah but someone can steal them
---
Best armor drops for me have been monster mash in watoga
---
Do you have a link for a good rifle build?
---
Sound pretty nice man. Just not sure is all. That’s why I’m asking around. One shotting things with the DCG @ 1100 + dmg vs stabbing something 2-3 times with a knife ya know. It would only be good on a long sustained fight without any adds getting in the way I think. 
---
Oooooh, so that explains why they can tank more than 5 missiles but not my antiarmor melee. 
---
Damage reduction is just too high in this game, it leads to nonesense like a minigun dealing less dps than a pipe melee. They should heavily reduce DR in most enemies, even if they increase their hp a little, just so all weapons are equally viable.
---
Take a nap and get a well rested bonus at the start of every session for the bonus xp boost, also if you have the recipes cranberry juice, cranberry cobbler, and cranberry relish all give various xp boosts
---
Yes and there are shit tons of adds to get in the way during SBQ. Would keep resetting I think. 
---
Ha..don't worry man it won't even bother u anymore by tomorrow I promise 
---
What do u mean
---
There is no overseer, as we have never left the vault.  Its all a simulation.....
---
 I built my Armor set, it took a long time, and I only swap bits for that when I find a Legendary of the same type and weight.
---
 My BoS Heavy Combat has slightly better numbers than my level 35 Excavator for Ballistic and Energy. As well the Dense Chest makes me immune to explosives. As its so good I have only replaced 2 bits with Legendary effect bits so far. I keep my eyes open but I'm in no hurry.
---
You are right, but that doesn’t really affect the game itself 
---
Honestly, I find MATN to be one of the most truthful people when it comes to Fallout and Bethesda. He doesn't allow the super sensationalized articles to cloud his judgement. 
---
It's the curse of us stabby knife people.
---
The only thing I've noticed is that I seem to take a *lot* more Rads from being in melee range of the Scorchbeast Queen than I used to, such that I regularly have to retreat and RadAway myself if I'm not in Power Armor.  I used to just stand there taking maybe 1-3 Rads/s.  It wasn't a big deal.  Now it's significant, like 5-6.  I'm still not sure if the Queen is intended to be that radioactive, or if something about her crop dusting effect doesn't "turn off" when it's supposed to.
---
I really really need this plan 
---
Trust no one. Or better yet trust but verify. 
---
Energy weapons suck
---
Yeah 600 was a struggle..this is definitely more manageable 
---
Mosnter mash is an event?
---
I've spent more on meals that I don't even remember, more times than I can count.  I've spent WAY more than that propping up a marriage that ultimately failed and left me with more baggage than a goat with swollen testicles.  Of course it's worth it.  
---
&gt; So what you're saying is that Fallout 5 should be set 200 years after Fallout 76?
---
It probably will be anyway, more or less.
---
Best to just do without it temporarily and then switch servers when you need it. It will respawn normally. 
---
Need to go when event is going
---
it’s bethesda 
---
FO76 is a buggy insult, Anthem is just an insult. The difference is, that Anthem at least made a somewhat serious attempt to be a decent game,   while FO76 never was intended to be a decent product.
---
Less players with better weps is way better then lots of players with ok weps.  
---
Killed her few times now, if i see 4 guys there i will join, if i see 15 i just skip it.  
---
I can confirm this. Also take a lap or 2 around Watoga in general. I can find around 2-3, 1-3* legendary bots and walk away with 2 good pieces armour. 
---
Like log out of the game? Yes, but I believe they’re adding in next update to return to server to keep control of workshops 
---
Maybe a 2 turret limit because of lag
---
Bruh just become a ghoul and farm through Whitespring at no cost
---
Wait, so this is it??? Are these the "guidestones"??? You found it in the game files? Did it say anything else, maybe a location?
---
If you rejoin the same server, you won't control the Workshop anymore, but some of your assets will probably remain.  It's the reason why you can come across some Workshops that already have a bunch of turrets and collectors, but no owner.  They persist for a little while.  Consequently, though, you pay more when you claim the workshop because you're getting all of that with it.
---
Agree. If anything give us a 50 point increase for the dlc
---
is this all the time, including when there's quests? cause i'm level 100 or so and i like joining the 'defend' quests to help people out and get some more plans. if that makes people think there's trouble afoot, it'd make me feel bad.
---
Actually how about as many turrets as they want, just please dont give users XP for turret kills
---
I have 4.8k .45 ammo in my stash and 1.4k in my inventory... All from trading, crafting and throughout the world. None of it’s duped, and I’ve never gotten banned.
---
Totally! I just won't be able to feel important and show you the ropes. LMAO.
---
I'm on all day.
---
So why are you standing still being shot at by all of them at once? Why are you not using any med x or psycho?
---
yeah, I still haven't had an issue killing the queen since patch. I'm not sure if others are experiencing a bug that I'm not or players are speccing away from damage as time goes one.
---
If you’re on PS4 I’ll hook you up with a thousand for free (switched my build from rifle/shotgun to rifle/unarmed and now I have about 1k lying about my stash taking up space)
---
Your right. Just checked. Phoenix does not have that plan
---
I mean, .45 is not a rare ammo. You get it early on and its not really used for that many guns, let alone late-game guns like ultracite and handmade rifles. 
---
Im level 84 and have about 5k. I imagine some of the people in the hundreds have scores more. Plus, why would you dupe an ammo type that no one really values?
---
&gt;	You can have a big stash, a big house, or game stability. Pick two.
---
If they used a proper engine for this game these things wouldn’t be a problem. Just look at rust and every other survival game. Yea storage boxes have limited space, but you can make infinite of them and build you base as big as you want.
---
Got the bomber jacket from forbidden knowledge.
---
Do Events and check vendors - particularly those in Watoga and Whitesprings.  Players often sell Legendary armor they don't want to keep there.
---
I've noticed that the Irrational Fears quest in the Mire tends to spawn a lot of Honey Beasts that drop Legendary Marine Armor.

Yup, the guy who is handling Bethesda's social media account is totally the one to make the decision to make the bags nylon/make Nuka-Cola Dark plastic/etc

I understand people have the right to vent their frustration at companies, but after working in retail I have no sympathy for customers who lash at out at employees who have no agency in the matter. To paraphrase you
---
&gt;You don't have the right to be shitty and rude to employees who had no input in the decision making process of the scam or cheat you fell for
---
It got the hate it did from youtubers really. At the same time a lot of BGS public relations things hurt the view people got as well. But the YouTube community I feel is the major outlet for the hate. One or Two people start bashing to their viewership and you start a wildfire. 
---
My level 3 version find multiple meds as well. The lower versions didn’t do this.
---
What happened?
---
That’s a quest. Not event. I have it too. I’m talking about a super rare jumpsuit. There’s three kinds. BoS, White Powder, and the Whitesprings. 
---
Main problem for me is not the respec at all..i just need other 4 levels to respec my points (needed 6 at start). The problem are these 27 points to get all the cards i need
---
I rush inside and gather the horde and jump up on top of the hood of the whitespring shuttle bus out front. They can’t get me but I can reach them with my deathclaw gauntlet.
---
At least you had some fun. Happy belated btw🎈
---
Didn’t know it sold for that much, now I want to get it even more!
---
Sounds interesting... video?
---
I only did a heavy guns build and have a shotgun build combined with an unarmed build
---
Still waiting on mine
---
what's your build and equipment look like?
---
Im going to make my own brotherhood chapter with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the blackjack. 
---
Cool setup... no video/pics of the inside? Also how did you record voice on the xbox it won't record player voices for me :-(
---
OMG! This is awesome - thanks for sharing!!!!
---
My bad, didn't clarify! I'd already had a bit of corn, the factory was at Poseidon Energy Plant Yard. They've got like, an instamash etc maker, along with the ability to make fertilizer, so if you're like me and have one corn to plant and that perk that let's you get double the harvest, you can turn it into a corn field pretty quick!
---
No, it's broken. There is no good barrel

Open world games is good for content but no offense towards him I just can’t with his voice

doesn't work. Bugged

many many things. let’s just say bethesda decided to pull a minor no mans sky (: 
---
I just dont bother with turrets. I used to have 2 guarding my front door. Those things couldn’t kill even a small rat. 
---
Combined with everything else that went down. It created a bad business perception. 
---
Yet, people still play it religiously :-)

Can we raise that 5 per month during peak season. There is a lot of punching to be done when you come into my store on thanksgiving, brag about the big dinner you got to eat and then realize all of us working didn't get to celebrate thanksgiving.
---
I agree. The whole point of the game is it rebuild
---
Let's see the new one... always lookin' for new ideas! Also who was the youtuber?
---
The only time I ever pre-order games now is if there is an issue having money now versus when the game comes out. 
---
Some of us are poor :-)

No, but downplaying the legitimate frustrations of people who your company attempted to rip off isn't exactly a great image either. I'm very symapthetic to customer service representatives and the abuse they take as the forward facing image of the company- I do my utmost to be courteous and complimentary whenever I do need to talk to support from any company. That said- in that position your job is to manage the fears, concerns, anger, frustrations, etc... of the customers you're supporting. Sarcastic accusations of bad faith don't do that job. The simple solution here would have been to end the confrontation with simply- "Like most chargers its made of a durable high impact polymer" and leave it at that- rather than opening with accusations and assumptions and generally attacking this customer, and by proxy attacking the legitimate frustrations of every customer that the company did attempt to screw. Though the social media rep bears no personal responsibility for the decision making process that went into that choice, they do bear the responsibility as is their job for that company to own it and represent it in a way that will benefit the company and the consumers. You need look no further than DICE to see how things backfire if you try to attack the customer rather than owning to your own mistakes. 
---
PS4 here. This was happening to me last night from 8 p.m. to 11:30 p.m eastern. I got server disconnected a few times. The PS4 also blue screened on me during that time. Since the last patch I had a generally positive feel about the server stability, but last night was rough for me.
---
PA needs fist weapons, period.
---
Even better would be a fist weapon + pistol, but that may be beyond the engines capabilities.
---
Retail?  There should be incentives for monthly punches.
---
LOL. I'm down to about 40lbs of non junk. All I can do is Bulk to bring the weight down.
---
 I can just make or fix any damn thing though. ;)
---
“Why aren’t you home with your families”
---
Cause you are here and the executives are sociopaths who only care about money 
---
I wonder if I need to server hop Phoenix. The watoga train vendor has a few plans that don’t show often. Can anyone confirm they have seen the plan there post last patch?
---
I have this one! Thanks anyway :)
---
double that for christmas. 
---
Tangentially related question: I've only done Silo Alpha, myself. Are the others sufficiently different to be worth exploring as locations, even if you aren't going to actually launch a nuke?
---
Thanks to people like you I like this Fallout community.
---
Uh.. yeah. Like I said, I got mine on sale. I don’t have the money to go pre order games all the time. Plus if they start out as bad as this one apparently did. So why be mad at Bethesda for having their game go on sale just like any company would? Black Friday is like that. Christmas is like that. Rdr2 went on sale just like fo76 did for Black Friday. But again, they weren’t even that great of a sale. Why wouldn’t you get a game on sale then instead of pre ordering or getting it when it comes out if you have a problem with money? 
---
It's still exactly the same. Not much they can do content wise, same stuff. Go find dead person-done-cool-repeat 
---
Yeah it was a defend quest and I thought they were gonna help me, but they took me down first :( 
---
It’s started on Xbox too. Very odd 
---
country homeeeee
---
You forgot a word. I believe you meant "quarter hour."
---
Bloodied Handmade Unyielding stealth. I hit sneak attacks on about 6 of my 10 rounds. Or at least that's what pops up on the notification corner. I used my furious prime handmade for the first 1500 rounds but ran out of ammo. Had to switch back to bloodied. I focused vats criticals for headshot damage. Primarily precision damage. 
---
I've been playing a new character all week and have seen 4 nukes dropped. 3 on whitesprings, 1 on the queen. The queen bugged out and left the playable area with 6 minutes to go.
---
My only nuke I launched myself I nuked the queen and had 3 people turn up. She mutated with about 5 minutes to go. She just took no damage at all. No matter how crippled she was. She feels 100% like a waste of time now.
---
Ok, what’s your build look like?
---
Nothing has changed with the questing or anything no. Some bugs have been fixed, while new bugs have been created. It is somewhat more stable, but seems to be slowly getting laggier again though. 
---
I'm not sure what is causing it but they fixed a lot of the lag issue a few patches ago but I've noticed the lagginess is slowly coming back. 
---
If you quit because you were bored of the questing, then you probably will still be bored as nothing new has been added in questing wise.
---
When i joined for the first time in a long time my camp also couldn’t be placed, i had to rebuild it (it was stored and blueprinted).
---
After that i didnt have any problems anymore
---
The key to late game for me was finding people to wander with. That and always having something you want next. Just wish the xb1 queen fights were smoother. Lots of loot lag and general lag issues at that event. If you are looking for a group and are xb1, look me up. GT: strembrulie. Spent all day yesterday helping someone I barely know get a good t51b PA set with mods. Was really fun.
---
Yeah that's what I'm seeing too. I don't always have a failed event, but when the group succeeds it's something like an assassin's knuckles drops. 
---
It just straight up needs a new system. Even just a slight variation on the current one would do.
---
Something like collect all the code pieces, feed them into a machine at white springs, it throws a modified alphabet to a nearby terminal, use the modified alphabet on the terminal with a decryption code of numbers displayed on the same screen to piece out a new code from the modified alphabet (1 = a, 2 = b, that sort of thing), then use those letters to form a word from a list on the terminal, and bam, it feeds out a code. 
---
Complicated? Yeah. It’s decrypting Nuke codes, it should be complicated, but at least it would all be in game then.
---
I've been playing a new character this week. Started from scratch on monday, will reach level 100 today.
---
The best possible advice I can offer is, EXPLOSIVES.
---
Find the nuke mine, MIRV grenade or nuka grenade recipes asap, farm mats for grenades and then you blow everything up. 
---
Ahh ok, ty! I will check it out. I’m a fallout player, but not usually a survival person. I feel out of my depth here specially when a level 280 rolls by haha 
---
Completely delete the fo76custom.ini and let the game recreate it.
---
I don't know what you're asking for other than what i said already. 
---
It's a rifleman build with vats emphasis for critical strikes. 
---
Stealth perks for 2.5x dmg 3.5x at night. 
---
The same thing happened to me recently!  Over the following couple of hours I could tell they were systematically taking more and more workshops. I actually changed servers because those guys were making it not fun for me.
---
Totally agree, i clean up the golf club with 2/3 plasma nades
---
Like, all of the perks in your build. You can't really see them from the pic
---
Recently, I have 3\*\*\* marine armor leg that dropped from grafton monster and a 2\*\* assassins explosive 5mm minigun off a regular ghoul at whitspring without blast zone. I will use minigun for sbq.
---
Yep they sure are joining the cool side
---
I've killed her twice for an assassin plasma rifle and 1* two shot black powder rifle. In the 4 kill attempts ive used atleast 2000 shotgun shells. Does not feel worth it in the slightest. Especially since her legendary drop pool seems the same as any other 3* mobs.
---
Crashes, freezes, and server drops have gone way down for me. 
---
 I have thousands of hours in 3D Fallout games and I ignore the quests. ;) I'll do some if I feel like it but building my character is what I do. ;)
---
 So for me, this is by far the best Fallout game ever.
---
[This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8a617db&amp;d=sd0su1sp0sb2so0p00pg0ph0pp2pi0eo2eh1as2lu2l71s72ib3ic2a80ae2ce0pc2lr2a12la2em0&amp;w=&amp;n=) is a build. Not a particularly good one. What does your build look like?
---
Yeah exactly. On top of the fact that it's the "first boss we've seen" and has become increasingly more difficult to kill unless every person in the fight has "god rolled items" her loot table is trash. Lol. 
---
It was in the patch notes a while back, but even with the crap rng they set monster mash to a timer based system and I think they added it to the general queue. This means it is on rotation just like all the other evens so in general I only see it one maybe twice a day. 
---
Bethesda likes to blame players for their mistakes and its alot easier to ban people than fix their issues with the game
---
If you been banned from fallout 76 call the home office 3019268300 and join the lawsuit Migliaccio &amp; Rathod LLP 412 H St. NE, Suite 302 Washington D.C. 20002 Office: (202) 470-3520 Fax: (202) 800-2730
---
This is the big reason:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6HdBplLmuU
---
No, AAA game should have 3 hours worth of glitches that can be ran down, with the whole issue around the canvas bag debacle, the whole beta release with only a few hours of play time allowed at a time. The lack of communication from BGS, the fact they discounted the game to half off less than 2 weeks after launch and screwed over all their beta players by doing so.
---
The fact that there are STILL bugs from fallout 4 in the game, the fact that the "scorchbeasts" literally use the same coding from skyrim, down to the fact they forgot to even change the name of them in the files and the scorchbeasts are referred to in the files as "dragons" because they pulled the code right from skyrim.
---
Basically it is a obvious cash grab to see how much money they can milk out of this franchise and see how much the players will put up with. They have burnt SO MUCH good will most people had towards them with this release. I used to be a huge bethesda fangirl prior to this game, but now? Yeah never gonna pay full price for any of their games again, I'll just wait for a used copy of the game to go through my local pawn shop or gamestop just to make sure they don't get a penny from me after they screwed me over on the tricentenial edition.
---
Upgrading your Starched Genes perk might work
---
Sadly all the same
---
Those old canning machines don't work so good, and no longer make a good seal. Therefore they spoil fast. I'm sure that's what they were thinking.
---
Me an apologist never!
---
Overseer, he's on to us
---
Sorry, I should mention I already have max starched genes but removed it so I could try to add more mutations (health regen and marsupial). I had taken it off to get more though but I didn't expect radiation to CURE my mutation 😂
---
This whole thread is at wholesome. Warms this old ghoul's heart.
---
Unfortunately you might want to look up a bit more about Oxhorn, I used to be a big fan as well until I found out how scummy he actually is. He likes to DMCA other youtubers that call him out and he is homophobic as all hell, and extremely sexist.
---
honestly they should put stash at 1500 and keep your overcumbered weight at 800 and limit camps at 4 turrets so we can have 1 of each
---
I saw two players with a workshop up really far away, and they were red to me, yet I never even contested or went near their workshop. I guess I got my answer - if you got a public workshop you're an open target for anybody anywhere. Really bad lol.
---
Excellent idea!
---
I know of it. What is it does when the camera and mic is off is his business. I’m talking purely from the videos. As I don’t watch his streams. 
---
you are right I did forget a word... Quarter minute. 
---
It’s the radaway that removes mutation, even diluted. If you’re taking off Starched Genes to try to get more, put the perk card back on before you cure the rads. 
---
Oh well. Thanks, saves me some pointless tourism. 
---
Im on now if youre around. Going to log soon though
---
What, like selling it or something?
---
It isn't only when his camera and mic is off, he has a very active blog he spreads the disgusting crap.
---
Will you be on later tonight? 
---
Yes, but without the remarkably easy to hit cap.
---
Something like this.

---
Although I had lone wanderer on for maybe the first 10min of the fight before switched to tenderizer. But the build is pretty close to this off the top of my head. 
---
I understand your frustration, but other players can play their game however they please. They are not obliged to hold fire so you can get a shot off. If you don’t like it, switch servers. 
---
Juicehead has a good video for this: 
---
https://youtu.be/QPTjmdr9rZI
---
To be fair, there might have been more room on that server if your 14 friends weren't taking up space.
---
That I didn’t know. Can’t have perfect everything. Like I said I’m only in it for the lore and that’s about it. It’s why I don’t join pateron or donate in anyway. He’s jay the best source of lore that’s not negative about the game. 
---
Well if I run across one I'll keep you in mind
---
Yep, it was the size that got me.  That Air to Air nuke wasn't terrably large and wouldn't have expected it to have been.  Suppose it had to be if it was going under an interceptor.
---
Yep lol rare enemy and has ass loot should at least have good stuff
---
I despise needy players that feel every aspect of the game exists for their convenience.
---
I always use a Tesla rifle for that reason. If someone is in the way I can shoot them and still hit the enemy with the arc. 
---
I understand they have the right to be dicks. Many people gain missing power in their life by doing so. I'm just saying I dont like it.
---
No he isn't, he gets stuff wrong repeatedly and he uses the nude mods in his game, not to mention as I said when he gets called out for being wrong he will DMCA the person calling out him being wrong.
---
If you want good lore videos look up Shoddycast's "the storyteller" series. They even have a mod that includes them into the game as an encylopedia of the game.
---
I'd probably switch grim reaper's sprint for four leaf clover. You can crit every other shot and rely on honey/nuka cherries for AP regen/restore. Other than that it looks like you got everything good and a good gun. Maybe the other people down there just weren't putting in good work?
---
Nude mods? And I haven’t seen anything from shoddycast for fallout 76
---
I’m pretty sure that is the one from the Order of Mysterious questline. 
---
rush downstairs make a left and another left and chill behind the counter. usually i find a bobblehead every couple server hops. so i get loot, exp, and bobbbleheads for my bobble head.
---
Level 60, I regularly jump to the overseers camp or vault 76 and load whatever I can't or won't use  for people. It has just become part of the game. I use the railway stations for the higher level stuff I want to give away. We are in this together!
---
LOL, thats a long way to go to get that out of what I said. 
---
New content is going to be a trickle experience. You can check they roadmap. 
---
It's ok to be homophobic.
---
Yes, in his nuka world video he forgot to remove it before doing one of the videos and got busted using the nude female mods. He pulled the video now, but you can easily google it and people caught it and have clips.
---
My friends and I haven't been able to kill her at all since the last patch. She gets stuck at about 3/4 health after regen and stays there. Pretty annoying.
---
Normally the strategy is to have at least one strong melee on the team to get her when she's down, a rifleman to take out her wings, and I'm a shotgunner. This strategy worked without fail on dozens of queens prior to the patch, even with a bunch of low level players hanging out in the shed trying to mooch XP. Now though idk what the hell is up with her, she's invincible. Tried her last night and despite having a TON of high levels helping out, same thing happened.
---
Its cool to use false DMCA take downs for people calling you out for being wrong also?
---
Yes!
---
I never knew that. Really didn’t get into nuka world. Haven’t played it so trying to not spoil it 
---
Is it now?
---
What are you 12 and going through the confusion of trying to find your sexuality?
---
You've posted this comment 3 times here, why?
---
With accusations like that, maybe you should try backing them up?
---
I don't recall that one... But wouldn't the assumption be that the one she leaves rebuking you for dropping nukes (endgame) be left after any that she left at locations you could have visited before endgame?
---
Where do you find non diseased cranberries?
---
How are they being dicks? These players more than likely bought these weapons so they can increase their dps &amp; save ammo in the process. Why should they give a shit about sharing experience and loot with you? Maybe your frustration should be redirected at Bethesda for incorporating these weapons in the first place. 
---
Yeah. As long as that leader in a mob is slive, others will keep spawning.
---
I think some workshops have a specific set of plans they're able to give. I always get the same 6-8 plans from Sunshine Meadows and Billings Homestead. I tried the Federal Dump site after I learned the name of a plan I wanted; first try and I got it. I had captured numerous workshops multiple times prior to this. 
---
I love giving power armors and ammo to low level players
---
Ok
---
Yeah, and that's all that matters! And thanks! &lt;3 
---
you cant have adrenalin level 5 on level 50 because it unlocks on level 49. same for other perks. 
---
Sure, and you were wrong about robots as well, but why would one imply anything about the other? Whitesprings is one of the most common nuke spots, especially a couple months back when I first started doing blast zones. That, along with one of Rifle's videos where he said the same thing IIRC, "taught" me that interiors are unaffected, and after one Morgantown run where I didn't bother to check them, aside from one Watoga drop I did, and another I participated in, I haven't nuked anywhere other than Whitesprings that HAS interior cells. Didn't bother to check Watoga interiors for the same reason I didn't bother to check Morgantown interiors. Instead I've dropped a couple hundred nukes on Whitesprings and Prime, and recently, a few dozen on the General, and Harpers Ferry - all without interiors to impact. (Though now I wonder about Glassed Cavern, depending on how one nukes Prime.)
---
Ooh, I have a bounty left over from last night, I'm totally gonna equip this before I head out and find someone to euthanize me.

More accurately  it's like being pissed at Ford for not tailoring the vehicle design so your dog can do oil changes easier.

This made me so happy to read. This is what the game is suppose to be, I feel. A community. You're supposed to be building a post Apocalyptic society, rebuilding humanity. Not fighting a war against other vault dwellers. 
---
Good on you OP. That kid will never forget that. 
---
Are they though? All those Mr Handys? Or because for instance they're specifically a gardener, they can't become a gutsy? But that said, if you get roving hordes of legendary Gutsies in Watoga, why don't any of the gate guards at Whitesprings change with a nuke?
---
I did. Not worth it as a nuke drop seems to end ongoing events in the target zone.
---
The compound was a waste of time. Same for Harpers Ferry. There really aren't much places where you can drop a nuke and not feel as if you've just wasted half an hour or so getting to launch it.
---
Awesome.
---
Hey Snark, looks like you found one of the dicks doing it.
---
Hm. Never thought about that before.
---
I agree. That's what I have been doing since I have rose in the ranks. Some players are real a holes on here and I try to be the opposite. Whatever I don't need, I will leave in a garbage can, cooler, etc. When at vendors, in hopes that someone of lesser level will come along and be pleasantly surprised. If I see someone low level being attacked I'll help them fend off the hoard of scorched or whatever it may be so they can continue their journey knowing there are  good people in the wasteland. Kudos to you for helping that person out. We need more people like that. 
---
The grove just north of watoga. With the trees. I believe Veiled Sundew Grove, in the center. With the green thumb perk I come out with 25
---
I wouldn't imagine so, no.
---
How? Some players like to play fast, accumulate kills, move on to the next area, they're not obligated to help you.
---
I’m on PS4.
---
I never used radaway 🤔 that's why I'm so confused about why it cured my mutation 
---
I firmly believe theycknow exactly what they're doing, and I love it. Self aware people/companies are fun. Elon Musk is pretty self aware, it's fucking fantastic.
---
So molded from scented candle wax. Got it beth
---
God damn the entitlement in this game simetimes!
---
Yes yes yes do it! 
---
I bet the mirv grenade would be best! Or a nuka one. Big glorious fireworks!
---
That’s what I was thinking. I have it currently with hardened and semi auto with the ap extended mag. 
---
Yeah, I used to support him, even a couple weeks ago when someone asked for good youtubers I recommended him. But that was prior to finding out what a shitty person he is. Using DMCA take downs to silence critics is shitty as hell. Not to mention being a huge homophobe and sexist.
---
Thank you
---
Naw, Bethesda has provided a wide range of weapons to use. You dont have to roll with a oneshot all the time. I personally downgrade on things like Uranium fever to give others a chance at loot. The dick part is refusing to do the same, and sticking to the one-shot weapon. Everyone has a choice, and free will to do as they please.  But to me, being selfish = choice to be a dick.
---
Yah near Harpers Ferry, the cliff
---
I'm almost at 230, hitting Whitespring once a day and doing events/workshops easily nets me a level a day. Make sure to rest up for that XP boost.
---
This post made me so happy that im tearing up.
---
Perhaps its because it reminds me of days as a child and playing with my dad.
---
Those are memories i will treasure to my death. Its bittersweet because its some of the happiest moments i have ever had, but its also a feeling i wont ever feel again. 
---
Maybe one day i will have a child of my own and i can try to create the same kind of memories for them
---
I like very helping low level players around! I like to hang back and follow, making sure they get XP then jump in when they need help. I like to give out the extra plans I have, even though they're not usually impressive.
---
How much are serums?  Price for X-01 calibrated shocks (no flux)?
---
Thanks you! I’m a pretty anti-social person in my normal life so doing things like this in video games brings me joy. 
---
https://youtu.be/C_7_mfcpy7w
---
 Oh please, its obvious. Luckily the Western Revolver is the best pistol in the game. My homemade one hits at 98 and I seldom miss with the Reflex sight. Put a long barrel on it and headshots at ridiculous distances are quite possible.
---
 I don't use VATS.
---
Another reason for why I switched to a Tesla rifle for farming legendarys if other people are there.
---
Exactly my point. That knife cuts all sorts of ways, friend.
---
I had Poseidon last week, and as I only had one core to my name, I locked the collector up.
---
Two level 150+ came by soon after and headed straight for it, then somehow were able to blow the collector up with a single boom (grenade? mine?) \*without\* even being made wanted. 
---
Would love to know how they got away with that, if anybody can shed light?    
---
Not that I plan to be spiteful like them if I come across somebody else's locked stuff, but it did bug me as I was under the impression you'd be wanted for destroying something to the point it wouldn't work until repaired..
---
Themoreyouknow. 
---
Like it said it’s mostly for new lore with fallout 76. But I know mozt of the history and pick out the mistakes and fake stuff. But compared the Fudgemuppet or camel works which really doesn’t hold up anymore at least for fallout 76. He’s the closest. And by far more enjoyable than the juice. But rifle and entak are filling that spot. 
---
I would love to ACTUALLY know how make nukes i’ve laughed. And queens participated in. Doing it since the BETA number is probably ludachris. But I loved that with the pipboy in fo4 that it tracked everything.
---
I mean, when it seems every week there's another group of people shitting on the game which invites "that" bandwagon. I can see why they'd reply that way, they must get a lot of shit for something they can't control.
---
Greatly appreciated, sir! 
---
I agree :)
---
Awesome, I’ll add it to my list of places to search 
---
I can't argue with that. There was no abuse or vulgar language used here so the customer service rep did jump the gun. And did not help Bethesda's image in the process. I'm just sensitive because I worked in a pharmacy for a few years and you'd be amazed at the abuse that gets thrown at pharmacists and techs from customers simple because they don't understand the laws or the misheard their doctor.
---
Posting the exact same comment multiple times looks like spam, maybe try changing it up a bit at least.

2hrs &amp; 20 minutes of video, I'm not gonna watch them right now, but I will watch them this weekend.

I can see people finding joy in helping others but honestly I got annoyed when I still played this game. I am not a kid but I wish people would stop handing me high level shit and everything when I am trying to do it myself.
---
Mirelurks spawn in the grafton lake and in the town just on the south end of it  not sure what level, pretty sure not too high. Theres also low level mirelurks that spawn in the cabins near the big bridge
---
~~"They nerfed my TSE that I got by trading some water. That's it I'm quitting this game."~~
---
I used the four leaf clover, but grim reaper proved superior for refreshing AP bar for some quick headshots on some adds. It's taken me a while to build this particular sniper build. But sure, some of the level 160s may have been running around with a beserker 10mm in their power armor, but from what I saw in the fight, at least three were in BoS sets wielding grognaks and Supersledges. Could be those were all stalker weapons. But I don't think that was the case. They were pretty effective against the adds, and of course dealt tons of damage when the queen landed. Melee meta. 
---
I suppose I could reword the OP to indicate that the queen fight, though the final boss, is far too difficult for the rewards produced. Either way, from patch to patch the queen fight has been less popular due to the nerfing of the weapons etc. All in all, Bethesda still fucked up the loot table and the scaling of the queen. 
---
I have a few hours on the clock and since launch to today there has been a marked decrease in queen fights and I reject the idea that everyone else just has trash builds and equipment lol. It's highly unlikely. 
---
Appreciate the help but I’m on ps4. I do have some treasure maps so I may have some fun with those today. 
---
Thanks though!
---
I like the western for the oomph it has but the 10mm just has the ammo and quick hands doesn’t proc enough to compete. I only use vats to start a fight or end a fight. I like my ap for running if need be. 
---
Here you go

---
Cool I’ll have to try that, thanks!
---
Fallout, in no way, has that much questing. 
---
I completed the main quest, killed the Queen, and have a good 95% of places unlocked (with any quests therein completed) with about 60 hours played. 
---
A LOT of those sixty hours were spent micromanaging my incredibly small inventory or wasting time gathering items so I can actually use my guns without worrying about them breaking. I'd wager 20 hours spent holding the reactor site to collect fusion cores, gathering plastic and ballistic fiber, and other errands that serve no purpose other than to inflate time played. 
---
And now that the main quest line is complete I have *zero* reason to play again. The only endgame enemy is the Scorch Queen, and the only reason to kill her is to get better items so you can kill her faster
---
I hate playing online honestly. I try to stay away from other players as much as possible. 
---
X-01 Shocks aren’t craftable, but I do have a few in stock as regular mods. I sell them for 300 caps. Serums are 150.
---
Base location is important.
---
I’m set up between flat woods and overseers camp on the road.
---
A lot of player traffic here
---
Any piece except chest
---
The little pond at the whitespring can have Mirelurk in it from time to time. 
---
Wait you got your real bag? When?
---
Group up with a friend and put inspirational perk on, then make sure you always have the well rested bonus on.
---
For even more xp, eat cranberry cobbler (you just need regular cranberries for this - you can find them at the farm at the top left corner of the map, near a shack with a PA station) and cranberry juice (you need diseased cranberries for this - cranberry bog). You get roughly a 27% xp boost from all this. It’s then just a matter of following some of the suggestions other people have mentioned in this thread.
---
I always switch to low dps for legendary mobs, but if you are letting trash mobs thump on the extractors, I drop em where they stand.
---
You'd hope so right? But they love the whole pvp thing and as it is there isnt much point to breaking into houses. Stealing from other ppls stocked shelves would be more rewarding and immersive so I think they would. They might add a new stealing mechanic and perk cards that would have 3 levels like hacker and lock pick. I think it's a possibility and I don't love the idea but I dont honestly hate it.
---
You still up for it? I can buy it today?
---
That sounds pretty cool actually, I would enjoy that. But it would make sense to have it on an opt-in-opt-out basis like PVP or voice chat.
---
I use the Grafton station a lot for this. I rarely sell anything, shit charisma. I have enough caps to do what I want so everything extra is given away. Low level stuff at the overseer's camp or the two bodies outside vault 76. Higher level stuff at train stations. I even spent a month moding low level guns into sniper rifles and leaving them for new players, with a bit of ammo. This is one of the best communities I've ever found in a game. Good job people!
---
I appreciate people like you! 
---
Can’t seem to find what you were looking for (the original post for item), remind me please. We’re open. 
---
OK. I just make the ammo I need and .44 is easy and cheap. 
---
 At my level, about 70, the 10mm is a toy and just does not hit hard enough to make it worth carrying. I had a really nice one. I can make and mod almost any weapon and I like my 10mm so it was built! But just too weak for the places I hang out.
---
I appreciate your genuine thoughtfulness :)
---
But no, it's usually just whenever. They try to break in or hang out far longer than I'm comfortable with.
---
I used to give people the benefit of the doubt in online games, but I was unfortunately swayed the other way over time :/
---
135 Levels with one character
---
104 with the other
---
Both have trust issues, lol... eh :(
---
Same problem in the past, with me. Sorry to hear that :/
---
Yesterday I saw someone with a 10 bounty cap. When I got nearer, was someone in level 10 or 11, can't remember. As I showed up he said something "kinda ridiculous right?". I went for the kill but just to save him faster from the bounty. I got his paperbag stuff, then I located him on the map and fast traveled near to him, and run as fast as I could to catch him. As soon as I get there, I started dropping his stuff and some more extra (Stimpaks, Radaways, Purified Water, Ammunition etc)just to hear him saying "You got here pretty fast huh?", and disconnecting afterwards :(
---
Wesley.something, if you're reading this, I just wanted to help, sorry.
---
Yep, they're all exactly the same. No variations.
---
I see it more like....
---
"God! It's the apocalypse. Can we all just please be friends and sing campfire songs and have tea parties and give each other tender handjobs already? There is no room for raiders in MY Fallout!"
---
I knot use my 10mm when that target is really and I don’t want to reload the lever and it’s the last enemy. 
---
Skooled Zone has some good C.A.M.P. /Settlement builds. Alot is fallout 4 content but still relevant. 
---
LOL. I got shit on for killing Ghouls too fast with my Combat Dagger. Its hard to half kill em'. ;)
---
The person also could have exploited the hell out of the trap/home defense 2 glitch and then farmed Whitesprings daily until both were patched.
---
Jet pack , if you’ve got shocks and other stuff I’m interested too
---
Did you walk too close to the decon arches while they were running?
---
I would like a nylon bag that is also a charger, pls.
---
This didn't happen in a vacuum though. There's been building frustration at the whole industry. Bethesda was simply a tipping point because of the announcement and launch was probably the most open sell out since battle front 2.
---
that's dumb, I would like them to track those things but don't segregate us for our actions, variety is the spice of life
---
Just to the left of fort Prickett is a dead body that spawns, you may need to hop quite a few times, just spawns the dress which is really cool. I might have a extra plan. Pretty sure I have the hat, I would have to check, haven't done a count of what I got during my time .. I basically hopped closer to 100 times to find the various plans.
---
 I kill stuff with my pistol, a lot of the trash, but high level trash is not impressed by 10mm. ;)
---
10mm auto has a nice quick feel to defending in a 'holly shit get this mob off me'. I would favor a semi auto rifle with a lever build though.
---
I hope they do it that way. I don't want anyone stealing my huge but totally normal and not wierd collection of all the teddy bears :'(
---
If you don't start these posts with "magical inviolable teleporting box" then i can't really relate. I hope survival mode has 400 and anyone can steal from it if you don't lock it. Git gud.
---
Thanks for the info, will go there, tell me if you do have a plan.
---
Ah yes! I’ve got em still msg my GT TurdFergusonn 
---
I use the 10mm no radscorpions ghouls, and small game. And the western on the mod sized and lever and things bigger than me. 
---
The only variation is the loot. Just like it varies any where else on the map. Sometimes you get a 3* something other times you get a bobby pin.
---
#1 Gamers don't have any imagination or will power for organizing 25 players. To those types all the ambitious stuff is a negative. Solo players trying to fit into an MMO is just sad.
---
#2 Farming hate on youtube or other media has become more popular in the last few years in USA.
---
It'd be pretty pathetic to hang out on a forum for a game you hate otherwise. Hate is their end game; not 25p.
---
There can be a lag between equipping/unequipping starched genes and getting/removing radiation.If you unequip it and walk into radiation right away, the first few seconds of exposure may not count. If you equip it and then walk into a decon shower or take radaway right away, you may lose a mutation because the game hasn't registered your perk as equipped. So, always pause for five or more seconds between equipping/unequipping Starched Genes (maybe longer on a laggy server) and using radiation or radiation removal.
---
That would make sense, the plans come from a limited list, thanks for that.
---
If you go into your pip boy, what does it say on your main quest line tab under Data ? Just follow the main quest line until you can't. Most of us stop at some point and go do other things, hunt down excavator PA, build camps etc ..
---
I was thinking of a combat rifle with the short barrel and stock with the .38 ammo so my .45 is for my lever only. 
---
Go right up to the target :-)
---
One of my best memories in this game is helping a new player near the Grafton dam place.
---
I was above it doing something just wandering around and I see down below me a level 10 getting shot up my super mutants. I jumped into action shooting down on the muties while he was fighting them off. I fast traveled away after it was done because I didn't want him to find out who helped him. It was pretty cool.
---
I agree which makes it all the more satisfying that he concludes 76 is a disappointment after a very long and thorough examination
---
They probably just kited a couple enemies to it. 
---
If I do, I probably would only sell it for 1000 caps just for all the time I spent, let me do count, been too lazy, but I know I have been meaning to do it. Else if you need to know where to find the body, I can show you.
---
endangerol
---
Godsend, you and the guy in the video, TYVM
---
Unplug him.
---
Asking for harder enemies is constructive. Also i am ready to organize 25p on PS4. Why do you hate 25p?
---
A game breaking bug is a bug thats stops you completing the game or possibly removing all challenge from the game. Shutting your console down is not a game breaking bug if you can carry on playing after restarting.
---
Mitochondria would be a fitting prefix
---
It’s... because your build and weapons create a HUGE variance in damage output. By comparison, very few enemies are bullet sponges to either of my characters... but I run bloodied PA/HW and bloodied sniper builds. The bloodied build part is what makes such a vast difference. Most any enemy but big ones like Gulpers, SB, Mirelurk Queen are one-shots for me. 
---
how so?  works for me, and of the many, many bugs that get talked about on here I have never seen this issue brought up...
---
No problem! Took me forever to figure that out. I had days where all indie was farm workshops for plans and kept.getting duplicates over and over again. Finally, I decided to look up how to get table lamps, and somewhere.someone suggested the Federal disposal. I tried there, first time I got what I wanted and have just been under the assumption they have pools of certain plans at each workshop and it's RNG to decide which ones you get. Glad this helps! Finding good plans can be a pain!
---
They'll just take the idea and sell it in the Atom store.
---
If you want to keep fucking with Bethesda ruining the game then just go play Minecraft or Fo4. If you're not into 25 player you just don't understand video game art.
---
The VATS Matrix Overlay exists as a mod for T-45, T-51b, T-60) The plans for those mods exist in the ESM, but cannot drop in the game because they are not on any levelled list. Anyone that has the ability to craft T-xx VATS Matrix Overlay, T-xx Recon Sensors, or any PA Headlamp, has gotten their plans from the dev room, or from a trade with someone that obtained them from the dev room originally.
---
your using it wrong, use endangerol to make the fights easier
---
She didn't kill it. In the holotape she says she was attacked by it and managed to get away, only to discover she no longer had any first aid equipment. She most likely died at Mountainside or shortly after leaving.
---
 All the stuff I face is high level. I used to use the 10mm in low level farming but I quit doing that.
---
You just want her to be dead :'( 
---
I had a tech support/customer service job for a while where the owner of the company had an unofficial policy where we were each allowed to tell one customer to go fuck themselves per year.
---
I don't want her to be dead! It's just really likely that she is.
---
I spent 20+ hours building my camp so I'm paranoid about moving it. I usually just server hop whenever I get that notification.
---
The dumb thing is that the other player CAMPs I've seen in my area aren't even close to overlapping my build area. I don't understand why they do this. If it was about performance that would make sense except Workshop budgets are much higher and you can build some ridiculously big structures if you're bored. So who really knows what Bethesda is thinking...
---
Mysterious saviour perk card ? Lol
---
I played the fuck out of fallout 76, new Vegas is probably my most played game. But the game is not fun imo 😂
---
WTF are you using reddit for that you haven't met 14 friends?! Just for whining?! We even have a roleplay subreddit c'mon it's 2019!
---
Smack them with an axe
---
Also his co-op with Nerd3 nothing says 76 like two friends exploring the wasteland and progressively growing more and more desperate to find something fun and likable about this game until it finally breaks them both.
---
"I'd rather replay sonic '06 than this buggy piece of-" MATN/Nerd3 C.A.T.S. 76
---
Ah great!
---
Yup. I do agree that there are issues with the game, but the absolute hatred that they're getting is so...childish? Don't get me wrong, I uninstalled the game, but not because I'm completely giving up on it, but because my PS4 just could not run it for some reason. 
---
Take off Starched Genes and keep walking in/out of a radiation shower until the scrolling text indicates that you are no longer recovering from mutations. Check your status tab to be sure no effects are listed. Relog. Re-check status tab to make sure no mutations are listed. Apply Starched Genes 2, and then drink the serums for the mutations you do want.
---
There are actually some stimpaks inside Mountainside, so it's possible she found one and got away. We also don't find any Vault-Tec skeletons, or even corpses, nearby.
---
Communism detected on American soil. Lethal force engaged.
---
Haha very true ! 
---
no I'm good i'm not gimping myself just so you can get a hit in i'm here to play fallout not to cater to others
---
What system?
---
If you're on later tonight, I have some spare raider PA pieces that I'm looking to get rid of, and I'd be interested in buying a Twisted Muscles serum if it's available. 
---
I forgot to add I’m on PS4.
---
That’s what I have loaded. I don’t kill enough radscorpions to get the barrel and the other one doesn’t appeal to me.
---
Wish all jobs had that policy. 
---
Just did a search for this topic. Still happening today. Seems like it happens more when Im sprinting.
---
If there was a way for consumers to flex some collective muscle otherwise I'd agree but whaling tactics are literally all about getting the most money out of the fewer people that part with theirs easily
---
endangerol doesn't make fights longer, you're thinking of the karma syringer
---
I’ll take 5 shocks, 4 adrenal reaction serums
---
Can you further describe the spawn point? I’m trying by the overseers camp with no luck. 
---
Wait, what if she's the vault tec ambassador you need to get codes from from to get into vault 96?
---
salaros, I'd love to join in. 
---
Like I said I have  the western I’m just not sold on it for now but I’ll keep it to try it out more. 
---
The Radium Rifle has a ton of mods, and they are all listed as learn chance low (like armor). It will take forever to unlock them all. For the other weapons, it is possible you have unlocked all mods that can be unlocked by scrapping, and the rest you need to find plans. Use my spreadsheet here to find out if you have any mods left for a weapon or armor by scrapping before you go on a craft/scrap spree for that weapon.

Must RSVP through Twitter. Filling up fast, put that Nuka Cola down and get on it!
---
Nah, still utter shite
---
It would be super cool if we found her, and got a quest line to find and build up a player hub that everyone wants! Making a town is totally her style lol. To add to your suggestion we need some sort of equipment from the vaults 
---
That sounds really like a interesting CAMP! I'd love to see some screenshots at least, and maybe I can help you with figuring it out. I've done a lot of experimentation with the electrical stuff so maybe I can help you figure it out. I'm on PS4 if you want to join up.
---
In vault 96 there is a G.E.C.K
---
This game is actually incredibly fun, there's just a vocal minority of folks who are very adamant against it for legitimate reasons. 
---
Dude my hat is off to you. that shit gives me a full on headache and if that was the only way to nuke, I'd never have nuked a thing
---
...as a very new player...
---
Stay away from high-level areas unless you are really good at running away.
---
One of us needs to make this an actual suggestion 
---
*Touches nose* lol
---
Just hide in the lift killing any robot that opens the door.
---
That's correct. All they need to do is start contesting, and they can stop instantly. If you miss the scrolling message, you won't even be aware it happened. Then they hunt you down anywhere in the world and kill you. This is a common farming technique players use to farm other players for caps and junk.
---
Just don't take workshops. Of or if you do, immediately after leave team, leave server, rejoin server, rejoin team.
---
I’m saying for fights that last long for my play style. High armoured targets take me a min to kill. I’m speced as a support sniper. I know endangerol reduces their damage resistance which help me kill faster. 
---
We totally need this on pc! Me especially!
---
I joined but i honestly don't understand what to do with your internet points. No contact info or schedules at all. You just want us to go solo and send you pics?
---
For my explosives/melee build I use deep pocketed heavy leather with 2 ranks of fix it good, I get a nice bonus to DR. If i’m headed into some heavy action I just use my t60 pa. Most people prob use pa for intense situations so your exploring armor prob doesn’t matter too much. 
---
For me, yes. I’m over it. Wasting all my bullets for minimal junk that I end up selling to vendors. 
---
I have so many bulked mats in my stash that I often have like , I dunno, something like 200 aluminum scrap and the like on me. I die, people think they're RICH when they take my stuff. It kind of warms my heart :)
---
It's actually not that far off. You don't like how other people play and you want to complain on here about it which is fine but if we're being honest that is you acting entitled. You really don't know why people do this, maybe people trolled them out of kills so they dont give people that chance, maybe they dont have too much time to play the game but they want to level up fast for the little 10 atom points they can earn. Point is that the game is how it is, learn to adapt and go around it.
---
I love stories like this. And this has pretty much been my experience so far. From reviews and stuff that I'd seen it seemed the player base was frustrated griefer hell, and it was bugs all the time. But I've only met nice players so far, and I've been having a lot of fun. I feel like all the negativity maybe pushed away a lot of would be griefers, and that's a plus in my book.
---
It's called a wind mill. Also i put a jukebox near my gennie.
---
Happens to me alot when spriniting.
---
You need to have Adrenaline Reaction. You need to also have had it before this most recent patch. Then once you go hungry/thirsty you get damage for some reason. 
---
 Don't get me wrong. I was very fond of my Auto Tweaked Recon 10mm and was sad to sell it. I made it and used it for a long time.
---
My secondary account would be an outlier then :)
---
- Time spent in camp - 90%+ (sharing perks with my main)
---
- Number of crafted items - massive, since she makes all my bullets and stuff (hey, XP is XP, right?)
---
- Killing enemies - eh....not too many?
---
- Nuke strikes - yup, loads, cos my main launches them, and she tags (while sharing perks)
---
Where would my helpful little alt land? :P
---
(PS: Second account bought WAY after the dupe fixes, before anyone starts that shite)
---
Well hey, if you're on Xbox, feel free to hit me up - Way2skinnyjack. I've got lots of corn and shit so far I can give you. Been looting and crafting mainly :P
---
Yeah they need to make collecting the code pieces required as well as the keycard so they aren’t completely obsolete.
---
And actually make anti-armor work with them. The laser rifle is a complete joke, I don't know how they could have thought energy weapons were in a good state on release.
---
Which power armor do you need modded up? I might be able to help you out.
---
I haven't seen a SBQ nuke in almost 2 weeks now and I play about 10 hours a day
---
It takes several magazines worth of shotgun to kill a single robot, but their melee attacks can kill me in 4-5 hits if i'm not careful
---
Bethesda should not reply to uncontent requests because you don't understand art. If you desperately need to hear it - if you're scared of PVP and if you hate excitement avoid shops.
---
I don’t think so. Usually people play games so they can do something they can’t do IRL. If I want to help somebody I can just go outside. Why should I pay 60$ to help people in a game?
---
Let him go now :)
---
I haven’t hopped on in a while, are they common now? Can I get one?
---
Big bend tunnel is alright. Bad loot, though.
---
Why you there ? You need to go to Fort Prickett .. should be videos on yourtube, but if you walk up the road to the left of Fort Prickett, then left along the cliff, there is an opening. By the way all sorts of other plans spawn as well, but also also sorts spawn without plans, it's a mixed bag ..once you found the right one, you can have your friends come and try their luck, they get random plans. The key is the find the guy with the right outfit. So we had a friend find it, then we all came in and tried our luck, it was a team effort .. the dress is the hardest to get, the hat wasn't too bad, also there is the uniforms etc.
---
The Bloat Fly barrel is op. You can make Bloat flys from your Bloat Flys. If you have 4 people with them, you can create an endless army of Bloat Flys. They spawn at highest lvl25 and give 30exp but you can still get Legendarys. Its pretty cool. 
---
u/Ladydevann
---
Tagging because I also confirmed this worked for me.  We should get a fix baked in.
---
Just change the name to "superior" that will appease the pedants?
---
Running top speed from beeping bot... yeah I could go for that.
---
Head to lookout towers.  They add locations to your map which may add to the storyline. 
---
Hang out in the forest til about level 15
---
Its rng. I've used the bloat fly syringer extensively with a full group of 4 people. You can make 4 bloat flys per enemy. You can also create more bloat flys out of bloat flys. Its random if you get a legendary but you can get at max lvl 25 items if you do it in a high level zone. 
---
The Marine Wetsuit has never been available from vendors. There are about a dozen plan spawn points in and around the Cranberry Bog you can farm. How to farm plans, explore all the locations, don't take a plan that you don't want. Server hop, repeat. Any place you grab a plan from will be unavailable to you for a few days afterwards (i.e. no plan will spawn there). Also, if you are on a team, and any of your team members grabs a plan, the clock starts ticking for everyone on that plan spawn location. So, don't plan farm in teams.
---
I feel ya. I currently have a TSE lever for big game hunting: Mirelurk queen SB SBQ and legendary radscorpions. And a quad lever for other mid game: deathclaw wendigo etc...  I just use the 10mm for the fire rate really. The western is good I just can’t get behind the ammo count between the levers and the 6 from the revolver 
---
yeah i dunno why people say this either. i use it, confirm the armor debuff with awareness perk. maybe its just a pc issue. ps4 seems fine. 
---
I get it now, you don't find it useful for starting a long fight, as you wrote, you find it useful *when* starting a long fight...
---
I appreciate ya young man. You are doing good things in the game. I hope you apply that to the real world as well. As soon as humans finally realize that working together benefits everyone involved. Too many young people haven't learned this yet and too many old people have forgotten it. I am 56 years old and I do my best to help any and all in any way I can. I made a kid a few hundred EC's last night and you would have thought I gave him the moon. Warms the cockles of me cold cold heart. LOL I advise anyone to keep their mics on area and you will be surprised at what people can and will do together. Of course, griefers will always be griefers, and not much we can do about the assholes. Thank the Gods that they are the minority by a long stretch. Keep doing what you do. You help restore a little of an old man's faith in society. Thank you. 
---
Yeah definitely don’t wonder to far southwest or southeast. Just take your time and enjoy. Look into some builds and known glitches while you wait. 
---
I’ll wait for them to implement containers to replace the unfinished death bag and drop bags, and anxiously waiting for real modding and custom content / server creator support because I need something to do. To escape from the grey no life reality I live daily. 
---
You did good friend. Keep it up.
---
I've seen this too! Also have had him kill a boss legendary on a bog horde mission and lost out on the loot. 
---
Yeah it's not. Im constantly dropping it because I don't use it, but it's all over the place.
---
There is a way to surrender - get on mic, apologize for taking his workshop before he logged in, friend your attacker, then quit and log out. The workshop will be his now and you can switch to Minecraft or Fo4.
---
You start from level 1, finish at level 50, so 49 points
---
I had a friend come back to play after about 40 days, he said it “felt a lot better and much more stable.” 
---
But content wise, that’s this month
---
Gt mrbiigstuff add me when you get in and I’ll help you out with some gear 
---
Sad... I guess it makes sense since they're kind of OP with their single shot (aside from reload time), but it would be nice to put different sights on one at least.
---
You're not, it's broken.
---
I need a TL;DR for this because I struggle to read massive blocks of text like that. My eyes start to hurt and I lose my place easily when OP doesn't know how to use paragraphs.
---
I will not rest till every SBQ is dead 
---
I’ve had the reverse lately. I used to do these events and would have to travel/search a handful of spots. But lately the leader has been in the first place I travel in to. Not a problem, per se, but feels like less of an area-wide infestation 
---
No need to be so rude, though.
---
Imo, tracking down the chirping officers is one of the most entertaining parts of the process and it’s more or less entirely unnecessary.
---
There’s another random encounter right by the overseers camp. Load, left by the wrecked truck. Another player found one there and posted for others to look. 
---
Just to be clear you load in facing fort, turn to your left or left on the map?
---
The regional shouldn’t. From what I’ve noticed while doing them. The marker that shows the event is just the start location ie: the first sighting. Then the actual locations show up where you have to track down the horde. Only time I don’t see the points are when other people have cleared the points before me and I’m just late to the first part. 
---
Captain Noob and more recently, Jug (for C.A.M.P.S.)
---
I just assumed the game already did this. Why else would we not be able to pick a server or rejoin a previous server.
---
It’s “canned meat” stew in that all the meat came out of a can, not canned “meat stew” where you make stew and put it in a can. 
---
Best game I've played
---
I’ll look it up. 
---
Super, I’ll be on
---
I swear these people don't ever have their audio on. When they're in one of my workshops, I'll usually be like, "hey, I'll get rid of your bounty - here's a stash box.. Put your junk in there and I'll rid you of it" 
---
No response, no moving of junk, so "Okay, look.. I'm gonna kill you, but where your loot drops I'll stand guard over until you respawn" 
---
No response.
---
"Okay, bang bang"
---
And finally a response "You fucking bitch!"
---
Wrong answer, thanks for the loot.
---
It's possible. I have experienced bugs, but, tbh, it's nothing crazy, and def not anything I'm not used to from playing so much skyrim and fallout 4
---
How much would a T-60 Jetpack be without having the necessary flux? 
---
Got it. Sorry didn’t have my glasses on and didn’t clarify 
---
Summersville by the water 
---
Sell you 160 tonight if you’re around
---
Where are you located at?
---
Platform?
---
I loved my t51b nuka Cola but it maxes out at 225 carry weight and so I changed to excavator so I can use 325 carry weight but it os ugly as sin. If I could get my carry weight on my t51b I would be happy. I love the nuka Cola paint. Lol. But, was thinking xo1 because it is close.
---
Ohh yeah sorry. PC
---
Rip the dream. 
---
System?
---
Somerset special ideally acquired at level 50 - final departure quest takes place shortly after flatwoods. 
---
Yes please!!! I will be on
---
If you use RAD-X it temporarily negates your mutations. The diluted version does not do this.
---
Awesome; add me. GT: Rocky Two Milli
---
 These days I use almost nothing but Combat Knives. Its just so addictive.
---
No longer have that. And the one I got was the vanilla one no effect. 
---
PC. Sorry forgot to. Mention
---
Yeah I’ve only ever had 1 or 2 disconnects in 76 since launch. I’ve never had anything game breaking either where I needed a reset. I don’t online game much, but I feel every online game has connectivity issues at some point. I know I’ve had it with CoD or Battlefield as well. 
---
I am not even getting the areas to search. The notification that I am joining the event, then....nothing.
---
I could accept if other players were completing it, but it's happening to me on low populated maps.
---
You were right. Lvl 3 does proc. I didn't notice such a big repair tho,and i doubt it goes into the overrepaired bar. 
---
I'm not getting the areas to search. At all. For a solid week now.
---
It does it when im not using rad x or rad shield.
---
I want to use them but mirv frags do more for me. Unless I go full tribal cowboy. 
---
Might be your platform. 
---
Haha yeah I didn’t make the second one either they wanted to hit up whitspings lol I needed to get to bed for work. Most likely doing another one later tonight 
---
I appreciate your post and what you're saying but it's a bit more complex than that.
---
Even though i love it taking a shop just to PVP and swapping servers right after is griefing. If you wanted a worthy opponent you'd organize workshop PVP with friends.
---
Getting 3 buddies to gang up on random shops is griefing. RP is supposed to be fun for everyone.
---
So if you really want to troll a shop what you need are sirens, and lots of them! The other trick is spam some build limit item in a secret place so their limit is capped and they can't build anything else.
---
Not sure if it was a glitch but a few times i couldn't build anything at the gorge. I thought maybe there were a whole bunch of appliances in a random locked trailer. Also that's boring as hell but most of you prefer solo play so whatever floats your boat.
---
Is that Michael Scott?  And how do we find you?!?!?!?!?!
---
I had seen a guy on the market asking for junk trades. He's adamant about joining his game he's over encumbered. Sure so I join and he's got this big fancy metal house says Shop on the doorway, you walk in and he closes the door behind you and turns on his 8 flamethrower traps behind the walls on both sides and then takes my loot after I died. Lol. I did some damage to his house shop trap building and his level 450 friend just one shots me with his TSE shotgun calling me a scrub on the mic. Well, I didn't get my junk back obviously, but fortunately for me I only had a fancy hairbrush on me. I will miss that fancy hairbrush. That fancy hairbrush and I have been through so much together. We traveled across realms of Appalachia together. RIP fancy hairbrush. I know you made a wonderful piece of plastic eventually and I'm sure you were the best part of the two plastic that bulked some more junk to sell to a vendor or be stored indefinitely in a stash box. Life will be different without you, fancy hairbrush, but I'll continue in this Savage world. Although you may no longer be by my side, tucked snuggly in my where ever it was I stored you, you will always be with me in fancy hairbrush spirit. 
---
Last time I was there it was a man so I never suspected 
---
I'm one handed melee and LOVE my combat knives.  I've got several.  My fave is my ghoul slayer's.  It's my go to for whitesprings in my power armor.  I just walk through the hoard, stab stab stab, and down they fall like bowling pins. :D
---
Equip awareness (under perception. Costs 2 points) and check damage resistance before and after shooting something. It does nothing
---
Does it swing slower in PA?
---
Yeah I have been hearing that it gets boring fast. Which sucks for a brand new AAA full price game. I do enjoy the Fallout formula of new locations, finding junk, crafting, building, and combat. And being able to play with friends just adds to the enjoyment.
---
If you see a high level player approach you, don’t take it as he is gonna kill you. Most of the time they wanna give you stuff like stimpacks, plans guns. 
---
This is hilarious! Wish it was on PC. 
---
P.S. some free legal advice: You should use the trademark symbol in the title and at least the first time the mark appears in the text. 
---
If the PlayStation shutting down incorrectly upon closing out the game isnt a “bug” idk what is. For me I don’t want this happening more than once, because it’s not good on the console or hard drive. Hence I won’t be playing until it’s resolved. 
---
I.e game breaking.
---
Ah man thanks! I’m on Xbox though :(
---
That is what I am saying.
---
Seems to be random. Only issue is the face seems to be young. So not likely her. Maybe she’s just wandering around until the next story boss comes. Or went to the Capital wasteland 
---
This \^
---
For all we know she’s in Boston 
---
Dude, that must be a hella nice dagger to one shot legendary ghouls.
---
Hopefully we see instanced caves and mines and buildings like a dungeon with mini bosses and bosses and loot tables and blah blah so she will be insignificant. 
---
Not that I can tell.  I have all the perks for one handed so it's almost like a melee machine gun.  
---
Guess I gotta find someone else, happy gaming :)
---
From what I’ve gathered, it’s a viable weapon. I just need to find one rolled up how I want. Thank you. 
---
Yup, the weapons do extra damage until the extra line you get in the durability meter runs out. Also over repairing armor and power armor pieces raises damage absorption the same way
---
Could be. Maybe mama murphy’s great great something. Or ugh... Preston’s. 
---
Unless you want to float. We all float down here.
---
Oh god, you're right, I could have gone much more in depth in the FO76 side other than just showing the different versions D: fml. I will have to make another video to go through the lore of the Mothman in game side only :C 
---

---
MY GOD WE MUST FIND AND KILL HER I DON’T WANT TO HELP ANY MORE SETTLEMENTS!!!!!
---
7400 pounds left
---
You really don't have any imagination for 25 players? You could do it like Dead By Daylight or Dark Souls.
---
Eh, I am not sure I know what you mean. I'm on PC. There are a few of us about.
---
Or do you mean my specific machine??
---
U have patience..I don't lol
---
Pressure plates can be placed on any level if you put it on a mat first. Keypad pylons have never worked as intended - I would use a terminal instead and just locked it at level 3. 
---
He’s not that bad. Tbh. At least he doesn’t pester you to help every second like you forgot. 
---
Yeah maybe a pc bug. I’m on Xbox and see them fine. 
---
I do and it does
---
Nah just a crappy run. It's happen to me a few times. It's just how it be sometimes. 
---
Yeah I just had to do it for the meme
---
Fun game unless you’re a YouTube influencer or someone easily influenced.  It’s a blast,  manageable glitches and all.
---
I know. 
---
I thought that the nuke holotape was her most recent one?
---
Ha, I tried to. The^TM HTML doesn’t work in a headline. 
---
On death we should drop the lunchbox and it should instantly " maybe " be locked depending on the level of the victim leading to having a chance to recover junk when others are around and adding a little gameplay mechanic behind it. 
---
I have seen some starred scorched, but I agree that they're WAY less common than muties or ghouls.
---
Just north of the Overseer’s Camp.
---
They gave Red dead online more of a break than they gave fallout 76. There's actually more shit to do here than there is on RDO. And i say that as someone who's played both. 
---
Guess I'll check out the Beth PC forums. Thanks.
---
I struggled to kill a moth man last week and all I got was some junk and a handful of .38 rounds. 
---
It took me almost 5 minutes to kill the damn thing. 
---
It's ironic because you could just make a subreddit - today - /r/76flares for co-op help but instead you dump your problem on Beth's doorstep because you don't want content.
---
Death doesn't even matter and enemies aren't hard, what are you even dying to?
---
Pc sorry 
---
They are pretty common now, yes. If you are on PC I can make you one and you can scrap it and learn to make them yourself. IGN: jchamlin
---
I know that lol. Classic weak spot for a humanoid creature but they still waste my ammo and stimpacks. Especially when they swarm you
---
You are right, everyone’s different. 
---
at least for me I donate time in and out of game. I collect firearms and shoot in game and IRL. I fabricate, cook meals, pick locks and camp a lot. 
---
To your point for me its exploring fallout storylines and killing beasts. 
---
I don’t want to take a dump on my neighbors drive way here, so not sure that I want to do it to you on game.  
---
IRL people have filters and typically shame and punishment create compliance. In game those filters no longer apply, so behavior in game can be representative of core personality. Sorry it’s fucking game not psych101. Lets blow shit up now...
---
I'm still looking for a zealot's.  Then I'd have a "type" specific for every being in the wasteland.  You've gotta put serated on it and heal it to 200%, then it's a beast.
---
Yeah I don't know what in Todd they are expecting from console (xb1) users. We can only take 50 photos but they want me to buy frames? You gotta be kidding me.  Im really hoping this new picture mode fixes the limit on us. 
---
The part I don't understand is I haven't had issues taking her down with my team since I got my build set up. My weapon is a 1 star and I can do exactly what I'm doing with 1 star armor. 
---
I'm sure nerfing weapons has something to do with it. So far there hasn't been a single weapon that's been buffed because the community has been demanding for weapons to be nerfed. A lot of players I met that had TSE before the nerf still haven't replaced their TSE's for something that does comparable damage. I'm guessing most of them just decided to eat the nerf and hope something levels it out. 
---
And it really doesn't surprise me to see what kind of damage some people do when they're at the queen. I have a team of folks that used to speed run the queen. Best we ever got was 1:26. Nowadays we mostly use scorched earth to get XP from adds and deliberately ignore the queen so we can extend the fight out longer. I've seen fights where she still hasn't gotten to health regen with 5 minutes left on the clock. Then a few of our team mates will switch characters to their queen fighting builds and she'll be down in 5. Not everyone is set up for DPS and I don't think you can expect it out of most.
---
Are you using mods?
---
I know it’s a “holotape” but I think it was meant as an over the air broadcast. Like she saw the nuke and contacted us. 
---
Sent you a pm
---
 I can buy some of that argument, but see, entitlement to me is placing self above all others. That doesnt fit your story.
---
 Perhaps I'm just naive and don't understand how self centered MMORPG really are. This is the only one I have been in. I understand it with FPS, hell, I do that all the time. But here, it isnt as though your get less by letting others have a chance.
---
However, If that is the way it is, so be it. I'm not buying in, myself.
---
Some servers are better than others. Server hop and nuke again.
---
Any Weapons? I'm on PC. Looking to spend some money
---
Yeah that’s true. No one dares throw shade at a Rockstar IP though. I feel that reviewers favor some developers over others.
---
The only thing i would add to that when going Super mutant. 
---
We should be able to choose higher intelligence versus Strength. 
---
As within fallout lore, there supermutants that are very intellengent and docile. 
---
All my stuff is free. Just come take a look. Lots of weapons 
---
600, because it uses 5 Violet, 5 Cobalt. 
---
I’d love to see her warm ya about human and bot raiders trying to break into the vaults and send us to stop them. Good way to introduce the vaults proper and human mobs. 
---
I did the fertile soil event a million times and only once it gave me decent armor 
---
I added an edit with my GT to the post.
---
Sent a request 
---
I'll accept after this trade 
---
Thanks, I'll do that. That's really strange how it works I guess.
---
Thanks, I'll just try another server
---
yes I almost guarantee they are using mods and blaming Beth
---
Can you put mods on my excavator arms ?
---
You'r lvl 100?? I've played 24hrs and I'm only lvl 17... how is that humanly possible? LOL joking
---
What mod are you looking for on it?
---
No it’s not just you. Power counters are totally broken, or half broken really. It counts to 9... not really useful for anything as far as I can tell.
---
The camp building needs to be improved for sure. I see people asking for bigger camp limit, but I don’t need bigger, I need there to be something interesting I can build. And right now to build something interesting you have to basically cheat the camp building mechanics into letting you place things in ways not usually allowed.
---
That's because they do. 
---
Any mods
---
That's correct I got a full set of heavy bos combat armor that way took just over a week to complete the set.
---
Oh I didt know that affected it thanks!
---
Saying what you feel is right is fine but putting down other people because you don't understand them makes you entitled. Other than that, I agree with the statement "Be the change you wish to see" so keep doing you. 
---
I have 
---
Yeah I normally do a round of golf and if I don't get a good legendary to kill like a 3* or they don't give me anything good I just hop servers. If it's a good round then I nuke WS
---
Could I get a quote on a pair of X-01 calibrated shocks and a Jetpack?
---
They completely left out Huntington and Parkersburg, either place could’ve had some kind of bigger area like this....both universities should’ve been more like the White Spring 
---
Gee, It's almost like the game was marketed to be a Co-op game from the start. 
---
Serums grant the corresponding mutation, and serum also suppresses the NEGATIVE side effects of said mutation for one hour. 👍
---
I think he was kidding with you. 
---
While they are interesting, the hints at a hivemind controlled by the Queen makes them somewhat problematic to play individually.  
---
Dude i do things like this all the time. I would stay by vault 76 and just give a tutorial and items and i love doing this!
---
Sorry I dont have the x01 mods yet 😕
---
Problem I have with it is I don't always heal after the area is clear.
---
Ahhh any t-60 stuff?
---
Oh.
---
I am not sure but this might have been me. I regularly get bounties from destroying turret nests at WS, and I will usually stash my junk then hang around waiting for someone to kill me.
---
I don't really remember selling my killer a 2-shot, but I have been known to have a beverage or two...
---
If it was on voice, you'd know me - I am Irish and you'd spot the accent.
---
Ah that makes more sense.  I wasn't even thinking about cards.  Damn thats a lot of cards to need at 84.  
---
TIL an IG comment is "bogging down service reps" 
---
This sarcastic little shit running Beth's IG didnt even need to respond to that comment, in any way. Personally, I think Bethesda's community interactions should be very humble and thankful to anyone actually playing 76. 
---
They can't even keep track of the game's bugs, do you really think they're capable of all that?
---
So the more points in it you get extra meds in the container?
---
I run with one on the perk and find a good amount of chemo when I'm selling from the different vendee.
---
Another problem with the system, even when understood, is that it's nearly impossible for a human to solve before Modus solves/reveals parts of the decrypted keyword. For this reason, I wonder if it would be better if the  silo password resets for each silo were staggered/offset by a few days (e.g. Alpha Monday, Bravo Thursday, Charlie Saturday). That would make it so there was nearly-always one human-solvable silo (assuming it's available). That would be an improvement if the intent is for individuals to solve it on their own. If the goal is for the community to solve as a group, the day-aligned passwords are probably easier to organize around. 
---
I took speed demon off and it is still doing it i have no idea why it is doing it all of a sudden. It was fine for abit earlier and then started doing it again.
---
[No, it doesn't work](https://imgur.com/a/JgHj48y). It's been broken since launch and no patch notes have claimed to have fixed it. 
---
The guy on IG didnt even shit on 76 - he shit on a lie Bethesda told about a product a shit load of their consumers prepaid for. They should be embarrassed, not snarky. 
---
I can accept that pugs have a higher failure rate than a specific coordinated team. I just don't see the queen fight as requiring this overwhelming coordination for the rewards that she has. 
---
It's still possible the "slap" damage is somehow altered by simple things like latency causing them all to register at the same time or something.  Butttttt yeah who knows.  I haven't had an issue with it being "broken" ever lol
---
Lol you gotta be kidding, right? No PA stands a chance against top notch regular armor. If I’m in PVP and my opponent is wearing PA, that’s easy money for me!
---
And that legitimate reasons... YouTube views.
---
Turret camp destroyers represent. ;)
---
Today it took a whole 2 hours for someone to finally have the guts to drop me. I don't know if it's me being lvl 180+ but it's getting harder and harder to get rid of bounties.
---
There's plenty to do at and before level 60. By level 100, I ran out of out of other tasks, and finally launched a nuke. It's time consuming but not a bad little quest...the first time. 
---
Haha I do the same. I just can’t help but think it can get better. 
---
I was heartbroken when I saw Xbox because this is the best thing ever. 
---
Energy weapons lacking right now.  Either don’t do enough damage or break too fast. 
---
Another poster suggested that the attacker being Wanted would change these results. They did. Adding new results now.
---
Seriously, I don’t think I have ever seen anyone use a plasma weapon in this game and one or two lasers. Energy weapons need buffed but so do the explosive big guns.
---
Imma throw this at you for utilization :)
---
™
---
Yeah I have t60 and excavator
---
I'll never forget my first time meeting another player in the game. I was only level 5 or so, and was at flatwoods, low on ammo, and food. Some level 20 walks up, asks if I wanted a power armor chassis, I said sure, he dropped one, and gave me like 3 full power cores. He also gave me some food and .308, because I was using a hunting rifle. I thanked him, then he vanished into the night. I think people like you are awesome. Keep up the good deeds. I hate assholes who grief low levels for no reason. 
---
Iunno, the only coordination we do is we make sure everyone runs empath so we have a good amount of damage mitigation. We're not directing it like a strategic fight. The rewards are pretty underwhelming, but that's kinda why I only do it for the experience nowadays. Plus it's one of the best ways to farm for honey since there's so many honey beasts
---
Think it is my ps4 controller :( bloody thing.
---
This is correct. Electrically charge WILL INITIATE FULL PVP if the aggressor is Wanted.
---
Reactive Plates did not, in my testing. Further information welcome if your experience is otherwise.
---
Yeah I thought maybe this had happened a few times now over the past month of playing and catching some weird WSR Clubhouse stuff with spawns not happening upon reset or just stuff like loot now showing or spawning. Thought perhaps it was a nerf, but it seems sometimes I just catch a mysteriously buggy server..
---
Trap
---
But where’s her body? 
---
I use a full set of bos unyielding armor with my lever rifle build it's great if you stand still,also use it along with melee.
---
You'd prolly be surprised at how much telemetry they gather. 
---
Oh, well shit, maybe you can. This is the first time I've seen it on desktop and I'm blind as hell. 
---
Either way, it's interesting that doing a totally even build is a viable option 
---
I know, I’ve seen it happen. This is the exploit commonly used.
---
How kind! I’ll try to come take a look. IGN teethfacetv
---
My point is this person isn't actually playing Fallout 76. And it isn't just one person bogging down the service reps. This is just one of many, and how many of these are from people who have not even played the game. A lot of the trolls that I've run into later admit that they haven't.
---
Norespawns is a really great youtuber.
---
I'd like to have everything like this tracked, but keeping players apart from each other based on stats seems a bit much
---
I just logged on for the first time in 2 months to test out energy weapon durability and my 2 shot gatling laser went through a whole core without any noticeable durability loss. It looks like they did that already? Or am I missing something?
---
I've ran into far too many griefers. In fact, I was doing a guest, and my level 57 friend asks if we can go mess people up on their quests and stuff. I told him I really don't want to do that. He gets all pissy and stops talking. 
---
I’d love to see more powerful nukes mutate her more and make a massive ugly flesh. Or more variation in her spawns. Lore wise she’s not the only queen as the SB breed like rabbits. 
---
Watch Gronkh. Hes good.
---
Just send a request and I'll add after this trade. Do have a fair bit of people here
---
New dlc coming soon and yes the game has gotten better stability wise and whatnot. 
---
Yikes- that’s odd. Wish I could provide something more useful, but that sucks
---
This
---
Almost no one role plays and 99% of reddit is strongly opposed to doing anything 25p.
---
Feel free to add PSNid Enterres i like workshop PVP and am doing near daily Death Marches - farming route 65 with mic on area for immersiveness. No fast travel.
---
Otherwise just try twitch.tv to see who is online.
---
If you have a deposit of some sort your camp is sitting on it could be just a popular spot for people to place a camp. I use to have a camp that had 2 deposits but over the past few months as players have discovered it, it has become a popular spot and got to the point where my camp could rarely be bbn placed because someone else had their camp in the same spot. So I moved to a different location eventually. 
---
Jesus Christ just check it out yourself. You are obviously following this sub so you know what is going on, what they changed and what they are planning to do. You own the game so just install it again and take a look. I’m seriously sick of all this “shoul I come back” “is it good now” posts. Build your own opinion for fucks sake.
---
Nobody wants to fight her because she's badly designed. She scales to impossible levels the more people are around, she often glitches out and buggers off to places players can't go, loot sometimes doesn't load and in the cases it does load it's mostly garbage that's not even remotely rewarding for the amount of ammo it did cost to bring the dumb cunt down to begin with.
---
People nuke FSP for the flux, nothing else.
---
Yea, ranged means non-melee, not thrown. Batteries Included should affect the ammo weight. Science perks should improve it when crafting it.
---
I think Grahm occasionally sells the plans for the Gamma Gun. I wouldn't suggest using it as a main weapon though, split damage types deal less damage overall and rad damage is usually highly resisted or even heals radiation based enemies.
---
Can there be a mod from a vendor for t51b?
---
Ha no worries!
---
Well unless you can think of a better way to get a good variety of stable flux without getting your ass chewed off by 57 bloated glowing ones (and one wendigo) while skipping through the gilliflowers, only to find out while you picked 117 flux you've only got enough hardened mass to make 2 whole stable flux, I think the SBQ will still be relevant to folks building higher end weapons and armor, at least for a while.
---
And I don't know that I agree that fighting the queen is _boring_ it's that fighting the queen isn't _worth it_. When an SBQ fight goes well: When they've nuked the right spot so you're not fighting her in the shit, when 8-10 guys show up to help out and everyone does their job taking care of the ankle biters and nobody's an asshole and the quest y'know actually ends, and provides rewards and her body is readily lootable? That's some of the most fun I've had in a game, even if all I get out of it is some ultracite, some flux, a couple of plans I already had and a 2\* unyielding +1 luck combat armor left arm I'm just going to end up dropping in a suitcase at Watoga Station.
---
But after you've had some fights where she bugs out and doesn't take damage and you're running out of radaway from the radiation cuz they didn't nuke the right spot and even though you had 30 stimpacks now you're down to 2 because while you're simultaneously fighting off a scorched alpha deathclaw, a scorched mirelurk queen and a scorched yao guai, a scorched stingwing and scorched molerat are magically able to penetrate your souped up X-01 power armor which is steadily receiving heavy damage. And now your two best guns are broke and your third one's out of ammo and now you're going to try not to die while you switch out your heavy gunner perk cards and switch in your melee perk cards which aren't going to help with the queen cuz she ain't landing and now there's only 2 minutes left to fight her and she's still at 80% health and just... ugh. Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
So yeah, you're gonna fight her cuz when it works it's great. But I sure wish there were more large group boss monster fights that go out on a server wide announcement that take a good 5-10 minutes and reward a smattering of mediocre to pretty good loot. And I wish if and when that happens that the fights aren't broken shitfests like SBQ has unfortunately become.
---
Cool cheers.
---
I managed to join a world with my camp down. Had the problem again after, but after about 4 more tries i joined another world with my camp, and havent had the issue since.
---
Endangerol does nothing.
---
Ayeeeee, I like it. I have the same outfit. I bought it on my first day or so. It's a nice outfit. 
---
They are adding server re-joining but it has nothing to do with workshops. Leave the server and you’ll lose the workshop. 
---
I did something similar with the puzzles. My powered door works just fine.  
---
Use the keypad one. I think it's the last one. Put a switch pylon beside the one that's attached to the door. This will be used to close the door. 
---
Attach the switch to the door switch. Attach door to power. Attach other switch to door and power. Very important.  
---
You can close the door from the outside by "reaching in" to trigger the switch. Not the door switch.

Also, I've never tried reactive plates, but I believe unstable isotope will do it as well. There's also intermittent damage done by plague walker, but I haven't tested whether it's slap damage or full damage. It might be best to test this with strange in numbers since that should amplify the damage it does. If you need some serums to test this and you're on PC, I'd gladly help out
---
Yes especially with the upcoming updates soon.
---
Dude for real? How many  aluminon to repair and how many xp per kill? 
---
Awesome! I'll add you and be on in about an hour or so. 
---
Well, this new one I got 2 3* and a 2*, and a few random legendaries on the non nuked round, guess I'll try this one and see how it goes =). Really strange how that works, that it's based on the spawns before you nuke. Good to know though.
---
Don't buy Atom.
---
I spent 3 hours last night launching my first nuke, which I did solo and without looking up codes. Decided to nuke white springs and got there..only. A couple one star legendaries and that was it... waited about 30 minutes and the mobs never respawned. It was super disappointing and I was wondering what the deal was, but if it’s random I’ll just try again too.
---
Anyone on Xbox who buys a pose, emote, or frame is an idiot. You can only take 15 photos. That's it.
---
&gt; We know she’s alive as she leaves a holotape reacting to when you launch a nuke.
---
Doesn't she get killed by mole miners?
---
I agree.
---
Isn't there an enclave console which suggests this?
---
Honestly it's really easy.
---
I dont consider nukacrypt cheating.
---
Planning on buying the mod for Optimized Bracers for that in a little bit. 
---
Anti social introverts have the chance to be Mr Rogers when it’s online gaming. Good therapy for p2p real world situations as well. That and working retail where you have to talk to strangers about dumb things. It really helped me. 
---
aaaaaaaaaaaaaand you're banned.
---
I might need to log in tonight 😅 
---
When will you be on ? I’m looking for a few things and some things for a friend 💖 thanks !!! 
---
If I remember correctly Riflegaming promotes RMT.
---
That sucks. I'm hoping with the dedicated pvp mode those that want to mess with other players will go there and leave the pve mode to those of us who want to co-exist in somewhat peace. 
---
Kind of like Vault City in FO2.
---
Really, someone is gonna start this again?  You very clearly don't understand what you are talking about.
---
Is your load out different? Wearing loud armor or power armor?
---
Also, robots and then super mutants seem to have high perception. Especially Gutsy and robobrain, so it’s hard to sneak around them.
---
Where are u going with grenades golf club?
---
Lmao. My friend and I had Poseidon power plant, and we had all of the extractors we needed. But some random walks up and begins taking it WHILE WE'RE AT THE WORKSHOP! we kill him. A couple of times actually. And then my buddy sees he's in game chat. We go listen to him. He says he only wanted the workshop for the power cores extractor. My buddy says he could've just walked up and taken them, I have plenty of cores, and he never really uses power armor. 
---
Ps4, just loaded into a world dead and now im stuck in a loading screen. Turning game off
---
I made a post like this a couple months back and the feedback was mixed, much like this post.
---
It can be frustrating, but at the end of the day, people do play how they want to play and there is no changing that. There are a couple of tactics to combat it:
---
Ethical:
---
- Someone already said this, but ensure you have a Tesla Rifle equipped
---
- Add Tesla Bracers to your PA torso and just jump into the middle of the action— this is essential the same effect as a tesla rifle
---
- Throw grenades into the mob, ensuring you have grenadier equipped for increased blast radius
---
All of the above methods will allow you to at least deal some damage so you will reap the XP/loot rewards.
---
Questionable:
---
- Purposely position yourself between the enemy and the player to either prevent their damage from occuring, or causing them to die due to the blast area of their TSE
---
- Continually troll the player by literally going everywhere they go— lean into meat piles so they are unable to loot the bodies, rather they will contually see the Invite to Team/Trade prompts... this is extremely annoying
---
- Equip an Instigating or Two Shot Fat Man and rain hell down upon the mobs killing most before the TSE cowboys have a chance to react
---
- At Whitesprings Club House, actively keep closing the doors to prevent the players from entering, or mobs from leaving. This also works with the back door and the turret bases
---
You have to figure out strategies to make theie playstyle either work for you, or to at the very least give them a taste of your frustration, however petty it may be 😁
---
Happy Cake Day! If you’re on PS4, u/lordbaronstein is the guy you want. 
---
Ha, thanks!
---
Sweet I will check that out, thanks!
---
I’m on most of the day today
---
Yeah. Honestly. I'm tired of assholes messing with my lower level friends. When I was level 50 like him, everyone was around that level. Now, it's an uncommon level to see. 
---
Skipping story / game experiences isn't my bag. I'll def use it for subsequent times though 
---
This plus perks like martial artist for more swing speed and gun fu so you can quickly clear groups of mobs. Sneak build is also great. You can usually get in a handful of sneak hits before you are detected.
---
If ur server hoping in whitesprings kill one sentry bot as they are worth 550 xp. 
---
I have a lot of those.  I am not on for the weekend though. I sell full charged for 100 caps and 50 to 100 %  charged for 50 caps 
---
Gonna try her again shortly... Although I don't know why I bother, same shit is gonna happen. Will report back :)
---
Nah, loadout is the same, I double checked my activated cards and even swapped my Deep Pocketed legs for Muffled, still the same result.
---
However, your second point might be it... I've faced a lot of Super Mutants (Wes Tek) and Robots (Watoga) lately sooo that'd make perfect sense.
---
Thanks gator.
---
Also if you find a junk node in the world you can build your camp on it and get free screws, springs, and other junk for free forever with no farming
---
Thanks!
---
Ign koenig26
---
ok, submit a ticket cos you are literally the first person I have heard has this issue
---
Deeper testing determined this was only happening with Electrically Charged if the target did not have Pacifist on. If you have experience otherwise, please give me details so I can test as well.
---
There is another one called the "old ring". Isn't too far from there if I remember right. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj5ttm/old_ring_location/
---
Respawns happen because of new players joining, or, if you have a friend there, leaving and rejoining the server. You can also run 2 instances of the game with a second account.
---
SNEAK IS A BROKEN MECHANIC THAT BETHESDA HASNT BEEN ABLE TO FIX SINCE FALLOUT 4, please refer to all of my previous comments about it. 
---
I havent seen one so far, i dont know if theres one to be found in Fallout 76
---
Yes. There are many posts about it. It was nerfed in patch 5.
---
I have one and I’m just asking tbh
---
Lvl 128 here. I like to farm lower level events for Legendaries (lvl 5-10 stuff) and leave it on the body outside of Vault 76. Hopefully a nice surprise for our newly emerging vault dweller friends lol. They can't use them right away but won't take long to rank up. I sometimes also build lvl 1 Brotherhood of Steel rifles and leave them there. They come already furnished with a stabilized stock, hardened receiver and short scope. They can use those right away.
---
Definitely. Couple of my first legendary armour pieces came from the overseers camp. They were WAY too high for my character, so kept them until I came across a generous higher lvl player. 
---
I just got it today.
---
I'm not normally one for taking people's dropped junk. But, someone nuked whitespring, and I made my way there. As I'm there, I see three bags, and no players. I wait for someone, no one comes, so I pick all of this junk up. It's over 500 pounds worth of junk. I scrapped it and it's still about 450 worth of junk. I ended up making most of my caps back. 
---
While I would agree with that, lately it seems to be off of its "normal" behavior.
---
I am on PC, and I'd gladly accept Unstable Isotope and Plague Walker serums to test out those sources as well. These reactive damage tests are less testing slap damage and more seeing if reactive damage will force you into PVP unwittingly, but I'll record and report the results either way.
---
I won't be on any more today though. I may be on for a limited time tomorrow, unsure yet.
---
I’ve never seen it, but anywhere with mutants will yield a bunch of sledge hammers.
---
It's a nice outfit. I got it because I wanted to make a reference to fallout 4. 
---
I don't turret farm anymore cause it got boring and people didn't like it anymore.
---
Just go to any power armor spawn. Take out the fusion core. 
---
I guess its rare then, i am lvl 148 and been playing since beta and never found one. So you might be in the posession of a treasure 
---
A few weeks back, like 44 weeks ago
---
Im in the netherlands
---
Cool cause I don’t have a use for it because I have a female character 
---
Do a search and check the comments. Plenty of guides have said the same or had push back from others countering those that claimed it worked
---
I’m getting on in a few I’ll look you up ❤️ theRealTurdFergusonn ? My GT Rainbowsushi09. 
---
Thanks !!! 
---
I'll give you the [same answer as the guy who posted 1 hour ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/awkbdd/looking_to_join_a_group/)
---
Usually online afternoons PST in an hour or two from now.
---
Additionally... players are scared. They got griefed once and now they refuse even team invites from random players. Which is good! It's an apocalypse if you're not scared / paranoid it's just not exciting.
---
Also you're on PSN so what is an IG?
---
I think I can craft a sledge but I’m not sure where I I got the plan. But to find or buy I’ve never seen it
---
On Xbox just TurdFergusonn 
---
Dont rush the game and stay on the west part of the map. Also think about what build u want. 
---
All 3 rifleman cards maxed, tank killer, bloody mess, maybe tormentor. 
---
I love the T51b for it's rusty grungy aesthetic, to me it fits better into the wasteland than all those running around in shiny plastic bling covered PA.
---
The power armor tests were incidental to me using Reactive plates, but there's no difference in slap damage in PA other than what the damage reduction vs weapon damage causes (attacking someone in PA with your bare fists does.. \~1 slap damage. Slap damage is a maximum, not a minimum). Being in power armor did not increase how much slap damage I was doing.
---
I'll put Tesla arcs, mines, and sustained fire down for future exploration.
---
I’ll be on in a little while, I got a few I can spare. They aren’t going to be full but around 50-80ish %
---
I've seen it happen (pulling pacifist players into hostility) after proccing unstable isotope with an auto melee weapon. I've also seen poison damage behave weirdly when a wanted player attacks someone that has plague walker. I'm not sure on the mechanics, but it was happening even after they joined the same team. 
---
Thanks man. Is there a GT I can use to add you?
---
Yes there was, countering rudeness with rudeness is OK by me.
---
JustinJr2488
---
Had to do it 5 times last night. rough. 
---
Yes i know, but i've seen her rarely land sometimes even when gunners are concentrating all firepower.
---
Im Melee spec so i launch orbitals ands mash her when she lands, maybe i've just had bad gunners idk.
---
I fixed it for you...
---
I got it first look in the basement of a bar. Rusty nail or whatever it is. 
---
Go to Emmett Mountain Disposal Site just west of White Springs. There is always a PA in there as well as a generator w/ a core. Good chance you’ll grab two cores. I’ve got so many I usually don’t grab them unless they are over 50%. I literally find them everywhere and have never actually went and looked for them. I would love to dump some if you find me GT: BLUBLZRedeux
---
An easy fix for this is to put a 1000 cap bounty on the queen. More players join in.
---
I had a wedding beta right but it’s gone now. 
---
I completely agree! And also pvp and destroying bases is really fun too! Usually that’s only higher levels though
---
Or make them unlockable like location frames. Get the nuclear glare emote from actually launching your first nuke.
---
Theres also a Vault Dweller corpse in a fridge in Berkeley Springs where the workshop is. 
---
The workshop system didn't need changing.  I can promise you that this change is going to lead to nerfs in melee/ stealth builds, and also sentinel armor.
---
And the people who asked for this workshop change will be on here whining about the nerf.   It's just like the TSE weapons. The people making the nerfs necessary are the ones who will be bitching about it. 
---
I've wanted that since fallout one. Never understood why you could not.
---
Was this since the last patch? It's entirely likely that they've been patching up PvP mechanics with each patch (and it's not making it into the patch notes...).
---
Otherwise it may just be that the game is behaving inconsistently and/or there's other factors triggering it. Without more specifics, I don't know what to test for... and if the game's just being inconsistent, well, fuck, nothing I can do about that.
---
I dont have a Fallout76Custom.ini file...not in /data or documents
---
Really depends what you want out of your armor. Combat and marine are good if you’re looking for damage resistance.
---
Leather for energy resistance (DR is too low imo and having high ER is bit too situational for me)
---
Personally I wear trapper gear because I like the look of it. It’s not the best but it works for me. All limbs are buttressed and deep pocketed because I carry a ton of missiles, ammo, and heavy guns. And my chest piece has a dense mod because I’m an explosives/grenadier build.
---
If you’re going stealth sniper, don’t sleep on shrouded wood armor or ultra light modded armor pieces in general.
---
Really depends what you’re going for. 
---
Plague walker was before patch. Unstable isotope was both before and after. I have not been able to re-create the plague walker bug
---
He was rude to you by writing TL;DR? 
---
[Wow.](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/youre-too-easily-offended.jpg)
---
Well when i am at whitesprings shooting ghouls and someone comes and starts going melee on them i wont stop shooting.  So  yeah maybe its selfish but they can activity pacifist mode though. 
---
Merica!
---
Check your Nvidia settings maybe you have it capped there or in the actual game as well
---
I’ll be on later tonight around 8 EST. I’ve got a bunch and remember the struggle I’ll gladly kick you 5 no charge. My GT is EvilBrad3884
---
Martial Artist doesnt work anymore for gatling guns :(
---
This is adorable 😁
---
How can anyone help you when you can't even be bothered to post the system you're on. 
---
I just sicked up a little in my mouth, thanks for that.
---
Was he a lower level?
---
I actually had an argument with my fiancé about taking resources from workshops. He was under the impression you automatically become wanted. So he thought you might as well take the workshop. I told him that it's only if the resource is locked, and even then you just get a bounty - it doesn't start a contesting of the workshop.
---
I only lock mine when I'm extremely low, but immediately unlock it.
---
Cute story involving Poseidon: For some reason I had a bounty (probably shot a CAMP or something) it was low, and I just wanted it gone. There was a team of 3 or 4 guys that had claimed the workshop at Poseidon. So, I stood there. For ten minutes, asking one of them to shoot me (Unbenkownst to me, if you're in a Xbox party nobody else can hear you)
---
Finally, one of them killed me. I sent a message saying "it took you long enough" 
---
And thus the beginning of a pretty amazing relationship began.
---
&gt;This was before the patch that lets you contest it from anywhere though or whatever they changed; I assume it's even worse now but I haven't looked at it yet.  With PvP literally being a 1hit killfest back and forth it's not really entertaining and I rather not participate in the form that it's in currently.
---
Oh yeah it's much worse now after the workshop change. I'm fairly certain that the workshop change will lead to more nerfs, and the people who asked for the workshop change will be whining about those nerfs when it happens. 
---
It's exactly like TSE.   The people who create  the need for the nerf are the ones who whine about it.
---
Don't buy Atom yet. I want to see more fixes first and I want to be sure they deliver on their promises in the roadmap. I won't be buying Atom until those things are satisfied.
---
I believe it's great in PVP against assassin/sentinel types who just use combat armor, though. No rad resist ;)
---
Doors, were wide open entering.  Why bother shutting two doors as you leave, esp. knowing I'm in there.  Had to be a trap.
---
How would these traps even work except on noobs, unless you get someone overloaded and can't FT?  Even then you could just swap servers.
---
Since i got Power user perk i have had too many cores
---
He was lower than me, higher than my friend. He thought he could just take it because he only saw my friend. He didn't see me. 
---
Wow, again?
---
You can add me, GT EvilBrad3884. I’m only level 46 but I’m looking for people to play with and will gladly help you with whatever I can. 
---
Sent you a friend request
---
IDK. Trolling is like conspiracy theories.... It's no longer a conspiracy theory when it's true ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Awesome story mate.
---
And another example of why FO76 may not be the perfect game and does indeed have its flaws, but it's fun as fuck to play. 
---
Oh I'm right there with you, but for different reasons. I understand it's a corporation that needs to make money, and the market is leaning towards online these days. That's fine, that makes sense.
---
But the staggering incompetency? They don't fucking deserve full retail. If you're lying to me, at least be good at it and don't assume I'm an idiot that will give you several second chances. It's not trust that's broken, it's the assumption that they know what they're fucking doing.
---
Probably every Saturday. 
---
If you like how Fallout 4 plays, especially if you like survival mode you'll enjoy 76.
---
Oh sorry ps4
---
Oh, so ignorance can't be used as an excuse then. Lmao
---
Agreed
---
What would you recommend?
---
If walls could clip into the scenery, that would be really cool in allowing cabins right up against rock walls.  Every time I’ve tried a build next to a cliff wall I’ve had to have an “alleyway” between the rock and the house, I’d like to just use the rock as the 4th wall of my house.  
---
IMO One reason they restrict it more then it seems they need is turrets range. To avoid camp vs camp conflict. Which might actually be cool under the right circumstances.
---
I use the Quad Western Revolver. That thing is awesome, but I don't remember where I got it from.
---
Will do. My gt is dubjthreat. See you out there 
---
Yeah. I feel like some people just don't have great common sense. 
---
*Oh, I want some power cores from here. Let me just contest while these people are here*
---
Oh god I hated this grind-
---
Luckily has some friends pool resources to make handmade mods all on one character.
---
So annoying
---
I've been in line behind you for like 20 minutes. Feel like I'm back at the DMV quest.
---
I can’t thank people like you enough, I’m still a low level and when ever someone helps me out it makes my day, just saying thanks
---
(To those wondering I’m a level 21)
---
Thanks man! 
---
I like the reply!
---
The Awareness perk will show you exactly how much armor you're ignoring when you use incisor, Anti Armor weapons, armor piercing clips, etc. You can see the exact same dip in armor when equipping an Anti Armor laser weapon, and you can also see how the Energy resistance doesn't budge. 
---
I've dropped 3k of a few types of ammo in White Springs and Watoga Train Station before. It's easy to collect that much when you only ever use .45 &amp; .308 but you pick up all ammo because it basically weighs nothing with Bandoleer lvl 2.
---
I do enjoy playing it and a bit excited for the upcoming add ons, but you have to remember it is very different from the past games. If your main joy of Fallout is the companions and clear story than you may not like this game. Lot of the story can only be learned through hill tapes so if you don’t mind listening to them fully from time to time you won’t get the story. Also many of the quest are a bit repetitive but they are trying to add more quests to increase variety. 
---
I bought it as preorder at $80 and I do feel bad from how the game came out, but if I could buy it at a cheaper cost now I wouldn’t have mind as much. 
---
In the long run, you will have good moments playing this game and then not so good moments. Everyone’s experience will be different so just keep an open mind if you do decide to play it. 
---
I have been bouncing back and forth between those two games. Since it had a price drop and with the road map of content to come I think it’s well worth it and it will continue to improve. It is fun they just need to hammer some shit out that should have been fixed by now. If you can be a touch forgiving of that give it a go. 
---
Right. I wish mic/chat was used by more players. Because if it was locked all it takes is a "hey, can I get some cores?" 
---
I'll set them up for low levels and lock them because they need them.. But when higher levels stop by I literally drop 4-5 at their feet, tell them to take them and go.
---
Is there one for PC??? 
---
Oh, that's pretty cool. Glad you got yours, thought it was going to be green.
---
Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell 
---
Bullshit.   There's a lot of "hard core PVPers" who don't want to play in a server where everyone is exactly like them.  And you are one of them. 
---
This changes everything. I think I'm nearly set for the submachine gun, just got to grind out those radium rifles now I guess. Thanks for this! 
---
Wow, I am there, I'm -

Automatically stores everything 
---
I've had 2 disappear, I didn't think of that tho. I wonder if it gave me any advantage, or if it's just another broken thing. 😜
---
if you move you CAMP station after having placed it, it will only change where you spawn at.  so if you are spawning in a shitty place, move the CAMP.
---
otherwise, once placed, you can not change the "area" of your CAMP with out paying to move again.  there are some perks and mags that can help with the cost.
---
There's also a bug where your team mates can't fast travel either. The only fix is to re-log. Usually I just take off my armor and frag myself so I can fast travel via respawn.
---
People also farm enemies for legendaries, XP, hardened/glowing mass, etc.
---
Yeah. I've tried talking to SO MANY PEOPLE only for them to ignore me. We weren't using the cores anyways. It wasn't even locked. 
---
One of my favourite things to do in fo4 was to walk to random areas and just read the terminals/note and listen to holotapes, so that won't bother me so much and thanks for the response, buying now 
---
There's another right at the top of a mountain next to the top of the world. It's the tallest point on the map and is next to a jangles doll. Has an inscription on it and is worth 100 caps I think. 
---
I thought it converted ore to utracite, but I did a nuke in the toxic valley for violet flux, and I noticed that the utracite ore spawned next to the normal ore site, not instead of. 
---
I wanted to do lucky strike mine, not because of the dude in there, but for the ore conversion, has anyone done that yet? 
---
Yes. And they can move them and if they move their camp they still have them. A friend and I tested it out really early on in the game. 
---
I get most of my laughs from fo4 from the glitches and stuff so should hopefully be pretty fun then haha
---
Laser rifles are good just expect to repair the often. 
---
It'll probably go up again. When all said and done it should be just enough, lik
---
I started playing a week ago for the first time, having a lot of fun rn
---
6514 left
---
Saw a long time ago but it it’s lowest level compared to the I have wasn’t worth the price 
---
I like that it's difficult, it's the current endgame after all. Sadly the loot doesn't equal the difficulty level. 
---
 Wat ago vendors.  Craft and scrap a few pieces,
---
Next, go to asylum and do line in the sand.
---
Next, go do a glasses caverns run.
---
Next, go to that cia spy site west of harpers and clear it for the clipboards (mats for next round) and look around for technical data sheet as one will almost always be there.
---
Next go to fort , turn on technical data.
---
Repeat, but within the same day skip glassed caverns.  Enough people farm cia site that you may still be able to do it repeatedly too, but if not, it’s a once a day also.
---
Eventually, you’ll get what you need, but this isn’t a quick thing.
---
Does PSN have a similar party feature? Because I've noticed most people play in parties and it prevents communication with anyone outside the party
---
I've found several vault dweller bodies laying around about 4 or so in my travels. Wish I could remember where they were. 
---
Wow I only have that happen in third person view when targets are close. 
---
I melee all of the time, and in white springs i wade into the center of the mob and wail ( I am a Vampire build), i honestly never really care about the slaps then, since I am healing full time (I am on pacifist). I suspect most melee characters understand thst price to play. 
---
I just try to tag as many as I can without killing, so other can get thier taste. It is actually a pretty fun challenge.
---
Now the Queen, I stand in front of her to keep her on the ground, as well. Every once in a while i get area effect slapped into oblivion, but c'est la vie.
---
I think turrets must be bugged for some people. I have 5 and they kill mole rats, super mutants, and ghouls. Pretty sure my base would be destroyed without them. 1000 weight limit for stash would be nice, and the camp limit is way too low.....
---
Having played a game for years that didn't have these restrictions, I can tell you that it's a big game changer and way more fun!
---
Alright! Good to know!
---
He could be on a team with the teammate calling out map locations. There's lots of "tricks" with the PVP system as-is.
---
Same here. I'm a melee build and I was hoping to craft/scrap a bunch of these to find the few sledgehammer mods I haven't learned.
---
Yeah, PSN has a PlayStation chat party. It's the same I think. 
---
All my dreams crushed the second I saw Xbox only
---
The Radroach with the hat and cane and Wedding Ring is an Easter Egg that's a reference to "Roachy" from the "Final Pam" Monster Factory videos Polygon made on YouTube. 
---
You can add me TheMeiserVader. I am working on a an alt right now and would be happy to tag along. 
---
Could be possible. Im sitting on the acid deposit in the middle of the small lake, southeast of the top of the world. Its a cool spot and Ive seen two different camps there in my time playing 76.
---
Final Pam disagrees.
---
&gt;Honestly though I don't see what is big deal, if they're making a mode that caters to the PVP portion, why not make the other one PVE? 
---
Because griefers hate the idea of playing in a server where every single person is exactly like them. 
---
I got plasma but no fusion
---
Put that on plz how much?
---
I got a pic of my character just being a floating head 😂 every time I’d log in on 76 for a few days I’d be a head walking around for a while but they fixed it. Some glitches are funny some piss ya off like not being able to loot mobs sometimes. But as they keep going they are fixing stuff. It seems that they needed much more time then they had and should have just extended when they released. But they chose to stay on the date they announced and it was a mess. Poor developers probably struggling to keep up for a while. Seems they got fucked over but it does have a lot of potential. 
---
On one hand, I get pretty inappropriate and anyone in the area should probably not hear the vulgar things that come out of my mouth. 
---
But it makes it hard when you can't talk to other players in passing.
---
Currently I'd say metal armor is best. Most enemies doesn't do energy damage, so you can ignore it and just rely on grounded to buff the difference. There's some value in getting a few rad resist pieces (marine chest, any trapper/robot piece), but the trade offs can be a little disappointing. Plus if you farm rad shield often enough, you could just take it as the situation arises.
---
Oh you'll definitely like this game then
---
i saw some where here, do a search, about "video settings"  there is a setting that is capping you at 50, it should be 60 actually, but yeah, you got to turn off what ever that setting is.
---
i was capped at 60, now i can 100's at med, or play ultra at around 45 - 60
---
Pretty sure. Looks like "X" for "Movement-Automatic"
---
I had a very similar experience this week.  It feels great to help people out!  I guess I am a responder after all.
---
I’d recommend taking things slow and try to figure out how the new mechanics work. Also don’t rush the main quests since the level of enemies will quickly out level you. (Events will be your best options for farming and level grinding) Making friends make things easier but it all can be done solo. Melee weapons tend to be the best choice for pure damage but the strongest weapons are explosive two shot weapon, I’m sure you heard of there controversy. 
---
Lastly save up your caps because the game is stingy with handing them out. Once you find a reliable way to gain caps then you should buy weapons and mods. Also start with a small camp and build off of that once you get more supplies and furniture. Not much else to say but goo luck!
---
I just watched them. One is a 2-hour long incoherent rambling video, and the other is a video bashing Oxhorn for merely liking Fallout 76. This dude is just trying to smear dirt.
---
Reading through this is a pile of garbage. All you people supporting Bethesda should be embarrassed. This company used to be promised on making great games with great lore and much replay ability factors. 
---
I bought a Collectors Edition, don’t even play the game anymore due to the small fact it’s nothing they even promised, and everyone is still beta testing this game essentially for them. 
---
Their decision they make is sub par to everything. They can’t even handle PvP on the servers they have now let a lone a survival mode or what it be in the DLC. The rest of the DLC is a joke a new crafting bench can be hit fixed in. Switching the crafting system is something that should’ve been done in the 4 years they developed the game in house like Todd Howard said they were doing. The game came out with the same bugs Fallout 4 had, they rushed the product to boost their year end sales and make their investors happy. 
---
They shouldn’t be coming out with DLC when you can’t even do the main function that they always taught you in Fallout save everything. The stash space is limited and if you just carry it all you can get banned for duping. Their customer service is sub par I still haven’t gotten my replacement bag. I wouldn’t even want to deal with trying to get my account switched back over from their shitty  system that is just banning people. 
---
They need to be working on fixing and stabilizing the game, but in reality they can’t because they don’t want to open up mods because heh will lose control of how the game is played, with 3rd party people doing it better than they have been. Mods will be the end of Bethesda having control of this game so don’t count on that anytime soon to mane the game better either. 
---
Some of you people need to open your eyes because if they don’t knock the next game outta the park. We are not gonna have any type of Bethesda games because they won’t get investors because they will not have a community following like they should.
---
I say all this hoping they do because I love the games and say all this stuff with harsh criticism because I don’t want to see them fail and they need to know they have a pissed off community that will not support their games because of the mere fact that every time they could use bait and switch they have, and the fact that they have lied to us about a ton of things like state of development and what type of bag I’ll receive, or that they are working on fixing a game that has a ton of bugs but wanna add shitty DLC with 65% of it should’ve been in the game to start 
---
Yeah. 
---
Yeah the aiming ring mod is useless. But for me its more of trying to find out how to aim with it. And i manage pretty well. It is a civil war weapon after all.. 
---
That could be an interesting concept; the more junk, weapons, Chen's, etc. That you provide a faction the better that faction becomes. 
---
I think it would work significantly better if there were NPCs ( you give the Responders weapons, they become more effective in battles). Though for the Raiders it would be pretty neat to see more robots designed like Rose taking up residency in raider locations and those locations being beefed up with more defenses with the more junk you provide.
---
It would be a great way to have a better faction affiliation and make you feel more a part of the faction instead of a "yeah the brotherhood is all dead but I am the only remaining Paladin" feel about this wasteland.
---
wait, why gun-fu on a melee weapon? You just run up to them and swing at them...
---
About 2 days into one of my characters on fo4 and just killed Kellogg just so the brotherhood could come by 😂 so that shouldn't be too bad and got about 1 million caps on her, I'm always so stingy with money in games
---
I don’t have the caps right now but I’ll let you know when I do
---
Lucky jerks. 
---
Oh yeah! Nice
---
It does great base damage, but it's legendary effect is minimally useful when you're running 75% armor piercing from effects. It's a fine weapon until you find a better legendary though. I'd honestly go for an Instigating one if you're going for fast 1hit kills- if you get your listed damage high enough, you are 1hit killing things, but able to attack faster than a 2h can, so you're going to be doing "better" than them :)
---
&gt; **Workshops** \- there's a solution for this. Make a different game mode/mechanism for workshop challenges in adventure mode. Challenge for a workshop takes caps from the challenger to initiate a challenge for ownership. A warning is sent to the owner that their workshop ownership is being challenged and there's a time limit to respond. Then send out several waves of enemies to attack the workshop - player that gains the most kills wins the ownership challenge and gains/retains ownership of said workshop.
---
 I don't think workshops even should be contested in adventure mode.    When people try to claim the work bench, they should get a notice saying "you aren't allied with this settlement."  Just like in Fallout 4. 
---
Let's be real here. If there's a workshop that you absolutely need, there is a server out there where it's free for the taking. 
---
Yes it’s extraordinarily broken right now. The cost of ammo and chems to Ultracite vents and two star junk is not worth it. Couple that with the immortality bug and flying off to the north, and no one shows up at fissure prime nukes. 
---
Too bad not everyone is like you in 76.

I just got booted from a server and was in the middle of the daily quest at cranberry bog. Killed the scorch beast collected DNA the booted come back in and quest is gone
---
VATS doesn't really instakill players. Criticals do. It works on players
---
Oh my God noooooo D:
---
I'll be on 10.30 uk time
---
Lmao, i know the feeling, i miss my good old baby Rattle 
---
One other possibility is if you've used "creative" building techniques (there's a couple glitches to place things in ways that aren't normally allowed), it seems to not want to place. I've got a mule character with a very creative base, that I usually have to relog 5-8 times if I want to get it to actually place. There's absolutely no bases near me, I can even re-place my CAMP in the same spot if I want to. My main character also started having major issues getting his base to place after I glitched a second foundation piece off the side of the cliff to place an artillery piece on. I'm going to remove it soon and see if that resolves it.
---
You are welcome! Happy scrapping!
---
It runs fine on other games, and I have searched fallout settings and can't seem to find anywhere where you could cap the frames. Thanks
---
Thanks 
---
I think maybe that's what the camera update might be about
---
Joseph is a... Well. He's lost his way, and this video shows just how much of a bully he's become.

In the abandoned bog town, the tallest building, if you go onto the roof you can drop down the elevator shaft into a room that is like screw shangra-la multiple of every item that gives screws, even just loose screws in desks, everything, it’s amazing. 
---
Across the street is the police station with a few handcuffs for screws as well.  
---
You can also buy them in bulk from some vendors sometimes.

---
If i remember correctly, the camp budget is based on the number of triangles (with a little adjusting based on usefulness of the item, ie turrets) in the model of the object.
---
This is to attempt to ensure a consistent framerate for consoles and PC.
---
if they increased the budget, it couldn't be by much, or it couldnt be by as much on console.
---
The game needs a karma system, it would make stuff like this relevant and interesting, and create another side to the game.
---
I believe if you scroll down a bit you will see multiple other similar accounts. There is obviously something wrong at AWS or there is something in the code that broke (similar to the New Years disaster?)
---
Quests are average or good, assuming you aren't bothered that you don't mind interacting with robots, reading notes or listening to tapes. I read a lot of books and audiobooks so I'm fine with that.
---
Exploration is just as good as in any other Fallout game.
---
Base building is shite. Limit on how much you can build is much smaller than F4.
---
Weapon/armour crafting comparable to F4, maybe better.
---
Bugs aren't that many right now.
---
Servers are noticeably better and I think I haven't had DC since they removed dupes (about 10-20h game time). Lag is gone to.
---
Players so far either ignored me, worked together for a short bit, showed some emotes. Mostly forgettable feature except for GOD DAMN MOBS RESPAWNING WITH 60lvl+ GHOULS/SUPERMUTANTS IN YOUR FACE IF SOME HIGH LVL PLAYER IS WITHIN 50KM (not really that big) RADIUS FORCING YOU TO LEAVE SERVER OR DIE. On occasion.
---
I'm playing solo and I would say worth it, but on heavy discount (like previous Fallout games I bought).
---
In fallout 76 you kinda make your own story. 
---
Yeah. And I can freely choose any cards to share.
---
It's already irrelevant.
---
If you want 3* legendaries, you farm West-Tek and other known good areas.
---
If you want recipes and receivers, you sell the drops from above and buy what you want on trading subreddits or trading discords.
---
SBQ is a novelty only for people who haven't killed her before. She's a bullet sponge, who can become impossible, summons waves of crap who cost you more bullets, and drops nothing superior to a random 3* mutey.
---
She was irrelevant long ago.
---
Seriously, what is the 76 fan base? You got people like the Appalachian PD protecting people, you got other people just killing and looting everything, AND THEN THERES THIS *SHIT*
---
I’ve provided proof it doesn’t work. Nobody has provided proof is does.
---
Shoot them in the head.  I cant decide if you are joking or not. Super Mutants are a non issue for rifle builds.
---
Even if you torso shoot them, from sneak it is 2-3 shots and they are dead.
---
Seriously... 
---
Okay cool can you make me a Nukes and dragons perk card list that would work with power armor like perks that are crucial for power armor and repairs and weapon repairs??
---
I think the asylum, if there are super mutants. Its between the forest and the toxic valley
---
[suggestion] search the forum to see if your [suggestion] has already been suggested
---
Just got it for a tenner so I'm preparing for the worst, hoping for the best and if it ends up a bit sucky then it's not much money 
---
Nuke zones. Get one shot in and let the higher levels kill them. Full xp
---
I'm level 49 and run from every schorchbeast, am saving the final quest.  Killing one takes hours of farming lead and stims, for virtually no gain.  It's also generally a boring fight.  Nukes are for Whitesprings when I want to level.  
---
Get bent nerd.  Jesus.  
---
Proof that it doesn't work ***for you***. 
---
You can't prove that it's broken ***for everyone***.
---
Sounds like you don't want to play in a server where every single person is exactly like you. Which is exactly why you should be forced to. 
---
You need to check your refresh rate and Vsync settings 
---
Ok, provide proof it works for you
---
Are you on Xbox? I’d like to know more tips / build suggestions please!
---
🤓
---
Thanks guys
---
Fo76 is great if you can overlook some of the bugs, I've found its also a lot more fun when you have people to play with :)
---
Use melle or anything armor piercing and they go down easy.
---
Yeah, I played my first character during the BETA, and it was fine because other players were similar levels. At level 20-25 you'd stroll over to Whitesprings to pick up the sword, and you could actually kill the ghouls. Try that now and you'll need a lot of respawns.
---
I'm not sure player-level servers can work, because people play with their friends. It needs a rethink though.
---
On the roadmap it just says "being sure to capture all your favorite memories using the new functional camera." so I figured they were updating how the camera works and making it less clunky to use and so you could set things like Default Filter, Default Distance/Range/FoV ect
---
Only time will tell I guess. 
---
I think the game is really great right now. But I've had the game since beta at around 700+ hours and love the game. The game breaking glitches aren't around like they use to be and there is a nice community. With dlc on the way imo it's a good investment. 
---
What really sucks is if you're sure you need to make a slight Camp placement adjustment before really starting to camp, the cap cost goes from 40 to like 190 or something
---
Well as a fallout fan, and been playing almost daily since beta, i rly enjoy it, eventhough i discovered all locations, got most building plans and did all the quests... I am still enjoying it
---
You're gonna get a yes from some people, and a no from others. 
---
I would say yes. 
---
There are still bugs and glitches... But there's also a lot that's been fixed since launch and the roadmap looks rather promising. 
---
What's going on? Dude has been trading for over 15 min??
---
Back before the TSE need I was doing Uranium Fever when someone showed up with a TSE shotgun. I hadn't planned on using it, but I had one too. I one-shotted all three legendaries. I still feel kinda bad, but I didn't feel like he gave me a choice; it was him or me. The loot was all crap. Karma, eh.
---
Trades keep crashing 
---
Where did you put it? 
---
If you are on the fence- I say get it from a redbox and try it for the weekend. That way if it 8snt for you you are only out a couple dollars. It's awesome though and with all the had press you can get used copies at a great price. Well worth the 30$. This game is MUCH more fun (for me at least) when played with someone than solo.
---
Uhh... apparently you do?
---
(insert overused Todd Howard "It just works" joke)
---
I love it! Well done!
---
I wonder what percentage of FO76 players are adults too.
---
Don’t bother using power Armor if all you have is a frame
---
Love it! My boyfriend got a shot of his character lounging with this same dude, wish I had the photo on my phone!
---
The tennis court my man, that is the best kill zone. As flat as the parking lot but enclosed and the colors make the piles easy to see.
---
Wow, unmarked spoiler much you douche. 
---
Running an utracite core should up the strength in power armor, at this point they have increased the strength attribute from 10 to 15, but they didn’t change how power armor adds strength up to 12 so unless you add the motion assist torso you don’t usually get a strength buff from PA. 
---
Running a utracite core should give you an additional +2 strength. 
---
Try attaching more foundations. Then a staircase to the original foundation. Then floor on too of staircase. Then somehow connect the second floor to one of the new foundations. 
---
Try deleting the original foundation then. Then delete everything else the normal way. Top to bottom
---
I have a bunch of problems with the game but 10 bucks is a great price. I paid 25 and im fine with the money spent
---
This list plus level 3 cap collector and grape mentants, that will almost double all of those prices. 
---
Funny thing is for the most part I am a trader and helped new people(when they don't just run) I just didn't shy away from PvP as pve offers no challenge or reward once your very well geared.
---
So while you may not like PvP that's fine you are never forced to PvP at any point you can log out if someone attacks you or your base I've had to do it before when I was being farmed in PVP. But to say "I don't like this because I have to change servers when I'm being hunted in a pvpve game" seems rather stupid even moreso when you realize how little slap dmg does and how easy it is to get hundreds and hundreds of stimpaks.
---
yeah if you have parasites, you gotta get rid of them. Supposedly there's a fountain that cures diseases near whitesprings golf course, never used it myself.
---
You know my comment was a fucking joke, right? 
---
I've killed so many super mutants. I've crafted over 150k 5.56 ammo alone from theur melted down weapons.
---
I too want this knowledge
---
I love the game but everything you said is true. Very annoying. 
---
The fuckers don't show in my PIP though. I mean, an STD test would show me as "fairly clean, have fun", but food dribbles through me as ice cream would through a heated copper pipe, apparently.
---
Wait wait wait, lemme get this straight. You spend real money on virtual chairs, rugs, lamps, and paint. But you draw the line at photoframes?? What's the difference!
---
I was testing this weapon out for some time and I have mixed feelings about it myself. Here is what I have found it useful in.
---
Where it shines(dimly): The Syringe Rifle has no lvl requirement.
---
The lack of a level requirement makes the use of Poison and Bleeding useful in the hands of a freshly new character that is going to focus in stealthy ranged attacks. 
---
The poison damage is strong enough to kill things up to lvl 22 and in some cases creatures that are lvl 42-62 (mainly ghouls) However, it takes a lot of shots.
---
The Endangeral reduces a target's damage resistance by 25% for 2 minutes. This mod is super useful for queen fights and if you are simply looking for a quick way to take down heavy armored targets without wasting 1 or 2 extra rounds of ammo.  Out of all the mods currently available (As you can see hints of some other mods that are not yet in the game) This one is by far the brightest of the mods. 
---
The Syringer is near silent if not totally silent when fired.
---
While it is possible to kill creatures much higher than your level with this rifle, it is held back by some notable issues. 
---
Issue 1: It sometimes does not apply the poison from sneak attack and must be put away and pulled back out.
---
Issue 2: Some creatures have poison resistances built in.
---
Issue 3: It's low rate of fire and damage isn't great.
---
Issue 4: It takes a long time to kill sometimes.
---
My thoughts: Use the Endangeral for the big bad fights, use the poison on freshly new characters because at lvl 2 you can kill everything up to lvl 20ish reliably from stealth provided that creature isn't super poison resistant.
---
uh by just saying what their experiences have been?
---
 There's more than enough misconception going around.  It doesn't need to be added to.
---
Yeah lol, it seems highly unlikely.  
---
It’s worth it but don’t expect greatness. I like it well enough to keep playing but for me it doesn’t hold a candle to the other games.
---
I don't care what you want man, i don't want my camp being targeted by fucking griefers because you're too lazy to move to a commonly frequented area. 
---
And good for you. Griefers are the biggest issue the game has, in my mind, and this idea only makes it even easier for those soulless sacks of shit to wreck my day. 
---
So you want to implement Jim Crow laws into video games huh? 
---
fucking why? you people keep asking for more stash space yet here I am, level 130 and haven't gone above 500 at any point. 
---
You guys are fucking terrible at inventory management.
---
I’m sad other players aren’t more welcoming tbh... 
---
Tried bulking? Selling to vendors?
---
Can you link me the forum URL? (So I can look over the forum before I post a suggestion next time) 
---
I didn't realise there was a FO76 Forum if I'm honest, I posted here as Reddit can gain a lot of traction in getting the attention of the Dev Team in Bethesda and it opens up the opportunity for players to chime in as well. 
---
Goddamn ass-worms.
---
No need to apologize. Platform would have nothing to do with an issue like this, some people are just jerks
---
As to the perk card issue, try moving to a new server and see if that helps
---
By forum I meant this sub. Search this sub with key words. 
---
Yeah I can mod the heck out on ps4, thanks for the heads up. We should find a PC guy
---
So 2-shot does a couple of things. It used to double your damage and then send out two slugs with half that value. (or in the case of shotguns, two bursts of pellets). 
---
Now, it adds 20% and divides by two, and sends out two bursts of pellets for that value. 
---
So, you have a much less ACCURATE firearm, that does slightly more damage to enemies that are right in front of you. 
---
So yeah, it's still worth using if you don't have anything better, but it drops the effective range for that max damage to damn near melee range. 
---
If you can't take humor from the current state of the game, there's not a lot left to enjoy. 
---
I don’t care about any of that. I’m addressing the fact that you think the 10mm SMG is a terrible gun, I’m addressing the fact that you think a 10mm pistol is going to do anything compared to a 10mm SMG. Yet you sit here and gush over a Nocturnal Combat Knife, which is a legitimately terrible weapon. “Oh yeah at night I do so much more”, good, so 50% of the time you’re useless, fantastic. A Balanced Build is great until you encounter any actually challenging content, and then you do everything worse than dedicated builds. To be that weak would cripple any build that actually want to focus on doing any real damage. 
---
Maybe it does not show up in vats like anti armor magazines/clips.
---
That’s literally amazing
---
Love it man, keep up the good work there. Cheers from PS4 haha :)
---
There is one there I have used it many times. It’s in the gazebo right behind the tennis courts. I always fast travel there to get rid of my diseases.
---
Agreed that'd bring it a lot of people, though they'd also need to adjust her scaling bc right now afaik it gets pretty crazy and the increase of players coming in to do it then still might make it not worth while w/ all the ammo you still have to put into it.
---
I love to think most people are like you.I'm like you. There's only a small minority acting like asswholes. Thank you for being you!
---
Depends on how you want to use it. As a long-range weapon? No. It still has the "clips on something right in front of you and kills you instantly" bug from fallout 4, because why fix bugs?
---
However. You can do a decent suicide-based build with one. The fatman, a mess of ammo, absolutely nothing else in your inventory and go to fucking town. 
---
Yeah. Thanks for that, some of us are nowhere near that point!
---
Oh cool, I'm on mobile and sadly with the Apollo app (which is a highly rated app) I don't seem to be able to search by Subreddit. 
---
Normally if I need to search Reddit I'll use google and type "site:Reddit" at the start but sadly I'm at work at the moment so didn't do a search before hand. 
---
Yes, this is suggested a lot. 
---
.... Guess I know who I'm shooting on sight. 
---
There is a guaranteed one at the Rusty Pick bar basement in the Ash Heap.
---
I’m on mobile too and using the official app , which has search. 
---
I doubt apollo would be highly rated and missing search? 
---
I laugh about it everyday.  "It just works."  But adding to the fear mongering and confusion for players who don't keep as up on things as you and I is not helpful to the community nor to the game becoming better.
---
 Thanks. That will do just fine. I have a 2 star level 20 1 shot Exploder with a big mag but its almost lost its usefulness for the close in emergent stuff. I am immune to explosions so that's not a problem. 
---
 I'll try the 2 shot and see what the next Deathclaw thinks. Its does not matter much, my Combat Knives carry the load these days. ;)
---
I did not even think about this. It would be intereating to see. 
---
That is a very interesting idea.
---
It is worth getting for 10 bucks. Lots of issues still but you may get lucky and not run into them as often as others have. 
---
For 10 bucks i say buy it for sure
---
Working on my own tank atm. The big problem with any of the tanky God teir assassin's armor is that a vats crit goes right through it. So if you want to force people to deal with your damage mitigation rather than just crit kill you you have to run stealth boys or something like it as it keeps you from being vats. Secret Agent is mandatory for dealing with players who know the ins and outs of PvP because of this.
---
I’m slowly buying white springs resort plans (the 900c ones) and would be willing to buy one you’re looking for in exchange for one you have and don’t want 
---
It never was a " nuclear steamalicious turd". this troll topic on the other hand....
---
Thank you all for the feedback. I had the same issue early in trying to move, I could not place it. Now that I have this one, dont want to change yet. Once I get the metal buildings, I may change up. 
---
Nope happened to me today too.  Something has gone wrong with there servers.  Sure things wont be fixed till monday either
---
Maybe they would, but I try to avoid other people, because most are already 50+ and I would like to kill something myself. Just walking around high lvl people and soaking XP is very boring and there isn't much else they can do, since gear they get most likely requires high lvl.
---
It seems as if multiplayer was either meant for friends or for people with 50+ lvl sitting at Whitesprings, because events are mostly boring "defend thingy".
---
FO76 is NSWF
---
I mean, the one shot explosive shotgun used to work pretty much the same way (the value of your weapons damage, as explosive damage) then they nerfed it down to 20-25% as well, so functionally speaking, it's pretty much the same, only with slightly better AOE damage. 
---
But if the 2 shot is a significantly higher level...
---
Wouldn't the best way to check this not be using awareness?  It's a temporary debuff perk, so it probably doesn't directly reduce existing numbers, but still debuffs the target by that amount.
---
Try seeing if you take the same, or fewer shots to kill an identical target when it's shot by a syringe with a weapon, and if each shot does more.  I figure that'd be the definitive way to test if the perk is working or not.
---
You're happy to find some Antibiotics or Disease Cure and bam: Ass-worms. Cure gone, water gone, drink water, ass-worms, repeat. 
---
Thanks! That's good info right there!
---
When I was low level I build like a " battle camp" with turrets and safe areas so if things got bad I would just drop it. Wold be fun to have pvp camp wars.
---
You can check karma this way and karma works.
---
I’ve never had these issues
---
It was £10 which is roughly $13
---
 Oh my. So I can melt nuke zone Ghouls so fast people complain and my knifes are terrible. I took very little damage partly because they die so fast.
---
 I hunt and kill multiple Scorchbeasts for fun on a daily basis ... so where is this challenging content you speak of.
---
You can check the karma syringer this way and it displays
---
Ive been curious to know what some of the technical issues could be with various CAMP limitations. (Like being able to run a foundation into dirt but not mountain(?)
---
You, sir, need a vampire weapon.
---
I've never ran a VATs build so I was unaware. . . That seems really unfun. . . Is there no anti-crit items in the game??? I was looking forward to PvP and now it sounds stupid as hell. 
---
Do your own homework, dude. 
---
That really allows for no variance.  
---
 Its a level 50 and I think we are around 160 damage. the level 20 is a 110 damage one.
---
HEY GUYS YONGYEA HERE WITH ANOTHER 25 MINUTE VIDEO WITH 6 AD BREAKS ABOUT BETHESDA'S LATEST TWITTER FEE-AH-SCO

Alright ill add you since Im sure its more fun with other people. Got a mic?

Do you feel like you wasted your time watching them?

Honestly just a bunch of fuckin' lootbox-buying cucks and shills here.
---
It has a search feature but I don't know how to search subreddits using it, and while I admit that's on me to find out like I said I'm at work and wanted to post the idea as I haven't see it posted before and I was likely to forget the idea while I deal with customers over the phone. 
---
Alright. Thanks. :) that's really nice of you. 
---
What a fucking loser
---
Sorry, I haven't seen it suggested before but I guess that's because I don't sort by new. 
---
So here's how you deal with this. Shoot fucking everything you see, that way when the higher level guy with the better gear comes through on his pass, you'll get something for pretty much free instead of having to throw hundreds of rounds into things. 
---
Take me roooaaaddsss
---
Wait...

For the time being two-shot weapons are only marginally better than their non legendary base models (and in fact anti-armor _may_ be a slightly better alternative). But I'm hoping in a future update they'll de-nerf two shot to maybe a +50% or +75% bonus making it a great go-to weapon. So unless you find another with additional modifiers I'd use it for now (it's certainly worth more than the ~20 caps you'd get by selling it) until you find a 2 or 3\* version or put it in the stash until it regains relevancy (if it does at all).
---
I agree. It would of been good to have living factions instead of dead ones. Experiencing the events and not just following the aftermath. 
---
Yeaaah. Some of us "aren't sacks of shit" so when we see griefers, we're not fans? 
---

&gt; Ass-worms. Cure gone, water gone, drink water, ass-worms, repeat.
---
I think this might have been the original FO76 tagline, tbh.
---
Yea, but that's kinda the point of media, traditional access media or otherwise.
---
Lmao, coming from the clown who still plays with Legos.
---
Well, there you go. 
---
Why do people not get that the story is not about the brotherhood, the responders, or anything like that?
---
It is about you and your survival. the closest thing to the usual rpg world saving glory is you sealing fissure prime and killing the scorched beast queen. you dont even stop the plague. At least I dont remember anything that stops it. just that you (alone) get vaccinated.
---
Why can't this place be on PC 
---
I wish higher level players would help me out, instead of griefing me. 
---
The idea is that the hand mechanism inside the suit is not designed for Finesse to do as needed to put springs in a gun or sew for armour. As you can see when getting in or out of it’s just bar with buttons to move the fingers. 
---
Just people that find babysitting someone else's kid on a rated M game a saving grace, I guess.
---
In my experience, whitesprings is over-rated, unless it's nuked, and as a non PA melee build you're kinda fucked there. 
---
Personally, I get most of my armor from watoga...you can run a loop around it, and every so often a legendary will spawn. 
---
So your surprised you guys can't successfully take up over half of a server all the time...?
---
Sleeping and make music makes sense.
---
Ok that's true. Thing about to make music. What do you need for it? Small fingers and finger precision. You what to screw weapons together with your PA big sausage fingers? Or make small ammunition with these big fingers? Think about it :) 
---
You're probably not finding something you want, but you might find something others want. When I got involved in r/market76 I was able to trade up to some good stuff.
---
I have one as well, found it during the beta and haven't seen one since.
---
I just pulled T51b Helm plans from Cranberry Bog Map #3, hope you find yours soon.
---
Im not sure but i think that came after last update.It have been like that maybe couple of weeks.It shows full damage if not equiped and as soon as equipped damage drops to basic.And if not in PA its all good.No problem with other guns.
---
 Stash? I have about 40 non junk pounds. I have no room to store anything after I stashed the exploder as i promised that to a friend, for when he gets to level 20.
---
  I have to bulk to get anything in it. ;)
---
Adds up... but still. Its tedious. Not in a “I need to survive, eat and drink” kind of way. More like I need to brush my teeth kind of way. 
---
Good job showing people the amazing side of video games! 
---
&gt; But who in the world is dropping real money on photoframes? 
---
It sounds like you would cause you want them enough to ask for them to be free. You just don't want to pay for them.
---
&gt; And some are really cool! I’d love to get some cool loading screens with them, but charging for them is just kinda overkill. 
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
&gt; Not begging, I don’t need them, but if you want more photos being taken, just make those free please? 
---
The opposite of what you're saying here cause if you weren't begging and you didn't need them, you wouldn't have posted about it.
---
&gt; Your community would appreciate it. 
---
No, YOU would appreciate it. Please don't lump the community into this when you're making a request mostly for yourself.
---
It's just as irresponsible as my declaring that no one in the community wants or uses photo frames because I don't use them at all and don't like them because most of them are gaudy and trashy.
---
So... Power armor crafty hands attachments? 
---
You're welcome! I'm always shocked at how quickly the negs appeared over there. I'll never understand those dudes.
---
Agreed, I was surprised, and it limits you so much because now your entire house has to be far enough away from the wall that nothing at all touches. 
---
Not even close. She'll be back
---
What are the two outright, blatant lies, though?
---
You can see distant weather systems, and the lod *does* have 16x times the detail, it's the first time they've used a new renderer since Skyrim. They also do use a new landscape propagation system. 
---
How terrible is the cannery that their canned meats spoil so quickly.
---
Its not a spoiler - its a fan-theory.  
---
You douche.
---
Start a new character.
---
No one said the music had to be good ;)
---
That could be an solution :) 
---
or an option that the PA hands get open while crafting and you use your regular hands. But I think that will look really creepy 
---
All vendors now have set plans so you can get exactly what you want pretty easy. 
---
Hahahaha that's true 😂
---
There's a list. 
---
One, it launched in what could, realistically, be called a late alpha/ early beta state, at full retail price. 
---
Two, just about every update has introduced more bugs, which usually sit around until the next patch, if it's fixed then. There's been at least one example of fixed bugs coming back, as well. 
---
Three, lack of quests, and other general "content". 
---
Four, every "balance change" is nothing but nerfs. 
---
Five, completely unacceptable disreputable, to outright illegal, actions by the company surrounding the game. The fraudulent canvas bag thing, the false advertisement with the rum, the leaking of personal data.
---
I mean, there's more, but that's more than enough. 
---
Awesome guys. I will be sure to add y'all. Thanks for the twitch TV info 
---
Fun yeahhhh!  *slams into a brick wall shirtless on a dirt bike while holding a beer and firing an assault rifle*
---
She, literally, leaves it for you to find when you leave the launch bunker.
---
Its set like she's been following you.  You go in, there's no message, you come out without launching there's no message, you launch and come out, instead of confronting you, she leaves a message berating you for you to find.
---
Where is this post nuke holotape?
---
I’d buy that!
---
The world works in mysterious ways. Do to others, as others do to you. 
---
Knowing that she sends a message after you launch a nuke finally is 100% a spoiler. Wtf are you talking about. A fan theory based off an end game event is itself a spoiler. How is that difficult to understand? 
---
Get a new shtick, you fucking nobody...
---
It's not that it's boring (though it can get a bit repetitive) but she's a waste of resources and lately has been nigh on impossible to kill.
---
After a few failed attempts, I've given up rushing to the event. I'll only go if I'm already in the area and not for the queen but for the in the nuke zone.
---
That's not a spoiler.  Christ.  Spoilers are things that spoil the story.  That doesn't spoil the story.
---
Spend a session doing a power plant workshop run. I too struggles with fusion cores, then I took over Thunder. Had a great night. Ended up with maybe 30. 
---
And if you don't want spoilers - get off the internet.
---
Infographics like LoL used to put out.
---
It spawns in golf clubhouse.
---
Just for lore reasons. If it was the gen 1 power armour frames it’s different. But we have what we have. 
---
No, she says she thinks it's it, but she leaves you a holotape that she could not possibly have left you had she died.
---
anti-armor instances in the game dont work with energy weapons. so its either bugged or an oversight. they dont need a damage buff. just bug fixes and durability fixes. 
---
I actually found them later the other day from someone who saw my post. Thanks a lot I’ll also keep that in mind 
---
This one really does seem to be an "eventually" job, friend.
---
I only need 15 more. Had a line on a few but a guy wanted 4K per plan. I said someone else can buy them at that price, I won’t. 
---
I can’t seem to log in for the last two weeks. 
---
https://twitter.com/pushkinforhouse/status/1101532563020148737?s=20
---
I have a prime receiver for sale for said weapon
---
Can you include whether the mod can be bought from vendor, and which ones :)?
---
Yep got one in the locker room in the clubhouse.
---
I’m not selling the sign itself but pm me and I could get you the finals this week
---
Alright I think a two shot will be perfect
---
You get it for free if you do the escavator mission or buy it from a vendor, I think the enclave vendor sells it. Doubt people have extras unless duped
---
In the long term yes she will be become irrelevant because that is the nature of online games that constantly introduce new content/endgame activities. Eventually Bethesda will nerf her and make it so a lv 50 can solo her though that might be years from now. Of course this is dependant on the life span of the game.
---
For now the bugs make it to iffy to spend the hour or so of time to launch a nuke then hope you don't get inflicted with any of the bugs or a simple server disconnect that nullifies all your hard work and ammo spent. Don't get me wrong I like fighting the SBQ it's actually fun, when it works.
---
This post is boring.
---
Because people are quite content being led by the nose plot point to plot point, where they make "important" decisions that have a laughable impact. 
---
Where 76, is exactly how you described it. You're not following a story, you're creating one, all the other "questlines" are just things to enrich your story. It's what makes 76 so great for RP and what not. 
---
No... however the Ultracite Gatling Laser just melts Scortchbeasts. I'm pretty sure it does 100% additional damage so basically a better version of Bloodied. Then you can mod it with a Prime receiver for an added boost. Do not toss or scrap it. Its a very strong rare weapon. 
---
Not to mention your hand isn’t in the hand it’s inside the forearm of the PA mod.
---
Nope, no legendary version.
---
I always try and deliver care packages to low level players, unfortunately this 90% of the time results in standing by the paper bag jumping, emoting and shooting at the bag... All so that they can just ignore me and walk away without any stimpacks, purified water, or plans.
---
Still feels good though when the 10% are smart enough to figure out what's going on pick up the package and emote hearts or thumbs up. 
---
Jesus dude chill, it’s just an ask. 
---
Yeah and a bos I think 
---
Eh, most players don't know how to kill other players so typically you can get away with a lot. But yeah pretty much any competitive PvP build is going to use stealth boys or phantom devices.
---
Have you found any mods for the BOS ultracite armor? 
---
Do you really need to be in power Armor all of the time? I don’t don mine unless I am heading into a nuke zone or if I need my excavator armor’s carry capacity 
---
I have an explosive 50 cal with +30% damage versus super mutants. I run a full heavy weapons / power armor build. I call this gun the Mutant Fucker 3000, because that's what it does. I can clear West Tek in about 300 bullets. It's insane.
---
Bottom line: go heavy weapons.
---
Ok thanks
---
People are followers. Go here go there. Be the quest. Ask that rando to bring you 50 springs or help kill that beast for some cap or scraps or even legendary item. You. Are.the.npc.now. 
---
Down voted. Delete the game and go away if you don't like it. Nobody really cares if you play or not. 
---
Ok, the explosion chain reaction is surprising result. That seems like it would be hard to keep track of. Another idea to test when you get around to it, what if the target does some minor damage to a car then the attacker comes along and hits it until it starts burning. I’m wondering if the game tracks damage to a car the same way it does an enemy and anyone that tags it will get credit for the ‘kill’. So if the target player hit it with a stray shot, when it does explode from someone else also hitting it, it’s counted as self-inflicted. 
---
I think hunger/thirst is bugged, but I also thought you meant it when you said you had assworms lol. 
---
I’ve been doing the same thing. From my tests. .45 is a good contender. With bandolier it’s neigh weightless and can be used with a good selection. 5.56 is close but with bandolier it’s 0.01 and 1000 round adds up. 5mm is also in there being weightless but only so few guns use it. 
---
It's a super minor point, but I kind of wish they did the Sims thing where you "level up" your musical skills as you play.  When you start, you're awful at it.  But the more regularly you do it, the better the music becomes. 😂
---
That great for you and all, but you realize that the average person leveling won't have an amazing legendary weapon that perfectly fits their build, right? 
---
Very good idea
---
Why wouldn’t you want players with similar stats on the same server? Pvp is absolutly useless unless you’re a similar level to the other person.
---
For sure - those dudes cant even get along. Always griefing each other while we're just kicking back sipping old possum and watching the fireflies.
---
I really haven’t noticed such a big drop in legendary items but I’m still getting trash drops from 3 star
---
I can see where your coming from
---
I'm noticing a huge drop in encounters with legendary enemies period.
---
Is this...balance? 
---
Except some builds just don't have good perks to deal with this. Sure melee weapons have incisor and rifles have tank killer, but pistols? They don't have anything beyond the basic damage boosting perks, which aren't enough. 
---
Alright , have you considered testing player traps? Like the rad trap and flmaethrower trap?
---
I bought if from grahm about 3 days ago.
---
Probably just a thought that came out of his snack sized brain.
---
I let that hatred put me off buying the game for months. I got a used copy for $20 at a local game store and I love it
---
The difference, for me at least; I like to show it off! And some of the stuff is really cool and completes my CAMP. I’ve got a bar and like the signs. Haven’t spent a lot of money, but I don’t feel guilty spending what I have. 
---
I draw the lines at frames due to me playing on console, can only have so many pictures, and the fact they’re only for my personal loading screens. Can’t really share the frames with friends unless I was going to be “that guy” that downloads them and sends them out personally over Social Media.  
---
Just my opinion I suppose 
---
She's scaling to maximum capacity. Read more about it here in a thread i made recently: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/auf1pc/psa\_scortched\_beast\_queen\_postpatch\_and\_what\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/auf1pc/psa_scortched_beast_queen_postpatch_and_what_is/)
---
How did you accidentally dupe them ?
---
I don’t follow. But going back to the basics might help?
---
I'd love some 3 star trash. Wood armor has been particularly common for me recently
---
I have. But chalked it up to the stealth nerf. Seeing as how everyone just buys their gear now. Why have more legendary mobs. 
---
Is this laser cut, CNC, or by hand? I could also use the plans for it!
---
they fixed that. mods on weapons work now. 
---
&gt; slow US internet speeds.
---
*Laughs in Australian*
---
I think it might well be something. Not sure I'd call it balance
---
You modded it?? Oopsie!! 
---
Im melee with a touch of rifle. So I shoot her down and do most of my damage on the ground.
---
Laser cut though I can send the files and could be cnc’d too
---
Okay awesome, I’ll come back in a month . Thanks!
---
The thing that bothers me the most is that you can lockpick in power armor but you can't do any crafting. So which is it? Either you can make tiny hand motions or you can't.
---
And if you can lockpick for some lore-friendly reason like, it's an attachment to the power armor, then why do I have to equip a perk card? 
---
Not sure. What happened is that I put down an empty chasis to put the level 45 pieces on it, transferred the pieces over, game said I couldn't pick up the chasis due to being "too low level" so I took the pieces off and picked up the chasis. Traded the pieces to my teammate so I could get them for my low level, and when I was able to equip and use the PA pieces later, I had two of each. It was fuckin weird
---
Maybe I’ll play just to see what they got.
---
You take this too seriously lol
---
The real reason it gets boring is it's very hard to find a good reason to repeatedly play the story (which I would hope everyone by now knows that it's told through the environment instead of just giving it to you) the only end game part of the story worth repeating is nuking areas like whitespring and the sbq and even those become boring grinds. Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoy the entirety of the game even when it was broken to high hell on launch. The game just doesn't really give a reason to keep playing afterwards, (except to collect better gear and such). Even now I like playing it but I definitely have to be in a certain mood to do it otherwise it's just boring. 
---
Sorry for format, I'm on mobile
---
Then why can you lockpick a lvl 3 safe while still in power armor?
---
Unlocking my workshop stuff doesn't work for me on Xbox. I know how to lock and see the option to have no lock but it doesn't work 
---
Not sure why Bethesda keeps trying to enter the merchandise market when no one was asking for licensed Fallout gear, but at least this reply was funny
---
5mm with the Gatling gun is awesome until you have to  repair your gun
---
Yeah, I'm in a similar boat to this.  Part of me wants to believe that they'll eventually revisit the individual nerfs of Two-Shot and Explosive and make it so the nerf applies to the pair.  I have my doubts, though.
---
This has happened to me too. I wonder if it happens because of the Feed the People &amp; Back on the Beat events triggering simultaneously when you fast travel there.
---
White springs has a lot of camp items. Grafton responder boy has excavator mod plans. Watoga super duper mart has all power armor besides xo1 mod plans. All the train stations have various weapons and building plans. Makes it easy to get whatever you want especially since plans now say if they are known or not.  
---
I made my camp in the form of a boarding house and church  (whole story behind it) right at the overseer' s camp just to help new players with a leg up and a safe place to sleep and craft.
---
Eventually have divergent servers?  Where you could choose to be on a co-op, rebuilding server versus a raider wasteland?
---
So you can run into someone who is different from you? That’s half the enjoyment of other players to me: seeing how different people are choosing to play this game. If we only got grouped with like-minded players, it would be pretty boring.
---
You can't have 8 levels in each attribute.
---
You can only have 50.
---
Which is a skill point you get every Lvl you go up from 1 to 50. You can't have 8 points in every attribute
---
Hmmm. I just don't see why it would have been nerfed. Farming is one of the few things left for high level players. Unless it has something to do with 'the Purveyor' and preemptively adjusting legendary rates...
---
Elon is just trying to divert attention from him being a terrible person tho
---
I regularly see 150-200 quoted... You get what you get out of a game. 60+ on main 150 + sides exploration is pretty solid in its segment... Games end... mmos don’t. Your expectations are off. it still crushes destiny, destiny 2, anthem, and most shoot looters in content... execution I can see where it’s subjective. I see level 100s who just grinded white springs and stick to small loop and haven’t even seen the crashed space station. Idk I’m 80 hrs in and just getting started. 
---
O.....kay.
---
That'd be so awesome. Thank you so much. Are you thinking about painting it at all?
---
It is not that much grinding. It goes a lot faster with additional characters. I started taking workshops and doing events. You can get several plans an hour or more just doing that. Besides you can swap plans between characters. 
---
Am I missing something here? When I had food troubles I’d go back to 76 and start there. Even with my current character. 
---
Well don't be a dick about it, most of the mods available are QoL and if they aren't it's just visual.
---
That guy is off his face!
---
Level 80 and only ever gotten 1 x 3 star legendary item, and it was rubbish.
---
Absolutely love the game, but the grind is just too much sometimes.
---
Yeah many people hoard legendaries they never end up using
---
Actually, heavy leather is the best armor atm. It has like 10% less DR than metal but insanely way more ER. Point for point, heavy leather is strongest armor (for some reasons). 
---
have you fixed back both the one where the game is and also the one in "drive:\\username\\My Games\\Fallout 76"
---
that did it for me...
---
&gt; This one really does seem to be an "eventually" job, friend.
---
If this is a joke, you might want to let us all in on it.
---
Don't need a damage buff, huh? Max level alien blaster with standart mag does 20 damage, with fusion cells - 15. Max level top energy handgun from all series can't kill 1lvl radroach in one shot!!! It is ridiculous! Plasma rifle (one of the top energy rifles in whole series) with sniper barrel, two shot legendary effect, maxed rifleman perks and bloody mess have ~86/86 ballistic/energy damage. It's useless crap. 
---
Still think that damage buff is not necessary?
---
Interesting evaluation. So it would appear by your experience that the queen is in fact not scaling, but has already scaled to a very high level. This would support the issues with the higher failure rates. There doesn't seem to be much that Bethesda is interested in fixing for the queen other than to make her the "ultimate" trash fight for an achievement unlock. Perhaps in the March extension they'll reduce the health and damage of her for a tougher boss. But what you include in your post is pretty consistent with what I've experienced as well post patch. 
---
In the custom folder it should look vaguely like this,
---
Cripple her legs on the ground. Then smash her face.
---
So play as glass canon one-shot build is a dick move?
---
IT would ask you if after you successfully hit the target, did you take off VATS and turn VATS back on again and see if that shows the proper numbers? 
---
What was your loot drop and how many stars?
---
I got one yesterday in Watogo in a world container....but until they add the Sunburst jumpsuit, I think I'll just have to stash it.
---
Remember the xp farm? Prob did that for a few hundred levels.
---
That too. I also assumed maybe be people are farming too much and the system is having trouble filling less popular areas. 
---
Well when you cherry pick the one weapon that needs it yes. 
---
Every other energy weapon in the game is shit only because armor piercing doesn't work with energy resistance for some random reason. 
---
Plasma Rifles destroy with the Flamer barrel. 
---
Gatling Plasma's / Laser's destroy anything without Armor (because of the whole Armor issue stated above). 
---
Energy Rifles even though they break in 2 seconds destroy all sentinel/cavalier builds because of the splitter mod causing almost 100% stagger rates. 
---
Bethesda has also already stated numerous times that all energy weapons are getting a balance pass. Don't argue with me when its not my fault Bethesda is taking there sweet ass time. 
---
What about weapon mods? 
---
The bed and breakfast
---
You can use a piece of chameleon armor or weightless with the mutation to achieve a similar effect.
---
Yeh it is. I was mathing the 8x7 is 56 referencing off the pic 
---
Yes this is so true. WS is THE place we all go for legendarys and we want more of this. Pls extend to another place, or 2,3,4  we can farm shit we need/want.
---
Is it the gazebo with the sign saying "The Springhouse"? Next to the tennis court?
---
Do it
---
I don’t either lol
---
Like I keep saying.... if they were invested in keeping the modder community engaged and making content that can enrich and extend the game for everyone with content, then they'd develop a Sponsored Mod program where they pay modders for certain qol and large content quality mods. Ah well, such a missed opportunity and wealth of resource to tap.
---
I had a similar issue a few weeks ago on my main character. I had a couple missle turrets that would not shot no matter the scenario. After storing them, deleting them, rewiring them, and moving them I still could not get them to work. 
---
What eventually fixed the problem was paying to relocate my entire C.A.M.P. and rebuilding it from scratch. Now my turrets actually work!  (Only now my new C.A.M.P. is plagued by enemies spawning directly inside my home and my generator room)
---
True. If you farm the right places enough you do eventually get some decent gear but it's such a time commitment and farming isn't fun. It badly needs the new content 
---
You start with 1 point at each stat. To get 8 point you should add 7 more points. 7 points * 7 stats = 49 points
---
600 caps?
---
You guys are awesome! I was fresh out the vault and a friendly guy in a Silver Shroud outfit dropped me some meds and supplies. I was worried about dealing with griefers at first so I’m glad there’s good players out there.
---
Don't show things like players killed, or deaths.  That only breeds stat whores, especially if it's public in the format of KDR.  Everything else is probably fine.
---
I agree that BGS had a lot that was expected from them and their release of 76. From my perspective, I was on board with the hype for 76. I pre-ordered the digital copy for $60 on the Xbox. I was disappointed with the problems, but decided to set it down for a while and come back later after it's received some love. That being said, I'm cautious towards pre-orders now. Maybe it lowered people's expectations and prepared them for the possibility that it could be a hollow or broken game upon release making it easier to cope with. That's been my personal experience though. 
---
In the last two days I was farming Watoga Civic and Emergency and got like 3-4 3* items. I played like 3 hours a day. To be honest I don’t know if that’s a normal number or if it was higher pre-patch. What I am 100000% sure is that Whitesprings has been nerfed in the last patch. I got 3-4 legendary items per run pre-patch. Right now, I get nothing at all or 1-2 items max. This is not bad rng, I did a good amount of runs but stopped eventually cause it just doesn’t make any sense anymore to farm there imo.
---
Harvey Danger said it best: "if you're bored then you're boring"
---
I just hope it means we can put food items on display too. Be pretty cool having a full rad-turkey dinner setup next November
---
Sure? It’s literally the only gazebo on the property lol
---
What do u mean by the point? Like overblown something/ report on it/ or hype it? 
---
I am not defending 76, this game was broken at lunch no doubt, but I think the expectations of fixing it in one or two patches was an impossible task and if it wasn’t for the amount of coverage this game got some of this bugs would been unknown to your average player and given Bathesda Austin some time to fix them in the background. 
---
The game already had hate for being multiplayer and not a single player game like the fans wanted.
---
Any way good or bad hopefully the rest of developers will think twice before launching an incomplete game.
---
They probably just shut the doors so nothing else other than you got it in and trashed the place, in the knowledge you could just fast travel out when you’d finished. 
---
Unfortunately there isn’t an  “I’m off now, would you kindly piss off please?”, emote. 
---
The damage does need a buff though. A lvl 50 hardened combat rifle does 50 damage, a laser rifle only 40 because it doesn't get significant receiver upgrades. Not to mention it lacks piercing mods other guns have.
---
I like to have lots of variety, and meeting low level players is a fun experience in my mind. I wouldn't want to be in a server where everyone is alike, things could potentially become boring
---
8 steel &amp; 6 aluminum something like this ;)
---
I think I got a \*\* combat armor left leg both times.
---
You've only finished when you're done playing.  Story-wise, yes killing the Scorchbeast queen is the end goal.
---
Agree hopefully this will be a warning to developers.
---
It was *changed* in Patch 5.  The jury is still out on whether or not it was intentional.  There are definitely instances where it really doesn't seem to be.  You'll be in a \[Caution\] state when there's absolutely nothing around you.
---
It is worth noting that robots tend to have better detection senses than other NPCs.

I've had mixed results "keeping" her on the ground using various means - attacking her legs, shooting up her wings, cryo grenades, other people using cryolators. The first time around today she got stuck in the air at one point, flapping her wings but not moving - which made it harder to do as much damage as quickly, but it also meant she wasn't generating adds, apparently. The second time, she landed early on, and just started chasing one of my teammates, rather than take off again - no special effort to keep her on the ground needed.
---
I’m so sure I’ve seen your GT in my server and I NEED to pay you guys a visit as least out of admiration for your sales pitch!
---
Yep that’s it
---
Use enforcer to cripple her wings, no wing swipe, her arms, no claw attack. She just lays there and takes it. My team and i can take her down in 2 landings.  Cripple everything.
---
Oh people farm far too much, myself included, but until the new content arrives there isn't much to do. And if there has been a change I wish they'd actually say so 
---
The best part of this game is the coop. 
---
The worst part is being 1 shot by high level arseholes! 
---
Thanks for the reply.  That's what my research has found as well.  I guess we have to wait for another patch and keep our fingers crossed.   I will ask him to make a support ticket to try and get it higher up on their radar.
---
You got to get rid of those ass-worms immediately or you will lose food and water very quickly. I have the speed demon mutation and if I get a parasite the food bar will drop super fast. Best thing to use is the fountain at whitesprings to cure all diseases.
---
From the golf course spawn point turn right and walk pass the tennis court towards the ghoul rooms.
---
Turn right again before going up the hill towards the gazebo.
---
The water fountain in on a wall opposite the gazebo
---
I dunno man I'd say it's only figuratively amazing
---
I don't run a shotgun build, but I do run a heavy gun build with One Gun Army.
---
That sResourceArchive2List setting is pre-patch 5/6. It changed. Search Reddit for the update since patch 5/6.
---
It’s plausible. We could be the great greats of someone from the future games. Hell I rp that I’m the brother of Randell dean Clark from FNV Honest Hearts. 
---
I disagree in favor of a large buff. Energy rifles have burning damage and access to splitter mods that give them god tier stagger chance. For pvp they are way better despite breaking in 4 seconds. If the durability was fixed everyone would be using them instead. 
---
Energy Rifles serve a different purpose. 
---
If this game had a more Rock/DR, Paper/ER, Scissors/RD approach. Then refactoring all weapons damage would be something i'd be on board with. 
---
How would platform have anything at all to do with this problem?
---
Everything is more fun when you have other people to play with.
---
So the Fallout equivalent of SBMM?
---
Uh, no, fuck that. That's stupid.
---
The world of shops that nobody leaves. The world Workshop lovers where no workshops are ever available. The world of nuke launching SBQ hunters, where someone is always launching a nuke while you’re halfway through the silo. 
---
I did something similar yesterday, I did know the guy IRL though, gave him 80 diluted stimpacks and 3,000 .38 ammo
---
Can you do calibrated shocks and jet pack for t51, and I'd so how much, I don't have any flux 
---
Who knows. Time to change up play style. Be a raider and mess up people. Be a traveling merchant. Be a hitman. The sky’s the limit. 
---
The sulphur water fountain only gets rid of diseases when a nuke has been dropped it is in the Fallout zone. It becomes a regular water fountain otherwise.
---
Just use the Chemist perk and craft some disease cure.
---
Ahhh that makes sense. So checking how many people on the server before nuking is probably a good call if your simply looking to farm for xp and leg.
---
Yes, I did. I just took the picture showing that there was a sneak attack so you could tell I hit it. I check again later after exiting and re-entering VATS and there was no change
---
What time are we talking? I am in Australia, will need to calculate time zone difference, plus I don’t have a Twitter account. But would love to hang out and watch ( kick me if I am taking up server space for legit players) I watched the last one, and almost died laughing. 
---
No, they exist. I’m pretty sure I have one on my T-60, and I’ve never gone into the dev room.
---
This.
---
And I’d love the opportunity to be the guy with the TSE for once. 
---
They do exist, no, really they do..
---
Honest..  Just not in my universe unfortunately. 
---
Hey, launched a few nukes (at whitesprings and prime) and not seen this tape, probably because I fast traveled, is it in the overseer cache at the entrance to the bunkers?
---
Wearing this one since short after launch. :) 
---
There are perk cards for reducing hunger and thirst. They really help and I recommend using then. Cannibal perk also let's you eat mutants, scorched, ghouls, and mole miners. A lot of what you're describing can be taken care of using perk cards.
---
It would be cool if the scorched get defeated making it so human npcs come to West Virgina, along with new challenges.
---
Those plans do not, have never, appeared in a levelled list in any version of the game files since BETA. They have never been able to drop in the game. You must have grabbed the plan from a trade or container where someone else placed it.
---
I've only ever used what I've acquired legitimately from my own drops/crafting. In the battle vs duped weapons they destroyed my TS guass rifle. I don't follow forums, I just play the game. Logging in to suddenly realize I can't kill shit anymore and it's not even worth farming up lead for ammo, or that I now have to level many more times to rearrange my skill points? It already took 25 hits to bring down a SB, now it's 50. 
---
As always, you get punished for playing a game properly, but the dupers don't give a shit since they didn't work for it in the first place. Yeah, I'm done with this dumpster fire of a game.
---
The burning damage is incredibly weak, it's a non factor especially with everyone running fireproof. And a shotgun with enforcer is much better. There's zero reason to use the laser rifle.
---
Bethesda likes to connect the main characters of their games: a little bit in TES and a lot in Fallout (a lot of characters reappear in 4), so maybe they will eventually tie 76 back into 3 like this.
---
Maybe. Ive got foundations built perfectly around my mineral extractor, and they probably intersect with it in places. Beth devs might have introduced an update to camps where this is no longer possible.
---
Yeah post-patch shes fully scaled to the max. Basically post patch you need everyone in your team to carry 3-4x the amount of DPS to take her down. I noticed the difference when i tried to test my theory by attacking her solo. 
---
Now you have to have at least 8 people or more with min/max'd setup's that know how to bypass her 300 armor or at least exceed 300 damage per bullet/swing to do significant enough damage to see her health even budge. 
---
I'm not discrediting the people either who have managed to bug her out of her "leash zone" like i described in my thread. 
---
I don't even bother trying to kill her anymore. I just farm the add's for exp and the few 3 star legendaries that appear during the fight. I even tell everyone in area chat to ignore the Queen and i purposely tank her so everyone can just focus on the add's. Even the add's are spawning at maximum capacity. So consider for the time being the Queen as just an EXP farm until Bethesda fixes her. 
---
Where the hell did they get it then? It’s my understanding that you can only get into the dev room on PC, and I’m on PS4...
---
No
---
If you are level 25+ do Miner Miracles to unlock Power Armor stations.
---
Stash size increased to 800
---
AAE/TSE/IE
---
Yeah we had a couple of legendaries show up. I think had a fog crawler 2* and a 1* deathclaw. 
---
Just to clarify, it's Watoga Emergency Services on the map, not always a wendigo, and usually a legendary but sometimes just a "boss" enemy (with a crown next to its name and extra loot)
---
But yet we can manipulate lock picking tools
---
Or you could look at it as the world where shops become bustling market squares, people actual contest workshops, and you always have a competent group for the Queen.
---
Anti Armor Explosive / Two Shot Explosive / ??
---
IE = Instigating Explosive 
---
PC mods can cause issues with perks. There are bugs that effect only certain systems. 
---
You know, I hate that DMV quest but I totally had fun waiting in line chatting with everyone! I especially liked the part where the security detail played Atom Shop music for us all as we waited.
---
Wow super quick reply, thanks :)
---
I've recently discovered that several stats are tracked under the challenges tab. 
---
No problem!
---
Same thing happens to me. I join event, travel to it, then nothing. 
---
I assumed I was doing it wrong. 
---
One time the legendary was in the vicinity of the start location, but other than that it’s just me wasting caps to travel to nothing. 
---
I like this theory a lot. Here’s hoping we get more connections with the capital wasteland in the wastelanders update coming. I’ve seen a note left by some ghouls that headed to the Underworld.
---
Or at least track item values for duping
---
I don’t mean *only* like minded players. I just mean some better level matchmaking. I love helping other players too, but I do also wish there was a bit more pvp. I’m only level 36 so pvp is absolutly pointless for me. Once I get to higher levels it might pick up a bit, I’m not sure. But I wish there were more people around my level that I could fight without getting one shotted by a deathclaw gauntlet. It just seems like every world I load into everyone is level 80+. I’d just like some people to fight in a fair contest is all
---
Okay thank you 
---
Well... Idontknow
---
Most games don't have auto-run for controllers (at least I don't know any game that has)/ I guess it's a convention/tradition thing. Maybe there aren't enough buttons on a game-pad.
---
Congrats, I'm 400+ hours into the game and have still never ran into a Flatwoods monster.  
---
Not to me, but to the Original poster. It is dismissive and rude to write off a detailed and interesting post with the acronym TL:DR.
---
Anyway that's my opinion obviously, we shall have to agree to disagree. Peace Out.
---
I've only done it solo :(
---
That line in your edit is wrong.
---
Also don't edit the Fallout76.ini
---
The Fallout76Custom.ini and Fallout76Prefs.ini is all you need to modify settings.
---
Delete Fallout76.ini in installation directory AND documents. Run launcher scan and repair to make it redownload.
---
Most ive had was 6 in a silo. We all went down the elevator one at a time to stop any diassapearance/elongated limbs and it was fine. But you realize that the more people you have the more bots spawn right? Watch this https://youtu.be/FkK4KEob-yU for tips 👍
---
I mentioned the burning damage for PvE. Its actually quiet strong though. Depends the player. Not everyone uses fireproof anymore now that explosive legendaries got nerfed so hard. 
---
The thing that puts Energy Rifles apart from regular rifles is the splitter mod to stagger from a distance. Enforcer Shotguns are the best weapon for close-medium ranged engagements. Where Energy Rifles trump medium-long range engagements for pvp. 
---
Stating it has 0 use is kinda arrogant, no offense. I have a friend who uses a sniper/splitter bloodied/vats-crit Energy rifle and he can 2-3 shot people from miles away in full sentinel/cavalier assassin setup's. He's usually the sniper for my team when we pvp with other teams. Just sucks that his rifle breaks after 5 or so kills. 
---
I didn’t even trade for it. It’s gotta be in the world somewhere. I’ll link a pic of it
---
24
---
Is easiest way 👍
---
All I know is that I got it from a mod, not the plans.
---
You think they would have seen the cluster F of Fo76 and put a bit more effort into it lol
---
And what did you do after the Queen? That's the problem.
---
Forget about energy weapons, poor minigun is still dogshit and got nerfed into the ground since the tse nerfs
---
The mods for those do exist and can drop or be purchased sometimes at vendors. But not the plans.
---
New meta build: super mutant + melee + stealth, sneak behind enemies and 1 hit b\*tch slap 'em to death.
---
Smh why didn’t you say so? That means they do exist.
---
There is a vault that has this in place. I think it’s in fallout new Vegas. Not sure. 
---
I've had quiet a few 3 star's. 3 star glowing gulpers, 3 star stingwings. Generally only showing up after the 15 minute mark. 
---
Its quiet fun to have everyone bunker in the DropSiteV9 for a change and then all the enemies bundle at the door then we run out to kill everything and reset. 
---
Just telling what’s what
---
People place duped dev room items/plans in containers, especially frequently accessed containers, all the time.
---
Ohhhh wait I read that wrong. You did say the plans don’t exist, not the mod. My bad dude.
---
Don't let people tell you wether or not to buy atoms
---
Lmaaaaoooooo
---
&gt; Its a very strong rare weapon.
---
...unless you just craft it, lol
---
Seems like a waste of space without knowing exactly how the system will work. They're unlikely to go with 1:1 trades because that's too easily spamable even if they add a cap fee. If they're smart it should end up being more like a point system with each star value being worth more toward a final purchase. If that's the case you could just turn in masses of one star items. 
---
Sorry, I missed your title, I stopped reading at "plan". My mistake.
---
Wasn’t my title, all good dude
---
I’ve done this too.  The 2 bodies outside v76 and have included the overseers camp.
---
Personally, I prefer a 3 star lvl 45 Quad Explosive Double Barrel with reload speed and reduced weight.
---
Use all shotgun perks in STR if you can. (12 points I believe)
---
Use Skeet Shooter in PER. (3)
---
Use Demo Expert in INT. (5)
---
Use Enforcer in AGI. (3)
---
Enforcer is your clutch card, but it’s dependent upon the explosive factor of the shotgun so having explosive as a legendary star is a must. 
---
I run this and love it like no other.
---
Haven't played around with it in 76 yet, but in FO4 it was probably one of the most fun weapons to screw around with, once you can figure out how to predict its ridiculous trajectory lol 
---
I was gone say the whole point of the game is to lunch a Nuke lol we been knowing that. 
---
I've never seen an Ultracite Gatling Laser plan before. I have the Prime Receiver for the Ultracite Gatling Laser. The one that shoots green lasers. 
---
 Just to be clear, Ultracite Gatling Lasers are different from regular Gatling Lasers. You know this correct? Just making sure because most people don't know there is 2 distinct variations of the Gatling Laser. 
---
If there is a Ultracite Gatling Laser plan i gotta get me one of those and start handle them out during Queen fights. They are very powerful even without perks. 
---
No body tho
---
It’s a kiddie game compared to the original fallouts. That’s a fact 
---
I feel the same way I run a VERY targeted build (max stealth with optic camouflage armor and 2 maxed out sniper rifles plus a silenced instigating automatic shotgun for CQC, and an instigating black powder rifle for one shotting really powerful enemies) so I hoard .50 cal, .45 cal, shotgun shells, and 5mm ball but i also take every last bit of ammo i find. Just this week i did my second mass giveaway to the lowest level player I could find on the server that day. 10,000+ rounds of ballistic ammo, nearly 3,000 rounds of energy ammo, and several hundred rounds of explosive ammo plus some fusion and plasma cores, even sliced off 400+ of my shotgun shells since he really needed some) 
---
Funny thing was when I went to meet him I got to the area first but he couldn't find me because i forgot i spend nearly every moment in fallout crouched for my chameleon armor so he couldn't find me on the map. But after i stood up he and his buddy (another higher level player taking him around which in itself is awesome) showed up and grabbed all the ammo. We exchanged "happy hunting!" and they were off and I was back to lone wanderering my way through 76.
---
I'm thankful I was blessed enough to get this game in beta and have had the opportunity to give away nearly 30,000 rounds of ammo since i started and still maintain the 3,000 to 6,000 rounds of the specific ammo I actually use. Its so much fun knowing other people are enjoying the game more. Especially starting out when it can be a little overwhelming with everything you have to learn to manage having just ONE less thing to worry about (e.g. running out of ammo) means they can focus on enjoying the environment and gameplay. That in itself is incredibly rewarding because i have been having nothing less than a blast with this game since day 1 of the xbox beta and i hope i can help others experience the same enjoyment.
---
Personally, I think maybe one more stash increase and we’ll be at the sweet spot (maybe cut it off at 1000?). But so far 800 seems to be a good spot for the time being, at least for me. If they worked on increasing the camp limit now instead, I’d prefer this much more. 
---
Me too. Used to get random freezes in Charleston, Grafton (when the monster was up), Pleasant Valley (rarely). Still need to take a trip to the enclave bunker.
---
Your method is bogus. See how many hits they take with and without. Works last time I tested it. 
---
Well, in the name of strong international relationships, I think we can fit you in. You will have to fight your way onto the server, but message me your PSN name. However, if you're in the audience, you must have a mic and be willing to play if picked and have some laughs on the mic because we're recording again. 
---
same thing happened to me onces, but instead of 3k 45 rounds, its was close to 100 fusion cores lol 
---
It took them 4 years to fix the power armor bug. A stats page is too much to ask for
---
It's at the entrance of the silo, not inside.  I found it before I even launched a nuke because someone else on the server had :/
---
Yes I can. 600 for a jetpack, 300 per leg
---
Fallout 3 exept everyone knew it was a vault simulation but thats better than the radioactive hellhole outside. Then the overseer went mad with power and fuck with their memories.
---
Yeah I modded it. I only have inventory mods in though that make it easier to sort and such
---
Plasma grande the crap out of them seems to work. When ever I go to westek to farm I throw a few in the room full of mutants and then finish them up with rifle.  Laser don’t do crap and neither small caliber.
---
Well I did get duplicate plans from her. I was out treasure hunting and found a level 5 so dropped all my ultracite plans on him lol
---
Loot should never be considered canon considering its randomly spawned
---
Winners don’t use drugs. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/dxP2pvw
---
Gotcha hadn't been Lvl 1 for so long forgot haha ;)
---
No, they spawn as objects in the overworld in a sink and on a counter. Not randomly spawned in a box.
---
Damn son! Is it capped at lvl35? The one i got is lvl45. Thats pretty cool though. Thanks for the screenshot. 
---
Shit that's a good idea! I've tried that damn thing probably 30 times and can't pass it- never thought about that!
---
Very cool. Always nice to see an upbeat experience instead of complaints. It put a smile on my face. Kudos!
---
No, it can be crafted at lvl45. I think I got the plan off of the SBQ, but I'm not positive because it was a while ago (back in Nov/Dec)
---
Hey Turd, we talked  a bit last week , do you have any full sets of lvl 15 raider PA? 
---
I'd assume it was from the SBQ. I got my weapon from the SBQ. I need to get that. 
---
Communist detected on American soil
---
Lethal force engaged 
---
Fuck gulpers! I wasted my grenade launcher on them and they act like is nothing. 
---
He's a pretty cool guy, too. He and a few other people helped me launch my first nuke and walked me through where to center it, then helped me take out the SBQ. It was way easier than I'd expected it to be, but I owe that to having a really experienced and well trained group with me. 
---
That's a decent drop rate as far as I'm concerned, but I'm getting literally nothing haha. Yeah I rarely bother with Whitesprings even when it's nuked. I understand why it's been nerfed but surely it'd make sense to buff other locations to balance?
---
Is that why I survive those encounters and they don't?
---
I wish I could relocate my points I seriously mess up my build. 
---
Do you have any level 15 PA? I have some Snack Cakes.
---
I remember thanks lol god only knows how many hours I have wasted reading fallout lore out of the wiki.
---
I need to check my alt for that. 
---
this game is full of bugs, but I have not seen anyone besides you talking about this issue...  and as you suggested in a reply to me earlier I did do a [search](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=endangerol&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=top) of this sub, the top voted results are all PSAs about how well it works against the SBQ
---
As a low level player Ive been very grateful for two folks stopping to drop some better armor and weapons for me today alone.
---
Thank you to everyone who does this! 
---
holy shit this has to be the hottest take i've ever seen on reddit, this world is collapsing in on itself
---
I was trying to do a reference to old school arcade machines that would have that massage. This old man fail lol 
---
Either way, just be on the safe side and don’t :)
---
Thanks! I'll even take an incomplete set I'm burnt out on trying to find it naturally. 
---
Pretty sure in April 
---
Swapping decks would be nice for combat but I think crafting should be no cost, any degree of swapping for crafting is tedious and unnecessary as it does not affect the balance of the game to have these perks constantly on.
---
Yes absolutely, I’d love to farm more than 3 locations over and over. Of course there are other places with legendary spawn potential but with the current drop rates for 3* items being so low, Watoga is still the best with 3-4 minutes per run. 
---
Well that's a bit too long but ok
---
Tired of going on an adventure and coming back to find all of my tato plants need to be repaired and I have no tatoes left. Smh. Lemme put these bad boys inside 
---
what wolf said, you might have to do a few reloggs first though cus not 100% spawn in his invetory
---
Yep, player vending machines will also come out in april
---
This is why I haven’t wasted my time trying to make more beacons for the air strikes/ orbital strikes. Too much work not worth the farming. 
---
If you're having doubts, you're probably gonna have a bad time with the Game. Have you thought about upgrading your rig? I upgraded mine to make sure it runs smooth. Worth saving some spare cheddar to upgrade your weaker components
---
On low-medium settings I think you can
---
I suggested this: at level 1 we get one deck and 30 another and 50 the final one. We can swap decks when not in combat and once every 2-3 minutes. We can name them and favourite cards to populate them. And name them. Mainly. Combat, Utility, and Crafting. Makes the system more dynamic and easier to use and enjoy. 
---
Server wide silo run, here I come!
---
Hopefully someone from Bethesda sees this because horde events are wildly inconsistent. Some will spawn a horde right on the event marker, others will tell you to search 4 locations in order to determine the source of the horde. Those locations often have a hard time of triggering as "searched". Something can get funky with fast travel too, I remember once fast traveling to a horde event only to spawn underwater in some random tunnel in the flooded mine. 
---
I’d raise the amount of crops you get from base plants and lower the planters. Still works. 
---
To confirm your observation, I just claimed the Federal Disposal Field, Plan reward was *Lion Statue* that I already knew. Then once I defended the workshop from the SpamBeasts and Super Mutant I received amongst other things a plan for *Lion Statue.*
---
So plan are definitely taken from a limited list and repeats are a given. Thanks again :)
---
That is a brilliant combination of the gas sign and “welcome home sign”
---
Check that level 3 locked trailer at Gorge Junkyard
---
I remember i was at Poseidon getting some cores and lead from the extractors untill a level 87 appears there and just starts running around. Hes wanted with a 5 cap bounty and me thinking he was debuffed wince hes wanted try to kill him. To no ones surprise i lost BUT he didnt take my junk, (keep in mind this was before the increase in stash from 600 to 800 so i kept my exess stuff with me) and when i came back he just emoted the thumbs down and just walked around. I soon realised he was just taking the piss out of soneone that was hunting him down, he was similar level and was trying to kill me and had a explosive combat shotgun. I was just standing around witnessing a guy jump around over my lead extractor and it being destroyed by his hunter. (also he did so several times where he would destroy and fix the extractor)  and it went on for a few minutes so i then got my mic and asked "why are you trying to kill him?" asked cause he was using alot of ammo to be worth getting a handful of caps over it he simply said "hes wanted" where i felt dumb by not saying why i asked an obvious question but regardless we talked and the other guy got on and started freaking out once he noticed a high level level 100+ player watching from the top of the plant, he even went down to see the whole comotion and i laughed a bit when i heard the first guy start to worry and want to go back to squeare one and i was amuzed to say the least
---
&gt;every single source of information is a reddit post
---
Yeah my melee only build tried throwing knifes didnt work got mad and found out smashing works
---
Bummer I'm on PS4 I was looking forward to slowly walking back to my camp
---
I agree with this one wholeheartedly. It's a nice vault and the party atmosphere would be great for a social lobby!
---
it even has that little soccer field
---
I like this plan. I can only think of 2 decks being needed. “Home” &amp;”Adventure”. But maybe at level 50, I’ll think of a 3rd deck. Your suggestion is a good balance
---
I have been after a quad quad missle launcher with no luck cabt even find a double
---
I don't have rank 3 in lock pick homie. Thanks though. 
---
He favouriting feature for now would help tremendously. Deck could come at a later patch or dlc. Maybe a perk card game. 
---
.45 hands down 
---
I have been maining a sneak rifle build since launch and like others here I feel it is different from server to server. 
---
Sometimes escape artist works, sometimes it doesnt. Sometimes I will go in danger from 100 yards away, sometimes I'm constantly in caution. But these things remain constant until I log out and back in but since it is always a random server you never know if relogging will fix it.
---
I also feel like your hunger/thirst meters deplete faster/slower depending on the server. Something is definitely wonky since the last patch.
---
Yeah, I don't recall which one they are talking about above, that makes it seem like she died at some b&amp;b, but assuming you can find that one before getting to the endgame, then she definitely didn't die, because she leaves you a holo in response to launching nukes.
---
Oh okay.
---
Yeah but 25% damage beats 25% AP so haha
---
No worries mate 
---
LOL. One of my several Morrowind engines. I run OpenMW in Linux so I can just stay where I live. ;)
---
I’m assuming it’s just a glitch that you’re experiencing. Perhaps if you inform Bethesda they may be able to give you advice or fix similar issues on the next patch update. Hope it stops soon bud 
---
Me too, I've had good results with Watoga in general. I always include the random spawn just to the east and the one by the bridge too. One of the two often has a legendary. I was suspicious about the 3 star drop rates so I did a bunch of Horde Events and it was the same story every time -  3* enemy, 1 star item *sigh*
---
Go to Watoga, loads there.
---
That doesn’t prove anything though.  They can be implemented differently.
---
Did any of you ever find a fix for this? I can't remove my water or stimpacks from my stash.
---
Have you tested burnign damage? I have, and it's so small you can't see the hp bar move at all, even over the full duration of it, and it doesn't stack.
---
Thanks! I originally had the Welcome Home sign on the right side of the front of the work shop and the marquee arrows on the gas sign pointing towards the CAMP. Unfortunately, the lights on the arrows were way too bright and washed out the arrow itself, so I needed another solution. This worked out well.
---
Its a well known glitch atm, a patch or two ago Bethesda broke sneak. Relatively random as to when you will and wont be hidden or detected
---
Seems like it drops damage by 80% and kills you instantly. 
---
Eastern State Penitentiary
---
Oh I didn’t know about these two encounters! Thanks for the info, will check it out and include in my run!
---
I will buy atoms to support the game once i see if they are serious about it. Until now all we got were nerfs which made people quit.
---
Chill bro u taking this too hard
---
Found a few and tossed em a while back, they exist. 
---
Amusing. Beth can ridicule and make fun off how they lied to customers. That's the real troll. 
---
Yes. Seen one on a trader before so I can confirm.
---
I’ll go check it! Woooo!
---
How you download to your phone?
---
I'll very likely never buy atom. I'm afeared they'll like it too much and add pay-to-win items. 
---
I may have to borrow this for myself. I just finished my wall of corn
---
Sweet! Thank you! Now I just need to get my hands on one for Xbox one!
---
Have at it! :)
---
Seriously? Tag your shit as spoiler. 
---
There's a probability they will do it anyway
---
Dolly sods campground get a very frequent spawn, a couple server hops and youll find some there
---
Next you’ll be trying to sell me a half-empty cup and calling it half-full. 
---
I have yet to experience that. I was level 14 and a level 197 started attacking me in a train station. Before I realized what happened I was dead and my junk was gone. Quit for about a week.
---
Came back, reached 19, went to that golf course place and everything jumped from my level to 62's and a guy in this yellow power armor started sledgehammering me.
---
F this shit.
---
James was born in 101 
---
I have never had this happen to my planets, tho I do always put full fence and at least one turret. Of course it would be nice to have them planets, kinda like in those bunkers with UV lights and all but I think that current issue is with CAMP budget and how it would increase complexity of those.
---
You finish the game by successfully launching a nuke. That's it.  You don't have to launch it at fissure site prime, nor do you have to kill the queen.
---
It’s just a prank bro
---
This is how its done right! Helping and assisting costs nothing but can make a world of difference 
---
Buying their severely over-priced skins doesn't help.
---
No that i know. Recently bethesda added some animal, so maybe in the future it will also spawn as random event like the other tamables.
---
So they are tameable? Thank you.
---
 You should PM me if you want the files, I can hook you up.
---
No argue there
---
I do indeed have a mic
---
You have to understand why they aren’t supporting mods in this game, right?
---
You play morrowind on your phone? PM?
---
imo what it needs most is a range buff, i can deal with the lower damage and long reload time, but i should be able to at least be able drop it in flatwoods from the food workshop
---
You're still able to fast travel though? Still getting sneak crits? 
---
I have been noticing this as well (xb1) but able to ft. Sometimes it goes away so idk maybe the mothman is watch me. 
---
Considering none of that is even remotely impressive, and any build with half a Damage perk is going to have similar results, yes, your knives are terrible and are basically regulated to a side arm in any competitive build, if not completely useless. I have a melee build. People farming whitesprings will complain about anything really, so that’s not a good basis for any argument. I use a Bloodied Bowie Knife with Swing Speed that hits for 400-600, and it still falls behind a good ranged build just because people will kill everything before you get close. Nevermind the fact that any other melee weapon will get you the same results if not better. 
---
Outside of this test people have shot robots in watoga and the counted shots to kill after and there was no difference. I did this a few patches ago and endangerol did nothing.
---
We also need to prevent ppl building in Whitesprings.
---
I know the reference.  I grew up with those.
---
It often takes a couple minutes for the locations to appear on your map.
---
I would have no problem with the queen if the durability on weapons was higher. I break 4 weapons in a queen fight.That's insane. And i repair my items while having 28 INT if that counts to something.
---
What level where you when you solo’d it? I’m currently 46 and can never find people to give me a hand launching and haven’t tried to solo it yet.
---
 No, but it runs fine. Its more a technical exercise for me although some people have played the whole game on it.
---
 PM means private message.
---
No worries, they're next to each other so easy to incorporate. Truly random: anything from crickets to a mirelurk queen!
---
You can turn in honey to the robot at the giant teapot for a daily quest as well. 
---
Agreed. I just moved my garden indoors using campfires. It looks odd, but at least they move with the camp. 
---
Do you have the Excavator Targeting HUD?  Once I disabled it, the blue screens declined by 95%
---
Sure, gt same as user name, where do I find the stage?
---
I’ll keep hunting till I find you. What time zone are you?
---
Tried gritz  for the first time today, boy did I not like it. Has the texture of sand.
---
Yes I added butter and sugar.
---
I think I was around that level maybe a little higher. I didn't start any of the main quest till about lvl 40 because exploring is always more fun. 
---
But this was when the TSE was strong and I had a explosive pump with maxed demo card. Might be a little bit harder now. 
---
Now I understand okay Russian Hacker with a Engine in their phone
---
No he wasn’t 
---
Epic story. Even with all its flaws, Fo76 can still be a bit magical. Also how long were you on to take all 4 (I think) power plants? It's like an hours errand apiece. As a low level no less too.
---
You’d probably die before you could confirm the travelZ
---
So the mk III is wonky as shit but for some reason it doesn't work for anyone at first and then eventually, maybe days or server hops later it starts working. I have no idea what causes this or how to fix it but just keep trying them and eventually they will start working. To my knowledge once they start working they never revert back to broken for that character even after death or server hop or whatever.
---
It'd be great if they worked instantly but currently just keep at it.
---
Ahem-----&gt; https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/fallout-76/17849
---
I agree with you, screw farming! 
---
It's just the worst to hunt.
---
I tied using my artillery today. I tried it twice. First time was too close to work. I ran a ways away and it was too far.
---
Yup that’s one of the reasons why I haven’t touched the game in a long time.
---
Ok sweet I'll buy them
---
If I place 4 of them down.....they all should fire simultaneously. Just sayin
---
 I have tested my knives on 4 level 48 Gulpers. I have nothing that puts them down faster and if you have fought them you know their regen is crazy.
---
 I have 4 knives now, not just the Nocturnal. 
---
 I was being a bit silly with the 10mm Machine gun. I don't like it but I do understand with a nice drop any gun can be effective.
---
 I have 3 chars and about 160 levels among them. I play the game my way and have ignored most Legendarys in my character builds. 
---
 The one I have now is extremely robust both in and out of PA. His ability to kill stuff although not extreme is certainly at least as good as most of what I see go down. Certainly in the Nuke Zones I kill a lot of stuff very quickly.
---
 I don't believe you are correct about other melee weapons being better. I will find out over time though.
---
Make a request on the market, I'm sure someone has it. If you don't mind the ammo, the experimental mirv can be dropped and there is a fatman mirv mod sold at the top of the world station sometimes.
---
For this game to do well they need to simplify the nuke process. Makes me wonder what the vault raids will be like 
---
My power fist does 350 damage, all rise does about 320, feral charred ghouls (the chubby ones). I keep seeing other players  melee weapons at 500-700 damage
---
When will you be on
---
That’s once
---
And that’s twice 
---
West Virginia *
---
You had me until server placement. 
---
California time, PST. Look for a Boss invite. We're over max number of players on a server so fight till you get on. :)
---
I assume you're on PC and using mods? You need to update your Fallout76Custom.ini.
---
From a sticky comment on Better Inventory :
---
"The Feb 19 patch (Patch 6) changed the default value of sResourceArchive2List. Please update your Fallout4Custom.ini file as follows to ensure that the game continues to load atom shop content:
---
[Archive]
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, BetterInventory.ba2"
---
I just wonder why the mire and bog horde event are still like level 25. What the hell am i gonna do with a lvl 20/25 legendary? 
---
Why don't they scale to their region?
---
Vendor inventory is only shared for things players sell to a vendor. I.e. if someone sells a gun to a vendor you can buy that gun later. As for the vendors actual inventory that's randomized each time you hop even if you land in the same server. So things like mods or stealth boys or other stuff you might hop for that a vendor can sell is generated individually for each player on each server hop.
---
However if you're still dead set on finding new servers just join on people from your friends list who are on different servers
---
What's once?
---
Melee build, rarely use vats.  Yeah, I just bounce between caution and danger
---
all of them are unsubstantiated without controlled conditions. Proof is a bit lacking there
---
Show proof
---
 I'm a 72 year old Canadian, but thanks for the compliment. I keep threatening to move to Russia as I always like to be with the good guys. ;)
---
show proof otherwise
---
Your humor is offensively bad. Stop trying to be funny.
---
If you buy atoms already, then you have no leverage to negotiate any changes.
---
I'd love to stop by some time, you got T-60 mods?
---
Yeah same. I do have a rifle and still get sneak crits even in caution. So I assume it's just misinforming me. I feel like this use to happen a lot in FO3.
---
Send my salutes to Puttin when you get there
---
No I don't have that armour...I have tricentennial t51
---
There's an option to see all recipes you have, and all recipes you have the materials for. Or is that console-exclusive?
---
I nuked the pumpkin patch yesterday. Decent cobalt, not much else. 
---
I'm tired of the same ole same ole
---
Agreed but aggregate data and rates would be different from a leaderboard. 
---

---
 As I live in paradise on Vancouver Island its unlikely I'll move.
---
And can we list these quests by distance away! I would like to be able to look at the top and see current and nearby quests! 
---
Hes ran into me 4-5 times. Im suprised people dont find it more.
---
That ending tho
---
Wow the amount of dicks that replied. Don't bother replying now.i don't care about it,just like you don't care for others in game.
---
No. Still looting them here.
---
Yes but there's no option to see recipes you have "some" of the materials for. There's like 100 recipes, I don't want to page through them looking to see what I can make with honey for example. 
---
Only the Mothers drop them
---
Makes me think of people caring about their kd I. GTAO
---
Um where did you buy fo76 where it was 75 pounds?
---
I seen a guy glitch his plants indoor on a foundation.. He used campfires. I guess they snap onto campfires.
---
Still looting them from mole miner gauntlets
---
Wholeheartedly agree. I have 2 players on my friends list, who I "Bushwhacked" as they left the vault, to give them the best leather armour and gun I could possible make, just because I could. Pay it forward, even if you've not had a payout!
---
Nah, Don't complicate yourself buddy, just do it on your way is the best
---
Tried to add you. Your settings won't allow it. 
---
Scrap mole miner gauntlets (1 good Uranium Fever event should get you 30-40 gauntlets(teeth when scrapped,...plus steel,etc)
---
No problem haha
---
This would be a handy feature maybe they could do it the way the sorting feature works in your pipboy or while at a vendor. You could see which recipes you’re closest to creating or what takes fewest/ most ingredients.
---
I think about this when I think about the workshop nerf. 
---
Everyone else does it, and doesn't complain. What's a minute or 2 of scrolling gonna do?
---
Even after the loot loads, you get nothing good. Legit, I got a 1* Nocturnal Sickle one time... 
---
Kill the mole rat xD
---
Do you like your grits regular, creamy, or al dente? 
---
 I'm lost now. WTF are babbling about?
---
Any more, it's rare enough that I try to go when I can... *unless* it's a group of players launching one nuke after another.  Then, I figure, they've got some kind of system.
---
The reason it makes a difference is because if someone just launched what might be their first nuke, they want to kill the SBQ.  They would be thrilled to see half the server show up in support.  It would be so anticlimactic if they were all alone.
---
I am guessing they don't and just drop excess ingredients, which is what I usually do. This is a quality of life suggestion for cooking which is a detailed and under used system. 
---
I would love that... that would be a simple UI improvement
---
Sorry I send wrong message to you, when i trying to replying somebody else
---
Thank you for the replies
---
I would love to see some metrics, such as what percent of queen fights are successful (% by event, and % by player), stratified by the number of participants. I think you want to see more players equal higher success, but I suspect the data will show the opposite. 
---
it's a lvl 4 drop which means low chance, better to buy em of the market usualy goes for 3k each
---
Have you tried reinstalling? I only ask because I'm in the UK as well and haven't been having any server problems at all lately. What platform are you on?
---
So you guys are 3:pm yesterday for me, and it is 10:00am on Sunday here, I will be on from 2:pm my time 
---
I guess you're right
---
I’ll open them up
---
That, my friend, is really weird. Lol. I'll keep trying haha.
---
Thank you! That is the plan then.
---
Yep, I got 28 teeth and 488 steel from that event. 
---
Hence why I said "There's no way you'll hurt me,".  It does no damage, but it's dumb and I don't see why anyone that's a low level would decide to start shooting a level 50+ anyway. 
---
And not all level 1s know PVP doesn't unlock until level 5, not everyone knows 100% about a game before they start playing it. Some people like learning about games as they go. 
---
Like take it on and off when you want? 
---
The Queen can be boring in the sense that during some battles, she spends a lot of time doing absolutely nothing.  She'll just hover in the same place, or stand there on the ground, getting shot over and over again until she snaps out of it.  Yes, the Cryolator can deliberately do this, but this can happen on its own.  It's like her AI just stops working.
---
It isn't much fun to take on a bullet sponge that *knows* it's a bullet sponge.  At worst, it feels patronizing.
---
You love the idea of PVP so much, yet you dislike the idea of having to do it in a PVP server. 
---
There's only one possible reason for that. 
---
The 2/19 patch basically makes it way easier to take workshops and kill the current owner for caps. 
---
Pretty damn easy for a level 250 player to do that to a level 30 player.  
---
Not easy at all in a sever where level 250 is the norm and everyone has acquired OP weapons. 
---
You only want PVP in adventure mode because it makes it easy for you to prey on low level characters. 
---
I know this is true because I tested  it. 
---
I have a level 25 alt and nearly every time he takes a workshop, he gets it contested and is killed by someone level 100 or above. 
---
I have a level 210 character and this is much less of a problem. 
---
West Tek is a good spot to check. He's normally fleeing behind the building because of a bug. 
---
"Oh don't worry, we're looking into ways to make her loot more 'legendary' (and will probably have a solution for this in about six months)."
---
...demoralizing the playerbase of a multi-player game absolutely affects the game itself. 
---
Do you get an error code?
---
Haha, true. Maybe one of these days we'll do it. 
---
Actually not true. You're more likely to the remember the negative experience 
---
Is this in the steel mill?
---
If none of the above work, add these lines to A Fallout76Custom.ini:
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2
---
What's most irksome about comments like yours is that you're completely ignoring the reality that the vast majority of "hate" targeted at this game come from people who were psyched for it originally, but were disillusioned when it came out...or "hate" in the form of requests for basic fucking competency from people who play the game. 
---
And, of course, this isn't a fucking MMO, you idiot. 
---
Even if you aren't running mods the customini trick will fix it. 
---
Yes i would confirm that: resource cost/dmg per bullet is the gattling gun (NOT Minigun!!!) IMO the best way to go
---
I do dislike the nuking of parts just to change out your weapons functions, imagine gunsmiths in real life dumping anything they remove from a weapon and having to craft a new one from raw materials.
---
Yeah. So basically when you enter a building, you don’t need to switch to a non scoped weapon.
---
Had no idea, thanks for the tip ;)
---
Legit. Never considered this but I would be interested in this as well!
---
Nothing Typical Fallout 76 experience.
---
My Mum begs to differ.
---
I was having that issue too! Making a level 2 lock instead of 3 fixed it for me.
---
It’s just something I begin to notice a lot since I started using scopes more recently. Lol
---
Don't the bosses or mole rats with the crown only drop them?
---
Ah, pretty much how they already had on the offline Fallout games, which is strangely absent from this one.. 
---
It might be available as paid add on content.. knowing Todd Howard
---
There is a water fountain that provides sulfer water I believe it’s called but it’s real and does in fact cure your diseases with one sip. There is literally a sign saying it’s like some pre war health spring. When you spawn into whitesprings and the tennis court is on your right you want to turn around to head towards the whitesprings resort and turn left after the tennis court fence ends walk towards the dome with the lady  statue on top. There is a water fountain on the left hand side walk over n take a sip.
---
Scrap the plant to get a tarp, then replant it.
---
We thank you for your service sir! xD
---
To the op, vets to the queen fight were probably there. Like it seems we do a lot of the dps because guys don't bother to perk in any aa or have aa weapons. It's best to leave her uncrippled in the air but enagaged till she lands. We don't use +50 limb damage anymore, she tends to fly in one place instead of land and the melee can't do damage. Get a endangerol syringer too. Wait till she lands and if the melee is bad, perks like one gun army or tormentor keep her down until the adds show up.
---
Seen a lot of people using pumpkin grenades, but those aren't necessary. She runs from grenades if she's not crippled.
---
I’d like the idea. But rather let us take the sight mod or barrel mod off and have a chance roll if it becomes a mod we can freely attach again or break it 
---
UK also, steady as a rock for a few weeks now, only a couple of disconnects. This does sound like some hardware issue, maybe router related.
---
Have you set up you router for port forwarding?
---
[Fallout 76 Port Forwarding](https://portforward.com/fallout-76/)
---
Morgantown nuked it’s really good. 
---
I don’t think they “nerfed” any spots.  1*s are still common.   3*s have always been rare.  
---
I'll never forget when someone helped me out in MapleStory gave me tons of gold 10000 didn't meant much at the time cos once I actually got good I had upwards of a million but I still solo-d the game when I played but he rocked!
---
Oh, I know! I know.. Don't ever release a broken busted ass game? Am I right? 
---
Maybe also let us trade cards with friends too! 
---
Might just be a name plate. You can see names on the ones in Fo4. 
---
Yeah man, I don't know what to say. It's weird and I sound crazy but it just be that way sometimes.
---
As far as resources to produce ammo. I do use ammo smith when manufacturing ammo.
---
.45   gunpowder 3
---
         Lead             4
---
         Steel            10
---
               21 Rounds of 45 produced
---
5mm      gunpowder 8
---
                Lead            15
---
                Steel            30
---
                 180 Rounds of 5mm
---
Add Super Duper into the mix and you can make a lot of 5mm. I get 72 base damage no perks on my Lvl 50 Gatling gun. 
---
I would make both I love my lever action and Gatling Gun it really depends on how you play the game.
---
If you have any network lapse it disconnects almost immediately.  I have sporadic network issues—one second disconnects on a random basis even after replacing nearly everything—and such is not noticed by most apps but Fallout notices every time.  
---
The truth isn't popular around here. 
---
These are the locations and 3\* legendaries dropped in the past 3 weeks for me, an average of 6% of legendary encounters drop a 3\*:
---
`Whitesprings`: 11
---
`RobCo Research Center`: 4
---
`Watoga`: 3
---
`Harper's Ferry`: 3
---
`Fissure Prime`: 3
---
`Steakhouse`: 2
---
`Fissue Prime`: 2
---
`Blackwater Mine`: 2
---
`West Tec`: 1
---
`Watoga Clinic`: 1
---
`The Burning Mine`: 1
---
`Overgrown Sundew Grove`: 1
---
`Lewisburg`: 1
---
`Alpha`: 1
---
Nah, it's just that your question's posted all the time, and it's completely subjective. 
---
If you want to know what's been changed, the change logs are there. If you want to know what's coming, the roadmap is there.
---
I can't tell you what's "worth coming back for". 
---
I haven’t seen a nuke launched this entire week 
---
Add shrimp, butter, and seasoning to it and you’ll change your mind.   
---
I would give my first born for a 1\* Nocturnal Sickle and a wood leg O\_o
---
I’m IN vault 96 right now. No glitches or anything. I joined an event nearby and it teleported me inside of it. I’m on PS4
---
I’ve seen three. One, nobody showed up. The other two were less than five. 
---
I just hang out at the Fissure Prime and kill the hell outta everything..  Feels great to take down 4 scorchbeasts, over a dozen scorched, two mirelurk queens and one unlucky deathclaw all within ten minutes.. 
---
I would love different types of servers ... pvp only .. pvp/pve .. role play ... pve 
---
This is what I want to see one day. Each server with own name possibly but not really required. It's kinda hard to find. Most people I run into mostly want to stay solo, rare if I find someone that accepts my invite or get an invite. Granted I usually prefer solo but sometimes it be nice to stroll with someone on quests. 
---
I bet you're scrapping them by mistake, because they will always scrap to Bone when you Scrap All.  You need to set them aside first.
---
The most efficient way to get them that I've found is to kill Mole Miners in Welch and scrap their Mole Miner Gauntlet.  Each one yields 2 or 3 teeth, and there are quite a few of them to go around there.
---
Yeah, just like they fixed Radworms. Can’t wait 
---
Yeah. I had a 2 shot mirv fatman I called the carpet bomber in 4. When it worked it was beastly. 
---
In this game, even better, because you win no matter what. If you can get a bloodied, you'd be even better off. 
---
This guy is awesome, he did a great job for my t51, very professional and a pleasure to trade with 10/10
---
My numbers converge to [30-30-40](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wuz0Hej1N5UOeXGvXKiq6h9N-utjWjhiFdqXLvfDwu8/edit#gid=717308889) and 15% to find a 3\* enemy overall. For me, as far as I can remember, they were always rare and rarely finding 3\* in general. Nothing changed.
---
At level 100 and every 25 levels after that (rough estimates) allow us the option to completely respec (ie take all of our points and reallocate them in one swoop). The 2se nerf fucked my rifles build so now I have to grind levels to change my character to a 2 handed melee build and taking my perception down from 15 to 3 takes a whole lot of leveling, not to mention acquiring all the slugger perks, inscisor, etc. 
---
That's just what a duper would say. ;)
---
I shouldn't have to make a new character just to make wario in FO76. 
---
It actually increases the total damage and spreads it over a wider range. It launches six smaller bombs with lighter payloads on each. 
---
Probably harpoon gun. If you want to go cheap melee.
---
Just a tips for Taggerty, just run to the crystal cave or whatever it's called and loot the body. No need to do everything in between.
---
I have done all quests 4 times, did it on both 2 last characters. :)
---
Yep
---
I disagree that it’s pointless to ask though. Several people have given me answers that told me exactly what I wanted to know.
---
Either  its not in it, or it’s the river in the mire. It’s mostly in Virginia proper
---
Most of the day
---
I’ll be on tonight server hopping so this should confirm it. Usually the weekends have been busier but I doubt it
---
Yeah I can't believe they ever release fallout new Vegas. Game was a total mess. 
---
Launched a nuke last night and the countdown didn’t display for me after a couple seconds. 
---
I'll message you whenever I can get on
---
I’m in vault 94 right now! On ps4!!
---
YES THERES A WAY IN IM IM VAULT 94 RIGHT NOW EXPLORING!!!!
---
I didn’t know people actually use syringers? I guess I could have made a use of them at lower levs but it always seemed like a waste of time. 
---
I've never figured out the timing of blocks in this game, and I blame part of that on latency.
---
72!   You give me hope that my faculties and reflexes will be sufficient 20 years hence.  
---
On PC and last night was horrific. Everything was super slow to load and some towns had no junk...  just clean shelves as if junk didn't spawn in the first place. Containers had stuff, but no junk out in the open.   Server not responding messages about every 5 mins. 
---
Yeah private and player ran sever will rock one day. If they ever let us that is. I would buy this again for PC if they opened the option for mods and player servers. Currently on console.
---
I just want to clarify that this is BY FAR the best way to grind fusion cores. I got about 10 full charged ones in about 90 minutes
---
What kind of buzz blade? Was it at least a cool one?
---
U finna slap your mom tn?
---
I remember that one freaking glitch that froze the game involving a freaking hat.. A HAT
---
Screen cap it please? The curiosity is torturous. 
---
 A Reflex Sight is very good out to 100 yards or so. I have one on my Lever Action and if I need more range the Handmade with a Night Scope comes out.
---
 The ability to switch targets is hard to beat and really anything even somewhat close is easy. You don't NEED a scope often.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/7JqvwPS
---
What's the actual difference between the regular Gatling and the ultracite version?
---
I've also seen enclave-vRiBt weapons. What makes them unique? 
---
I believe it's the river that snakes along the east side of The Mire and Cranberry Bog.
---
76's map is roughly construed as West Virginia squished into a square shape.
---
Teach us your waaaaays! Please
---
Got one up right now on here and looking group on x box
---
I joined an event near it and it teleported me inside!!!
---
thanks

I actually enjoy finding a low lvl and helping them run missions or just let them tag mobs while I kill stuff. Breaks up the grind.
---
I like that they have a horseman suit for each major power armour type. I only wish there were excavator and Raider PA paints.
---
Yeah it definetly takes a long to re-specc your character and even more so when getting the perks to make that new build viable. 
---
I feel like of every excuse Bethesda has ever given us, that one *really* stood out to me because I have absolutely no idea why such a fix wouldn't literally take 5 minutes.  What is there to consider?  You already have some concept of rare plans (based on vendor price) - just throw one of those in with the Queen's loot.  Done.  Next.
---
An event just outside? I wonder if it’s just not active very often. Do you remember the name of it? 
---
I love my chameleon left leg armor with my sneak/rifle build. 
---
But it's really is annoying when I crouch and try to get some 2.5x dmg scorched headshots at mid range with my reflex handmade. I'm not bad at guessing where the dot is, but when I miss it just reminds me of what a terrible setup this is :/
---
I'm tempted to try a small scope, maybe that is visable, but I feel even the zoom on that will make it useless at short range.
---
Maybe I need to carry around 2 handmades, 1 for short and 1 for mid :(
---
Yes outside! And it was something about mirelurks. I was at my camp and saw events nearby. So I tapped on the one next to it and it loaded me inside of it. Almost died killing all of the mirelurks
---
The worst thing was, I had a 2se 50 cal and I was cultivating my heavy weapons build when the nerf hit. So I wasted even more levels developing that and now I wish I didn’t invest all those points into heavy weapons perks
---
I think that is wrong. I use it all the time and it always says "Sulpher" and it always cures me. 
---
The Three Ws is always good to me, have found usable good 3* at all locations recently: Watoga, Whitesprings, and West-Tek. Also Cranberry Bog events... AWOL Armaments, Monster Mash, and Hound Hordes. Hounds always set the highest level in my experience in the Bog, some of the other horde events vary, you can actually find a low level scorched for example
---
I was saying this from the first one I did. With nukacrypt solving them weekly, makes launching them childs play. I was all collecting codes and cards and remember my friend was in the silo and says. Where do you want it? No way he collected them all before me, we play together. I haven't purposely tracked the codes or cards from the terminal since. The bad thing is if they added more keywords (think there's 144 of them, can't remember) or if they even made it so you could only use one nuke card at the terminal. Mondays and maybe Tuesdays would be nukeless for sure as the keyword is blank.
---
My friend and I were planning on nuking something tonight. Maybe the steel mill? Maybe General's Steak House?
---
The steak house seems like it will be good for flux with the garden out back and that nearby farm. Plus the sundew grove if we position it right.
---
You can also use mats and put them on tables indoor also try putting a tomato on a dead planterpot looks amazing indoors.
---
It is possible, but there’s nothing to really back it up. Out of 500 people to leave a vault with little to know real combat expirience, I’d have to imagine atleast 150 were taken out by wildlife, plus many if not most of them died from the scorch plague shortly after. 
---
The scorch plague seems like an incredibly deadly and fast spreading disease, so just based on the evidence that it’s not in D.C. or Boston yet is probably good enough to say that it’s canon atleast a few 76 residents became immune to the plague and nuked the surrounding landscape to eradicate the plague. If they somehow made it through the intense radiation and blast, survived to kill the scorchbeast queen, and all the other mutants that came up, they’d have a hell of a story to tell when they left West Virginia and finally found civilization. 
---
If it ends up being canon that a handful of vault 76 residents made it out of the state after eradicating the plague, they’d be the new baddest badass in the fallout universe. Frank Horrigan has got nothing on them. 
---
I could kiss you, but I have an event to hunt down. Thank you. You’re awesome. 
---
Its very likely that we'll get a refund option for the perk cards since in the roadmap its full of ideas from the community.
---
Good luck!!! It’s big and full of plants and there seems to be some type of quest or something like that!!!
---
Not too many firearms allow for their scopes to be easily removed and swapped out.  It typically does require a workbench, vise, screwdrivers, Allan keys, etc.
---
Also, once a new scope is attached, the firearm must be sighted in for accuracy.  Yes, your firearm’s accuracy will be significantly affected.
---
Of course, I must remind myself that this is a video game where I know how to craft a missile launcher from scratch, but I’m unable to repair a bicycle.
---
So sure, with that in mind, swapping scopes on the fly would be useful, and it is annoying that I can’t build multiple scopes for the same firearm.
---
How do you even do this quest?
---
Randomly farm non-nuked whitespring
---
Right on, I'm curious about grafton.
---
Steak place is nice 
---
I wouldn't pay $60 with the current layout on the game but closer to $40 would be a reasonable price. Its definitely fun and even more so with friends. Also I initially paid $80 for the tricentenial edition (not worth it for a couple of skins) and I do enjoy playing the game, honestly haven't had much issues since the most recent patch on ps4
---
You should play some ark. 
---
I agree. Simply turn off PVP in Adventure, aside from Workshops an we'll be fine. Survival will be open season on anything that moves an you'll know what to expect if your in that mode.
---
On pc but Gl!
---
Op I'll just leave this here.

---
Lol
---
Maybe not "every" server. I've logged onto 3. No issues. Sucks you're having a rough time. Hope it gets resolved soon!
---
Really? Wow. I've never left the silo without fast traveling, so I never knew. I should find the exit sometime, just to collect them all, if for no other reason. 
---
Many people have done this
---
I thought luck if the draw was broken? I did hear that months ago though. 
---
Good on u guys,  I commend your creativity, effort,  and e_hussle, lol.   If only AAA devolperes had the heart u do the gaming industry would be a vastly different landscape than what we are presently witnessing. 
---
I got that from workshop I believe, maybe a few times. The one that I believe is rare is domestic kitchen table. Haven't seen that one drop yet. Only one need other than the park bench, but that supposed to be a rare vendor spawn at the watoga shopping center.
---
I took 3 last night. On the server for 4 hrs. It's possible to get them up quick if you have it basically memorized. Only problem with taking so many that in the middle of taking one another will have to be defended. 
---
Didn't know it could be modded, I assume this is on PC? 
---
I killed 5 in one day, two months ago. Thinking to myself, "Wow, this is easy!" 
---
I haven't seen any more since then. 
---
I found it once. Gave it to a dude who had the hat for it.
---
Didn't intend to be a dick about it, didn't know you could mod it without breaking it.
---
Have u checked you cannot craft the item
---
The Syringer/charisma builds will be huge when the vaults come out I think. Both the Mod you get from rose and the one for damage resistance have a lot of potential.
---
i killed 3 today. what a luck
---
What can we use honey for? I hold onto it because it doesn't spoil
---
I like the idea of planters because the terrain can be inconsistent for camp. 
---
If they could improve the dozing feature where we could terraform rocks to farm 8 wouldn’t need planter boxes.
---
Report him lol
---
pkchow! &lt;-that's my mind blowing
---
To my knowledge the only way to complete this quest once you're a high level character is to get a low level character to accompany you to the clubhouse and then you kill 'his' ghoulified golfers. Which is probably what happened to the level 370 guy. He probably ran into some low level guy checking out Whitesprings, which spawned the golfers which were miraculously not picked off by a Whitesping CAMPer and now that guy is gonna have to come back every couple of days and check for ghoulfers until he finally gets #10... probably somewhere around level 370.
---
Farm mothman eggs and make omelettes to sell for buttloads. Check back Avery so often for the eggs to respawn. Mothman will hunt you every so often too, so be aware. 
---
I love the creativity people have with their C.A.M.P builds, I'm just tolazy amd just a basic base with a few essentials.
---
Well done, looks really cosy but for the vertigo :)
---
I’ve been  at 8 of10, since December.
---
Yeah I've heard the exact same thing and between my buzz blades the extra swing speed doesn't seem to effect the main attack. I do need to see if it effects the power attack though. 
---
I would whittle the pool down. No wood, no syringers, no drills. Actual legendary three star items. Take the stalker tag off melees.
---
That's a pretty good point. Assuming our particular characters do exist in canon as ***the*** Vault 76 Dweller(s), we're some seriously hardcore motherfuckers. Despite how relatively intact it is, Appalachia is definitely one of the more hostile pockets of the wasteland out of the whole series. If it weren't for the Enclave being neutral to us (considering they were the main threat in California and the Capitol Wasteland), Appalachia would probably be more threatening than every other playable area from Fallout, combined.
---
That's fair -- I never used them as I preferred the nuclear fusion generator.
---
oh man, what?  I didn't know that.  Now I totally want to buy them.
---
I'm  not on yet but u can join me at whitespring 
---
pvp server is on the neqar horizon dont worry
---
Umm this is a sandbox game..you are supposed to create the story
---
Why would a syringer work on robots?
---
I like my gritz like I like my women, corny.
---
What platform?
---
then try Creme of Wheat its similar but not. 
---
Otherwise, you may have under cooked your gritz if it tasted like sand.
---
Oooooh... Does it actually auto-learn plans you bought now? If so I apologise.
---
Thank you. :)
---
I really enjoy building, so when I'm tired of grinding for plastic and steel I work on my camp. :p 
---
Doing it right now, that criminal scum :@
---
PA will allow you to breath underwater. 
---
There's a perk card that's let's your breathe underwater and it stops rad damage from being in water
---
yes
---
Power armor works.
---
I did mine way back when I was level ~10. They seem to spawn only if you are lower level. Kinda hard to do nowadays, as Whitespring is full of high levels.
---
Isn't Shenandoah in Virginia?
---
The classic bethesda meme
---
It doesn't. 
---
Happens to me every time now. I liked having it to time fast travelling to the nuke zone a little better. Other people I play with can see it the whole countdown.
---
Yeah I was stuck at 1 for weeks. At Lv 105 now and killed 5 in one day. Wish they would fix the spawns for those
---
